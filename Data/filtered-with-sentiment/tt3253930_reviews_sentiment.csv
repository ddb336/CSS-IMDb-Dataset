" Great Thriller
",0.6705,0.9039,2021-04-11 00:00:00,9,This is a great mystery thriller with two interesting lead characters. The story unravels well and is quite tragic as the victims are beautiful young women being taken advantage of. The performances and filmmaking is high quality with really visually cool locations.
" Great Spanish Film
",0.6249,0.9313,2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Great Spanish police suspense, which captures attention from start to finish. In addition to the main plot, there is a small plot involving the past of one of the detectives and the political belief of the other. Furthermore, there is no way to stop praising the beautiful photograph from the film, with beautiful aerial shots. Although, in the beginning, it may seem a bit cliché, it is a real breath in the midst of so many police films that always fall in common. It's worth watching."

",0.5719,0.128,2020-11-28 00:00:00,8,"Two cops with conflicting methods and character out to track down a serial killer set admist a corrupt 80's south of Spain. Javier Gutiérrez is the standout for me here, as his character is complex and troubled, with turns of nastiness and charm. All performances are good. The story well paced and realistic. The direction fautless, and beautiful cinematography throughout. As a movie that went under the radar for many, Marshland was a pleasant surpriseA top notch crime thriller."
" Unfussy
",0.0,-0.4773,2020-11-12 00:00:00,6,In the best sense a clear and straightforward crime story. No whistles and bells - at all - but also no massive twist or surprise at any point. The photography and shots are very well done and capture the time and local flavor perfectly. a side note which I personally found irritating. The Excessive use of animals / dead animals. Not sure if this was necessary from a story telling POV.
" Dazzling spanish thriller
",0.1027,0.886,2020-10-07 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie to be savoured: the acting is good, the plot intriguing with the story nicely paced, and the production values are high quality. From the get-go, you are drawn into the story and made to feel as if you're part of the experience. That's good storytelling and production."
" Very good film
",0.4927,-0.6378,2020-07-29 00:00:00,8,"Very good film about the investigation of a crime by a serial killer. The story is captivating and holds you in the armchair until the plot unfolds. It has elements similar to other ""serial killer crimes"" films. Despite a few flaws in the script, it is consistent, logical, and well written and linked. I strongly recommend it to everyone."
" Awfully overrated
",0.0,-0.0258,2020-07-25 00:00:00,4,It's an average crime thriller with a strong atmosphere that hides its outstanding lack of originality. Some loose ends. An unwarranted sub-story about police corruption and the heritage of Franco's regime: what was the purpose of it? Overall it's more of a tv product than a movie.
" Spanish Noir

Local corruption and protection of the wealthy impede their inquiries. A dark, violent film. murders, tortures, but the worst excesses take place off camera or are alluded to.

" it is a beautiful shot movie with good historical insight and technically flawless, but i felt a bit short on plot.
",0.6757,0.9943,2020-05-13 00:00:00,7,"""la isla minima"" is a great movie about those type of places everyone wants out due to lack of opportunities. Placing this at the beggining of the 80's right after franco's dictatorship (i'm portuguese and we're actually were in very similar periods in these times) gives the extra conflict and darkness to the movie, because everyone was 1 - pretty much ashamed to talk about things ""outside normality"" and 2 -having an utmost respect for leaders and rulers no matter how corrupt or shady they were - unfortunatly both portugal and spain still suffer this mostly in small places like the one depicted here, ewhere everyone knows and needs each other to get into something.the movie starts very well by in one scene giving the viewer enough information about the difference between both characters: one way more used to this type of mechanics and the other trying to break them out: the scene where both talk to the police is very self explanatory and interesting because in less than one minute we realized how different these guys were: right at the beggining of the film. the movie doesn't need a lot of explanation to why these characters are different and gives them a good meaning just in few small details: the characterization of both policemen was really well done.then this was shot beautifully: there are big camera shots where we can see all the action in front of us, glorious panoramics towards the fields, a deep sense of claustrophobia in open air, like we feel why people want to move from there: we feel they're inside a ""hole"" - this also has amazing cinematography, the colors here are astonishing and the music depicts very well the state of abandonment these people feel. technically is flawless is one of the most beautiful movies i saw recently without any doubt. it also shows some historical context by giving the ""party period"" of the village and worker's strikes that i thing were interesting to follow.now the plot: it's not bad not by any means but... i don't believe is the strongest point. the pace is good even though this moves slow (it had to and it works completely) but it then works almost like a procedural tv show: they see ""x"" talk to ""y"" gather evidence, talk to ""y again"" and then reach a conclusion. i don't think this is bad per se but there's no more characters to follow besides the two policemen. all the characters around them serve just one purpose: to move the plot forward or to enhance the conflicts they have with themselves or each other. i didn't find any character with sould and deepness besides the main two. that and an ending that doesn't satisfy completely, even though it's not bad - again, are the two points against it.the film won several awards and deserves them mostly from the technical standpoint. the background story about the history period this took place was also well done - and i think it's because of that this film won several screenplay awards. for the procedural per se i do think it fells short and should have taken other narrative options - and having more solid characters besides the main two. I might change the grade later, it's almost an 8 for me. but since i found the plot a bit predictable i'll stick with a seven for now."
" A slick, well-paced Spanish crime thriller! [+72%]
",-0.5255,0.9913,2020-05-05 00:00:00,7,"I stumbled upon Marshland while searching for international serial-killer thrillers. Marshland really took me by surprise in almost every aspect. The wheaty filter (used by cinematographer Alex Catalán) lends a distinctive tone to the film, which is set in the Guadalquivir Marshes (in 1980s Spain). Two officers, Juan and Pedro, are sent to this marshy little town to investigate the missing of two teenage girls. But there's a lot more to it. The moment we first see the duo together, we sense an uneasiness between them. We later get to know that it's because of their different political ideologies, outlook towards women, and their respective pasts - it's called character development 101!Writer-director Alberto Rodriguez is clearly not after cheap thrills here - except for a single scene, his intention isn't to make viewers gape in disbelief at the terrifying nature of the crimes. He wants to weave an intricate story around the disappearance of some young girls and their supposed link to a murderer. The clues unravel slowly, there's plenty of expository dialogue. There's a scene of a woman walking down a pitch-dark road probably on her way back home from work when the cops pass by in their car. This scene, though a minor one, opens the door to many questions (especially regarding the safety of women).Alberto writes Pedro as a more sensitive officer (and human being) - he cares for his wife but knows that the job is taking a toll on him; he almost throws up (in a scene that'd be a bit of a spoiler), and his desperation to unearth the killer is revealed in a scene (late into the film) where he and Juan meet their superior. Juan, on the other hand, has a murky past (which is an interesting political subplot of its own), enjoys his share of wine and merry-making with women at local bars, and isn't scared to question a woman the hard (read: nasty) way, if necessary. In essence, Pedro is the new definition of (socialist, democratic) Spain while Juan embodies its Francoist past.The plot thickens with each passing scene. The director mounts suspense with every little revelation, finally tying loose ends up together in a thrilling climax. This is a whodunnit as well as a character study - but the two styles are merged in a subtle manner. The 80s setting is also used to great effect to keep the narrative crisp and rich in atmosphere. The political unrest in the country post-Franco's rule is integral to the events that play out in the film.In terms of action, we get a nicely staged car-chase sequence and a climax that goes guns blazing amid the rainy bogs. It's a slickly written and directed thriller - the kind I can never get tired of watching."
" Good photography with lots of gaps and loose ends.
",0.1531,-0.2732,2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"The two stars acted out their roles brilliantly.
Fantastic cinematography and backdrops.
Screenplay tight dropped the ball in the end.
Blood type AB nor accounted for.
Last 10 minutes abruptly finalised with the killer.
What about the rich man with the soft hands and cologne?
Loose ends as no explanation how or why the killings took place."
" Who decides whether one is good or evil?
",-0.3612,0.9502,2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,"I have to say this engaging, visually brilliant and disturbing thriller is one very good film.Intense scenes separated by pause of the marshland scenery or surreal scenes like the bird in the room or woman walking in the dark make you pause as an audience and reflect with the detectives. It not every film that allows the audience to be part of the story.Released in same year if you have seen True Detective season 1, will see the similarities in the appearance of the lead characters, the premise and pace of story telling.Overall a very good thriller, very much recommended."
" killer thriller
",-0.5994,0.9136,2020-01-06 00:00:00,7,"The movie itself starts with some aerial shots of Andalusia, in fact the Guadalquivir Marshes, but as the movie starts we are straight into the action, no padding here as two girls have gone missing, and two out-of-favour detectives from Madrid are sent there (against their wishes) to investigate. Pedro & Juan
Both had moments of insight, and brutality, yet one was introspective, and the other extraverted. Pedro was the strong, silent, and menacing type, and Juan was outgoing but insightful, and slightly untrustworthy.The old man with the hat, who had the young girls taste never seemed to have some clarified. And case just wrapped up abruptly. Blood AB did it belong to the maniac or the old man? Never explained clearly.The above mentioned flaws stopped me from giving this film a higher rating.
Good Movie, Excellent Making And Music Was Played A Huge Role in Movie As Well As The Cinematography."
" Basically a flawless Spanish mystery/thriller.
",0.5106,0.9662,2019-08-15 00:00:00,10,"""Marshland"" is a perfect paced thriller, which, in this case, means a couple of notches down from how Hollywood would do it. The story unfolds in some unexpected and some predictable ways, which keeps you on your toes throughout, and the tension is ratcheted up continuously as the film moves on to it's conclusion. The cinematography is brilliant, along with the settings, and perfectly matches the pace of the film. I'm stretching to find a negative with this film, but the best that I can do is to mention that you have to read subtitles, but they're easy to read, even though they are white and not yellow. Pretty much a flawless film if what you're looking for is a gritty, brilliantly shot, mystery/thriller which builds tension carefully and slowly right up until it's very end."
" What a movie! enjoyed every minute watching it

" Nothing muddy about this marshland thriller
",0.1027,0.9485,2019-03-03 00:00:00,8,"The great cinematografic landscapes, the slow -but not to slow- pace, the social/political background, the atmosphere, the two lead roles... everything in this movie combined makes this a great movie. Sure, thee storyline is largely predictable but that doesnt influence the overall verdict. Watching this Spanish movie is a treat."
" Suspenseful Spanish detective story investigating the murder of 2 girls in Spain. Great Spanish acting performances, with beautiful photography.
",0.5106,0.8271,2019-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Suspenseful detective story about the investigation into the murder of several girls in a rural village in Spain. This story is intermingled with some political references to the dictatorship of Spain by Franco during the seventies, although at heart it is mostly a thrilling detective story.Great acting performances by Spanish actors. Beautiful photograhphy. Dark and looming soundtrack. Definitely one of the best foreign detective stories I have watched in years."
" Incredibly Tense
",-0.4005,0.9154,2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,"A tense and gripping crime drama with incredible script and acting. Visually gritty and gorgeous at the same time, the aesthetic is another high point, which almost works as a separate character. The pacing is almost perfect, constantly building tension and feeding you just enough information to keep you wanting more.The political undertones of post-dictatorship Spain are an added bonus, and add a significant layer to the richness of this film.The parallels to True Detective season 1 are incredibly, and it seems almost impossible that these 2 projects were developed completely independently, although it seems that's the truth"
" Detective movie at its best
",0.6369,-0.4153,2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"Marshland or La Isla Minima is one of the few crime movie which sticks to reality .The movie takes place after the 'the long dark night of dictatorship' .Two police officers with different ideology are brought to the Marshland area with the purpose of bringing two missing girls home.When the girls are found dead and raped, the simple case becomes a case which they have to solve.
Marshland is very realistic police story.The police were not controlled in the Francisco Franco's regime.Hence when Spain became a democracy the police had to be extra careful while investigation.Here the officers are always in the grey of what to do for it being the ethical way of investigation.
Marshaland has a beautiful cinematic scenery.The cinematography is top of the charts with apt music.
Crime Lovers do give it a watch .You wont regret it."

" Dark and gritty thriller
",0.1027,0.67,2019-01-05 00:00:00,8,"We know the set-up from endless crime stories. We follows the two detectives; the ""good guy"" Pedro, and the brutish and hot-tempered Juan, who are sent to a small town society in the marshland of Spain in 1980 to unravel the murder of two young sisters. But as the story unfolds and we learn more about the investigation and the background of the detectives, we are dragged into a societal marshland that is just as muddy and dirty as the surroundings. Besides being a regular crime thriller, this also turns out to be a criticism of corruption and the political system in 1980s Spain. The story is well-written and well-executed and ends up being much more than just another crime story. The acting is credible and subtle, the score is intense and fits the film perfectly, but especially the tone is great. The tone is quite similar to True Detective (also from 2014 as this one) with the yellow-ish color scheme, the dry and desolate landscape and the dark and rather depressive atmosphere. The pacing is slow and the combination of the score, the tone and the cinematography (in particular the bird's eye shots of the roads and landscapes) adds up to a pretty great, dark and gritty experience."
" Beautiful Landscape and excellent camera work/Cinematography
",0.8225,0.9547,2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"Hi,
I was bored of modern thrillers and investigations.
For a change I wanted to watch a thriller where there was no modern technology used like Mobile/Cell phones.
Finally I ended up on this wonderful movie. Through out the movie I was so involved with the beauty of landscape, I had a guilt feeling like, ""why these crime screen has to happen in such a beautiful place"". But that added a pace and calmness for the investigation. Without much of violence and not much of shooting/gun noise the movie will end.
Thanks,
Meena."
" Phantastic
",0.0,0.6917,2018-11-25 00:00:00,8,"Story, Cinematography, Characters, Tension - it's all here. La Isla Minima is a very engaging movie from start to finish. The atmosphere and the scenery, along with the progression of the plot keeps you constantly 'in'.For those who seen the first season of 'True Detective' it would by very reminiscent. Two detectives, trying to solve the murder mystery and track a serial killer. The atmosphere is very reminiscent to the series and overall has the same phantastic quality, which I find quite rare for this genre.It is a very well crafted, haunting thriller/detective story that statys with you after the credits roll. Totally recommended for those who love the genre. With that said, La isla minima is not an easy watch due to it's subject matter and not something I'd love to view again soon."
" Less than its parts
",0.0,-0.7249,2018-11-04 00:00:00,6,"Alberto Rodriguez' film 'Marshland' tells the story of a grizzly murder in a remote deltaic region shortly after the fall of Franco. With its combination of atmospheric setting, an insular community, and post-fascist politics, it should be gripping. But it's a low-budget and (mostly) low-key affair, the exposition of the plot isn't always crystal clear and the integration of the political backstory with the foreground plot is underdeveloped. I've seen worse films, but I was hoping for more here, and didn't find it."
" Dull
",-0.4019,0.2732,2017-12-07 00:00:00,6,"So many unnecessary characters and scenes in a film that runs out of steam before the finish-line. Also, it seems the director has a childish fascination with silly drone shots...Again unnecessary. This film was trying to make so many points that it ended-up making none. Watching this became tiresome after the first 15 minutes."
" A taste of true detective
",0.4215,-0.9517,2017-11-24 00:00:00,7,"Stunning landscapes, and dark secrets, combines into a chilling story, with believable roles.

" Moody thriller with stunning landscapes, an intriguing mixture of genres and authentic characters
",0.128,0.9955,2017-07-26 00:00:00,9,"La Isla Minima, also known as Marshland, is a Spanish thriller that has won ten Goya Awards, the Spanish equivalent of the Academy Awards. For once, this film truly deserves the praise it got. The story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of two teenage girls in the desolate countryside deep in Spain's south. Two homicide detectives need to work together and soon uncover more mysterious disappearances related to their case.There are numerous elements that make Marshland an outstanding movie. One element are definitely the landscapes and locations. The southern marshland looks desolate and raw as one can discover both beauty and despair in such a place. The movie takes us into shady bars, into spare hotel rooms, on dusty roads and into numerous abandoned and isolated buildings. Most characters don't really like to live in this place which has an impact on the gloomy atmosphere of this movie.A key element behind this movie's success are its two charismatic main characters. Pedro Suarez is a young, motivated and ambitious homicide detective who is openly critical of Spain's past during the Franco dictatorship. His critical and direct attitude helps him to solve his cases but it also creates conflicts with his more conservative superiors which is the reason why he got sent away from the Spanish capital to the marshland. On the other side, Juan Robles seems to be a calm and sociable homicide detective who doesn't question his superiors and who gets along with local people which helps him to get more information than his colleague because people trust him and don't only see him as police officer. On the other side, he can get quite brutal and emotional at times and seems to have a shady past as well as a dark future.Another convincing element of this movie is its mixture of genres. Even though it is mainly a thriller and focuses on a story with a few gruesome twists, this movie is also the portrait of a country that is going through important changes. The movie takes places in the early eighties, just a few years after the end of the brutal Franco dictatorship. Some characters desire to embrace democracy, move on and open the country towards the world. Others are still stuck in the old system and use bribes, corruption and violence to become or remain influential. Some characters seem to be lost between both worlds as they face demons from the past but are also afraid of what lies ahead. This movie is an authentic drama, historical portrait and character study all at once. It's also a road movie as the main characters walk, drive or take the boat to investigate their case in the marshland numerous times.To keep it short, Marshland is a very convincing thriller that stands out thanks to a coherent yet diversified mixture of genres, two very interesting and profound main characters portrayed by the excellent actors Raul Arevalo and Javier Gutierrez and atmospheric, charismatic and unique landscapes and locations. La Isla Minima is one of the very best thrillers in recent memory and I would definitely recommend it and watch it again myself."
" Good thrilling movie with great performances
",0.8779,0.9794,2017-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Set up in 1980's two homicide detectives were sent to a remote town to investigate the disappearance of teenage sisters. During their investigation they found similar cases of girls disappearing in the past which lead them to think that they are after a serial killer.With stellar performances from Juan (Javier Gutiérrez) and Pedro (Raúl Arévalo), beautiful locations and superb writing La Isla Minima is definitely one of the best thrilling movies of 2014. In some ways it reminds me of the True detective season 1 with long roads shots, isolated houses and dark forests. If you are into classic thrilling movies like Se7en, Silence of the lambs, Bone collector etc. you are going to appreciate this movie so go for it."
" Dark and Deep, Spanish Cinema at its Finest
",0.0,0.8887,2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"First, I must say that I speak Spanish and that makes my experience a little different than people who watched with subtitles. What an astonishingly well-made movie. The acting is suburb, and the cinematography is nothing short of magnificent. This movie is an emotional roller coaster, containing moments of heartbreak, suspense, and relief. The Marshland is set in 1970's Spain, at the end of the fascist Franco regime. The two main characters, both detectives, appear to be polar opposites when it comes to ideology. This strain between the two protagonists adds a lot to the tone and the direction of the film. There are many unpredictable moments. There aren't many boring moments, overall the film keeps the audience engaged until the end when the suspense builds up to a satisfying finish. Excellent cinema, I'll definitely be looking forward to more great movies coming out of Spain."
" A future modern classic?
",0.0,0.7455,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"In a time when it seems every film that released is over hyped and thus a disappointment, it is heartening when you see a film that is every bit as good as you had hoped. Marshland is is one of those films.Most reviews here praise the photography, suspense and story line which are at times mesmeric but I also liked the setting and the feel of the film as well as the humble characterisations. I have also watched a little of True Detective which other reviewers have mentioned, there is simply no comparison as Marshland is a far better project. I am sure this will become a classic.It is disappointing that only one poor and misguided reviewer here has lowered the films rating."
