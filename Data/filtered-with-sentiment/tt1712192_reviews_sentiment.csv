" Not bad and good ending.
",0.1139,-0.5789,2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Certainly shows the gritty underbelly of LA. Not the South Central gang-centric scenes we are normally given but how other nations have infiltrated and made it their crime bed too.Some of the content piqued my interest so know I know a bit more about South African prison gang culture, interesting knowledge is never bad.The story is fairly sound, person missing, person looks for person, a bit of blackmail and violence, but the end (in my opinion) was a surprise and good."
" Right guys, we have ¬£100 and no script. Let's make a movie!
",-0.3595,0.9692,2021-03-27 00:00:00,2,"This film is great if you want to see a moody man, staring for long periods of time and talking in a language which is impossible to understand.Is it boring? Yes
Is it predictable? Yes
It Chadwick's acting really that good? Sadly, no
Has the story been done better? Yes, way better
Would you recommend this film? NoWas there anything good about the film? Ummmmmm Oh yes, I liked the font on the credits.To sum up, it's too long and boring. Go watch Denzel in the Equaliser or John Wick or Taken or 2 Girls one cup."

" I'll remember this in a positive manner
",0.5574,0.9735,2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Chadwick Boseman carries it no doubt, but I did feel entertained throughout by 'Message from the King'.It's a simple film. It doesn't do anything revolutionary or anything, yet still managed to keep me watching with interest for practically all of the 102 minute run time. I like how it starts most, with the connections feeling believable. It loses some of that as it goes on, though it didn't affect my enjoyment all that much.Boseman really is the only true star of this though, as he gives a very good performance in the lead role as Jacob. Luke Evans (Paul) is pleasant too, while Teresa Palmer (Kelly) has a few moments. Alfred Molina (Mike) also appears, as do Messrs Draco Malfoy and Brad Bellick...The ending isn't the greatest, though it is still serviceable. That coupled with the nice look of the film and a certain Mr. Boseman mean I'll remember this in a positive manner."
" Solid 6
",0.1531,-0.6084,2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,"This movie is quite gritty and dark, it shows the underbelly of LA. I found all of the actors very good. Boseman is solid as ever. I am not sure what would have pushed it into a 7/10. I have seen some of the very negative reviews and I think it's a little unfair. I would give it a go if you have a few hours spare"
" Taken lite
",0.0,0.8354,2021-02-21 00:00:00,4,"Message from the king is described as a neo-noir action thriller staring the late Chadwick Boseman, a dark and moody tale of the criminal underworld and revenge. It all sounds very exciting, however the end result unfortunately falls somewhat flat.Let's start with some positives.
Chadwick Boseman delivers a very strong performance, with just the right amount of calm and broody to hold the viewers attention, the story itself wasn't an awful attempt and actually was fairly simple to follow. The supporting cast were also not all tragic which in many movies like this anyone who isn't the hero or the villain can easily be forgotten however, when it comes to the good that is pretty much it.In contrast to my previous point about supporting cast being good there was also a rather large degree of overacting making some scenes almost cringy and even now having watched it i'm still unsure what the whole point was of the movie overall, everyone acted like they had something to hide even the shop owner who litterally was on screen for 2 scenes, all the fight scenes happened with the lights off and the camera moved so quickly you couldn't really assess what had happened and the twist at the end was very uninspired. Overall not a bad film but I absolutely wouldn't be shouting from the rooftops to add it to anyone's movie collection."

" Solid revenge based movie.
",-0.4215,0.9702,2021-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Suprise find that I thoroughly enjoyed.It was interesting to see the usual theme turned round as in 'Get Carter' an outsider has a score to settle in a hostile environment.I can't help but wonder if this wouldn't have been more acceptable to some if the situation had been reversed and it was an American in South Africa? Not that either side hasnt had it's 'Toxic' aspects shown before!
Throughout the story the thought kept active as to just what kind of a character 'Jacob' was 'at home' so the ending was a nice touch!
While it was a well worn path,this was an interesting and well delivered story with some engaging Characters and not quite the usual moral polarity.
I scored it on how much I enjoyed it and how grateful I was for the distraction from the current endless 'House arrest and forced hibernation' that has become life in 2021 U.K.,so it's probably fair to say that my perameters of reference are not as usual!"
" Not bad at al)
",0.431,0.6829,2020-12-31 00:00:00,7,"Definitely not a 10 , but reasonably decent revenge film. I liked the more realistic feel to It, not usual exaggerated fights and chases...more in style with European movies. Very solid one time watch."
" Worth watching twice

or more times this year, out of about 150 movies (pandemia, what else can we do?), and this one for the acting and the final five minutes, one of the best endings I've seen this year. You really feel for The King, Chadwick was outstanding. What a loss. A few complaints: The plot was a little too convoluted, like, why involve the politician? And corrupt Keystone Cops that are totally incompetent? Sometimes keeping it simple is better. But after all the mayhem and some tearful scenes, the twist at the end actually is a feel-good moment, at least for me."
" Chadwick was a Brilliant Actor
",0.5859,0.9601,2020-12-20 00:00:00,3,"Chadwick was a Brilliant actor however there are a lot of brilliant South African actors who could have played his character. With that said, for me - the plot was armature. Now, if I was in college sitting around a big screen TV with friends eating popcorn and drinking beer and soda pop while laughing and joking I am certain I would have given this movie a 10 instead of a 3."

" Leave a message.
",-0.0516,-0.8002,2020-10-14 00:00:00,6,"This solid, if forgettable, mystery-thriller follows an African man who comes to Los Angeles in search of his sister after receiving a distressed voicemail from her. 'Message From The King (2016)' gets progressively darker as it goes along, starting out with drug abuse and petty crime before transitioning to bigger and infinitely more sinister transgressions. It has a decent atmosphere to it and its performances are suitably grounded. It's also typically rather entertaining, with its mystery being slowly unveiled in a believable sort of way. It is, however, ultimately pretty generic and it doesn't leave all that much of an impression. Its action is also rather shaky and in itself doesn't really impress, though its impression - or, perhaps, result - is usually impactful. Overall, the flick is an enjoyably dark thriller that doesn't quite have the staying power it ought to. 6/10"

They could have added more substance to it. Nevertheless, it's a solid simple flick.The Ending was damnableVerdict: I didn't watch this movie because he died, like everyone else did.

" When it hits, it hits... but sometimes it misses
",-0.3291,-0.8684,2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Ooh boy, here's a toughie.Chadwick Boseman, we barely knew ye. Two seconds after you broke onto the A List, you left us all in shock when you departed this world, the consensus being that it was well before your time. While arguments can be made one way or the other about such things, one thing is certain:You made an impact.MESSAGE FROM THE KING is not the best movie I have ever seen, unfortunately. It has pacing issues, continuity problems, and questionable dialogue choices. All that being said, Chadwick steals every scene with his powerful performance, and at least that's worth something.It's not all bad. A man from South Africa comes to Los Angeles, searching for what happened to his missing sister. Without spoiling too much of the film, he finds out, and then wants to settle scores for what has happened.In an attempt to create an original plot, some things get lost. There is a scent of mystery here, well played by the creators... we don't know who Jacob King is, or WHAT he is, beyond being a loving sibling who's well beyond furious as to the events as they unfold, and that part of the film works fine. In an effort to keep the mystery going, we are given a seedy, not terribly friendly portrait of Los Angeles life, and the downfalls some who go looking for dreams fall into.Teresa Palmer plays a kindly neighbor, one who is involved in doing whatever is necessary to keep the roof over her and her daughter's heads. There is chemistry here, at first easily dismissed, but I have to speak about a scene which is my favorite of the film, in which she surprises him in a diner, sits down with him, and thanks him for not being the same as everyone else she's met since she fell into the luring trap of Hollywood. The exchange between the two of them is touching, heartfelt, heart wrenching, and immediately breathes life into what could have been easily written off as a simple revenge movie.The level of violence here is high, perhaps a bit too high in certain scenes. Violence done realistically is rarely a treat to the eyes... I remember a scene from DRIVE in which a woman's head is taken off with a shotgun blast and you can see every gory detail of brain, blood, and bone as her head explodes in slow motion, and I find it jarring every time I see the movie. It doesn't need to be there, and sometimes in this film the violence comes off in a similar fashion.I also mentioned the dialogue before... there's a lot of empty words thrown in the usual manner of macho bull and cliched banter. Alfred Molina and Luke Evans, specifically, have the worst lines to spout here, as they have to shout pointless insults back and forth at each other that only serve to take up time, instead of entertain us or keep the plot moving.There's also a few plot twists that seem overly heavy, once again done for the sake of originality but lacking in a real sense of logic or reasoning that you accept just because you don't really have any other choice once you get into the parts of the movie that really work... you kind of just have to roll with the punches.All in all, it's not bad. If you love and miss Chadwick, give it a roll. It's not as good as PANTHER. I suppose, in the end, when we remember him, nothing he did is going to compare with that.Godspeed, Mr. Boseman. You will be missed."
" Message from the King
",0.0,-0.998,2020-09-10 00:00:00,5,"The death of Chadwick Boseman, aged only 43 from colon cancer, was a huge shock, he had been hiding his diagnosis for the last four years. The world recognises him as Black Panther, his full career only lasted just over a dozen films, including this one that I chose to watch, following the news of his passing. Basically, Jacob King (Chadwick Boseman), who lives in Cape Town, South Africa, receives a message from his estranged sister Bianca (Sibongile Mlambo), who lives in Los Angeles, that she is in trouble and has something ""they"" want. King flies to the United States, intent on finding his sister, and has seven days to do so. Upon arriving at his sister's address, a neighbour, Trish (Natalie Martinez), is there with some of Bianca's belongings. The neighbour tells him that Bianca has disappeared, and that his sister's husband had disappeared earlier, leaving his son with Bianca. Jacob finds Bianca's landlady, who says that local business owner Zico (Lucan Melkonian) paid Bianca's rent before she left, and that Bianca had been beaten up before departing. King finds Zico with a group of men, and they deny any knowledge of his sister. A local shopkeeper tips King to look for his sister in the morgue, and King is devastated to find Bianca's corpse there, tortured and mutilated. Among Bianca's belongings, King finds photographs of her with various men, including the gang member who had paid her rent, a dentist's business card, and a pack of cigarettes. King confronts Zico and mutilates his face, telling him to tell his superior, Duke, that this is ""a message from the King"", and then steals Zico's phone. At a party held by Trish, King learns that Bianca had been associated with the gang and drug dealer Frankie (Harry Potter's Tom Felton). He confronts Frankie and beats him for information, then steals his phone. Back at the motel, King accidentally interrupts a prostitute, Kelly (Teresa Palmer), he does not call the police, she allows him to take her car. King goes to meet the dentist, Dr. Wentworth (Luke Evans), pretending to be referred by his sister, Wentworth tells him that Bianca was being pimped out to pay her husband's debts and that she often went missing. After the meeting, it is revealed that she was involved with politician Frank Leary (Chris Mulkey) who is running for office, who gives Wentworth the contact details for two hitmen to take care of King. King follows Wentworth to the home of wealthy Hollywood producer Mike Preston (Alfred Molina), whom Wentworth demands $100,000 to cover the cost of the hitmen, and another $750,000 of blackmail money due to his involvement with Bianca's death. Whilst there, King sees his sister's stepson, Armand (Diego Josef), is living at the mansion. Wentworth notices King's car when leaving and calls the hitmen. Later that day, the hitmen, two LAPD officers, arrest King. King realises he is going to be killed, he is beaten badly, but manages to escape. Kelly finds King near the motel and nurses him back to health in her room. King recovers from his wounds and creates a bomb out of materials from a hardware store, then in the pack of cigarettes from Bianca's belongings finds an encrypted SD card. Realising this is what her killers wanted, he listens to snippets of audio and discovers Preston is targeted. He sneaks into Preston's home and forces him to decrypt the file, which reveals camera footage of Preston committing abusive acts on Armand during a party. Preston reveals that Bianca's husband had fallen into serious debts, and those he owed forced Bianca to take drugs and pimped her out to pay them back. They killed her husband but continued to pimp her out, so she sold her stepson to Preston for money. When she realised Armand was being raped by Preston, she stole the footage and called King for help. Preston asked Wentworth to fix the problem, and Wentworth hired the gang members to kill Bianca. King lures Duke (Arthur Darbinyan), his gang members, and Wentworth to Preston's mansion. He kills Preston, while Duke and Wentworth are killed by the bomb planted in a packet of money. King takes Armand back to the motel to rest with Kelly and her daughter, but a surviving gang member who King maimed earlier ambushes them in his room. The boy escapes before King kills the gang member. He runs after Armand but cannot see him and gives up. King drops Kelly and her daughter at the bus stop where they plan to return to New Mexico, and he gives her a bag of money he took from Preston's mansion. As he is walking away, Leary's posters are all over Los Angeles. King returns to South Africa where he is welcomed back and is revealed to be a police detective. Also starring Dale Dickey as Mrs. Lazlo. Boseman gives a good performance as the mysterious South African man seeking vengeance, I will honest and say that I drifted in and out a couple of times with everything in-between the revenge story, but it gets your attention with the fights and violence, not a bad action thriller. Worth watching!"

" In memory of Chadwick Boseman

It was a fine performance by a great actor and it's sad that he is no longer with us. The movie itself was slow. I felt the pacing could've been faster and the fight scenes could be done better but otherwise it was entertaining. A good Netflix film given a lot them are absolute garbage.
" Nothing special in a crowded genre
",-0.3089,-0.8352,2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,"The one-man against many revenge film has become quite a robust genre of its own. Message from the King is another in a long line of Taken-style movies, this time with Chadwick Boseman playing a man from Africa who comes to the US looking for his sister. When he finds she is dead, things start to go downhill from there. There isn't much to latch onto with this film. The story is paper thin, even though they keep trying to throw more people onto this conspiracy. In reality, it was just an easy way of creating more victims for our hero, since he takes no prisoners. Even the action sequences were fairly lackluster, so I was almost bored with the movie. It was interesting to hear Boseman working on his African accent that would later be used in his performance as Black Panther, it's just a shame that they didn't give him much to do here. The character is quiet and measured in every scene, so he doesn't get a chance to show his acting talent. There were times I thought he might be bored with the movie just like me. There's still something satisfying about these revenge movies, and I can't say that Message from the King is all that bad. It just lacked something special to make it a movie worth revisiting or recommending to anyone else."

As another reviewer noticed he's an actor comparable to Denzel Washington. Maybe yes, unfortunately he hasn't had the time to prove that. My first thought was the same when I first saw him, btw. This film, Marshall, 21 Bridges, and of course Black Panther: mnany different roles and all superb acting. His passing is an irreplaceable loss for his family, for the black community and for every moviegoer and filmlover. Rest In Peace, Chadwick. Your memory never will be forgotten.

It just becomes meaningless and stupid as it goes. Not so intelligent avenger, dumb cops, the usual high profile mafia wannabes only on the dumb side of things, dull politician, no motive, too much cliche. I can go on and on. Its not worth it.Oh, it has nothing to do with any king by the way. don't be fooled by the synopsis either, hell even the promo poster. Chadwick Boseman is a good actor don't get me wrong. Love his African accent in movies. He was probably trying this flick to get somewhere in Hollywood mainstream and that's all I can assume. Hope he picks and chooses better plots since he is already at the prime time at the moment.Alright peeps, the usual, don't waste your time on this.

It's bad enough that there's not enough original thought coming out of Hollywood that they have to make so many remakes each year, but surely it's not gotten so bad that they have to plagerize lesser known, older, or foreign films that they hope people will be nonethewiser about...well, I guess it has gotten that bad when Martin Scorcese rips off Infernal Affairs.

In particular, Alfred Molina is very good as the sleazy movie producer. I also liked Teresa Palmer with her little daughter (who was great for such a young girl). Overall, the cast is excellent, as is the plot. Not an easy ride, this film; however, it's very well made, especially for a Netflix film. Undoubtedly, the director (Fabrice Du Welz) should get a lot of credit. The understated soundtrack sets the dark mood perfectly. I love the fretless bass over the closing credits, too. A must see. I want to point out Chadwick Bozeman has a very unique gift for expressing himself without speaking. There are not many actors of his quality. There are some other actors who are very understated. For example, Ryan Gosling. He is too understated. He is still very good, but he needs to stop trying to be Steve McQueen. That may sound harsh, but it's what I see. Bozeman is completely authentic.

" BRILLIANT!!! AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE FROM CHADWICK BOSEMAN IN THIS DARK SEEDY REVENGE THRILLER
",0.7488,0.9963,2019-10-15 00:00:00,9,"This extremely dark seedy Thriller is absolutely Brilliant!!!
It's a throwback back to brutal old school grimy sleazy,seedy & brutal Thrillers like ""HardCore"" & ""The Exterminator"" & ""8mm"" it's a dark & dangerous film.This shows the darker side of LA, it's full of homeless & hopeless people trying to survive it's grim grip, this really captures the gritty realism of the ""Real Los Angeles"" that exists just below the surface of the phoney ""Glitz and glamour"" we mostly see!!!Chadwick Boseman is excellent here & gives a fantastic powerful & raw performance as the brother from Africa who comes to LA to find his sister, it's not long before he realises she was a victim of some of the evil scum that runs that dark underworld of the city of Angels.
This tense Thriller was emotional, powerful & raw, the cinematography captured the sunny but depressing reality of the city, people are just surviving & all around them is a place of decay & danger.The ""Black Panther"" Chadwick was so good in his role, he's an intense actor with a solid screen presence, the rest of the cast was all excellent but Chadwick Boseman is really fantastic here with his thick African accent that also later used for his big breakout role of Black Panther, he's great here as a strong & silent type of man on a mission. This is probably the best performance I've seen of Chadwick as it's full of fear, rage & has a rawness to it. Chadwick Boseman was one of the greatest actors of his generation, he was just getting started really, so sad we've lost a great of Cinema & a good man from the world R.I.P to one of my favourite actors.I also like i said this gritty revenge Thriller had echoes of the excellent ""8MM"" it shared some similar themes & bits of story, i liked that as i still think that 8mm is the best film Nick Cage has ever made!!!
The story is disturbing when you find out what really happened to the sister, it's really a dark film but i do love the Vigilante justice that comes later, the scum in this movie & in real life do deserve to die!!!
A brilliant brutal & bleak Thriller that is one of the most exciting & brilliantly made films I've seen lately, An intense revenge Thriller. One of the best Gritty Crime Thriller's in years!!!"

" A message back to the King. Your movie is as dull as dishwater.
",-0.4019,-0.8557,2018-09-14 00:00:00,4,"Message from the KingThis Netflix original movie starring Chadwick Boseman is a strange movie.
Strange because despite some decent performances and well crafted cinematography this movie still manages to fail to engage its audience.
Message from the King is a boring and tedious film.
A movie that starts out very promising, it soon descends into a real snooze fest.
The story tells of Jacob King (Boseman) who receives a distressing telephone call from his sister. She resides in America and is clearly in serious trouble.
King makes the trip from South Africa to the U.S to aid is ill fated sibling.
From the trailer of this movie it is perceived that we will be getting a gritty hard edged action thriller.
Unfortunately in reality what we get is a uninteresting drama that
never really ignites.
Director Fabrice du Welz has at least managed to capture the seedy, grimy underworld of Los Angeles.
His film drips with perspiration and feels uncomfortable to watch.
Message from the King is no fun. 
The action is banal and sparse. Dialogue and drama is delivered expertly by a seasoned cast but nothing in this movie is memorable.
I'm reviewing this film twenty four hours after watching it and I can't tell you anything about the characters or what happens in the story.
It's an instantly forgettable experience.Chadwick Boseman is clearly a charismatic star of the future but here he is unable to shine because this movie is so dull.
A film I just can't recommend."

However, some things leave you confused. Firstly, the main character's sister is tortured, beaten and murdered, and you never really find out why this overkill. You do find out why the bad guys want her out of the way, but not why the hatred with which she was killed (which the killers were specifically instructed to do).
Secondly, there are numerous bad guys (the dentist gangster, the movie producer, the local hoods, the politician), and you don't fully find out who is working for who.
Thirdly, the ""rescue"" of Armande, and him running away, leaves you with a ""what? What happened? Is that it?"" feeling.
It seems like the filmmakers tried to have a shocking reveal similar to 8mm, but in my opinion they failed to deliver. The actions scenes are quite good though. I give it a 6/10."
" An unimportant ""message""
",-0.3182,0.7491,2018-03-17 00:00:00,3,"There's nothing really wrong with the premise of ""Message from the King"", that being about one man's quest to avenge the death of his sister. Yes, it's been done many times before, but with some imaginative direction and a sprinkling of a few fresh elements, it could very well have worked again. However, the actual end results are less than enthralling. The telling of this particular rehash does have in its favor the fact that it plays out in a more realistic manner than other tellings. There is also a seedy and gritty feeling that is appropriate for this premise and setting. But all this does not make up for the fact that the movie plays out in a way that is quite frankly slow, uninvolving, and downright boring at times. It's far too talkative, and seems to be spinning its wheels frequently. There also isn't that much action, and the direction of these few action sequences fails to boost the energy level at best, and is downright incompetent at its worst. Around the few action sequences, the movie is equally badly directed, with the camera zoomed in so close to the actors more often that not that you'll get a strong claustrophobia feeling. In the end, the movie doesn't even qualify as rainy day viewing, so I say skip it."

Chadwick is the stranger who comes into town - in search for his sister and his nephew.Now you can imagine that he won't just find them the minute he comes over. What he does find is some friends and quite some trouble. With an interesting choice in ""weapon"" he goes on to find out what happened. Now if you are a pacifist, you may not like how he approaches certain individuals or how he revolves arguments or how he achieves getting information from certain individuals. But this is a movie and a certain motivation plus determination will lead to a violent resolution. Question is: how well is it made? I'd say more than decent enough. It doesn't add anything really new to the genre, but it is well executed (if you'll excuse the pun) ..."

I decided to give it a go though and I'm glad I did. I wouldn't say I loved it but it was a very solid and enjoyable film for the most part. There was adequate violence and the action/fight sequences were well executed and fun to watch. The characters are a large part of what make this film so good. Both the hero and the main villain are well created characters and well cast also. Chadwick Boseman in particular impressed me. He brought a terrific intensity to the film and definitely had you rooting for him and caring about the fate of his character. On that note, this is a very dark film. I can't remember one single piece of comedic relief in the entire run time. It's not a film I can see anyone being blown away by, but it's also a film I couldn't imagine anyone not enjoying."
" Like John Wick, only better

I could explain why, but I'll just stick to telling you who this movie is for so you can decide on your own.First of all this movie is made for people that enjoy a nice action movie and don't really care about the plot.
At the same time though, it's made for those that love strong emotions, even when they're not romantic ones XD.
But be aware, this movie isn't always violent, but when it is, it's pretty gross, which - in my opinion - is the beauty of it, but you may think differently.All in all I think this movie is a good one, although the side characters and antagonists are all one-dimensional, but then again, if that's not what you're looking for, you're pretty well served."

" The part of America you don't even want to admit exists
",0.1476,-0.7676,2017-12-01 00:00:00,1,"I knew I wasn't going to like this film. I watched it ONLY because I think Chadwick Boseman is one of the best actors to come along in decades. And, I was right. It's an awful film, filmed with truly excessive violence, and representing the part of America we all know exists in the darkest corners of some cities, and is every bit as depraved as the worst of cities in the Third World (and yes, I lived in the Third World for a while).Boseman may be the perfect actor. When you go to one of his films, you don't see Boseman; you see the character he's playing.The rest of the cast here...well, I don't think anyone comes off very well here, particularly Alfred Molina; he must be very hard up for work.I realize some like this. Personally, although I have no problem with violence or sex in a film, my take on this film -- perverted trash. It cost $10 million to make and took in only about $250,000. What a disaster. To Chadwick Boseman: You inspired us in ""42"". You were phenomenal is ""Get On Up"" (about a type of music I don't even like). You were totally impressive in ""Marshall"". I'm expecting great things in ""Black Panther"". Hopefully this is your low spot...because it can't get much lower than this. What were you thinking?"

You told me Bianca was not a problem anymore. Bianca isn't a problem anymore. I'm afraid that's his problem.""Those who imagine the Los Angeles metropolis to be idealistically beautiful, they should adjust that view after watching ""Message from the King"". The less beautiful part of Los Angeles is used here. An impoverished neighborhood where the vast majority of residents live in poverty and where crime and drugs are an obvious part of society. Ash gray ghettos full of human suffering. And that's being emphasized by drizzly weather. The crowded mortuary is a reflection of these fading slums. A collection of nobodies who died because of an overdose, madness (drowned in a bathtub as an imaginary fish) and gang violence.This is what Jacob King (Chadwick Boseman) faces when he arrives in L.A. The reason why he's staying in the city of angels is the sudden disappearance of his younger sister Bianca (Sibongile Mlambo). Soon he discovers the sore situation his sister got herself into and what it did to her : she earned a spot in the mortuary with a name tag on her big toe. The search for the murderers of his younger sister brings him in touch with all kind of figures. Trish (Natalie Martinez) the loyal neighbor points him in the right direction after which he meets a violent gang of Balkan criminals run by a certain Zico (Lucan Melkonian). Then there's the rich dentist Wentworth (Luke Evans) and the wealthy movie producer Preston (Alfred Molina). And let me tell you. Some of them are getting to know the bicycle chain he just bought, in a less pleasant way.For Jacob, these L.A. neighborhoods probably still look like charming neighborhoods compared to where he comes from. His sister Bianca, his deceased brother Isaac and Jacob himself, lived the largest part of their life in South Africa in the Cape Flat townships, a sandy area south of Cape Town and better known as ""Apartheid's dumping ground"". A dilapidated community where gangs rule. Both in the slums and in prison. Such as ""The Number Gangs"". Isaac was a member of this notorious gang, until his death. Reason enough for Bianca to turn her back on her home country and to seek salvation in the United States.You could say this movie is a cheaper version of ""The Equalizer"" with Boseman having an equal personality as Denzel Washington. A cold-blooded but alert person who has control over his violent eruptions and who accurately follows the traces to solve the criminal puzzle in the end. However, the ultimate motive remains quite mysterious. Perhaps the only minus I could find in this hard-core, ultra-dark movie. In fact, it's an ordinary revenge film that differs slightly from others because of its quirky atmosphere and tone. And afterwards I discovered the film was directed by a fellow countryman : Fabrice du Welz. Maybe that's why this movie displays a kind of willfulness.Even though this action-flick is soaked by clich√© elements (corrupt policemen, a cunning politician and a prostitute (Teresa ""Lights Out"" Palmer) who plays the Good Samaritan), you can speak of a stylish end product. No explicit violence scenes (the result is usually more explicit than the action itself) and a few star-like interpretations like that of Teresa Palmer. But especially Chadwick Boseman impressed. A man with few words, but hard negotiating techniques. From the very first instance, I was fascinated by him. In my opinion, this is yet again a rough diamond that simmers on Netflix undiscovered. Don't let anybody stop you from watching this when you bump into it somewhere, because this will surely surprise you.More reviews here : http://movie-freak.be"

The lighting was too dark, even if it was going for a pseudo-noir effect. The camera had trouble following the action in the fight scenes, and the director must have been asleep to let all of this take place. It started out okay, but why did he have to lie about being a cab driver, and not tell customs he was a detective? He didn't know that his sister was dead yet. Why did he only bring $600? Why couldn't he involve the LAPD if he was a detective? The second half was so convoluted, it made no sense whatsoever. Terrible movie!"

I was engaged from beginning to end - the twist is superb.You won't regret watching this movie.
" this is how you do grief
",-0.4939,0.5702,2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"i wish i could show this film to all the haters who downvoted my review of Aftermath.Message From The King is a very personal take on the revenge film genre, kind of similar to Taken, but less Hollywood. The message, to be clear, is pain.Chadwick Boseman plays King, a black man from South Africa who shows up in the US to visit his sister, who is apparently living there.You can immediately understand that while the two siblings were close, they must have had some family issues that have now prevented from keeping close still. This is done without words, just by Acting(tm).King finds his sister's roommate, and we immediately understand that something bad has happened, she must have fallen in with the wrong crowd.King, who seems to be a young man of little means, proves himself to be a spectacular investigator and soon finds out what has happened and who needs some punishment. And he does bring on the bad people a great good deal of punishment, but not in a Hollywood ""fire and brimstone"" kind of way, but rather closer to the way you had that fight in highschool and nothing went as planned but in the end you won and the other guy lost.THIS is how you do grief. THIS is how you do real in a film. Boseman puts in some real effort and the result is tangible, helped by the fantastic direction and camera-work that frame the emotions rather than the script. Message From the King is a bit limited in scope, true. Guy goes on revenge. OK, but what is remarkable is that it uses good filmmaking and acting techniques to advance the story, instead of ""good guy dodges bullets, bad guy's car explodes"", which is, in my opinion, the reason why the rating is so low.Watch this film. If you don't like it, you'll know exactly what type of movie-goer you are.My vote: a solid 7.5/10 and hopefully we'll see more of Boseman."

Which leaves you like mmmm OK and then your back to where you thought the story was going. Now my issues, the accent was too strong or low. Which stopped certain scenes from connecting. Also I'm not going to lie a car chase scene and some one liners would have made it Fire. And the action needed more multi angles (point of view shots). But this would add 1000s to budget and editing time. Modern film making is control by numbers, like most products today. So, I am not disappointed and I cant wait for this teams next project.Apart from that very good watch. Casting and performances were strong. If you like films like taken with a touch of born identity. Then this is the Netflix title for you. One the best crime action dramas on Netflix today."

Message From The King is the logical step further in his directing career. Boseman was good, I imagine he used this role to prepare for Black Panther. The accent and everything. The story's obvious and the ending predictable, but that still doesn't mean it's not worth watching. Mostly revenge flicks are poorly made. Not the case here. LA as a monster city might be hell on earth by any North American definition, but I imagine Cape Town (especially Cape Flats) to be actual hell. Now that would've been an interesting movie. One about where King's actually from. Where HE lives (or survives) each day.Actually pretty good flick.

Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had none.Unlikely.This movie left me with a lot of questions, but before we get to that I want to say some of the things I enjoyed.A story with black characters not based on traditional stereotypes! That I know of anyway. I'm not South African. The siblings tattoo idea. I like the symbolism (intended or not) of how each sibling ends up seeing, hearing, or speaking evil. Great cast overall. Would not change the chemistry. The use of a bike chain as a weapon. The good guy didn't really win, and probably made certain characters lives worse. I'm a bit torn though as well because we're still seeing more whites 'win' than black in movies...so as much as I like the end, it was bittersweet.Armand. For some reason he turned into my favorite character even though he had no lines.That being said...The story did not seem to know how it wanted to tell itself. There were several . I don't know if this was writer or director error, or if it was intentional, but the lack of certain realism pulled me from the movie and kept me from my usual suspension of reality.First: The border security...like what? He got let into the country after not answering any questions? He got moved to an interrogation room and wasn't finger printed? They would have known he was a detective. I don't understand his need to lie about this. There is no motive. Did he pay someone off to fake his identity? ""I am here to visit my sister. I will be staying with her and using the money for food and bus fare. In a week, I will return home."" or even ""I wanted to see if busking in your country would garner the same results as your young Americans do in my country."" would have made more sense.Second: Hinting a little at why he calls himself The King would have been nice. It was a great line and wish it had been explored more.Third: How did he not get arrested when he beat up Frankie? The sirens were close. The drugs were mostly used up. I'm sure since it was outside no one else would have been an issue even if they were high because of lack of possession.Third p2: How on Earth were the cops who arrested him worth 50 grand? They were so bad at their side job. Cops not on the books are violent against blacks in the States. And why the political connection in the story at all? The governor didn't seem to have anything to do with the recording and the dentist was rich enough.Fourth: If you suspect your business partner in crime is stealing from you...WHY ARE YOU NOT INVESTIGATING? Would it not make more sense to have him followed? And have someone do an independent audit? If he's done it before WHY ARE YOU STILL PARTNERS? And what rings other than drugs were they even in? It seemed like there was only one child molesting (+worse) incident and the rest were prostitutes. Were they trying to break into the underage ring? I don't get it.Fifth: What was it about the video and Armand that condemned King's sister to death? Why was she tortured instead of just executed? How was she a threat? To whom was she a threat? They hired professionals for this, why? I felt like sentences were being cut out of a book and pasted together with good inventions. It was not a bad movie by far, but it had a lot missing for me to say I loved it. The potential was there...it just didn't quite make it for me."
" Hidden Among the Rags (of LA) comes a Beauty of Cinematic Excellence
",0.836,0.9899,2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"This movie shows you what cinema should look like. This old craft of making movies with tempo, cinematography, editing and score is deprived of all imprints of judgement, opinion or the director's indulging in his pretentious personality as many directors strive to do these days; it seems that the director has nothing to prove but only the commitment to telling a beautiful masterful story filmed with excellence and craftsmanship. The goal here is to learn what real cinema is. Everything serves the story, everything is well balanced. It's an exercise in genre and a director's pure intentions to making only cinema. You don't get pitiful emotion or euphoric fake bliss you only marvel in excellence. No shot is overrated, no emotion is fake. This is a work of a master. And these days masters are found in Europe. It brought me back to my film school days when I was in awe with the great directors of past and how they can create a work of art without the excesses of today's cinematic work that is riddled with uselessness and has no soul or beauty. Mind you, this is not a masterpiece, far from it; rather this is a lesson of what true cinema is... Watch it and be in awe..."
" The King Deserves Better.
",0.4404,0.9165,2017-08-05 00:00:00,4,"When it comes to films with black leads, I try to never let representation cloud my judgement and always hope they have the ideal writing and direction working for the leads in their favor. I've been excited to see Chadwick Boseman raise from the TV show Lincoln Heights to playing T'Challa as Black Panther. After learning about this film Message from the King, I thought this film would at least be a good prelude to the few months waiting for Black Panther, however, I left severely underwhelmed that the Message brings.Chadwick Boseman plays Jacob King, a man traveling back from South Africa to search for his sister Bianca had gone missing and goes on a chase through those she knew personally for answers of her whereabouts and even resulting in violent acts in the process. Chadwick himself does fine in the role, as most of the time he is spent stoic and a man of few words. Luke Evans makes a surprise role connected to the antagonists, and while his cool persona helps the role, his character gets really annoying fast as a dentist where literally no character doesn't talk about their teeth while their around him. ""You can really learn about a man when you see his teeth."" That is a real line. In a movie that's supposed to be a action thriller.Another big issue is the pacing of this movie. Even at a 103 minute runtime, it takes entirely too long for any engaging action to occur (there's only 2 action scenes in the whole movie), and the plot and writing isn't engaging enough to warrant it's slow burn storytelling. But the film really flies off the rails in the third act with the main antagonist and you find out about his shady business involving someone young, it felt disgusting and really out of place for what the films main motivation.Message from the King was one I had hope for, but I found out halfway, this wouldn't leave a good impact. The direction and writing is choppy, despite some decent performances from Chadwick and Luke. I just feel King deserved better and I'm hoping I'm right in February."
" Compelling
",0.2263,-0.9939,2017-08-05 00:00:00,8,"A well-paced and solidly written revenge thriller, pretty much a riff on Get Carter but with a nicer hero. Chadwick Boseman is a very charismatic star and his character's background is unusual for an American action film -- an ex street kid from the Cape Town gangs. The villains are deeply unpleasant and you will have no qualms about their fates. One thing I noticed is that while the underworld on display is a pretty evil one, no one appears to be racist. Given where the film is set, you might have expected King (the hero) to be the subject of some kind of racist talk, or to elicit suspicion because he is black. Not at all. Sure people often don't like him, no doubt because he is beating them up or threatening them or their livelihood, but they display no personal racist attitudes.I would have liked to have seen more of King in Cape Town."
" Solid revenge thriller
",-0.34,0.7602,2017-08-05 00:00:00,8,"The story is nothing really special. Guy comes to LA to look for his sister and he gets tangled in the mess that she was in. He uses his tough South African skills to punish people. Liam Neeson did it with great success, Chadwick Boseman does it too.It was the acting that was pretty decent, though, as well as the portrait of the city as a corrupt place that feeds on hope and takes it all away. The ""message from the king"" is that you may have a lot of money and live in a big rich place and still be just as rotten as the most crime ridden places in Africa.Bottom line: a linear and predictable story that only highlighted the good acting and subtle message on the background."
" Average Crime Thriller
",-0.4767,0.2774,2017-08-04 00:00:00,6,"This crime thriller/revenge action film is a straightforward story about a guy from South Africa who comes to LA to find his sister, only to learn that she was viciously beaten and murdered. He spends the rest of the film tracking down her murderers and learning why she was killed. He's easy to sympathize with; you will care about this man and what he's going through. The plot is steady and things are slowly revealed, enough to keep your interest. There is not a big plot twist at the end like some reviews have (for some reason) hinted at. Quite a bit of violence, but nothing gratuitous; it makes sense within the plot.In sum, this film has good acting, it's a decent story, and it has a plot steady enough to keep your attention. Perfect for Netflix and chill."
" A good and well deserved ""message from the king""
",0.6124,0.9421,2017-08-04 00:00:00,10,"""Message from the king"" have to be one of the best payback movies ever made. This movie reminds me a little of ""Man on fire"" and ""Drive"". Its a dark thriller and shows LA in a way none else does. The story line is absolutely magnificent and the acting as well. This is a movie that deserves a much better rating and meta score. If you are looking for a good thriller/action movie.....this is absolutely one to watch!!"
" Critics need to get their cranium checked
",-0.296,0.5313,2017-08-04 00:00:00,10,"First of all, what a movie! When I heard about this movie through the cinematographer's page here on IMDb (fits perfectly with the story), I was shocked to see the 6,4 rating and the critic reviews. Chadwick Boseman shines as Jacob King, a mysterious man from Cape Town looking for his sister in Los Angeles. Director Fabrice Du Welz made good use of the locations to show us the gritty side of the city. The performance of the supporting cast is excellent for this kind of movie. For the critics who wrote their thoughts on this movie, I say this: I do not know what your problems are with this movie, but I do not see any problem with this movie. You should probably give this movie another go.For the ones you who are going to watch this on Netflix at home, be shocked for the ending."
" Film Reviews: Message From The King
",0.0,0.997,2017-02-09 00:00:00,7,"It is becoming a recent trend on the silver screen that, the city of Angels, is quickly becoming the city of demons. With this entry, showcasing a very dark, gritty and neon-lit Los Angeles, inhabited by the worst of the worst, director Fabrice Du Welz's newest follows in the deep and imprinting footsteps of Drive, yet Message From The King is a very simple, revenge-thriller homage, giving tribute to the films it was inspired by in the 80's. Mixing the neo-noir elements of film with minimalistic action sequences that make for a solid film and overall enjoyable first screening for TIFF16, Du Welz's highly stylized actioner is one captivating thrill ride.As the film begins, we aren't really given any real introduction to our protagonist. Mysterious, quiet and observant, Jacob King (Chadwick Boseman) arrives in Los Angeles like almost anyone else, looking for something. Yet, unlike the many eager young people searching the streets of Los Angeles for fame and fortune, Jacob is just looking for his younger, beautiful sister Bianca (Sibongile Mlambo), who, in fact, came to Los Angeles for the fame and fortune dream. Unfortunately, Bianca's beauty attracted the wrong crowd of people, and Bianci soon found herself at the tail end of the needle, which lead her buried in the garbage in a nearby dumpster. Jacob, upon arrival, soon learns of Bianca's death at a nearby morgue. Shaken and saddened, and with the help of Bianca's druggie neighbour Trish (Natalie Martinez), Jacob begins a decent of vengeance in the primal criminal underworld of Los Angeles.Message from the King is an interesting film, in the grand scheme surrounding its star, Chadwick Boseman. Boseman, who was recently cast as the Black Panter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, is really given a fine opportunity to prove his action chops with this film. Luckily, Boseman doesn't disappoint, even while being able to practice his South African accent, using the same coach he's been using for his upcoming standalone Black Panter film being directed by the supremely young and talented filmmaker Ryan Coogler. Boseman, who adapts more of a brooding Clint Eastwood like hero, the stranger from afar, who comes to a local town to wreck havoc of justice and morality, taking down anything and anyone in his way.Apart from having a stellar cast with the likes of Teresa Palmer as the unsuspecting helpful neighbour Kelly, to the shady dentist Dr. Wentworth, played excellently by the square-jawwed Luke Evans, to a small role for Tom Felton, playing Bianca and Trish's drug dealer Frankie, to the always impressive Alfred Molina playing the super rich and super sketchy movie producer Preston, Du Welz assembles a cast of very high caliber, delivering an action-thriller piece with many motives, intricate pieces and endless conspiracies.One of the most exciting elements of the revenge-thriler genre, especially new films placed within this very rich and lasting cannon, is finding out what exactly the protagonist's weapon of choice is going to be. Du Welz along with his screenwriters Stephen Cornwall and Oliver Butcher, decide for Mr.King, nothing other than a bike chain. Yup, you heard me right, a damn bike chain. The same kind of chain that used to dirty your hands when the chain found itself off the gears of your bicycle, Mr.King walks through the front door of all the baddies hideouts with nothing other than a bike chain, while everyone else is armed with knives, guns and clubs, King avenges his sister's death by chaining each and everyone of these generic baddies to a pulp. One of the most memorable baddies in the film, Zico (Lucan Melkonian), who, after a first encounter with Mr.King, goes to Dr.Wentworth for some reconstructive jaw surgery, dawns a clear face mask, which makes Zico's fight sequences with Jacob all the more terrifying, exciting and monster-esque.While many came out of the World Premiere of Message From the King with a very Blade Runner nostalgic feeling, I couldn't help but see the very unarguable similarities to Refn's Drive, a brooding, atmospheric action piece that is much revenge-thriller, as it is character study. While both protagonists in both these films are given less than expected back-stories, it does become clear that love is the greatest motivation for vengeance.As King comes to the end of his onslaught of revenge for his sisters death, there is a very skeptical tone in the film, where the audience questions Jacob's keen investigating, combat and sneaking skills, especially when King answers that he is a taxi driver in the opening frames of the film, during the customs interrogation scene. While I won't dear ruin the ending and the comprehension of King's skills, Du Welz does a fantastic job of engaging the audiences in all the triumphs and pitfalls of King's journey, despite some absorbingly disturbing revelations.While Message From The King isn't a perfect film, audiences can be sure to understand that each and every one of the characters presented surely have all their own agendas planned. Some of them, in pursuit of wealth, others, in pursuit of power, while Jacob and Kelly are only after what's deserving of the people who showed Bianca an early funeral and an overall better life and peace amongst themselves."
