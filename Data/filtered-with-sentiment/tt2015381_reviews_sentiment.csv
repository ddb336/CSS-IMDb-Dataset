" There's 2 hours I'll never get back
",0.0,-0.3909,2021-03-28 00:00:00,4,"I admit I don't care for these types of films, as I prefer reality based scares from giallos, action from James Bond series. I was at a friend's place and he convinced me to give it a try. I have seen 4 marvel films now, 3 of which I will never watch again, unless I don't have a freshly painted Wall to watch cure. Not sure who these are really geared for. I got the 80's references being born in early 80's, but I just find these films are tedious, flash over substance, with no character development time fillers."
" I AM Amazed
",0.4939,0.9863,2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a pleasantly surprising SyFy thriller for this generation. The film stars Chris Pratt as Peter aka Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot, and Dave Bautista as Drax. This all-star cast does an amazing job bringing these characters to life. If you like any of the Marvel Avengers movies you will love the humor and action of this family-friendly film.
Peter is a human from planet Earth that has a bounty on his head when Rocket, a talking raccoon that was developed in a lab, and Grout a walking tree come along and try to capture him to collect the bounty on him. In the meantime, Gamora comes along trying to steal the Orb that Peter has in his possession. This group of misfits that end up crossing paths, all at the same time, end up being put into prison where they meet Drax. Drax lost his family at the hands of Gamora's gang, therefore Drax wants revenge and to kill her. This group of enemies ends up having to rely on each other to escape prison. In the beginning, they are trying to kill one another or use each other for personal gain. In order to ensure their personal gain, they end up having to try and keep one another alive. By protecting each other they begin to create a bond.
I feel that the music along with the special effects that were used for this film is what makes it great. The music speaks to what is happening in the film and the emotions that the character is feeling at that time. They were consistent and the use of the music shows the time frame in which Peter left Earth.
The differences in the feeling during the scenes are also shown in the lighting and special effects. The lighting and special effects during the fight scenes show quicker cuts, as opposed to the times during the film when the characters are more relaxed, in which the director pans across the scene moving with the characters.
The director and the all-star cast pull the audience in and do an excellent job bringing the characters to life while leaving them asking what could be next for this group of friends. If you like humor in your SyFy films you will love this cinematic sensation."
" LITERALLY ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES YOU CAN FIND
",0.5574,0.9832,2021-03-19 00:00:00,9,"I had no idea Marvel movies can be so funny! Action and comedy are actually pretty nice combined. The characters are just brilliant and the jokes are just like they should be, not too lame but not too much. The story was very good and entertaining. The only reason I don't rate this 10/10 is because Guardians Of the Galaxy vol 2 is just a bit better. I highly recommend watching this, even if you thought that Marvel movies are boring (like I did)."
" my opinion
",0.0,0.8833,2021-03-18 00:00:00,8,A very beautiful visual effects movie .. but its sensuality is closer to cartoon films .. I hope the rest of the parts will be better.
" An obvious flawless scifi comedy comic book MASTERPIECE!!! Top 10 best EVER!!
",0.9572,0.9785,2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Nothing I can add to this amazing work of art, to me no scifi compares, it blows away star wars...sorry!! The cast is magical, the story phenomenal, the special effects and the 3d un paralleled, this will become a classic film right at the top!! The comedy is mixed in perfectly, we've watched this film at least 20 times, 3 times in the theater and the rest at home in brilliant 3d bluray!!! It gets better everytime we see it. Thank you to the cast and crew for a huge feel good , lose yourself for 2 hours work of art!!!!!"
" Impressive
",0.5106,0.9698,2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"I didn't know anything as all about this movie or the characters so it all came as a fantastic surprise.
The thing that impressed me the most is the universe of superheroes is pretty crowded now but somehow they made these characters work, made them interesting and made them feel necessary.Dripping with creativity and quality characters that have some depth and some flaws we can sink our viewing teeth into.Tremendous movie fun :)"
" James Gunn, a crazy genius.
",-0.34,0.8329,2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"I honestly believe Guardians of the Galaxy would never have worked without James Gunn. I have to reluctantly admit that Joss Whedon put it the best when he said: ""James Gunn is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart.""The casting was fantastic. Each of the major actors fit their roles like a glove.And it's another example of how music elevates a movie. GoG is he first MCU movie to actually have real songs (nostalgic 70's music) played throughout, setting the tone in the first 30 seconds with the melancholic I'm Not In Love by 10CC.But what really sets this apart from all the others MCU movies before this is the mastery of the humor. I think this is the first Marvel movie that I busted my gut a bazillion times while watching. Nearly everything that comes out of Drax's mouth and so many quotable quotes it would fill up a cassette tape.It is so apropos that James Gunn was tapped to reboot Suicide Squad. I hope his R rated version kills at the box office and makes Kevin Feige reconsider his stupid ""only PG-13"" for MCU movies (except Deadpool 3) rule.""We are Groot."""

" FUNNY, FULL OF HEART AND VISUALLY DAZZLING

" An enjoyable movie with visual effects but not good (6.0)
",-0.2867,0.9162,2021-01-28 00:00:00,6,"I can actually say I don't like it, but of course, it's enjoyable to watch. Why? because an adventure in space has great scenes decorated with visual effects, incredible makeup, and costumes.I always say it is enjoyable to watch, but I think it is not a good movie, there are too many events to be told and to fit it in 2 hours it's too hard. So I shouldn't criticize all the nonsense because it has a more complex and broad scenario than other marvel movies just like Thor.I obviously didn't like most of the action scenes, it seemed simple to me, the effects are great but the one-on-one fight scenes did not satisfy me. Especially I found the prison break scenes very simple, I did not understand how the crew was quickly uniting and trusting each other but of course, it could be because the movie is 2 hours long and they want to get to the main topic quickly.Finally, I think this movie was a transition movie. They will bring marvel characters like Iron Man and Captain America living around the world to the galaxies and I think a movie enough for the transition was just my expectation, I didn't like it."
" Good movie from the MCU
",0.4404,0.9081,2021-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 1 is a 2014 Sci Fi Action Comedy starring Chris Pratt,Zoe Salvada,John C Reily and Glenn Close featuribg the voices of Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon and Vin Diesel as Groot. A young boy named Peter is taken from Earth in 1988 by terriestrials and ends up helping the mutants 26 years later with a talking raccoon(Cooper),a tree that's say Groot(Diesel),and an alien/woman with green skin(Saldana) to save mankind from Thanos(Broslin).This movie is very fast paced and sorta hard to follow but kudos to the visuals and special effects."
" There is a lot to like
",0.3612,0.9971,2021-01-18 00:00:00,9,"When planning how I was going watch all these MCU films, this is one I earmarked as being one I thought I'd enjoy - not based on anything of note, I knew very little, but from the passing screenshots and such I had seen it seemed like one I'd enjoy. I'm happy to say I certainly did!'Guardians of the Galaxy' is so enjoyable. It's 121 minutes of pure entertainment. It does, at least to me, have a different feel to it when compared to the nine preceding MCU films. That's not a negative for either this or those earlier productions, it just felt different to me.I particularly enjoyed the cast, which features - as is customary at this point - a load of well known names. Chris Pratt is, probably, the perfect choice for Peter, he carries the role extremely well - his humour sticks out, but he also performs the more serious stuff nicely.Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Michael Rooker are all thoroughly enjoyable too. Vin Diesel (kinda?) appears to portray Groot, which pleases me as someone who is a big fan of 'Fast & Furious'. There are a few others in there, including Djimon Hounsou and Benicio del Toro. Terrific cast!There is a lot to like here. I look forward to seeing the follow-ups to it."

" Perfect soundtrack
",0.5719,0.1751,2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,"First of all: the person who came up with the movie soundtrack was a genius, nobody can deny that.Guardians of the Galaxy is something of a cult classic that everyone needs to see at least once. If this movie doesn't make you laugh and/or cry, something is wrong with you (We are Groot was a very emotional moment).Sure, the film contains a lot of action and special effects, but it is also a heart-warming tale of friendship, overcoming obstacles and doing good, despite not being perfect. The Guardians of the Galaxy aren't your typical heroes and that is what makes them so likeable.I don't like action movies, nor superhero or space movies - the movie was all of these things and I still recommend it."
" What a wonderful movie 10/10
",0.5719,0.999,2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"Guardians of the Galaxy touched my heart. Both movies are exceptional in their own way. They're apart from marvel superhero movies. What I mean is even if it wasn't a marvel movie I'd recommend that to everybody who loves to have a good time while watching a movie of that quality. At first I was skeptical about superhero movies with galaxy adventures, but when I was forced to watch it to prepare for avenger movies I was surprised. It catches you from the first seconds when Quill starts to dance to the the classical pop hit ' come and get your love '.Usually it's my habit to talk about the cinematography and the acting which was a great experience. A very quality motion picture movie. The plot is so magical all of them have so much in common and you feel for them cause all of them had calamities. The character developing is wonderful. I don't wanna spoil to much so I don't go farther into detail.A little note for my personal self: I'm also happy for Dave Bautista, cause I grew up as a teenager watching him at WWE. To see him breakthrough with this role is amazing. I'm so proud of him. He fits his role so perfect.The plot is awesome and entertaining and never loses its pace. It also connects directly to the following big movies ( if you know what I mean ).Can't tell anything bad about the costumes and makeup or shall I say makeover ?! So good !!The music is totally my taste. I love different kind of musics and I grew up with pop and rock. So to see them bring up some classic pop hits back is wonderful. It automatically puts you onto a positive vibe. That's my experience. Always got love for these kinda movies. I watched both movies for the second time yesterday. I had a feeling to share a review cause this movie deserves more awards and appreciation. I wish they had won an Oscar for at least one category like cinematography, costumes or best soundtrack.I can't wait for Volume III !"

" Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) Review - 8.7/10
",0.0,0.9402,2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the funniest, well-written movies in the entirety of the MCU. Chris Pratt is amazing, as always, and the rest of the cast is not to be slept on. Even the professional wrestler, Dave Bautista was great in his role as Drax the Destroyer! This film was excellently casted, wonderfully acted, and let's not forget that score. One downfall is the villain, Ronan, but that's not enough to ruin this film. For Christ's sake this movie made me cry because a tree said ""We are Groot!"" That should tell you why this film is so beloved."
" Great space adventure
",0.7506,0.9851,2020-11-16 00:00:00,8,"Good lord, I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. Where as I usually prefer the more mature and serious MCU movies, this is a wonderful exception. It's funny, it's lighthearted and it's imaginative. That does not mean it's lacking good characters. Each of the Guardians have their own struggles and quirks, while also being very likeable and funny. The best scenes in the movie are the ones where the characters just talk, which shows just how good the chemistry between them are. The plot is fairly simple, yet engaging, and the pacing is really good. The action is well made, the emotional moments are good, the climax feels pretty climactic. I do have a few issues though. Firstly, while the villain seems to have a reason for his actions, he's still very one-dimentional and boring thematically. I also got a little tired of the ""end of the world"" trope which seems to be in most superhero films these days, even though this movie handled it better than most other movies I've seen it in. The comedy was also a little too silly for my liking, but it wasn't a big deal. These flaws don'r ruin the movie in the slighest though, as this is a fun, exciting and engaging experience that I highly recommend."

Everything after ""we are Groot"" works wonderfully. The dance-off, the holding hands moment, the montage and, best of all, Peter opening his mother's present. That will always be my favorite part of the whole movie."
" In My Opinion, The Best Non-Avengers MCU Movie
",0.6369,0.999,2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"I adore this movie so much! I have no idea how Marvel did it. They turned a group of D-list superheroes to some of the most popular and loved characters in the MCU but also created one of the funniest but also heartfelt MCU movies.What an achievement. This movie is just the perfect mix of everything. The CGI is excellent and while there is a lot, it doesn't feel too over saturated and pretty easy to follow what is going on and that is an accomplishment. The action sequences are all so much fun, so exciting, so fast paced and despite the fact there's a lot going on, it's pretty easy to follow. The soundtrack is stellar. I did not grow up with these songs but I love them. They are so catchy and always uses during the best times, during a montage or the movie's funnier moments.I adore the characters as well. They have so much personality, are hilarious and I love their character dynamics and interactions. It feels really well developed and every actor brings so much energy to the role and this movie is hilarious. It's the first MCU movie to go full comedy and it mostly lands.Despite the hilarious moments, this movie is really emotional. I literally cried during the opening scene and the scene where the Guardians hold the power stone or the scene where Star Lord reads his late mom's letter or the scene where the Guardians decide to fight Ronan are all very emotional scenes that get blended in with the comedy perfectly."

Definitely a must watch even if you aren't a superhero movie lover.
" Great film worth watching.
",0.7184,0.9294,2020-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a great film by fantastic director James Gunn that tells the tale of Peter Quill, or Star-Lord as he likes to call himself, and hos band of misfits Rocket, Groot, Gamora and Drax as they make their way from plan to plan, ending up in the clutches of the Ravagers, a high security NOVA prison and ultimately squaring off against a powerful Kree warlord who wants nothing but control and destruction. The excellent cinematography combined with a star-studded cast make this an engaging film that threads the line between explosions and emotional conflicts that will win your heart over, if Rocket's hilarious outbursts or Drax's literal personality havent done so already. My only gripes with the film come from odd holes in the plot such as Rocket and Groot going from wanting to turn Peter into the authorities for a handsome sum of units to risking their lives with him on a dangerous suicide mission or the sudden attitude change for the main characters as they go from wanting to kill each other to being ""best friends"". My assumption is that Gunn was restricted by the length of the film, but nonetheless it does make for a slightly jarring jump in character development. Well worth a watch and helps provide context to the greater arc in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
" Guardians Of The Galaxy
",0.0,0.9993,2020-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is just a pure fun sci-fi summer blockbuster that blindsided many people when it came out. Not many people expected it to have the success that it did mostly due to the fact that these characters were very obscure in Marvel lore. That obscurity gave the writers a chance to introduce for the first time on the silver screen five really relatable characters to root for, each with their own arc. The fun loving and bumbling Star Lord is a character who was abducted from earth and raised by a bunch of outcasts. At first, he like another Guardian was only in it for the money. However the film has him Bond with the others and begin to see that the value of life is more important. Gamora is the daughter of the Mad Titan Thanos who is only interested in stopping Ronan and her father from using the power stone to cause harm. Throughout the film she is a loner but her arc mostly revolves around learning to work with others. Rocket is not a raccoon to himself but we'll call him that. He was in it for the money and had no interest towards bonding with others. His character was the most interesting from this film, he was the last to join the group in the climatic battle and arguably he was the most stubborn. His arc not just centered around trying to learn the value in working with others but actually befriending them as well. His partner Groot loved people and by the way he is Groot. Groot's arc perfectly coincided with Rocket's in that he wanted Rocket to help others and was willing to make sacrifices to ensure that Rocket would. Groot's place in the Guardians created the emotional epicenter of the film. Drax, the last of the Guardians was a killer on a path to avenge the death of his wife and family. However after crossing paths with the other Guardians, needed to learn to work with them and not allow his grudge to get him killed. These are all five simple arcs that sum up the plot as a group of misfits trying to work with each other to stop a madman from using a power to conquer a world. Not an unfamiliar plot at all but the writing used to make the Guardians such realistic characters really helped make it feel fresh. Unfortunately that writing didn't save Ronan the accuser from being a pretty bland nothing of a villain. Roman's arc wasn't about anything other than being hungry for power over the Xandarians. No reasons why aside from the fact that they called him crazy this one time. Despite this though, this film is a summer blockbuster so I can forgive a slightly formulaic plot and bland villain based on the kind of movie this is. This movie is pure fun whether it's Star Lord dancing to ""Come And Get Your Love"" in the opening credits, to Rocket having Star Lord steal some guy's leg as a prank, to Yondu using his arrow to annihilate Roman's soldiers, and Star Lord challenging Ronan to a dance off just as he's about to commit global genocide. There are so many notable moments, sequences and songs in this film and if I'm being honest, this film has the best soundtrack of any Marvel film to date. Yes, there's some generic score music but the writers very much have you more keyed in on Star Lord's Walkman sound track. ""Ooh Child"", ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", and ""Hooked On A Feeling"" are just a few classics the film throws at you in creative ways to. For example, ""Hooked On A Feeling"" plays as Star Lord is being sprayed with a hose and you get to see... Those abs... Oh my. ANYWAYS, speaking of seeing things, the visual effects were very impressive, especially for the characters of Rocket and Groot. Rocket Raccoon looked like a real raccoon that could pick up a gun and blow somebody's fuckin' head off. Groot looked like a real sentient tree that smiled after annihilating an entire wave of Ronan goons. I think what really keeps this film going are the performances, even though Chris Pratt played himself. Is that a bad thing? No, the man is incredibly funny and did a great job, especially when the Guardians held hands at the climatic sequence. The other Guardians were unrecognizable as their alien characters. Actually I take that back, I can recognize Vin Diesel's mumbling anywhere but aside from him my statement stays the same. Bradley Cooper as Rocket in particular blew me away as I didn't know he had such a great range as an actor. From country singer to a bipolar eagle's fan to a talking raccoon, is there anything that man can't do? On a side note by the way, I loved Benicio Del Toro as the collector, he was unhinged as hell. I honestly wished he played a bigger role in the grand scheme of the MCU but to each their own I guess. Last but not least, the pacing was pretty solid as well. You could say that there were some scenes that may not have seemed to be needed in the film but I would be willing to counteract by saying that it is those scenes that help build the Guardians character. At the end of the day, Guardians Of The Galaxy is a fun summer sci-fi adventure that does lack a compelling villain and contain a few formulaic plot elements but it also has enough going for it for me to say it is one of the better Marvel movies to watch. While it wasn't as fresh as The Winter Soldier was, it certainly was just as fun. I'm gonna give the Guardians Of The Galaxy a 7 out of 10. I had twelve percent of a plan for writing this review."

" Immy's review : A classic
",0.0,0.995,2020-08-19 00:00:00,8,"As someone who is not a fan of Marvel nor superhero movies, I really enjoyed this film. Despite its recycled plot, what makes this stand out from the other generic movies is the loveable and refreshing characters, the killer music, and the distinct and unique design and atmosphere. The main characters were fascinatingly individual, separating themselves from the other more dull and shallow characters I've seen in superhero movies. They had a infectious and heartwarming dynamic together, which created something very moving to watch, as we witness five very different people try and get along, evoking chaos and some hilarious conflicts. The way they were introduced was genius, as what turns from them plotting against each other, turns into them teaming up and helping one another. The characters were genuinely loveable, especially the mischievous Rocket, and the sweet and selfless Groot, who you instantly fall in love with. The movie had the perfect blend of comedy and drama, knowing exactly when to throw in a joke, and not being afraid to add some lighthearted humour to the serious scenes. What's great about this movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, and almost has a satirical tone to the 'Superhero' genre. Every dramatic moment became something funny, and so the movie didn't become this overly melo-dramatic and cliche superhero film. It knew when to tone it down. That's why it worked for someone like me who can't take the superhero movies seriously. The soundtrack was legendary, providing a mix of glam rock and roll and hardcore rock, creating a fun and thrilling atmosphere, and really evoking a sense of 'epicness'. Finally, the CGI was incredibly realistic and aesthetically compelling, producing a beautiful yet distinct backdrop for the characters. Overall, this movie is a fun, witty and heartwarming experience with excellent music, effects and a genuine and heartfelt core. Highly recommend!"

Well,,, I do believe the gamble that MCU rolled the dice on has paid off more than they could've imagined!! Even RDJ said this movie was the best thing to have come out of the MCU at that point, and we're not going to argue with Ironman.

" Lot's of Pratting around in this fun sci-fi fantasy.
",0.596,0.7639,2020-08-06 00:00:00,8,"Generally speaking, I'm fan of Chris Pratt and here he is thoroughly entertaining as the ""Star Lord - Peter Quill"", a sort of inter-galactic treasure hunter who is challenged to track down an orb. Once he finds and tries to sell it, his world becomes a whole lot more interesting as just about everyone from Djimon Hounsou - sporting a cracking hairdo as ""Korath"", to kick-ass Zoe Saldana ""Gamora"" and the most unlikely of duos ""Rocket"" & ""Groot""- one a racoon (Bradley Cooper), the other a walking tree with an extremely limited vocabulary (Vin Diesel) - want to snatch it from him! It soon transpires that the orb contains a source of unimaginable power that the evil ""Thanos"" and his lieutenant ""Ronan"" (Lee Pace) will stop at nothing to possess. When all these attempts to steal his artefact attract the attention of the authorities lead by an immaculately coiffured Glenn Close, they end up in a maximum security prison where they decide to join forces - alongside the deservedly named ""Drax the Destroyer"" (Dave Bautista), forcing their way out and setting off on a quest to stop the arch criminals from reducing Ms. Close's world to atoms. It's got bundles of charisma, this film - the script is witty and fast moving, the characters are easily the most interesting and developed in the ensemble Marvel-verse, and the pretty eclectic soundtrack is used properly, rather than as a substitute for the dialogue. I'm praying that it doesn't spawn a whole slew of pointless sequels and spin-offs; it's originality is an huge part of it's charm."
" Not impressed
",-0.3724,0.5574,2020-08-05 00:00:00,6,"This film has a lot of zany humour which is not really for me. What did I expect from a film with a talking raccoon and a sentient tree? It's an oddball and an outlier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, suited perhaps for those with a taste for the bizarre. For me though, it was just too scatterbrained to really connect with."
" The perfect soundtrack does exist!
",0.6114,0.967,2020-08-03 00:00:00,8,There is nothing better than Chris Pratt grooving and jamming to some classics. And at the same time saving the galaxy from its ending. The all starkest makes the movie easy to watch with some great comedy that is easy to enjoy and only adds to the greatness of the film. The story itself is also amazing and having seen the second Guardians of the Galaxy the ending where he finds out that he is not all human is the perfect set up for the next movie.
" Guardians of the Galaxy
",0.0,0.9997,2020-08-02 00:00:00,8,"Guardians of the Galaxy, directed by James Gunn, is one of the best comic book movies ever made, while also being yet another model film of the MCU. James Gunn didn't follow the MCU criteria/style, putting his own directorial hand all over the film for the better. Gunn incorporated a lot of stylistic, unorthodox shots, that just popped off the screen with the great color pallet and cinematography.Guardians of the Galaxy is a true breath of fresh air, packed in with tons of heart and soul! Because of the creativity of James Gunn, he made Guardians of the Galaxy a fantastic stand-alone film, that anyone can watch and enjoy, while still having tons of play from the past MCU films. James Gunn absolutely NAILS the tones of this film! He crafted a mainly comedy based tone, that was well balanced, taking some of the edge off of the darker phase two, while also incorporating a fantastic emotional and grounded tone. These concepts and tones could've easily been taken in the wrong direction, because of how cheesy everything looks on paper, but due to Gunn's brisk pace, and constant excitement, The Guardians of the Galaxy absolutely works! I don't know if I can technically call this a negative of the film, but I just needed more of everyone; not to say everyone was underdeveloped, there was just so much more potential with these amazing characters, I just wanted more! One of the only negatives I have to say about the story, is the fact that the premise itself isn't the most original, while setting up for expositions; other than that, James Gunn did a fantastic job having the characters move the story.The characters were the absolute selling point of the film. Marvel has this thing where they take these lowkey characters, and turn them into everyone's favorite superheroes. This perfectly imperfect cast just meshed so well together, creating amazing chemistry, and genuine tention and banter. James Gunn and the creative team did a great job with establishing each original character, giving everyone some depth, while allowing them to have a few great character moments. The creative team did the best they could fleshing everyone out, because if they tried to flesh everyone out equally, this film could've easily hit the four hour+ mark. Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Starlord, is easily the most focused character out of the bunch, but I was perfectly okay with that, because he brings so much heart, charisma, wit, charm, and humor to the character, while having a fantastic delivery to all of his lines. Even though Chris Pratt can be a little over the top, he is such an easy character to get invested in, because of his damaged back story. Chris Pratt gives a great performance, proving he can be that guy in the leading role, and why he belongs in the MCU. Zoe Saldana as Gamora also puts on a great performance! Her back story is probably the most fleshed out, and impactful to the big picture, leaving her character to be the most grounded out of them all. She brings a lot of wit to the film, while also having great layers to her character. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon is my favorite character out of this favorable bunch. For a side character, he out shines the leads on a few occasions, bringing the best sense of humor out of the whole MCU, while adding in his outside of the box wit. He compliments the group extremely well, carrying a lot of weight throughout the film. The biggest surprise of the film, was Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer! He, by far, has the best delivery of the film, bringing a tremendous amount of heart and humor to his character. Even though Drax isn't the most fleshed out character, not having a whole lot to do, you can't help but care for this guy, due to his extreme likability. With Vin Diesel as Groot, not having much to do or say at all, he just has that likability to carry him through this film with no issues. Michael Rooker as Yondu is one of the few characters that's from the comics, and he serves his purpose well. He puts on a super fun performance, carrying decent weight throughout the film. Lee Pace as Ronan tries his best, but the way his character was written, left him to be one dimensional, underdeveloped, and forgettable. I wish his character was more fleshed out because, even though he didn't have the most original motive, he had the potential to be a halfway decent villain.The screenplay by James Gunn and Nicole Perlman, was just a blast of fun! This is, without a doubt, the MCU's funniest film, with the perfect balance of cohesive jokes, that hit every single time! If they would've gave a little more to a few characters, there isn't much else that can hold this film back.The action of the film was present for a great deal of the time. Every single sequence had it's own appeal, being well crafted and shot, with almost seamless effects.The best part of this film, without any question, is the soundtrack and score. James Gunn and Tyler Bates did not need to give us this amazing 80s soundtrack, backed up with this original score, but they did... and they did that for us. Without the score and music, this is a completely different film, that just wouldn't be able to top off each scene.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy deserves to be in everyone's top 5 of the MCU! With all of the greatness this movie has, it outweighs the negatives tremendously!"

Guardians of the Galaxy cleverly mixes comedy and superhero action and makes something extremely awesome, the relationships/friendships between all of these characters feels real, and Groot, oh my god! I drew so much fan art for Groot, he is the greatest character in the entire movie and I absolutely love him. Chris Pratt also delivers an excellent performance as Star Lord and his mask is pretty cool as well. Overall, I have barely any issues with this movie that are severe, all of the characters have great depth and amazing performances. I cannot wait to see what James Gunn does with 'The Suicide Squad' in 2021, because it looks like he really knows what he is doing with the superhero genre.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the greatest films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and possibly one of the greatest of the decade. This movie looks extremely good on the big screen and blu-ray, if you come across the blu-ray for this film, I highly recommend that you buy it because the effects are very impressive and some of the best I have seen in any other movie that has come out this decade. I will put out my greatest superhero films of the decade list out on IMDB very soon, expect Deadpool to be number one, because... SPOILERS: it is.Grade: A+"
" Bit different

" Marvel's best
",0.6369,0.9821,2020-07-18 00:00:00,9,"As of writing this review I have seen every Marvel movie from ""Iron Man"" to ""Spider-man: Far From Home"" and I have to say ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" still remains Marvel's best movie.
The characters, setting, plot, villain, action and humour are all enjoyable and good. But they're nothing compared to the ending.The ideal movie ending occurs when a seemingly impossible-to-overcome situation is presented and is then overcame in a surprising, unexpected and logical way.
When Ronan's ship crash landed on Xandar after we learned he couldn't be killed the usual way, I gave up all hope of the guardians succeeding. But when they defeated him in such an awesome way, I was simply blown away.
Probably one of the best endings of the past years not dependent on a twist.P.S. ""Dr. Strange"" also accomplished this amazingly.
P.P.S. ""Avengers:Endgame"" did this the worst way possible"
" A Flawed, but Jovial Introduction to a Lovable Crew
",0.8847,0.2531,2020-07-16 00:00:00,8,"I have always thought of Guardians very fondly and considered it to be one of my favorite Marvel films, but I had not seen it in several years. Today I revisited it, and found that although there are still funny moments throughout, and the Guardians themselves are quite likable together, it is certainly lacking as far as drama and stakes. Ronan is a very weak villain, with no real background or defining trait other than being powerful or mean. His plan also is not particularly compelling either, as the destruction of a planet that we are not invested in is just kind of eh. I was also surprised by how many bad actors/bad lines were in this movie (particularly in minor roles), which I think was overshadowed in my mind from previous viewings by the joyful spirit of the film. All in all, this movie does a good job of setting up future films in the MCU and establishing these core characters, and delivers some memorable moments (ie the final dance scene/some good lines), but is not Marvel's best work for all two hours.
Rating: 7.5/10"

" The Star Wars of the MCU
",-0.5574,0.9387,2020-06-28 00:00:00,6,"SYNOPSIS:
Starlord (Chris Pratt) and a group of misfits get together to ensure Ronan (Lee apace) doesn't get his hands on the powerful orb.REVIEW:
If you know me, then you know by me calling this the ""Star Wars"" of the MCU doesn't have the greatest connotation. I am slightly biased as I'm not really a fan of fantasy films (more so meaning different worlds and non-human looking characters) and I'm not a big fan of movies set in space. With that being said, I don't hate the film. I know so many people have this in their top 5, but for me it's a lower half film. Although, I do love Chris Pratt, I think there's a few moments where his acting really missed. This occurs over the course of the MCU films that he appears on. There are simply a lot of space fighting scenes that I just get bored by and the strong point for me is the scene in the prison and the soundtrack. I also find Nebula's character extremely corny. Far too intense for my liking and whenever they try to give her a comedic line it falls so incredibly flat for me. It hurts for me to say that cause I love Karen Gillian. I'm also not a big fan of Rocket. It's hard for me to be critical to his character since I feel it's just a taste thing for me. I don't find him funny and I'm not ever waiting for him to be on screen. Again, I love Bradley Cooper though. A couple things I do enjoy are Drax, Groot, Starlord (for the most part) and as I mentioned earlier the prison scene and the soundtrack.I know it sounds like I hate this film based off the review I just made, but honestly, I'm right in the middle. I don't really care to see it again, but I know I probably will some day and I'm at peace with that. 6.0/10."

" James Gunn is the greatest addition to MCU
",0.6369,0.9988,2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,"James Gunn changed MCU.Feige's biggest gamble paid off. How this C-List comic superhero group became one of fans favourites is all due to James Gunn and his comedy.Pre-Gotg MCU had comedy but after this movie's success MCU went full comedy. We wouldn't have gotten rebooted comedy Thor if it wasn't for this movie.This has the classic group with misfits. The casting is great, Sarah Hanley Finn is the greatest. This movie launched Chris Pratt higher to the stars in Hollywood. Batista left wrestling and his Drax is a favourite of mine, the unique flavour of humour he brings to the table. Gamora has great backstory and her set was good as Russos fully explored her to greatness, this is why I love MCU, different directors from different movie working together for betterment of whole story.
It was great decision to cast already A-list stars as voice over, Bradley brings everything great about Rocket.The comedy lands perfectly for me. Each character has a bit different style of humour for all people to enjoy at least one. Personally I love Rockets wits but Drax's unintelligence gets the biggest laugh out of me, the numerous times I quoted ' Nothing can go over my head, I will catch them'.Not only comedy, the story is also great with Thanos being build in the back while Gamora and Nebula has their toxic relationship, heart felt Mother-Son breakup with inspiring scenes of 'Take my hand', Rocket lossing Groot with his final line being 'We are Groot', this is such a wholesome movie with the right emotion and comedy.The villain might come as weak but his seriousness makes the scene of 'Dance-Off' much better. James Gunn went full comedy and has a lot of fun with cosmic concepts."

" Teamwork makes the dream work (Spoilers)
",0.25,-0.954,2020-06-16 00:00:00,9,"Throughout this movie, we see an essential development in the marvel series in which we learn of an orb that holds an infinity stone. We follow a group of strangers who learn of the true nature of this orb and its contents. As this movie continues we meet new characters who become vital to the marvel universe. These characters are Star-Lord played by Chris Pratt, Gamora played by Zoe Saldana, Rocket Raccoon played by Bradley Cooper, Groot played by Vin diesel, Drax the destroyer played by Dave Bautista, & Thanos played by Josh Brolin. In my opinion, one of the main themes in this movie is the power of teamwork. Through the introduction of these characters we see the developing relationships between Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket, & Groot who start as a group of strangers pitted against each other. Soon we see these individuals find common ground to motivate them. We learn that each character Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, & Drax are capable of completing hard tasks by themselves, but once brought together they can complete something even more challenging for instance in the scene in which they are in taken to the Kyln Prison, the group of them are able to break out. this is only able to take place because they all work together to complete the task set ahead of them. After they break out they have more arguments but end up establishing a new motive to work together this, of course, being money. They find out Gamora has a buyer willing to pay top dollar for the orb and its contents. This drives the group to find Gamoras buyers and make a sale. Some problems arise and the stone falls into Ronan's' hands.
Ronan the Accuser played by Lee Pace is a person dead set on destroying the planet Xander home to the Nova Corps.
Now Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, & Drax must stop Ronan from destroying Xander. Another great example of this is near the end of the movie where they are fighting an extremely powerful enemy known as Ronan. We see the 5 main characters take on Ronan and when it looks as though all is lost these 5 characters band together using the power stone to defeat Ronan, Save the Nova Corps, and keep the planet Xander safe.
Through all of these examples we can see a motif that has been developed. If these five main characters did not work together, a whole society would have been destroyed possibly even the galaxy."

" Guardians of the galaxy
",0.0,0.9931,2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,"I remember sitting in Hall H at Comic-Con two years ago, when Marvel first announced Guardians of the Galaxy. This came on the heels of the title reveals for Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World, and my initial reaction was one of utter confusion. What the hell was Guardians of the Galaxy? I was completely unfamiliar with the source material, and upon learning that the team featured a gun-wielding raccoon and a fighting tree creature whose could only speak a single phrase, I was even more puzzled.Fast forward to Comic-Con 2013, when James Gunn appeared onstage in Hall H to showcase the first trailer for the film. It was so unlike anything Marvel had ever done before, so far outside the box that I immediately fell in love with it and couldn't wait to see more. Although that first trailer was well-received by the Comic-Con audience, the general public seemed to be scratching their heads in much the same way that I had when the film was first announced. Marvel fans would love this, no doubt, but could this bizarre little sci-fi romp with a cast of unknown characters actually work?The answer is a resounding ""yes,"" as Guardians of the Galaxy is not only an exceptionally well-made comic-book film, but an exceptionally well- made film, period. It's a sprawling space opera with a host of memorable characters, a joyous sci-fi romp through beautifully realized worlds, wildly inventive action sequences, and an almost nonstop barrage of humor and fun. The protagonists are a bizarre assembly of losers and misfits, with the CG-created Rocket and Groot providing some of the most emotional and human moments of the film, and it's all brilliant. Marvel should be applauded for allowing Gunn the opportunity to realize his vision, because rest assured, this film wouldn't have been nearly as good with someone else at the helm.Guardians of the Galaxy has a distinct personality that sets it apart from other Marvel offerings, yet there are enough recognizable elements to remind audiences that it exists in the same world. Clocking in at just under two hours, the film maintains an impressively well-balanced pace, avoiding the problem of over-inflation that many superhero films fall victim to. I can't think of a single moment when I wasn't completely enthralled with everything that happens on screen, and as soon as the credits began to roll I was ready to watch it all over again."
" Favourite MCU film
",0.0,0.9793,2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,I absolutely love this movie. This was one of the MCUs biggest risks yet. Taking a talking raccoon and a tree and pairing them up with a group of misfits seems like a wacky idea but boy did it payoff. The comedy is balanced throughout the movie brilliantly and the acting is top notch. The plot also works really well in this movie. As funny as this movie is it can even get emotional when it needs to be without coming across as goofy. I highly recommend this film for anyone!

Credit should be given to the team to recreate the magic of the Marvel series.Acting is great, screenplay is similar to all the previous Marvel movies although but comedy and that too good comedy is been added to the screenplay, In my opinion Bradley Cooper stole the show with his voice of Rocket and great comic timings. Background music is always strong aspect of Marvel movies and there is no exception in this movie also.The Support cast of the movie such as Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close and Benicio del Toro were equally impressive.I Really enjoyed this movie."

" My Introduction to the MCU... and a Very Good One!
",0.54,0.9912,2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,"Granted, I might be biased towards this particular film when it comes to my MCU ranking because it's the first one I ever saw in theaters and the one that got me invested into this universe. For many years, it held the title of my favorite Marvel movie, and to this day I would place it in my top three.I mean, Guardians has it all : an engaging plot, compelling and quirky characters, one of the best usage of a soundtrack ever and massive implications for the rest of the universe. One of its greatest strengths is also the humour : just enough to keep you entertained, not so much that the movie becomes a parody of itself like MCU films further down the line. Peter Quill's introduction to Redbone's Come and Get Your Love is somehow one of my favorite scenes in the whole franchise, as it establishes the perfect tone for these characters and this world. I have a blast every time I watch this movie, and today was no exception.Oh, and also, Drax the Destroyer is one of the coolest character names I have ever heard. He is pretty funny too."

" Dumb and unimaginative
",-0.5106,-0.1748,2020-04-24 00:00:00,3,"This movie is painfully stupid. It literally looks like someone took parts of all the (relatively) recent blockbusters and morphed that into on. From Lord of the rings to Goonies to Star Wars... you name it. It is as bad and stupid as Prometheus and such.They wanted to make a something spectacular, but this is almost painful to watch. The only character with some weight is a Racoon, and that says a lot about this movie.Vin Diesel's Riddick series look similar to this movie, but in those Diesel didn't even try to be more than a comedic SF thriller. This movie is the same, but it pretends to be much more, and fails at all miserable. It is not even amusing.If you compare this abomination with Goonies or Star Wars (the original 3 pieces), it tried to recreate that kind of family movie that will inspire and amaze, but apart from successfully being ""popular"", it achieved nothing.This is a piece of junk, a kitsch which will soon pass and be forgotten just like myriad of other movies without spirit."
" Imagine what it's like before watching. That's exactly what it's like
",0.6124,-0.9045,2020-04-24 00:00:00,2,"This movie is oddly overrated even by Marvel movie standards. It garnered all this acclaim, was praised as 'Star Wars for this century' by some, and was even included in the 1001 Movies to Watch before You Die book. (Why not include the Fifth Element if this type of thing is going in too?).
Sorry, but this doesn't come equal with Star Wars or Star Trek. It doesn't have the complex world-building or imagination of Star Trek. (Even Serenity was better than this). Star Wars, at least the first six movies, had a very strong story with archetypical fantasy characters that were written well enough. GOTG has a bunch of assassins and thugs who don't really develop except for learning to work together; a predictable story trope that anyone could write and which was in one too many superhero movies even at the time. The story is lame, another 'get the Macguffin' plot line that would later be recycled in future Avengers movies. (With the same Macguffin, no less, and the same use of the Macguffin to kill the bad guys). Watch them team up to get the Macguffin! Then see them use it to blow up their enemies! There, I summarized what is literally the entire storyline.
There are a couple of good quirks in here though...the incorporation of 70s music was a nice change and Chris Pratt sold the childish potty humor around half the time. There are a couple of good jokes sprinkled in here too, but good luck remembering them once the post-credit scene is over.
The directing is flat and similar to any other Marvel movie you've seen before. You can easily tell that Disney hired a squad of second-unit directors to shoot all the action scenes for the blockbuster-inexperienced director James Gunn, because these parts feel exactly the same as all the other Marvel films. (They probably all have the same second-unit team for actions scenes). There's nothing visionary here. It's a pretty juvenile ordeal which doesn't deserve to be called a space opera.
Why Gunn is hailed as a new visionary director is beyond me, as is why everybody made such a big stink when he got fired for perverted tweets. Any director could do this sort of thing if they wanted to: add in your favorite 70s mix as a soundtrack, fill the script with profanity and bodily functions jokes, and then lay back and let the CGI do all the work. It's interesting that so many people are eager to forgive Gunn, when many of those same people rant on about what a rotten person Mel Gibson is, even though Gibson is a miles better director with a much firmer grasp on storytelling. But no, Gunn's 'old' but still sober tweets were from 2008, Mel Gibson's drunken rant was in 2006, and the latter still somehow deserves to be held accountable. I'm sorry, no. It's hypocrisy to the nth degree. I'm looking forward to Gibson's next films and I couldn't care less about whatever junk Gunn is working on now."

" Imagine what it's like before watching. That's exactly what it's like.
",0.6124,0.9476,2020-04-23 00:00:00,2,"This movie is oddly overrated even by Marvel movie standards. It garnered all this acclaim, was praised as 'Star Wars for this century' by some, and was even included in the 1001 Movies to Watch before You Die book. (Why not include the Fifth Element if this type of thing is going in too?).Sorry, but this doesn't come equal with Star Wars or Star Trek. It doesn't have the complex world-building or imagination of Star Trek. (Even Serenity was better than this). Star Wars, at least the first six movies, had a very strong story with archetypical fantasy characters that were written well enough. GOTG has a bunch of assassins and thugs who don't really develop except for learning to work together; a predictable story trope that anyone could write and which was in one too many superhero movies even at the time. The story is lame, another 'get the Macguffin' plot line that would later be recycled in future Avengers movies. (With the same Macguffin, no less). Watch them team up to get the Macguffin! There, I summarized what is literally the entire storyline.
There are a couple of good quirks in here though...the incorporation of 70s music was a nice change and Chris Pratt sold the childish potty humor around half the time. There are a couple of good jokes sprinkled in here too, but good luck remembering them once the post-credit scene is over.The directing is flat and similar to any other Marvel movie you've seen before. You can easily tell that Disney hired a squad of second-unit directors to shoot all the action scenes for the blockbuster-inexperienced director James Gunn, because these parts feel exactly the same as all the other Marvel films. (They probably all have the same second-unit team for actions scenes). Why Gunn is hailed as a new visionary director is beyond me, as is why everybody made such a big stink when he got fired for perverted tweets. Any director could do this sort of thing if they wanted to: add in your favorite 70s mix as a soundtrack, fill the script with profanity and bodily functions jokes, and then lay back and let the CGI do all the work.

" GREAT FUN IN THIS FANTASTIC SCI-FI FANTASY ADVENTURE
",0.9231,0.9993,2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Guardians of the galaxy is just lots of fun with great characters & is definitely one of Marvels best movies.Guardians of the galaxy looks Amazing, i mean beautiful with it's production design & stunningly
created look, it's a work of detailed art. Everything in this film looks Amazing & top notch as it should be with it's huge mega budget & it's all splashed accross the screen for us to enjoy. This is one of best looking sci-fi films ever made in my opinion & IT'S definitely one of Marvels most fun & entertaining films.
The tone is fun, humorous & exciting but still with plenty of danger for our odd crew of space heroes. The characters are such a fun & an odd mix & it all works perfectly. I loved the characters & Chris Pratt is great as the funny lead hero here as Peter Quill aka: ""Starlord"" the Junker & it's still his best movie role, also Dave Bautista is excellent as the extremely tough warrior out for revenge named Drax, also we get a funny gun-toting Raccoon named Rocket, a big tree creature named Groot & a sexy green assassin named Gamora. One Cool odd-ball crew of Space warriors for one big fun adventure with outstanding special effects & a well crafted story & some of the most beautiful sets & backgrounds I've ever seen in a sci-fi flick!!!
The whole prison set piece is Amazing & this Crew is a Group you wanna hang out with & watch again & again.
With an Awesome soundtrack too & plenty of great moments & standout action scenes makes this pure fun entertainment.
Truly a Marvel great that is full of style, wit, fun & pure Awesomeness."

" Star-movie
",0.0,0.9809,2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"The first of the sequence Guardians of Galaxy delivered a different construction of characters than Marvel is used to. Also, creates an atmosphere the complements Marvel's universe and discusses some social/political aspects. Technically, there is no flaws in the screenplay, acting, direction or especial effects, contributing for a whole well-executed cinematography.
The highest point of the movie is the construction of the personas. All the characters are constructed following the line of a group. The development of its real personalities are centered on their role as group. This is different than what Marvel does with Avengers, for example: every heroes is someone and they together are the Avengers. This great way of construct characters, made Guardians of Galaxy follow and discuss the sentimentalism of them and the sense of the group (this last one can be one of the social critiques).
The social/political discuss can be generalized in some questions: what is evolution, as we think?, what comes with power?, what conservationism, masked by tradition, can bring?, etc. Every scene of the movie is a little discrete social/political/cultural critique , shown in a light and clear way (as Marvel loves to do).
Therefore, Guardians of Galaxy is a well-constructed movie, with no flaws in its development, bringing action, discussion and good heroes to Marvel's universe."
" Great all round fun...one of the better MCU entries
",0.7906,0.9988,2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"Guardians of the Galaxy took us somewhat of a sideways step within the MCU from what had come before but in doing so, did open up more plot points and give us a little more information on Thanos, the kree and perhaps more importantly, the all important infinity stones which are essentially the foundations of the universe and it's unfolding story. We will see much more of them in future films as they pretty much hold the key to most things.James Gunn brings us a fantastic vision of the rag-tag bunch of mercenaries, criminals and other assorted beings from the comic book series. A prolific and good writer in the past but as a director he had not really done very much worth noting before this. We need'nt have feared though as this is definitely one of the better films set within the cinematic universe that Marvel has weaved.We open to the late eighties, a young Peter is at the hospital listening to a cassette while his mother lies ill in a hospital bed. Dying she hands Peter a present but he is unable to cope with his grief as his mother passes. Distraught, Peter runs off into the fog of the night, only for lights to appear all around him.Twenty-six years later Peter Quill (a perfectly cast Chris Pratt), now a mercenary outlaw, lands on an abandoned planet and starting his walkman, dances and sings through an old temple while looking for an important artifact. Unfortunately, he is not alone in looking for this object. From here the action never really lets up and takes you on a rollercoaster ride of excitement.We are then slowly introduced to the rest of our main players. Mainly Rocket (voiced by Cooper), Groot (brilliantly done by Diesel given he has just three words of dialogue) and Gamora (Zaldana). Rocket and groot are great and provide the majority of the comedy. Tcene where they try to capture Quill along with Gamaro (who is also after Quill) is very well choregraphed and extremely funny. In trying to capture him, they unfortunately all end up in a prison facility (where Drax is also), so Quill, Gamora, Rocket Groot and Drax band together to escape and ultimately become the Guardians of the Galaxy.The cast here is mostly excellent, even those with very little to do. Lee Pace (in a 180 from playing Thranduil in the Hobbit Trilogy) is excellent as Ronan the Accuser and Michael Rooker is just awesome as the crazy Yondu Udonta, the leader of a Ravager faction (who are equally as mad). Benicio del Toro returns as the Space Liberaci (or the collector as first seen in Thor: Dark world). GIllan is also excellent as Thanos' daughter Nebula and to my mind, it was a shame not see more of her character.Which leads us to Rocket and Groot. Rocket is a mad raccoon and definitely has all the best one-liners. His character is awesome and is wonderfully brought to life both the special effect team and by Cooper's voice acting. Last but not least, Groot is just gorgeous and very scary at times, wonderfully funny and brilliantly voiced by vin diesel. I really don;t think the film would have been the same without him and he even has a genuinly tear jerking moment. I am Groot indeed. Very easy to see why everyone fell in love with him.Guardians also gives us our first proper look at the Kree's (or second, if you pay attention to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and it will be interesting to see how they feature later on in the overarching story. Josh Brolin also makes his first appearance (uncredited) as Thanos as we also get to see a little of him and his possible agenda as he certainly is an interesting and powerful character within the universe.Special effects here are absolutely sopt on and top-notch and really are believable with nothing looking odd or out of place. Likewise, the soundtrack is to die for (if you're a seventies or eighties kid at least anyway) and the film closes with a completely and utterly bizarre post credits scene. A good film to me should transport you within it so you forget you're actually watching a film. Guardians of the Galaxy does that so well that it's runtime seems over almost immediately after you hit play. Great film.The Sage's Rating: 8/10"
" Fantastic!

I'm not usually a fan of fantasy/futuristic films but this is up their with one of my favourite films at the moment.I think part of the reason I feel this way is because although the film has some intense actionsscenes that you would expect from this kind of film.. it also includes alot of light hearted humour. On top of this, I wasn't bored at all, in fact I was intirigued by every scene... the main characters all have their own personas that keep the film interesting.A MUST watch.I AM GROOT."
" Cosmic Adventure is a lot of fun
",0.6808,0.965,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"This feels more like a parody of the previous Marvel movies, then a legitimate one. That's not a bad thing though, because the constant humor keeps you interested and laughing the whole time. With so many retro gadgets, such as a Walkman, this film may make you nostalgic for the 80s. It has heart, humor and Easter eggs galore. Some people may feel they want to skip this one, because the premise is too unusual. Don't do that. The zaniness is part of its charm. Marvel took a risk, and it paid off tremendously.

I suppose it is funny if you are 10 yrs old, The special effects must have cost a fortune and are mostly pointless and reminiscent of the Matrix.

It seems to consist of various unidentified characters going from one unexplained set-piece to the next without giving the viewer any idea of why. It replaces imagination and plot with animation and computer graphics. It meant nothing at all and I just couldn't whip up any reaction to it except irritation. Oh, and why did most of it take place in the  dark? If this is what is regarded as a good film these days, God help us."
" Redeems Marvel!
",0.4753,0.9948,2020-03-10 00:00:00,8,"By this point in the Marvel Universe I'd really lost interest units predictable and boring plot. Captain America, IronMan and Thor were not doing it for me. I remember giving up on the franchise altogether at this point. That is until Guardians of the Galaxy. The first time I watched it, it seemed so new and such a change for Marvel. Although watching it a second time in the context of Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther and End Game (even Ant-man and Doctor Strange) it just seemed like the new normal. It didn't seem so new and outrageous.This movie helped to bring my interest back in the whole Marvel movies altogether. The strength of this movie is its supporting cast. I think all the previous Marvel movies had strong lead actors, this is even more true with Chris Pratt. But they always had such average supporting actors. They were boring, one dimensional and took away from the story rather than contributing to it. Guardians however, has an excellent cast. It goes from strength to strength with the wity humour, logical and clear motivations, character development and emotional investment. I actually care about these characters. Unlike Thors b team of friends.Guardians other strengths are definitely its villains that move outside of shield or Hydra. Man shield is so lame. And its use of music.Right from the start the music sets the tone of what you're in for and it feels so fresh and different. Its light hearted and anything but cheesy.It also moves the overarching plot along with some relevant clues towards Thanos and his motivations.Guardians is a great movie and redeems everything that marvel should be."

" The film was by far the most uncertain and risky move by Marvel Studios. Fortunately, the bet was accurate.
",-0.1918,0.9989,2020-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Continuing the films of its second phase in theaters, Marvel, finally, opens its space saga and has everything to create a franchise of the most fruitful for the company. It is interesting to follow the passion of James Gunn - who also writes the script alongside Nicole Perlman - bringing many of the characteristics of two important cinema halls: space adventure, in the best ""Star Wars"" style and the wild adventure of ""Indiana Jones"" "". Guardians of the Galaxy, truth be told, were never first-rate Marvel characters, just like Iron Man. They have never enjoyed the same prestige as the Fantastic Four, X-Men and others. Only with the new formation of the space team in 2008, the characters returned to the attention of their publisher, causing the comics to win new readers until this adaptation for the big screen. With characters not so well-known to the general public, excessive jokes, as well as a very cool narrative on terrestrial heroes, the film was by far the most uncertain and risky move by Marvel Studios. Fortunately, the bet was accurate.Here, heroes are not presented as heroes, but as wanted criminals who inadvertently meet and connect. One needs the other for the least altruistic reasons possible, but it doesn't take long for this collection of individuals to start operating as a team, especially when they realize that the safety of their piece in the universe is threatened by a terrible villain, Ronan - The Accuser (Lee Pace), who wants to devastate the planet Xandar, home to the space force of the New Troop. The actions are linked together organically through the actions of Quill, Rocket, Drax, Groot and Gamora. At this point, we can already observe the interesting care to balance the presence of his characters on screen, without losing the excessive focus on Quill. Even Groot or Drax, normally silent, are displayed in greater depth.The most captivating are the characteristics of the characters and how they relate to each other. Gomora has a trajectory that goes from Thanos' adopted daughter and Ronan's ally to a traitor who will do anything to save the galaxy with new friends. Peter Quill, the Star Lord, is a sought after looter and the closest he has to a family is Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) who abducted him from Earth years ago. Rocket and Groot complement each other and have a fantastic interaction. If Rocket is a genetically modified, smart, talkative, sarcastic raccoon, Groot is a being of very limited vocabulary, but he is strong and fearless. When everyone gets together, they find support and companionship and become friends to fight for, a true family that no one had ever had before.In commanding this story and seeing the ability of director James Gunn to create an original film without inheriting many of its characteristics, including that of other Marvel characters. The most we can see in a more explanatory way is at the moment the characters are arrested in Xandar, when the characters' running record is read. Besides, the characters are already established in that universe and little by little we get to know and care about each one of them. In fact, the chemistry between these characters is certainly the key point that drives the narrative.In addition to Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana appearing spectacular on the scene, it is important to highlight Vin Diesel speaking Groot's sparse words and, especially Bradley Cooper, who created a voice with intonation, sarcastic and priceless. An excellent dubbing job. Benicio Del Toro, as The Collector, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Ronan's right-hand man. Karen Gillan as Nebula, John C. Reilly as Corpsman Dey and Glenn Close as Nova Prime complete the majestic cast. Lee Pace incorporates Ronan, a villain who poses a real threat to the Nova Empire and makes the story take off, proving to be an interesting opponent to the group of heroes.Exploring other galaxies, the production freely uses and abuses to create new universes, with its monumental and colorful architectures, bold and peculiar costumes, futuristic and super technological spaceships and beings of all types and colors. Without a doubt, the film has the best photography, costumes, makeup and production designer to date in the Marvel universe. James Gunn manages to combine the different and mesmerizing look in a script filled with acid and natural humor, in addition to highly creative scenes of uninterrupted action, culminating in an indisputable formula. Among the action scenes we can highlight that Peter Qill finds the orb and has to flee from Ronan's men at the beginning of the projection; when the guardians are known to generate fun and creative scenes of chase through the streets of Xandar; all scenes in the Kyln maximum security prison; and the phenomenal battle between Raiders, the Krees commanded by Ronan, all the Forces of the New Empire and the Guardians in the final act.I also highlight the exquisite soundtrack. Amid weird names and colorful alien skins, viewers have the figure of Peter Quill, the only human on screen, as their foothold. Taking advantage of the time when Peter Quill was abducted from Earth in the late 1980s, he remains with the object he carried when he was taken and which was given by his mother: m walkmen, highly popular in the decade. On the soundtrack, classics from the decade Peter grew up, like ""Hooked on a Feeling"", ""Moonage Daydream"", ""I Want You Back"", ""Escape (The Pina Colada Song)"" and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough "". The desire is to leave the room and search for the trail on the internet. It is nostalgic and one of the key ingredients of the narrative. The way the songs fit into the scenes is thought out in detail.James Gunn fulfills his role of delivering a masterful film, which presents the Guardians in an irreproachable way to the general public. A film of countless artistic references, which spares no effort to entertain the public. It's two hours of pure action, humor and epic scenes, which marks a firm entrance into Marvel's cosmic terrain."

" Guardians of the Galaxy has viewers Hooked on a Feeling
",0.128,0.9987,2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Esteemed director James Gunn began to form his reputation of creating modern classics by directing and co-writing Guardians of the Galaxy, utilizing all the action, sci-fi, and humor diehard Marvel fans adore. Gunn creates another epitome of Marvel by utilizing spectacular special effects, a strong plot, and an amazing soundtrack of masterpieces all ages can enjoy countless times.
Guardians of the Galaxy follows the life of a human, Peter (Star-Lord) Quill as he transforms from a bounty hunter caring only about his next paycheck to a hero with emotions, fighting for the good of the multiverse.
Peter Quill was born on Earth in 1988, and after his mother's death, he was taken in by a bounty hunter named Yondu, who quickly became a father figure for Quill. Growing up with a ruthless pack of bounty hunters shaped an unapologetic and apathetic life for young Quill, who quickly turned to follow in the steps of Yondo, joining him in becoming a fellow bounty hunter. While searching for an orb worth a small fortune, Quill discovers its true power and value, and decides it is necessary to keep it from falling into the hands of the powerful Ronan the Accuser. Similar to many Marvel classics, Star-Lord needs to band together with unexpected friends along his journey as he attempts the impossible while blasting 70's rock through his cassette player with distinct orange headphones.
Gunn provides fans with an outstanding film that grossed over $700,000,000 worldwide, by utilizing his happy-go-lucky sense of humor, amazing casting and a carefully compiled soundtrack that brings the atmosphere classic rock into modern films. Gunn demonstrates this dynamic combination from the very beginning, where Star-Lord can be seen dancing goofily while fighting small dog-like creatures to ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone. Combined, these characteristics tie together an appealing film that can be admired by everyone.
A marvel movie wouldn't seem adequate without roles being filled by big actors, and James Gunn exceeded those expectations. Big names like Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper fill the roles of key characters, adding to the appeal of this goofy action-packed film.
Perhaps the most well respected aspect of Guardians of the Galaxy is the admired discography. The soundtrack for Guardians of the Galaxy is considered one of the greatest soundtracks in a film, placed amongst other classics like Black Panther, Almost Famous, and Grease. Star-Lord carries the last memory of his mother, a cassette tape titled ""Awesome Mix"", with him at all times. This tape contains numerous well known tunes from the late 60's and 70's, and these songs formed the soundtrack for the film. Gunn uses these songs to contribute to the mood created in multiple scenes. For example, when planning and arming the team for his attack, Gunn uses the song ""Cherry Bomb"" by the Runaways. The lyrics and music to this song create the tension, anticipation and excitement that Starlord was feeling during that moment.
Every film has room for improvement, and this one is no exception. The carefully placed stylistic additions can be concealed by the constant action and violence persists throughout the movie. Like most Marvel films, action is the main priority, so plot and character development can sometimes be lost in the conflict.
Through the entire film, James Gunn helps create yet another perfect example on how Marvel continues to meet and exceed viewers expectations. Each cast member and song was carefully selected, and combined they create a beautiful example of how modern action films can still be calculated works of art."
" Rev of Guardians of the Galaxy
",0.0,0.9985,2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"We've all heard of them, most of us have seen at least one of them, and they are still being created. Marvel Movies: the cinematic series of this generation that includes a wide range of American superhero films. But let's take a look at a seemingly underrated film in the marvel series: ""Guardians of the Galaxy""- a bold and exciting new film that is not afraid to stray from the typical marvel movie expectations. This film, written and directed by James Gunn and released in 2014, is an exciting, humorous, action packed and heart-warming film that takes place in space and follows the life of main character Peter Quill. ""Guardians"" highlights the journey of 5 intergalactic misfits as they, brought together accidentally, pursue their eventual mission to save the universe.""Guardians"" is no doubt unique when compared to the Marvel films created before it. From its flowing humour, explosive fun, and action packed plot, this movie takes on an entirely new aura; the film bursts at the seams with color in its shift from Marvel's usual earthly setting to a galactic one. Additionally, it refreshingly includes visual, artistic and even plot influences from movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"". The inclusivity of these influences and the interstellar scene changes give a special nod to the sci-fi fantasy world as a whole, providing us with moments and characters that can resonate with almost anyone. Visual effects go beyond scene changes, however. These are spot on when it comes to life-like animated characters, such as Groot and Rocket, all the way to the colorful backgrounds displayed in each differing landscape. Despite exquisite shooting methodologies and special effects, the music in this movie may be the thing that pulls you in. From the beginning scene up to the final moment, music plays an essential role in the wonders of this film. The 70's playlist that excitingly welcomes you in the opening scene, brings you along the adventures throughout the movie and is directly connected to Peter Quill's character, will leave you dancing and definitely looking the songs up when you leave.The characters' particularity and individuality is also something to note- not only are they each from different planets and are different species, their dialogue and personalities seem to be just what we needed in a Marvel movie. Not your expected heros, but a bunch of misfits that you'll love, and that will for sure leave you laughing at almost every interaction. With each actor included more magnificent than the one before, manifesting strong messages without the use of words, focusing on human touch, energy and mannerisms to explore a character, the emotional and soul-stirring levels are raw and exuberant. You will fall in love with each of these characters, played by incredible actors including Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana, and the family that they grow to create.If you're not looking for an action packed, fight scene heavy, violent film, however, this movie may not be the movie for you. It adheres to those comic fans that don't desire another simplistic Disney movie. But for those looking for a clean, family-friendly film, the raunchier humor and consistent use of violence may lead you elsewhere.Despite its violent, edgier manner, this film has definitely gathered a large fanbase, as those that have dug deep into the world of Marvel have no doubt fallen into a deep appreciation for the beauty, humour, action and emotion that embodies this film."

" Worth Your Time to Watch
",0.2263,-0.4118,2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,"In Guardians of the Galaxy, a group of misfits crosses paths to save the universe. In the beginning, they were against each other but then teamed up to defeat Ronan (Lee Pace). Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) met by fighting over the orb. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) was trading the orb for monetary value. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) was also trying to gain the possession of the orb for monetary value. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) wanted the possession of the orb to betray Ronan. While they were fighting over the orb, Nova Crops caught them, and they went to prison where they met Drax (Dave Bautista) and began to form the guardians by escaping the prison. Once they escape the prison, then try to keep it out of Ronan's (Lee Pace) hands. Eventually, the battle between Ronan (Lee Pace) and the Guardians of the Galaxy takes place on Nova, and the ending of the fight truly shows the teams transition into a family and defeats Ronan (Lee Pace) and saves the Galaxy.Guardians of the Galaxy shows that theme is family. While Ronan's (Lee Pace) ship is going down, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) grabs Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) grabs Drax (Dave Bautista), and all of them are center in the shot. Groot (Vin Diesel) then sacrifice himself by wrapping everyone into a barrier to save Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Groot (Vin Diesel), Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Drax (Dave Bautista) from the impact of the crash. Throughout the film Groot's (Vin Diesel) dialogue is ""I am Groot,"" but in this scene, he changed it to ""We are Groot,"" which means they are all significant to him because he is saving them while sacrificing himself. What makes this scene pull on emotions is going to be the lighting and music. While the shot is in the ball of Groot, the lighting is dark but with specks of light like lightning bugs. It is peaceful and beautiful to look at, which ties to what Groot (Vin Diesel) is doing for his friends, more like family. The music is beautiful, while the destruction is all around them.In another scene that shows one of the themes is family is when the Guardians take on the stone. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is struggling to keep ahold of the stone, so Gamora (Zoe Saldana) connects with Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) then Drax (Dave Bautista) follows the Rocket (Bradley Cooper) connects with the remains of Groot (Vin Diesel) in his paws/hands. Slow-motion was used wisely to create more emotion and suspense to this scene. It also makes the pain that they are all experience is very extreme, but they are willing to go through the pain to save the Galaxy and for each other.The Guardians of the Galaxy are a bunch of dysfunctional misfits that has lost family but turned to each other to create a new family."

" Another great entry from Marvel, a next step
",0.7845,0.9976,2019-12-04 00:00:00,7,"This movie was breathtaking, with stunning visual effects and great characters with a smart, witty and funny script aswell as a kickass soundtrack. The choice of Chris Pratt as Star-Lord was great and he did awesome in the film. Groot was hilarious and so was Rocket and Gamora. Drax is my least favourite of the four but he is still entertaining and gets some great laughs throughout the film.The movie is very well directed by James Gunn with a very unique and fresh looking colour pallete. The set design as well as the look of all the weapons and spaceships are unique too which all to look very appealing even if the CGI does look a little fake in some of the scenes. The villan could have been stronger too with a deeper backstory, but Thanos in Infinity War made up to that with Marvel villans getting better as the films go along.This was a massive blockbuster hit when it came out with loads of hype surrounding it, now since the hype is still strong for this movie series since the third one is yet to come out. This is still my favourite of the two that has currently been released, not knocking the second one though, which visually is vastly superior, but in terms of writing, character and humor, this one takes the cake. It has excellent rewatch value aswell which entertains every time with the jokes just as funny as they were when you watched it the first time. So much imagination was put into the locations of this movie and it has it's own unique identity and feel. It's a huge departure from the Avenger's movies for sure, but this is not the Avengers. This is something very different entirley"

",0.34,-0.5574,2019-11-29 00:00:00,10,"If there were only two movies ever made, and they were Star Wars and this one, Star Wars would get a 5 and Guardians of the Galaxy would get a 9. But with a sea of movies out there we're talking 10+ here."
" Visually resplendent and fun
",0.5106,0.9975,2019-11-25 00:00:00,8,"The story is pretty typical MacGuffin type stuff. There's an orb that drives the plot. Everyone wants it for different reasons. It has power that comes into play late in the film. It's an Infinity Stone and part of the larger mythology. That's not the joy of the movie. It's on that clothesline of a plot that James Gunn hung an array of entertaining characters who make the journey interesting, and it's all told with such an enthusiastic style and painterly brush.Peter Quill is our main hero, and he's the first to get his hands on the MacGuffin, I mean orb. He makes an enemy of Ronan the Accuser in the process, as well as his former colleague/savior from cannibalism Yondu. He ends up on the planet Xandar where Gamora, the angry daughter of the big bad Thanos and soldier for Ronan is trying to betray them both by stealing the orb and getting it to the Collector. While trying to get the orb from Quill, Rocket the Raccoon and his tree guardian Groot try to kidnap Quill for a bounty and they all end up captured by the police, sent to space prison.Up to this point, the movie is light and amusing, but it's in the prison, where the four heroes meet Drax and have to work together to escape, that the movie begins to get really fun. The prison escape is witty, inventive, and delightful to simply watch (the movie really does look good from beginning to end). Peter's insistence on reclaiming his Walkman, his most emotional connection to Earth and his deceased mother, is handled with the right tone of enjoyable romp mixed with attachment.It's in the second act that the movie falters just slightly. They meet the Collector and get an exposition dump that's really just there to establish things for the MCU at large and not for the movie itself. In terms of the movie, the scene does bear some narrative importance (it's here that we see what's in the orb, an Infinity Stone, and what happens when it's misused), but the majority of the sequence is really dedicated to world building for stuff outside of it. Rocket also has an emotional beat that feels a bit off to me. It makes sense that he might lash out while drunk and explain a bit of backstory, but it feels like it comes out of nowhere since it immediately follows a nice little scene where Peter and Gamora get to know each other a bit better.From then on, though, the movie is sure footed and clearly successful. Ronan gets his hands on the Infinity Stone and proceeds with his stock bad guy plot #3 of trying to destroy a planet. Quill recruits the Ravagers under Yondu onto his side (with promises of riches) and they start a big, entertaining battle where the characters all get their moments to shine with banter and explosions. We get our big explosions and a final confrontation, and it's all done with such a strong narrative hand that we can easily forgive the ending's generic overall nature because the moments are so enjoyable.Ronan, though, is probably the least interesting antagonist in all of Marvel. He's as stock as stock can be, and I remember Malekith from Thor: The Dark World. There are moments where it feels like Ronan is supposed to be more than just yelling bad guy who yells, but they don't develop anything. All we get is yelling bad guy who yells. I also wish there was more thematic depth to the film. For instance, the moment in the final seconds of the final battle where Gamora reaches out to Peter and Peter sees his mother feels thin. It's just that Gamora uses the same words as his mother rather than anything else in the situation calling back to it.One final note. I love the design of the film from beginning to end. The spaceships look great and unique enough against the typical spaceships we've seen in cinema before. My favorite of them all are the Xandar Nova defense ships. It seems like an odd choice, but the color pallete is perfect, and I ended up seeing this for the first time around the time that the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune got released, and it was screamingly obvious to me that there were similar influences. I looked it up, and yeah, the guy who did most of the designs for the aborted Dune adaptation designed the ships in Guardians of the Galaxy.Aside from a couple of hiccups in the second act and a less than mediocre bad guy, this is such a wonderfully entertaining film."

" I'm distracting you
",-0.296,0.9269,2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Outta nowhere or space comes Marvels first telling of the Guardians of the galaxy. Possibly the most lighthearted and humourous one yet. This is the story of Peter Quill an epic adventure in outta space and a battle for the orb or whatever that does!!!? Later we will discover it will means much more in the marvel cinematic universe as it will be containing an infinity stone. Ronan the accuser is our main antagonist but appears to be given order by someone far more powerful and evil at the core. What's nice about this movie is the tone, it can appeal to both adults and kids for different reasons. It's nothing to be taken too seriously and the plot isn't overly complicated but overall it is still a thrill ride from start to finish. Some self awareness and mockery of the end plan keep this fun feast pulling out every cliche of what is expected. But this is not of the norm, with our talking Raccoon voiced splendidly by Bradley Cooper and the one line wonder Vin Diesel as I am groot!!! Not odd enough for you, add into the mix muscle bound wrestler Dave Batista and you have the full package. Well not quite as Zoe Saldana more than enough holds her own to pack a punch as Gamora. This is very impressive visually too, James Gunn has made his mark on the marvel cinematic universe and we will be expecting to see a lot more from this bizarre bunch. There is some emotional depth too as each classic tune is in remembrance of something Star lord has lost. Although it doesn't have the strongest lineup of antagonists our characters soon become their own worst enemies and create their own issue along the way. Chris Pratt has made star lord one of my favourite marvel characters."

Screenplay James Gunn, Nicole Perlman
Starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Djimon HounsouThe Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun ride, if nothing else. Yes, it comes from the Marvel stable, so you can expect it to be full of banter and bickering among its protagonists. Yes, it is setting up a franchise, and/or adding to the overarching story the MCU is setting up, so you know there will be a studio-mandated climax and a cameo from at least one Infinity Stone. Yet it feels fresh because of the risk Marvel has taken by producing this movie with a bunch of relatively unknown comic book characters.I am a comic geek. Yet I had no idea who these people were. In fact, until the success of the Avengers, I considered even Iron Man and Captain America as second tier heroes in Marvel comics. The trailers didn't help either, as I saw the usual trope of a ragtag team of misfits coming together, led by a well-intentioned man-child, supported by a dumb thug, a faux-feminist tough girl and two animated characters. Yet, this film was enjoyable, and most of it is down to the direction of Gunn and the excellent casting choices.Chris Pratt, who we know as the chubby, funny well-meaning dumb kid Andy from Parks and Recreation (what a character he was), plays a movie version of the same, but has been given a muscled-up transformation. He brings a playful charisma and proven comedic talent to the role of Peter Quill, simultaneously the straight arrow and the goofy sidekick. Zoe Saldana seems to have made a career out of playing alien characters with paint drawn on them. She plays Gamora, the tough girl protagonist and possible love-interest to Quill. There is a super-intelligent, genetically engineered raccoon named Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, and a genial tree called Groot voiced by Vin Diesel in his best work ever. The find of the movie is Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, who shows off his comedic chops while also suggesting a complex emotional being underneath. The antagonists are unfortunately pale personas. The talented Lee Pace is wasted as Ronan the Accuser, who is actually a pretty complex character in the comics, reduced to villain plot device in this movie. Djimon Hounsou and Josh Brolin play even more thinly drawn characters, although their screen time is much restricted to be of any utility. Glenn Close, John C. Reilly and Benicio del Toro make extended cameos in another instance of Marvel casting great performers and giving them nothing to work with.Quill is an orphan abducted from the earth by aliens when he was a kid after his mother passed away, and has been raised by his captors, a bunch of space outlaws. The movie has a Firefly-feel to it, yet this space adventure keeps things grounded by involving many settings that we earthlings can comprehend. The brightly lit space days in similar movies are replaced here by multicoloured cities with interesting but humanoid aliens, grimy prisons and kinky-looking spacecrafts. The characters come together in search of an Infinity Stone, and like in most movies involving a McGuffin; just enough time is spent on it to not bore us to death. The character interactions and the soundtracks are what keep us invested in the movie, in spite of the thinly drawn characters. Perhaps they shall address it in the sequels. After all, Marvel never stops with just one film. In James Gunn's, they do have a capable director who is a geek himself, and treats the characters with respect.VERDICTA definite popcorn movie. Very enjoyable. Watch it with Americans in their 30s, they will lap the whole thing up.6.5/10STRAY OBSERVATIONSKaren Gillan, who was terrific in Doctor Who as Amy Pond, plays Nebula. Here is to wishing her a successful career in Hollywood. As of now she has done two Jumanji movies, and her best movie so far is Oculus (2013)."

The quickly forgettable plot (borrowed from the Lord of the Rings) involves a group of second-rate intergalactic heroes who band together, one of them having found a ball that confers great, almost impossible to control power and energy. Some thuggish types are out to get it for themselves, so let the fun begin. The movies provides a steady jet of lively images and more than the usual amount of humor.

They manage to escape but there troubles are far from over; Ronan wants the orb as it holds the power to destroy those he opposes. Few people they approach can be trusted and much of the time they don't trust each other... it will be a miracle if they can save each other let alone the galaxy!When I saw that this was a Marvel film I initially thought it might be yet another superhero film; it isn't. Instead we get a space opera which is full of action, humour and some fine lead characters. It may not be quite as high camp as 'The Fifth Element' or 'Jupiter Ascending' it is in that ballpark with over-the-top villains and exotic aliens. The plot might not provide too many surprises but it does give exciting scene after exciting scene. The characters are great; I particularly liked Groot; despite his very limited vocabulary. The cast does a fine job; this includes those we see and those who provide the voices for the animated characters. The special effects are top notch; they make the animated characters fit seamlessly into the live action and provide spectacular backdrops to impressive action. The use of music from the '60s and '70s was fun and nicely justified by the fact that Quinn had a tape of his mother's favourite music... of course the idea that he could play it for over twenty years without it being chewed up is perhaps the most unlikely part of the film! Overall I'd say this is a really fun sci-fi romp that can be enjoyed by anybody who enjoys the genre but doesn't take it too seriously."

" Great: 9.0
",0.6249,0.9755,2019-07-29 00:00:00,9,"It never ceases to amaze me: since 2008, Marvel Studios has never gone a year without releasing at least one film, and the vast majority of them have been quite good, despite the juggernaut studio continuously taking chances on various directors (many of whom had less-than-stellar resumes). And this year has perhaps been the best yet, with the masterful The Winter Soldier coming out back in April, and now this. And while Guardians of the Galaxy isn't the best Marvel film this year, it's damn good nonetheless. Since this group of heroes is easily the most obscure of Marvel's lineup to be put to film, the closest cinematic comparison I can make is The Magnificent Seven in space. And though the plot isn't quite as interesting as I just made it sound (it basically serves as a way to tie together most of the post-credits sequences of prior films in the MCU), the rest of the movie is good stuff, with fine performances, a witty script, and plenty of colorful visuals. WIth only Sin City remaining, Guardians of the Galaxy is a fitting sendoff to a summer that has simply not been full enough."

" Modern Day Star Wars
",-0.5574,0.9987,2019-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Guardians of The Galaxy, while not the best film released by Marvel Studios, is probably one of the most fun Marvel movie to date. This is probably the second most enjoyable of these movies to me below Thor. This film was a surprise and I'm glad that this seems to be catching on. This is Marvel's most risky project by far. Not only was this subject matter virtually unknown to the public eye before this but it is also not really a superhero film which Marvel has been associated with up until now. This is basically a Sci-Fi adventure flick set in the Marvel Universe.However, while this film may seem like just a side story unrelated to events in the other movies so far, it is actually necessary in that it further elaborates on certain elements introduced in the other movies in this universe like Thanos and it serves to expand the Marvel Universe and make it more of an actual universe. You also have The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) who cameoed in Thor TDW make a cameo here as well. In that aspect this was a great subject matter to adapt while a risky one and it seems to have paid off.Guardians of The Galaxy is the Star Wars of the current generation. It is a basic science fiction/fantasy adventure story which is sometimes all you need. Lately we've become so wrapped-up in complicated and dark stories that it is nice to have a simple and fun movie that everyone can enjoy if it is done right. That's one of the reasons why movies like Star Wars, Titanic, and The Avengers were so successful and why this one will most likely be a success. Beyond that, this film is very similar to Star Wars in many aspects. You have a group of unlikely heroes going up against a galactic tyrant.The main characters are all great. All of them are memorable, fun, funny, and badass in their own way. I think everyone in the cast does a fine job. There is no one of the main characters I inherently disliked. The side cast was alright though we really do not spend time with them. This is mainly all about the Guardians which is fine.If there is a weak point in the cast and the movie itself it would be the villain. Ronan is really a nothing villain. He looks cool but that is all. He has no character or motivation other than to destroy the cosmos just because he is the bad guy. The way our heroes defeat him in the end is lame as well. This is why Thor is better for me. They are both fun movies but Thor had a better villain in Loki which made the film more enjoyable. Here it's just a cookie-cutter villain plot just like in Thor TDW. However, it didn't bother me quite as much there because this film was more fun. Thor was fun as well, but you had lame humor and some of the characters I did not care for this time around. Here the characters are all likable and the humor is more hit than miss so it isn't as much of an issue.The effects are great. Some people say it is like the Star Wars prequels in that regard but here you actually has characters you care about so it isn't a big deal. The soundtrack is also well put together. There are a lot of songs from the seventies played throughout the film. Sometimes it seemed like Zack Snyder was directing this. The songs were good, well integrated, and added to the tone and atmosphere that the film was building.Overall, Guardians of The Galaxy is a must see movie if you are a fan of the MCU so far or if you are just a fan of good Sci-Fi adventure stories like Star Wars or Star Trek. It definitely is modern day Star Wars. It seems like this will be a hit. It is nice to see previously unknown material (that's good) get the recognition it deserves. I'd like to see where they go from here with this material."

This one made me happier, mostly because it is a space fantasy first, and superhero flick second.Don't get me wrong, it's still an incredibly stupid story. But with the amounts of comedy put in, I can just watch it the same way I watch Spaceballs - to laugh and be entertained, plus add here good environmental designs and some imaginative locales.So, yes, I liked it. Alas, that's all. It's still dumb."

" Dance off to save the galaxy
",0.4939,0.9946,2019-04-28 00:00:00,10,"Guardians of the Galaxy was one of the most surprising films to come out of Marvel. It follows a band of outlaws/misfits/losers that come from all walks of life and are all forced to work together for a common goal that is for once NOT taking down the government. Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill and he makes the character as handsome, charming, and epic as he always does; while each other team member is played to great comedic effect as well as emotional effect. The cast of characters is so incredibly likable and this may have to do with how they as characters deal with their personal flaws and learn to accept them in themselves and their friends. This is the first MCU movie that shows life throughout the universe on multiple planets, with many species of people, that are all living in a large society. It sets up and explains infinity stones providing a way for the audience to follow the large arc of the MCU. Finally the reason this movie got so much praise and publicity, its amazing soundtrack that is both diegetic and nondiegetic. The concept that the whole soundtrack is a series of songs on Peter's Walkman is interesting and fun, it allows for the soundtrack of the second to be easily set up, and it features all of the best feel good songs from a very nostalgic time period. Final note: The dance off to save the galaxy, enough said."

All the characters are fairly well setup.
Peter quill is a great character who has a fair amount of depth and a character that could get explored way more in the next movies.
Rocket Racoon is also a good character and they put some care into setting up his backstory and giving him some depth into his character.
Draxx is a meh character.
He has a basic Background story and he gets a mediocre character arc.
Gamora is fine and the manage to set up and develop her pretty good.
Groot isn't anything special but his death scene was a pretty touching moment.
They manage to set up and give fair character arc to all of these people and i hope that they improve on that in the sequel cause i felt that the characters weren't as strongly handled as i hoped they would be.VILLAIN
The villain is just nonsensical and stupid.
He has a weak motivation and i don't know how he rose to power.
I mean how could he have thought that it was a smart idea to try to kill Thanos the guy who managed to do everything the Guardians of the Galaxy were fighting against the guy who could defeat Hulk using the power stone (and Hulk is really strong) i just don't like this villain.SOUND
I have never ever critiqued Sound when it comes to music cause i'm not good that doing it but i will tell you the music in Gotg is great.
Using old school music to convey a certain emotion or theme and when they don't use old school music it's still great and manage to execute the tone it's trying to convey expertely.CGI
The cgi is amazing and it manages to set the tone for the enviorment and through visuals they manage to show the state and tone of the planets which is always good when you make a movie with a big world that needs worldbuilding.
And btw there are alot of humans in those galaxies shouldn't it be more aliens or strange creatures you know to diversify the world so that it dosen't feel to blandVERDICT
Solid movie but could have been better with stronger developed characters and a better villain."

The character interactions here rival the Wheadon penned interactions in The Avengers and the Gunn's direction brings the strange worlds he has created to live in striking ways. Gunn was given a chance to showcase his humour and he ran with it, Guardians goes from dark and meandering to fun and rapidly paced within seconds and it is a complete jot to watch no matter how many times you have seen it."

It was just alright.The characters are ok, nothing amazing, but there's enough there so I don't hold them with contempt. Comedy is subjective, but it was generally ok. Music's ok.

I don't know what would have made it better. Especially on rewatches, I give this film a 10 (just right) out of 10. {Space Heroes Action Adventure}"
" Truly amazing
",0.7717,0.9818,2019-03-16 00:00:00,10,"An absolutely amazing film, James Gunn created something truly amazing. First off, I'm amazed at how he managed to introduce five new heroes and make us care about them all (DC, take notes). Honestly, this is what Suicide Squad should have been, and I'm hoping James Gunn does what he did with this for his Suicide Squad reboot. On the other side though, some of the humor didn't hit as hard as it used to. That's one thing I think Guardians 2 did a bit better. All in all though, this is one of the most creative and interesting comic book movies I've seen."
" Not Perfect But Not Bad Either
",0.4168,0.9985,2019-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Since this movie starred Chris Pratt, it's no surprise why I wanted to see it so much.Now, this movie is far from perfect and with no offense to James Gunn at all, hearing that he won a Best Director award is really over-reaching. I'm not saying he's bad and definitely has potential, but I'd be lying if I said he was, say, Spielberg for example. Again, now THAT is over-reaching. I've seen reviews for both this and GOTG: Vol 2 saying that he was trying too hard to impress people and that the effects are kind of distracting from the story itself; I think I can agree with this. While the effects are actually pretty good--especially with Rocket, Groot and any fight that comes along--if you think about it, the movie is kind of ""loud"", so to speak, and it'd be better if the story was more important/symbolic than just ""ooh, look at this."" Now, if that was his intention, I can't say, but it feels like that as you're watching the movie. Plus, some of the acting/dialogue/jokes aren't done very well and are kind of lame in a way. Take Nebula for example; not only does she talk slow sometimes, but also, she's always talking in a breathy kind of way. And this isn't just within the first scene or so; it's through the entire movie, same with Gamora and Ronan without any depth at all. At least sometimes. Chris Pratt is amazing as always but I just think he could be better if he just simply had a better director. Again, no offense to Gunn, but that's just how I feel; same with Colin Trevorrow in Jurassic World. Speaking of Ronan, I do wish he had more depth added to his character, instead of coming across as a whining baby that doesn't get his way. Plus, at the end when the Guardians are holding hands with the Infinity Stone in Quill's hand, I can understand why HE can control it, but what about everyone else that DOESN'T have celestial blood in them? I understand the whole teamwork thing, but if you think about it, it doesn't make much sense at all. Also, ""turd blossom""? What does that mean? And ""this one here's our booty"" is so unintentionally funny that it's pretty obvious that the screenplay isn't exactly the best in the galaxy; pun intended.However, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this film, and not just because of Chris Pratt. The characters are easy to care about, the story is fine, the soundtrack is good, and while the jokes are kinda lame sometimes, you still find yourself strangely laughing anyway, making it the opposite of The Emoji Movie for example. It's also very entertaining, very funny, and definitely has a lot of heart added where, again, it's easy to care about the characters as a whole. Plus, Thanos makes an appearance and Gamora and Nebula are actually pretty hot, same as Pratt. And you get to hear Chris sing, which is always a bonus, as well as his monologue towards the end of the movie.So overall, this movie is far from perfect and could be better to some regard, but if it's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, then you can still get enjoyment out of it without thinking too much about what's going on, or what's going wrong. I wanted to leave this review in order to stand up for this movie as I don't understand why some people hate it. Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but you can still have fun with it. And maybe with a little more practice/time, James Gunn could be better than ever. I have faith that he can as there is some potential here, and that's coming from a very picky/critical girl.So, if you like sci-fi or action/adventure films with humor, heart and pretty good visual/special effects, then I recommend this movie that might not disappoint you. You don't even have to read the comics to enjoy it! Just take it as it is and hold on for dear life."

" Not your typical comic book movie.
",0.0,0.9932,2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"It is comforting to know that the Marvel Cinematic Universe includes the universe. While most films in this ever-expanding movie multiverse take place on Earth, a few like Thor (2011) and Doctor Strange (2016) explore different realms but still tie back to Earth. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is different in that, almost immediately, Earth is left far behind in favor of alien worlds filled with fantastical creatures. Consequently, this film feels more like a sci-fi movie than a comic book flick. Considering how stagnant the superhero formula has become, this is a good thing.With almost no earthly constraints on it, Guardians of the Galaxy is practically indescribable, probably because it has everything. Comedy. Action. A talking raccoon. With a reasonably well-paced plot, this film excels in developing its diverse cast. These main characters each have their unique traits and little quirks that almost immediately made them amusing and endearing. From tough-as-nails Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to idiom-ignorant Drax (Dave Bautista) to snarky mercenary Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his singularly-phrased partner, Groot (Vin Diesel), these members of the rag-tag group that saves the universe create a well-rounded team.Of course, I would be amiss to mention the substantial influence of nostalgia on this film in the form of Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). The soundtrack of classic rock songs is an interesting counterpoint to the visual spectacle that goes along with having a whole universe to explore. While this nostalgia is partly due to a bit of arrested development, it does give this main character a grounded feeling that ties the audience to this far-reaching universe. Everything about this film was fresh and fun, and it certainly makes me look forward to seeing where this piece of the Marvel franchise goes.Not your typical comic book movie, I give Guardians of the Galaxy 5.0 stars out of 5."

" An okay sci-fi adventure with lazy attempts at style.
",0.1779,0.9759,2019-01-29 00:00:00,4,"Why are cocky, quippy superheroes so annoyingly popular right now? Of the protagonists, Rocket and Quill are the worst for it, where it feels like every scene (no matter how serious) must come bundled with a dumb joke. The characters and performances in this film are fine at best, and at worst they're Chris Pratt, who clearly couldn't care less. Genuine character moments are either forced, like when Rocket gets drunk and gives his sob story, or deflated by a joke, and it feels like the characters don't really change beyond Marvel's usual learning-to-work-as-a-team arc. It's a shame, because on paper the Guardians are a colourful and varied cast of characters.The story is also kind of lazy, and it's the sci-fi world-building that holds it up most, with lots of ""Star Trek""-esque aliens and cool locations. I like Nebula and Gamora's sibling rivalry, and the separate directions in which it takes them, but I don't like the awkward love story between Gamora and Quill, the mostly unfunny dialogue, or the cheap dead parent backstory. There are far too many moments that want to be epic or cool, but moments like that come naturally, not because you force them. The only people who feel like they're in danger are nameless Nova pilots or Xandar citizens, but never the protagonists - despite moments where they seem like they're about to die, Gamora and Groot each survive once and Quill twice, so there are no stakes.The soundtrack is something people love, but it's just a playlist of recognisable songs, and most of them only fit the scenes they're playing over in the vaguest sense of mood. It's a cheap tactic to make the film seem quirky and colourful. Speaking of colourful, the cinematography can be gorgeous to look at, though it's let down by poor-looking energy VFX (lasers, holograms, etc.) and too many things cluttering the screen during action sequences.Marvel's tried-and-tested formula is just repeated here, but with extra pizzazz. It's a story about people working as a team to defeat a one-dimensional villain, and it has all the beats of the most average adventure film imaginable. A handful of beautiful visuals and some neat sci-fi world-building aren't worth it.4/10."

" Funny, frenetic MCU CGI-fest
",0.4404,0.9946,2019-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Peter Quill, or ""Star Lord"" as he anoints himself, ends up 'meeting cute' with a team of unlikely heroes including Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a slinky green fighting machine, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a highly mercenary, surgically-enhanced meta-coon, Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a laconic but very effective super-shrub, and Drax (Dave Bautista), a very literal, embossed strongman. Together, they take on a planet-destroying renegade searching for one of the Infinity Stones, the glowing MacGuffins that everyone in the current MCU is dying to own. The characters are quite original (in a usually very derivative genre) and very entertaining. The script is full of clever lines and gags, and manages to be funny without being forced (the running joke about Rocket's species is hilarious) and the special effects are excellent, with the completely CGI characters Groot and Rocket being surprisingly appealing and engaging. Comic-relief is often the weakest part of action blockbusters and sticking the tongue in the cheek of a 230 million dollar movie is risky but in this case it paid off. Great work by all concerned and one of the best films in the billion dollar ""Infinity Stones"" story arc."
" This is boring and overrated
",-0.3182,0.9799,2019-01-18 00:00:00,1,"'Guardians of the Galaxy' had the potential of being a great movie. There were really good tools for it, but it just failed in the end. When it comes to the galaxy side of things, this movie was its only hope, but I think it failed at that. This movie didn't look serious at all - just silly jokes all the way throughout. The only good thing about the movie was the villain called Ronan, but he could've been portrayed so much better. He's one of the more underrated and underused villains within Marvel comics. Whatever glimpse we saw of Thanos in this movie, though it was good, it just wasn't enough I'm afraid. It would've been nice to see him at least a few more times just to spice the galaxy up. I don't understand how people can enjoy such movies when they don't know much about such groups, factions or superheroes in the first place, and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is one of them. People just enjoy it for the sake of it, and I'm not buying with that. Personally, I'm not really a fan of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', yet I was still hoping of a really great movie, but it just wasn't I'm afraid."

Classic 70s tunes work so well with Peter Quill's retro-cool vibe which is used perfectly throughout the film. Basically- the movie is perfect as a whole.

Peter, Drax, Rocket, Gamora and Groot are all awesome and have funny moments, but most importantly- you feel conmected to the characters' backgrounds and interested.

" Awesome movie, Marvel exceeds expectations
",0.7845,0.9983,2018-12-02 00:00:00,10,"Guardians of the galaxy starring Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, A.K.A Star Lord, Vin Diesel as Groot and Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon was a great movie. This movie started out in the 80's when Peter Quill's mother is sick. she asks peter to take her hand, but he is too afraid and pulls it back. Moments later Peter Quill's mother passes away. Peter runs out side extremely sad, when he is abducted. Flash forward twenty-six years, Peter Quill is on the planet Morag trying to steal the 'Orb"" while listening to his Awesome mix tape no.1 his mother gave him. Immediately Peter is faced with people after him and the orb when he narrowly escapes. Peter tries to sell the orb but is unsuccessful. This is when Peter runs into Groot, Rocket Racoon and Gamora. Throughout the movie Peter is tested while trying to keep the orb out of the hands of Ronan. Not only is Peter tested but his friendship/ family bonds are tested with his new rag tag team tasked with saving the world.
The major theme of this movie is about family and this is shown many times throughout the movie. Right away you have Peter who seemed to have a happy family before it was torn away from him. He is then abducted/adopted by mentor Yondu. Peter shows that he has a very strong attachment to the mix tape of music that he had from his mother when he was abducted. Right away in the beginning of the movie you have multiple scenes that show up close shots of kids running happily with their pets and parents portraying a happy family. Shortly after the scenes of the happy kids and families Peter is united with his rag tag group that will eventually become is new family. This rag tag team made up of Star Lord, Groot, Rocket Racoon and Gamora are tested putting their friendships and trust in each other to the test.
It was interesting to note right away the film establishes the strong connection between Peter and the Walkman that plays the Awesome Mix Tape no. 1. In the middle of the movie you see this again as the mix tape is shown playing in the space ships cassette radio. Again, you see this same radio at the end of the movie when everything is in pieces the radio that was in the space ship seems intact.
Overall this was a great movie that I can see watching multiple times. There was the perfect balance between comedy and action. The comedy in the movie never reached the point where it would have made the movie feel cheesy, but instead fit in the scenes perfectly. The acting was great each character seemed to fit their roles very well making everything seem natural. The use of lighting throughout the movie was spot on always representing a contrast between good and evil. Each member of the team came from broken families, but after multiple tests this team of superheroes comes out as a strong and happy family."
" One of the funniest movies of all time
",0.5574,0.998,2018-11-30 00:00:00,9,"Guardians of the Galaxy was made in 2014 but still one of my favorite movies to this day. It's a comedy and action movie that is full of funny moments and action packed and has some of the funnies cast and lines of all of the marvel movies.
My favorite character in my opinion is star lord also known as Peter Quill. He's my favorite because he's the main character and he says the best lines especially near the end of the movie. I would rate this movie a 9/10 just because I think it should be a little longer.
In the movie thanos appears near the middle of the movie and he ties into other movies that were released recently. I really like that because the creators of the movie played attention to the little details and incorporated them into later movies. Thanos is later in the new avengers and so is the crew of Guardians of the Galaxy and it just all ties together and that's what about marvel.
Also the main song in the movie is ""hooked on a feeling"" and when I hear that song I think of Guardians of the Galaxy. One thing I wish they did was in Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 they used that song because that's what makes me remember the movie.
There's always something happening in the movie and nothing is ever boring. When there is an action seen it looks so good and it's always intense and full of bright colors and moving objects. Also I like how they incorporate old music in to the futuristic time period. I think the first Guardians of the Galaxy was better than the second one because I think there is more funny moments in it and I like in the beginning where he flashes back to when he was a kid.
Overall I love this movie because it's just so packed with action and hilarious moments. You need to see this movie if you haven't already"

",0.3612,-0.6711,2018-11-18 00:00:00,10,"This film is aimed at the teen/preteen audience but is done well enough so everyone can enjoy it. The movie centers around a group of five ""losers"" who are after an orb that looks like a baseball size ""snitch."" I couldn't help but think about other block buster films while watching this one. Our 5 ""good guys"" are:Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is the main character. As a child he was abducted from Earth right after the death of his mother. He carries with him a Sony Walkman and plays a cassette tape that should have disintegrated long ago. He is a combination of Hans Solo and Kevin Bacon from ""Footloose."" His playing of classic rock tunes gave me a flashback to ""Heavy Metal"" as they looked for the orb.Gamora (Zoe Saldana)- works for bad guy Ronan (Lee Pace). She is green like an Orion slave girl and every bit of pretty. She refuses to be an easy conquest for Peter and refuses to dance. She is after Peter for the orb.Rocket (Bradley Cooper-voice)- perhaps short for Rocket J. Raccoon. He is a genetic experiment and a bounty hunter after Peter for the bounty. He is quick and clever, but touchy about rodent remarks.Groot (Vin Diesel- voice) is a Treebeard looking character. He can only say ""I am Groot"" which Rocket can understand from tonal inflections. In the beginning they are a pair like Master-Blaster, except Groot's character ""grows"" during the film.Drax (Dave Bautista) is a muscle bound individual reminding me of a dumb Riddick, which is maybe why Vin Diesel didn't play that role. He is out for revenge against Ronan.The main bad guy is Ronan. We know he is a bad guy because he wears a Darth Vader helmet, has a guy who looks like Darth Maul guard him and answers to an Emperor looking fellow. The difference is that is Ronan lacks the heart and humor of Darth Vader.This is a galaxy where everyone speaks English, but no one understands the metaphors. The film is light and formulaic. It is very entertaining and demands a sequel. Just don't think too hard.Parental Guide: Quill flips a guy off. Some PG-13 swearing. No f-bombs"

The acting was really good especially from Bradley Cooper and Chris Pratt. But Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista were good. I can't really say much for Vin Diesel because he only says five words. But Groot did make me feel sad. I can't believe a tree saying ""We are Groot."" gets me emotional but it does. So, good job! People complained about the plot but that was the main thing of it. The main thing your supposed to see is the theme about family. How your friends can be your family. The villain was weak but once again the film isn't centered around him. He's just there to move things forward. The beginning at ending were very emotional and I didn't cry at the end (I don't ever cry during movies) but it did make eyes teary. I didn't cry, but my eyes did water and that's good enough for me. So overall this film was great and its my second favorite Marvel movie behind Infinity War.

Did someone think a CGI mess sprinkled with one liners was a good idea? Where is Youngman when you need him ""take this movie please"".
I know I am late to the game but I avoided this for years just because it looked stupid, sometimes ""I hate being right"". After a few people, who's taste in movies I no longer respect, told me ho good it was, I tried to watch several times never getting all the way through.

" The Best in the Galaxy
",0.6369,0.9995,2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,"When you think of an intergalactic movie, you will probably think of Star Wars because it is one of the longest running and most successful franchises in the movie industry. However, Guardians of the Galaxy directed by James Gunn, encompasses a mix of the action and adventure from Star Wars with the humor of a comedy to become an iconic household name. The Marvel movie was released on July 21, 2014. The movie stars Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, also known as Star Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser, and Benicio del Toro as Taneleer Tivan or the Collector. The movie takes place in various places around the galaxy, both in space and on planets. James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy goes far beyond the average cosmic adventure by successfully blending intense action packed scenes with impressive graphics, hilarious comedy, and heartfelt moments. The movie was also made with an amazing mix of 70's classics and a powerful message that you can do more together than you can alone that made it one of the best blockbuster movies of the year.
 This movie adds the latest team of heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie begins with an opening scene taking place on earth in 1988. The character's name is Peter Quill and he is with his family because his mother is in the hospital about to die. He's outside his mother's room listening to music from his cassette tape labeled Awesome Mix Vol. 1. When his mother is about to die, she calls Quill over to her bed and wants to give him a present. But, he won't accept it so his uncle takes it and puts it in his backpack. When she dies, Quill runs out of the hospital, onto a grassy field. Then a spaceship filled with space pirates who call themselves the Ravagers come and kidnap him. In the next scene, it's 26 years later and Quill is grown up, and on a planet called Morag. He steals an orb, but is later caught and thrown in a prison called the Kyln after a fight with the assassin Gamora and bounty hunters Groot and Rocket on the planet called Xandar. While in prison, these four meet an inmate named Drax and together they find a way to escape. They try to sell the orb to the the Collector, a man who collects the rarest things of the galaxy, and he reveals it to be an infinity stone, an ancient item of great destructive power. Ronan appears and steals the orb. He uses the infinity stone inside the orb to infuse his hammer with power. With that power, Ronan planned to destroy Xandar, but Quill's crew steals the stone back and uses it to destroy Ronan and save the planet from destruction. In the aftermath, Quill gives the real stone to the Nova Corps, the police force of the Nova Empire for safe keeping. For their heroic actions, Quill's crew becomes known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Finally, Quill opens his gift from his mother given to him all those years ago, and it's revealed to be a cassette tape of his mother's favorite songs labeled Awesome Mix Vol. 2.
 In a user review on IMDb, one reviewer wrote that the Guardians of the Galaxy was bad because there is a bad soundtrack. The songs choices made sense, they complimented what was going on in the movie perfectly. When there was a happy and playful scene, there was a song in the soundtrack that was playful and when there was a sad song the soundtrack played a more morbid song. They even made you feel more comfortable, as Gunn put it, ""the music was a way to invite you in and make you feel a little more comfortable, because it's something we're familiar with in the face of all this oddness."" He was right; the 70's classics brought a piece of Earth to the vast galaxy which helped connect the audience to the movie better. The soundtrack was also nominated for a Grammy for best compilation soundtrack for visual media, so the reviewer is not correct in saying the soundtrack was bad if it was recognized for such a prestigious award. One reviewer wrote that the movie was only non stop action and that it ""failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me,"" but there are actually a lot of slower moments in the movie that balance out the fiery action scenes. One example is the scene where Quill's mother dies. Another example was when Groot decided to put his life in danger even when he knew he was going to die in order to save the rest of Quill's crew from the impact of Ronan's crashing ship. Before he sacrifices himself, Groot says ""We are Groot,"" his first sentence ever that wasn't ""I am Groot."" Rocket thinks Groot is dead, but luckily he finds a twig left that can be nursed into a new Groot. Rocket isn't the emotional guy in the movie, but he's starts breaking down over the death of his friend. These slower and more heartfelt scenes are needed to make a good movie, great and this movie successfully showcases a variety of emotions that made it great. Another reviewer wrote that the CGI characters and animation were poorly made, but there were very detailed characters and animation. For example, Rocket and Groot were extremely detailed. You could see the individual furs on Rocket and the indentations on Groot's body almost as if you were looking at a tree in real life. When you look at them you wouldn't be able to tell they weren't real other than the fact genetically modified raccoons and walking trees don't exist. The movie was also nominated for numerous awards for visual effects and and makeup and hairstyling, including two oscars two BAFTA awards, four Saturn awards, and winning the best makeup Saturn award which proves how well all the designs were for the movie.
 Of all the reasons Guardians of the Galaxy was so good, the biggest reason was because of the message it projected. It projected an important message of working together is better than doing everything alone and it also emitted a close sense of family. I thought their message was something everyone could use in their everyday lives and that it would help improve and relieve the stresses of life. You can see the characters show this life lesson in many of the scenes. An example of this is the prison break. None of the guardians could have broken out of the prison and as fast as they did without the help of the others, well except for Quill who was told to get a useless prosthetic leg as a joke. But, even Quill had an important part, he provided the ship they would use to escape. They all had important individual roles that made their task a lot easier. Instead of Gamora having to find an arm band to control the facility, hold off all of the guards, obtain the prison's power source, secure the watchtower, use the power source and arm band to shut off the artificial gravity, and find a ship to escape it, she only had to obtain a guard's arm band. The process of escaping was much more efficient when they all worked together. You can see the value the guardians place on family because by the end of the movie, they are all willing to die for each other. When Quill steals the stone from Ronan, he is immediately affected by the stone's power and is about to die from it. Then Gamora reaches out and grabs his hand sharing the load of the stone, then Drax and Rocket do the same knowing it might destroy all of them. But, they couldn't let Quill die so they did it anyway.
 Another reason Guardians of the Galaxy was so good was because of the hilarious comedy woven throughout the movie. The comedy provided a lightheartedness to the movie that made it very enjoyable to watch and the implementing of comedic moments was so successful, that more comedy was added to some of Marvel's future films, such as Thor: Ragnorak. One example of the movie's funny humor is when the guardians are trying to escape prison. Quill calls Drax a walking thesaurus and Drax says ""do not ever call me a thesaurus."" Then Quill says it's a metaphor, but Rocket says, ""metaphors are just gonna go over his head."" Drax responds by saying, ""nothing goes over my head, my reflexes are too fast. I would catch it."" Gamora is thinking, ""I am gonna die surrounded by the the biggest idiots in the galaxy."" It's so funny that Drax takes everything so literally and responds so bluntly to it. Another funny scene was during the credits when Baby Groot was dancing to ""I Want You Back,"" but when Drax turned to look at him, he immediately freezes and later continues once Drax looks away. A third funny scene is when Quill challenges Ronan to a dance off right at the moment he is winding up to destroy Xandar so he would be distracted as Rocket and Drax prepare to shoot a projectile at his hammer to free the stone. There are many of these hilarious scenes that helped the movie to stay light and fun. Also, most action movies don't have any comic relief, but this movie does which made it very memorable because rarely does an action movie balance both action and humor perfectly.
 In conclusion, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was rightfully the biggest movie of the year due to its outstanding performance in expressing various emotions, beautiful graphics, a top selling soundtrack, and for presenting an inspiring message. The director was very successful in making this a must watch movie for everyone. If the sequels to this movie are anywhere as good as this one, we are looking at many more to come and if you haven't seen this movie, watch it now."
" A delightful surprise. My favourite film.
",0.7096,0.9857,2018-10-12 00:00:00,10,"I was originally going to the local cinema to watch another film, I don't remember what, but was told I couldn't watch whatever it was as it was causing nightmares to family and friends through how scary it was. Instead, we opted to watch Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm not someone who's massively into superhero films, but I came out of GOTG wanting to pay to watch it again.Simply breathtaking. Directed brilliantly, subtly, clever humour and the story line is original, pleasant and very well put together.Lots of emotions were experienced when watching this, and it's not my favourite film ever - alongside David Brent: Life on the Road.10/10 would recommend to anyone, any day and under any circumstance."
" Refreshingly wonderful
",0.5719,0.7543,2018-10-12 00:00:00,9,"It's refreshing to see a Superhero movie where you don't know the plot or the characters, and although this is still standard Superhero fare, it is light, jovial and imaginative, just like a comic should be. The setting is full of wonder, larger than life characters and consequences on an epic scale. The film has some funny moments, lots of spectacular, colourful special effects and riveting action scenes. Entertaining throughout, but due to the quick pacing and so much going on, a lot of the aspects are touched on without much depth."
" A daring experiment for Marvel
",0.6486,0.9864,2018-10-11 00:00:00,7,"I really liked the main characters in Guardians of the Galaxy, but this movie has a cookie-cutter story. It's easy to predict what's going to happen because we've seen it a dozen times. The visual effects are excellent, though, and I laughed a lot. This was a daring experiment for Marvel, and I think they succeeded, I just don't think it's as great as everyone is making it out to be."
" Very enjoyable movie...*
",0.4927,0.804,2018-10-07 00:00:00,9,"Very good movie, with a very good sense of humor, fantastic visual effects, good people. Good soundtrack is very incredible it seems that it is transporting you to another planet and the connection of the group is very good, but maybe in a part I got bored ppr the seriousness of a part but that's the least, watch it, it's a movie pass."
" Ok
",0.296,0.9684,2018-10-07 00:00:00,6,Chris Pratt delivers some nice comedic notes. It's a witty film with some cool CGI but does not particularly deliver the best storyline. Definitely watchable and definitely not bad. Just didn't enthral me.
" Great visuals, music and humor; terrible pandering and agendas.
",0.4767,0.0258,2018-10-05 00:00:00,1,"So we've got generally charming, hot and funny guy leads. Of course.Oooh the female lead though... she's always grumpy and a generic badass character with no comedic elements to her because that would be sexist, no, she's only to be glorified and portrayed as a badass while the much stronger guys are thrashed around by enemies and ridiculed by the script.What a pandering sh-t show. Whether this was the writers or the directors - they really shouldn't be allowed to ruin yet another promising movie with their insecurities and agendas."
" Meh.
",-0.0772,-0.967,2018-09-15 00:00:00,4,"I was expecting much more of this movie with so much hype around it.
The group of heroes does not have that much tension as it should have. I mean, the group consists of different species, but they are so generic, there is a ""guy from Earth, Han Solo style"", ""hot chick"", ""idiot muscle guy"", ""talking racoon"", and a ""tree"", who are trying to kill each other from start, but suddenly trust one another with their lives. No second thoughts, no tension.
We are not introduced to any of the heroes and/or villains thoroughly - we can see that Peter's mother died when he was young... And then what? Apparently, there is more to the story of every character, but we get only partial information and only to the end of the movie.
Then we have some blue villains and shooting starships, and all the generic sci-fi stuff, which is great... But this has been seen before (even the story with the powerful artifact and villain from another planet is not that uncommon, last time we have seen it, was Thor: Dark World, which was a just two movies before this in the series).
So yeah, for this movie to be something more, the characters would have to be more believable. And I don't blame the actors, I blame the scriptwriters.
Some of the scenes are frankly unbelievable and utter BS (the danceoff scene, etc)
Some characters and sets resemble other movies (The Collector and others -> Hunger Games style).In my opinion, this movie fall into the same category as Upside Down and Jupiter Ascending - nice graphics and all, but just for the sake of itself."
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.9717,2018-09-15 00:00:00,10,I love this film a lot and consider it one of my favourite Marvel movies to have been released. This has a lot of action which highlights how each character is and their personality as well as the comedy for each of the characters. Not only this but the soundtrack is one of the best for a movie I have ever seen which makes me want to dance along. Brilliant movie and one I highly recommend people seeing
" I loved it!

The characters are really what make the movie good, even though it's a good story, if they didn't have the charcters they had it would not have been as good of a movie."
" Guardians of the galaxy film review
",0.0,0.9781,2018-09-12 00:00:00,9,"Guardians of the Galaxy was a big chance for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I grew up reading comic books; I started collecting them when they were only 15 cents. My aunt and I would walk three blocks to a drugstore; it was hard to find comic books when I was five years old. One thing the Marvel Cinematic Universe has done and done well is keeping the same main running theme that Marvel comics always had running through all their books. It is ok to be different. Whether it was the teenage troubles of Spiderman, racial tensions expressed in the X-men, or the Loneliness and Vulnerability of the Hulk all of them shared one thing in common in some way they are outsiders. The Guardians of the Galaxy reinforces that theme stronger than any of the other Marvel films. It tells us it is ok to be different with a strong message of together we stand and divided we fall thrown in for good measure.
 Guardians of the Galaxy plot-wise is a pretty average superhero genre film with a very undeveloped and underwhelming villain. He only serves as a conflict that forces our heroes to cooperate. It would be a pretty average film if not for the well-developed characters and the relationships between them. When the film starts, we are introduced to the films central hero Peter Jason Quill aka Starlord when he is a boy. His mother is dying, and Peter doesn't dare to face it when he flees the hospital, and he is collected by an alien craft. Next, we pick up with an older Starlord in a scene that vaguely resembles the first sequence of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Starlord is on a desolate planet moving his way through rabbit creatures in a dark, dreary cave to collect an artifact. What it does differently is put our protagonist dancing his way to his goal while listening to ""Come and get your love"" on his Sony Walkman. Starlord has betrayed his pirate clan the Ravagers by stealing the artifact for himself. The leader of the Ravagers Yondu vows to kills Starlord for his disobedience. 
I did a lot of thinking about the characters in this film and their oddities. One by one we are introduced to each of the characters that will form the Guardians of the Galaxy. Starlord is an emotionally distance selfish rogue when we first meet up with him. His powers are smooth talking, seduction, technical gadgets, piloting, and music. Yes, that's right, music may be the single most important part of this character. Starlord is also the stereotypical dumb witted dude character at times for humor. Each of the guardians has oddities that play off each other for great comic effect. Their differences are ultimately what makes them shine. Gamora is the most dangerous woman in the galaxy. She is the adopted daughter, not by her choice, of Thanos the archvillain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe who wishes to impose his form of justice on the universe. Her powers are the mastery of all types of combat. She is an assassin, but she hides a very vulnerable side. When we first meet Gamora, she is working for the villain of the film Ronan the Accursar. Ronan sends the daughters of Thanos Gamora and Nebula to retrieve the artifact that Starlord stole. Ronan has promised to retrieve the artifact for Thanos in return for the destruction of the race of people called the Xandarians. Rocket Raccoon is a talking raccoon that is a master of ranged weapons and explosives; he is also a very good pilot. Rocket has the essence of a raccoon, clever and mischievous. He also has the qualities of other small mammals like ferrets as he is drawn to collecting things and has a love for money. Bradley Cooper gives Rocket a warmth and humor that brings the character to life. Humor is a big part of Rocket's personality. What does a raccoon need to keep it safe? A tree of course. The character Groot is a large tree creature that is paired up with Rocket when we are introduced to them. I think Groot keeps the guardians together and holds the Guardians together in their darkest moment in this film. He always seems to save the day by manipulating his body to get the job done. He has a very similar relationship to Rocket that Chewbacca has to Han Solo. Groot can only say ""I am Groot"" so there are hilarious one character conversations between Rocket and Groot where Rocket is filling in the blanks with his dialogue. Rocket and Groot are motivated by greed; they are bounty hunters when we meet them trying to collect a bounty on Starlord. Our heroes are so selfish and dim-witted that they battle over the artifact in public on the heavy police planet Xandar and get arrested. In a space prison, they meet the last of the Guardians Drax the Destroyer. It's interesting because I have read comics with Drax in them. In those days Drax wore a purple cape, was able to fly and was able to blast energy from his hands. I like the changes Marvel made with the character. Drax is a brute; he has super strength and endurance. He is deadly with the dual knives that he carries. He carries darkness in his soul from the murder of his wife and daughter. Drax is played by the ex-professional wrestler Dave Bautista. Professional wrestlers and athletes don't always do well on the big screen, but by the way Drax is written Dave Bautista does a marvelous job. Drax does not understand the complexities of language; he can't comprehend metaphors which creates humorous situations in the film. Drax is very straight-faced and serious even when he is trying to be funny. The Guardians must put aside their selfish differences to escape from the prison. Each of them must utilize the strengths of their oddities to make their plan work. They take the artifact to a villain in the Marvel Comics Universe named the Collector. He identifies the artifact as an infinity stone. There are only five infinity stones in the universe; they can't even be held by a mortal without deathly consequence. Through an act of selfishness Ronan locates our heroes. The stone is lost to Ronan because the Guardians are not co-operating. The Guardians are not prepared for Ronan's attack. The Guardians are forced to use mining vessels as weapons against Ronan's army of Necrophages. They are not working well together and are separated from each other. Nebula and Gamora have a long feud fueled and fanned by their evil father, Thanos. Nebula is able to best Gamora, who has the infinity stone, in starship to starship combat. Gamora is left floating in space to die. This is where the turning point in the movie is. The conflict in this movie is both internal and external. The main conflict being the heroes' inability to get along. Starlord and Gamora have been wrestling with romantic tension from the first time they met. Starlord leaves his ship and gives Gamora his face breather so she will live but he will die. Gamora and Starlord are rescued by the Ravagers. When Starlord makes the sacrifice for something, he loves things start to change for our heroes. They are able to convince the Ravagers to join them to stop Ronan. We then see one of the most impressive scenes in the film as the Guardians finally come together recognizing they are all outcasts and need each other. They hatch a complicated plan to stop Ronan who now is using the infinity stone to bolster his powers. I am not going into detail because you need to see it for yourself. This movie was created to be entertaining. It is very successful in its goal. The movie is a special effects extravaganza with great characterization showcasing its troubled misfit characters. Though out the film we are shown over and over that these characters are very odd. They are losers, they are misfits, they are freaks, and no one else wants them, they are alone until they find each other. Each character is odd in their unique way. Each character's oddity rubs against the other characters. It is only at the point that they accept reality and realize they have a lot in common that things start to get better for them. It is through their uniqueness and differences that they shine. Each character has a tragic story that has left them alone at some point in their lives.
 Guardians of the Galaxy isn't free of flaws. It borrows from a lot of films. It is a mix match of Star Wars and the Goonies. I can see the character Han Solo in Starlord and Rocket Raccoon. Rocket does the same thing as Han Solo does with Chewbacca when he has one-sided conversations with Groot. Gamora reminds me a lot of the Princess Leia of the Empire Strikes Back. There is a scene between Starlord and Gamora that reminds me of the restrained sexual tension between Han Solo and Princess Leia in the Empire Strikes Back. Drax is a direct play at humor that goes all the way back to Abbott and Costello. The use of differences in dialect set up deadpan jokes frequently. The actors are chosen for their roles because they are playing characters that strongly suit their personality traits. Bradley Cooper impresses me the most by creating a loveable angst filled trash talking Rocket Raccoon. Chris Pratt plays Chris Pratt in all the movies I see him in, and he does it very well. Zoe Saldana is beautiful and has a lovely voice. Her looks and demeanor are direct ironies to the nature of the character she plays to set her up as being odd. Dave Bautista fits the physical presence of Drax, Drax is an unemotional deadpan character that often sets up humor. Vin Diesel plays Groot who only says, ""I am Groot."" I get the same feeling watching this as I do when I watch a film like the Goonies which is a story about a group of misfit kids going on an adventure. You can make an argument that Star Wars is the same movie as well. Star Wars is about a group of misfits who can't get along that is set against an unstoppable force. You could draw the line that in Star Wars our heroes get trapped in a trash compactor and in the Guardians of the Galaxy our heroes get put in prison. There are many scenes and parallels between the first three Star Wars films and the Guardians of the Galaxy."

I wasn't able to stand just about all of the chars, why am I to even root for someone who's making one primitive joke after another?This was just no fun at all (despite terribly trying to be)."
" I'm...hooked on this movie!!!!
",0.0,0.9984,2018-08-18 00:00:00,9,"First off, let me be honest here: while I am a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - I think even their worst movies are good - there really are only two movies that go beyond great into the Amazing territory: Avengers: Infinity War and this one. I gotta say that Marvel had the biggest risk with this movie as virtually NONE of the characters were well-known. Well, when Star Lord told Ronan the Accuser who they were at the end of the movie, he wasn't just saying it to him; he was saying it to the entire world watching the movie, knowing that they were all here to stay!First off, let me compliment director James Gunn. While what he tweeted all those years ago was horrible, IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO!!! Disney needs to rehire him, if only one more time, to complete the Guardians' story arc in the MCU. Only he knows how to do it; this is his baby. What makes it even more sick is that it was an alt-right group who unearthed the tweets. The hypocrisy is downright sickening, and Gunn is unfairly in the firing line. That's right, Disney: you know I'm right. Rehire Gunn, if only for just the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie.Okay, so back to the movie. You want to know what it's about? For those of you living under a rock, it's about a human (Chris Pratt), a green alien (Zoe Saldana), a tattoed (?) alien (Dave Bautista), a raccoon (Bradley Cooper), and a tree (Vin Diesel) in outer space trying to save the galaxy from an evil blue alien (Lee Pace). I know; it sounds so unbelievable and somewhat stupid. But it's not; it's SO MUCH FUN!!!The soundtrack, first off, is amazing. It is full of cheesy hits that have since resurfaced, largely thanks to this movie (seriously, did anybody else listen to ""Hooked on a Feeling"" before this movie came out?). Featuring songs like the previously mentioned ""Hooked on a Feeling,"" ""I Want You Back,"" ""Come and Get Your Love,"" and ""O-o-h Child,"" the soundtrack for this movie is just so off-the-charts, it's awesome!Finally, to the actors. The main reason why I thought Avengers: Infinity War was awesome was due to Josh Brolin's amazing performance as Thanos. Well, with Guardians of the Galaxy, it is the heroes who are the real reasons for the films awesomeness. Chris Pratt is so likable and charming as Star Lord that he comes off as a jerk that you just can't help but root for. Zoe Saldana is fierce and knows exactly how to balance between kicking butt and making people laugh. Dave Bautista, who people mostly know as a wrestler, is set to become the next Dwayne Johnson, since he very clearly loves to act and is having lots of fun; his character Drax has some of the funniest lines in the movie. Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper, who is well-known for both his comedy and action roles, fits in perfectly as a raccoon with an attitude problem. And who knew that a tree voiced by Vin Diesel that could only pronounce the words ""I am Groot"" could provide us with the biggest emotional scene in the movie?! Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan are all in fine and weird form with their characters, while Academy Award nominees Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close and winner Benicio Del Toro all give a certain amount of pedigree to the filmUnfortunately, this movie was made back when Marvel had a problem with its villains, and Lee Pace's Ronan the Accuser was no different. The best villains are the ones that you sympathize with, but because we are given no backstory to the character - because we don't see why he feels the way he feels or he does the things he does - we don't feel connected to him.But, honestly, that's the only weak spot and it is a little one compared to the awesomeness that is happening in the rest of the movie. Thank you, James Gunn; thank you to the music people; and thank you to the actors who all clearly looked like they were having the time of their lives. You guys are the best!!!"
" Visually stunning roller coaster ride with all its elements!
",0.4389,0.9669,2018-08-16 00:00:00,8,"Tone, Script & Story: Our star lord has acquired an orb. Now villain Ronan will hunt him down for that orb with the help of which he can cause destruction in universe. Will Star Lord's 'Guardians of the galaxy' be able to stop Ronan. Things I liked: I liked Yondu with his weapon. I further liked the scene that contains Yondu and orb before approaching end. At last I also liked how Guardians of galaxy restore power of orb and the reason why they are successful.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: To be really frank movies that are a result of adoption to comic book has its own advantages and disadvantages. For me the disadvantage is the action that causes destruction in the movie. Despite that this movie excels in cinematography. It is visually stunning with all its elements. The visual treat is on par with movies like Avatar. The makeover of characters (like groot, gamora, drax, yondu, rocket), the places like nova corp, with all of its components are simply magnificent.Music: There is music which is played by star lord. It was given to him by his mother. It was good, although it dint attract me much. Acting: Everybody associated has acted really well.Final Verdict: If you have not read comic's, the movie brings a lot of freshness with it. This visually stunning roller coaster ride is worth watching."

" Awesome
",0.6249,-0.0246,2018-08-05 00:00:00,9,This film shocked and surprised me I went into it as a recommendation from a friend.The friend I was doubtful of as he really likes dirty dancing and describes it as a classic Mmmmm.Anyway from the beginning to end it encapsulates you and with its amazing soundtrack really keeps going.The characters each with there own attributes and bringing this together to make for a wickedly engrossing film.Your heart will melt your heart with jump and this film never disappoints.Highly recommend a watch.
" My favourite MCU movie
",0.0,0.9221,2018-08-03 00:00:00,9,"Recently just rewatched this and still love it.
The first scene with Chris Pratt with the great music where he collecting the orb sets the mood for the whole movie. Good tunes, action and with humour thrown in. 
I went in open minded as I am not a comic book fan so didn't know who the Guardians were and I was blown away. And rewatching helped me make sense of the MCU I had missed before. 
 Highly recommended."
" Words are not enough
",0.0,0.948,2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Giardians of the Galaxy is one the best of MCU and 2014. With awesome dose of comedy, action, drama, little romance, adventure, thriller, superhero, great vfx, this movie is lifetime watchable but not watchable with your family.

" Self-awareness, great humour and laughs about a rag-tag bunch of galaxians
",0.886,0.5563,2018-07-25 00:00:00,7,"An American fantasy action comedy; A story about a boy abducted by aliens who grows up to be a mercenary in a far-flung galaxy. He joins a band of misfits and does battle against a timelord intent on destruction.
This bubblegum sci-fi comedy with an anarchic feel has edge, zip and zest. There is a wisp of Star Wars: A New Hope in the ether and a healthy dose of wink-to-audience wit. Chris Pratt brings charisma and there is a good turn from David Bautista as the big brut who fails to understand metaphors. It's the absurdity that keeps it moving along and for a long film credit must go to the writers and director for a very funny and dazzling adventure."
" Weak script, bad character development
",-0.7506,0.9909,2018-07-24 00:00:00,5,"I was really disappointed with this movie. Having known the fantastic comedic talent from Pratt, he delivered what he does best. However, I can't say the same from his ""friends"". They go from complete strangers to best buds in a few minutes, with no motivation whatsoever. It's like they are force feeding you their friendship. Why present all the heroes with such haste ? The movie would've been great if it was focused in Quill's character development only, which is something you could easily deliver with a better cut. Friendship takes time, motivation, reasoning, sacrifice. This movie may be fun to watch, from a kid's eyes only."

" The best film in the MCU.
",0.6369,0.9895,2018-07-12 00:00:00,9,"This sci-fi masquerading as a superhero flick is the best film to come out of the MCU. It's laugh-out-loud funny on multiple occasions, it has a great cast of unique characters that are all played fantastically by the actors, and the story has a beating heart at its core. The film works so successfully because of the way in which alien characters (including a hybrid raccoon and a talking tree) are realistically portrayed and developed. Somehow the film manages to always feel human and something that we can relate to. On top of this, the action sequences are spectacular and, since we truly care about all of the key players, there isn't a disconnect between the audience and the CGI on display. Also, who could forget the film's fantastic 80s fuelled soundtrack that plays a large part in the story and the character development. The best thing about the film, however, is that it's an utter blast from start to finish, no matter how many times you have seen it. It's blockbuster filmmaking at its best. 9/10"

" Couldn't Care Less about this movie
",-0.3875,-0.5675,2018-07-11 00:00:00,2,"This movie is a crock of garbage. It's confusing, boring and flat out stupid. I was confused through nearly every point in the entire film except for a miniature few. I'm not some jealous guy venting just because he's mad at people who can make good movies, this movie is actually bad. Some of the humor was okay, but the storyline just flat out confused me! This movie had me lost half-way through, and near the ending, I was trying to think in my brain what exactly I just watched. Some guy named Star Lord who lost his mother and there's some blue guy who had something to do with him and hours later he turns out to be one of the most important characters?! WHAT?!!!! This movie made no sense to me whatsoever. Thumbs down.The only redeemable quality about this movie, hence the reason I gave it 2 stars, is that the characters are well fleshed out. I like the characters. I like their personalities and quirks, and how they appear. They're well made characters! What else can I say? But the problem is that the storyline didn't do it for me. And for me, the most important part is a well thought out storyline that even though some things might not make total sense, the movie as a whole can get you to follow along with at least what the main thing going on is. But with me, I had no sense of lots of important parts in the plot. Some of the effects and characters are cool, but what's the point of a good character if it's not in a good story?For me, I suggest seeing Avengers: Infinity War. That's a good movie. And with Infinity War, as dark and depressing it was, at least Marvel finally made use of the Guardians characters. Like I said, I loved the characters in Guardians, but I hated the story. With Infinity War, I could watch it and understand for the most part what was going on, and the characters seemed so much more likable and understandable and just good and characters that worked very well with the plot! Infinity War uses the characters as they should've been used in Guardians of the Galaxy. That is all."

It was really awkward watching it as everyone was laughing away while I just sat in my seat thinking: ""what's so funny about it?"". It wasn't funny at all for me, it was cringey and I didn't even laugh a single bit. I regret watching it in the cinemas."
" Better than expected, actually.

Hats off to director James Gunn for a styling job well done! The visuals and special effects are incredible, and the non-human characters look amazingly real and blend perfectly with their surroundings. The action is flawless. A good blend of action, suspense and humor. Entertainment value: 10/10. Visuals & make-up: 10/10. Oh, Rocket has to be my favorite Guardian! Bradley Cooper voices him so well!Uhmmm, why was Vin Diesel cast to voice Groot? He literally has ONE sentence - which he says about a hundred times throughout the film: ""I am Groot"", and off course ""We are Groot"" at the end. OK, so he had TWO sentences to learn. They might well have recorded the sentence and used playback. No-one would have noticed."
" Most comical of all Marvels series

Peter Quill, the lead possess an orb that has contains one of biggest powers of the universe, the infinity stone. The entire storyline is linked towards the quest for acquiring the stone.
The comical role played by Drax was cool with the add-on of Rocket- most entertaining part of the series. And yes I quote 'I am not 100% a dick'-hilarious.
Groot had an emotional and compassionate role, probably signifying the role played by the trees. He risks his life several times sacrificing it entirely in the end to save the others. 
Showcasing of Ronan was a little horrific but the lead was taken by a little introduction of the most powerful, Thanos.
The romantic element between Gamora and Quill is gradually building. Movie ends up with a happy note of finding a baby Groot still has life."

Gamora's pretty non existent, she's basically just used as a sound board, why Zoe Saldana I ask? Drax had me worried to begin with, but got better as it went on. Rocket and Groot, the cgi characters the standout, there really is no film without these two characters, providing comedy and heart. All the other characters are terrible and just eat away at the enjoyment.Some fun's had and the ending's good, but with an empty story and many wasteful scenes it fails as a whole.Drax: Where did you learn to do that?

A movie full of humor, adventure, where the wicked-kind universe is not so decided.
It's a movie that you can really see with your family.
It's beautiful, colorful, with special effects well used, we hate to see another opus of these heroes. And we even wonder how the meeting with other heroes marvel will be done, so we are not in the same universe."

The comedy is gold, and doesn't distract you from the plot in the slightest. It flows so smoothly and these characters feel like they were meant to be together. The fact that Disney was able to make a great movie with a talking tree and a raccoon deserves props all in itself. Great job!"
" A pleasant surprise, or how I stopped being afraid and again fell in love with blockbusters
",0.8271,0.9998,2018-06-13 00:00:00,9,"Recently, I began to understand that I was tired of blockbusters: these incredibly spectacular, voluminous, incredibly expensive, but by and large similar to each other and empty films. In 2014, apart from bitter disappointments like the ""New Spider-Man 2"", there were really standing copies (whether the new ""X-Men"" or ""The Face of the Future""), but they also failed to arouse my special trepidation. And that's why I did not expect the ""Guardians of the galaxy"". And if it were not for my long-standing affection for the Marvel universe and the invitation for the preposition, I probably would not even have gone to this film and ... Much would have lost!During the viewing of ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" I was surprised at the fact that it was gradually becoming ecstatic. I could not imagine that I can still empathize with screen characters and laugh at their words and deeds. This film really gave me back the love of blockbusters and revived the hope that in the film world of fiction it is really possible to do something new and unusual.And now I will try to briefly note those components of the film that bribed me the most.1. Cool plot. This tape contains several storylines, which, due to the abundance of central characters, are revealed as completely as possible. The main action is twisted around an artifact, which everyone abducts from one another. However, developing this storyline, the creators of the tape have time to give us and a spectacular escape from prison, and many spectacular interplanetary battles, and the history of the formation of a real strong friendship between the five main characters. The plot develops very rapidly and practically does not sag, keeping spectators intrigued to the very titles. Personally, I would have sopped the melodramatic part of the film, however, the reaction of the viewers to these episodes was absolutely normal, so it's more of my harmfulness and natural cynicism, and not some miscalculations of the writers.
By the way, the film itself is more associated with ""Star Trek"" or ""Star Wars"". So not special lovers of the Marvel universe can appreciate this tape.2. Excellent humor. ""Guardians of the galaxy"" is a very funny film. And the cool thing is that here there is a place of self-irony, as the tape makers coolly ridicule various clichés peculiar to blockbusters. In general, it is necessary to see and hear. Probably, this is the most cheerful film of this year, although according to official information it is not even a comedy.3. Team spirit. I remember two years earlier I was choking with enthusiasm, praising the Avengers precisely for their team unity. However, one can not help but notice that in the Ironman and the company the team spirit was a little bit pretentious. The heroes were constantly measured ... hmm ... by forces, and the friendly atmosphere was relegated to the background. In the ""Guardians of the galaxy"", things are different: the characters are so different that they have nothing to compete with. This five of the losers (and they call themselves that) form a real friendly union, which more than ever realizes the principle ""We are different, but we are together.""In connection with the above, it makes sense to mention the work of a stunning cast of actors. Chris Pratt creates a very bright character who can compete with his own charisma, even with Tony Stark himself. It's amazing that I did not pay attention to this actor before: after watching, I was surprised to find that I already watched a dozen films with his participation. Now I will follow with interest the development of his career. Zoe Saldana confirms the status of the most unearthly actress of our time, adding to her track record a new alien image of the charming and daring Gamora. Professional wrestler Dave Batista is very organic in his role. I think he definitely has a future in the film industry. Very pleased with such venerable professionals of their business as Benicio Del Toro, Glenn Close and John Ci Riley, although, not soon, that these fantastic actors would like to see on the screen a little more.
Rocket Raccoon is also a rocket (or for many of the fair sex - milash raccoon) - this is the main bomb of the whole film. I can not appreciate the work of Bradley Cooper, since I watched the film in Russian dubbing (which, by the way, is also surprisingly very good). But the character is simply amazing! The hall came in a raging rapture, it cost the raccoon only to appear on the screen. Definitely, this is a find without which this film would not have been so successful. Spectator love was won by another character - Grut (or, again, for many girls and children - just a Tree). By the way, the incredibly laborious work of Vin Diesel on the voice acting of this character you can appreciate in Russian dubbing.4. Bright special effects. What to say, the film is bright, very beautiful and voluminous. A real holiday for the eyes, on which it is worth to fork out, in order to appreciate all this beauty in IMAX 3D.5. Music! Even if the film leaves you absolutely indifferent, then the music just needs to please you. The creators of the ribbon collected just the cream, the quintessential culture of the 70s, choosing bright, favorite, but un-played tracks. I was really pleased to share some of this amazing culture with my friends who, outside of this movie, would not for anything agree to listen to ""this is not necessary for old people"".TOTAL. ""Guardians of the galaxy"" is a completely crazy blockbuster that charges the audience with a positive and undoubtedly captivates with an incredibly warm atmosphere, exciting plot, bright special effects, killer jokes and a genuine team spirit. For the first time in a very long time, I felt this naive childlike feeling: I did not want to leave the cinema and leave this amazing, incredibly convincing and soulful world, which was given to us by the creators of the ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Probably, this is the first blockbuster this year, which I will want to reconsider. And this is the rare film that I want to assess neither from the point of view of a critic who cares at trifles and searches for story inconsistencies, but from the point of view of the viewer who can easily be bribed by a talking raccoon and a smiling tree.
That's why I highly recommend watching this movie literally to all viewers. And that's why ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" is becoming a movie that I without any qualms of conscience put an unprecedented 9 points, which I have not been awarded with yet another film from the universe I adore Marvel.Enjoy watching!"

",0.144,0.9867,2018-05-23 00:00:00,8,"I had some misgivings about this film when I first heard about it. A gang of intergalactic superheroes that could give our main characters from Star Wars a run for their money. But after watching it, I can honestly say it's one of my new favorite superhero movies. Plus, this was my first Chris Pratt film. He is now my new favorite actor. He's smart, funny, interesting, and good-looking. He's been in some movies I really enjoyed. He should get more roles. Anyway, back to the movie. The crew was cool too, especially Rocket Raccoon; so smart-mouthed and belligerent. Story, acting, effects, comedy, and suspense all in one! It's not a bad composite film. But you don't have to agree with me. Just be your own critic and see for yourself."
" It reminded me of too many movies.
",0.0,-0.2828,2018-05-21 00:00:00,6,"Guardians of the Galaxy had some cool action scenes and laughs, but felt too familiar to other superhero movies and space movies. I didn't care for the story or most of the characters except Groot and the raccoon. Although, they still felt like comic sidekicks like other movies. The story was the same repetitive concept of a device that is used to destroy the world and gets stolen from the villains like the evil ring in LOTR. It didn't feel like it's own superhero movie. When I watch those kinds of movies, I usually love them because they feel like their own story/world, but this felt like all of those movies combined."
" Marvel's space opera is a win.
",0.5859,0.9986,2018-05-15 00:00:00,9,"Marvel Studios brings a fun and humorous, yet emotional space opera to the big screen. With stunning action sequences, great character depth and an fitting score, Guardians of the galaxy (directed by James Gunn) is nicely told and keeps me very optimistic for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring in the film is Chris Pratt (gun-slinging scavenger Peter Quill), Zoe Saldana (the deadliest woman in the galaxy), Bradley Cooper (loudmouth raccoon), Vin Diesel (friendly walking tree), and Dave Bautista (Drax the beastly, yet somber destroyer).What's great about this movie, is that beyond the action and the spaceships and gags, it's all about the team and the dynamic between each character. Every member of the team has a moment to shine and a hell of a lot of humor to provide for our comedic hunger (this film is full of well-executed quips). Jokes aside, we're actually given a reason to understand and relate to each of these characters and their motives within the plot as we're driven into their backstories briefly but wisely. Not only does this give us a good understanding of everyone without spending 30 minutes on each character, but leaves room for more development in future storytelling. Speaking of time, at 2 hours and 1 minute the pace of the film moves along nicely and never feels like its dragging along or being rushed to the finished line. The plot itself is fairly simple, but serves well for character development. The villain has an understandable motive although his overall plan feels a little generic, which is unfortunate as I think Lee Pace plays the part well.The film is filled with wonderous set pieces and locations that feel as if they've lept from the pages of a comic book on LSD, and they are a complete joy to take in. The action is just terrific in all ways you could hope for in a space opera. If you're a fan of explosions, spaceship battles and godly cosmic powers, you'll feel right at home. The diversity and creativity in different alien species and races are also on par with that of Star Wars. Of course, none of this could be achieved without the impressive use of both practical and visual effects, which come together to paint a bright and attractive aesthetic for the movie.One of the best decisions James Gunn made for this film was to include a 70's inspired soundtrack. Each song is perfectly matched with the scene its played in, the two complement each other and further add to the unique feel of the film. More importantly, the soundtrack showed me a side of music I never knew I enjoyed, I now listen to said soundtrack all the time. When a film's music moves me personally, that's enough to tell me it's perfect.I'm really glad Marvel decided to hire James Gunn and let him pursue and perfectly execute his vision. Because what we as an audience receive is far beyond a masterpiece of entertaining cinema. Guardians of the galaxy is up there as one of the best comic book movies of all time, for me personally. You'll be laughing, cheering, maybe even sobbing. Regardless, definitely a very enjoyable flick and well-directed film in its own right. Must see."

That movie definitely copies certain degree of sense of humor from Guardians of the Galaxy (GG) but no way beyond ( plz don't say it didn't), but people rated GG at 8!! Now after a long while people finally start to rectify the rating for Ragnarok to 7.9, umm... fair enough. Because I'll certainly doubt IMDB rating system forever if R keeps its rating higher than GG. I have to say that the OST in GG is already worth an 8. Personally I've been listening since I watched it for the first time. Is that album epic?! I mean when he whole tone of marvel goes rather modern(Ironman) or boring historic(Thor), the director of GG showed you another possibility of Marvel movie- nostalgias 1970/1980s fun! While you watch those hilarious Garbage of the Galaxy, oh no, Guardians of the Galaxy, didn't you feel it is such a different kind of show way for Marvel? Talented, creative, and fresh!!!While, though now the rating is 8.1 here, I still wanna say thank you to the director that he chose such a unique way to show Marvel comics. Though the GG2 isn't as good as GG1, I'll still be a solid supporter for this series. And I'll buy the album for sure :)"

Nothing in this movie is forced, everything is going on so smoothly, with a positive and fun atmosphere, but emotional and sad at periods in the same time. All the protagonists have deeply worked characters with a special bond and chemistry between them, all united for the same reason against the same villain. The visuals are over the top, maybe some of the best I've ever seen with a beatufiul sci-fi city environment and a beautiful galaxy. To be real, the story is a bit blank, it is nothing special, but it goes according to the comics, so no hard feelings there."

Guardians of the Galaxy is as colorful as it is well made.

" Top Tier MCU Film
",0.2023,0.9542,2018-04-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie was so well done because it was superheroes I didn't even know existed like many casual comic book fans. When that first trailer dropped with the five Guardians standing in line like straight out of The Usual Suspects, I found myself excited for these character I didn't know. This launched Guardians Of The Galaxy into household names. I recently revisited this film and it's just as good on the second viewing. It's a funny, action packed thrill ride from beginning to end with arguably the best movie soundtrack of all time. This film is masterfully done and has us not only connect with the characters in a few hours, but really feel like they're family by the end; which is really hard to do in the limited time of a film. The chemistry is about as good as it gets and I hope for many more films - as long as they keep their quality."
" Worst film ever?
",-0.6249,-0.902,2018-04-18 00:00:00,1,"It's a sci-fi, but the effects, costumes and characters are terribly made and poorly animated. It's (supposed to be) humorous, but it is not funny at all. Of all the sci-fis I have seen this is just a complete mish-mash of poor story lines and really bad effects. On top of that, the movie takes forever to get going. Also, it seems that the director has tried to take a bit of every scene from every dystopic sci-fi ever made and mix it to into a new film, but the truth is that the characters comes across as flat and and in-credible. Stay away from this!"

When a film combines action, adventure, comedy, emotion, nostalgic, fantasy among many other traits; it produces an experience not soon forgotten. I wouldn't categorize this movie as a super hero movie and I believe that is a trait that has this movie resonating with so many of it's viewers; it's relatable fantasy as I like to refer to it.For those considering to embark on a cinematic adventure; keep this title in mind. I hope you have the opportunity to experience this film.May the guardians be with you :)"
" Another Great movie by Marvel following a unique gang of characters and a fantastic story
",0.8885,0.9981,2018-04-06 00:00:00,9,"Guardians of the Galaxy stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradly Cooper, and Vin Diesel as they form together to defeat the terrible Ronan who is trying to destroy the universe with an infinity stone. And this movie is nearly flawless and stands up to even The Avengers with its team forming comic book mashup. Now legendary writer and director James Gunn wrote this fantastic script that fits every actor perfectly. With Quill being so sarcastic yet heroic in this film in all the wrong ways. Drax with his lack of understanding metaphors and is great comedy of stating everything as bluntly as possible. Rocket with his hilarious sarcasm and big mouth with his amazing jokes about his height and species. And of course groot being the most lovable character in the MCU to date with his small vocabulary and big heart. And even with the writing the smaller characters and with its perfect balance of comedy to story telling makes the script a very enjoyable part of the film. Directing wise Gunn did an amazing job with the direction making this film feel so far away from the MCU but so relevant and relatable and familiar at the same time. Having some fantastic scenes like the final battle scene and the jail scene makes this film so memorable and fun and makes you guessing till the end on what will happen. The acting all around is amazing as well. Pratt as star Lord is one of the best casting since Robert Downing Jr. As iron man. And with the equally great voice acting by Cooper and Diesel makes it almost forgettable that they voiced them. And with the amazing make up on Rooker, Baitista, and Saldana makes them recognisable and makes them as characters fun and fills the screen with joy. This movie is a great film to add to the MCU and one of the most memorable for its lines and scenes with fantastic characters and a great plot. Guardians of the Galaxy gets a 9.25/10"
" A worthy introduction to the Guardians of the galaxy
",0.4404,0.9324,2018-04-04 00:00:00,9,"Guardians of the galaxy is one of my favourite MCU films and it got me into MCU. Believe it or not before I ever watched Guardians of the galaxy I literally had no interest in Marvel or even the Cinematic Universe but after this movie that all changed. 
The acting was very good especially from Chris Pratt (Star Lord), Michael Rooker (Youndu), Bradley Cooper (Rocket Racoon), Vin Diseal (Groot), who ever was Drax and Zoe (Gamora).No spoilers for any plot details but it is definitely an entertaining film. I would defintly check it before watching Vol.2."
" A Fun Caper
",0.5106,0.9877,2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Having finally gotten round to watching Guardians of the Galaxy four years after it was released, it was an overall enjoyable experience. James Gunn embraced the zany nature of the comics fully which made for a very gratifying watch. The film's breakneck pace certainly helped the narrative flow effectively whilst never giving us a dull moment.The overall aesthetic was bright, colourful and visually-pleasing, whilst the incorporation of pop songs from the 70s and 80s in certain scenes was inventive. One of the best aspects however, was the dynamic between the Guardians and how that developed over the course of the narrative. The action scenes were also quite inventive and engaging, whilst the humour was surprisingly irreverent and witty.However, some minor gripes I have include the rather thin characterisation from nearly all the characters aside from Star Lord, who gave the film a much needed emotional core, as well as the actual plot being rather uninspired (all the characters are trying to obtain an all-powerful MacGuffin in one of the Infinity Stones). The villain of Ronan also seemed uninspired with predictable motivations, although he was more interesting given he was a understudy to Thanos although that was only briefly explored in a few scenes.In the end this was a very fun watch and I'll look forward to viewing the sequel."

" I am hooked for life to Guardians of the Galaxy
",0.0,0.9964,2018-03-28 00:00:00,10,I am all about comics. I started reading every Spider Man when it cam out starting around issue number 47. I mention comics all over all my Radman_art and Radmanart websites since 2001; when my wife made my first website. The title of my websites refer to a super hero I invented in 1988 and had published in Thrasher Magazine. My splash page for my radmanart2ndhome.blogspot.com web site is of the issue Radman was published in. In all my newspaper articles praising my art; I am referred to as Radman. I created about 150 pages of comics back in my heyday's of the late 1980's. I have drawn the Guardians of the Galaxy's charatcter Rocket many times to perfection on my Radman_Art Blog Homepage 2016 page. I liked to draw Rocket because he is my favorite super hero of all time now. I love his New England accent. I never new I would have a raccoon as a favorite superhero. The point I am trying to make is I am all about comics. Until the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie I had never even heard of Guardians of the Galaxy. Weird huh? Pretty weird coming from a comic authority that I claim to be. Since then Guardians of the Galaxy has become my favorite super hero saga and will be for life.The amazing thing to me is Guardians of the Galaxy first began in the epic year of 1969. Probably the coolest year our country ever had. Say's Wikipedia: The original Guardians of the Galaxy are a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Guardians first appear in Marvel Super-Heroes #18.You have to admit that is pretty weird. Long live Guardians of the Galaxy!

I liked some of the characters, and I'm glad there was a ""happy"" ending, but I didn't understand how quickly the relationship between the green lady (Gomorrah?) and Chris Pratt developed. It was almost too easy for her to go from bad guy to good guy. That plot should've been longer. Might watch again in the future."

Bradley Cooper really pulled it off - he DID have the best part - by the end of the pic, Rocket even looked like Bradley. My only problems were the Godfather-like prothestic on Lee Pace, & I love Lee Pace, and the humor was a little predictable at times, but all in all, entertaining."
" Guardians of the Galaxy is beast!!!!
",0.0,0.9957,2018-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Guardians of the Galaxies is one of the best movies ever I personally have every seen. It has many humorous, action-fixed, and emotional scenes. All of the characters in this movie have their own interesting personalities, which makes the production more appealing. 
 First off, the rating of this movie is PG-13, so it is mainly targeting the teenage group of people. My reaction from seeing first snapshot of the movie being released. I thought that this was going to be a nerdy science fiction movie. All I saw were these strange characters: a green alien woman, followed by blue one with glowing red hair, a raccoon, and a tree like figure. The extraterrestrial beings did not appeal to me: Gamora, Yondu, Drax, and Groot. Just to put this out there, I am not much of a movie watcher. I do not venture out to civilization that much. Without the strong encouragement from my friends, I probably would have stayed home and would have done nothing. Walking into the movie theatre, I thought that this movie was going to be so lame because prior to this experience I had not watched any Marvel Produced movies, so I had no idea how good this movie would be. On a side note, I now love Marvel because due to their wealth of success in recent years.
 The element of this movie that reached out to me the most were the songs because they are still really catchy and throw back like. On Spotify, I have added so many Guardians of the Galaxies sound track music to my playlist. Songs such as ""Hooked on a Feeling,"" ""Brandy, You are a Fine Girl,"" and ""Blue Sky"" are songs I listen to on a regular basis. In my opinion, the audience will definitely fall in love with these songs.
 Another cool aspect of this movie is the futuristic space portion. It showed us what it would be like if we lived on different planets and could travel between them using space ships. We see different type of other beings with different physical appearances than human beings. This movie features a possibility for the future if our technology can advance that far. 
 Personally, I think I have a huge sense of humor. There were so many hilarious scenes that attracted my attention. In those scenes, the characters use sarcasm something the audience is very accustomed to. From the bickering between Rocket and Peter Quill to Drax's very literal understanding, I had a great time enjoying the movie. 
 This movie covers three of the persuasive elements: ethos, logos, and pathos (mostly pathos). The heroes in the story do ethically the correct thing at the end by saving the universe, which makes them perceived as heroes. Many young adolescents look up to and admire heroes. The logical part of this movie is how the group of guardians figure out a way to defeat Ronan. Pathos is everywhere with the humor.
 Overall, I would give this movie a 10 stars out 10 for its awesomeness. 
To @moviecasualenthusiast and your lame review
Where can you even start? First off, your name is the movie casual enthusiast. So, why are you even criticizing this movie if you're an enthusiast. Don't put that as your username if you're not going to be enthusiastic for movie. Your username should be ""Comments that no one cares about."" Are you serious about a 10 year old child being capable of writing a multimillionaire production? You must come from a different planet if that is possible. I bet when you were 10 years old, you didn't even know how to write your name. If everything was so predictable, please tell me that you knew Yondu was going to die. You couldn't predict that. If you thought the acting was weak, then you're downgrading the whole Marvel organization. They would've picked the most qualified actors to fulfill their parts correctly. If there was only unintelligent humor, then that means you did not laugh at all watching the movie. Please tell me that you didn't laugh at all, so that I can expose you for being a robot and turn you into the government. The movie can't only have intelligent humor or else not everyone would understand the jokes such as yourself. If you are truly a big fan of Marvel, then you would accept that this movie was awesome. This just proves to show that you are not a true fan and a hater. Next time, just stay home and work on your elements of persuasion."

Now, this is not unexpected overstuffing in front of my eyes, so I was ready for it. But the character developments here that connected perfectly with the sequel was astonishing because when I saw the sequel I thought the continuity of characters wasn't really right but I stand corrected. Even through the actions of the characters, there are subtle moments that make their transitions in the sequel perfect."

Their goal about this threat is to stop it from taking control of the universe and destroy it. So, this group of intergalactic criminals known as the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" will try to save the world.I liked this movie very much, it was funny, interesting and with a very well-written script. I enjoyed it because it was also very different from all the other Marvel movies and I believe that's the reason why for a lot of people it is considered as one of the best movies of Marvel. In addition to this, it has to be mentioned that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" combines very well the visual effects with soundtracks, and fight scenes with emotional and funny moments, something that is very difficult to be successfully combined. I have also to say that I really liked the interpretations of Chris Pratt who played as Peter Quill / Starlord, Zoe Saldana who played as Gamora and Dave Bautista who played as Drax. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michael Rooker's who played as Yondu Udonta and John C. Reilly's who played as Corpsman Dey. The direction which was made by James Gunn was simply outstanding and I believe that was the most important reason why this film is so good.Finally, I think that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is simply a masterpiece of Marvel and you will understand it after watching it. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you will have a great time, it will keep you intense and you are going to enjoy it very much."

" How Marvel Studios' biggest gamble turned out to be one of its most beloved outings.
",0.7501,0.9963,2018-02-27 00:00:00,10,"When Marvel Studios first announced that they would be making a film based on the Guardians of the Galaxy, most people reacted the same way that the character Korath does in the film when told about Peter Quill's nickname of Star-lord... ""Who?"" Yes, the Guardians of the Galaxy were such an obscure group back then that I bet even some hardcore comic book fans were unfamiliar with them at the time. But nowadays, EVERYONE knows who the Guardians are and that's thanks to writer/director James Gunn's phenomenal efforts in crafting a super fun entry in the superhero genre.'Guardians of the Galaxy' boasts some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most lavish visuals, and they are paired with some solid action sequences. And like any great MCU film, the screenplay is full of great bits of humorous dialogue, some of which even push the boundaries for a family-friendly MCU film released under the Disney banner (e.g. the Jackson Pollack joke; need I say more?). But amidst all of that, the film also boasts plenty of heart. You will become emotionally attached to a group of 'outlaws' that consist of a dance-loving human scavenger, a green-skinned alien assassin, a violence-happy warrior who doesn't understand metaphors all that well, a talking raccoon with a short temper, and a good-natured tree creature who can only say three words. So thanks to this, along with some great emotional poignancy, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1' proved that Marvel Studios was more than capable of producing high-quality feature films based around lesser-known characters."

" Fun and frantic - with a fantastic soundtrack - and ""I am Groot""!
",0.6476,0.9941,2018-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Firstly, you don't need to be a huge comics fan or know anything about the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' going in to this to enjoy it. Even though I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, I still knew very little about the Guardians, but had heaps of fun with the film anyway. It's a pretty simple concept - a boy, Peter Quill (Pratt) is taken from Earth by one of the spacefaring races that exist in the Marvel Universe, grows up as a Han Solo-esque outlaw calling himself 'Star Lord' travelling/thieving around the galaxy. He steals the wrong thing (an orb) and gets involved in a galactic power struggle which forces him to work together with Gamora (Saldana), Rocket (Cooper), Groot (Vin Diesel in his best role ever!) and Drax (Bautista). Action and adventure ensue!The bad guy, Ronan (Pace), is a Kree that wants to wipe out the plant Xandar - no real reason why he hates the Xandarians, he just does! - and Thanos (who we saw at the end of 'The Avengers') is going to help him, once he gets the orb. It sounds complicated - and we haven't seen any Skrulls or Shi'ar yet! - but the film doesn't really get too bogged down in galactic politics or grudges. However, it sets up the potential for a huge 'The Avengers 3' or the new 'Fantastic Four'.One of the best bits is that Quill was abducted in 1988, so the only cassette he has is full of 70's & 80's music, meaning he knows nothing else and the film does a great job of throwing in catchy, but not necessarily huge, pop songs throughout - Bowie, 10cc, Blue Swede, Joan Jett, Marvin Gaye... The audio makes everything fun and provides a nice contrast to the aliens/space battles going on in the visuals!So, when Quill and his team of misfits - so many 'Star Wars' comparisons (a good thing!), including Thanos appearing as a hologram to Ronan - decide to do something good with their lives and join forces with the Xandarian ""Nova Corps"" (although, no sign of Nova the character) to stop Ronan. There's a huge/exciting battle and final scene.Plenty of laughs throughout, mostly thanks to Pratt & Cooper and the film never gets bogged down in too much seriousness, or the darkness/evil of the villains. Loads of eye-popping action and lots of cameos/support actors adding to the overall ""big galaxy"" feel. The Groot scene near the end is spectacular and the post end credits scene is a pretty great inside joke."
" Unique Blend of Laughter, Action and Anticipation
",0.5574,0.9044,2017-12-30 00:00:00,9,"Marvel's incredible feat of producing a cinematic universe which dwarfs the likes of Harry Potter and The Lord of The Rings has revived the comic-book world. Although not all Marvel films can be deemed unmissable, this 2014 addition to their 'movie-arsenal' is a must-see for those looking for action and humour.A soundtrack based off 1980s songs provides an memorable theme to James Gunn's adaptation of Marvel's less well known comic books series. Nonetheless. Gunn's gamble of producing characters that are not your usual comic-book superheroes has paid off.Chris Pratt stars as the extra-terrestrial human being, Peter Quill, aka 'Star Lord' alongside Dave Bautista's introduction into Hollywood as the lovable character of Drax. Along with the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, Gunn sees the ensemble of a strange group of outcasts who battle their way across the galaxy in a situation they did not want to be in. All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy is a movie that resembles many others before it but provides a unique, hilarious twist of the concept of 'superheroes'. And despite a rather lacklustre villain who could have done with some more lines, Gunn more than makes up for it by creating an addicting chemistry between the main characters.With audiences now in anticipation of a new film, Guardians of the Galaxy has done well to capture the awe of even those who are not keen on the superhero genre."
" A very short review of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014)
",0.0,0.9807,2017-12-26 00:00:00,8,"I had fun with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). I'd rate it an 8 out of 10, if a little grudgingly. For me, it started quite strong with its introduction of Chris Pratt's roguish space antihero; I actually had no idea he could be this funny. (I've only seen him once before, weighed down by the failed comedic scripting of 2015's ""Jurassic World."")I'm sorry to say that my interest in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" waned just a bit as it subsequently unfolded as a cartoonish, relatively tame, family-friendly adventure - complete with a heartwarming value-of-friendship lesson. That's fine, I guess - it's cool and it makes sense that the Marvel Cinematic Universe should offer films more appropriate for younger viewers. Can you imagine, however, how hilarious this movie would be if it truly deserved its (befuddling) PG-13 rating, and really pressed the envelope? Between Pratt's wit and these offbeat character concepts, it would be amazing.I still had fun with this, though, thanks mainly to the action and the impressive special effects. I'd recommend it, and I'm planning on seeing the sequel.Postscript - people are saying that this is the MCU's answer to ""Star Wars,"" and I suppose it could be. But I had a lot more fun thinking that the movie was channeling Harry Harrison's priceless science fiction book series featuring criminal-antiheroes - the ""Stainless Steel Rat"" adventures."
" Relevant Plot and Excellent Introduction
",0.5719,-0.836,2017-12-20 00:00:00,8,"The first time I saw this movie, I had a dislike for Chris Pratt and let it affect this movie for me. However, I have looked passed that dislike and watched the movie over again.The way the movie brings the Guardians together is well done and is relevant to the plot line as well. The gathering of the Guardians begins in the prison after fighting over the orb. The misfits put their brains together and make a good team in the end, defeating the enemy sent by Thanos. There are many important factors to the MCU in this movie that is sadly abandoned in the sequel. Excellent introduction to the Guardians and in my opinion, has re-watch value and suitable for most action/superhero fans"

I was super excited to see the movie when I came out in late July 2014 and when I finally saw the movie I was highly disappointed, because the movie was too depressing.I never laughed but everyone else did, my whole family was laughing and were talking about it like crazily and I was in the back of the car all quite because I never found it funny. I hated it the stuff with the mom was just weird and came out of nowhere. And other stuff just annoyed me and just bothered me.Honestly I hated it and that's why I liked the sequel so much compared to this one cause Guardians of the Galaxy 2 actually made me laugh.

Above all it remembers to employ the all too often forgotten art of storytelling. It is one of the best films in the Marvel cinematic universe, which was already leaving its DC rivals behind a little before this film was released. Guardians of the Galaxy will never be serious sci-fi, but it is a welcome move away from the american obsession with superheros - even though it is a superhero movie of sorts, it is an ensemble cast story which sees every character as different, unique and important rather than placing all the specialness on one or two characters.There are too many good performances to describe in detail here, but I think it's important to mention two;
1. This is the first movie where we see what Chris Pratt has offer the big screen. 
2. Oddly, this is possibly the best performance we have ever seen from Vin Diesel.Go watch it, it's fun :)"

",0.9217,0.9986,2017-11-12 00:00:00,10,"Prior to their 2014 film, the Guardians of the Galaxy were not household names. But after the surprise success of this film, the heroes were catapulted to stardom. I was a skeptic prior to watching Guardians, however watching this film was some of the most enjoyment I've ever got from a cinematic experience. A unique concoction of sci-fi, humour and the superhero genre, James Gunn has crafted one of the best superhero films to date, one that isn't afraid to take itself too seriously. The direction from Gunn is stylish, and his script charming and heartfelt. The way he juggles humorous moments with emotional punches and action scenes with exposition is remarkable. The cast is on point; perhaps one of the best ensembles in a superhero movie. Chris Pratt is an inspired choice as Star Lord, and is delightful throughout. Zoe Saldana makes a convincing Gamora, and Karen Gillian gives a solid performance as her sister Nebula. Drax the destroyer (Dave Bautista) is instantly likable, and Benicia Del Torro makes a very passable alien as the collector. There's even recognized star power in the form of voice actors Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, portraying lovable duo Rocket Racoon and Groot (who can only say the words ""I am Groot"" and is still easy to adore). Other performances such as Michael Rooker as Yondu are well done, but if there is a weakness in the film then it's the villain Ronan (Lee Pace), who lacks character development. The story arcs aside from Ronan are excellently done, and the music and soundtrack are brilliantly chosen (as they are in the sequel). Spectacle is also incredible, and the special effects and CGI convincing. Overall, Guardians impressed me very much, and I highly recommend you see it, for the brilliant performances, story lines and direction."
" Painfully average
",-0.5267,0.986,2017-10-27 00:00:00,6,"I often use IMDb as a guideline for movies before I watch them. Any movie that scores below 6 is usually not worth watching, 6-7 is where most Hollywood blockbusters land, it's the popular zone. 7-8 is a good movie, and 8-10 is usually VERY good up to instant classic. I can safely say that this movie does not deserve anything over 6.5It's not a bad movie, it's just not good either. It's just a generic superhero movie. I can accept that the story is silly and often makes little to no sense, with causality holes and lack of depth. After all, it's just a superhero movie. But the characters aren't particularly interesting either. They're boring and stereotypical (in a bad way), and while they try to be humorous all the time, their jokes feel forced and, honestly, quite lame. The actors aren't bad, and the voice-overs for the walking rodent and the living tree are good, but that's just not enough to lift an entire movie up from the muck into which it dug itself.The CGI is well made, but still visibly CGI, and in a couple of years we will probably (as seems to be the case with all CGI movies) look back and laugh at how bad the technology was back in 2014.If you like a superhero action flick, and if you're into heavy CGI and more interested in eyegasm than plot, go watch the movie. As I said, it's not bad. It's just... painfully average."
" A forced action-comedy
",-0.4588,0.7247,2017-10-05 00:00:00,7,"After getting caught and arrested, a group of bounty hunters must protect a sacred sphere which grants immense power to the one who can ""wield"" it. They must fight against a maniacal character who's determined to destroy the entire race once he's in possession of the most wanted object in the galaxy.It's a movie full of action, fights and explosions which, unfortunately, has two major flaws. It is too superficial and simplistic in terms of story, thus being predictable, and, although it is featured as an action/adventure movie, it desperately tries to make you laugh, a lot more than many full-fledged comedies, with many forced scenes and dialogues. As it happens most of the time when you try too hard to be funny, you get a movie which actually isn't, or by far not as much as it wanted to be. Instead, they should have focused to create a serious movie with a solid story and some better thought dialogue which would have been a lot more enjoyable, at least for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with some interesting characters and some spectacular visuals, but gets dragged down by some aspects which shouldn't have been there in the first place."

" Guardians of the Galaxy is delightful, thrilling, well paced, visually astonishing and stunning film.
",0.891,0.9931,2017-09-26 00:00:00,9,"Guardians of the Galaxy: Movie Review. Guardians of the Galaxy is another one of the solid and best entry to Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film has strong charismatic and compelling performances and impressive direction. The plot and story structure of the film is touching and refreshing. The humour in the film feels genuinely realistic, gripping and convincing. The characters are very well developed and have emotional depth and intensity. The cast is great and the performances are amazing. Sound track and musical score of the film is phenomenal and top notch. Characterisation of Rocket and Groot is brilliant. The movie looks visually beautiful and spectacle. The visual effects of the film are spectacular and dazzling and stylish tone of the film feels very highly creative, artistic, and imaginative. Character Design of non human characters are exceptionally remarkable and fascinating. Cinematography of the film is fantastic. Action Sequences are fast paced, epic, breathtaking, and very well shot. The direction and the directing style of James Gunn is excellent. The performances are great. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, they are all amazing in their respective characters. Rest of the supporting cast and characters are also good.The film seems little overstuffed with unnecessary elements and sub plots. The film has weak and underdeveloped villain character. Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser has tried hard to deliver, but his character is very underutilized. All over, Guardians of the Galaxy is an entertaining Marvel film.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."

I love the Star Wars feel this movie has5. The songsWhat I didn't like1. It is tied to MCU, so there is of course a million references to the other moviesOverall this is a good movie and I really do enjoy it, but I feel like it should have been away from the MCU if it wanted to be at the top of its possible value. Instead we have a good movie that is tied down to the insane bondings of the other movies in this now trite universe."

This film has zero depth, like intentionally, they dumbed it down on purpose. The sense of humor is corny as hell. The characters behavior was so dubious it was impossible for me to relate. The story was just weird and secondhand. I have no idea what is good in this film besides CGI. Maybe it's the fact that it's the ""hero"" movie where instead of some deep complex ""perfect"" character we have a bunch of misfits with plain problems and lots of flaws. Relatable, right? Other than that I don't have a clue."

" This was unexpectedly bad.
",-0.5423,-0.782,2017-09-07 00:00:00,4,"Looking at the high IMDb rating I was surprised how bad the movie actually is.Some masked man struts down an abandoned planet, turns out to be the good guy. Scene turns into music and dancing, alright this movie isn't taking itself too seriously. All is fine so far, after all, some of the other Marvel movies are pretty dark so maybe this will turn out well.But it all went down hill from there. The jokes just get worse and worse. And the ""hero""? The kid from the intro that watched his mother die but refused to take her hand is supposedly some kind of Han Solo type of character? Why should we care, when he is so goofy all the time, never taking anything seriously? This is a complete 180 degree turn from the intro scene. There is no connection, and the character doesn't feel credible at all.The point when the movie died for me was when the ""hero"" and the raccoon joke about black lights and semen while watching Zoe Saldana's swaying butt disappear up the stair... wtf? I cringed so hard... and the same goes for most of the jokes in the movie; they are misplaced and stupid to the point were you get the impression that the writers just added poor jokes to compensate for poor writing.What I did like about the movie: The tree-man (Groot?), because he had a heart. The rest of the cast is a mess. Also the special effects looked pretty good, even though it's still just generic 3D Hollywood trashfood."

The whole movie built up to a dead end and you can see the exact way the film will end within the first 30 mins.

This movie is nonstop action, from the space heroes fighting bad guys left and right to the incredible firepower of each character. This movie also has nonstop comic relief - tastefully done and not overexerted. The acting is spot-on with just the right balance of drama and humor. I especially liked the character development grew between the five mismatched heroes. There is plenty of decent and spectacular special effects to highlight the tension in the plot. The movie is a little high on the CGI, but, the graphics were beautiful and blends in well with the visual effects It's a superhero film with loads of fun.Grade A-"
" ""I'm a warrior, an assassin. I don't dance.""
",0.0,0.9976,2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"I'm coming late to The Guardians of the Galaxy party, but boy am I glad I finally made it. What an absolutely blast of a movie. I had so much fun with this one. Everything works. The special effects are amazing. There was a time when CGI characters looked dark and not terribly convincing. How far has technology come? The action is non-stop with plenty of explosions, fight scenes, and other general craziness. It's a well-paced thrill ride that rarely slows for a breath. That's not to say there's not a story here, because there is. Guardians of the Galaxy does as much to advance the larger MCU plot line as any film Marvel has put out. As with the other Marvel movies, Guardians of the Galaxy features a lot of funny bits. The comedy never felt forced (thankfully). Instead, it has that organic feel to it that all good comedy has. The acting is another high spot. Chris Pratt is tremendous in the lead. I can't say enough about how good he is. Underneath all that green make-up, Zoe Saldana gives a fantastic, multi-layered performance (Did I really just wrote that?). But my favorite has to be Dave Bautista as Drax. When I first read he was being cast in a large role, I was worried. His acting really surprised me. He plays Drax like an actor with years of experience. His deadpan delivery was perfect. Very nice job all the way around. I'm going to give this one a very, very strong 8/10 - and I predict I'll raise that after I watch it again."

" The biggest idiots in the galaxy
",0.0,0.9941,2017-08-02 00:00:00,9,"Marvel Studios can do practically anything when they made a great movie about a superpowered team that almost no one knew, featuring a humanoid tree and a talking raccoon, that turned these characters into household names and a global phenomenon. It's not without it's flaws, but the good parts in this movie are just superb.The cast in this movie is pretty much perfect. Chris Pratt is a Han Solo-type hero that won the hearts of all. Bradley Cooper, the voice of Rocket, made a small rodent (don't call him that!) humorous, likable and sympathetic. Vin Diesel, the voice of Groot, said only five words in this entire movie and yet Groot was adorable, brutal and innocent throughout this entire movie. Dave Batista is the breakout star in this film as a big brute, who doesn't understand sarcasm or metaphors yet somehow can bring humor and is easily understandable as a man wanting vengeance for the murder of his wife and daughter. Zoe Saldana, who played Gamora, was probably the weakest (not physically) of the Guardians, not that she was bad, just that everyone else was so well done. She has an incredible backstory, being the adopted daughter turned assassin of Thanos, the big bad in the MCU. She still brought something great to the character she just wasn't as relatable or likable as the others but still is a good character. The side characters like Yondu, Dey, and Nebula were also good as characters that brought a lot to the movie and look like they are going to be in the sequels.The humor in this movie is spot on too, with each Guardian having great lines and moments and even side characters making people laugh. No one in this film is as big a star as the soundtrack. The mashup of infamous 70s and 80s music, helps establish the plot and characters. It even became a best selling album worldwide, with no new song on it. The action in this film is spectacular too, from the stunt choreography to the visual effects like space battles and fights involving Groot and Rocket.The major flaw in this movie is the villain, Ronan, played by Lee Pace. Ronan's character and backstory is fairly established as an angry Kree who doesn't agree with a peace treaty. Except he doesn't change, show different sides of his character and most of all, was ultimately defeated in a dance battle. Sure, it was funny, but still, you get easily distracted by some human's pelvic sorcery? Just ignore that and use your weapon. You don't need the last word because your action will be louder.However, the everything else in the movie like characters, action, humor, soundtrack, writing, was so good that it makes up for how boring Ronan was.+ Guardians and side character performances + Soundtrack + Writing and humor, able to deliver on emotional moments too + Action and effects - Villain was blandFinal Score: 9.3/10"

So happy to see more of Chris Pratt as he is one of my absolute favorite actors of all time (loved him in Parks and Recreations). I enjoyed the story but also the humor that only Marvel knows how to add. I absolutely love that Marvel knows how to have a very serious and intriguing story but at the same time they know when and how to add a few laughs. Really well done, both by the actors, the animators and the story writers. Great team and I can't wait to see more of the Guardians of the Galaxy, whether it is in Infinity War or a third one!"

" Even for non-fanboys, Worth one viewing in a theater due to solid characters, jokes, music
",0.5423,0.9076,2017-07-16 00:00:00,8,"1. One of those rare 'comic book' movies where you can get into it even though SciFi is not your thing, and you have no idea what the world is about. This is because the character arc of the hero is well developed, the camaraderie of the heroes are strong and interesting, the jokes funny, and the music good. 2. For non-fanboys, perhaps not worth watching again, but certainly worth the movie ticket to go see. It's one of those few movies where you start to get into the story more as it progresses, rooting more for the hero as the finale approaches. 3.

It hurts like he!!, until you sit back and relax...then it just aches a bit, until you get used to the watching...Oh, there is a story of sorts, but it is buried deeply within all the fast paced action.

" Not as good as I expected
",-0.3412,-0.2045,2017-07-08 00:00:00,6,"I think that Guardians of the Galaxy is far too overrated. It just your typical Marvel film, nothing special, but nothing too bad. It is made out to be some sort of masterpiece, when in reality, it really isn't that good. The story line was okay, but it's just another interpenetration of a typical sci-fi story. However, I did enjoy the scene in which they break out of the space prison. I thought that the space battle near the end was average, I've seen a lot better e.g. Star Wars. The main protagonists were very well developed, especially Star Lord, I like his character a lot. I didn't like Drax very much, as I thought that most aspects of his personality were too over the top. The special effects were amazing, as expected from a Marvel movie. Overall, I just think that it is an average attempt at combining Star Wars and the Suicide Squad (I'm not saying that Suicide Squad was good though)."
" 'Guardians' go big, not home
",0.0,0.9925,2017-07-04 00:00:00,7,"2014 was a crowded year for superhero films, and James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' emerged as the highest-grossing of them all. The unconventional film follows a bunch of intergalactic misfits who are forced to band together in order to survive a villainous pursuit of a weapon of mass destruction in the form of an orb.While 'Guardians' is a member of the Marvel family, it definitely is not your uncle's superhero movie. It might just be your grandfather's, though, based on the soundtrack of psychedelic 60's and 70's tunes that permeate the scenes of spacecraft, aliens and lasers - which makes for a creative juxtaposition. But perhaps the best part of the film is the camaraderie that develops between everyone - from Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) to Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and the rag- tag bunch of Drax, Rocket and Groot (Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, respectively). It's great to see everyone's relationships change over the course of the film, as circumstances more or less bring them together.'Guardians' is not a groundbreaking film, per se, but it is different enough from our standard fare that it has a sense of originality, which works to its advantage. The dialogue is smart, funny and not totally idiotic, as it easily could have been. Even the special effects are what you would expect from a big budget blockbuster, so there are no real weak spots in what is an otherwise run-of-the- mill action-packed extravaganza.True - there are plenty of seemingly similar films out there to watch, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is an example of how to offer up something that can satisfy a diverse audience and appeal to all age groups while still being pretty entertaining."
" Fast n' funny
",0.4404,0.9945,2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"I am watching guardians for the 2nd time and I am still amazed with this movie. I have forgot how funny it actually is.What I really liked about it is such a relaxed attitude about, pretty much everything through out the entire movie. The story, cast, acting, everything is so relaxed. So much that you lose feeling of action. And maybe I would sound weird but at the same time I didn't like it. Maybe it is because I watched it before but I haven't felt that thrill and action not once. It seems like they are not even trying and still they menage to win at everything. Also, at some point I felt like I am watching a cartoon.I sound so cranky but it isn't that bad. It isn't at all. I am amazed with the environment, CGI work, next level acting and an interesting story but I cant get over with that ease of their success and the fact they won everything without losing anything. I think Guardians lack a bit of sorrow that would make the whole picture much more realistic.The movie is fast, energetic, funny as hell and so easy to watch. Linear story without many twists and retrospection, lovely story about love an friendship, cartoonish characters and much more awaits after you press the play button on Guardians of the Galaxy."

" Guardians 2 Is As Good As Guardians 1
",0.4404,0.99,2017-06-05 00:00:00,10,"""Super"" writer & director James Gunn took moviegoers for an irreverent, interplanetary joyride, peppered with pop culture references, in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" back in 2014. Happily, Gunn's sequel ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2"" qualifies as just as impressive with several surprises. If you haven't seen ""GoTG, Vol. 1,"" then you may have problems putting both the swashbuckling characters and their outlandish backstory into context in this imaginative, science-fiction, follow-up saga. Good sequels always dig deeper into the original characters and conjure up newcomers. ""GoTG, Vol. 2"" reassembles the same quintet and scrutinizes them in greater detail. Peter Quill, ostensibly the Guardians' leader, catches up with his enigmatic sire, Ego, and father and son surprise each other with their goals during the second act. We learn that Ego has been searching the universe for his long, lost son. Later, Yondu observes astutely about the grandiose Ego: ""He may have been your father, Quill, but he wasn't your daddy."" This father and son connection yields the ultimate surprise, too, but discretion prevents me from divulging specifics. The peculiar relationship that Quill has forged with Yondu Udonta, the extraterrestrial space pirate who abducted Quill from Earth after the lad fled from the hospital where his cancer-stricken mom died takes on an added dimension. No character changes as much in ""GoTG 2"" as Yondu. He evolves from a villain to an honorable individual. Meanwhile, sibling rivalry keeps Quill's quasi-girlfriend Gamora locked into a feud with her jealous sister Nebula. Nebula hates Gamora with a passion because their evil stepfather Thanos preferred Gamora over her. Smutty-mouthed Rocket Raccoon remains as obnoxious as ever, but his bad-tempered attitude thaws during the third act. Good sequels send off the characters onto exciting new adventures against different villains. The Guardians are summoned to a remote corner of the cosmos again. The new aliens—the Sovereigns—constitute a petulant people with little sense of humor. When Rocket infuriates them, the latter pursue the Guardians with a vengeance until greater powers interfere.The last time we saw the Guardians, the Nova Corps had cleared them of all crimes and provided them with a refurnished version of his spaceship ""The Milano."" The arboreal, sentient-like, extraterrestrial Groot (Vin Diesel's voice) had sacrificed himself to save his companions, but Rocket Raccoon scourged up a surviving twig and has planted it. As ""GoTG, Vol. 2,"" unfolds, an arrogant race of gilded humanoids known as the Sovereigns have employed our motley crew to protect their priceless batteries from an enormous but absurd-looking trout with thrashing tentacles and thousands of thorny teeth. During the hilarious opening credits gambit, the roguish Star-Lord (Chris Pratt of ""The Magnificent Seven""), green-skinned Amazon Gamora (Zoe Saldana of ""Colombiana""), blue-skinned hulk Drax (Dave Bautista of ""Spectre""), and pugnacious Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper's voice) tangle with this cartoonish thing atop a platform where the batteries are housed that resembles an electric razor. During this far-fetched fracas, Baby Groot dances to Star-Lord's mix tape oblivious to any peril the fire-breathing trout-squid poses while the Guardians struggle to slay their nemesis. The scene is clever because Gunn choreographs this blockbuster action with Baby Groot in the foreground rather than the contentious Guardians! Afterward, the grateful Sovereigns reward our heroes with nothing less than Gamora's deceitful sister Nebula! No sooner have our heroes proved their nerve to the Sovereigns than they find themselves in trouble with them. The contemptuous Rocket has taken it upon himself to steal some of those valuable batteries. The incensed Sovereigns deployed a drone fleet to annihilate the Guardians. Conveniently, Peter Quill's biological father Ego (Kurt Russell of ""The Hateful 8"") intervenes and saves them from the Sovereigns. Ego invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to accompany him to his planet, while Rocket, Baby Groot, and Nebula stay behind to repair their crashed spacecraft.Meantime, the haughty Sovereign High Priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki of ""The Great Gatsby"") hires arrow-whistling Ravager chieftain Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker of ""The Belk Experiment"") to track down the Guardians. What Yondu doesn't know is a perfidious faction within his gang of smugglers has been plotting mutiny. Yondu's grotesque lieutenant, Taserface (Chris Sullivan of ""Imperium""), sparks this uprising. After they catch up with Rocket, Baby Groot, and Nebula, the mutinous Ravagers turn on Yondu and lock him up with Rocket. Nevertheless, Yondu and Rocket aren't idle behind bars for long because Baby Groot helps them to escape. Mind you, Yondu was already up to his ears in trouble with the rest of the Ravagers and their commander, Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone of ""Rocky""), who turned against him for kidnapping Peter Quill in the first place. If you saw the original ""G0TG,"" you know Star-Lord tricked Yondu when he relinquished the Orb. The wily Star-Lord replaced the Infinity Stone that had been in the Orb with a grinning troll doll. Yondu had payback in mind when he sold his services to the Sovereigns, but then everything went sideways for him. Nevertheless, once Rocket, Baby Groot, and he escape, Yondu eliminates their adversaries with his whistling arrow.The major revelation of the ""Guardians"" sequel concerns the character of Ego. Kurt Russel looks like he had a blast playing this murderous Celestial being who is essentially a manifestation of a psychedelic planet that Ego created for himself. Basically, he is a selfish amoral deity who behaves like the Greek god Zeus. During their brief stint on the planet, Peter and Ego begin on friendly terms until Ego slips up and reveals something appalling that alienates Peter. With its sumptuous CGI of alien galaxies and landscapes, ""GoTG, Vol. 2"" looks a hundred times better visually than its predecessor. If you enjoyed the greatest hits music in the original film, the sequel serves up even more memorable pop tunes and incorporates them into the psychology of the plot, too! As the fifteenth entry in the Marvel Comics Cinematic Universe, the tongue-in-cheek ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 2"" ranks as one of the best."

",0.3612,0.8987,2017-06-01 00:00:00,5,"Guardians of the Galaxy feels like a Roger Corman space opera on steroids.Fortunately the movie acknowledges its absurdity, so the makers flavour this adrenaline shake with plenty of humour. The laughs are the best part of this Marvel circus. Otherwise, the experience is surprisingly numbing. It is over saturated in noise, colourful effects and action, and underwhelming in character, and intimate scenes.Michael Rooker's face is a major distraction. He looks like an understudy for the Blue Man Group show. Unfortunaelty he chooses not to play for laughs, so his dead pan presence is curiously awkward.The climax involves major aerial fire fights which demonstrate the problems that I have with 21st century CGI; There is too much to see and nothing to focus on.Ignoring the humour that make certain scenes worthwhile, Guardians of the Galaxy is unremarkable; another superhero spectacle that thinks we all have ADD."

Also, I wasn't fully caught up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe either so any references would've gone over my head.So it was an incredible feeling watching this film, having every character introduced to you efficiently and effectively, and relating to them fairly well. The story is fairly standard. Gang of misfits join together to take on a space terrorist. All the story beats are there. But while the story seems kinda basic, the soundtrack is incredible, the characters are likable as hell and the CGI is phenomenal. This film will literally bring you to tears over a raccoon and a tree.The makeup is impressive as well. The amount of man hours it must have taken to paint several main and supporting actors different colours to make them aliens is incredible and the effort really shines through here.This is up on my top 5 list of the Marvel films."
" Almost got me

What didn't get to me, however, was the character of the villain - nothing particular about him that made me excited. Definitely not the best sci-fi movie I've seen in a while, but it should be given the chance, especially if you're seeking amusement."
" Good music and good laugh ;)
",0.8834,0.9874,2017-05-24 00:00:00,10,"The movie directed by James Gunn, a part of Marvel Cinematic Universe. A group of dysfunctional criminals is forced to work together to save the universe. As main characters, we can see Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper). It's a great movie. In my opinion the best from Marvel Cinematic Universe so far. A lot of humor and action. Also the great music and jokes, that make you laugh at loud. All that sum up and makes this movie so special and so good. Really good job, Mr. James Gunn! ;) I can without any doubt recommend this movie ;)"
" A light and breezy outer space romp
",0.0,0.9939,2017-05-18 00:00:00,7,"GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a fun and light-hearted superhero romp from Marvel. The setting is outer space and the film is a sensory overload at first, featuring an unknown cast of colourful alien beings interacting in a standard storyline involving the possession of a magical, world-destroying device. The first thing you notice is the quality of the CGI effects, which as in the recent DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, are quite remarkable and photo-realistic for the main part.The hero of the piece is Chris Pratt, nowadays hot property but an actor I can take or leave. He does his usual cocky routine, but the supporting cast are much more interesting: Zoe Saldana takes a similar role to her one in AVATAR but has a lot more fun, while Dave Bautista is hilarious and even Bradley Cooper's raccoon character is lovable. Groot isn't quite on the same level as Treebeard but is still amusing, and you have to love others like Michael Rooker's larger-than-life space pirate. The plot is derivative and predictable, and the spaceship action scenes are still copying STAR WARS some thirty-plus years later, but the camaraderie is good-natured and, more importantly, funny. The result is a light and breezy movie that never loses momentum, and leaves you happily looking forward to the sequel."
" Marvel's Star Wars!
",-0.5983,0.9831,2017-05-16 00:00:00,10,"Guardians of the Galaxy launched in 2014 to surprisingly good box office numbers and amazing reviews from critics. And then came one of Marvel's most unlikely franchises-to-be; and what a franchise Guardians has become! I remember watching this film for the first time when it came out. A raccoon, a tree, that guy from Parks-and-Rec as 'Not-Han-or-Luke' StarLord, Uhura as a green alien, and... Dave Bautista's in this!? I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and the thrill it gave the audience. It's a space opera in the superhero world of Marvel, and it's an intergalactic love-letter to George Lucas' films of the 70s and 80s. You can see Indiana Jones at parts, you can sense Star Wars when there's moments similar to The Original Trilogy in terms of character chemistry and scale, yet this has the heart of a superhero movie. It's got the fun of Sam Raimi's first two SpiderMan movies, it succeeds where green LAntern failed and it doesn't need to be somber like Batman movies. Guardians of the Galaxy is its own thing.Needless to say: I love this film! When I was missing Star Wars until The Force Awakens came along, I had Guardians and Interstellar to occupy myself with in the meantime. I'm glad that this film was successful; it's cinema-escapism that's pretty irresistible."
" One of the most entertaining Marvel movies
",0.7408,0.9905,2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's full of great characters, humor, special effects and fun action scenes. Oh!, and of course the fantastic soundtrack! I would definitely rank this as one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first time I watched it the villain, Ronan, kind of annoyed me, but on the second viewing I didn't get the same feeling about that character. His kind of over the top menacing bad guy routine sort of works with the overall goofy tone of the film. I love how this movie takes these virtually unknown characters and really makes you want to see more of them in the future. I also admire how this film doesn't take itself seriously without crossing the line of becoming a full on parody of the superhero genre. This comes from the skillful execution and placement of the humor throughout the movie.8/10************SPOILERS************ Recommended for those that enjoy K-Billy's super sounds of the 70's, orphan abduction, hot shot renegade smart alecks with big hearts, disgruntled ex-blue man group members, green is the new black, daddy issues, literal interpretations of the spoken word, talking space rodents, talking space plants, I am Groot!, I! am Groot, I am!

" What a great sci-fi movie
",0.6249,0.9956,2017-05-15 00:00:00,10,"Just watch it on DVD and has been left with a feeling ""I need to see next part"". I know this film was out for 3 years now but I need to say that I waited far to long. From the beginning to the end I could laugh and enjoy special effect together with superb acting. Especially Chris Pratt who fit into his role perfect. I can't imagine anyone else who could act better. He is young version of captain Solo from Star Wars (Harrison Ford). All characters well contribute to the sense of humor in this movie. I liked the idea of that film and speed of action. Like I said I can't wait to go to cinema and watch vol.2. Soundtrack was well chosen. For me this movie is for 10. Enjoy watching it!! Love Marvel Studios"
" It's basically a dumbed down fast and furious
",-0.7269,-0.9317,2017-05-14 00:00:00,1,"I held on on watching this for a long time, as I hate one liner jokes, 0 plot and awful character development, which is basically 99% of what Marvel movies are about.I expected the fighting scenes to be confusing and flat.I expected the movie to tell me how I should feel instead of giving me a reason to feel that way.I expected a villain with 0 credibility and awful CGI.That's all par for the course, what I did not expect though, is to fall asleep after 10 minutes after I just had a big coffee. Seriously, this movie is so incredibly boring that I fail to understand why people like it so much.This movie was so painful to sit through, and not just because of the dumbness of everything that was going on, that much was already a given, I mean it's a superhero movie with a full CGI raccoon among the top stars..Special note to the awful soundtrack that went against the flow of the movie.All in all, this one is not as dumb as Doctor Strange, but it's close to be and it is just as unfunny. Legitimately after the movie, I had no idea in which place and time the movie was happening. Give it a go if you have insomnia."

",0.8779,-0.9712,2017-05-06 00:00:00,10,"One of the best Marvel films, Guardians of the Galaxy is a hilarious space opera with a heart and great soundtrack. After being updated over two decades ago, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is a Ravager searching for an orb proclaimed to have great power. He escapes from Korath (Djimon Hounsou) and his minions but is unable to sell it when it is revealed that Ronan (Lee Pace) also wants it. The bounty hunter raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his partner Groot (Vin Diesel) try to capture Quill but Gamora (Zoe Saldana) sent by Ronan fights them to also capture Quill. All of them are captured by the Nova Corps and imprisoned. Tying to the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thanos (Josh Brolin) allows Ronan to use his daughters, Gamora and Nebula (Karen Gillan), to hunt for the orb. Yondu (Michael Rooker) the alien that first abducted Peter Quill is also after the orb. The group encounters Drax (Dave Bautista) a muscle bound criminal who wants to murder Ronan for killing his family. The group escapes the prison, and Gamora takes them to the Collector (Benicio Del Toro) to sell the orb. It is revealed that inside the orb is an Infinity Stone, likely the Power Stone, capable of destroying the galaxy.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" It's Okay, But It Is A Very Familiar Marvel Story Could Have Been Better.
",0.8562,0.9978,2017-05-06 00:00:00,7,"Another Marvel picture to expand their universe a little more. However, this didn't live up to the hype or the fanboy hysteria, well, not for me.I have to say though the special effects crew were running on all cylinders as the visuals are truly spectacular and as close to flawless as you could get. It was pretty difficult to see where the CGI kissed the reality. Much respect for the crew.Respect too to the Director James Gunn who did a splendid job keeping the action flying and the drama, what little there was, at a steady pace and flow.However, I would have liked the formula to be a little different as it ran straight in line with all the other Marvel films. As soon as they knew they had a winning formula with Avengers Assemble their team movies have kept to that style, which unfortunately is running thin.As for the characters, they could be interchangeable with others from the movie universe. Personally, I would have loved to see the original version of Star-Lord who was a much stronger character than the one here, who is a cross between Steve Rodgers and Tony Stark... He even had the ego and nerve to call himself ""Star-Lord"" - what an arsehole. This should have been the title handed down to him from his father, who was a Universe Policeman. It also would've been nice to have had his original ship as it was a living entity and a character in its own right - but no, we stick to the formula.Gamora was just a green skinned Black Widow... with some of the same moves.Drax was a less powerful Hulk. Though he had the inevitable ""The bad guy killed my family"" scenario, where the Hulk's incentive is to SMASH... Drax has the same compulsion but to KILL.The best thing, by far, were the two CGI characters of Rocket Raccoon and Groot who were brilliantly voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Cooper's vocal portrayal was so perfect for the character; and even though Groot only said ""Groot"" Diesel added depth and character to every ""Groot"" spoken.These two also seemed to get the better scene's like the one where they're planning to escape but are wondering how they can get one of the escape plans components. While they are talking about this Groot just goes and gets it. Then when the action starts it's always Rocket you look to because this Racoon loves his weapons with a passion verging on obsession.Respect to the actors who portrayed the hero's as they all did a great job it's not their fault there wasn't much scope for character growth. I just think that Marvel is coming close to stereotyping themselves. They could do with spreading their wings a little wider.With that in mind, it would be nice to have a villain who isn't trying to conquer or destroy worlds, we've seen it before. when we finally get to the much hinted at and waited for Thanos what will he be doing? Oh yes, probably looking to destroy or conquer the world.Then there's the awesome 80's soundtrack courtesy of Peter Quill's walkman... where does' he get the batteries from? Probably that's what the Ravagers were stealing on Earth when they picked him up. The director uses the soundtrack to it's greatest potential. Well done.All in all, it's a well told and fantastically rendered story, though all too familiar, with great action sequences, so leave your brain at the door and enjoy."

",0.1027,0.9957,2017-05-06 00:00:00,8,"This movie is amazing on so many levels.Fun. Just an entertaining film. Great music, story telling and dialogue. The humor will not be for everyone. You have to give yourself over to the absurdity of a walking, semi-talking tree or a small mammal that love guns. But once you do, you're in for a good time.Characters. They grow and develop which is the mark of any great film. Everyone has flaws. All of them, and especially the leader, Star Lord, are so ""awkward"" and so ""human."" They experience defeat. But in the end (spoiler alert), they come together, believe in each other and win.Favorite scene: Star Lord's big inspirational speech to the team which starts out, ""I see a bunch of losers."" Sacrifice. It's not all fun and games. (Another spoiler alert!) In a powerful scene of sacrificial love, Groot gives himself up at the end, wrapping the team in a protective ball made out of himself. (Groot, a tree-like character, interweaves branches of himself to shield everyone from a deadly crash).Is there any better expression of love? (If you know the scene, you know how amazing Groot's final words are!) For anyone who knows what it is to feel like you don't belong or feel awkward, but who also longs for true friendship, this is a good story to go see.Looking forward to Vol. 2. Go Guardians!Overall Score: 8 out of 10."

" Hooked on a feeling
",0.128,0.9981,2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"From the studio that brought you Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Thor & The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy arrives as Marvel Studios' biggest gamble to date and yet, the risk pays off tremendously well as this crazy mixture of an oddball cast & an eccentric crew strikes gold for the studio in both critical & commercial departments and succeeds as an immensely enjoyable, extremely entertaining & most satisfying Marvel piece since The Avengers.Set in a galaxy far far away, Guardian of the Galaxy concerns a notorious scavenger who finds himself as the main target of a manhunt after stealing a mysterious orb and is put in prison along with a deadly assassin, a genetically-engineered raccoon & a tree- like humanoid where they encounter a brute looking for vengeance. As an uneasy alliance form between these extra-terrestrial misfits, they learn to work together as a team & try to save the world when a greater threat arises.There is so much in here that could've so easily gone wrong and there's no denying that many eyebrows were raised when James Gunn was brought in to direct this high-budget space epic. But he has done his job with such precision craftsmanship that it feels like a work of an auteur & the remarkable use of humour infused into its blockbuster elements only makes the experience all the more amusing, enriching & delightfully engaging.Coming to its technical aspects, every single filmmaking department works in near-perfect harmony with the other in a manner that only elevates its overall story & characters to new heights. Set pieces are impressive to look at, make-up adds a dimension of its own to its characters, its homage to many space classics is tastefully carried out, cinematography makes dynamic use of camera without ever getting carried away, editing is tight, VFX is seamless & the selection of songs is near-perfect.The cast is as eccentric & diverse as the characters present in the film with Chris Pratt (Peter Quill), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Dave Bautista (Drax), Vin Diesel (Groot) & Bradley Cooper (Rocket) playing the role of Guardians and each of them deliver excellent performances with Groot & Rocket leaving the most lasting impression. Also chipping in with fair doses are Lee Pace (Ronan), Michael Rooker (Yondu) & Karen Gillian (Nebula), with brief appearance from Benicio del Toro & John C. Reilly also adding more flavours to the film.On an overall scale, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most exquisitely balanced cinematic offerings of 2014 that promises a lot of fun from start to finish and seamlessly delivers it in an endlessly entertaining & immensely rewarding manner. Ingeniously directed, wonderfully light-hearted, fluidly photographed, skilfully edited, splendidly performed & featuring dazzling visuals, Guardians of the Galaxy is arguably the ballsiest big-budget production to surface on the silver screen since James Cameron's Avatar. Delightfully recommended."
" Good fun, and love the soundtrack.
",0.886,0.9478,2017-04-25 00:00:00,7,"Guardians of the Galaxy was a bit of a surprise package for me. The movie is good fun and a decent time filler thanks to the charismatic Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star Lord, and the revival of many old songs featured heavily in the soundtrack. It could have been dismissed as loud mindless nonsense, but Guardians of the Galaxy proved to be a big hit.After being abducted by space pirated following his mother's death, Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) finds himself making a living on Planet Morag as a space adventurer. Peter finds himself being hunted by bounty hunters sent by Ronan (Lee Pace) after he steals an orb. After being captured by Nova Corps officers and imprisoned, Quill manages to break out after forming an uneasy alliance with fellow ragtag misfits Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), Gamora (Zoe Saldanda), and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Battista). When the orb's true power and the cosmic threat it poses is revealed, the group of misfit heroes must band together to save all of mankind.Chris Pratt's Peter Quill/Star Lord is a mixture of Han Solo, Indiana Jones, and Marty McFly. Chris Pratt was well known as an overweight comedic actor who drastically reinvented himself and his career by embarking on a very strict fitness regime and turned himself into a heroic leading man with a new found appeal amongst many fans.Zoe Saldanda, Dave Battista, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper round out the supporting cast, but there is a further star studded cast with Michael Rooker, Glenn Close, John C Reilly, Djimon Hounsou, Karen Gillan, Lee Pace and Benicio del Toro also feature in the movie.Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun ride and is something you just can sit back and enjoy. Chris Pratt's charisma and the brilliant soundtrack also add to the appeal.Enjoy yourself.7/10."

The acting is good and the action is reasonable but I think the praise this movie receives for its 'amazing humour' or 'new fresh format in the MCU' is complete rubbish and, while I can watch it every once and a while, it isn't as amazing or groundbreaking as people say it is.The types of people who will like this people will be fans of the MCU, fans of Marvel Comics and fans of Sci-fi action movies with aliens and other planets.Would Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Chris Pratt was excellent as Star Lord as was Zoe Saldana as Gamora. Bradley Cooper was amazing as Rocket and made him my favourite character. His partner, Groot, was also amazing and delivered so much character and emotion in THREE words. As much as I'm in the minority of this movie, that is very impressive. Dave Boutista was good as Drax the Destroyer. All the guardians were pretty interesting and had defining moments to express themselves. Lee Pace was pretty weak as Ronan the Acuser and the actual villain itself was very weak. I also didn't feel invested with any of the guardians and didn't care if any of them lived or died.The doomsday weapon was kinda cool and the ending was pretty nice. The actual story was very weak and the motivations were very poor and felt forced.I had neither flaws nor strengths to comment on the cinematography.The effects were pretty good and the costume/set design was good.A select few jokes made me chuckle but it's not as hilarious as many people say. It made a very obscure team of characters a success and introduces them all well so I will give it props for that. There was some decent action and some bad action; it was about a 50/50 split.The music was flawless and Groot is well Groot. Groot is good. Groot is Groot.Personally, I enjoy this movie but it's in the lower half of the MCU movies for me.7/10"
" Most entertaining movie in years
",0.4927,0.9987,2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"The Guardians of the Galaxy is just pure entertainment. The film mixes science-fiction, adventure and comedy in the right dose and concentration. It has great tempo, unforgettable well-developed characters you like or hate immediately and great music. The production is amazing: the special effects, architectural designs, ambiance, dresses, makeup, sound, and overall design are fantastic. However, that would be irrelevant if the script, the dialogues and the acting weren't good, but they are excellent.One of the things that contributes to the success of the film is how well the actors are cast for their respective characters, and how good he actors are in their roles. I loved Pratt as Peter Quill (a witty mix of Indiana Jones and Han Solo with whom I fell in love immediately) Diesel as the magical Groot (I would have never thought that I would like Diesel on anything), and Lee Pace as the super-villain Ronan (truly the best acting in the film). However, Cooper does one of his best jobs as an actor dubbing the very funny sarcastic grumpy but loyal Rocket, Saldana shines as the kick-ass sexy fighter Gamora, and Bautista is really charming as the word-literal sensitive brute Drax. To be fair, all actors, even the supporting ones, do a great job. This is a chorus movie in which everyone sings well and does what is supposed to do at the right time the right way.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most entertaining amusing unpretentious enjoyable films I've seen in the last years. Of course the movie is light, there is not philosophical approach to anything, there is not subtext, but the movie does to perfection what intends to do -- it does entertain you for over two hours and makes you forget that you are human and live in the real world. We are all the Guardians of the Galaxy. That is priceless.I had a ball watching this film. I hope you too."
" The best Marvel Movie
",0.7906,0.9891,2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"After i saw the first trailer for the Guardians of the Galaxy, i couldn't help but think that it was just a rip off of the avengers. But i was very, very wrong. It focuses on a group of galactic criminals that accidentally join forces to stop a mad man and his goons destroying the galaxy. The characters were amazing. They all play their role excellently and deliver a handful of laughs. The action and set pieces are great to. The thing that kinda bothered me in avengers was that they saved all the action til the very end, but its all over the place in this movie. I thought that this movie was better than the Avengers. It just has better action, better character development, and better set pieces (not a better villain though). So overall, Guardians Of The Galaxy is an action packed ride which has great characters and earns the spot on my favorite Marvel movie of all time. A+ or 10/10. I am so excited for The Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2"
" We Are Groot
",0.0,0.917,2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"An alliance uneasily develops between five diverse individuals, each after the same valuable orb, in this action-packed science fiction film. It turns out that the orb in question has the power to destroy entire universes, and while the protagonists are initially motivated by greed, willing to sell to the highest bidder, they gradually become the responsible heroes of the title as they instead try to keep the orb out of evil hands. With little explanation of how the orb works, it becomes little more than a Hitchcockian McGuffin, and with a truckload of explosive action sequences towards the end, the film often seems more interested in being a spectacle to look at than spinning a decent yarn. That said, the characters here are surprisingly three dimensional with the film getting most of its zest from how well they interact with each other. Chris Pratt is especially good as the wisecracking Earthling among them with a fondness for 1970s and 80s music, though the best moments are had by a talking raccoon and tree, both genetically modified to the point of being sentient. The film is a little dry in the moments when neither Pratt nor the raccoon nor the tree are on screen, but as they are present in over 90% of the movie, it is an enthralling ride overall even when the action becomes a tad mindless towards the end. The sci-fi content may not be great here, but the humour frequently works, and with such delightfully offbeat characters, it is easy to see why this hit the right note with many filmgoers when it was first released."

Looking round on Netflix UK,I stumbled on a Marvel title that was about to leave the site,which led to me going on a galaxy quest.The plot:Since being kidnapped by the outlaw gang the Ravagers 20 years ago, Peter Quill has joined them on their pirate missions. On a planet Quill gets hold of an orb which can destroy the world. Learning of the orb,a fellow outlaw puts a bounty on Quill,whilst the mysterious Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after Quill. About to sell the orb,Quill gets caught in a cross-fire between assassin Gamora and bounty hunters Groot and Rocket,whose interest in the Orb and money soon leads to them all guarding the galaxy. View on the film:Exploring a Comic-Book galaxy separate from the overall Marvel Universe,co-writer/(along with Nicole Perlman) director James Gunn & cinematographer Ben Davis take the opportunity to kick the genre with new funky colours,from the bright green of Gamora and the adorable Groot,to the space Steam Punk Western guns of Peter Quill and Yondu Udonta's outlaw Ravagers. Standing out by mixing Tyler Bates's swift score with rocking 60's/70's songs,Gunn sets the space adventure on a rich retro atmosphere,as the outer space talking raccoon and thrilling space battles are neatly balanced by vintage cassettes and rusting rockets.Sending the gang across space to protect the orb,the screenplay by Gunn and Nicole Perlman smartly go for a ""men on a mission"" outline,that keeps the group united with a common goal building towards an explosive final showdown. Being one of the few Comic- Book flicks that's able to skip the ""origin arc"", the writers use the more relaxed atmosphere to fire up refreshing character moments,that shines in the growing,comedic relationship between Rocket and Groot,and the high-kicking underlying romance between tough outlaws Quill and Gamora, (played by the fantastic, lively improvising Chris Pratt and the rough & tumble Zoe Saldana )as the Guardians of the Galaxy go halfway across the galaxy,and turn left."
" This pop culture smörgåsbord is a crowd pleaser
",0.4019,0.8381,2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"After 20 minutes on first view on DVD, I bolted. Too much to accept on face value and too much too follow while doing so..... Then I received numerous suggestions for a second take. I heard things like, ""Dude, the soundtrack is from the '70's which you love"". I also heard the Star Wars similarities, a little bit of The Wizard of Oz, and (you got it) the plot is actually a no brainer once you get past a talking raccoon (with a wise cracking New York City attitude) and all of the characters you are meeting shooting at each other. Who are we rooting for? Oh, all of them. I get it... let the sci-fi predictable adventure begin. Now you must get past that downer, but with our hero, his babe, a talking wood stick, aforementioned raccoon with the tide and a WWE wrestler, there's plenty to keep you watching."
" I don't think this movie can be spoiled(Minor Spoilers)
",0.0,-0.9973,2017-03-10 00:00:00,1,"Where do I even begin with this movie? From the fact that the characters don't have 1% background for the motives they have in this film... to the stupid humor that feels so unnecessary in sooo many scenes that ruins the tone of the movie and makes you question yourself was this supposed to be a comedy or a serious movie? OK, let's get on with the review:The Characters: There's literally 1 scene to introduce the character of Star Lord, and it's supposed to make us care for him since some of his close people dies... it doesn't give context to his story as to why we should feel for him. But the movie quickly goes to action, space then more action then humor then even more action then even more humor... and that's basically it! The rest of the characters are literally there to fill the character queue and have ourselves a team in the process. The closest Marvel movie that can relate to this is Fantastic Four(the 2005 one) where the characters shared a connection that made their process of becoming a team so much believable, while here they are introduced to us with no context whatsoever to the actual story or with no hint of connection between them and to put it more simply no context to their story, they just pop out in the beginning as the movie progresses. Their background story is literally a couple of one- liners, that's it! Fantastic Four at least developed as best as it could the characters it had before pitting them in the superhero war... and yes the movie is bad, but is bad due to poor filmmaking but this movie is even worse than that one not due to poor filmmaking but to the poor story and stupid humor which nowadays seems to make up for idiotic story in the eyes of some people. Next, the villain. Where do I pick this guy... he's the most predictable and boring villain ever(ties with the one from Ant-Man and more recently Steppenwolf from JL). There's literally 0 motivation for why he's doing what he's doing. It's like he turns against his master and decides to try and destroy a planet because this movie needs a villain and that's it(sure, some people will say that he was in conflict with the people from that planet, but the movie doesn't show that so I don't believe it), buy that, digest that and be happy with that. In the older Marvel movies like Spider-man trilogy, the bad guy had a motivation for what he was doing being either revenge or to prove himself. Here... 0 motivation.Next the story: So immature from the stupid humor that made characters so unbelievable to the crazy and idiotic situations like dancing in front of the bad guy just to distract him? Come one there are thousand of different ways to distract a person... but the movie just keeps going with the stupidity of exaggerated humor to abominable limits.The action: This probably the only part where the movie succeeded. The CGI was good and the fight scenes well choreographed but they hit something of a block due to the stupid humor that almost ruins every last one of them. Oh, but let's not forget that after you build the impenetrability of Ronan's scepter along the whole movie... in the end a small rocket destroys it and releases the infinity stone which is caught by Star Lord and somehow it doesn't kill him(you can say that the team helped him absorb the energy of the stone but the movie doesn't explain that so I don't buy it) because it's later revealed that his father was some sort of freaking alien that could resist to the power of the infinity stone. How convenient right? The movie only reveals it now without any tease among the whole 2 hours of the film which makes me believe that it was made up on the way type of garbage.I could go on and write tons of other arguments related to the bad acting and stupid scenes that ruin the eventual character development this movie might have - if it had one - but I'll stop here because I said the most important things that bothered me. Old Marvel movies used to spend time with their characters while here is just another set up for MCU future films that in my opinion fails miserably and makes for a joke of a movie. The huge rating of this tr6sh shows how easily people are fooled to digest stupidity and the worst part of it all is that lately this is how Marvel and some other type of movies are made like... So my rating will be 1 for this piece of tr6sh that deserves to be shown on Cartoon Network in order to make kids laugh harder, not in cinema or on another TV non-cartoon network.Oh, there's gonna be a vol. 2 of this cr6p, so for those seeking a mature story driven movie, avoid it at all costs!"
" Oof -- That was bad.
",-0.5423,-0.9547,2017-02-27 00:00:00,1,"LOL! An 8.1 rating at IMDb! It surely seems that the movie studios are automating the stock/robotic positive reviews that overtake this site for each new big budget failure. Come to think of it...I haven't had to fill out a CAPTCHA lately...hmmAnyhow, I made it about 45 minutes in before cutting my losses.Zoe Saldana basically plays the same uninspiring role in every movie she's in...here she's green, there she's blue. Chris Pratt's character seems like it came from the cutting room floor of an American Pie movie admixed with a touch of the Rocketeer. Pratt and Saldana have no chemistry together. The CGI cybernetic, jokester raccoon with the voice of Bradley Cooper is also among the worst characters ever conceived for a movie.The plot was meh at best and the whole production was dragged down by one of the worst screenplays ever put together. I mean it was really awful. Chock full of ""jokes"" and one-liners that just weren't funny. Not even smirk-worthy funny, let alone laughter-inducing. The dialog was artificial and embarrassing for whoever penned it. It was bad and s/he should feel bad for it. This movie tried way too hard to be Star Wars meets the Avengers and it wasn't successful at it.Also featured was too much exposition about what Ronin or Thanos had done or were trying to do; ""you're Draxx the Destroyer!"" type telling rather than showing. None of the characters were introduced in a logical or organic way; they mostly seemed shoehorned in.I think it says a lot about the acting when a CGI tree (hint: wooden) is the best of the bunch.Yes, you are Groot. And I will not be watching anything connected with Guardians of the Galaxy again."
" Great Movie!
",0.6588,0.9583,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"We usually do not watch these types of movies, however, we were pleasantly surprised with Guardians of the Galaxy. Not only were the special effects outstanding, so was the acting, which is becoming a rarity these days. The screenwriters did a great job with this production. Good job Hollywood!"
" Exciting romp through the galaxy.
",0.4939,0.9281,2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"James Gunn co-writes and directs this fantasy piece based on the Marvel comic book. Two hours of extremely exciting action, adventure, drama, comedy, inspiring cinematography and unbelievable CGI. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is an arrogant space pilot that makes a living collecting ""junk"" and most of all wants to be known as the 'Star Lord'. Quill has gotten his hands on a rare space orb coveted by Ronan (Lee Pace), a bitter intergalactic warlord. Peter gathers a ragtag team of oddballs that are destined to be heroes as they stand between Ronan and the destruction of the galaxy.Fast paced and held together with a soundtrack featuring the likes of: Redbone, Runaways, Elvin Bishop, David Bowie and Raspberries.A talented cast that includes: Zoe Saldana, Michael Rooker, Benicio Del Toro, Karen Gillan, Christopher Fairbank, John C. Reilly and Glenn Close. Plus the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel."
" Nothing overtly memorable here with the exception of the 80's soundtrack
",0.0,0.9817,2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Call me old fashioned but I just didn't get the hype surrounding Guardians of the Galaxy. It took me several times to actually get through it and while I appreciate a good space adventure and fantasy movie it just didn't grab me like it grabbed a lot of people. Praise to the artists who brought it to life and judging by the credits there were a lot of them but either it's the wrong time for me or I am just CGI'd out at this point. It took me out of the movie and with all the superhero movies hitting screens, this one just seemed pretty standard to me.Some good action scenes, some funny characters and moments but nothing overtly memorable here with the exception of the 80's soundtrack. It's a popcorn movie - the cast did a good job with everything they had and that's all you can ask for. I just wasn't feeling it through Guardians of the Galaxy."
" Marvel goes goofy and scores
",0.4215,0.9515,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I can't stop this feeling, deep inside of me.. yeah this film is just a fun fest of a good time. Smiles all around and lollipops. Marvel has some of the biggest balls in the industry. I couldn't believe they made Thor work and now this? Freaking DC can't even get Superman off the ground and this is coming from a huge DC fan! Anyway, this film is about a group of misfits finding each other and becoming a team. Kicking booty and having fun. Need I say more? What really works well is the color in this film. The alien planets each have their own jam and some off them spray groovy color at you with not coming off as lame. This film was supposed to be a one shot deal but because of the massive amount of love given by fans to the film, we are getting a sequel this year. I can't wait."
" Even better than the Avengers!
",0.4926,0.9874,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Just like the new Marvel film Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy takes a step into the mystical magic world of Marvel. If I say so myself, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the top superhero films in the world. It is nothing less of a magnificent movie. it does not only have a great story line, but it also has a great amount of action, comedy and seriousness throughout it.The films hero is Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a hilarious gun man with top notch technology, who we first see stealing a metal orb. Then, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) tries to get the orb for herself. But, the police catch them and they eventually get locked up together with two others. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel). They meet Drax the Destroyer(Dave Bautista) who helps them escape the prison and they set off to find Ronan the Destroyer.For those people who are like film critics or want a movie to be perfect, you will enjoy this. The film has 100% amazing acting, great props, a good and stable story line and the comedy was just right. To conclude, this film is very good. I was thrilled when I left the cinema after watching this film. It may partially scare kids under the age of 10 but it is a very good film. I don't know who my favorite character was because they were all great! Watch this film and you will not be disappointed."
" A romp across the Galaxy to the sounds of the eighties
",0.0,0.9902,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Great fun, a romp across the Galaxy to the sounds of the eighties. A space opera in the vein of Star Wars, but with more humour, rather than a superhero movie - to my mind at least.Very imaginative, with a lot of quotable lines that really make the movie. The script is excellent and the acting better than one would expect. Assembled is a group of fun, interesting and diverse characters, who (like the film) don't take themselves seriously. The movie plays out in variety of exotic CGI locations, which along with the special effects would account for the high budget.Fun for all the family, easy to watch with something for everyone; there shouldn't be many complaints."
