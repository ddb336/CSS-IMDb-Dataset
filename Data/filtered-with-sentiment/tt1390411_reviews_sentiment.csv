" spoiled by 2 choices of director
",0.0,0.9425,2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,"I was very interested in this film and had high expectations. At first I was pleased. The scenes of the busy docks and on the decks of the ship looked authentic. It might have been enough to carry the movie despite its main character looking like a male model rather than an old whaling hand.But it was pretty much all spoiled by two bad choices.
1.- Most scenes were shot with the camera about 18 inches away from the subject. We lost all perspective of what it was like to be on the ship, of what things would have looked like to the characters. It left me longing for the great views of sailing in Mutiny on the Bounty, both versions of which gave time to magnificent scenes of just the ship.
2. - Most of the film was edited like a TV commercial or some action movie aimed at 13-year-olds, that is, with quick cuts throughout. A single shot seldom held for more than 5 seconds.What a shame!"
" Killing whales is not what a 21st century audience is going like.
",-0.4404,-0.9294,2021-03-15 00:00:00,4,"This movie failed . Reasons are given as to why, such as too many goofs, historical or otherwise, CGI flaws, excessive melodrama, even too much meandering. All true but the real reason people didn't like this is because our so called heroes kill whales. Never mind it was a different era with a completely different morality mindset , killing whales is not going to endear you to anybody and the more misfortune that befalls you the better as far as the audience are concerned. Zero chance of sympathy. What's next? Baby seal killers get lost in the Arctic ?"
" Not a great film, but still watchable
",-0.284,-0.4847,2021-03-06 00:00:00,6,"Every actors did a good performance playing their characters. The 1st half in this film was pretty decent, but in the 2nd half everything going wrong, lack of story, lack of intensity & suspenseful, lack of everything and seems illogical.This film still can be enjoyable to watch, if u dont bother the story at the 2nd half."
" Too tame and too fake looking
",-0.4767,0.9096,2021-02-14 00:00:00,6,"This movie overlies on CGI. Yes, I get that there is a lot of CGI needed to showcase the whale but some elements could be done practically. This is a trend that I noticed with old school directors like Howard, Zemeckis, Spielberg and Peter Jackson. They get lazy and just want everything done with special effects. I am a person that is afraid of the ocean and even some cheap shark movies like The Reef can make me feel tense. I was watching Cast Away the other day and that movie made me feel a lot of tension during its ocean scenes. In The Heart of the Sea however doesn't do that at any point. I never felt the tension that I normally get with movies that take place in the ocean as for the most part the ocean didn't look real enough to invoke those feelings in me.As for the plot it's decent although I think the conversation between Melville and Nickerson was totally unnecessary. The plot could've just straight up told the story of the whale destroying the ship without it being a sort of a flashback/story within a story. Moreover, what the film lacks was grit. The story is very harrowing and making the movie PG-13 took away from it's impact. If this movie was rated R it would've been incredibly brutal and would've really made the viewers consider the horrors that these sailors had to endure. I can't see the mass appeal of this movie and as such don't understand why it wasn't made strictly for adults. On the other hand, I have to applaud Howard for working within the confines of a PG-13 rating and including some very agonizing scenes with cuts just at the right time but those moments could've hit home ever harder in an R rated film.It may seem like I didn't enjoy the movie but I did. Chris Hemsworth always makes a movie better through his charisma. The rest of the cast was also good. As fake as some aspects of the movie looked, the whale looked great and I assume most of the CGI work went into making sure that it does. The story is simple but effective and despite its tameness it still made me feel the struggle that the characters faced. There are some really great moments in the film and some rather dull/bad ones but overall it comes together into a coherent whole. I still found plenty of entertainment within this flawed movie but I just wish its full potential was realised which would've happened if it were made for adults and with more emphasis on making the environments feel real through the use of practical effects."

",0.5719,0.9407,2020-11-23 00:00:00,10,"You could really feel like you went on a journey to go whaling when things went wrong, twilight zone like. The actors weren't acting, they were living the roles, wonderful cgi of nature mixed into the practical real world sets made this amazing. Every actor in this made it feel like an adventure I really needed at 4am during covid 19. Go in, turn up the volume, get a glass of water, you'll need it for the long moments when you don't know where you'll end up."
" The Revenant at sea
",0.0,0.9397,2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,"This is not a monster film, its mainly about the hardships and survival of the whaling crew.
There's an all-star cast - I was constantly shouting at the screen as I recognised side-characters like Kat Stark from Got, Nick from Fear the walking dead. The acting, cinematography and music are excellent, so I'm surprised this doesn't have a higher rating.
As another reviewer said, the visuals are like an oil painting: The clouds, water lighting are all beautifully shot, and the CGI is excellent.
There's a fair amount of action with the whaling, but most of the film is focused on the characters, which are all brilliantly portrayed by the lead actors. The depictions of nature, isolation and survival really reminded me of The Revenant.
Watch this if you like survival films"
" Not what I expected. In a good way.
",0.4404,0.9813,2020-09-30 00:00:00,8,"I barely glanced at the marketing for this film and my mind was already made up: ""Oh, no! Not another Moby Dick film. I've seen some. I may have even read the book (not really) and I can't remember. Do something bloody original for once, Hollywood!"". But the movie is not about Moby Dick, but about the real story of the sinking of the Essex which famously inspired Herman Melville in writing the dicky book. And this means you get more realism, no over dramatization - well, not in the sense of the original book, but also a slightly less satisfying ending.The actors did a good job, the sea visuals are great and, considering the rather lackluster source material by Nathaniel Philbrick, better than average. Yet it lacked something. I didn't feel the majesty of the sea or felt any kinship with either character, be them human or whale. It was a dramatic story of seamen stranded in the middle of the sea. No morals, no greater message. Also no image of heroic people overcoming adversity. And keep in mind that this film had in it Spiderman, Thor and Benjen Stark!Bottom line: a nice ocean period movie, but not inspiring in any way."

" Prestigious Historical Drama
",0.0,0.9497,2020-09-02 00:00:00,7,In the Heart of the Sea tells the story that inspired the classic novel Moby Dick. In the Heart of the Sea had a terrific cast and was directed by Ron Howard. I personally enjoy Ron Howard's historical films but In the Heart of the Sea was a lesser entry in that genre. The film had some great special effects and thrilling sequences where the characters hunt a whale. But the film suffers when it turns into a shipwreck story because even if hard to be stranded at sea it's also monotonous. It is still worth a watch because of the setting and the action: it is on Amazon Prime in the UK at the time of writing.
" We're going to need a bigger...attention span.
",0.0,-0.6597,2020-09-02 00:00:00,5,"Man wants captaincy, doesn't get it. Captain orders ship into storm. Ship gets wet. Man see big fish. Man catch big fish. All go wrong. Bigger fish smash 'em up. Lost at sea. Then not. Go home. What a soulless film."
" Too much Melville
",0.0,-0.8943,2020-08-21 00:00:00,6,"A well-told story with exciting thought-provoking plot and interesting characters, and great visual effects. That said, Chris Hemsworth didn't seem right for the role, a bit too magazine-model handsome and with an odd accent. What bothered me about the film, however, was its reliance on the Herman Melville connection, the author's reaching out to Thomas Nickerson, an elderly survivor thirty years after the tragic sinking of the Essex, to get the ""real"" story (an attack by a giant white whale, not grounding on a reef, as reported, caused the ship's destruction). Considering all the dramatic and gory details which the old mariner relates to Melville, when ""Moby Dick"" was finally published, all the author seemed to have borrowed from the Essex is the character of a vengeful white whale, bent on the destruction of whaling ships and their crews. The audience is expected to think, ""Hey, that's where Melville got his idea!"" But in reality, there were several killer white whales that attacked ships during that era and their existence was well known. ""Moby Dick"" contains so much more, much of it gleaned from Melville's own experiences as a crew member aboard a whaling ship, but also from other sources, like the Bible and Shakespeare."

" Great action entertainment
",0.7845,0.862,2020-08-02 00:00:00,8,"The story is very well told, the acting is convincing, the smattering of technical effects with moving whales and stunt battling scenes show themselves impressive, all of this encased in the colorful imagery of the ocean landscape create an end product that results in a very compelling poignant action movie"
" Even though I am a huge fan of Hemsworth....
",0.5574,0.9866,2020-07-16 00:00:00,5,"I struggled with this one. I love action and I love adventure and so this should be the perfect movie for me. On top of everything else my favourite actor is in it -Chris Hemsworth.I just couldn't find anything to hold on to - no interesting characters and I found myself wishing it would be over before the expedition even began.I love Master and Commander with Russell Crowe and I thought that if this is even remotely anything like that, I will love it. It was a mistake comparing the two of course, the only thing they have in common is that that everything happens on a ship at sea. This movie really had me thinking about why I like a movie and why I don't and I do think that even with all the action and adventure in the world, if there are no memorable characters it just doesn't do it for me. I want to feel like I want to get to know the characters and be in the movie with them kind of thing.I regret watching this because not only did I not enjoy the movie from an entertainment point of view, but now I feel sad about the whales. Maybe that was the sole purpose of the movie and if that is the case then mission accomplished. But then I would have rather watched a documentary.I don't even know why I am giving this a 5 because I could barely stand watching it until the end. I suppose it gets a 5 because it was a beautiful movie that was dealing with something important from the past.Hemsworth still looks kind of hot though and it upsets me that not even that could save this movie for me. I like him better in bad-ass movies such as Extraction and I think I'll go watch that again now."

Technically its very well made and if you like sea faring movies with nice visuals and such, you will probably like this one.The movie gives good time to get the viewer familiar with the characters and the story is well built in technical aspects, but it feels hollow. Theres too much focus on the main characters and few of their highlighted aspects.Simply as an adventure movie, its good watch, but if you want to see some meaningful movie that enchances your mind or makes you think, this is not the one. What it lacks is depth."

" Moby Dick meets Jaws
",-0.5106,-0.1531,2020-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Every cliche under the sun - cheesy script, ropy acting, one-dimensional characterisation - but good to look at, especially the first hour which contains some truly terrifying scenes of early whaling in mountainous seas. Second half becomes faintly ridiculous as the crew are stalked by a psycho whale which we are invited to believe bears a grudge..."
" Dramatic and powerful deviation from Moby Dick
",-0.128,0.8902,2020-06-29 00:00:00,7,"In the Heart of the Sea is intended to be the true story that inspired the book Moby Dick, and from what little I know of that novel, I think this is a deviation from what Melville wrote (Not that it bothered me.) It tells the story of a group of whalers in the 1800s who run into some troubles when they are confronted by a giant white whale that is too much for them to handle. I found the movie quite intriguing as it shows how whale-hunting worked back in those days, and then showed the risks that could come with the work. It certainly helped that they cast so many great actors in the film, because they were able to elevate what could have been a more run-of-the-mill adventure on the high seas. It is brutal and hard to watch at times, but I think that's the point of the story. Aside from some of the more unpleasant things that happen in the film, it was also hard to watch at times because the CGI left something to be desired. I know filming on the water is a logistical nightmare, and they certainly can't train a bunch of whales of this size, so CGI was the only way to go with a lot of these shots. I only wish they had spent a bit more time making some of these effects seamless. They are able to hide some of it with darkness and rain, but there are many scenes where the artificiality of everything threatened to take me out of the movie.I thought it was interesting what they decided to include when writing In the Heart of the Sea, because there is an ending to the story that feels final enough to be satisfying. However, the movie doesn't just want to explore the disaster that occurs in the film, but also how corporations would handle this kind of thing. (Hint: it's not all that different than how corporations would act now, as they are always looking out for their bottom line.) I like that added layer to the story, and it made the film seem more relevant. I think one of the reasons that this movie didn't do so well in theaters is that people expected the whale to be a central figure in the story, and they expected Chris Hemsworth to be a pseudo-Captain Ahab, since it results in the book we know as Moby Dick. However, In the Heart of the Sea is more concerned with the crew, and the whale is merely a mechanism to get events moving forward. Perhaps that's why a later scene, when things have somewhat changed between the crew and the white whale, felt a bit awkward and out-of-place. It seemed like they were trying to make the whale more of a character in that moment, which I don't think they earned. Otherwise, I was whole-heartedly invested in this film, and I think In the Heart of the Sea was a good surprise that was better than the reviews implied."

The time and the survivor in those boats for so so many days... the non sense ideas of the captain in the beginning... the whale following them for thousands and thousands of miles in the sea. Maybe a lot of these things are better in the movies(I didnt read).But it's great movie, and I think that was a good experience to watch and I liked it. I just think that could have been better."
" Flawed, but nonetheless a good yarn.
",0.5927,0.9584,2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"After reading several reviews here, a few things stand out about this film. The most glaring, is Hemsworth's own performance, which was described as ""underdeveloped "" by a few, and I must agree. The off again, on again New English accent, the lack of development of his family life, and his relationship with Captain Pollard not being anywhere near the level of personal conflict that made ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and every one of it's remakes so entertaining. This is curious, because so much time was spent on Herman Melville's request of the seaman who saw it all.
The omission of seafaring shanties was a real disappointment. Even the original ""Moby Dick,"" with Gregory Peck had a few, and they certainly lent a sense of realism to what you are watching, not to mention that many shanties were catchy songs.
I found Cillian Murphy's character woefully underused, in just about every way. He may as well not have been in the film. His presence didn't add anything.
The idea of cannibalism is, and has historically been, something that is so abhorrent, no one who commits it, can ever escape it's shame. That both Hemsworth's character and Captain Pollard, in particular, escaped it, detracted somewhat to the film, but the one thing I absolutely laud this film for, is it's defense of ethics, morals and honor. Both captain and First Mate held true to those principles, regardless of the consequences, but at the end of the film, stand head and shoulders above everyone in Nantucket.It's actually a good morality tale to be told, in this time, the time of Covid 19, and 21st century's worthless politicians who, like the slimebag businessmen in Nantucket, care of nothing for anything or anyone, but profit, even over the things that define them as human beings. If not for the previous list of flaws, this film might have gotten eight or nine stars."

" Your time would be much better spent reading the documented books on the ESSEX.
",0.4404,0.5119,2020-04-13 00:00:00,2,"A disappointing piece of work. I don't generally like movies that put false political spins on history. I like Ron Howard personally and professionally but I didn't like this effort. Bad CGI made this even more unwatchable. There are three documented reports about the sinking of the ESSEX and the following epic survival story: One by the captain, one by the first officer, and one by the young cabin boy. I discount the latter as seen through the eyes of a child and with the knowledge & understanding of a child. There were many false representations throughout the movie: The captain was not a bumbling entitlist novice captain and there wasn't a war between the captain and first officer. There were only two crewmen on board when the white whale attacked the ESSEX, the cook and the cabin boy. The white whale only struck the ship twice. The white whale did not follow the crew after the shipwreck. There was not a conspiracy to cover up the incident. And the whale boats were not 'inadequate'. They were well designed and as close to perfect as anything man can make to be functional whale boats. Your time would be much better spent reading the documented books on the ESSEX."
" Surprisingly interesting
",0.5994,0.9923,2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"This film is based on Philbrick's novel, which chronicles the voyage of the whaling ship Essex, which was destroyed by a giant white whale in eighteen twenty. Herman Melville partially based his famous book Moby Dick off these very same events. In the Heart of the Sea combines these two elements together in a dramatic and action-packed adventure which while historically inaccurate, is still great fun to watch if you do not look for these faults.In eighteen fifty, Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) has arrived to speak with old Tom Nickerson (a gruff Gleeson), the last surviving member of the Essex, agreeing to pay him a sum of money for his account of the ill-fated Essex's journey and subsequent sinking. Tom is reluctant to recall the events but after persuasion from his wife he agrees to tell Melville everything. Melville is excited to hear the tale first-hand, and is confident that his notes will enable him to succeed the success of his first novel.We then move back in time to just before the Essex sets sail. Owen Chase (Hemsworth) is to be offered the role of first mate. He is not happy about this, previously being promised a captaincy in the past. The captain will be George Pollard (Walker), who's family own the shipping industry in Nantucket. Owen's wife is pregnant and also unhappy, but due to the prospected length of time he will be away at sea, citing that Owen is too much like his father who never saw his child.The Essex sets off on her voyage and we see the crew at work. That evening Pollard does his best to try and get under Owen's skin, thinking himself above Chase. Tensions between the two will quickly escalate as Chase, being the bigger man, leaves for the crews quarters in order to issue commands and positions. It is shortly after this that a storm is spotted approaching the Essex.Now unlike in Moby Dick, which is really about a madman's obsession with catching a particular whale, this title does show what life was like on a whaling ship and the brutality involved. I personally despise whaling and In the Heart of the Sea shows the ugly side of this business, especially over one hundred and fifty years ago. Pretty it certainly isn't. But in the context of the film the scenes needed filming, though thankfully they are kept to a minimum for the squeamish.Along the same theme, the film also questions the ethics of what man does and gets slightly into the philosophic side of things regarding God, men and how significant we really are, or are not. Much has been said about the directing and the use of the CGI but I personally never found any real fault with the effects, and thought the quick shot direction helped to make you feel part of the crew and ship.Featuring some beautiful cinematography, visually this is a very impressive looking feature, the storm scene in particular is very well done. Script and acting are also likewise good as one would expect from this cast. Ultimately though this film was a massive flop at the box office, no doubt hindered by opening a week before The Force Awakens, which really would have killed any films chances of success, regardless of what it was. Whoever set the release date needs a long hard look at themselves.Unless you are well versed with real facts and dates etc regarding the fate of the Essex, this should be an enjoyable title for most people. Even for those people who know the history though, enjoy the film as presented, if you want facts then go and watch a documentary. Solid acting, good direction and epic set pieces make this a good film worth watching, even if it doesn't reach greatness. For that, dig out your copy of Moby Dick.

What I got instead was one of the most boring movies of 2015. (I know it's 2016 at the time of writing this review, but this film was released in 2015.) I thought Chris Hemsworth would at least be able to save this film, but nope. While his acting isn't terrible, he does have inconsistency in his accents. 1/3 of a sentence will be Austrailain, the next 1/3 will be British, and the last 1/3 will be American. (And not even necessarily in that order.) It's very distracting. I can see why the story of ""Moby Dick"" had to be changed and exaggerated, because no one would stay invested if this was the story that was published. This movie is a huge snoozer.

" The start of Moby-Dick...
",0.0,0.9962,2020-03-28 00:00:00,6,"""In the Heart of the Sea"" is an Action - Biography movie in which we watch a group of sailors in 1820 trying to capture a giant whale for its oil but their ship is complete destroyed by it and now they have to survive. This experience was the starting point of the great novel Moby-Dick.I enjoyed this movie because it was very interesting and had many good action scenes. In addition to this, the direction which was made by Ron Howard was exceptional and I liked the way he presented the struggle of the sailors and also the evolution of some of the characters of the movie. Regarding the interpretations, I have to mention Chris Hemsworth's who played as Owen Chase, Benjamin Walker's who played as George Pollard and Tom Holland's who played as Thomas Nickerson and they were all simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Brendan Gleeson's who played as Tom Nickerson and Cillian Murphy's who played as Matthew Joy and they both gave a different touch in the movie. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you will enjoy it and you won't be bored at all. It's a nice afternoon movie to spend your time with."

" Impressively underwhelming...
",0.4588,0.3616,2020-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Impressively underwhelming, given its subject matter, and the ensemble telling the story. But, there was almost no chemistry between either, and that's what makes it even more appalling when you remember the director is Ron Howard. How could this have become so blasé? I'm taking a stab at guessing the studio interfered? Hoping that's the case? The special effects are generally adequate, or sufficient. Weird that from just 12 years earlier, 'Master and Commander' still holds up so well by comparison."
" Not the true story
",-0.3252,0.6793,2020-02-24 00:00:00,6,"This was a nice work of fiction. Great scenes on the ship and atcsea, excting and engaging. But it bore little more resemblance to the trurxstory ( as told in the book by Philbrick) than did Moby Dick. The ship used in the film was 2 masted, the Essex was small bur 3 masted and larger. The story of the whale chasing the noats is for weeks after sinking the Essex was complete fabrication. Sojeone should make a movie of the true story. Oh, and Melville never interviewed a survivor. The true account was well known."

" Barracking for the Whales!
",0.0,0.988,2020-01-31 00:00:00,6,"It's a Ron Howard film, so the expectation therefore will be that in the Heart of the Sea will be a very professional production with a strong cast and a good story to tell. On the first and second counts it succeeds, but unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, the storyline this time around is pretty dull. Unexpected, because the screenplay by Charles Leavitt is based on one of those truth is stranger than fiction stories; in this case, Nathaniel Philbrick's non-fiction book of the same name, about the sinking of the American whaling ship Essex in 1820, an event that inspired the novel Moby-Dick. It follows that much of what we see is the recreated truth behind the world famous Melville tale. Indeed the framing device for the telling of the story is a fictional meeting between Herman Melville and one of the surviving Essex crew members, Thomas Nickerson.In the Heart of the Sea won only mixed critical response and was a commercial flop. I see the main problem being that no matter how good a film, contemporary audiences aren't all that interested in seeing ship loads of whalers going out to kill whales, no matter how adventurous it sounds (especially being set in the early 19th century), nor how good the CGI effects are in playing out the human vs cetaceans battles. Unlike 19th (where the film does reflect the historical importance of whale by-products) and 20th (to an extent) century populations, most of the world is simply over whale-hunting. So we end up with an unbalanced film, where Chris Hemsworth tries to play a somewhat heroic and principled first mate Owen Chase, but at the same time wants to go out and slaughter whales to get a cargo load of oil. It makes for uncomfortable viewing, putting aside the fact that the real life character was unlikely to be anywhere near as charismatic, as portrayed here. You end up well and truly rooting for the ""demon sperm whale"", who causes major calamities for the crew of the Essex, captained by George Pollard, who is played by a far too easily overshadowed Benjamin Walker.There's plenty of drama, including PG - rated cannibulism amidst a narrative that does generally stick to the main historical facts. But the end product is never likely to spark audience reactions to the same extent, that Melville's literary masterpiece and indeed the 1956 Gregory Peck led filmed adaption of Moby Dick did. Oddly the pre-closing credit notes regarding Hemworth's Owen Chase are totally wrong. They claim that he gave up whaling and became a successful merchant sea captain, when he actually remained a whaler for just about all his sea-faring life."

No switching back to land to hear from their whiny families like every other movie does. Imagine if JAWS kept cutting back to the shore constantly once they boarded the Orca.It would have been awful. Ron Howard and Chris Hemsworth did two unbelievable movies together, 'Heart of the Sea' and 'Rush.' No less than a 10 out of 10 rating."

One doesn't get a sense of the delirium of being stranded a sea for months at a time and they look far too fit to start resorting to poor diet choices.Usually Ron Howard films are pretty decent even if they barely cover expenses. This one falls way off the mark in both areas. OK for an afternoon, with pauses for naps. Don't save it for evening entertainment though."
" A solid adventure that should have dropped the Moby Dick connection
",-0.1027,0.9874,2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,"They should not have included the connection to Moby Dick. I thought it was just a marketing gimmick, but Herman Melville is a character and the impetus for the overall framing device. I imagine that it's true that Melville used the story of the ""Essex"" as partial inspiration for his grand opus (perhaps the greatest novel written in the English language, in my humble opinion), but is that necessary information to tell the story that enticed him in the first place? The story of the ""Essex"" is interesting on its own. It doesn't need Herman Melville to help tell it, but maybe that was the point. ""No one will care about a story of a whaling ship in 1820, but if you add Moby Dick to the marketing, you'll get  in seats. All the kids love Moby Dick!""That's really my only explanation for why Melville was included. They needed to help sell the narrative and the film overall to skeptical audiences who might not be interested in a story of a whaler from 200 years ago, but no one cares about Moby Dick other than me and other nerds. I can't imagine the addition added much in terms of box office since it was such a dud there anyway.Moving on, though. The Melville sections that largely bookend the story (and pop up from time to time in the middle) are fine on their own. Well acted and photographed, so at least there's that. Inside the actual story, though, we do have a compelling narrative that's about more than just a whale. And that's where I think the Melville sections undermine the whole movie. The story of the ""Essex"" is about more than just a giant, angry, and vengeful sperm whale. It's the story of a crew sent on a dangerous mission where most died and the few that did survive only did so through the most extreme of circumstances and methods. The men involved are interesting, especially the central conflict between the untested Captain that comes from a naval family and the experienced first mate who comes from a family of landsmen. It's a clash of personalities and hubris that carries the movie quite well.The movie also looks good. It doesn't go for strict realism, instead we have a more painterly vision of the aesthetics of life at sea. The waves almost look like they have brushstrokes guiding them. The lighting is always used to maximum effect with the sun popping up in just the right place for a pretty view, even in the face of total destruction. I really like how the movie almost had an oil painting look from beginning to end, although the Melville segments are far more darkly and realistically shot.Overall, I finally got into the movie after the whale attack, which was about halfway through the movie. From then on, I was completely on board, enjoying the tale of desperation and survival that was the ""Essex"" looking for rescue. Perhaps the movie could have been great, but I do think that it ended up distracted at times, but ultimately good."
" Utterly disappointing...a rare swing and miss for Ron Howard
",-0.1531,0.6407,2019-11-20 00:00:00,1,"Oh where to begin to review this steaming turd of a movie. We've come to expect so much from Ron Howard, but he really missed the mark on this one. The actual true story is so incredibly riveting, that nothing had to be done, but put it up on the silver screen for all to behold. There was no love story. There was no blue-blood vs. working man conflict. The captain of the ship in reality had paid his dues and earned his position....a position on an old, beat-up vessel. What about the story of torching the Galapagos islands after collecting three Galapagos islands tortoises...there's a story within a story, and a good one at that! How about the fact that over half of the crew on this ship would have been of dark complexion (and wasn't 2015 the year there wasn't a single black Oscars nominee?? What a missed opportunity.) What about the dynamic between the fortunate class of connected Nantucket blue-bloods vs. the less fortunate non-Nantucket crew, and how that played out on the whale boats after the ship sank? How about explaining the effort of salvaging goods from a sinking Whale Ship? How about the decision to sail East to death vs West to the Marqueses or Hawaiian Islands because the crew thought there were still cannibals living out there? So much wasted potential traded for a convoluted, confusing, go-nowhere, CGI-bloated piece of bleeeeech. Ron Howard! C'mon!!!!"
" Whale kills humans - awesome!
",0.2244,-0.4538,2019-11-13 00:00:00,7,Surprisingly good film that dramatizes the real events around Moby Dick. The beginning of this film is kinda goofy and the special effects look sorta fake - but once the humans start to kill whales its actually pretty eye opening into how dangerous and awful that industry was back then. When the whale attacks there are some pretty great action scenes as the whale tears the human's boat to shreds by using its body as a battering ram and its tale as a bullwhip. I rooted the the whale the whole movie - and wasn't disappointed.
" One of My Favorite Movies
",0.4588,0.9796,2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,"This movie definitely makes it on my top 10 list. I originally watched this movie because some of my favorite actors (Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland, I know I'm a basic white girl) were in the movie. I can now easily say that even though they are great as Spider-Man and Thor, this is my favorite work of both actors. They retold a story of these brave sailors in a new and innovative way. The acting is impeccable and when watching interviews with the actors you can see how much dedication was put into making this movie. Having to starve yourself to do justice to a character isn't easy work. I would 100% recommend to anyone who loves a action/adventure movie!"

It represents the sinking of the Essex in very stark accuracy and doesn't pull any punches, save for sparing the audience the pain of having to actually watch one of its most intense scenes. (I'm sure the details are in the parental guide). The acting is good, the effects are actually quite good as well, and, as I said, is historically very accurate.

So, my questions about this movie are: Why assign the brilliant and superb Cillian Murphy to such a small role, and then why make his hair that awful color? Unnecessary. If you enjoy him in Peaky Blinders, watch him in The Wind that Shakes the Barley as well as Anthropoid."

The story is inaccurate. In the account of the actual tragedy the whale only strikes the Essex when it initially sinks and it becomes a survival story from there. It was a good try, but no."

I do not recommend watching this movie. Instead go watch Moby Dick with Gregory Peck great fantastic Art.While the movie is bad there is one reviewer here who has rated the movie as one star and disgusting just because its about whaling or killing whales. Well idiot if you don't like whaling don't watch the movie. Reviewing the movie means watching it and then rating it about how well it depict and portrayed the content.

" It's A Shame
",-0.4767,0.9886,2019-07-08 00:00:00,6,"It is truly a shame how bad this film is, when you have read the novel beforehand. I read it when it came out; over a dozen years before Ron Howard tried, but failed miserably in his film. The sinking of ""The Essex"" was to the 19th Century, what the ""Titanic"" sinking was to the 20th Century. Not in the loss of life (of course), but the sheer magnitude of the story. Most people (by far) had never heard of The Essex before ""The Heart of the Sea"" book came out. I am glad they kept the name of the book to use for the film. When reading, one almost cannot stop until finishing, it is such a brilliant book. As far as the film, the special effects are very good. The cast is quite good, although the accents and dialogue leave much to be desired. I think the screenplay takes far too much time on Melville interviewing Mr. Nickerson. After all, this is without a doubt one of the best non-fiction novels I have ever read. A real stunner. I am not a huge fan of Ron Howard, but I respect his talent, when it is shown. Unfortunately, that does not occur here. Perhaps visually it is good, but that is it. I gave it an average rating (a 5); however, the book would get a 9 out of 10, easily."

Perhaps develop some relationships and then threaten them like the friendship with first mate and Captain OR first mate and boy OR cousin of captain and old friend of first mate... and then mix in some threat to add a little conflict beyond the tidbits they give you (ie., the politics of handing a captaincy to a Name, snore). They could have gone a bit Lord of the Flies as well, to spice it up. Or a YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH! courtroom scene.But alas, no. Just a straightforward story narrated by an old man.

However,if you manage to avert the bias on account of this being connected to the classic , you will find it to be quite enjoyable . With breathtaking visuals , apt direction and a matching cinematography , the movie manages to put you in the Essex (well , to a great extent actually ) and let you feel both the excitement and the horrors of a whaler in 1800s.
However , since this is the story which inspired the tale of Moby Dick comparisons are bound to be made . Of course , the movie lacks the traits of becoming a classic like novel. It lacked the depth of the characters as penned down so eloquently by Herman Melville but then Melville had the liberty to fictionalize and to contour the novel in its final shape using his brilliant imagination. Ron Howard unfortunately had just reality to work with. And yet despite the lack of intensity we find in Moby Dick, the storytelling was quite good and the performances equally praiseworthy . It is movies like this and Rush which make me believe that soon we might have an awesome actor in Chris Hemsworth.All in all the movie is definitely an above average , far from what many negative reviews are letting you believe . Give it a chance . It is more than likely that you won't regret it."

The special effects weren't awful and the cinematography was cool. Chris Hemsworth was cool to watch. The captain was decent. I was surprised that Tom Holland was in the film, he did a fine job.

" Captain THOR Reporting For Duty...
",0.0,0.9949,2019-01-10 00:00:00,4,"Set in New England 1820, Chris Hemsworth (best know for Thor) plays Owen Chase, a whale hunter for a career, stud of a husband and of course a soon to be father. In case you didn't know, this film is inspired the great novel Moby-Dick.Owen is the reluctant 2nd in command of a ship (when he was hoping for the position of thy captain) and now takes orders from someone he's never worked with and trusted before. The captain, 2nd in charge (Christ Hemsworth) and crew not only struggle with each other's choices and trust issues, but the crew must also deal with a large Whale which is bigger than anything they have ever seen. The large whale of course enjoys to torment....Having seen the film movie trailers in advance, the trailers really gave me the impression the main focus of this film would be the large whale and big battle at sea when in fact, I feel this film's story is more aimed about the men in the boat.Our film starts with something we've seen far too often. A man who travels far around the world seeking another man's story that only he can tell, the traveller writing it down word for word and will be sure to tell the world. Sigh.You find straight away there is no real reason for these characters from the get go. This does't change as the film goes back and forth as if we were curious about how our story teller is going (face palm). I'll warn you early. The film's pacing is very S L O W and the film's characters are D U L L.The main highlight of the film is the picture and audio. The picture is clean and colour is bright/crisp but the price is you can tell when the green screen is in use- which has been used in huge amounts. When we see a group of men in a boat it's pretty easy to tell what's real and what's fake in every shot.The audio is a winner on bluray with an outstanding and enjoyable effects. The sound of our whale provides many great shakes and rattles as it torments our confused crew members.The film's story I'm shocked to say really disappointed me. We have many characters continuing arguing like children and at times we go in circles and side plots which I feel the movie would have flowed much better without.This film has no re-watch value or new experiences. If you seek a good film set at the sea, I can suggest Master And Commander (Russell Crowe) or of course Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy?4.4/10

The Essex was a whaling ship that was sunk by a giant whale and one of the survivors told a writer a story that became Moby Dick. The story was well told and very believable. I do not know that much about the Essex but the actor stayed true to the feel of the movie. Compared to actual Moby Dick adaptations this movie is better. Tom Holland plays the kid who does not know what he is doing while Chris Hemsworth plays an experienced whaling sailor. Both do a great job. This movie is really good and I recommend it to any who have even heard of Moby Dick.

",0.0,0.8491,2018-10-09 00:00:00,9,"Out of all the movies I've watched in history through film this was probably my favorite one. the actors were good, the story was good, and the film was visually pleasing. I liked where it took place and when. Honestly i don't have a single bad thing to say about it. I think how they have the old man telling his story to the writer and what we are seeing is a flashback is a pretty dope concept. It is done in many movies but they pulled it off well in this one. I will say that say that since it is a flashback it confuses you since its showing a different guys life that he would never be able to see as a flashback in certain parts of the movie but you get over that and get lost in the movie. i love the part when they go into the storm i love when they hunt the whales and the part where the big whale destroys there boat and kills some of them . To me this movie really makes you think about what is right and wrong and how things were morally different back in that time period."

 What i noticed about the movie that it was very well filmed and produced. It fit in with its time. Moby dick was a big book during that time. I've seen movies about moby dick in the past. There are characters in the movie that i have seen in other movies. I liked the filming, I liked the story line, and I liked how big the whale was. I didn't like the whale color.
 The movie was good. They filmed it well and it had a good story line. It was about as whale. They were killing whales for oil to power the lamps."
" Giant Whale
",0.0,0.9863,2018-10-08 00:00:00,8,I watched this movie in a history class. We watch a lot of historic movies in this class. It is about a man that tells his story about being on a boat. The boat gets attacked by a giant whale. Most of the men do not make it. But he is the only person alive from the boat. A man writes the mans story and he makes Moby Dick. The movie was made recently so the effects of the movie are pretty good. The actors that they got for this movie are good. They are good at telling somebody else story. The historical accuracy wasn't that bad. They had to get oil in this time period and it was from whales. There wasn't any other connections to movies that I noticed in this movie. I liked the acting in this movie it made the movie seem more realistic. I liked the scenes where they would hunt the whales. It was a good part when the survivors got back to the main land. I didn't like how they ate the people that died on the small boats. The movie was very well made it I liked it. The movie was the best movie we've watched in our history class. I would like to watch other movies made with the same actors and director.

I liked how they did the records and sound affects and how everything was just filmed. And this movie got me hyped because it was like the other movies we watched in the classroom, this was more action and newer year. I liked how the whale kept attacking them because it just made the movie better. I question how would a whale be that big and if the whales before him were bigger."
" Whale this is it.
",0.0,0.5634,2018-10-01 00:00:00,8,"The reason I watched this film was to learn more about the story of Moby Dick. This movie has an interesting plot and includes many of the historical events that took place during this time period to the men in this film. The story begins with a man attempting to get Thomas, a member from the crew attacked by Moby Dick, to tell the story so he can write about it. The man eventually obliges and goes into the story. The main character Owen (Chris Hemsworth) is very skilled at whale hunting and becomes the first mate of the crew, although, he should have been captain. The captain was not as skilled or experienced as Owen and causes a lot of turmoil through his bad decision making. The ship gets destroyed by a giant whale and they get stranded on an island. They realize they have no chance of making it out alive if they don't attempt to leave so they set off on tiny boats. They go through many sacrifices, including cannibalism. There are many life lessons throughout the film and trust is a major value portrayed. Overall this movie had a great story and a good ending. It was very well executed in the filming, acting and plot. This film has stuck with me more than the others we have watched in the class which could be due to the fact it has Tom Holland in it, however, it was an all around great film."
" stop bashing this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",-0.5216,0.5083,2018-10-01 00:00:00,10,"For never reading the book I found this movie to be quite entertaining. who would've thought that a giant whale could sink a giant ship? After doing a little research on the actual events that inspired the story, I found a few details that were incorrect, that's okay. the movie was pretty great.
Now, for all you people that have been bashing this movie, shut up and listen for a minute. This isn't Moby Dick. It wasn't supposed to be. It's the story of how the Essex sank and the inspiration for the book. Maybe I shouldn't say anything because I've never read the book, but just know that I ENJOYED THAT MOVIE!!!!!!!! 
Now, about the storyline. It was a movie full of twists and turns. The Captain made me angry, but thats okay. I kinda wish he hadn´t survived because he had no idea how to sail a darned ship and therefore, shouldn't have survived because he didn't deserve to. Because of the Captain´s incompetence, the ship was sailed directly into a storm and almost sank more than once. May this be a lesson for anyone who assigns Captains to ships, don't let them be Captain just because their family has a lot of money. It's a recipe for disaster. Find Captains that know what they're doing. If the person has never even sailed a boat, don't let them captain it. What the heck were those people thinking?! They should've let Owen Chase be the captain. He'd sailed before. He knew what he was doing and they wouldn't have sailed into a freaking storm if Chase was the captain. Maybe they would've been at sea longer but at least they wouldn't have been inches from DEATH!!"

For a while they don't find any whales but then eventually do, then they come across the biggest whale they've ever seen, bigger than their ship, they try to capture it but the whale attacks them and their ship, destroying their ship, they are left with three small boats, they are stranded in the ocean fighting for survival that even leads to cannibalism. I thought this movie was interesting because it had to do with oil in whales that people wanted.

This was there source of lighting. While on the journey they lose many men due to illness. They come across the biggest whale they have seen and it destroys the boat. They then are left adrift and have to survive. They will do anything to survive. I thought the acting was spot on. They did a good job with the special effectsl. It made it seem like I was actually on the boat. The huge whale looked realistic and the technology used was good. The only thing that made me question the accuarcy was the whale size I thought it was bigger than the movie portrayed. And how they could survive off of nothing. The only connection I have to this movie is the actors. Ive seen most of them before. I liked the actors they picked good people. I liked the story it was well told and very exciting. It was also cool to see they made it alive. I didnt like the beginnng of the movie I felt it dragged on. The movie overall was very good. I thought it was interesting and I would reccomend it. I would like to see movies with the same director he did a good job. I would also like to see more of the actors they were really good and made the movie what it is.
" Almost perfect.
",0.5279,0.9843,2018-09-25 00:00:00,8,"So, Hemsworth seems to have a different accent from moment to moment... and none of them sound like he's from Nantucket. So what?! No one other than Fairley seems to be able to pull the accent off very well. The score, while very good, is derivative. The film has its problems. ""In The Heart of The Sea"" is nevertheless a very good film. The sets, costumes and effects are remarkable. The directing is strong, and although choppy at times, it spares the viewer from what easily could have been a long, slow slog had the director taken this film too seriously. It is, after all, a story about whalers sailing around the world and not catching anything for more than a year. A les ""epic"" approach almost certainly would have been very, very boring. I liked this film a good deal. If you're a fan of historic films like I am, this is a worthwhile movie. Although maybe not providing the most accurate historic information, Howard definitely provides an interpretation that is both entertaining and believable."
" Thor and the Whale

A group of men go out to sea and their ship gets attacked by a giant whale while they were hunting other whales. The movie goes on to show their survival out on sea with little to no supplies and what they had to do to eventually get back home. I thought there were some great performances and overall, the acting was good. There was also some good visuals here and there throughout the film. Sometimes the green/blue tint seemed a little harsh, but other than that it was good. This was the first movie I've seen that depicts these events so I didn't have a lot to compare it to. I know that there some parts that weren't historically accurate, but it is a Hollywood movie and I'd imagine they spice it up for entertainment value. I didn't really like the time jumping element. Throughout the story, it would cut to an older Thomas recounting the events to Herman Melville. I felt that it took away from the suspense of the main story. It would make you lose interest when you're so invested in the main story line, and it suddenly cuts off to something else for a couple minutes of people just talking. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. There were very few parts that I disliked and I found it very interesting. I've seen others movies and shows directed by Ron Howard and I've enjoyed those as well. I'm sure I will see other things done by him later on."
" Moby Dick the movie

The filmmaker was telling a story about a crew and a whale. He wanted to show how the Cpt. and 1st man hated each other but managed to get along. He wanted to show what the crew had to go through. Why the whale was attacking them and how if they didn't attack it, it would leave them be. I recognized this was a recent movie because of how well done the special effects were. I also recognized the actors because they're present day people. There wasn't anything that made me question it's accuracy. Although I'm sure there's small things that can be picked out. No, I can't say I can make a connection with superheros killing fish in any other movie. I liked how well the actors preformed. The amount of time that i could tell went into the special effects. And well the locations looked where it was filmed. I didn't like how Thor chose not to stab the fish in the eye. I liked how well the movie was put together. I enjoyed the movie and I liked how it was the first that i saw. Yes i would like to see movies with the same actors and director."

" In the ""Art"" of the Sea
",0.0,0.9932,2018-09-24 00:00:00,9,"Ron Howard's ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a great retelling of the story from 1820 that inspired the novel Moby Dick. Please keep in mind that if you watch this movie, it is not telling the direct story of Moby Dick, but merely goes back even further to the actual real life story the novel is based on. For a movie made in 2015, the effects and visuals are pretty solid. There are a few scenes in the ocean where either the framing wasn't quite right or it didn't look real enough. These few shots make the ocean look like nothing but a big Hollywood filming tank with this boat full of old timey dressed men in the middle of it. Other than this, the whole film is excellently well executed. The rivalry between the captain and Mr.Chase is very livid, the experiences of the whole crew are very very real. The visuals, specfically with the water, the whales, and the boats are also extremely well done. There were a couple of times it looked like the water was a bit overdone in either lighting or effects, but otherwise good. The casting for this movie was very good as well. All of the actors seemed to fill their roles well. Chris Hemsworth already has the kind of over commanding, prideful personality in person so to see him in this role was very welcoming. 
All in all, this movie was great. I know it has its rough spots but it pulls on the jeart strings in a few places."

I think this movie is much more enjoyable then any other movie we have watched so far.The movie is all about how the novel ""Moby Dick"" was written. I'm not sure if the book was actually written this way or if they show it this way to be more entertaining.Most of the movie is a flashback of the youngest crew member of the whaling ship. This makes the movie a little confusing but it' not hard to understand. The young boy, who is no longer young, explains to a writer the events that unfolded upon the Essex whaling ship.I really enjoyed the acting of Mr. Chase, the first mate of the ship. In the movie he was portrayed as a very strong leader and wise individual. He used his knowledge to keep everyone alive and safe during the dangerous events."

This story is told by the boy when he is older and is confessing all that he did to survive. This movie has good acting and special effects. This is probably because it is a newer movie. I liked how it ended with George telling the truth about the whale that sunk their ship. I also liked how they brought a plot twist about cannablism into the movie. I didn't like how it started with whale oil making people rich. But over all, this movie is very entertaining and has an emotional impact on you."

The main character Owen (Chris Hemnsworth) had a specialty in whale spearing and took side along with the captain. The captains role seemed as more he was afraid of taking lead and action towards situations and it seemed as if many were doing his job for him. There are many life lessons and values of trust throughout the film and and overall had a great story and a good ending. Cannabalism also took place towards the end of the movie as the men had no food or water to last, which is also why towards the end, there are only a few men left out of the many that there was."

Watching the graphic whale blubber collection and discussing of cannibalism isn't usually a fancy I take to but this director did it in a not horrible way. The actors did extremely well for the task at hand, showing starvation, dehydration, and madding men at a scale level that seems as though the director put them through this experience. Compared to other movies I have recently watched I feel as though this one was meant for the adventurers who would dream of this while reading the book this was based upon Molby Dick. The over all historical content was there in the actions that stranded men would resort to in the last moment. The whale of the show is still under question. I feel as though I enjoyed this piece but it wouldn't be my first pick when Tom Holland goes into the blow hole of the beast."

There was a lot of good action points. It kept my attention the whole time. the ending was kind of boring. All in all i really liked this movie.

But the story of the young impressed me deeply: the young Thomas Nickerson, who survived to tell the story; and Henry Coffin, the faithful relative of Captain Pollard. Two strong characters, genuine, vulnerable, emotional. One fearful and humble; the other, an arrogant climber. The rest of the characters are stereotypes, buried under macho posing, cheap melodrama by courtesy of the female characters (how unfair, with all those weeping, boring hunks), gallons of unbearable music and tons of special effects.Apart from Nickerson and Coffin, I have to give credit to the powerful sinking sequence of the Essex, an effective evocation of people aboard a boat being hit by a giant sea creature."

If the intention was for viewers to feel some emotion with regard to what was said at the inquiry at the end then the film did not achieve that aim in my view, as it made no difference to me either way.For a far better tale of fishermen in the relatively recent past I would suggest Perfect Storm which drew me into the story completely."
" WE'RE YOUR FAMILY, FOR BETTER OR WORSE. MOSTLY WORSE.

This story was the inspiration for Melville's ""Moby Dick."" In the film Melville (Ben Whishaw) interviews the adult Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) who spends his time in a bottle and is reluctant to tell his tale of woe. However his fourth wife (Michelle Fairley) convinces him because of their pecuniary predicament. Thomas was a 14 year old ""Greenhorn"" (Tom Holland) at the time and tells the story as a conflict between the privileged captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) and a disgruntle first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) who was promised his own ship. As Pollard remarks, ""Some are born to the job, some born into it."" Thomas experiences his first ""Nantucket sleigh ride"" and gets to do all the dirty jobs.If you know the story they encounter a ""demon"" whale who hunts and haunts them.The story was well done and well acted if slightly inaccurate. Both Chase and Nickerson wrote accounts of the story and Melville used Chase's account for his inspiration. The interview appears to be fiction. There is a late emotional scene involving the Captain's cousin that wasn't quite accurate, but the results were the same.Good sea drama and half decent action flick."
" Old-fashioned adventure with an overload of CGI
",-0.0516,0.3681,2018-04-14 00:00:00,6,"IN THE HEART OF THE SEA is an energetic and old-fashioned high seas adventure directed by Ron Howard and based on the same true story that inspired Herman Melville to write MOBY DICK. Unfortunately this leads to an extensive framing narrative involving Brendan Gleeson's salty old sea-dog and Ben Whishaw playing Melville, seeking material for his next novel. At times the narrative will be in the heart of the action before jumping back to the present, but they should have dropped this flabby extension of the running time all together to focus on the main story. It's the usual tale of survival at sea against the odds, with a battle against an abnormally large whale making up the heart of the narrative. Unfortunately, Howard gets obsessed with CGI here and at times the film is nothing more than a series of shots of actors against a green screen interacting with CGI. Still, the human drama is quite engrossing, and the cast is surprisingly good; Hemsworth flexs his acting chops unshackled from THOR, while Cillian Murphy, Joseph Mawle, Tom Holland and Frank Dillane all get their moments to shine."

There really was an Essex, and it really was attacked by a whale, and the crew really did struggle for survival as they drifted, and the story of the Essex really was the inspiration for Herman Melville's novel ""Moby Dick."" All that is true enough. But the story told here takes a lot of liberties with what really happened to the Essex. Most importantly, the survivors of the Essex weren't stalked by one particular whale, as the movie suggests (although they were apparently later attacked by an orca.) But that aside (and I'm never too hard on movies ""based on a true story"" straying from the true story) ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" is an exciting, sea-faring adventure..Directed by Ron Howard, and starring Chris Hemwsorth as First Officer Chase and Benjamin Walker as Captain Pollard, this is really a movie that's more about human survival in desperate times. The movie is sympathetic to Chase and portrays Pollard as young and arrogant and the friction between the two is a significant part of the story. The truth is actually that it was Chase who made several mistakes that probably cost lives. But while the portrayal of that relationship may have been what drove this movie forward, basically, this is a movie about morality and how far we'll go to overcome the odds. In those ways, the movie is a good reflection on the plight of the Essex. For those who are expecting a sort of ""Jaws""-like adventure, where the whale is really the star of the show, this will be disappointing. Really, the actual attack by the whale (while very well depicted) doesn't take up all that much time in the movie. It's more the story of the crew and how they respond once the Essex sinks and they're left on the small whaling boats with little food or water and thousands of miles from the coast of South America. How far will they go to survive? It's presented as the reminiscences of Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) - a 14 year old member of the crew who reluctantly relates the story many years later to Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw), who supposedly uses Nickerson's memories as the basis for ""Moby Dick."" Whether Melville actually spoke to Nickerson I'm not sure, but I have read that before writing ""Moby Dick"" he did meet Chase's son, and after publishing ""Moby Dick"" he did meet Captain Pollard.Although most of the story is set on the Essex or its surviving whaleboats, I'd give credit to Gleeson for a very good performance. He captures the torment of Nickerson, who remains haunted 30 years later by his memories of what happened on that voyage on the Essex. In fact, I'd say generally that all the performances in this were good, and that Howard did a good job with directing.I wouldn't say that ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" (which was actually based on a book by Nathaniel Philbrick) rises to the level of a great movie, but it's certainly a movie that holds the attention of the viewer.

" Flawed, but Still Exciting and Entertaining
",0.8462,0.9941,2017-12-05 00:00:00,8,"Inspired by true events, Ron Howard's ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a literate, often exciting tale that is at once historical and informative, exciting and action filled, grueling and tragic. Charles Leavitt's well-written screenplay was based on a book by Nathaniel Philbrick, In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex, which purports to show the events that inspired Herman Melville to write Moby Dick. In the middle of the 19th century, the young Melville travels to Nantucket and seeks out the last survivor of the whaling ship Essex, which disappeared thirty years earlier with much controversy. After some persuasion and with enough cash, Melville, played by Ben Wishaw, convinces Brendan Gleeson as Tom Nickerson to relate the shocking story, which Nickerson has not even shared with his wife, played by Michelle Fairley. The film's acting honors go to the seasoned trio featured in the Melville-Nickerson scenes, which flash back to the story of the Essex as Gleeson relates the events.The actual tale of the Essex begins with Owen Chase, a strapping young seaman, who aspires to be captain of a whaler and has been promised a captaincy by the local shipowners. However, he is forced to accept first-mate status under an inexperienced captain, who has family connections. Chris Hemsworth certainly looks the part of Chase, a role that would have suited the young Sterling Hayden. Hemsworth's heroic looks, which at times resemble the youthful Nick Nolte, are perhaps too California-surfer to be convincing as a rugged seafarer. However, while he does have physical presence, a better actor could have deepened the characterization. The same comments apply to Benjamin Walker, who plays Chase's nemesis, Captain George Pollard, an untested captain who steers his ship and men carelessly into peril. Meanwhile, Cillian Murphy as Matthew Joy and Tom Holland as the young version of Nickerson provide able support among Pollard's crew.Set to a beautiful score by Roque Baños, the film features exciting whale-hunting scenes, a fierce storm at sea, and a harrowing tale of survival. However, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" illustrates the importance of a strong lead even in a film rich with special effects and action at sea. Without Russell Crowe, ""Master and Commander"" would not have succeeded as it did; with actors of Crowe's caliber in the roles of Chase and Pollard, the film could have been a titanic clash of wills set against the forces of nature in the guise of a monstrous whale. However, even with its flaws, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is fine entertainment, despite its failure to attain the heights to which director Howard aspired."
" This is an highly underrated movie
",0.0,0.7964,2017-11-25 00:00:00,10,"I cannot understand why it was a commercial failure. Great story script and casting. Some people can argue that the rhythm is a little bit slow. However, three months floating in a lifeboat seems to be almost impossible to bear. This is not an action movie. This is an history of tragedy, point-break, survival, honor, and a great homage to Herman Melville and his masterpiece, Moby Dick. Many people who didn't read yet the novel will be undoubtedly interested to do it after watching this movie."
" Moby Drek
",0.0,-0.8114,2017-11-22 00:00:00,2,"I'm a sailor and being a sailor I love sailing movies. I also loved Moby Dick, a book that's touching, humorous, thrilling and a deep exploration of the human condition. I was excited to finally get a chance to watch this film, thinking it was an adaptation of that great book. Within the first few lines of dialogue I thought, wait a minute, this writing is terrible. Then I realized this wasn't Moby Dick.The story of the Essex, the whaling ship that inspired Moby Dick, is a harrowing tale of survival. In the Heart of the Sea is not that story. Instead, it's a bland and meandering tale. I don't know how they managed to take a survival story with truly horrifying elements and reduced it to this CGI screensaver but I have some suspicions. Ron Howard should have been my first warning. He's a director that could make the Battle of Stalingrad feel like two hours waiting in a cafeteria line. It's truly appalling. Anyone who's been on a sailboat knows how dynamic the experience can be. They also know how sedate it can feel, as well. Howard focuses on the sedate. He truly has no idea what to do with drama and I can't understand how people keep letting him direct things. Instead of depth and subtlety, we get pedestrian and direct. Another problem is Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth is the perfect superhero actor. His ability to spout throwaway catchphrases is commendable. His attempts at drama, awkward at best. I would like to think that part of the problem was the script, it's just awful. But better actors have done more with less. Nicholas Cage can turn crap into gold. Hemsworth just looks confused and unsure of himself. He may become a great actor, but I think he'll have to find a direction other than drama. People may defend this film, although I don't know how. I think the biggest flaw was they tried to take a harrowing tale and turn it into a popcorn adventure story. It just doesn't work. When I think of other true stories done far, far better I think of Alive, the 1993 film of a plane crash in the Andes - a gripping tale that gets over the action filled plane crash and focuses on the survivors actions until their rescue. Even Blind Spot. Hitler's Secretary, a documentary where an old woman talks for an hour and a half in a monotone in German was far more gripping than In the Heart of the Sea. Thinking about this, I now think I understand the greatest problem with Howard's film. It tries so hard to give itself some sense of importance by dwelling too much on it's connection with Melville's masterpiece. It forces the whaling aspect of the film while completely missing out on what whaling was all about. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that no one connected with this film had actually read Moby Dick. If they did, they would realize how much of the book is on whaling and why. I'm sure Howard just looked and thought ""Moby Dick is a story about whaling so we have to have whaling stuff."" He completely misses that Moby Dick is a story about revenge and madness but the Essex is a story about survival. So instead of the survival we get this forced connection with Moby Dick. It's dull, rambling and pointless. Skip this movie."
" Solid story about economic heroes.
",0.5994,0.7745,2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"A prequel to a work of fiction. The conflict between the captain and first mate, mentioned near the beginning of the movie is not borne out by the rest of the movie. In fact, all the characters are secondary to the whale whose presence dominates the story. It's all about the whale that refuses to die and trashes an entire ship. The movie does a good job in depicting the challenges associated with whaling and why it was such an important industry. Chris Hemsworth offers an excellent portrayal of the first mate, Chase, who is at odds with the captain, Pollard, who got the job through nepotism. The movie tries to play up the class differences separating the two men, but the captain isn't arrogant enough nor the first mate resentful enough to generate any intense drama. Whether all the crew will survive is another question, and it is that aspect of the story that gives the movie its dramatic power. These men risked their lives to fuel the country and were the heroes of their time. The movie shows that and for that reason is worth watching."
" We saw the sea..
",0.0,0.9616,2017-09-24 00:00:00,9,"Epic. Grand. These are just some of the words you can use to describe this film. I went into this literally knowing nothing other than it has that guy who plays thor in it and there is a boat. And water. Lots of water. An as I recall the marketing didn't give anything away but this film didn't do so well at the box office when it came out because it was one of the movies North Korea leaked that year. But yeah, telling you what it is about will spoil the experience a little because the subject matter is well-known but I will say this: the film is a realistic take on a classic. If you're into great ocean epics, you're going to love this."
" Best ""Giant Whale"" Movie
",0.6369,0.8271,2017-08-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie was pretty darn good. I thought that it was a little sad when the people harpooned the mama whale who was trying to get away to protect its baby, but then again, its life so that happens. I was excited when the giant whale came in to save the day but then just wished it would go away when it kept bothering the already ship-wrecked people. It was very disturbing when they had to eat a person, and then pulled sticks to see who would be killed and eaten next. Over all this movie was a 9/10 I would recommend this to anyone who likes a roller-coaster of a movie and a great story!"
" Song of the Sea.
",0.0,0.9781,2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"After watching the marvellous 1976 film Bartleby,I started looking for other Herman Melville-related projects. Trying to sail in a different direction to the famous productions of Moby Dick,I was intrigued to find a flick about the inspiration behind Melville's book,which led to me meeting the real Captain Ahab.The plot-1850:Wanting to build on the outline for his next set-at sea novel, author Herman Melville tracks down Thomas Nickerson,a former cabin boy who is the only living survivor of the sinking of the Essex. Pushed with money by Melville,Nickerson begins telling his tale.1820:Cashing in on the whale oil gold rush, whaling company includes some quick additions to the Essex so it can go whale hunting. Hiring Nickerson as a cabin boy,the company get Owen Chase as First Mate and George Pollard as Captain. Going deep into the Offshore Grounds,the crew try to catch a white whale,but fail to,and are left with a broken ship. Stranded in the middle of the sea,the crew enter the heart of darkness of the ocean.View on the film:Racing down from the race tracks of Rush with the same lead actor and cameraman,director Ron Howard & cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle ride the wave of ""Golden Age"" Hollywood epics, where sweeping crane shots over the beautiful Canary Islands and very well done earthy CGI make the ocean go as far across the screen as the eye can see.Harpooning the crew into the depths of the sea,Howard washes the bright blockbuster blue away for over saturated burning yellows and blood reds dehydrating any memory of adventure from the crew.Altering the fascinating real story behind Nickerson's autobiography (he wrote it in 1876,and it remained lost until 1960!) the screenplay by Charles Leavitt/ Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver brings to shore the friction Chase and Pollard over who should be the captain,whilst the crew keep their eyes on the task at hand. Carving out the boys own Adventure into incredibly dark themes that include suicide,the writers give the months lost at sea a real weight,where the dialogue,and the life drain out of the survivors.Reuniting with Howard, Chris Hemsworth gives Chase a salty gravitas,which Hemsworth uses as a uniting glue among the others. Following orders from Benjamin Walker's slick Pollard, Tom Holland wonderfully grinds down the wide-eyed innocence of young Nickerson,as he enters the belly of the beast."
" In the Heart of the Sea but NOT Moby Dick
",0.5504,0.7094,2017-06-04 00:00:00,7,"It seems there is a misleading here. This movie is not based on the classic book of Moby Dick, but on the book that was published in 2001, called ""In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex"". I really enjoyed the movie, but it has nothing to do with the story of Moby Dick. It is a bit of a fraud to be honest. Someone just published a similar story like Moby Dick with another name and of course not the same context (Moby Dick is superior and one of the best books ever) so that they could present us a movie with happy end, likable characters etc. For me, this dishonor the writer of Moby Dick, Herman Melville. The movie moved me and I really enjoyed this story, I loved how nature is depicted and that for once again humans are greedy creatures that do not respect other beings. But that does not change the fact that director wanted an easy movie, and not one that would be based in the ruthless reality about sea, nature and man.﻿"
" It sails and then it sinks
",0.0,0.7853,2017-05-23 00:00:00,5,"In scene one, Herman Melville meets a whaler who tells a tale worthy of the ages. His ship was smashed in by a 100 foot white sperm whale, and the survivors were adrift at sea for weeks until they had no food left ....except each other.This medium budget sea epic from Ron Howard is not a bad movie, but it isn't any good either. In the first hour, it succeeds in building some momentum as we set out to sea with Chris Hemsworth and we sail right into a storm. To Howard's credit, he has a very distinctive way of shooting these scenes that is both immersive and allows the CGI to blend in. The picture looks as if we are seeing it through a spy glass, with drops of spray in the lens creating a surreal like soft focus. Some of this technique was visible in his previous film Rush but was less effective and resulted in a blurry picture.Hemsworth succeeds in commanding the screen with his bravado and virtuousness for a good while. Unlike in Rush, his character comes from a place of melancholy rather than ego. He is the smartest sailor on a ship that is under the command of a rookie and inexperienced captain, appointed at the request of the Whaling company. As is typical of Hollywood movies, the individuals representing commerce and industry are one dimensional and vilified. This development is as annoying as it is unnecessary.The movie has dozens of computer generated whales, which are competently rendered but animated to swim at hyper realistic, unconvincing speeds. The star of the sea is the great white whale who wreaks havoc on our small band of sailors. From this point on the movie sinks with the ship.The last act is dreary, emotional detached, and strangely paced. Potetially compelling scenes feel as if they were cut short in order to make a two hour running length. Hemsworth and his mates drift along in their whaleboats while their beards grow between the cuts, and the giant whale pops up a few more times to attack. One problem is that this Moby Dick doesn't have enough sense of menace; he never shows his teeth (both literally and figuratively). Melville's Moby Dick was a beast, this whale is just an animal.As a tale of survival, In the Heart of the Sea feels lacking because it feels rushed. The material may have been better suited to a three part mini-series, a format that would give the characters more room to breath. In a good survival tale, the characters come away finding their humanity or something meaningful, none of that is visible here. Instead, the punchline of the film is that this story was the inspiration for one of the greatest pieces of American prose. That in itself does carry some meaning, but not enough to make the film worth watching."
" Out of its time.
",0.0,-0.3291,2017-05-10 00:00:00,7,Ron Howard has made many wonderful movies but this is not really one of his best. Who had the idea that the cinema-going public would want to see whales being slaughtered for the oil they could supply in a barbarous way? Of course another drawback is the use of CGI which is almost always obvious. The onboard scenes are brilliantly done but at hardly any point does the viewer have any connection to the captain and crew of The Essex. Yes the film is kind of cold and uninvolving which is unusual in a film directed by Ron Howard. One thing the film does point up is the dreadful life the whalers of the time had. Out at sea for months and sometimes years at a time. Poorly fed and badly treated and always in danger of losing their lives in pursuit of a living.
" In the Heart of the Sea Review
",0.0,0.9761,2017-03-26 00:00:00,6,"In the Heart of the Sea had the potential to be one of the best if not the best movie of the year. I don't know what happened, but it seemed like Little Ronny Howard tried to do new things with his direction. Allow me to explain.Synopsis: In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down. Starring: Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy, Benjamin Walker Director: Ron HowardThe three men I posted on the starring line were the three stars of the movie, but there was quite a bit more talent involved in the movie. Enough to the point that should have made the movie great. That's not to say the acting was bad, it wasn't.The thing that made the movie a mild disappointment was the way Ronny directed the movie. For a movie that took place at sea, there was the chance of showing some epic wide shots of the action on the ship. Instead, we got some extreme close-ups that took away from the action.Then there was the CGI of the sea creatures. Someone should have known better to do what they did. The CGI just did not look good at all. There were parts where even the sea looked fake.In truth, I did not know that Moby Dick was based on a somewhat true story. So, telling this story in flashback form was the right choice. And, besides the actors involved, it was the best part of the movie. The tale of survival is a story that will live on forever.Final Thoughts: Needless to say, I was more than a little disappointed in this movie. It could have been a lot better, but we got what we got.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks. If you would like to continue to follow my post, go ahead and like this page.

" Intense Tale of Survival
",0.0772,0.3612,2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"I am a huge fan of Moby Dick. I've taught it as a novel; I've read it several times. Its artistry is beyond measure. Herman Melville certainly knew his stuff when it came to whaling and the sea. Apparently, Melville gained his inspiration from a particular whaling voyage that produced fodder for his imagination. This film takes the fictional Melville back to the time where he heard the story of the white whale. If one looks at the book as the allegory it is, we put the stamp of whiteness and all the implications of the color (or lack of it) that it implies. This movie takes any artistry out of the story. Ahab lost his leg and pursues the elusive cetacean in the ultimate act of revenge. Here, a bunch of guys get in over their heads. They had an overzealous captain who simply was out for the commercial value of the animal. When the whale destroys the ship (they do give him supernatural powers) part of the crew is in whaleboats, trying to get someplace safe. Terrible things happen, including cannablism, and some manage to hold off their fates till they are rescued. But there is something dull about the pacing of the story. We aren't made privy to much of what goes on among them. There are the obligatory sacrifices that are not new to this genre. It's a decent movie, but a better script and some more personal depth would have helped."

" Nature versus Human in the 19th century
",0.0,-0.4271,2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"Based on the true story of the Essex, this movie depicts the physical and mental conditions of the crew very well with magnificent visual effects that are not exaggerated and realistic. The first half of the movie shows the conflict between Chase and Pollard when Pollard, who is not experienced in the whaling business but is from a prestigious family, becomes the captain of the ship instead of Chase, whose dream was to become a captain. Chase actually was promised to get the position this time, but was put off due to his status in the society. This illustrates the social inequality at that time.The second half of the movie becomes much more intense and turns on to the human instinct of survival. Although the action that was shown in the trailer was very brief, the stillness and the emptiness of the sea after the destruction of the ship is emphasized more through the contrast between the scenes. Everything becomes much more depressing and tiring and the image made me feel as if I was also lost in the sea. The fear and the despair of the lost crew is well portrayed through the great acting and the plot doesn't lose focus until the end of the movie. Some scenes of the movie, although realistic, were quite shocking, and the scenes when Chase looked into the whale's eye and didn't kill it, and when someone said that oil was found in the ground lingered in my mind for a while."
