" Birdman is a Majestic Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9498,2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is an amazing film that balances amazing visual effects with a philosophical story line that makes the viewer think. Birdman explores a few different themes.
One theme of Birdman is the understanding of where a person belongs in the world, for Riggan Thomson (played by Michael Keaton) he is trying to show the world that he is an artist that can be taken seriously on Broadway plays and try to break the mold of the action hero Birdman he played 20 years ago, and break the Hollywood stereotype that society has placed on him.
Birdman is about a man named Riggan Thomson who used to play a popular superhero in the early 1990s who is trying to put on a play on Broadway in New York City and wants to be viewed as a serious artists who has depth, not just a Hollywood machine in a latex Bird outfit.
There are internal and external conflicts Riggan is dealing with. There is an inner self doubt that lives in Riggan Thomson, he hears voices in his head of Birdman telling him he should of just stayed in Hollywood and make a reboot of Birdman and have a reality tv show. The voice tells hime h3e is going to fail and is not cut out for Broadway.
External conflicts Riggan was facing was in the form of a smug play critic who tells Riggan he is a Hollywood hack who is trying to pretend he is a real artist, he has no business on Broadway and she is going to write the play a horrible review.
Editing in Birdman is done superbly, In the opening scene there is a flash image of a jelly fish washed up on the beach then it cuts to Michael Keaton levitating sitting Indian style in his small dressing room looking out his window with Birdman's voice asking ""How did we end up in this dump?""
It is later revealed that Riggan once tried to drown himself in the ocean but, was attacked by a bunch of jelly fish that caused him to run back to the shore to seek medical attention. The way Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu tied the image of jelly fish is brilliant.
Choosing Michael Keaton to play Riggan Thomson is a clever step that just adds more depth to the movie. Keaton having been cast as Batman in the early 1990s is perfect for the role of a washed up superhero who is trying to show the world he still has something to offer."

The acting was brilliant, the cinematography too.
It was kind of hard to understand the message and I'm trying to be smart now. It is very hard to understand something absurd because there is no correct interpretation. I'll watch it again someday, I hope I'll get it."

",0.7249,0.9876,2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"First time I've watched this movie, it was alright, but second time it was a masterpiece.
1.The casting is perfect , Michael Keaton was amazing, he deserve the Oscars best actor in a leading role, but sadly he didn't won, Edward Norton was good, Emma Stone was amazing too.
2.When you see this movie, you feel it's all in one camera, one shot, one scene.
Last thing, this is one one of the best movies ever made."

",0.8922,-0.8474,2021-02-22 00:00:00,10,"This is definitely in my top 100 favourite movies of all time, probably in the 50s - 70s range.
If you don't like it, wait a year and watch it again. If, after multiple viewings you still don't like it; I mean are you human?
*spoilers from here on*
Note on the ending: a lot of people dislike it because of how uncertain it is; does Riggan have powers or not? Here is my take: Riggan still imagines his supernatural abilities, and although he sees the birds fly away when he's in the hospital, I think that him flying is showing that although he has reinvented himself, he still has not changed as a person. The unstable man who falls asleep on the street drunk is no different to the confident man lying in his hospital bed."
" The True Meaning Of Virtue
",0.6808,0.9844,2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,"Birdman devilers to the viewer a unique experience. it shows properly right the compass of caring too much about other people's opinions, and not caring at all!
I've also notice the inspiration for we to persue our dreams , not for the sake of our reputation or honor. but for our own self-esteem and life realization.
Outstanding performance by Michael Keaton and Edward Norton. Credits also for Emma Stone and the great cinematography.
In Fact , A masterpiece."

Pretentious in every possible way, over-acted, pointless, non-sensical, another waste of time."
" Birdman Never Truly Flies
",-0.3412,0.9613,2021-01-30 00:00:00,3,"While the movie begins with a promising premise of a glory-hungry actor looking for his way back to relevance without taking on his long-abandoned birdsuit, it never commits itself to the meaningful message it sets up. Most of the film's characters are shallow and lack a discernable motivation (besides the protagonist), and the unnecessary sexual scenes and profanity do nothing but get in the way of this movie's already-misguided plot.Despite these outstanding negatives, Keaton, Norton, and Stone each deliver excellent performances, and the single-shot filmography is impressive."
" ""People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical bull...""
",0.8906,0.99,2021-01-20 00:00:00,9,"When I left the theater, I was quite confused and did not know what to think about this movie. It was visually mesmerizing, but at times boring, original in a strange way that left a strong impression, but I wasn't sure if that impression was positive or negative ... A the time, I haven't even heard of Iñárritu. Years later, after watching all his films, this one came up again and, familiar with Iñárritu's style, I had a much more powerful experience.The film does not rely so much on the story, which has already been seen many times and is not particularly elaborated, as on the impressive study of characters and at the same time the dramatic and black-humored satire of the entertainment industry. The cast is strong and everyone got enough space to show off in full glory. It is interesting that all the characters are somewhat parodies of the actors who interpret them as well as their previous roles. And perhaps the strongest trump of the film are the extremely long shots that try to leave the impression that the entire film was made in one take.9/10"
" I. Loved. This. Movie!
",0.636,0.9884,2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,"When I saw this in a theatre with a friend, after it ended I felt the urge to jump out of my seat and give it a standing ovation. But most people just sat there, kind of going, ""Huh. That was interesting"". Still, I absolutely loved it. Michael Keaton gave a brilliant performance, as did Emma Stone and the rest of the cast.The one ""long take"" aspect is well done, although kind of obvious in places. But the storyline of a person trying to accomplish something that truly means something is something I hope we can all relate to. This is one of the few films I've ever purchased. Easily one of my favorite movies ever."

",-0.6249,-0.5965,2021-01-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie was so bad, that it's the reason why I registered to IMDB.
I've expected a lot from this movie based on the IMDB score.
I wanted to quit watching it after 15 minutes. It was so boring.
But I kept telling myself: something must happen soon. It has such a good score. Something must happen soon.
But it didn't. It was boring all to the end.
Pleas skip this movie. This is my recommendation."

Especially interesting was his internal struggle with his past that does not seem to let go. Norton brings another strong performance (together with the rest of the cast) of a renowned movie star that cant seem to get it together in his personal life, but on stage like in real life he is brilliant. I was really surprised that some people undervalued this great and bold film thinking that its peer ""Boyhood"" is the better movie..
If you want to watch a truly fun movie give this a shot."

The movie fluently combined the motivations of characters into the scenes, especially under the urban (crowded) background of NYC. The chaotic relationships ultimately formed aesthetic balance as the protagonist received the freedom he sought for. Not a flawless performance, but definitely worth the Oscar."

" master piece
",0.0,0.9549,2020-12-17 00:00:00,7,"When I'm watching this film I was shocked and at the same time amazed by the cinematography, it was next level. Though it was made to look like a single shot film and it was not, but the preparation that they have been through for achieving such lengthy shots was very difficult, and also a unique attempt by director Alejandro G Inarritu(also the director of DiCaprio's ""REVENANT"") wins an Oscar for original screenplay and also for best direction for this film. The performance of Michael Keaton was very inspiring and every aspiring actor must look up to."
" The best choice for academy award...FIANALLY
",0.6369,0.6276,2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"I was strolling down and reading some of the users' reviews when I faced some really negative ones and as I read their ideas, I wasn't convinced to lower my rating at all. I think some of the movie goers here are only capable of viewing a movie at face value.
First of all, let's be clear about the ONE SHOT thing. To my mind, it wasn't boring at all! It was something new that I had never experienced before and I think that's one of the reasons this spectacular picture stands out forever.
And about the cast, some were of the opinion that there was too much acting of them and most of their performances were overacted. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I don't get how an furious girl shouting at his dad about their issues could be considered as OVERACTED! Or an anxious director going wild over a theatre critic again known as OVERACTED?!
Regarding music, not being as exciting as a Hans Zimmer masterpiece, it had its specialty as seldom can it be found in other movies. That's what we are looking for! Something new.
To conclude, sensational and artistic certainly it was, I don't recommend it if you are a fan of all action, fast-paced movies. Here we need patient movie goers who give a thought about greatness of a picture."
" One of the Best Films Ever Made.
",0.6369,0.9991,2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"I have been an avid film lover all my life, for as long as I can remember, film has been a place of comfort to me, a place to laugh and distract myself, as well as focus on my sorrows and breathe into the life of another world. Birdman is a very important film to me. Not only do I feel it shines the light on mental illness, show business, fame, as well as so many other important topics- but it tells it so honestly, so genuinely, and without taking any stops or shortcuts along the way. I think the film is a masterpiece, in every way imaginable. I didn't expect much from the film when I first saw it, I heard good things about it, but also some mixed reactions, so I tried to keep an open mind throughout. I was blown away when first watching it, and since then, I've watched it nearly a dozen times. Michael Keaton was truly robbed for not winning the Best Actor Oscar in 2014, and I truly believe it is his best performance to date, which is saying a lot because I love him as an actor. Emma Stone is also incredible on screen, also my favorite performance from her. I love La La Land as well as her performance in it, but c'mon, she is so much better here than she ever was in any other film. The supporting cast is great, I especially appreciated Ed Norton, Lindsay Duncan, and Naomi Watts- each providing very memorable performances among a cast of incredibly talented people. Norton gets more time to shine, but I think Duncan provides one of the most important roles, and truly no one could have done it better than her. The cinematography is fantastic, in fact it's my favorite of any film period. The script is brilliant, the direction even better, and the pacing is taut and absolutely perfect. There isn't a single dull moment in Birdman, nor is there anything bad about it. It's a truly divine piece of cinema, and i'm not ashamed to call it one of the best films ever made.
My Rating: 10/10"
" Satire at its peak
",0.0,0.9098,2020-11-30 00:00:00,8,I like how this movie realistically potrays the struggle of an artist in a time where people value big budget superhero films with cheesy lines and average perfomances over true art in a satirical fashion. It is perfect in almost all aspects right from the beginning till the end and Michael Keaton's performance is just terrific!
" This is a magnificent film
",0.5994,0.9423,2020-11-26 00:00:00,9,This film was way better than i was expecting it to be. Great acting from great actors and the director is amazing.
" Disappointment
",-0.5106,0.34,2020-11-24 00:00:00,5,Pretentious and childish. Pseudorealistic pseudoart made so that pseudointellectual 14 years old girls could call it deep and feel sophisticated.
" Not me saying it makes fun of superhero movies.
",0.5106,0.9923,2020-11-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie is so good, although it may seem that the movie is a one take shot there is cut where you don't see which i give them kudos for that.I mean it's a movie about a washed up superhero, starring Keaton. Ironic right!? He is not washed up but i still thought that detail was funny. Also from the beginning there is a couple Avengers references, which age very well for a movie from 2014. And it's also funny because Ed Norton is an ex Avenger. You will also pick up a bit of Venom characteristics in there.I personally loved the shots from the movie, a bit shaky, but they fit, also the one color shots that often appear are so good.Acting is very good considering this was shot during a very short period of time and also considering that other actors were doing other projects like Emma Stone, which she was recording The Amazing Spider Man.I will say that you should definitely watch this much, because it creates a fine line between superhero, and current broadway."
" It really is as bad as the bad reviews say.
",-0.819,0.8597,2020-11-19 00:00:00,1,The unbelievably good ratings for this film are exactly that.. unbelievable. Do not waste your time watching this movie especially if you have some knitting needles handy to poke in your eyes. The latter will be far more enjoyable.
" Very Psychological
",0.0,0.9923,2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,"I guess not all films that win academy awards are boring and pointless, which probably says a lot about what I actually think of the Academy Awards. However, I have decided to give some of these films a go, even if it is to see what they are really like and if they are really worth watching. The other thing is that this film stars Michael Keaton, an actor I remember playing in multiple films when I was a kid, but just seemed to suddenly disappear off the radar until recently.One interesting thing to note is how there seems to be some similarities in the more recent roles that he has played. He was Vulture in the first of Marvel's Spiderman movies, and in this one, well, he plays a character whose only claim to fame is that we was Birdman in an older series of films and is now struggling for a semblance of relevance, which I found rather coincidental.I guess that is the main theme that this film revolves around, and that is the idea of relevance and staying relevant. The character, Riggan Thomas, is attempting to produce a play by Raymond Carver called 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love' and it seems that the main thing about the character in this play is the desire to be relevant. In fact, the final speech in the play, where is comes to realise that he is no longer relevant, is repeated numerous times. In a way it seems that this is something that Thomas is attempting to come to grips with, and yet the ending of the play suggests that there is only one route out of this quandary.Of course, being a Hollywood actor, and one that has played a superhero as well, sort of puts him at odds with the New York Theatre critic circle. The suggestion is that while one can go from stage to screen, the opposite is not necessarily true. In fact, one of the critics suggests that this movement is a form of abomination, as if the trash from the west coast are coming over to New York to despoil the purity of what they consider to be their culture (though one could argue that this is somewhat correct, considering that theatre performances tend to have more class than do the movies from the West Coast - or maybe it is just another way that highlights of how vast, and differing, American Culture actually is).This is a psychological film as well, in that we seem to be inhabiting Thomas' head. Throughout the film we see him perform acts that seem to only belong to superheroes, such as telekinesis, and even in some parts where he is flying. It is as if the character of Birdman has literally taken over his subconscious and it is something that he simply cannot break away from. This in a sense can be particularly true, especially since one of the actors, Mike Shiner, seems regularly point out that he needs the scene to be as realistic as possible for him to perform at his best (something that seems to get him into no end of trouble).Look, in the end, this is one of those films that there is so much in it that simply can not be explored in a simple review. It is complex, and raises lots of questions, particularly with the final scene, which sort of leaves one wondering what has actually happened. In a way this is sort of something that is to be expected from films like this, and it is definitely one that needs to be watched again, and much more closely. In a way, there are suggestions that what may seem to be at first an embarrassment is actually a benefit is certainly something to ponder, yet there is also the idea that some actors can get so caught up in their characters that it is impossible to actually break away from them. In fact, a couple of them do come to mind.This is definitely a film to watch, and probably watch multiple times, and it is also one that is probably deserving of not just a blog post, exploring all of the intricacies that exist within, but could probably also warrant a thesis all of its own."
" A visual feast, too bad about the cliched non-story.
",-0.5423,-0.7336,2020-11-14 00:00:00,3,"First of all, be warned, this is not a comedy. I don't have a clue why it says 'comedy' in the description. While there are a few quasi funny moments, it's an angst-filled art-movie, one of those that thinks depression and melancholy and mental illness and self-destruction are the epitome of cool.On the up, the cinematography is excellent and the quasi-one shot technique a technical marvel, even as it makes the viewer feel rather claustrophobic. The movie also features a great cast with some excellent performances. That's worth three stars. Just too bad none of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting, one major reason why it's difficult to get into the movie. If you don't care about the characters, why watch?This is one of the reasons for the movie's worst failing, which is that it is rather boring. My wife fell asleep halfway through, and I found myself looking at my watch several times during the last hour, wishing it was over. Most of the time there's not much happening, as the film-maker presents endless scenes that presumably are supposed to be deep and meaningful, yet that are vacuous and seem to go on forever. The insertion of several OTT scenes that are supposed to be funny also felt forced, particularly as the ending turns out to be pretty nihilistic.I've watched tons of European art movies in late 70s and 80s, and many of them thought that presenting life as difficult and depressing and meaningless was cool and held some kind of deep message. Eventually I realised that it was just another fad, with no more meaning than Back To The Future. There are a few movies with genuine deep and transcendent messages. Birdman isn't one of them. It's simply a rather boring 2014 riff on a familiar and cliched seventies European art-movie theme."

The movie is good and I could even say that it is quite good and entertaining.
He is entertaining for his well-written lines and incredible performances by the entire cast.
Perhaps the best thing is their photography because the film seems to have been shot in one shot but at the same time I think that limits them from doing other things with the good script it has.
The bad thing is that the secondary stories that the film presents do not finish concluding at the end of the film, the only story that concludes is that of the protagonist. And the other thing that struck me as bad is that it never made me laugh.
Another good thing about the film is the internal conflict of the protagonist who wants to prove to be a great actor. When he accepts himself as what he is, things start to turn out well for him.
The film criticizes critics for underestimating certain actors, films, or plays.
And finally I think Edward Norton acts better in this movie than Michael Keaton and I don't understand why Michael Keaton shot himself.
It's good but in my opinion it's overrated."
" Innarritu is masterful as the director and Keaton is on top once again
",0.2023,0.9702,2020-10-22 00:00:00,10,"Alejandro Inarritu directed and won 3 Oscars all together along with his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who won an Oscar for his amazing artistic achievement in making the movie look like it was being filmed in all one shot.
Inarritu is a groundbreaking director who also co-wrote the screenplay and led an all star cast starring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone who were all nominated for Oscars as well.
Keaton is magnificent as an aging comic book movie star and he brings his full background to this role. He could have easily won an Oscar but this movie either way was his comeback film. Everyone shines in this one. Innarritu made a masterpiece with this one but I am sure there are many more to come."

I loved the nauseous atmosphere coming from the lineair timeline, camerawork, score and acting performances but in the end it doesn't bring anything home other than great quality of production of a story. It's nervously tense and a bit noir gritty especially towards the end, it looks great, it rolls reasonable fast. But it's like reading a book that some uninspired person talked you into and the book is just a story about characters having all kinds of drama together, The end. I think I had a similar feeling after 21 grams and Babel. It tries so hard to be a perfect execution of a dramatic story, that the storytelling becomes the most important part, bigger than the story itself. I get annoyed by those kind of films. I mean, you either make a movie out of love for a great story or you experiment and an artistic expression starts telling a story, all acceptable. This here though is like writing a magic trick. The story is just there to male the writing 'work'. Like cards are necessary to build a house of cards. It's close to being a narcissist exhibition of excellence and has no respect for it's subjects, just for it's creators. But then again, it's only a movie, and it was fun to watch."
" A GREAT film that stands out from the rest!
",0.729,0.9987,2020-09-12 00:00:00,8,"I was never very interested in cinema in the last decade. It may be out of arrogance on my part, but I always heard it said that the most acclaimed films of that decade (mostly Oscar winners) were very overrated. So I was procastinating to watch this movie, and I only watched it because the two movies I tried to watch before my internet didn't catch. (Yojimbo and Full Metal Jacket).But, I really liked this one. The writing is great, the performances are great, the direction is great, the movie rhythm is great and the film is great. It is absolutely entertaining at all times, the dialogues are fun and can be dramatic, ironically funny, cynical and it never seems that the film is playing meaningless scenes to increase the duration.The history of the film is appreciative, Michael Keaton makes a remarkable protagonist with a good alter ego and an interesting character arc. Emma Stone and Edward Norton are fine too. They give themselves to the character and make good performances. The other characters may not have as much focus, development or attention from the film as they do, but they appear at the right time and complement the Unexpected Virtue of IgnoranceThe end of the film is a full plate for true cinema fans. After making his crazy decision, he gets what he wants in his work but he doesn't get rid of his biggest problem. The result then is something genius, interpretive, well fitted, which can be sad, happy, false or whatever you want. Alejandro did not want his film to have a normal ending, like the rest of the film, the ending is certainly splendid. What to people may seem pretentious, slow and meaningless, to people who really understand is one of the best endings of all time.In the end, Birdman is a real rare gem in today's cinema. Even if the situation of the cinema is so artistically poor, excellent films like Birdman are rare. I didn't think the movie was overrated, I thought it was amazing. It's one of those movies that makes you like movies. Highly recommended for everyone, it is a sensational experience."

" One of the Best Films Shot in the 2010s
",0.6369,0.9985,2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,"Birdman is definitely one of the best movies shot in the XXI century so far. The film is somewhat innovative in its form but rather old-fashioned in the manner of the story itself. Both facts cannot make this movie good or bad. I just state.
Form-wise, the first thing I must mention is that Birdman like it was made in one shot (and if I'm not mistaken, most of the film was really made this way). The camera follows the characters and leaves them after a while, roaming from place to place switching from one person to another. It's big fun to watch this but what makes this style especially wonderful is that prior to Birdman Alejandro G. Iñárritu, a director, was famous for his movies with stories sliced in pieces with numerous intentional chronology violations. The Birdman style of narration is a grotesque way to say ""goodbye"" to the signature Iñárritu's manner of storytelling. Another interesting detail about the movie's outer side is the soundtrack. Most of the time, there is no music in an ordinary sense (although there are moments when the music plays because it is played by the film characters). But it's not the same as the Dogme 95 manifesto that prohibits soundtracks per se! Instead of usual melodies or songs, Birdman incorporates a jazzy drum improvisation excellently performed by Antonio Sánchez. This drumming is tense, emotional, and it keeps up with the feelings that the movie characters go through on the screen. That's fantastic!
Speaking of the story itself, I should say that it reminds me of something that I already knew. It's about family (like most of the American films including even such strange examples as Commando with Arnold Schwarzenegger). The main character is a man with a bright past as a popular blockbuster actor (ironically the role is played by ex-Batman star Michael Keaton) dealing with faded glory and a bunch of professional and personal struggles. He was (and he is) harmful to women in his life, even though he tries to act the right way. His professional ambitions conflict with his family duties but foremost his personal qualities make him what he is - a grown loser trying to get a better life and playing double or nothing putting both himself and his remaining friends at risk. We could see something similar in Aronofsky's Wrestler but that film is way different. Its tone, its accents, and the pallet are not the same as in Birdman (but not less worthy, after all).
Birdman is different because it has much humor to it. Black humor, to be more accurate. The fact that the story happens amidst the preparation of the Broadway show, makes it a little bit more old-fashioned. There are eccentric characters that are not psychopaths but dreamers in Birdman - that's something we miss in the modern-day movies, I think. Another nice trait is that this movie is full of amazing whit and natural dialogues, many of which were not created just to pull the plot further - that's another thing that is rarely brought in by modern movie-makers.
Probably, that's only my nostalgia (because Birdman reminds me of the best films of the XX century), I don't know, but I really like Birdman. This movie got me from the first minutes and I wished it would never end when I was watching it for the first time in the theatre. Thanks, Alejandro! Amazing cast, amazing plot, amazing performance, and form! Great roles of Keaton, Andrea Riseborough (!!), and Edwards Norton. It was a rare case when Oscar went to the people who deserved it."
" A screwed-up bunch
",0.0,0.4053,2020-08-23 00:00:00,6,"Hi-diddle-dee-dee, an actor's life for me..."" We suspected show business people were basically a screwed-up bunch, seeking validation from audience adulation, yearning to be taken ""seriously"" despite success after success, trying to find ""love"" from person after person. But after seeing this film, who would ever want to become a Broadway performer? We see the delusional world of Riggan Thomson, a former movie super hero megastar known as Birdman, now trying to gain self-respect by producing and starring in a ""serious"" Broadway play. A technique used by the director is extreme close-ups of the unretouched face of each cast member, revealing blemishes and wrinkles. This is contrasted with the made-up faces they put on for the stage, especially Riggan who wears a tight-fitting hair-piece and fake facial hair for his character. Accidentally locked out of the theater prior to his big closing scene he is forced to walk, wearing only his underwear, through Times Square to the theater's front door. Such scenes are apparently not unusual in New York as no one seems bothered until they realize who he is - not the actor appearing in a thought-provoking stage drama but Birdman in the flesh. These fans want to get his autograph and have photos taken with him as he struggles to return to his new world. Ultimately, he cannot find a place in this world and mentally and emotionally retreats to a fantasyland where he is no longer Birdman but free to fly without the burdens that have plagued him for so long."
" Didn't get it!
",0.0,0.9944,2020-08-18 00:00:00,7,"So let me get this straight, another film whose director is ""over-arting"" to make every single shot as perfect as possible and keeping you confused between what is real and what is not, then telling you it's hallucinations then again with a simple reaction telling you it is not! Seriously I hate when directors and writers try to make an ambiguous film as hard as hard as they can cause what you don't get is for sure a smart one, right?! I can't deny how it's cinematography style is perfect and captivating along with the amazing performances by everybody (except Emma Stone who I don't really know whether she was nominated for being good or cause the year 2014 lacked good performances in this category being the least person with time on screen and also with emotions!) but that is just not good enough to save it's way of trying to be so much a film that you set as an example for movie making for those who want to learn, and don't get me wrong this style is not bad but it cannot be left with interpretation for what's happening at some points which I guess Christopher Nolan is the best director ever to do it with clearing the difficult things up at proper times of the movie and not leaving you with scenes that are like difficult verses of poems that not all people will get it. Some people loved it, others didn't but this time I am on the latter side with no reason for the ones who loved but they only like what they don't understand but still amazed by it's style of making but I give it a 7.5/10 ."

Birdman is a masterpiece, an insight into the mind of a person. It perfectly shows the conflicts inside the mind of it's protagonist, Riggan Thompson. Through Birdman we see the difficult life of Riggan as he tries to achieve success, fails, tries again. His goal throughout the movie is to be recognised as an artist, to be someone more than a famous movie star, to be remembered as someone more than a guy in a bird costume. The restless days, the loaded nights, the constant struggle with people, their egos and the ego of yourself, a constant battle with his alter ego..."" Birdman"" himself, that believes he is better off as a guy in a suit., his days are brilliantly portrayed with the long takes.Life doesn't give rests then why should a movie on life should....life is nothing but the way you respond to the circumstances. Riggan strives hard and stops for no one. Hence, in the process becomes isolated from his loved ones. It's only after he is done with his play, has achieved all success that he realises that the most important thing that he craved was the hug, the hug of affection from his daughter, the embrace of his friends and his family. Even though the ending is weird and people have conflicting opinions, it's either optimistic or depressed. But i believe that it doesn't matter if he dies or if he flies.What matters is that he is loved, people care about him and he cares about them. He started out as a guy envying fame, a person with no friends only workmates and ends with him embracing love. He takes off the mask towards the end, a metaphor for taking off the birdman mask.
We all have that moment where we doubt ourselves. "" Is this the right thing for me""..."" Is what i am doing enough?"" ....Iñárritu through his world of magical realism gives us all hope and reminds us that most important thing is to do what you love, don't be a part of the horde and cherish the love you get.Birdman(2014) by Alejandro González Iñárritu"

" Man's desire for meaning and art
",0.4019,0.9907,2020-06-18 00:00:00,10,"I have always knew Alejandro González Iñárritu had it in him ever since Babel, and it goes to prove himself with seminar masterful works such as The Revenant and this masterpiece. The camerawork and cinematography is worked in a way that is to show the entire film was recorded in one take. This technical achievement is inspired straight out of the Hitchcockian technique in Rope (1948). Iñárritu has a good reason for using the one-take technique; the entire picture surrounds the protagonist and documents his every move and events transitioning one after another. In each those uninterrupted sequences we get to follow our protagonist layer after layer as a gradual continuous unraveling of his quest and yearning for art.The film is about man's desire for meaning and art. Our protagonist has before starred in a popular superhero character and his fame and career has only been popular because of that role. Now he wants to mature into a serious actor and take on a play on Broadway. But this proves a challenge because the superficiality of his past superhero role is the only thing that seems to excite his audience and make him relevant.One of the scenes that expresses the baggage he carries for his superhero role is when Tabitha the critic insulted him and says he does not cut out to be attempt at serious and mature and real art because of ""people like him"" who only a spectacle in pop culture, and that the fact that someone with a superficial background like that to take on Broadway is ludicrous to her.But finally the film gave a revelation to our protagonist when he did nail his Broadway role which gave astute recognition from his peers. Hence, the critic referred to him as ""the unexpected virtue of ignorance"", that someone who played a superhero role could unexpectedly pull off a grand performance in theater with nothing but realism. The third act of the film leaves a lot to be interpreted, but this is one of the few amazing philosophical and profound films that was fresh and original and did not need to be adapted from another material."

Furthermore, when the following/reframing shots sped up the soundtrack also did, sort of intertwining them both, this the gave Michael Keaton's character more emotion and frustration between him and his inner self because the fast soundtrack and following/reframing shots embodies his heartbeat and his impulsivity. This is another ingenious point of view, which heavily increased my enjoyment of this compelling film.

" 'Birdman' is not a masterpiece as cited by many, but it is an instigating, dynamic film, full of references and that makes us reflect in different ways
",0.3078,0.9953,2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Anyone who follows the career of Alejandro G. Iñárritu knows that the Mexican director deals with controversial topics, he is one of the few that invests mainly those marginalized and discriminated against by society. That was the case in Amores Brutos (2000), 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006). The Mexican director's films have several stories or 'arcs', where different nuclei of characters develop, whether or not they can cross, and this time he follows the same motto, but bringing innovation in the filming mode.In the past, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) was very successful playing Birdman, a superhero who has become a cultural icon. However, since he refused to star in the fourth film with the character, his career has started to decline. In search of lost fame and also recognition as an actor, he decides to direct, script and star in the adaptation of a consecrated text for Broadway. However, amid rehearsals with the cast of Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), Lesley (Naomi Watts) and Laura (Andrea Riseborough), Riggan must deal with his agent Brandon (Zach Galifianakis) and a strange voice that insists on remaining in your mind.Undoubtedly, 'Birdman' is the most daring work in Iñárritu's career so far. If in his previous films, most of them were worked on the editing island, true puzzles, the director's ability consists especially in innovating by filming practically everything in sequence, making the camera, sometimes faster, sometimes more calmly follow parallel plots that intertwine all the time, following not only the perspective of the protagonist Riggan Thomson, but also of all the other characters. At the same time, the viewer's gaze is guided by the director to follow the troubled relationship between the dreamy aspiring Brodway actress, Lesley with temperamental actor Mike Shiner and obviously Riggan with his lawyer, agent and best friend Brandon, with his ex-wife. , with the news of a possible pregnancy of one of the actresses in her play, with her daughter Sam (Emma Stone), besides having to deal with the problems behind the scenes of her new play and the fear of criticism, of that work that could be his triumphant return to the spotlight.The director makes a collage of references in the black humor drama ranging from Godard to Hitchcock and Sokurov. It has discreet influences from The American Night (1973) and The Player (1992). The montage, as in Festim Diabólico (1948) or Arca Russa (2002), engages long sequential shots with cuts at barely noticeable key moments, simulating a film that is totally unassembled. And this showing 99% of the time the tatro and its backstage, making the camera walk through the corridors, make-up rooms, costumes, etc., that is, in a dry space, which makes the question of filming in general more difficult, well in more open planes, sometimes in close-ups and sometimes in counter-plongée - when the camera is below eye level, facing upwards. The audience is not treated here only as external observers of your story, but as a character within the screen. Technically, 'Birdman' is a visual spectacle, but it depends a lot on the fusion of what is seen on the screen and the public's prior knowledge of its main actors, especially Michael Keaton, once the star of the time for having starred in two films of the Batman. This is essential for the operation of the film. Without metalanguage there would be no Birdman.Michael Keaton plays the role of his career here. The actor decides to play with his persona, building a believable man in a fantastic world. It was not enough for him to prove to everyone that he can still star in a successful production, his personal life is going from bad to worse. Riggan is explored carefully in layers - from the insecure director to the proud actor - bringing in the man who was once Bruce Wayne, three different personalities. The first of these is the man himself, an ordinary person who struggles to make his life work, trying to make his play work while he has to deal with his daughter, Sam (Emma Stone in her best performance so far), who, in turn, , has a certain involvement with drugs. The second stage is in the already mentioned performances within the performances and the genius is in the way this character dialogues with Riggan itself, reflecting, in the play, the life of the actor / director. The third, in turn, appears in the moments of loneliness of the character, Birdman appears as an aggressive manifestation of his self-respect, functioning as a hidden double-personality. Here Iñárritu inserts his touch of master, creating in us the doubt whether Birdman really exists or is it just a tired mind's imagination? Is Riggan really a superhero?If Keaton is featured, the same can be said of the supporting cast. Edward Norton gains a role to match his talent. Mike is a tough guy, who doesn't care about the opinions of others, and tries to steal the show every time he appears. His scenes with Emma Stone (equally great) and his clashes with Keaton are other memorable parts of the production. Highlight also for the always excellent Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough, who experience disappointments in the personal lives of their characters and end up supporting each other.Many other aspects are criticized by Iñarritu, who criticizes practically all aspects of the current film industry, such as the massive investment in superhero films, in the pride of the actors - perfectly exemplified by Edward Norton, who plays a cartoon version of himself - and, among many others, in film criticism itself. In the technical part we still have the soundtrack of Antonio Sanchez using only drums, which got more and more accelerated as the action unfolded and became more intensified on the scene. Emmanuel Lubezki's photography is fundamental to materialize Iñárritu's plans, working dynamically, changing the focus of attention on the characters at all times, also showing the dynamism behind the scenes of a theater and the pulsating life behind the curtains.'Birdman' deals with the protagonist's existential dilemma, about having fame and then losing it, about having to prove yourself with each new job, forcing yourself to reinvent yourself to feel relevant again. It is the eternal search for acceptance, here by the critics and the public. It is also a matter of learning to deal with your ego, especially in the artistic world. Keaton's character, who like the viewer, does not know what is true and what is theater (or cinema). Can he levitate? Can you make objects float? Is dead? These are some of the inventive and unusual actions that the actor will take throughout the story, in this mixture of fantasy and reality that the script proposes. A sensation that sometimes mixes reality and illusion, where the desired is manifested through Birdman's voice and figure, as if he were a ghost chasing his alter ego. They are one, inseparable, and the continuous appearance is nothing more than the voice of conscience questioning their actions, day after day. And, in addition, bringing an objective portrait of that world around him. 'Birdman' is not a masterpiece as cited by many, but it is an instigating, dynamic film, full of references and that makes us reflect in different ways, which is a little scarce in recent years."
" Must watch for Cinematography
",0.0,0.9459,2020-05-14 00:00:00,8,"The story of fading actor Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton)- who was once famous for his iconic role as the Birdman, takes on the straining task to mount a Broadway play.
As we see him struggle his way to the opening night, the journey of a movie star to truly become an actor while battling his ego and mending relationships becomes pellucid.The first thing that comes in my mind when I talk of this movie is its phenomenal piece of cinematography - a continuous shot feature.
Iñárritu makes sure that the characters make you question the moral, ethical and existential backdrop in which you live, all the while never taking away the glimmer of hope.
There is a constant feeling for validation and relevance and it cynically connects to the audience.With spectacular ensemble of cast and remarkable storytelling, this is definitely a noteworthy watch for everyone out there.The film truly resonates with (Edward Norton) Mike's dialogue:
""If art isn't making you feel something real, something uncomfortable, it's not inspiring.""
-
My Unpopular Opinion:
In its year, Birdman took home all the awards and I have seen people go gaga over it. However, there has been this uncanny thing that I could never point a finger on regarding why I could never ""love"" the movie until recently I read this review by Todd VanDerWerff.VanDerWerff talks about how the script being filled with exposition and I finally sighed, understanding that the characters have actually been explaining to each other their mental states rather than exploring them throughout the movie!And on a closer inspection, other than Sam's (Emma Stone) monologue about Riggan being self obsessed, none of the dialogues hold a substantial core."

But to me this film is totally aware of its own pretentiousness so I'm not really mad about it.It's about a Hollywood actor that needs validation as an artist. That's not a groundbreaking story but the narrative touches on valid subjects about the show business, the people around it and it's audience.The way it was shot is very cool, the acting is fantastic. I think that there were storylines that needed to wrap up. But as a whole is a good movie.I get why people might love or hate this film. I liked it."

" Captivating from start to finish!
",0.0,0.9983,2020-05-03 00:00:00,9,"Birdman tells the story of Riggan Thomson, an actor looking to revive his flagging career by producing, writing and starring in a Broadway show, hoping to recapture some of the fame and success afforded to him in past by playing superhero 'Birdman'.The story was really gripping, and the character of Riggan deep and interesting. Its no wonder Birdman won Best Original Screenplay. It's a truly unique and clever story told in a wonderfully inventive, humorous, dark and sombre way. A large part of this was down to the characters, who were so well thought out and put together. Birdman gave us a peak behind the curtain of Broadway and the souls that take to the stage, at times giving highly satirical portrayals of a stereotypical Broadway performer. The way that they all interacted was fascinating, with the script so sharp and the acting always on point. The more comedic elements of the film always hit the mark, with all of the characters and cast contributing to this.Birdman has such a great ensemble cast, any of whom could have been awarded an Oscar for their performance. Not a foot put wrong in the whole cast. Keaton, Stone and Norton were all fantastic, all giving very varied performances which kept you on your toes. Zack Galifianakis was great in a serious capacity, and Naomi Watts also delivered a great supporting performance. If you need any convincing watching Birdman, the acting alone is worth it.What really stands out for me is the camera work and direction. The shots tracking through the theatre was so intriguing, bringing Broadway to life in a thoroughly unique way. Inarittu mapped out the environment of the theatre so cleverly with the choice to film this as a one shot. This was used to great effect in showing the relentlessness of the pressure that was being exerted on Riggan, both by himself and by the stress of launching a Broadway show. There was no let up as we felt like we were living in the moment with Riggan and the rest of the cast. The direction reflected this perfectly and cultivated an atmosphere of anxiety and desperation that was breathing down on the characters as well as us as an audience.
.
Simply put Birdman is fantastic. You can tell that so much care was put into this film from everybody involved. It delivers everything you could want from a film and will keep you most entertained for 2 hours."

Film revolves around Riggan Thomson, a fading cinema superhero, plans to resurrect his career with a passionate Broadway production, his ignorance and stubbornness' to accept reality makes him an annoying disturbed old guy. Michael Keaton as Riggon is surely the perfect fit for the character and he nailed it totally along with some watchful support by the seasoned cast including Edward Norton. Cinematography and Direction is something to look for in this masterpiece, once you'll start with this movie you'll probably get the feeling that film has been picturized in a single extended shot which shows the sheer brilliance of Emmanuel Lubezki & Alejandro. Film has bagged 4 Academy awards in 2015 including Best Picture, Director, Cinematography & Original Screenplay."

Too many sub plots opened then abandoned instead of being explored, and the whole super powers thing. I get that he played a Superhero in the past, but why did it seem like he had the powers in the real world? Then it seemed like the movie was changing from ""a movie about an actor who played a Superhero"" to a Superhero movie (with a scene reminiscent of the battle of New York in Avengers"".

""If you are there and no one knows it, do you really exist?"" I loved the balance and the transitions between Riggan and Birdman. You never really know which is real and which is not but it also never puzzles you in a bad way.As for the directing and cinematography.. Just wow.

The movie is about how the voice in Riggan's head and its desire to for fame, money combined with his own lust for approval and his empty past leads to self loathing, culminating in him realising that the one important thing in his life is his family.

So I had to see why was this movie better than Interstellar that wasn't even nominated and guess what? It wasn't. I'm not trying to make this review about Interstellar but the Academy really got everything wrong that year, even American Sniper was nominated but Interstellar was not, like really? Although all of this I will no try to compare them and give my honest opinion about the movie.In terms of direction I must say that this was the best one shot movie I've ever seen with smart and beautiful transitions from one scene to another. The photography was also pretty good and overall this has some pretty good cinematography, is not one of those one shot movies that you get bored by the way it his made and for the fact that the camera is always following up, to be honest I even forgot it was one shot at some point. This movie has also a top-notch acting and perhaps some of the greatest acting of the last decade but of course I have to highlight Edward Norton and Michael Keaton!About the plot itself this is not one of the most brilliant and complex stories that you will see but it's pretty decent. The main character has an alter ego that speaks with him which adds something interesting in the story. The movie is all about broadway and everything about actors and theater and watching this movie really feels like watching a theater and they deserve recognition for that. This contains some interesting dialogues and ideas and I loved the scene when the critics were criticized and the dialogue in it. It also talks about trending nowadays and popularity and in a certain way criticize and satirize it. This also won Best Soundtrack and once again I think that the Academy got it wrong because the Soundtrack is pretty good but ain't even near of Interstellar's, sorry I know I said that I would not compare them but in this certain aspect I really have to.I don't want to give spoilers about the last movie events but the final scene was interesting and I really liked that!

By the comments and from the critics, I thought this movie is an another overrated one but I was wrong, it really deserves all the credits!
The only down was in my personal opinion, was the camera movement. I understand they tried to shot one scene, one place however in my opinion, it was forced too much.
Overall, this is a must see movie. By far in this decade, one of the greatest one! I'm not exaggerating neither the other comments."

The Ending is kinda Complicated and Director leaves everything to you to conclude the theory of the film (which kinda reminds me of the inception ending) which leads Birdman to Oscar of the best writing.

" One Take Wonder
",0.0,0.9939,2020-03-25 00:00:00,8,"""Birdman"" is directed by Alejandro G Iñarritu and stars Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone. This film is about an actor trying to find his place back in the world again, becoming relevant in today's age, with his new play on Broadway.This film is about a wide range of subjects and themes, as the main character, Riggan Thompson (Keaton) goes through in his life. He was once a praised actor, playing the role of ""Birdman"" in a comic book superhero film. He is now known for that role, despite probably portraying many other characters in films. He has an estranged relationship with his daughter, Sam (Stone), that he is trying to reshape. Sam is just out of rehab and dealing with her own issues. Mike (Norton) is an actor Riggan hires after his other actor gets injured on set. Mike is very good at his job, but a difficult man to work with.Keaton is terrific as Riggan. The character resembles the actor in a way. Michael Keaton is known for his famous portrayals as Batman and Beetlejuice, despite playing many other characters in other films. Riggan is the same way, only being known for Birdman, and the way he protrayls Riggan is great.Norton is equally great as Mike. He is literally playing himself in this character. Edward Norton is infamous for being a difficult actor to work with, which he acknowledges in his own way.The cinematography is ambitious but amazing. Only 16 visible cuts through this film that seems like it is one shot. Therefore the direction, production design and acting all holds up with, and is amazing to see these long scenes unfold.The film has a great drum-only slick, jazzy soundtrack, that fits uniquely with the film. It's raw and dry, like how the film plays out.Th film ends with a powerful punch to the audiences. Riggan takes a real gun and purposefully shoots himself on stage during the play, trying to kill himself. Shooting his nose off, he wakes up in a hospital being taken care of, and getting great reviews from critics of his play. As Riggan hit the stage floor after firing the gun, audiences clapped at how real the scene looked. One woman even walked out. This symbolises how critics love the realism of the stage no matter how real it is. Audiences had the right to think the gun was fake, and whilst it wasn't fake, audiences bought the realism of the play. In the hospital, you can tell Riggan regrets his actions. He got the fame and the great reviews of his play, but at what cost.Birdman is a film about many subjects and themes, with an ambiguous ending that leaves the audience wondering what it all meant. A worthy watch.Overall: 8.4/10"

It leaves the audience feeling bored, confused, annoyed, or all of the above. Although this seemed to be the film's intention as it lacked so miserably in what is most important. Story. Accompanied by jarring (and frankly, pointless) jazz drums, unnecessarily long takes and awkward attempts at being a slick movie. The only praise I can give is to the actors. Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, and as much as I hate to admit, Edward Norton deliver exceptionally, given the circumstances. I suppose also the camerawork was at times captivating.

It also speaks well to anyone who has aspirations and how those aspirations affect you and the people around you. Yes, there was redundancy in the movie but so is there in life. Very few people in life learn or adapt from a single experience. We often fail again and again even when we are doing things right.

I gave it 2/5 and at that time I wasn't really into movies, I just basically watched superhero movies with my friends. I was so wrong about this film and I'm angry at myself for not revisiting it earlier.Birdman is one of the best character studies and definitely a techincal achievement. It critizices current state of cinema in which superhero movies earn all the money and essentially the audience (me at that period) who only care about superhero movies. It critizices movie and theatre critics who don't care about people behind the movie, critics who make up their mind before they've even watched the movie, critics who don't know what to write so they write random quotes.Honestly, I prefer Birdman's one take over 1917's onetake simply because I find it more effective here. I particularly love the shots when there is mirror in shot and Lubezki's cinematography is impeccable.In the end, this is all about our main character Riggan, how he strives to get back into movie industry and not become another name in the crossword, how he wants to create his legacy and leave something important behind. In the essence it is about being human."

You can actually feel the emotions the main character is going through because whilst they may be surreal in some cases they never fail to be relateable. Judging the Riggan as a character is incredibly difficult because you can't help but feel that you'd act in a simmilar way if you were in such situations. The camerawork in this movie is beautifully executed and feels almost dizzying whilst remaining grounded and emersive. There is not one route this movie takes that feels out of place or rushed which makes the viewing experience so captivating. Inurratu manages to tell a story that resonates with the viewer on such a deep human level whilst never feeling pretentious or distance. I cannot wait to watch more of his work & see what his beautiful mind can come up with. Would highly recommend!"

Iñárritu envisioned a script so witty and thought-provoking that only a true visionary like him would be behind the camera to understand. The message underlines what acting and the box office truly means to a person even if the main populist is indifferent whether blockbusters or artistic art should be the ones praised. Honestly, all of this couldn't have been possible without the phenomenal actors attached to the film with Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone being the stand out performances. Don't even get me started with the excellent editing, long-takes, cinematography and drum score that elevates the experience to an even greater one. There is a reason why this film is praised and dares others to soar above the ground like Riggan himself."

",0.0,0.9865,2020-01-07 00:00:00,10,"I guess the actors.The film's performances, spearheaded by screen titans like Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone is absolutely fantastic. Keaton is in his S-game, somehow being able to dig out the deepest emotions from audiences, yet also able to tone it down when certain scenes of him being outperformed by Edward Norton's character are playing. Edward Norton's emotional mess of a character serves as a counterbalance to Emma Stone's explosive emotional mess. The dynamics between all characters are all interesting and compelling, and oh my God this is only just the three main leads.On the technical aspect, this is a film with cinematography so great and editing so sharp that the film is perhaps the reason I began to overanalyse filmmaking technicalities. The long takes, tricky shots and seamless transitions are straight up mind-boggling. Couple that with the amazing percussion-driven score, and what you get is truly a film that has a life of its own. The plot explores a pretty commonly-done theme, however the script here is organic and downright relatable. The film really does not coddle audiences, it is rich in subtlety and thought-provoking moments, dialogues and visuals."
" apparently many has been confused by this movie.
",-0.3182,0.5558,2020-01-04 00:00:00,9,"A movie that makes one confused is often considered a bad movie. i suggest whoever reading this to first read the negative reviews, if i may.this is entirely what i took of this movie, as what it is.this very movie doesn't show a specific progress of time. and i take it that's why some people don't see 'any' progress at all. they confuse plot with time progression, thus with little to no hint of time they concluded that this is going nowhere. please allow me to make it simple to you: expect all events in this movie to take place within a week, and there are time skips when it's suddenly evening or afternoon, even the next day. (almost all of it is shot in a building so we can't look for the sky, and almost no clocks shown explicitly.) it's kinda detailed, shows what is going on behind the scenes, so with no cuts, it emphasizes that there is nothing that's not important here. (slightly arguable though, but i think so since that's we can see)yes, maybe this movie is an impression rather than expression. but that often comes back to ourselves. see, there are people who looking deep into it to have a conclusion like ""oh, so you wanna impress me. with {mentions what they do}. well, i can read into this so I'm not impressed"". in contrast to that, i see this as a complete expression, as what it is. I don't look further as there's no need to guess. no idea to look further like Inception. no.and this movie is good."

",0.6597,0.7003,2020-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Phenomenal movie. I heard that it was good, but this movie was way better than I could have imagined. If you live movies, this is a must-watch."
" And the movie of the decade-award goes to...
",0.0,0.9995,2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Ah... what an achievement. I though that I'd never make a review about this perfect movie... but f#ck it.The Academy award winning screenplay is in my opinion probably the second best of the decade, behind Bir Zamanlar Anadolu'da for a slight bit. There is just so much thought and effort put in it to make a sensible comical story. There's many quotable lines in it and all of them fit to the characters perfectly. Characters are amazingly written and developed perfectly.
For me, the comedy in it wasn't all that funny. I'd criticize this movie for not being funny, if there wasn't one bit that changed everything completely. The comedy, made everything much more sad. Riggan Thompson's struggle and unpopularity was trying to be funny, but for me it made me care more about the character - Riggan Thompson is just like Llewyn Davis. It didn't make me laugh, but I'm sure that it made someone else laugh his/her #rse off.The acting in this movie is phenomenal and I'm shocked that no-one got an oscar for their performances. Even the more minor roles, like Zach Galifianakis's, were great. Michael Keaton's performance was mind-blowing, Edward Norton was spectacular and Emma Stone was the perfect icing on the marvelous cake. For me this is the best performed movie of the decade.
...And I got to ask the Academy Awards, how Patricia Arquette's performance was better than Emma Stone's?!The cinematography is fantastic, it's something that many other movies fail at. For a guy like me, who cares even more about the cinematography than anything else... it's just beautiful. The best way to define the cinematography, would be comparing it to ""9th Symphony by Beethoven"", both are just incredibly beautiful. The way of making it look like a continuous is meta and perfect. Having the shot looking like it's continuous needs everything to be perfectly timed and that's where the directing comes in. Alejandro G. Inarritu makes everything seem so perfectly timed, that anyone else couldn't probably do. That's the reason why Richard Linklater shouldn't have won an Oscar for directing, and I'm happy that he didn't. Cinematography was the best of the decade, beating even Bir Zamanlar Anadolu'da which had also a very beautiful cinematography.The soundtrack for this film was the third best of the decade for me, with Inside Llewyn Davis and Gustavo Santaolalla beating it. The drum soundtrack was amazing and it accompanied the movie really well. Of course, people's tastes are different, but I seriously recommend you to listen it.As a whole, this movie is an achievement and technical marvel that everyone should at least check out. For a small budget of $18 million, it's amazingly made. $18 million isn't a small amount of money, when we think that Whiplash took only $3.3 million to make, but to achieve this much with only $18 million, it's just f#cking amazing.
I don't think that I can find enough words to tell you how amazing this movie is. There is just so much to talk about it, but this is as much as I can tell you without spoilers. I can't recommend this movie enough so please, do me a favor and watch this movie.I'm really happy that Academy Awards gave this the Oscars that this movie deserved, but I can't forgive them for not giving any Oscars for acting. This movie got the attention that it deserved and I'm happy that Alejandro made this and Revenant in a row. It's a new decade now and I hope that Alejandro makes a comeback.Sean Penn: And... the movie of the decade-award goes to...(pause)Sean Penn: Who gave this son of a b#tch his green card?

" A polarising film for sure - watchable but ultimately tiresome
",0.1655,0.9509,2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,"This is clearly a love-it-or-hate-it film - one seldom sees so many 1s and 10s on IMDb for an Academy Award-winning film. I give it a solid 7 for being watchable, somewhat thought-provoking, made me google a few things, made me think once or twice, laughed a similar number of times.Loved:Interesting cinematography. The single-take process is captivating in places, most notably Michael Keaton's quite astonishingly long (though inaccurate and a tad contrived) lapping of the outside of the real-life theatre through Times Square, as well as the technically excellent long day-night shot of the environment. Both scenes had me going, ""Wow, that was very nicely done indeed.""Themes. Raymond Carver's take on love in the protagonist's Broadway adaptation of Carver's famed short story had me reading up a bit. Emma Stone's Sam's excellent monologue that ties that somewhat shaky narrative together.Honesty. Keaton and Norton sort of play themselves, their perceptions by their industry, though vamped up.Didn't love:The neurotic and chronically self-congratulatory introspection on the craft of acting, by insiders, for insiders. Hollywood blockbusters versus 'serious' Broadway is oversimplified, too easy, too unsubtle, too navel-gazing for outsiders.Could have done without:The tired tropes, like the nasty too-powerful newspaper critic, ""I'm gonna kill your play,"" seriously?, daughter just out of rehab.Gratuitous lesbianish and attempted rape scenes, and name-dropping George Clooney and Farrah Fawcett in script that simply didn't work.Length, two hours feels too long for a film with no real plot or character development to speak of.Pretentiousness, what does ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" even mean?Birdman is a somewhat interesting portal into a schizophrenic world occupied by some American actors - money-making comic-book franchises versus ""a thousand rich old white people whose only real concern is going to be where they go to have their cake and coffee when it's over."" It's a niche schizophrenia."
" Birdman: The Truths That We Wish We Could Deny
",0.4767,0.9903,2019-12-25 00:00:00,9,"Birdman, starring Michael Keaton, previously known for playing in one of the best Batman portrayals alongside Joker Jack Nicholson, is a film that gives us, conceptually, a status-quo of the world we live in, addressing what I found myself calling ""the truths that we wish we could deny.""The plot is centered around a washed-up Hollywood actor, Riggan Thompson, who in his younger days played the role of a masked super-hero by the name of Birdman (notice why Keaton is perfect for the role?), a franchise that found great success in the mainstream audience. After three more than successful highly action-packed films, Thompson decides to retire from the Bird's mask, and to find a career in Broadway playwriting as he writes, directs, and stars in an adaptation of a 1981 book titled ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" Throughout the film, we are exposed to Thompson's struggles in the leap from the mainstream film industry to the more subtle, artistic, and critical stage of Broadway, from the anger of theater critics, the audiences, and Thompson's very own family. The voice of Birdman, which has since grown into his alter-ego comes to him and haunts him in his darkest hours, and for some reason, that ties in with Thompson having telekinetic powers (but I'll let you watch that and interpret it however you like).The main cast is perfectly fitting, starting with Michael Keaton who draws the similarities between his real-life struggle to leap from Batman to a more realistic actor and Thompson's Birdman. The co-star, in my opinion steals the show, as Edward Norton plays Mike Shiner, a very famous Broadway actor who takes over a role at the very last second of rehearsals. Everything about Norton in this film is wonderful. He carries himself like a God of the Stage, he smiles, talks, walks, and reacts perfectly in every single scene. I couldn't get enough of him. Thompson's unstable daughter, who works as his assistant, Sam, is played by Emma Stone, and Zach Galifianakis, from the Hangover plays Thompson's attorney and best friend. The dynamic in the cast is explosive, especially between Keaton and Norton who I wished just had a film of them acting on a Broadway stage.The most important aspect of the film, and honestly, what makes it truly memorable, is its cinematic appearance. In one word, I must say it is unorthodox. The film is made to play as one big scene as the camera never shifts from a picture to another and gives us a seemingly first-person view of the backstage region of Broadway. By great editing, long takes, and the incredible talent of the cast, this created a sense of reality and anxiety at every point in the film. Accompanied by the camera work, the film score consisted mostly of jazz drums, which made every single scene incredibly enjoyable. Usually, in most films, a scene is centered around the music that's playing, and the music will then dictate the atmosphere. But in Birdman, the music is not an atmosphere setter; it is a character of its own. It fits into the conversations, and into the scenes. It reminds me of one of my favorite moments in music, when in Kendrick Lamar's ""To Pimp a Butterfly,"" Kendrick is having a conversation with pre-recorded Tupac Shakur interviews, and slowly, but surely, a rambling jazz tune comes waltzing in, interrupting the conversation, until Tupac disappears from the conversation, and we are left with Kendrick, in the heat of a jazz band's rambling, screaming the name ""PAC!"". This is true cinematic art, and Birdman masters it.I spent a few minutes thinking about some flaws and here are minor ones, without giving too many spoilers: Norton does not appear as much in the final act of the film, the last scene is extremely controversial (maybe even unnecessarily so), and Thompson's telekinetic powers, and their consequences haven't sat well with me. That's maybe all I can think of.Conclusively, I believe that Birdman's point hits the target, and hits it hard. It will make audiences think about what they really like about cinema and entertainment, about reality and fantasy, and about the ever-growing consumerist culture in the world. This is what makes Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) an essential."

I just now realized the irony that Emma Stone was in a Spider-Man movie too. Different one, but still. Edward Norton had been The Hulk at one point on top of that. Keep an ear out when you're watching for all the references to things like that and even to Michael Keaton's career. I bet several flew right over my head without me even realizing."

",0.8481,0.9972,2019-12-06 00:00:00,10,"Now we have a satire, yes people this movie is a satire, and a great one. So this movie plot in a ambiguous way is that there's an actor that once was movie star for playing a superhero and the years passed and now he is forgotten by everyone and he's only remember by the guy who once was birdman.So if you pay attention to this, if we take out the word birdman and instead with put Batman, we might have the same plot for a movie or documentary for obvios reason ( Michael Keaton ). So this satire takes irony to another level almost making a documentary for Michael Keaton but I think this movie has brought to the spotlight again, and he was lucky to be on hands of Alejando iñarritu and wonderful cast with Emma stone, Naomi Watts, Edward Norton ti name a few. For my taste this movie is was one of the best films of 2014, winning the Oscar for best film in 2015 for a good reason, because also we had an excellent continuity of the movie, so the movie looks that it has a continuity that never stops.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, a great black comedy with great performances and beautiful shot that it a must watch for movie fans and people that appreciate art."

But when you say ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" you think you're going to watch a very philosophical movie. I also find it unnecessary to try to make the film look like a single shot. The long plans of Emmanuel Lubezki's Gravity and Children of Men with Alfonso Cuaron were much more meaningful. Acting is fine. You have to watch it, but not to exaggerate."

",0.5719,0.9948,2019-11-10 00:00:00,10,"A dark comedy, a tale of love not to be, an exploration of cinema and theatre, a deconstruction of superheroes and their films and a modern masterpiece of technological filmmaking.Birdman has been my favourite film ever since I first watched it in 2014, and it hasn't faltered in any way since then.This is a film that so elegantly dissects theme and intent from the superhero genre, theatre productions, Raymond Carver and his work, modern art and the reason why we struggle and how we strive past it. This is a film that breaks the confines of the screen and shows you what you've been thinking about for a long time.This is a film that confronts the nature of us and reflects something unsettling and ugly, but still believes in hope, love and colour in life. There is a potency to the thematics at play in the film, a true journey of exploration across so much more than criticising superheroes. The film uses this lens to draw you in, a promise of deconstruction, a promise of catharsis, and what is then given to you is something else, something much more profound and meaningful.In terms of ecological storytelling, the film utilises its runtime down to a mathematic precision, sifting through ever scene to get the most out of the characters, actors, metaphors and aesthetic. A blindingly triumphant function is at the heart of the film, where so many other films miss their target with connection and intent through poor overall function, Birdman soars above, revealing a collection of images and sounds that stick with you for years, and of which have stayed culturally, subtextually, filmicly and politically relevant. This is a film that understands that it needs to exist, it needs to be talked about, it needs to be addressed.There is a simple joy to decoding the subtext and metaphor of the film; finding what it means to you and then finding what it means for others. Although surface level, that simple joy is encouraged by the film, by essentially packing every frame with as much relevant meaning and philosophy as it can. This might seem heavy handed to some, but to me, and I think to art, it is working at a level far beyond what you could refer to as 'pretentious,' or 'basic.' To me, this film transcends this kind of bad faith idealism, instead opting to help you experience the rawness of film, the elevated nature of theme and how it can be applied to any time.Birdman is a film that haunts me, I see it everywhere, it manifests in people, places, art and nature. There is something so very finite about the film, something so very true and real to us. I see it as an absolute achievement of art and the work of human nature, and the best thing about that is that the film already comments on that and suggests how and where we should evolve with next."

" A very divisive film for sure, like art
",0.5859,0.4019,2019-10-19 00:00:00,6,"I've read a number of reviews, and am aware that this film won many awards. I have to admit, this is really different from most films out there, with a sombre theme, regarding the terrible state of affairs for actors in Broadway. People who want to make it big but realise it is very different from what they imagined but they are stuck in too deep to extricate themselves, those who have overwhelming egos and seek to destroy everyone but themselves, the very common theme of substance abuse and some other marriage or personality flaws etc.The execution and presentation was interesting, with the normal band music or OSTs replaced by drumming and there being little real music, so we can actually hear what the actors and actresses say in their entirety.The issue I have instead is with the story itself, and the addition of many unrelated scenes, which seem to point to somewhere else. For example, right at the beginning, a few scenes hinted that this would be a superhero film, with Riggan Thomson wielding certain powers. Which made things confusing here and there. Yes, like art it is supposed to be abstract, and many scenes seem to suggest something, then later some scenes depict something else. This sort of directing and redirecting certain focus here and there is what makes this film unique, yet when one really reflects on it, I guess I don't really know what I have been watching. More importantly, which scenes are real, and which are not?To keep it simple and spoiler-free, all I will say is it's a make-or-break basically, looking at the reviews I see either very low scores or very high scores. Kind of interesting, for me it's quite mediocre, and frankly, a depressing film to watch."
" The Expected Virtues of Iñarritu.
",0.3612,0.9989,2019-10-18 00:00:00,10,"Birdman is an overall solid movie. To begin with, stellar performances from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton (in my opinion, the top performance of the film), Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Zach Galifianakis, above others.Alejandro Iñarritu has shown his voluminous set of skills throughout his whole career, but to my eyes, there is no better ""One-Shot film"" attempt than this one. It is known that only 16 cuts where needed for this seamless picture to look the way it does. His direction style is very original, using fast camera movement to create blurred motion, and other unusual techniques these days. This one-shot film has a motive, it was done to enhance what an experience at a theatre would be like. That, combined to the originality and forwardness in the script, prove Iñarritu as one of the most talented directors of the century (so far).Lets continue with the acting. Michael Keaton earns his single oscar nomination of his career with the portrayal of Riggan Thompson, and the interventions of his alter ego, Birdman. I think he did a great job exposing true and relatable emotions. He was very dynamic and managed a decent relation with the minor fantastic aspects throughout the plot. Edward Norton does an utterly fine performance, even though, his character, Mike, has a similar personality to Norton's natural one. Emma Stone proves his talent once again, she plays the rehab-depressed daughter of Riggan, and she does it well. Though for me, she really clicks with her ""Truth or Dare"" relationship with Mike. Other minor characters are worth a mention as well, it is known that Galifianakis suffered the shortest amounts of flubs throughout shooting. Naomi Watts has always shown a bright side when working for Alejandro.The use of color is fantastic. Cinematography has an extended variety of color use, not scrict at all and does magnificent shifts between contrasting tones such as neon reds and blues. Staging (on theatre) looked great, and the inside of the St. James was handled in a far creative manner. I think Cinematography is a very solid cornerstone for this film.Music is marvelous, those jazzy drum beats along all the film set a very vibrant atmosphere for the story, and switches naturally to more laidback rythims when needed. Editing was nearly needed, it lasted only two weeks. Anyways, that is in gratitude of the magnificent job done by the camera crew and the actors.In conclusion, Iñarritu surely deserves the awards earned for presenting us such a real and energetic experience. Of course, his starring actors get a huge part of the job done. With sublime direction and pacing, the story escalates and goes downhill in the most authentic of ways. I'm definitively looking forward on Alejandro's next picture.10/10."

",-0.2023,0.9903,2019-09-30 00:00:00,10,"That it was all in such long takes with so little editing. Thus I forgive the tiny foibles. What an achievement. I first watched this after it came out on home video and I guess I must have put it on right before bed or something, because I couldn't really remember it and thought it had a boring Hollywood fake plot device (silly comic action) when Riggan gets locked out. That might have improved the 1star reviews, sadly. I was entranced the entire time, and was sad when it ended. Bravura performances by many and why I love Inarritu as a director.I am so glad that Michael Keaton got to show off his considerable acting talents in such a manner. I have loved him since the beginning and have never quite forgiven him for taking on the Batman movies, although he was astonishingly good in what little I saw of Batman. All of the cast was amazing; this is far and away the best I've seen Ed Norton perform. Lindsey Duncan made a lasting impression and she was only in a couple scenes. I didn't care too much for whomever played Laura, the girlfriend. She never seemed to connect with the screenplay or direction, which is a bit forgivable as this film wasn't made in the usual and customary manner.The original soundtrack was brilliant and so crazy that it wasn't allowed into the Oscars. Sounds like politics to me. But it really put the icing on the film. Glad it won the Grammy, though.I was reminded of All That Jazz quite a bit during this film. A lot of similarities: Broadway plays, magical/deluded thinking, death wishes, ego and legacy, ex-wife, girlfriend, daughter. But this was a completely different movie, although not a better one in many ways (ATJ is one of my all time favs, but Birdman may become one).It left me conflicted that a major Hollywood studio backed this, as the satire is about the silliness and load of you know that Hollywood often contains. And many of the actors have been in comic book movies. So that kind of watered this film down for me a bit. I wished that the actors bought into the premise wholly, from the outside, and maybe some do (Keaton?). But to wish all that is to wish that Hollywood was not Hollywood and that the Marvel Universe has not taken over Hollywood so completely. Hollywood is lost, probably forever. In fact, this is one of the only worthy Best Picture films of most of this century, as it's just not profitable to make these kinds of movies and no one cares. I've pretty much decided that unless an actor really, really needs the money, that they are all the narcissists they are rumored to be, but I refused to believe (all that ""nice guy/gal stuff""). Why would you need to do more than one? Are their living expenses really THAT high or is the lure of blockbuster love so tempting and even necessary? It's a crazy world and I don't appreciate Keaton for adding to this trend, back when it wasn't one.I am dismayed at all the bad reviews, which I think is reflective of what people expect now. Most of those review I read got major plot points or script lines wrong, so I have to wonder if they watched it carefully or not at all. I think the advance press didn't do this movie any favors as most of the bile went to the ""artsy fartsy"" direction. I don't watch TV, thus I had no idea beforehand. But if I had, I would have been even more impressed. But then I love films which try to challenge the norm (and after all, a play is nothing but 3 or 4 long scenes!). However, this is NOT an art film. That these reviewers have no idea what an art film is shows not to take those reviews seriously. And why did this film elicit so much anger? A bad Marvel sequel only gets, ""Well, I was expecting more..."" and 6-7stars, but this gets all the anger of their movie going lives. I guess that about says it all..."

" Why I love this Movie
",0.6369,0.996,2019-09-02 00:00:00,9,"I can totally understand why this movie does not attract universal appeal. The entertainment is concealed within the story and figuring out your personal interpretation of what it represents - and that I acknowledge may be nothing much but it'll take some time to get there and perhaps several screenings.Many directors at some point pay homage to their profession (Once upon ATI Hollywood, 81/2, The Player, Hail Caesar etc) and this could be Inarritu's. On one level it is about acting and the debate about whether theatre or film requires the most skill/talent or whatever.The cast are first and foremost players within a film about a play - explaining as some have commented the stilted performances; trying to carry to the person seated in the balcony. To reinforce this there are limited cuts - like acts in a play. The players have to remember pages of script and learn stage markers.To further compound there are the casting ironies; Keaton as the super intense over energised charachter that we know so well (which he says is most unlike him ahem!) and Norton playing the script finagler that we are lead to believe that he is. Plus their prior roles as superheros brings a biographical element to their casting along with emma from Spiderman and Naomi possibly extending the role of Betty/Diane from Mulholland Dr.Two hollywood characters feeling they need to play the boards to be truly recognised in the eyes of their profession and another who feels that's the last place he needs to be to act (or live - for him real life is acting). A critic who can make or break a play describing ""hollywoods"" as celebrities. Does this set the scene for where we are about to be asked to be sympathetic? Plus there is a certain air of disdain around the achievement of ""Birdman""; ""Directing and starring in your own play? That's ambitious"".Overlayed on this is human frailty of wanting to be respected and already having been venerated as a larger than life character who was approached with such intensity that the actor became him (at the cost of family) including those in this case imagined, superhero gifts.With the approach of personal, professional and financial failure that not even these gifts can overcome the only option to change this scenario is to die on stage; gain professional attention, legendary status and avoid the sting of failure.Was the end a death dream or homage to the superhero industry where no injury is too great that it can't be overcome and where the hero gets to fly away and fight another day or was the whole thing a play about a play after all... its left up to you.Intriguing story within a story within a story, great script, clever casting and brilliant acting. It his best for me."

A story about a man who misses his past film career with ""bird man"" and now is just a washed up broadway actor, which isn't a bad thing. But definitely not what he wants to be. This is my top 3 favorite movies of all time. I love this movie and is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen."
" Seriously, Best Picture?
",0.5423,-0.9224,2019-08-26 00:00:00,5,"Magical realism in film is tricky stuff because it's just so damned easy to do on film. Novelists don't have the luxury of special effects, so when they transcend known reality, there has to be something mythic driving the scene to make it work (as in Morrison's Beloved or Allende's House of Spirits). It can work on film too--Pan's Labyrinth--but in this film, it's never clear what all the suspension of gravity is about. Is Keaton's character schizoid? Does he really have strange powers? Why do those powers never actually figure in the plot? The script violates many times Chekov's rule that a gun in the first act better go off in the third, though, of course, a gun does go off over and over again and if you can't guess what will happen the last time it goes off, then you weren't paying attention to the filmmaker's all too telegraphed intentions. The ending is downright bogus--why does the character do what he does and why does the filmmaker choose a magical realist ending? What has the character learned or gained at this point? And, why, seriously, did he try to off himself? Does any actor really try to kill themselves because their career isn't what it used to be--and especially before they find out whether or not the comeback they risked everything for is going to work? I can't think of a single actual Hollywood suicide that was simply a matter of a struggling career (no drugs, no disease, no alcoholism). To sum it up, I just don't buy what's going on in this movie. Keaton overacts as usual. Norton is awesome as is Emma Stone as a bug-eyed recovering addict whose sexy as hell. Naomi Watts has too little to do--oh yes, there's also a lesbian subplot with her that goes nowhere as well. And the jazz drumming soundtrack is annoying. I like jazz drumming; it just doesn't work here because it is always the same tempo and tone, so instead of punctuating changes and dramatic peaks, it becomes a guarantor of a monotonous frenzy. This movie is pretentious rather than profound; novel rather than original; self-congratulatory rather than truly self-examining. So, of course, Hollywood creamed themselves over it and gave it the Oscar. So it goes."

",0.6124,-0.5635,2019-08-23 00:00:00,7,"Birdman is a clever film. It is a well made film. It is not Iñárritu's best film. The single-shot film is something so many filmmakers have thought about and tried over the years, but few have been able to successfully do. Birdman is the first to flawlessly pull it off (even though it wasn't truly a single shot). The problem is that gimmick made it more difficult to delve into the characters and story and instead pull attention to itself (the filmmaking) rather than the film. Because there is an interesting story in Birdman and some incredible performances (Keaton in particular), but I found it hard to truly get invested because I kept marveling at the technique."

I loved the originality, but it had this slightly over-the-top, theatery vibe to it that I really wasn't into. That and the way the camera hardly ever got more than five feet from the actors made it a little exhausting to watch. Birdman. It was very well acted and had some amazing scenes but I couldn't get into it at all minus the scene where Keaton roasts the critic. Not saying the movie is bad by any means technically, just it caters to a particular audience. But I just wasn't excited about this movie at all. I saw the ending coming miles away. At the end of the movie, I just felt tired. Maybe it is because of the camera work. In all sincerity I couldn't relate to any of the characters, they felt alien to me, going on and on on their traumas made me rise my eyebrow and watch the clock. to me all the ""bad"" stuff happening was something I already knew.

It's pretty sad when you are distracted by bad sound editing. I guess they had to add loud noises every so often, to wake the audience.It strangely wasn't boring. I was hoping it was one of those movies where things tied together in the end. Nope, it wasn't. I found myself getting ticked off by the end.What a waste.Watch an episode of Fraiser instead.

" The Unexpected Flow of Elegance
",0.4767,0.9933,2019-08-13 00:00:00,8,"And I did get what I wanted from this film, even so. Having heard of this film and its continuous uncut structure, I remained skeptical, but left pleasantly surprised. Innaritu is able to deliver such a captivating story with twists and turns and progress despite it never feeling like there is a break in the action or a moment to catch your breath. This constant continuity kept me riveted and focused on what was happening, always curious to see that next ""scene"". In a way, this unbroken stream also creates an anxiety that allows the audience to really get inside Riggan's mind and feel what he is feeling. There is no time to pause and reflect before the next piece of dialogue or the next preview of the play, and so the audience is constantly holding their breath and waiting to see what will happen.The music score cannot be understated enough. Never did I expect that so much could be done with so little. The drums never stopped or faded entirely, only took a backseat during the dialogue and then thundered back in when needed. Their constant beating underscored the flow of time as it continuously marches forward. The way that it flows in and out of the actual scenes in the movie is beautifully done, as we always wonder where the drums are coming from. Are they around the corner on the street? Or are they all in my head? The classical music used to accentuate Riggan's hallucinations were wonderfully timed and jarring in their abruptness.This film won't be accessible for everyone. It is laced with ambiguity and caters to an artistic film audience. The meta-narrative of film critique and the industry may be lost of some people, but that doesn't stop the film from having a strong emotional impact on nearly everyone. With the end of the film, you will be left to wonder and speculate on your own, as any great film should make you do. Birdman captures something so uniquely human and yet so foreign and fantastical that everyone needs to see it first hand to experience this feeling."

Post middle age Riggan (Michael Keaton) twenty years past his peak movie career as action hero Birdman, is making his Broadway debut. He is directing and staring in his own adaption of a Raymond Carver story. He has gambled his life savings and his soul/sanity in an homage to Carver and a chance to make his career relevant once again and worthy as a whole.
The acting is sublime from Keaton, (daughter) Emma Stone, (fellow stage actors) Naomi Watts and a top draw Edward Norton.
They are helped by the direction that gives the perception of a movie recorded in a single take with very long scenes and non obvious cuts, though in most cases ""time"" has clearly elapsed.
70% of the soundtrack is a mostly wonderful jazz drum solo (there were a couple of minutes I fell out of love with it before I confirmed) that (it) mirrors the clutter of Riggans mind (though not exclusively) heightening the crescendo of certain scenes. It really is a technical tour de force.
So what's not to like? Well not much. The story is captivating, it's well structured and there's a fascinating ambiguity to Riggan (and that's with mentioning his ""other"" internal voice).
One can't help admitting it's more than a little self indulgent, though never pretentious. The story isn't wholly coherent but gets most of the way there.
It is incredibly endearing though. It's constantly funny though more dark and dry than lols. The final frames are over engineered but cute enough to confirm time well spent.
Perhaps not enough to reach the highest highs but there's so much to enjoy here. EIGHT"
" A well oiled machine of a film.
",0.2732,0.4019,2019-07-28 00:00:00,10,BIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance is a black comedy that tells the story of an actor (Michael Keaton) - famous for portraying an iconic superhero - as he struggles to mount a Broadway play.
" ""Birdman"" is what filmmaking is all about.
",0.0,0.9716,2019-07-22 00:00:00,10,"""Birdman"" is a masterful film directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu. It follows a fading actor whom is known for his role as a popular superhero Birdman. He attempts to make a comeback in the form of a Broadway play, along the way he is faced with difficulty reconnecting with his daughter, technical difficulties and hearing Birdman's voice within himself.Exceptional from beginning to end. ""Birdman"" exceeded my already high expectations. Beginning with the cinematography, the films one-take-shot appearance was done incredibly effectively. Panning shots replace cuts in an ambitious and flawless fashion. Mimicking that of actual live theatre. The music paired with these scene transitions is so effective and bombastic!Michael Keaton was fantastic in this film, definitely one of his best performances to date. Everybody else (Emma Stone, Edward Norton, Zach Galifianakis, etc) flowed seamlessly in the story too. I loved the introduction of Birdman's voice talking, nagging and criticizing Riggan. Also the ""superpowers"" coupled with his clear descent into madness and depression was great.Finally, the film sparks up a great discussion on fame, being haunted by a role and staying relevant. These themes made for some really powerful scenes full of emotion and melancholy. But also plenty of dark-comedy to go around! Absolutely stunning and I loved every moment of it.Check out the full review with GIFS at:filmfreakreviews.video.blog/2019/06/20/birdman-is-what-filmmaking-is-all-about/"
" Masterpiece storytelling.
",0.6249,0.9969,2019-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Birdman or (the unexpected virtue of ignorance) is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and follows Riggan Thomson through his somewhat descending career as an actor, all-while losing touch with reality itself. A film of masterful work.Michael Keaton kills it in this role of a man who is plagued by the shadow of his former superhero role, Birdman. With very little success since the superhero franchise concluded, we see Riggan face the struggle of not feeling relevance anymore as an actor in the industry. This is front and centre within the film. Riggan's need to feel relevant taking a constant toll on him throughout the story is a gripping journey, that is not only thoroughly entertaining, but provides an insight into the psyche of actors and actresses who fail to escape that one role that made them famous.The story takes time to explore the flawed personalities of not only Riggan Thomson, but supporting characters also, mainly being Emma Stone, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, who were all the best I've ever seen of them on film. Even Zach Galifianakis was great. Every character was engaging and there was some really great chemistry here, especially between Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.Though the film mostly remains within the same location for the duration of the story, it never fails to look great in terms of lighting and colour. It's a very pleasing film to watch. It was also filmed and edited in a way to make it seem like it was mostly filmed in one take, which I found refreshing to watch as one continuous journey as opposed to a distinguishable three act structure. Aiding the film was it's very fitting drum score composed of mainly jazz beats, which I found as kind of a 'icing on the cake' detail which really made the film pop out.The film deals with thought provoking themes like family reconciliation and severe mental health, though despite being a black comedy, the story never has issues cross cutting between its humorous and more serious notes. One of the greatest qualities of Birdman is the idea of a persons subjective reality, which interweaves with Riggan Tomson's mid-life crisis. This results in many scenes that are left open to interpretation of the audience, giving the film an edge that hooked me from the opening scene.Birdman or (the unexpected virtue of ignorance) develops complex characters in little time, only made greater by a powerful cast, with Michael Keaton leading the show. Difficult themes are tackled yet enjoyable, again thanks to a great cast, writing and directing. Subjective reality is taken to a new level in this masterpiece of a film."
" The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance
",0.0772,0.9879,2019-07-14 00:00:00,10,"Alejandro Iñárritu's black comedy drama about a faded movie star's struggle to stay relevant by adapting a short story on Broadway is a beautiful masterpiece.Micheal Keaton's performance as the insecure Hollywood star Riggan Thompson is absolutely funny, and great. Apart from that, there's also great performances delivered by Ed Norton, Emma Stone.The screenplay - with realistic dialogues, and humorous encounters really makes it an unique aspect of the film.Another important aspect, apart from the direction and performances, is the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, who tries to make the whole film look rather like an experience by his method of long takes. And the editing is also superb- the stitching of the frames were perfect, combined with the drummed soundtrack- top-notch!Summing it all up- Birdman is a movie, more likely the masterpiece of Iñárritu, and should be a definite watch to any movie buff."
" So clever, so different, so brilliant.
",0.8587,0.9969,2019-07-11 00:00:00,9,"Finally got around to watching Birdman, not really knowing what to expect. From the synopsis, I wondered if this would be a superhero film in the Marvel/DC vein and those films, despite their huge audiences and rave reviews, just aren't my thing at all. I took a chance though and what I found was a film that is very good and a piece of cinema that is utterly brilliant.Alejandro Inarritu had made some fantastic films prior to Birdman (including Babel and Amores Perros). He would then follow it up with The Revenant, a film that earned a first Oscar for Leo DiCaprio as well as Best Picture and Best Director for Inarritu. That made it two Best Director Oscars in a row for him because he won the same award for Birdman and upon watching it, it is easy to see why.The film itself, as I say, is very good. Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thomson, a somewhat washed up movie star who is writing, directing and putting on a play on Broadway. The play is beset with the kind of problems that probably affect a great many plays and all the while, Thomson's personal life is falling apart and there's the ongoing memory of the career he had that haunts him, not least by the voice (and appearance of his Birdman character and by the imagined superpowers that he once pretended to have.His urge is to make real art, rather than succumb to the wishes of his agent, rekindle his superhero role (Birdman) and take the easy money. This has to be a bit of a dig at Hollywood's propensity to take less risks than it used to. Why gamble on something original and different when you can just churn out another blockbuster, sell a ton of merchandise and make another $2bn, regardless of whether or not that latest franchise piece is even any good?The name, the characters and the actors will ensure that it's a box office sensation before anyone has even seen it because it conforms to a tried and trusted template. Riggan could be a part of that again but no, he wants to make art and in doing so, he risks losing absolutely everything.Keaton is utterly fantastic but he's not alone. Every actor in this film is at the top of his or her game and they are working so hard and here's why: when I say that it's a very good film but a brilliant piece of cinema, perhaps I should explain what I mean.It occurred to me early on and once it had, I was engrossed. Remember the single shot camerawork in Fight Club? Where the camera flies through a keyhole, swoops across the sky, through a window, down the barrel of a gun and into Edward Norton's mouth? David Fincher, Fight Club's director, also used this technique in Panic Room and Hitchcock was doing it in the 60's. Well, in Birdman, that same technique lasts for an hour and 45 minutes. We don't see a jump cut until the final 15 minutes of the film. The planning and direction, as well as the acting, that must go into composing such scenes and shots is only worthy of, well, the Best Director Oscar.Seriously, I'm not an expert, but imagine this. An unbroken scene, moving from room to room, unfolding in real time over as much as twenty minutes or more. As the scene progresses, everyone must be in position, ready to deliver their lines, knowing that if they get it wrong or screw up, the last ten, fifteen, twenty minutes has been for nothing and they must all go again. They can't say ""we'll cut it there and go from that last line"" because the whole scene is in one unbroken take and therefore, the whole scene must be done again.Apart from the aforementioned sequence of jump cuts near the end (which portrays a dream sequence), the whole film is one unbroken camera shot. Even when time is moved forward to present a new scene, clever editing or time lapse is used and the camera doesn't move. There are no cutaways, cuts, fades, dissolves, screen cards or blackouts. The actors have to learn and remember huge tracts of script and get it right first time. Just like a play. Technically, this must be incredibly difficult because Birdman is a film about a play, acted like a play but shot like a film.Everyone here deserves full marks. The cast (Keaton, Emma Stone, the aforementioned Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Zack Galifianakis, everyone else), the crew (Emmanuel Lubezki also won an Oscar for Best Cinematography) and of course, the Director because Birdman is a compete triumph and an engrossing watch.Inarritu himself described the idea of a full, single shot film as ""almost suicidal"" whilst remarking that he went with the idea because ""we live our lives without editing"" and that's what he wanted to convey. Boy, he really did too.Birdman is an extraordinary film and one that I'd happily watch again and again. You should too.9/10."
" All in one shot
",0.0,0.9986,2019-07-07 00:00:00,9,"Birdman's cinematic gimmick is that the entire movie is seemingly shot in one continuous camera take, no cuts, no edits. In the tradition of the masterpieces ""Russian Ark"", ""PVC-1"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"" (which actually had 9 or 10 necessary cuts, due to the limitations of film cameras), likewise here we watch a story seemingly in real-time as if we were invisible observers orbiting the drama. The art of the ""long take"" is a risky gamble because it involves a lot of extra choreography, production, lighting and attention to detail, and most viewers hardly notice. But it's one of the most impressive things that can be done with a camera.Note: the entire film wasn't actually done in 1 take like the aforementioned movies, but through the use of tasteful cgi edits it's close enough.If that little introductory factoid bored you, then you'll probably be bored by the flick. Yes, this is an ""artsy"" film, but it doesn't lose itself in artsiness like, say, one of those movies that force you to read subtitles (/sarcasm). Through the use of quirky humor, an interesting story, and of course Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of a complex lovable loser, there's enough to keep your attention as long as you're not expecting an action flick.""Birdman"" is about an aging moviestar named Riggan who once played an iconic superhero named Birdman, but now having matured, he is intent on leaving the world a legacy of more than pop culture in tights. He self-produces a stage play, investing his entire fortune, as well as the greater part of his sanity, in it, hoping that the insane actors he hired don't destroy his entire vision.Oh by the way, Riggan may have a few super powers.The plot itself is a mouthful, but the power of this film lies not in the plot but in the tense human drama that unfolds as we explore themes of dysfunctional family relationships (particularly with his Meh-lennial daughter, excellently played by Emma Stone), arrogance in the art world, and of course the tragedy of not being taken seriously just because you wore blue tights for half your career.The gimmick of the continuous camera as well as excellent overall cinematography and staging, is the icing on the cake. I can see how Birdman easily swooped up the Academy Award for cinematography in 2017 (along with Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay).I can also understand why some people hated this movie. It's not an easily digestible entertainment flick, and it is NOT a superhero movie despite it featuring ex-Batman himself in the role of ""Birdman"", so don't expect fight scenes and flying (well not too much flying. And the fight scene was a riot). If you enjoy heavy dramatic works where not a lot happens, yet we are given a peek into the deepest recesses of the human soul (Streetcar Named Desire, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, or any classic stage-to-film adaptation), then this will be right up your alley.I would compare Birdman to films like ""De-Lovely"" (a stylish biopic of Cole Porter), ""Klimt"" (featuring John Malkovich as the famous Austrian painter), or on the lighter side, a great dysfunctional-superhero gem called ""Special"" with Michael Rapaport playing the role of a lonely metermaid who suddenly develops super powers but still can't get his life together.""Birdman"" definitely soars above the flock of common Hollywood flicks. If you're not sure, I think you should go ahead and wing it. Just be aware that Birdman isn't exactly a crowd pleaser. Er... crow pleaser? Either way I think you'll beak content with time well spent. Ok, I'll stop now."

Adding insult to injury, It's safe to say that Iñárritu went too far with this surrealist denouement. Plus, the film is really overlong. Actually, I think the entire last thirty minutes should have been dealt with the same way Riggan has dealt with his nose. Besides, there must be a boring scene every now and then that is also somewhat pointless. I believe this is a result of the overstuffed nature of the plot. I don't reckon there's anything worse than a pretentious plot with a lackluster execution.(1 star out of 5)"

This is truly one of the best films I've ever seen.Everything in this movie was done so perfectly that I couldn't find any flaw with it. Michael Keaton gives the best performance of his entire career and one that isn't just Oscarworthy but one that is ground-breaking and will be remembered for a long time. The rest of the cast also provided some extremely powerful performances. The movie is made to look like one continuous shot as if it were a play which solidified my judgement of Alejandro G. Iñárritu being one of the best filmmakers present. His direction brings a whole rawness to the story and characters that makes them believable.The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is incredible. You feel like you're at Broadway witnessing this character driven drama and immerses you throughout the film. The story handles so many themes and ideas like Family, Hollywood, Critics and many more to a point where you feel worried whether the film can convey so much in a runtime of 2 hours but I can assure you everything is handled perfectly.Overall, this film is a MASTERPIECE! You won't see anything like Birdman and its commentary on Hollywood, Actors, Family and Critics is sure to make you think. I HIGHLY recommend this! This is what cinema is all about."

" A perfect example of a perfect movie
",0.8126,0.9976,2019-05-27 00:00:00,10,"Before I get into the real meat of the movie, let me just say that the long takes in this film are crazy to think about, and even crazier and cooler to see how they edited to look like one long continuous take the whole 2 hours. Also the score is different but great, being strictly drums, creating a good setting and a Constance feeling of a fast paced, industry atmosphere. This especially works in the more tense/meaningful scenes.Now that we've soaked all that in, let's talk about the actual movie part. First off, I understand that this movie, just like all others, don't always work for people, but let me tell you whether you've felt what these characters have or gone through what they have or not, this movie has great meaningful storytelling and commentary, whether it's something that could apply to you or not.The actors are great, Michael Keaton went all out in this, Emma Stone is perfect playing Sam, and Edward Norton plays a very rude crude person you can eventually sympathize for. The following will enter SPOILER territory, me analyzing the story of the movie, so if you haven't seen this and are looking to, stop reading. **(But scroll down to the last paragraph if you want a verdict).Michael Keaton plays the father of Sam, her being in the best attitudes or situations as a young adult, but having these happenings from her absent father (Keaton), a washed up super hero actor who doesn't realize this, trying to find relevancy and meaning in his own life, leading him to wright a play adaptation on a book. Throughout the movie Keaton and Stone have their struggles, Keaton not realizing how absent he's been in her life and a bit of the movie.Not only is his struggle of finding relevancy in the industry and his own life, but this adds to relevancy in his family which he realizes wasn't as great as it should've been. His divorcée and daughter eventually reconcile with him in the end. But all this brings a great sense to they're humanity and how likable they are, which really puts even more blood coursing though the movie's veins and big heart.I also talked about Riggan(Keaton)'s struggle with relevancy is the industry, and basically his life, earlier. This comes from him being a washed up actor of the once famous ""Birdman"". After abandoning a fourth movie in the series, and ultimately abandoning his character, he eventually loses a sense of what he should do, or having a purpose, which leads him to adapt this book into a play. He struggles with a bad preview with his co-lead in the play, who in the beginning is a real ""rear end""(to get this review allowed), Mike(Norton). But even he struggles with himself, which we later find out, because he is unable to be himself except in the stage, once displayed through, get this, his ""thing"" limp everywhere except on the stage. This can be very meaningful to people(not the ""thing"" thing exactly) who feel out of place.Back to Riggan, he struggles in the industry and not many people seem to be picking up his new play, releasing soon. This makes him contemplate himself, and even argue with the voice in his head, which is the character Birdman, spitting out the hard truth but also over complicating things. Keaton also shows signs of possible powers when he tosses things around with his mind, but this ultimately could be in his head. Since there is a whole scene of him flying around the city but then later shows a taxi driver chasing him to be paid. But the ending, which is the one thing I WON'T spoil, can leave this to interpretation. This may also be a comment on his trying to find relevancy, whether he does or not, or maybe also him being free and himself. He even has a great and truthful argument with a critic who is ready to give Riggan's play a bad review without even seeing it, which he then has a rant about how insensitive she (and kinda all critics) are and how pretentious they can be.So there, I've spent more time and put more effort into this review than I would in a school essay. But it's only because this movie is truly a masterpiece, and what all films should strive to be. Something meaningful, heartfelt, and an experience that I will never forget. Birdman is definitely my favorite superhero. This is an example of how film truly is art. I have no problem with this movie, and if you're anything like me, I don't think you will either. 10/10"

" [20/20]
",0.0,0.8225,2019-04-16 00:00:00,10,"Common knowledge would have you believe that 'Inception', 'Mad Max: Fury Road', 'Django Unchained', 'Toy Story 3' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street' are the five best films of the 2010s so far. Whilst I don't think that any of those choices are bad films ('Fury Road' and 'Toy Story 3' in particular are great), I'm always left wondering as to why this masterpiece is left out of so many people's lists.I don't like that word 'masterpiece', I think modern audiences associate it too often with good, not great films. I use it lightly, this is one of only four other films released since 2010 that I associate that word with.I watched this film on DVD recently after it came out... loved it. I thought it was one of the best films I have ever seen, and I still do. I had heard mild rumblings online that a sizeable percentage of audience members were not impressed with it.I decided to write this review after watching a video online. I won't mention who released it but three competitors were asked ""Which bad film, did the critics love"". The three options the competitors gave were 'Citizen Kane', 'Snowpiercer' and 'Birdman'. Three great films. The thing is, after the 90 minute video, I still couldn't understand why the American didn't like 'Birdman' (or the other two films for that matter). However, I can think of several reasons why 'Birdman' was a masterpiece.1) It's bloomin' beautiful. You'll probably struggle to find anyone who doesn't believe that the mostly one take camera movement that Alejandro G. Iñárritu decided upon didn't look great. The problem the American had with this technique is that ""why is it made to look like on take!?"". Why not? Not only does it look fantastic, it also keeps the narrative flowing at a great pace and perfectly shows what it's like to work at a West End theatre, it's cramped, everythings two feet away from everything else backstage and Iñárritu used the camera to show this space.2) The performances are great. No, they are. Everyone loves Michael Keaton, never trust anyone who doesn't like Michael Keaton. I do like Eddie Redmayne and I thought his performance in 'The Theory of Everything' was phenomenal. But I feel like the little gold man belonged to Keaton that year. The Americans main problem in the acting department was Emma Stone... he still didn't give me a good enough reason why. Credit where it's due, Stone was great because she was the only member of the cast who had to properly act. Keaton, Norton, Watts and etc were all great in this film, but I did feel that they were playing exaggerated versions of themselves (that's not a complaint btw). Stone was the only member of the cast who I felt as though was not playing herself, but was adapting to a character who doesn't share to many similar traits. That's good acting.3) The story is great. Another one of the American's complaints was the story. He said, the story and the characters fell flat. Mate... they just didn't. As my Art teacher once said ""You could look at a red box and say to yourself 'it's blue, it's blue, it's blue' but at the end of the day it's not, it's red"". You can look at the story and say ""The story fell flat, the story fell flat, the story fell flat"", but at the end of the day... it just didn't. It is literally said in the film ""People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical b******t."" Iñárritu literally talked to the audience. The rough translation is ""People don't want to think when they see a film anymore"". As the reaction of ""passive audience"" members proved, this statement is corrected.I think the reason why a lot of people write off this film is because they can't be asked to think and get hold of the meaning. I think the reason films like 'Django Unchained' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street' are considered by many two of the best films of the 2010s is because you don't have to think to hard to watch them (I don't like either film, but I like DiCaprio btw). Their good films, but neither are masterpieces.2014 was, overall, a great year for films. 'Whiplash' = great, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' = great, 'Nightcrawler' = great. We also got 'Boyhood', 'Gone Girl', 'The Babadook', 'The LEGO Movie'. Speaking of ""Talky, depressing, philosophical b******t"", we got some of the best, well made and most heartfelt summer action blockbusters in a long time in the form of 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (the latter of which being the MCU's best film). However, as far as I'm concerned 'Birdman' is the king of the castle, the leader of the pack, the rightful Best Picture winner.As far as i'm concerned, 'Birdman' is one of the best films of the 2010s so far, maybe even the best. And considering there is only nine months left of the 2010s, I think it's going to stay that way.(BTW- If you didn't like this film, but do like explodey-wodey, mindless action films... at least have the decency to admit that you're a ""passive"" audience member)."

Now, I can't lie and say the whole one take gimmick was bad, but it was still there for no particular reason. In oldboy, you see the necessity. For this it was impressive, but more like ""hey look at me i can do a long shot."" It had no purpose and because of it being heavily appreciated, it made me look out more for when a cut was instead of watching the actual movie.What confused me most was the relationships. Reggan seemed to be in 15, and I was unsure of who was who. His daughter then sleeps with that unprofessional guy and nothing comes from it. He has an ex wife that still loves him even though he cheated. He has a girlfriend who's not his girlfriend who's pregnant then isn't. I'm not sure!!I liked his powers, but they were confusing. It wasnt solid if he actually had them, which I liked. But then, after he flies, we see him land and then a cab driver asks for him to pay. This tells us he's imagining it, but that's the only instance. I'm fine with mystery, but that one scene tells us it's all made up for no reason!Seeming the plot was boring and had no purpose, I have a better ending that I can say because it doesn't even matter that it has no meaning.Once he gets up and goes to the bathroom, he removes his bandages, just like the actual movie.

Although the movie is captivating, compelling and interesting; it also certainly pops up questions in the minds of the audience. Throughout the movie we see the brilliant performance of Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, while he struggles with the voice of a character that he played in the 90s, in his head. The voice of Birdman represents his indecisive personality, search for character, dilemma between realities and desire for acceptance.
Additionally, in various scenes we see Riggan using his powers such as flying, telekinesis etc., which also puts his delusional mind forward and shows the audience a side of Riggan when he lets Birdman overcome his desires. Although there are many controversies that points out that his powers might actually be real; the scene where he flies across New York, lands in front of his theatre and walks inside, we see that he is chased by an angry cabbie who demands money for driving him, indicating that the entire scene was a delusion. Meaning that the voice inside him, Birdman, demonstrates the importance of financial success, whereas Riggan himself believes that acceptance of people and proving himself critically is important.
Moving on to the last scene, no one can say whether he died, or he is still alive and knowing this wouldn't chance the main message of the movie. From the very beginning of the movie Riggan wanted to be loved and accepted; therefore, the people of New York lighting candles for him, praying in the streets, the top critic praising his work and most importantly his daughter finally being close to him shows that his life goal was fulfilled. This might be real, fake, dream, or whatever else...but still doesn't change the fact that he is happy, whether he or us can tell if it is the reality or not.

This movie both made my laugh and cry (mostly the latter) and is one of the best and most beautiful of films I have ever watched. It touched me on a level I had not yet experienced, and has made my thoughts go wild, to say it mildly.The acting is fenomenal, and solely based on that fact, I would recommend it to almost anyone. The dialogue is so aware of itself to the point that you feel that you are drawn into the character's world (in my view at least).As a 20 year old, who cannot come to terms with my own mortality, the excange of words between Stone and Norton (where they first meet on the ""roof"" still haunts me. The two are (of course) very different places in their lives, and while playing 'Truth or Dare', Stone dares Norton to tell her what he would do to her. Norton replies, that he would take out her eyes and replace his own eyes with hers so that he could see the street the same way she did at her age.Haunting, beautiful and sentimental."

Thanks to an intelligent script, great directing and elite performances in both main and supporting cast, Birdman takes you on an unforgettable journey that's about mental health, consequences of ambition, father-daughter relationship, romance and its complications, artistic vision, celeb culture vs.passion for acting, jealousy and competitiveness.
The stand out scene imho is where Keaton is acting that he's acting, before he aggressively lashes out on Norton's character (who btw is equally impressive) and the confrontation is spell binding. You forget everything around you, somehow you're just sucked into the universe and are a participant, you can almost smell the flowers in the vase and feel the air when he later floats above the tall buildings and his frantic rants are full of heart wrenching sadness yet amusing in its revelations.
Emma Stone is the other half of the heart and soul of Birdman, her fragility, sarcastic and completely spaced out persona manages to make the viewer feel both empathy and mild repulsion, she owns every scene she's in.
The only reason why I didn't rate this 10 is because it could've been a bit longer. It's such a rare emotion, often there's a natural need for an ending, a resolution but this time I simply was so struck that I wanted it to continue just a bit more.

The colours throughout are key to these shots not becoming tiresome - bright neons and glowing warm lights bathe the set, emphasising the emotions felt in each scene. Perhaps my favourite part of the film, however, is the seamless interlinking of both scenes and music. More than once, the near constant drumming accentuates scenes so well, along with the amazing orchestration of movement in and out of the theatre itself.As for the cast, you couldn't ask for much more - Keaton is great as a slightly haywire actor on the brink (with his alter ego muttering alongside him), but Norton shows his true ability by nailing the range of an aggressive, temperamental but caring theatre journeyman devoted to his work above all else. Stone, Galifianakis and Riseborough also lend their talents well.Birdman is worth watching purely to admire the feat of stringing these long takes together: however, a worthwhile plot and intriguing development also gives this film an edge not seen often in cinema today."

It is a bolt from the blue and the more times I watch the more I am convinced it beyond words and description.I think my appreciation of the film can be summed up in a single, but not simply, question. Is Keaton actually acting in the film?I will also remark that it isn't hard to get this narrative into actual superhero tropes. After all, before the big show, a penultimate showdown with the actor's nemesis, i.e. the critic, takes place.

It becomes obvious what are the intentions and relations of all characters within 15 minutes and that's basically it. It doesn't get any deeper, there is no progress in anything but the same emotions of the characters over and over again.
... and it is sooo predictable. It is obvious what will happen in the last 30 minutes of the movie. It was clear how relations between characters evolve (if i can say so because it lacks any depth again).

Overall, the first two-thirds of the movie are too magical, and it should be very difficult for ordinary people to accept this style, until after streaking, it seems as if it is suddenly open-minded. The irony of the performing arts, especially Hollywood, is also explicit. The long lenses that follow are so shocking that the plot of the front and back is so natural through the linking of the lens language."
" Entertaining

He attempts a comeback to fame by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway play.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, shows the same adept work in ""Birdman"" as he did in his best works ""Amores Perros"" and ""Babel"". There is almost a playful way the camera moves through the thin zigzag halls of the backstage of the theatre, giving the viewers the experience of the cast and crew in their daily work.Overall, there is a welcome liveliness in ""Birdman"", not only in the directing, but also in the acting. Keaton heads a solid cast that also includes Edward Norton (a standout), Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, and Zach Galifianakis.The story is good but might have been better considering the other achievements in this film. It seems to be trying to grasp something that is profound but only partly hits the mark. Also, a few cheap and old tricks lower the overall effect. A sitcom gag of being ""locked out"" in a very inconvenient way is decades old. Also, the cheap thrill of a spontaneous ""girl-on-girl"" kissing scene may not be as old but it's just as stale.""Birdman"" is still an enjoyable experience especially considering that Keaton (who was a superstar in two ""Batman"" movies over twenty years ago) might possibly be playing himself."

",0.4199,0.9758,2019-01-29 00:00:00,10,"The cinematography is simply spectacular, it is filmed in such a fashion that it looks like a single long sequence shot, and you can't help but praise Alejandro González Iñarritu as a true master on his craft, besides that, Micheal Keaton performance might be the best of his great career. The main character, Riggan Thomson, is so well developed and sympathetic that the plot of the film can become somewhat philosophical and even depressive at some point, but always seeks to make the audience sympathize with the protagonist's feelings on a roller coaster of, mostly negative, emotions, as you put together the pieces from the plot of this bold feature film. The only thing I could criticize about Birdman is that in the second half it mainly focuses on Riggan Thompson, of course he is the main character, so that's not a surprise, but other characters that seemed important at the beginning and also have a good background plot practically disappear in this part giving the sensation that some closure was missing, like his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a former drug addict living with the same man that abandoned her many years ago, or Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) the douchebag experienced Broadway method actor who gets so involved into his role that he sometimes does not seem to be able to distinguish the thin line between reality and fiction. In conclusion, it is an excellent, well-crafted, artistic film, it is not your typical Hollywood movie with big budget and explosions, if you like art and cinema, you will absolutely love this movie."

" A Smoothly Divine Shot
",0.5574,0.9822,2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,"2 January 2015. Michael Keaton plays Riggan, a former superhero on the big screen who made millions and still recognized by aging fans, seeking a comeback with his production of a Broadway play. With an innovative experimental use of a seemingly continuous camera shoot, Birdman offers a first person viewpoint of the behind the scene lives of selected leading characters during several preview productions leading towards the plays premiere. Birdman incorporates at a less surrealistic intensity and plot characterization echoes of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985) as well as suggestive comparisons to Ben Stiller's Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) and allusions to Kevin Spacey's K-Pax (2001), Robin William's The Fisher King (1991) and Pierce Brosnan's dark assassin comedy The Matador (2005). While it's impossible to determine the extent of Birdman's appeal being derived from this fresh use of the wandering camera or the fantastical imagery, only time will tell. Like the surprisingly stark set design of Dogville (2003) or Jim Carey's schizophrenic experiences in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Birdman brings its own unique style to film. The ultimate initial outcome however, is a breathtaking, immersion into a world of petty human flaws, almost humorous foibles of human nature, and of raw sensual, intimately personal experiences.Birdman comes off like a serious version of the purely physical comedy of Noises Off (1992) starring Michael Caine and Carol Burnett. Birdman approaches its subject matter in a playfully untraditional manner that avoids the more traditional docu-dramatic or documentary presentations of Mickey Rouke's Best Actor Oscar nomination in The Wrestler (2008) or Neve Campbell's ballerina performance in The Company (2003), Kate Hudson's Best Supporting Oscar in Almost Famous (2000), or Natalie Portman's Oscar winning psychological thriller as a dancer in Black Swan (2010) but still retaining and projecting a sharp vividness of experience, projecting the viewer and immersing them into the film itself.In brief, Michael Keeton offers the audience a more appealing and oddly enough a more strangely real Lester Burnham character played by Oscar-winning Kevin Spacy in American Beauty (1999) by offering an even broader and more interwoven context of the human experience."

And about great fears of not being loved...What's this miraculous story all about then? In essence the story is quite simple, although in it's display (photography), it looks more like fireworks going off! The basic story though is about Michael Keaton playing a has been Hollywood actor, who desperatedly wants to prove to the critics that he can really act by performing in a prestigeous play on Broadway. Will he succeed and become a critics favorite overnight or will he fail miserably at this new prestigeous theatre role and become the biggest laughingstock on Broadway?This is firstmost a movie about ACTING.

If you go back and analyse it, it doesn't seem like it should work or fit together, but at the time you are so caught up in the little world inhabited by Michael Keaton's Riggin that it seems to flow. In some ways this mirrors the loss of distinction between reality and fantasy which the film explores in Riggin, an actor who formally starred as the titular superhero 'Birdman' in Hollywood movies, now trying to remake himself on Broadway.The film is disturbing in its exposure of the shallow, broken lives and fragile egos of Riggin's cast. Edward Norton's performance is noteworthy, but also unsettling.The film feels weakest in the moments which suggest that Riggin may himself possess superpowers - in a way this makes the whole film seem a lot less real and perhaps it would have been stronger without these scenes."

" Ruminations on cultural integrity is the theatre in ""Birdman"", a triumph of style and substance.
",0.6908,0.9823,2018-12-17 00:00:00,8,"Actually, I WAS vaguely aware of the fact Farrah Fawcett died the same day as Michael Jackson - if not aware the same day, then certainly the same week: I also recall actor David Carradine dying at around the same time. Did you know that renowned English author Aldous Huxley died on the same day as John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas? Reading ""Love, Poverty and War"", a compendium of articles by an Anglo-American journalist, just recently, and with this very review in my mind, I learnt that C.S. Lewis died on this exact same day in 1963 as well. Eerie.Such historical items of interest are at the core of ""Birdman"" - a delicious 2014 film by Mexican director Alejandro Iñárritu which is about what we consider to be worthwhile, with a particular emphasis on the world of art and culture. Nearer the end of the film, the lead of the piece, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), points out the Fawcett/Jackson coincidence, but bleakly noted that it was Jackson who got most of the publicity - as if Fawcett didn't matter. Within the universe of the film, Riggan only recently came through a plane-set emergency which happened to have George Clooney on board too - had it crashed, Riggan theorises that his own demise would have been swept under the rug for full coverage of Clooney's, and that terrifies him...Trying to capture in a few words precisely how it feels to watch ""Birdman"" is difficult - the best I can do is that it is a little like ""The Player"" meets ""Inland Empire""; its technical and aesthetical triumphs are to be marvelled at, but the film is so much more than a mere exercise in style - it has an interesting and intelligent hypothesis; it is attempting to say something; its characterisation is crisp and engaging. Having watched it twice in a week, I still came away feeling like I could see it a hundred more times and not pick up on absolutely everything: the significance of the red and blue lighting which interchangeably illuminate various scenes; whether there is any evidence either way to suggest various dream/telekinetic sequences are really happening; why seemingly random compositions of comets soaring through our atmosphere are important...In a ramshackle theatre somewhere in New York City, Riggan Thomson (pronounced 'ray-gun') is directing and performing in an adaptation of an old play by Raymond Carver. He is consumed by doubt over its worthwhileness; staring monetary troubles square in the face and slowly being consumed by a developing schizophrenia. Years earlier, he was a fictitious superhero named Birdman for three films and grossed millions - now wracked by guilt for making money off the back of cheap entertainment, he attempts to pour his efforts into something more artistic. A scattered soul, he confuses the names of backstage staff he's been seeing for weeks; openly admits to his disgust for contemporary culture ('bad parents raise Justin Bieber'); does his best to keep his rebellious daughter Sam (Emma Stone) in check and must learn to work with a new actor played by Edward Norton, who carries with him his own challenges.Embedded at the core of Riggan's existence is the irony that he will, in actual fact, ALWAYS be remembered within the confines of audio-visual culture anyway: as the man who played a superhero in a set of films everybody enjoyed. And yet, he is desperate to go down as somebody who did something else. Mirroring the film in a particularly uncanny way, so much so that one can never shake the sensation for the duration of the movie, is the fact Keaton himself played Batman in two films before largely disappearing from major the mainstream cinematic canon, only to now pop up in work like this for Iñárritu.The film uses the confines of Riggan's mind to play out the war between high and low culture; of style vs. substance - the internal dialogue Riggan's increasingly antsy alter-ego forces him to have with himself provides us with the essay Iñárritu is attempting to convey in oral form. The argument is not delivered subtly, but with a series of jabs scattered throughout - the first of which occurs in the very first scene wherein Riggan is reminded that a large pay-cheque might have been his if only he'd opted to star in a crappy reality TV show rather than spend thousands on a play for a smaller audience. At its most aggressive, the film resorts to depicting an imaginary scenario straight out of a blockbuster whereby a huge alien bird attempts to destroy the city - a sequence so jarring, it reminds us that what we have seen to this point has appeared to be one unbroken take.The internal war Riggan has with himself is, of course, a battle spilling out into the rest of the world: 'fame' now consists of going viral on the Internet; the 'worst' films make the most money; reading or attending the theatre are niche pursuits and nobody over the age of 17 seems to like any of the music we have nowadays. Lindsay Duncan's character, a merciless critic who hates modern films even more than Riggan, is afforded the duty to outline this with the best line in the film. ""Birdman"" seems to allow Sam to be the embodiment of this brave new epoch: she is pessimistic; smokes weed and wonders what on Earth possessed her father to pour all this energy into adapting Carver anyway - their confrontation is inevitable, and Riggan has no real answer to any of her points, inferring that resistance is futile.What conclusions doe the film reach? ""Birdman"" opens with a quotation that to feel 'beloved on Earth' is to fulfil a good life - there is nothing in there about the quality of your output, while the film's subtitle even seems to conclude that ignorance is a virtue, albeit and unexpected one. I guess raising Justin Bieber makes you a good parent after all..."
" A Beautiful, Satiracal, Character Study
",0.5994,0.9597,2018-12-12 00:00:00,10,"Birdman is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time. Everything from the directing to the casting is meticulously crafted to create one of the most compelling films I've ever watched. That being said, the film is by no means a superhero film. I feel that most people dislike this film because people expected it to be a superhero film. To oversimplify, the film is basically a character study of Riggan Thomson (played by Michael Keaton), a washed up actor trying to jumpstart his career by creating a broadway play. Along the way, we're treated with cinematography that presents the film as if it's one take, characters that are expertly acted by legends like Edward Norton, and a satirical message about Hollywood's fixation on the superhero genre that doesn't come across as too preachy or pretentious. Overall, Alejandro González Iñárritu crafted one of my favorite films of all time and while it may not be for everyone, it certainly left a great impression on me."

Then again, many people and critics called it enthralling and energetic from start to finish, and there was no point where I was engaged or particularly attached to the movie, and I definitely never found it funny. The idea of making a movie that looks like one long shot is extremely creative, and they pull it off brilliantly. Unfortunately, that alone can't make a movie succeed. Keaton is good as the lead, and there are some interesting themes of success, loneliness, and ego but none of them ever shine through or are ever developed in a meaningful way. The ending was silly - how could he have missed and only shot his nose, why was Birdman so in his head, and how could the newspaper story have an impact on viewers? For such a great cast who turn in respectable performances and really creative camera work, it's disappointing to me that a coherent, thematically consistent plot that made me feel any emotion at all couldn't have been attached to it."

A good movie has to address feelings but in a subtle way.
Well this movie was boring, too artsy in a Andre Butzer vs Salvador Dali way. The way you think don't I understand this kind of art or do those critics suffer from some kind of groups dynamic. The camera wasn't groundbreaking at all its just some old technique used again. Its like someone building bricks out of stone with a chisel (cool but not really chain breaking in whats possible). Its like the Band Kraftwerk has made their music with age old instruments, still nice music but nothing to talk about, nothing game changin, like James Cameron did with state of the art techniques in Titanic. The music, one of the most important parts in makin a good movie was a complete fail here. You cannnot take one annoying drum solo and put it on every scene. No Tarantino movie had been good at all if he had taken a f**in drum solo and put it on every scene. Music is a mood enhancer and not some artsy instrument to tell the world hey listen to that drum solo this movie really is artsy.

He hears the voice and character of Birman in his head taunting him....as Carver would write, ""Will You Please be Quiet, Please?""Riggan's fresh out of rehab daughter (Emma Stone) helps out in the background as he struggles with the actors, especially Mike (Edward Norton). The previews were a disaster.There is a lot of personal interactions that are going on. Riggan fears for the worse; that he will be a nobody and not remembered. He wants to do something else besides a cartoon character which is what he did best. It is interesting to note that Zach Galifianakis breaks out of his funny man role and does something serious...which was not as entertaining as his funny man role.The acting was great. Emma stone had her scene where she lets loose on her dad about life. In fact the star liners were all given the scene to shine and they performed it well. The Birdman flashbacks reminded me a little of Jake Gyllenhaal"" ""Enemy"" as you see the impossible, but in this case it was clearly Riggan's imagination...maybe.I could see where this film would appeal to a certain type of movie going audience who like plot, theme, characters, and an under lying metaphor as well as a connection to the plays of the author it presents.

The cinematography is compelling and pulls the viewer relentlessly from scene to scene -- it's impressive to watch. The performances are also very strong.

" Stage Play on the Screen
",0.34,0.9955,2018-10-28 00:00:00,9,"I'll start by saying this movie is worth seeing at least once, at least to see what it is doing. It is shot much like Hitchcock's *Rope*, though not exactly. It isn't all one shot, but there are many shots that flow from scene to scene. The catch? Those scenes are not always chronologically continuous. This is a fact you very well might miss if you are distracted or have something inhibiting you (the theatre I watched it in first however many years ago had abysmal audio, so this was me the first time).This may sound disorienting, but if you change the way you are viewing the movie, I think it will help. Don't look at it as a standard movie: instead, view it as a stage play whose stage is an entire neighborhood, mostly one building, and which was mostly captured as it was being performed by a cameraman. This means that the actors moving in and out of scene have the same flow that a stage play has, and this also explains the presence of the drummer that you randomly see in the background performing the soundtrack to the movie. (Yes, the soundtrack is mostly a drummer; it works really well somehow.)There's only one tiny wrench in this, the movie has all sorts of elements that are generally assumed to be hallucinations or imaginings of the main character (Keaton). In different scenes where he is alone, we see him using various telekinetic powers. Occasionally, we actually see his younger self as Birdman (an action-movie role from his younger days) in person, although usually he just antagonizes him via voice over. Some of the few hard cuts in the movie that do not follow an actor from one room to another are used to establish that the telekinesis in the previous scene is probably just Keaton throwing stuff around the room in anger.How to reconcile this is... well, difficult. It certainly plays with the tension between stage plays and movies. In neither is everything you see always taken literally, but in stage plays it is much more figurative (hence the bending of time and space from scene to scene). But on stage, you usually can't perform the kinds of special effects (characteristic of movies) that we are being asked not to take literally. (I'm trying to stay spoiler free, so I'll not say what I'm thinking right now.)This is where we should look at the themes of the movie, because these formal elements in conflict that I mentioned mirror the thematic conflict between cinema and theatre. Long story short, the premise of the mov... (movie? . . . stageplay? . . . ) ...of the story is that Keaton is a has-been actor, known (very well known) for superhero movies he did ten or twenty years ago, all based around a character named Bat*coughs* I mean, Birdman.Sound familiar? Okay, good. Well the inciting incident in the story is that he is trying to reclaim his career as an actor in general, and with it his artistic street-cred, so to speak, by writing (adapting), directing, and starring in a play. It is based on a novel by someone who encouraged him to be an actor when he was a child. Therefore, this isn't a move of cold calculation, trying to get famous again after years of not being as successful as he was as Birdman and therefore being artistically inauthentic, although he is certainly accused of this. But it is instead a very real attempt to reconnect with his younger, artistic self, before Birdman, which he sees as the inauthentic detour of his career and as not what he wants to be remembered for.The conflict is, he seems to be finding that the film world doesn't translate to the stage world. He seems to be hitting the problem that there may not be such a thing as an ""actor-in-general"" but only two separate things called ""stage-actor"" and ""screen-actor."" On multiple occasions, this film criticizes the spectacles that saturate Hollywood and the celebrity culture it grows in the Petri dish of its award shows. Edward Norton plays his foil, someone else who finds himself on stage more than he does in his natural life, yet a stage insider, rather than a film one.The film isn't all anti film culture, however. In many ways, film has its last laugh when we see that the kinds of things that make the theatre-world fall in love with you and fawn over your talent are superficial as well.The formal conflict inherent in how the film is delivered therefore mirrors the thematic content that is being delivered, which is almost always the optimum result.In other words, I have a lot of respect for this movie. I rate it 9 stars because that is how I say I think everyone should give it a fair chance."

But, I'm going to be honest. The two big stars are Michael Keaton and Edward Norton. I kind of found myself more engaged with Norton. Even though Keaton did a fantastic job, I found myself focusing on Norton because it's satirizing his own behavior. Alejandro does a great job with the movie. However, and I really like you, but I found myself lost at times. It's strange how they added in Riggan having telekinesis. Where did that come from? I also wish they would've added more detail as to why Riggan and Sam have an estranged relationship. The writing could be more thought through if the writers put more detail into some sections.

" Birdman

Inarritu and tells the story of how Michael Keaton was a very successful actor because he was Birdman and now he's just a wash up has-been actor looking for a comeback. Michael Keaton is a fantastic actor and he's very controlling of his play and he slowly starts to lose his sanity that you kind of feel bad for him, but at the same time he's just arrogant. Its kind of hard to describe this movie because the way Alejandro directs this movie is in one shot. There's no edits between two characters like in movies that you watch in the theatre so that was an interesting take on his work, which I've never seen before and it shows that he is a fantastic director. Besides Michael Keaton I think the best performance is Edward Norton. He plays this method actor who is a jerk just like Michael Keaton is and you hate him even more, but between the two you have to admit deep down that Edward Norton does make interesting points. As for the brief romance between Edward Norton and Emma Stone, I did feel like that was just added randomly because this movie apparently needs a love romance. And there were a couple of scenes here and there that also felt random and peculiar, but I loved it as I asking myself are we seeing this in Michael Keaton's mind or is the play just an illusion. Overall I thought it was a fantastic movie with some great performances and it is definitely worth your time."

Micheal Keaton's character, despite being a burnt out actor living in NYC, goes through the same struggles and has the same insecurities as the average person. His character is complex. 
A very creative and original film overall even though the summary may sound a bit basic, the director's approach to the film is very innovative. Great script and cinematography as well.

It's fascinating, it's fun, it's tactile, it's absurd, and it's substantive. Alejandro uses the medium of film to be the message, as much as the setting, the cast, the music, the light, the effects... and even the age of cinematic comic book universes. I could go on and on about the themes of truth, meaning, and reality - but really what's even more exciting to me is how much fun this movie is.

I think that Edward Norton really would have given so much more to the movie if he had a bigger role or more time on the screen.The storyline was somewhat confusing to me, although still entertaining enough for the most parts.I did, however, find the movie was way too long though, and it seemed like it could have served it better if they had trimmed it down from two hours to something like an hour and thirty minutes.

" Greatness or (The Unexpected Satire of Hollywood)

It even manages to satirize how most people just want entertainment (blockbusters) instead of philosophical thinkpieces (everything the Academy nominates) while even snagging the Best Picture Oscar. But one of the themes in the film that really hit me (due to the performances from Michael Keaton and Emma Stone) was how constantly trying to become famous may start to alienate people. This is shown by the protagonist's strained relationship with his daughter.Michael Keaton's performance was absolutely great. He really gave his character a damaged feel, since he's trying to struggle between being Riggan Thompson and Birdman. I've never seen Keaton like this before, and I loved it.Emma Stone's performance was also really good. Although she was a supporting character, she did provide some of the film's dark humor, as well as some emotion (due to some of her dialogue). This really showcases her talent, and I'm glad she won an Oscar the year after (despite her performance not being THAT good in ""La La Land"").A lot of people talked about how the majority of this film looked like one continuous shot. And I've got to say, even though I know that this WASN'T true, it really looks like it was one shot. This film had quite a bit of dark humor, and it all really worked. One thing that really surprised me was the characters' parallels to the actual careers of some of the actors. Most notably is Michael Keaton, where he's been trying to get past his success as Batman and try to be taken seriously; this is strongly represented in his character in the film, who is trying to get past his success as Birdman and try to be taken seriously. Another one is Edward Norton's character. In real life, Norton is known for being a method actor who is extremely hard to work with; in the film, Norton plays a method actor who is extremely hard to work with. Coincidence? I think not.I know that this is a Best Picture winner, but I haven't always had good experiences with those. I loved some (""The Godfather"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""No Country for Old Men"", etc.), but then I didn't really like others (""Argo"", ""The Godfather Part II""). However, ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is definitely one of the Best Picture winners that I can say that I loved.PROS:

" Impactful story telling
",0.0,0.9907,2018-05-17 00:00:00,9,"The film is a rich complex piece of cinematography. It is not a 'movie' but a piece of cinema which satirises 'movies'. It deals with multiple concepts through its diverse array of characters, which I hope allows for everyone to leave with something at the closing credits. For me it has mostly helped me have a better understanding of the manifestation of mental illness, but for others it may open their eyes to the shallow nature of our technocratic age or the consequences of the human ego.This genius piece of cinema is something to be truly respected. As we now respect works of Shakespeare or Chaucer, we should respect this film In the same way. I believe this because of the similarities between both pieces of art, Shakespeares work holds such fascination due to its philosophical qualities but also the limitless interpretations that can arise from his work and this is also true of Birdman. Therefore the film is something to be admired, thought about and analysed, it is not to be consumed simply as a 'movie'."

Think I appreciate the story and the main character, played expertly by Michael Keaton, now, as I can relate to the struggles he was going through. I'm not an actor, and have no allusions to 'Fame', even the 15-minute variety that artist Andy Warhol once spoke of... But, being a near senior citizen, the trials and tribulations of anyone that is over 'a certain age' is something that I, and anyone in that era of life, that also likes a thoughtful AND entertaining story/film, surely can relate to....
We might all not have an 'inner voice' that insults us, and eggs us on to 'Do Better' (while said voice appears, now and then, visibly - and, wearing a super hero suit), but we are fallible, sometimes (often) ego-driven creatures.... and simply just want to know we are loved (lovable?) and appreciated - as we go faster and faster through this often hectic, and at times crazy & stressful existence, on this tiny speck floating in an immense and indifferent universe!
This film is both fascinating and a bit perplexing, so I will have to watch it a second and third time... very soon. But, if you like watching odd & unusual types of films: one that has humor, occasional fantasy & action, and social commentary - and especially, if you enjoy the underrated and excellent acting of Mr. Michael Keaton - then 'Birdman' just might be the film for you?

" Filmed as an apparent 'one-take' for tenuous reasons, this art-flick is well-made and entertaining.
",0.4404,0.9318,2018-04-24 00:00:00,8,"'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance) (2014)' is filmed under the guise of being a single unbroken take for tenuous reasons that, while somewhat valid and certainly appropriately 'arty', are actually rather weak and generally irrelevant when it becomes clear that the conceit was one that the filmmakers wanted to experiment with regardless of the source story, whether it be to solidify its art-house status or to experiment with the technical boundaries of its cast and crew, even when that story clearly strains what is reasonable with this form of story-telling. The first time the flick fast-forwards time while maintaining its fluid style is incredibly jarring, for example, and the second downright breaks the immersion, and arguably intent, of the piece altogether. It is successful in its attempt to appear relatively seamless, though it is digitally enhanced and a few fairly obvious yet slightly hidden cuts do occur, and the one-take mentality almost blends into the back of our minds on more than one occasion. Despite all this talk of technicalities, it is actually the powerful (though clearly 'oscar-baiting') performances and well-written screenplay that makes this satirical piece an enjoyable and entertaining experiment that takes its Hollywood commentary just seriously enough for it to seem genuine, yet not so seriously so that it seems overwhelmingly pretentious. I won't deny that since it looks, feels, plays and generally just seems like it wants to be a play, then perhaps it should've simply been one, though it does use the past career of its protagonist with his new stage-bound setting as an allegory for the overall Hollywood system and it's easy to make the argument that this is perhaps best explored through the medium that it produces. However, no matter how 'arty' it is trying to be seemingly for the sake of being so, it is certainly well-made and entertaining, at least on a first watch. It doesn't quite soar, but it glides from time to time. 8/10"
" Beautiful, unique and thought-provoking
",0.5994,0.9739,2018-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Birdman is dark comedy and drama film. Undoubtedly one of the most critically acclaimed films of the decade, it won four Academy Awards in 2015.The movie is about a faded Amercian actor, Riggan, who is famous for playing the character of superhero 20 years ago. Since then, his career is going through a downfall and Riggan is trying to regain recognition. There are several other memorable characters and the lead's relationship with them is pretty interesting.The film is crafted with masterful directing, music and cinematography. It's really rare for today's movies to touch the themes Birdman hit, like the issues in Hollywood, actors' life, the struggle of people with their ego, popularity, etc. It covers many different things magnificently.I would recommend this beautiful, unique and thought-provoking movie to everyone."

I fell asleep on the couch sofa 20 min after the opening and don't know whether it was due to the slow tempo of the movie or fatigue. I occasionally woke here and there but could only watch the last half an hour so wide awake. And the only reason for 5/10 rating is for the sake of fairness. During my conscious state, I saw nothing more interesting than hallucinations of an aging actor who remained behind his time. If I felt like I lost two hours of my life to the extrapolation of the finale, I'm pretty sure I'd feel more frustrated and act less generous with my rating."
" Birdman- a masterpiece for the ages!
",0.6588,0.9902,2018-04-05 00:00:00,9,"I watched this film with no expectations for the first time last night- and I now think it is one of the best films of all time. ""Birdman, or (the unexpected virtue of ignorance)"" is a 2014 film starring Michael Keaton. For its majority, it is a one shot movie, and they did a wonderful job making this method work. Every shot in the movie had amazing cinematography and the whole thing was extremely visually pleasing. I have often noticed that when filmmakers try to do long shots (like the ones in this movie), it ends up making me dizzy or confused, but in Birdman it did not do this, it actually made me more immersed and feeling more involved with the story. Every character in the plot was used just the right amount- I got to learn enough about each of them to satisfy me, and every character had great chemistry for the rest of the cast. Edward Norton's supporting role, I thought, was easily the best of this movie. Throughout the film, I felt very helpless towards the struggles of the characters, and I really felt like I was dealing with the same problems as they did. A very small problem I had was that in the scene when Michael Keaton's character flys around the city, the VFX weren't great, I though they could have been better. In the end, the movie had a ending that took me by surprise 3 different times in the final 10 minutes- but was very satisfying."
" Lost and Found: The Potential of Birdman
",-0.3182,0.9886,2018-04-02 00:00:00,7,"With the movie ""Birdman"", I tend to be asking myself while watching it, ""What's the point?"". Several ties throughout the movie I felt were lacking due to the style of the whole ""One take shot"" feel the movie was going for that drastically changed how the pacing of the movie felt. The substance of the film and what it gave me felt a little bloated to me personally while compared to more traditionally made movies that I found myself enjoying more. I can tell why this movie could be entertaining to certain people but it's just not for me. About everything I said as a fault are really the only reason I didn't enjoy the film though. The filmmaking and cinematography was great for what it could of been even if it wasn't used to it's greatest potential and I found myself very interested in almost every character in the film with Edward Norton's character being a great highlight. I would recommend this film to anyone just to show them how well shot and masterfully directed this is, and maybe they would enjoy the bits I didn't as well more than me. The thing about Birdman is its more of what you take out of it than what it gives you, which is something to marvel at, despite the fact that I basically found the movie to drag a lot. But the set pieces and excellent acting in the movie more than makes up for it."

What I got was a beautiful film with a great message about Hollywood, and the film/theater industry. Almost every aspect of this film is tremendous. The acting is stellar, the simplistic score works great with the movie, the direction and cinematography is fantastic, and the story is interesting and thought provoking. The dark humor in the movie is great as well, and makes sure to emphasize that this movie is in fact a satirical look at Hollywood. Lastly, the writing for this movie is phenomenal, making the story incredibly interesting and creating terrific character development.Addressing thoughts that the film is too ""artistic,"" for people, I will say this. I personally hate artsy films, but I never thought of this movie as overly artistic. I felt everything worked well within it. As long as you understand that this is a satirical work, you will gain more enjoyment out of it. Part of enjoying film is analyzing, and looking deeper at the art in order to gain something from it. I challenge you to look at it from analytical eyes as you will enjoy it much more than if you do not. Overall, this is a great film that I recommend all movie fans watch. It has a strong message and great writing which separates it from most films. This only gets a 9 out of 10 due to the fact that it doesn't compare to the likes of ""The Godfather."" However, most aspects of this film are great."

What amazes me the most is Alejandru Gonzàlez Inãrritu's marvel direction and the way he projected the deep sense of each character with in just 2.5hours which is really really hard to achieve in that amount of time.

Keaton just came off as a psychotic, schizophrenic, suicidal actor. It was painful to watch, since it was obvious before the end he planned on killing or hurting himself. All it did was make New York theater seem filled with cold, empty, power hungry and confused people. It sucked ~ don't waste your time!!"
" The PERFECT movie
",0.6633,0.9872,2018-02-28 00:00:00,10,"You can't use the phrase ""perfect"" for anything you only love, or that is good, or very good. It has to be all set together very smoothly and just in the right way.In these terms, I call Birdman THE perfect movie. It's a flawless movie that Alejandro G. Iñárritu put it's pieces in the right place. Where to begin? The story and the writing? The story is a well structured story that combines realism with surrealism in the only place they can be together: backstage of Broadway Theatre. The story talks about love, hate, family, courage, fame - how to handle the lost of it-, life and death. The characters are so well written that everybody can see something in common with Riggan. The climax of the movie from the scene when the critic promised Riggan that she will destroy his play to the flying scene is the most powerful climax I ever saw in a movie. The building for that moment from the beginning of the movie was right and delivered it the right way.The directing, cinematography and editing? Well, here comes the good part. With his single shot techniques, Alejandro G. Iñárritu drew his own moving Mona Lisa.I felt I'm with them in that backstage getting ready for my turn.The acting was beyond description.Michael Keaton did his best performance ever, Edward Norton and Emma Stone were amazing. Zach Galifianakis was just perfect. The Music was the glue that hold it all together, drums, just the drums, that made every second of the movie clear of boredom.The movie is about respecting art and film making. Look at today's movies, nothing but superhero movies that lowered the expectations for the people so that they forgot about what movies about.Birdman is a great experience that doesn't come every year. It talks to everyone of us. In the end, it's my opinion. And my opinion that Birdman is my favorite movie of all time."
" I actually like it
",0.3612,0.8651,2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"If I have ever spoken to someone about Birdman I have only ever received slating comments back. I often hear the argument which is that ""it is so arrogant"". I do not understand how though. Just because the subject of the film is related to film making and acting itself does not mean the film is arrogant. You do not call Picasso selfish for doing self portraits nor do you call an author rude for writing about them self. Film covers a huge scale, essentially if you can see it you can film it, so is it not expected that one day we would get a film about actors.
 Is it arrogant for a film maker to portray the struggles of an actor? I say no, it is what it is and there is no problem with that. Riggan's struggle to set up his own idea of who he wants to be as an actor could be related to all of us, could it not? From setting up a shop to becoming a painter we will all face struggles when becoming what we want to be so why complain when it is an actor?
I think, without sounding incredibly hippy like, it offers up so much more than a film with the strange feeling of the well set up one shot almost running in parallel with the feeling of watching play. This is also well rounded with the plot of the film - an actor attempting to run a theater production. It gives us some beautiful shots and is executed perfectly perfectly transitioning between ""scenes"" if you can call them that. The upbeat drum track throughout keeps a nicely sped pacing maintained and the erratic nature of the drummer represents the spinning out of control situation theater is in. 
Overall, I really like Birdman and fully disagree with the idea that it is arrogant.With beautiful scenes and enticing characters I will always recommend it"
" Birdman on a Wire
",0.0,0.994,2018-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Part backstage drama and part study of an actor having a nervous breakdown, (plus that awful alternative title in parentheses) you might be tempted to give this particular film a miss. Incredibly, there actually are super-hero sequences too in a movie which swings between imagination and reality, fantasy and the mundane at will, taking the viewer along with it in its wake. This latter is accomplished by the acting skills of the cast and in particular the free flowing directorial style with continuous camera work tracking the action wherever it goes, imperceptibly speeding up timelines and giving a fly-on-the-wall insight into the tawdry lives of a group of actors trying to break a play on Broadway.Central to it all is Michael Keaton, cunningly cast as an ex-movie star typecast from blockbuster movies he starred in twenty five years before as the super-hero Birdman, now trying to establish himself as a serious actor by adapting a Ray Carver short story into a play. Actually, said play looks absolutely awful but putting that to one side it's all about the characters' interaction, including his smart-aleck daughter who Keaton employs as his gopher, a maverick big-name big-headed actor who he recruits to boost the play's prospects, his plate-spinning manager desperate for the show to succeed as well as his former super-powered alter ego who makes Harvey-like appearances and utterances urging him to jettison the present.I liked the way off-beat humour kept puncturing the so-serious conversation pieces which elsewhere take up so much of the screen time, such as both Keaton and Edward Norton as superstar thespian Mike Shiner at different times caught in scenes unashamedly donning only their tighty-whiteys, Norton's character becoming aroused in a live bedroom scene and Keaton's final breakdown when he regresses completely into his super hero guise.The long-takes and relentlessly mobile camera work is wonderfully inventive and even though there is a sense that there's not really much of a story to tell here and occasionally style overtakes content. Keaton as Riggen Thompson plays the falling apart lead trying to pull himself and his play together. He demonstrates considerable range but like most of the parts here it is flashily written and screaming out for official recognition, which it duly got at the Oscars and more.I enjoyed the film and loved the depiction of New York's Broadway, especially as I've just returned from a first time visit to that very part of the Big Apple. I still have my suspicions as to whether the film will age well and really stands up in terms of content but no doubt actors and directors, budding and established will get a real kick out of it. Not being either, maybe I thought I occasionally saw instead the wires, smoke and mirrors propping it up."
" Birdman or the totally unexpected virtue of failed superheroes
",-0.0571,0.9964,2018-02-17 00:00:00,9,"Riggan Thomson is an actor whose glory years are now in the past; in an attempt to regain the acclaim and leave behind the shadow of Birdman (the superhero that launched him to fame 20 years ago), he ventures to make a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, acted, directed and produced by himself. Just before the preview performances one of the players is injured, forcing the production to find a replacement, which comes in the skin of Mike Shiner, a brilliant but highly conflictive actor, due to his excessive commitment to the acting method. However, Mike is just one of the many issues Riggan must deal with before the opening night: his daughter Sam, fresh out of rehab and who's working as his assistant; Laura, her scene partner with whom is having an affair; a potential claim by the injured player; the pressure that brings the Times critic Tabitha Dickinson, who has the necessary influence to ensure the success or failure of the play, and finally is the voice in his head which manifests as Birdman and that makes him fantasize (or go delirious?) about his time of splendor.In his fifth feature film, director Alejandro González Iñárritu takes a radical turn to his narrative style and bets for the black comedy and satire. This change turns out to be perfect, as he moves away from the stories infested of tragedy and suffering closer to what is known as ""misery porn"", and while they worked in the past for him, in his previous work Biutiful already showed that this formula was wearing out quickly. But he does not abandons them totally, since in Birdman explores the emotional misery of a man looking for a new opportunity to prove he is not finished and so redeem his failures as a father, husband and even as actor and how this search can cost him his sanity, all this with a very corrosive humor. Not coincidentally, Iñárritu has chosen the work of Raymond Carver, since it works as an irony about what love means for each of the characters: for Sam, the lack of it throughout his life; for Mike the love that borders on insane vanity and blinds him to the perception of others towards him and Riggan himself, looking for love in the form of success and lost admiration. At the same time Iñárritu with his co-writers throw a subtle but accurate critique of current Hollywood production system, concerned about over-exploiting movie sub-genres like the superheroes one and make endless franchises for the sole purpose of generating profits and how the same industry relegates and denies opportunities for older actors who are forced in many cases to create their own opportunities in order to stay relevant. On the other hand, it has no mercy with critics and how their work can turn into pure snobbery and some of them forget the sense of objective criticism and move it to the personal level.Iñarritu has managed to polish his skills as a director and this time assumes a big risk by taking them to the limit, knowing that the result could have been disastrous. However, what he achieves is a hypnotic and captivating work. This with the help of a great technical team led by Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, who continues to surpass himself, editors Stephen Mirrione and Douglas Crise, who executed perfectly the idea that the viewer is watching a long tracking shot and drummer Antonio Sanchez, who created based on jazz rhythms an energetic and disturbing score at the same time.However, Iñarritu's best ability is the one that shines the most in this movie, and that's the capacity to create empathy with his actors so they can give the best of themselves and achieve unforgettable performances. This skill has been a constant since his film debut Amores perros and in Birdman takes advantage of a virtuoso cast with Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan in small but juicy roles, Emma Stone as Sam, Edward Norton who find in Mike his best performance in years. But certainly Michael Keaton is the soul, heart and brain of Birdman, at this point is difficult to conceive the film without his extraordinary performance as Riggan with all its nuances, from his emotional vulnerability caused by the fear of failure to his anger caused by his frustration.This is how Birdman stands as one of the best films of 2014 and confirms Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu as one of the most daring and original voices in current cinema."
" Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) - Movie review
",0.4215,0.9983,2018-02-14 00:00:00,10,"""Birdman"" is a film written and directed by Alejandro G. Iñarritu, which is in my opinion one of the best mexican directors of all time. This film is about an actor called Riggan (Michael Keaton) who is very famous for the role of a superhero called Birman that he portrayed back in 1992. But now in today's times we get to see this actor in the lowest point of his career, and during this point of his life he is involved in a theater acting in a play, and the film is about how he has to move foward this project along to get everything working.I going to be honest here, the first time i watched this film was back in 2014, i saw this film in theaters. I was younger back then and my first reaction to this film was: I like this film, is an enjoyable watch. But yesterday my brain said to me (i don't now why): Hey Max, maybe you should watch ""Birdman"" again. So i watched this film again last night, and oh my god...I cannot believe that when i saw this film the first time, i said: Is a good movie. The only word that i can describe this film is a masterpiece.This kind of films are not make as usual as some people may think, ""Birdman"" is a film that is very simple and so original. This entire film is just one take, i don't know how they edited this movie. I mean, there are parts of the movie where we see characters walking into dark rooms and you can say: Thats were they cut that scene - but in this film it feels unnoticeable, and it also makes you wander what is going to happen next, makes it unpredictable, and it works at second viewing. The cinematography here is amazing, Emmanuel Lubezki is a master at what he does. The performances in this film are all fantastic, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, all the performances were impeccable. This movie also features a very simple score, that is just made almost entirely with drums. All things make ""Birman"" a great movie, but the thing that i'm not going to forget about his film is that it also talks about movies, blockbusters, reviews or critics, parent issues, movie roles, actors. This film is also very philosophical in that aspect and i loved it, and it was easily my favorite part of this movie.Guys, in the end, ""Birman"" is a cinematic masterpiece, is a movie that to be really appreciated you have to see the little messages that are hidden beneath the surface, and if you catch them all, this movie will be unforgettable for you. See this film, is you are a film lover, this movie will blown your mind with amazing cinematography, great performances, incredible direction, and an amazing script. I love every second of this film and this film totally deserves a 10/10."
" This movie sucks.
",-0.3612,-0.9978,2018-02-03 00:00:00,2,"This movie is a bad movie, plain and simple. It is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through. It's two hours of nothing. Just nothing. It pretends to be a low budget art film, even though in reality it's just a big budget money- grabber trash film from the same guy who brought you The Revenant, a two hour snuff film. This movie is for people who want to seem intellectual without actually being intellectual. It is not smart, or funny, or revolutionary. Do not watch it. First things first- this movie has Michael Keaton. That's sad. I like Michael Keaton. He's a good actor. The original Batman is one of my all time favorite movies. So for him to be cast in a sucker like this- well, that's just beyond my comprehension. Even more than that, it makes a mockery of him- portrays him as a washed up actor. This film is garbage on so many levels.The film opens, just like The Revenant, with some incoherent hushed whispering, then we see Michael Keaton in a room, FLOATING- and we never see him do this again, for some reason- and it's never explained or anything. Then, we have one cut, and we enter literal movie Hell. From this point on, the film becomes so boring and dull that I wanted to switch it off. But I sat through it, like a prisoner chained to a couch- and I wish I hadn't. My main problem with the movie is that it takes place in some insane alternate universe where, instead of Batman, there's BIRDMAN- who's totally different and a lot stupider, because he wouldn't be one bit scary to criminals, which is the whole point of Batman- but the world is exactly the same in every other way. Michael Keaton is the guy who played Birdman, and he's a washed up bum who's depressed and hates his life and everything. I'd love it if he was just in a new Batman movie or something. Or, maybe, he could be in a BIRDMAN movie- like, an actual BIRDMAN movie- which would be cool- instead of this boring movie about how they're MAKING these fictional Birdman movies. Why make a movie ABOUT MAKING A MOVIE? That's insane. There can be a movie about a washed up actor- but don't tantalize us throughout with clips and shots from a movie that would actually be BETTER. I'd watch Birdman. It would be cool. I don't want to watch a fake documentary about making Birdman. And that alternate title has five long words- which aren't related to the plot in ANY WAY- but they're added on there just to give the whole trash heap a kind of pseudo-intellectual vibe. What a faker.Anyway, after Michael Keaton floats around for a while in his room, the camera cuts- ONE OF ONLY TWO CUTS IN THE WHOLE MOVIE- and we start following his back around, through hallways and up stairs- like some kind of labyrinth- and his head spins around, and the cameraman wobbles like he's on drugs or something- just a very unpleasant experience. It's disorienting- There should be cuts in movies. This movie was boring in part because it's just like following somebody around for a whole day and observing what they do- and that's not exciting- I'm just glad they condensed it into two hours, instead of actually recording people walking around and doing mundane things for twenty four hours. I don't need to see Michael Keaton put on his shirt, brush his teeth, watch TV for a few hours- all in real time. That would be unbearable.Birdman is not a movie- it's more a ""slice of life"" type thing. But the pie which the slice comes from tastes icky. The characters are unlikable- they're all big Broadway snobs- which I'm sure the pseudo-intellectual audience can relate to- I can just IMAGINE them eating their fancy crackers- And I couldn't tell any of the characters apart, except some were women and some were men. The camera just follows Michael Keaton around, and people talk to him about acting and stuff- and I don't know who any of those people are or what the heck they're doing. The one good part about the movie is that the singular long cut speeds up during the night, when one of the characters falls asleep- it doesn't stay there for twelve hours while she sleeps- that's nice.Michael Keaton, in one scene (This movie HAS no scenes, it IS one big long scene) just walks around a table, that's going to be used in some play, and talks with the people about how the table should be used, and stuff. then the camera keeps following him around and up places and down places and into streets and along streets, talking with people. This movie is so boring that it has virtually no plot- just a man walking around and talking with people. I'm just glad it has some dialogue, or I could just stare at a wall for two hours and see exactly the same thing.Now, there is one good part- and this is the only good part- there is one part where Michael Keaton is walking along, like always, and he meets his alter personality, Birdman, and Birdman does cool stuff like throwing cars off roofs and there are aliens and sidewalks blow up and Birdman zooms around and does cool stuff, and people fall out of windows and stuff, but then it turns out that the whole thing was just in Michael Keaton's imagination- he was just going nuts, apparently- then he keeps walking around and talking to people, like always, and the movie becomes boring again. That one event, out of the whole movie, made me clap my hands once. It also allowed me to come out of my coma.The ending is the worst part of it all. Michael Keaton, all depressed from having such a boring, meaningless existence, goes crazy and decides that he's a washed up actor, and he jumps out the window, because he's crazy, and he thinks he can fly or something, and he breaks every fricking bone in his body and he's assigned to the emergency room for all eternity, and his life still sucks, because he can't fly like he thought he could.Now here's the dumbest part- at the very end, he's just lying there, and I feel genuine pity for the guy who used to be cool as Batman- not because he's all bruised up, but because he's playing a character in a stupid movie like this when he could be zooming out of the Batcave- so he's lying there, right, and THEN, because he's so stupid, he decides to jump out the window again, the freaking lunatic, and he goes up on the window, and jumps out- and then there's ONE MORE CUT (The only cut besides the one in the beginning) and his niece or daughter or somebody related to him comes in (she's only there for family interest) and we don't see if he died or if he actually flew- she just looks out the window, and then up at the sky, and smiles, and happy little music plays, and OOP! There's the credits- and we never know what the Hell happened. Did he fly, or is he dead? Is the lady smiling because he's dead? That's pretty morbid. Really, though, I bet they didn't show him flying because that would have been too expensive- and they had already shelled out a billion dollars to hire a cameraman who was willing to walk around Michael Keaton for two hours and record everything he did. This is a sad movie. It's not funny, or dramatic, or philosophic in any way, or inventive, or action packed, and it ruins Michael Keaton for me, to think he'd sign up to be in some shlock like this. Very sad. This movie was so dull- so lifeless, so void of human emotion- that it left me wondering just what humanity had come to in the end. Do people these days go and see movies just because they THINK they're good, even if they're not good? This movie is not good. It's garbage. Thank you."
" American angst
",0.0,-0.6784,2018-02-03 00:00:00,6,"Gonzales' Iñárritu's 'Birdman' tells the story of a once famous movie star trying to rebuild his career, and his sense of self-worth, as a theatre actor. Cue some comedy and a lot of very American angst, as the hero (and his fellow-protagognists) reveal themselves to be simulatenously needy and priveleged. My problem was that I didn't really know what I was supposed to be feeling - I certainy couldn't imagine spending any time with any of these people (or at least, I couldn't imagine enjoying it). Sometimes life is comic, sometimes life is tragic, sometimes you just have to not be so melodramatic about it, a point these protagonists don't seem to have learned.

" The play is the thing
",0.34,0.9909,2018-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Alejandro González Iñárritu has made a wonderful technical film in Birdman with the way the set has been constructed and the movement of the camera to make it look like one long shot. It is also a deceptive film as a second viewing gives you more clues apart from the obvious Chekhov's gun principle.I do wonder if Iñárritu had already signed up Michael Keaton before the script was written or completed. It was well known that before Birdman Keaton was doing inferior films such as Penthouse North and heading television movie land. Although having watched Batman Forever, no reasonable person can fault him for turning it down.In Birdman Keaton plays Riggan, who once made it big as squawking superhero Birdman, years before the current superhero craze. Since then he has been washed up. He tells his daughter a story of being on a plane where he sat a few seats from George Clooney, the plane encountered some trouble and Riggan realises at this point that if the plane crashed, it would be Clooney's face plastered on the papers. The irony being that Clooney was the second actor after Keaton to play Batman and a few years later Keaton was playing a small role in a George Clooney thriller.Riggan is directing, adapting and starring in a play in Broadway to reclaim his career. His recovering drug addict daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is assisting, girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is a co-star. When the main actor gets injured at rehearsal, it is suggested by another actress Lesley (Naomi Watts) to bring in celebrated but difficult stage actor Mike (Edward Norton.)Straight off the bat Riggan realises just how good Mike is, how the play comes alive when he speaks the dialogue, yet also what a nuisance he can be, throwing tantrums. Mike only feels real on the stage, this includes being sexually functional.Riggan needs to get the play working by opening night and impress the theatre critic of the New York Times and she is sharpening the knives for Riggan. A celebrity (she refuses to acknowledge him as an actor) like him does not belong in polluting the New York stage.Of course Birdman is more than just Riggan getting a play ready. In his quest to be relevant, he hears voices of his alter ego, Birdman. We see Riggan moving things by just thinking about it, is he on the edge of sanity or somewhere between life and death?The film demonstrates how good Keaton could be, it is an astonishingly good performance from an actor known for light comedies back in the 1980s. It is a film with good performances. Norton like Sean Penn shows how effortless he can do comedy even while being intense. The real plus about the film is how you can interpret the film. It is a satire on Hollywood fame (with all its cultural references it will also age quickly) but also a reflective film about life and death."

It is well made. But the story is not as great as I expected knowing that the movie was a big hit, critically acclaimed and won a lot of awards. It is just one of those movies by Hollywood stars about Hollywood. They sure know how it works so the movies usually end up being pretty good. At the same time maybe there is something I am missing because I am not part of the show business. There isn't much originality for us, the common folks, watching the movie.What made me very impressed though was the acting. This was totally on top and if I would rate acting only, without how interesting the movie was for me, I would give it a sure 10. Michael Keaton is absolutely perfect. So was Edward Norton. Emma Stone surely impressed me and made me see her a serious actress with a lot in her future. I was also very impressed by Zach Galifianakis whom I already love as a comedian but who managed to take a more serious approach with his part in this movie.I sure recommend people to watch it, if for actors only.

Everything is form here - form is a type of action when there is too much of it, and people love action. Formalism is the term in visual arts. Or more plainly, it is fake - it is all package and wrapping - a consumer product like the macbook and the i phone. No doubt these people admire Steve Jobs."
" A curious insight into acting and vanity
",0.1027,0.9768,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Birdman' is an interesting film, but also a movie about a Broadway play - not the most invigorating subject. The concept of a former Comic Book Movie Star trying to re-start his acting career on Broadway is certainly unique, and the film has a great look - especially the way it's filmed to look almost as if it's one continuous shot. There's a few laughs, but this is definitely not a comedy.Keaton (Riggan) is great and ably supported by Stone (Sam, his daughter), Norton (Mike - happy to get around in underpants or his birthday suit for most of his scenes) & Watts (Lesley, his co-stars), although Galifianakis is a little wasted. Even though the cinematography is good, the fact it's basically one shot means there's a fair bit of wasted time as we follow characters down hallways. Probably could've been a 100min film, rather than two hours. The other thing I found annoying was the drum/cymbal fills - they're in his mind, but are very distracting.It's essentially about ego and the driving force behind actors. Sure, Riggan is a more delusional character than most actors (hopefully!), driven by his insecurity. As the critic says to him: ""you're not an actor - you're a celebrity"". Burn. The ending is, like the whole film, different, but not completely satisfying."

It's a reflection on meaning, parenthood, popularity, love, relationship and truth. But - most amazingly - it is exceptionally good at being all those things. Birdman is different than anything Inarritu has done before, and in a good way. Brilliantly conceived, brilliantly shot, brilliantly scored, brilliantly acted...just plain brilliant."

" Can't complain about anything; unequivocally deserved Best Picture
",0.7438,0.9642,2017-11-23 00:00:00,9,"This movie is unorthodox in so many ways, but it works so brilliantly. From the random drum beats in the credits to the levitation and telekinesis, you will be confused and entertained. The writing/dialogue is excellent, accompanied by awesome performances by Michael Keaton (the original Batman), Ed Norton and the others. Also, if you had any questions about the title, watch the movie and you'll understand. Keaton plays a sort of veteran actor in a world full of real celebrities (Clooney, Renner, etc.) where he is desperate to get his career back on track by performing in a play involving love and cheating and the like. He is haunted by the inner voice of his past self (as Birdman), who insults and enrages him on multiple occasions. This inner voice, even though Riggan (Keaton's character) hates it, motivates him to get up from his low points in the film (e.g. sleeping on some stairs using a plastic bag as a pillow after drinking a pint of whiskey). The voice also makes him hallucinate about returning to Birdman (you'll see what happens). Keaton also puts conviction into these frustrated moments, whether it's towards life or someone else (like Norton's character, Mike or Tabitha, a reviewer, whom he hates). He portrays the struggling actor very well (earning him a Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination, both deserved) with enough raw emotion to be realistic, but not melodramatic. Norton (how this man has not won an Oscar in his career is insane) also fits his role as Mike amazingly - an egomaniac who doesn't want anyone to control him. He does and says so many weird and out-of-the-blue things, but they add to the character, showing you why the other cast members hate him. Granted, Mike is a good actor, but he's uncontrollable. He gets beaten up by Riggan for stealing a spot in the NYT, where Riggan convincingly proves his acting ability. Mike also teaches Riggan about some parts of life (like Riggan's internal voice) and almost embodies cynicism. Emma Stone (Best Supporting Actress nomination for this, which is fair) also works unexpectedly (given she typically plays friendly characters) well as his estranged, drug-addicted daughter who, like Mike, lashes out at Riggan about him being a poor father and how low she believes his life currently is. The camera work is also very crafty, appropriately using slow transitions and rapid swings, mainly between characters. Riggan flying and moving stuff around with his mind is fun to watch. It was great to see Zach Galifianakis get away from his usual light comedic roles and, like the others, swear, be angry and uptight as Riggan's mate and produce. Also, low budget. Yes. I really cannot think of anything to call poor; I just think that some may not like its unorthodox nature."
" One long and technically marvelous take to show us a man's path to redemption, while adding satiric and black comedy elements
",0.7506,0.9621,2017-11-21 00:00:00,10,"A man searching for success and meaning when youth, wealth and fame have already turned his back on him, and the fact that he's had a pretty messy life (a divorce, a daughter whom he has always ignored and neglected, and is now dealing with drug addiction and overall unhappiness) doesn't help his situation. But he, Riggan Thomson, the once renowned Birdman, looks for a way to redeem himself from the failures of his past, and to get rid of the voice in his head (Birdman himself, taunting Riggan from the depths of his subconscious, messing with his sanity) by adapting Raymond Carver's ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" into a Broadway play, on which he is putting heart and soul to get right, facing unstable actors, his own deteriorating sanity and poor relationship with those around him, and a vile critic determined to ruin his name by slandering him and his play. All this shown through one (of course heavily edited and composited but nonetheless very convincing) long take, that acts both as an astounding technical achievement and a way to showcase the vertigo and overall feeling of movement and momentum that the story has, while making the story as grounded and realistic as possible, because life itself is one continuous long take that does not stop until you die (like our main protagonist, but it's entirely up to you if that's true or not).Why be happy with being a philistine when you can enjoy ""artsy fartsy"" movies without being a complete snob? Oh, that's right, because I revel in my ignorance, and any movie that takes me out of that comfort zone is ""pretentious"", ""self indulgent"" and ""artsy fartsy"", and I wouldn't touch that stuff with a ten foot pole, because I love being rewarded and hate having my expectations be subverted. Or at least that's what I heard some critics say over here. Even bratty children make temper tantrums less annoying than the ""criticism"" that I've heard for this film. Forget the beautiful and elaborate cinematography (people take everything for granted these days and don't think about the effort and passion that went into it, or how it complements the story, just ""muh motion sickness""), the time this film takes to develop characters and the overall plot (""because my friend fell asleep watching this"", hate to break it to you, but just because some people aren't able to appreciate pacing and character development, doesn't mean it isn't there), or the underlying themes and what it has to say about the industry (be it film, theatre, or any other art form for that matter). Just discard it, because regular people feel attacked or somehow poked fun at. Guess what, self proclaimed ""philistines"": Facts don't care about your feelings. And this is a superbly made, directed, acted, shot, written and thought out film. That's a fact. You can whine or screech in mediocre confusion all you want, or call it ""artsy fartsy"" (instead of trying to appreciate what you're seeing), but it won't change the fact that this is a revolutionary film that will go down as one of the greatest of moving picture history. And I don't even care if it already won Oscars or not, because a film can be revolutionary and influential without being recognized by ""the academy"", and both cinematographer and director (Luzbeki and Iñarritu) have had very influential and groundbreaking work (Children of Men on Luzbeki's part, and Babel on Iñarritu's, although the latter was nominated, but lost to Scorsese's The Departed, which was another great piece of cinema, and Scorsese was coincidentally another superb filmmaker not recognized by the academy up until that point) that has been overlooked or not received the praise it really deserves."
" A virtual theatrical experience
",0.0,0.9738,2017-10-30 00:00:00,10,"Every now and then a film will perfectly illustrate an art form not yet showcased on screen. For example, Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan for dancers or Damien Chazelle's Whiplash for musicians, and now Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman for actors. The seamlessly visceral one-take wonder is what made this project immediately a unique experience. Now, of course, there are obvious spots that do suggests cuts have been made but it never detaches you from the action. It flows fluidly, always shifting gears at every corner, making this an organic and lively watch, almost as if you were witnessing a theatrical performance. We begin with our lead character Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, levitating off the ground in his dressing room in a meditative pose. This already suggests it isn't going to be an ordinary flick with formulaic characters. From there, the camera weaves along, flowing from scene to scene aqueously without any pause as the score presents itself in the form of beats, as if the drummer was improvising the whole picture. Each character is then presented, as wacky and fresh as the next, perfectly acted from a star studded cast, in particular Edward Norton who steals almost every scene. But let me make this clear, this is Michael Keaton's movie, almost in a literal sense, playing an aged out actor who once was a Hollywood star that donned the famous Birdman suit (Can you see the correlation here?) Now, no longer a household name and only remembered by an older generation, he tries to make a comeback in a bold way, by adapting, directing and performing in his own stage production that could break the chains and make him into the artist he's always aspired to be. Keaton puts on a mesmerising performance that is as moving as Inurratu's camera-work, showing a plethora of emotions that will encapsulate your own. This movie serves up everything you'd want out of it in a silver platter. It is groundbreaking, almost to the point of being pure magic. It's a theatrical moving picture that reinvents the definition of cinema and why we need it so much."
" A Masterful Original
",0.3182,0.9217,2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie was an interesting story that blended art and reality together in a weird, yet realistic way. Parts of the movie felt a little disconnected from the audience (i.e. Birdman's unrealistic powers), but for some reason that disconnection left us feeling like we craved a deeper connection. And even though we couldn't relate to a superhero, we could relate to his very real life and the events in it. The movie takes its viewer on an emotional roller coaster as each scene further drives and intensifies the plot. I feel like there is a lot to learn from this movie and will definitely be re-watching it as I continually study the art of film."
" Good picture, not best picture
",-0.12,0.995,2017-10-08 00:00:00,8,"This is another movie that supports the argument that Hollywood loves movies about itself. I don't like to think that this myth is true, but 2014 was an amazing year for movies and Birdman was not the best one that came out. It's definitely good in a lot of ways and is much different from the rest of Alejandro Inarritu's work. I wasn't thrilled with it as a whole piece. It was cohesive and everything, but there wasn't a whole lot of cause and effect going on. That may be a little nit-picky, but I think if you went scene by scene and asked ""why does this scene have to happen now?"" there would be a few scenes that you wouldn't be able to give a substantial answer for. On the other hand, I enjoyed watching it for a lot of reasons. It was genuinely funny at several points. The chaotic drums in the background added a lot too. The dialogue was subtly impressive, advancing each scene while sounding very natural. It certainly helped that there were a lot of great actors to play each part. Riggan was an interesting and strangely accessible character that is struggling a lot with his self-confidence.The choice to make almost the entire movie a continuous tracking shot was good in some ways, and detracted in others. Part of the issue was that cut away a few times. Cutting away was good in that it drew attention to what went on in those couple moments, but it tarnished the novelty of the one-take. In a way, the movie was enhanced by the continuous shot because it reflected the world and made it feel a little more real at times. There were a few points, particularly during transitional moments like when it flashed from night to morning, where I felt like they were forcing the continuous take. This also made it a little more irksome when the take was broken. Maybe it's fitting that this particular movie was trying a little too hard to be something that it's not.As I implied at the beginning, I don't think this deserved to win best picture and don't consider it a must-see. It is an artsy but good movie that can be enjoyed by people who aren't into the performing arts. Still, those who are inclined toward creative pursuits will probably enjoy this more than those who don't, or will at least have stronger opinions about it. Overall Rating: 7.9/10"

" Very fantastic.
",0.5984,0.9811,2017-09-21 00:00:00,10,"Birdman (2014) is one of my favourite movies in the last 5 years. It is an ambitious film that shines due to its fantastic cast, score and crew. The director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, really caught my attention with this movie and I'll have to watch more of his work in the future. The plot of the movie depicts an actor (Michael Keaton) who used to play a superhero but quit to pursue a career on stage. He has written a play that he hopes could put his name back on the map and the film depicts his struggles with bringing it all together. As well as this he suffers from a schizophrenic-esque problem that gives him continuous grief at crucial moments. All this sets up for a decent movie, but what really makes it special, and I'm sure anyone who has seen it will know what I'm about to say, is the way it is shot. The whole movie is filmed and edited so that it seems as though it is one continuous shot, no cuts, like a play. There are obviously cuts in places but you have to look for them to find them. There are scenes that go on for nearly 10 minutes without any cuts which are really impressive once you start to consider how difficult it would be to maneuver the crew and all their equipment as well as the actors not messing up once. The amount of effort put into this movie is very encouraging for the future of cinema and is a really refreshing watch. Another good part is the score, which is just a continuous drumbeat which really keeps you on edge the entire time. Anyway, would I recommend this movie? Of course. I would say this is a must see and so far my favourite movie that I have reviewed. It's not just a film, it's an art piece and if you don't particularly like film or appreciate it, this should change your mind. I'm giving it a 10/10."

Quite how this crap won not one, not two, not three... but FOUR Oscars is beyond me. I hated it, everything from the pretentious script and the boring story to the nauseating camera-work and that never ending, highly irritating drum kit soundtrack, which I can still hear playing in my head now.Michael Keaton and the rest of this star-studded cast provide the only positive to speak of. The acting in 'Birdman' is very good and Keaton delivers a strong lead, it's just a pity that such a good performance is wasted in such a dreadful film. Anybody expecting a comedy, by the way, is in for a shock when they discover that the entire two hours is entirely laugh free. This is, in my opinion, one of 2014's worst films... four Oscars my arse."

Lubezki's camera work is impressive and a marvel. But after 30 minutes, we get the point, and there needs to be a good story too. Okay, so the story is a washed up actor on his last legs of sanity desperately trying to salvage whatever's left of his career, but at a point it becomes arduous to sit through. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. If it wasn't for the single take camera-work I don't think it would've gotten any praise or awards. Keaton is an 80s guy (gives a great performance in this by the way, award worthy, ironically), and this movie, if released in the 80s would have got 1 star, 2 max.the acting is great, but it's a painful, taxing watch that leaves you with ambivalence, at best, at the end.

Was this film even edited? The writing was just terrible, lost in translation of what was going on between dialogue and dizzy camera work. The majority of this blame goes to the director Alejandro González Iñárritu, of whom I just loved his directing in The Revenant. But I guess you can only do so much with a weak script.I should have given this film a 1/10, but it got a 3 only for the stellar performances by Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton and Andrea Riseborough.3/10, so it's a No from me."

This is a beautifully directed film by Alejandro and the script is so good and the chacters so interesting that talking scenes are just as investing and exciting as any action sequence.

Although, from personal opinion, a little over-hyped, 'Birdman' ('Gone Girl', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'Whiplash' were also personal favourites, and 'Boyhood' was also better than given credit for considering the amount of hate it's garnered) was a 2014 highlight and a worthy Best Picture winner.Not everything in 'Birdman' works. Some of the pace is a touch frenetic in parts of the second half and not everything feels quite as tied up as ought with things left a little loose.However, 'Birdman' is an exceptionally well made film, with some of the best and cleverest cinematography of the year, some of the cinematography and editing is so dazzling it's enough to take the breath away. The special effects are also tremendous. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (in the first of his deserved director wins, the best being 2015's 'The Revenant), 'Birdman' is one of the best directed films of 2014 too and shows Iñárritu's immense talent as a director, with breath-taking vision, sense of mood and the ability to make the story as gripping as possible.The script is fun, thought-provoking and at times touchingly profound. The story mostly, while sometimes thin, is gripping and the characters engage.Michael Keaton gives his best performance in years, an outstanding performance and perhaps a career-best. Edward Norton is similarly superb, his performance also ranking among his best. Emma Stones charms and delights too.Overall, very much divisive, with some people adoring or admiring it and others hating it, personally was one of the people who loved it while acknowledging its imperfections. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
" Birdman or (Implosion of Popularity)
",0.0,0.8987,2017-06-09 00:00:00,8,"Riggan doesn't need to be nice, he has a job to do, and he's going to do it the best he can, and his best isn't good in the first place.Riggan survives a career as Birdman, not too unlike Michael Keaton through the Batman series. And now he's trying to come back with a rendition of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love(unlike keaton, unless you could consider the making of this movie the comeback for him).Riggan is chasing his dream, the peaks he's stood. But in his pursuit every life choice he's neglected compounds on his psyche, tearing down his down his delusions of who he is. And he's mean, because nothing matters to him anymore, Riggan is driven to success, effectively making the film a satire of stardom and the transience of popularity. The very music that plays during the entirety is alive with popping percussion that goes in one and hatches out the other, it becomes a product of the moment, the same goes for the acting. Keaton's acting and the other actors' and actresses' feels real, it occurs in the second it happens. Making each moment come in for a moment and subsequently disappear forever(or until you watch the thing again).Riggan's journey is not a happy one, right for a man who gazes only at the past while presiding in the present. And you might be surprised with the fact that Riggan believes his half-baked attempt would dredge him up from the bottom of the modern swamp of popularity, but when the reflection is so ugly, sometimes you can't help but look away."
" Awful
",-0.4588,0.9238,2017-05-21 00:00:00,1,"I absolutely hated this film. It was so far up its own wazoo, it rightly almost disappeared from sight.I admit, that I had gone into the cinema to see this with erroneous preconceptions of what the film was about. I had expected something with action, but what I got was dramatic inaction. Yes, it was very clever, and ever so smug with its lovey-in-jokes (that industry insiders would appreciate). But the mood was dark, and the atmosphere was depressing. I go to the cinema to be entertained. That wasn't very entertaining at all. The portrayal of a man losing it, was very good, but the whole performance and sets seemed and felt claustrophobic. Sorry. I truly detested this film. Mind you, my identical twin (yes, really) loved it."
" Might be the worst movie i have ever seen
",-0.6249,0.7845,2017-05-19 00:00:00,1,"and that is saying a lot since i have seen every movie. Where to start.. It was boring, drawn out, and made no sense.....But that is Hollywood for you, with their artsy-fartsy nonsense that somehow wins best picture...It was NOT the best picture, far from it...but Hollywood being politically correct."
" Emotionally Volatile and Bizarre Masterpiece...
",-0.3182,0.9975,2017-05-08 00:00:00,9,"Either ""Birdman"" is too simple but tries to make its nervous directing and real-time editing pass for intellectual complexity or if it really flies over these considerations with the insolent confidence of a real birdman. Well, I'm not sure the film is as original as it intended to be, but the treatment is one of a kind and maybe one of these cases where the form and the content redeem each other and contribute to one of these puzzling experiences that look too good not to be intentionally made to impress you, yet the result is so efficient that you almost feel guilty to fall for it.Again, Inarritu displays some infuriating wizardry, using long takes and transitions from scene to scene, that are nonexistent so that in the end, you have the confusing impression to have endured in less than two hours, a dizzying and mind-bending three-day journey swinging between arguments, confessions, improvisations, outbursts of anger, passions, feelings, reconciliations etc. It is noisy, talkative, the drum beats popping up here and there highlight the torments that can invade an individual's mind like so many hits in the head, but, say what you want about ""Birdman"", the movie is alive and full of characters with a purpose that goes beyond the simple story-line. Well theoretically, they're all present for the release of an adaptation of Raymond Carver's play, but they're also free electrons moved by their own instinct, pasts and personal issues.They all have a particular endeavor and they're all tormented enough to pull the blanket in their side when they feel the need. The result is confusing but somewhat exhilarating and that everyone stays dedicated to the play allows the film to keep its common thread, so this mess has a reason to be, and to happen. And there's the central pillar, Michael Keaton as Riggan Thompson: the has-been star. Riggan is an alter-ego of Keaton that fools no one, Keaton ensured the transition between the 80's and 90's with his portrayal of Batman, but only to sink into relative oblivion after Burton's ""Batman"" movies have been relegated to the status of their corny 60's counterpart by Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale. This is not just Riggan but Keaton's comeback and the similarities are so vivid that the performance was probably harder, because it really takes courage to laugh at yourself.Thankfully, the film isn't devoid from a sense of humor in its constant meta-referential take on showbiz; even actors find the strength to laugh at themselves, like Edward Norton playing Mike Shiner, a very difficult and volatile method actor who's a ticking bomb of unpredictability. Besides Mike Shiner, there's Riggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone) who just came from rehab and tries to rebuild her relationship with her Dad, there's his ex-wife (Amy Ryan), a Broadway debutante (Naomi Watts) and the manager (Zach Galifianakis), all these people gravitate around Riggan, who's like the ringmaster and the player of his own bizarre show, trying to find himself while he's not even sure to be worth whatever his conception is, constantly invaded by the voice of ""Birdman"", like a phoenix awaiting to resurrect from the ashes of the past. The conflict is between Riggan's past and future and structures the film's present made of an attempt to conquer pride and self-esteem.And it's quite impressive that, in this existential swirl, the film had time to make parallels between Riggan's struggles and the obsessions of going viral, dictated by society and affecting the youth. Speaking of celebrities, there is an important scene, Riggan meets respected critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) who's like a theater 'Pauline Kael', she doesn't take him as an actor but a celebrity, a media phenomenon, a fraud who tries to steal some prestige, he tells her that all she does is labeling things, giving sterile epithets to hide out the fact that she didn't nothing in her life, they're both part of the same hypocrisy but no one deserves resentment who tries at least to stake his life and do something about it, any Youtube commentator could get a taste of Riggan's rant. Yet these comments are relevant because everyone seeks approval and popularity.I guess what ""Birdman"" shows is that we're all driven by opposite forces, one that tells you what you're really worth, or that you're a God, or a bum, it's all about perceived, real and felt value, and how we can express any of them. The film is an eye-opening experience about people's inner needs to be accepted, but it's more about reaching the kind of state where a man can master his being and control himself in order to accomplish what he feels he's meant to do. Maybe unconsciously, but it borrows a lot from another stage-themed film about aging, John Cassavetes' underrated ""Opening Night"" where Gena Rowlands played a character in conflict with her self-perception and yet wanted to make her performance worthwhile for the audience as if the people in the theater were the incarnation of life. There might that idea that there's something in theater that encompasses life, as there are many moments where the line between reality and fantasy gets confusingly thin..Were these bits pretentious? Well, I don't think one's work wouldn't reflect part of his ego and maybe what we take from pretentiousness is the strong presence of a man's personal vision in his work. In that case, this is a real masterwork, and a dazzling drum-beat driven journey that feels like a good companion to ""Whiplash"", a co-nominee of the same year. ""Birdman"" took the Oscar home, maybe because it wasn't as linear as ""Whiplash"", it tried to go beyond the limits of imagination, or because it fooled the Academy, but maybe the talent it takes to fool the audience deserves an Oscar after all, maybe, it's all about fooling people as long as you don't make them look like fools."
" Trying to break the mould. (Great film)
",0.0,0.4786,2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"I've just watched this film and thought it was beautiful and ambitious. However, upon looking at the reviews on this page I can't quite believe how ridiculous they are and how simple minded some of the other viewers must be.Not every film had to be full of action, perhaps the negative reviewers would be better off watching a film like The Avengers or Fast and Furious. Yes, this film is slow, but the pace builds and all the while we're treated to ambitious camera work and moments of charm from both actors and locations. The long flowing shots don't give you time to rest from whats happening on screen and portrays a frantic sequence of events to show the fast pace and stress of what Keeton's character is going through.The ending is somewhat vague, another reason why audiences may not enjoy this film, because in todays cinema most people sadly have to be spoon fed and told how to feel, rather than making their own conclusions. If you like your films with more depth than the typical drama or to try and achieve something greater than just confining to what people are used to, watch this. Perhaps this is more a film for film enthusiasts, appreciators and filmmakers than just anyone that wants to kill a few hours, because if you can't appreciate what this film achieved then I strongly recommend sticking to films with car chases and bad guys.This film was awesome."
" Different
",0.0,-0.4623,2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,"The very large majority of the film was bland. The screenplay was great, the dialogue was pretty good and the music perfect for such a film but it was the same thing over and over. A problem, Riggan realizing he's irrelevant, his inner self saying he can be if he tries. That's what I got from it myself at least. That is until the very end *SPOILER ALERT* he pulls out the gun. Most movies build up tension very gradually. Movies like King's Speech and Doubt do it very well. King's Speech does it countless times and bursts the bubble in a very satisfying manner. Doubt does it by building it up very slowly. The scene where Sister Aloysius Beauvier and Father Brendan Flynn are fighting lasts 12 whole minutes. This is where Birdman comes in place. Tension is rarely ever built until one of the last scenes. And not in a gradual and nice way but very suddenly and unexpected. I haven't seen a film that made my heart beat so fast in a long while. The tension was surreal. The way they played it off is a bit ridiculous but not disappointing. Definitely worth a watch."

The long shots blend into each other, when combined with the amazing acting it make it feel like you are watching an actual theater piece. To me, the movie is about the subjectivity of perception and the price one pays to change that of another. Alejandro addresses the ambiguity that arise as a result of the subjective nature of perception in multiple ways, through the direct narrative where Riggan has to deal with the ambiguity of his own thoughts and desires as well as that stemming from others. Finally, he puts the viewer through the same dilemma. Did Riggan die the first time he jumped off the building? did he blow his nose off and live to see another day? or did he fly away from the hospital like an avenger? I guess the answer depends on who you're asking, therein lies greatest beauty of the movie. 10/10 for me sir."
" Not everyone's cup of tea
",0.0,0.9976,2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Let me first say that the first time I watched Birdman I hated it and gave it a low rating on IMDb. However something didn't feel right and I felt I missed something. I watched it now a second time and have to say Birdman is a great movie. It is very well made and very distinctive but at the same time relatable. The film is about a faded actor whose best years are behind him and who seeks to make in Broadway on a different medium, theater. We get a unique and messy behind the scenes view of the dramas that come with hiring acclaimed actors and those close to you. However despite all these dramas the biggest fight is with himself, he has risked everything financially, professionally and personally. Michael Keaton proves his character and ironically himself as an actor are more than relevant with a great performance. The camera work, angles and shots were masterful. I love how the camera moves so loosely with the actors backstage to capture their intensity as it swerves left and right. The passage of time is done well as we effortlessly go from scene to scene. The unusual presence of drums also works well. The use of Birdman, his alter ego, represents his ambitions and visions of grandeur. Since he achieved great success in the past with Birdman, Birdman is a personification of his dream of success and greatness in his new venture. This is an unprecedented and great use of this alter ego in film and in my opinion the strongest part of the film. In reality we each have a Birdman of our own that represents our dreams of big and great achievement. The presence of superheroes in the film towards the end and the man of steel poster in the background outline the presence of superheroes. This why his Birdman worked so well because it was Michael Keaton's Birdman and with it he was a superhero who could fly. This prompts him to channel and 'listen' to Birdman when he goes all the way using a real gun. Just like the student, worker or sportsman goes out of their way and takes a leap when they are invested in their work so does Michael Keaton's actor in his final scene. I understand a number of people and their reviews attack Birdman but they may want to watch it again. The issue for most, including me, was people had a traditional mindset of film. They are used to classics that told coherent and structured stories but if you watch it with a different lens and see where it takes you you might change your vote. I adopted a different lens and appreciated it. There is definitely something to see in this film. It is not a piece of rubbish like Moonlight that asks to see something when nothing is there. To those who are confused with the end it's really not too hard. It was evident when Birdman was channelled in the film because we saw his alter ego Birdman and heard music. The scene where he flies to the theater is a good example because we see a cab driver running after him and can assume he took a cab all along. The same happens in the final scene. Notice that Emma Stone only looks temporarily at the ground before gazing upwards, normally everyone would look below. The purpose was she finally saw her father soar and fly and become a superhero of his own."
" The best film of 2014
",0.6369,0.9961,2017-03-31 00:00:00,10,"Birdman (Or the Unexpected virtue of Ignorance) is the best film I have seen from 2014. Never before have I seen a film present the characters in such a raw, dynamic and fluid way, with performances from Keatan, Stone, and Norton that are nothing short of astounding. I prefer not to use statements like these when I talk about movies but this one manages to impress me enough to deserve it- this is a perfect movie.To start of the way this film is shot is awe-inspiring in itself. Birdman is presented as if it is all in one shot, no dissimilar to the Carver play that Riggan Thompson (A washed-up middle aged actor who used to play a superhero,) is adapting. While the film clearly isn't actually in one take, like the German heist film Victoria, the transitions between these hyper-coordinated scenes are incredibly well done, to a point where it doesn't even feel like the shot has ended, and the fantastic framing and beautifully fluid nature of these shots is incredibly effective. It gives the film a feel of an amazingly well timed, hyper-coordinated dance between the actors and it's integral to the atmosphere and the progressively tightening tension of the movie.I mentioned before that the cinematography of this film relates to the play that the main character is adapting and directing, but this is not the only meta theatrical element of the play. Another element of meta theatricality is seen when Riggan and Mike are walking to the bar after a disastrous preview, and we see the movie's score being played by a street performer. This happens again later in the movie as the main character begins to descend into madness and the tone becomes more surrealist, and it's elements like this that show how meticulously choreographed and timed this film is. It is rare that I can say a movie deserves the academy awards it receives, but if anything this movie deserves even more accolades than it already has, and it's refreshing to see the Oscar for best picture go to a film that truly deserves such a title. To me this is a shining example of a 10/10 movie and if you haven't yet seen it I can't recommend it enough."
" Notable for being one of the biggest waste of time movies ever
",-0.4215,0.9873,2017-03-27 00:00:00,1,"I eagerly rented this movie since I'm a lover of Michael Keaton offerings and there were Academy Award nominations plus a frenzy of Hollywood Elite praises for this thing.Wow! What a disappointment! I suppose I can understand why the Hollywood folks would like it since it was basically a close-up look at what it's like to be producing a play, something most actors have been involved with. But this is not something that interests me. There were early glimpses of Birdman's super-powers and this was the hook that enabled me to nurse some hope that it would be entertaining. But this remained only hinted at during the first hour and it became clear that we were going down the path of watching a theatrical endeavor going off the rails. Ho hum!I actually invested almost an hour watching this abomination hoping, just like the guy who is certain that the turnoff is going to be right past the next rise, that things were going to turn around and it would actually be watchable...... it had such promise! Never happened. I now pray that a merciful god will grant me an extra hour at the end of my life to make up for the time I wasted watching this, this.... this thing. But to be fair, perhaps things got better after I made the life affirming decision to do ANYTHING else. So maybe it DID turn around and redeem itself. I'm just not willing to spend that much time being bored out of my mind."
" How Did They Do That?
",0.0,0.9972,2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) follows a washed up Hollywood actor who ends up in Broadway, writing, directing and acting in a play, all the while dealing with his family problems and his deteriorating mental state. Michael Keaton gives an amazing performance here. He sells himself to this character 100%, and it pays off beautifully. He really gives off the impression that he as a person is where his character is at. As for the supporting cast, Emma Stone is fantastic, though I wish she was in the movie a little more. Edward Norton is similar to Keaton, as in he's fantastic. While he isn't quite as good, he's still stunning to watch. His performance here is Oscar-worthy, no doubt. Zach Galifianakis and Naomi Watts both give great performances here too. Everyone is great, let's just leave it at that. The writing is fantastic. The characters are authentic and interesting, and the way the plot progresses is just the same. It's exactly where it should have been, and there's no better way this movie could've gone. And of course the directing is outstanding. There are so many moments of 'how did they do that?' How is it that Alejandro G. Iñárritu pulled off each of these shots? And where would you make a cut? I had so many questions, but they were more in awe than in frustration. The soundtrack is great. It's largely composed of drums, and it's a pleasure to listen to. And still it doesn't end there. The soundtrack is used at specific points to show what's going on in the main character's head. It's used to further represent and give the audience an idea of where he is mentally speaking. Overall Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is stunning. It's a combination of great acting, great writing, great directing, and a great soundtrack bunched up together into one giant ball of perfection. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this wonderful piece of art."

" Birdman
",0.0,0.9971,2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"This film tells the story of an over-the-hill actor called Riggan Thomson (brilliantly portrayed by Michael Keaton) who was once the star of a superhero blockbuster franchise known as 'Birdman'. We are shown his journey into making a Broadway production starting with the initial rehearsals and read-throughs. What follows is a brilliant exploration of celebrity culture in an intriguing and satirical way.'Birdman' could essentially be looked at as one continuous long shot. The camera constantly weaves around the actors and action and so the audience are completely immersed into the perspectives of the various characters (mostly Riggan's). The opening shot plays like a scene in Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' as it delightfully establishes the narrative in a fluid and polished style whilst introducing the cast and their entertaining interchanges during a rehearsal with hilarious consequences.The editing throughout the picture is almost flawless when moving from scene to scene and has a dizzying effect much like Gasper Noé's 'Irreversible'. 'Birdman' also boasts some marvellous special effects throughout such as when Riggan (Keaton) is alone and being taunted by his egotistical alter-ego. The film shows up typical blockbuster action movies by asking the audience what they want and giving it to them in a manner which embraces the excitement and epic-ness of the genre whilst also poking fun of the conventions.The music that accompanies the film is very scarce in a lot of places adding emphasis to the dialogue and situations arising but, in some cases, an erratic and improvisational drum riff can be heard (occasionally accompanied with the drummer on the set) which completely adds to the eccentricity and spontaneity of the movie.The screenplay is very intricately written and contains many profound philosophical speeches about art, celebrity and criticism. There are monologues and debates by characters in which they discuss the core beliefs of the film such as Riggan's speech during his performance of his Raymond Carver play ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"".The whole narrative of the film is very intriguing and interesting. There is a perfect blend of comedy and poignancy. There are a lot of twists and ambiguity throughout the film which could be analysed and interpreted for a long time.Michael Keaton is fantastic as the protagonist and gives a performance that would have given his career a huge revival (his squeal is my highlight of the film). The parallels with the character's career and that of Keaton's could not have been a mistake and gives the performance that much more edge. Edward Norton plays the method actor from hell (Mike Shiner). He is annoying, snobbish and smug and played brilliantly by Norton who excels in the vileness and pomposity of the character.The film is very much about actors. The self obsessive nature of acting is definitely highlighted by the two central performances but there is also a cast that really help to deliver the film's meaning such as Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts.Overall, 'Birdman' is a fantastic film. It is filled with pathos and profound imagery whilst keeping the viewer thoroughly entertained throughout. I feel it thoroughly deserves all of the award nominations that it is receiving and my final rating is an average of 4.5 stars."
" Novel style of film making from Alejandro G. Iñárrítu - masterpiece
",0.7506,0.9933,2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Scanning the reviews, I have seen a horrible representation of what this film is. It is no surprise that there are perhaps 8 out of 10 reviews that post a 1 star rating (which stands for 'terrible - do not ever watch!'), and I vehemently disagree with that position. When you look at the breakdown of the 1 star rating for this film, it accounts for just 2% of the audience, so by no means is that 1 star rating an accurate portrayal of the brilliance of this novel, artistically styled film.After having seen the Revenant, and now this, I have to say that Alejandro G. Iñárrítu is now my favorite director out there. There is something about his films that has me absolutely glued to the screen, and wanting more. I very often, in a long movie, eventually find myself drifting and moving about uncomfortably at some points in the film, however, I have noticed that the end of the film comes long before I realize, even though the films are quite lengthy. His incredible way of telling a story is indeed masterful, he draws you into the story and you essentially become a part of the plot line.Not only that, but as the audience, you feel an innate feeling where you are questioning things for the central characters, and there is a strong sense that you are a part of the action on screen. His films are strong with ambiance and emotion, and I will say this here, he is not afraid to try new things, and for that I commend the work of this brilliant director for breaking the norms and trying something different and new.The style used in this film, has very little editing. In fact, a lot of the sequences go on for 5 to 10 minutes, it is one heck of an accomplishment and brilliantly done. Similar to how our individual existences are - things don't cut in and out that way and this way in our realities, we are looking through a constant frame of reference, and as such, you become a very tight observer of the story-line.I noticed some have criticized this style of filming in the comments, as if it is done for ego and to amaze, but to me, they have missed the plot and the intention. Of course, not everyone will get it or understand it, but my advise is to simply ignore some of the negative comments around and to see it for yourself as is, and to come back and put the comments in the place they deserve. The same could be applied to a controversial artist appearing in town, there will be the critics who receive it negatively, but for a majority of folk that appreciate novel art, those critics are to be ignored, you need to see it for yourself to understand it. If you're looking for stock standard, formulaic films, then this film might not be what you're looking for, and there is plenty of that around so, next!This is not your stock standard Hollywood film template, and I think that Alejandro has a real gritty, ingenious take to movie making and I hope that he will be making many more. He has a unique angle that I believe will, in the decades to come, be appreciated as masterful.My last criticism is of reviewers giving a 1 star rating to a movie that is far from being an awful piece of rubbish. I don't think there are many movies out there that deserve that accolade. It is often slightly humorous that a movie that is so professionally polished, filled with top class actors and improvised sound pieces, could deserve such negativity from people that actually most likely took a liking to the film, appreciated the art and other aspects of the film, but probably reviled that the story line didn't have the sugar they wanted. That said, the ratings itself speaks volumes and those voices are trying hard to make a point that gets washed out from the true greatness of this amazing film.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
" Inarritu's best film since ""Babel""
",0.6369,0.988,2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a movie that is one of the most original movies that I have seen in this decade with a cast that literally knocks their performances out of the park in this movie and now that i'm writing this review I couldn't agree more that this was an Oscar worthy movie. The movie stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson a broke Broadway actor who is in the process of making a play called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" that is adapted from Raymond Carver. Thomson also wrote the script and directed the play and this his chance to make or break his career. Thomson is also having personal struggles he has a daughter named Sam (Emma Stone) who has at first a rocky relationship with him, and an ex-wife named Sylvia (Amy Ryan). During one of the rehearsal scenes of the play we see Riggan practice with co-stars such as an actress named Lesley (Naomi Watts) as well as two other actors and one of them he refers to as ""The worst actor he's ever seen."" who then gets injured. After the injury scene he talks with his attorney and his best friend named Jake (Zach Galifianakis) to find a replacement actor for the play. Within a few minutes they find an actor named Michael Shiner (Edward Norton). Another actress that I forget to mention that was in the play was an actress by the name of Laura (Andrea Riseborough).Like some of my other favorite filmmakers I have never seen such a style like Inarritu's when it comes to directing a movie in a long time even though with a lot of filmmakers like Spielberg, Scorsese, or Tarantino it's till there and that skill is to get to the point with any type of story, and believe me Inarritu's direction is excellent. During the movie the play went on to become a huge hit and resurrected Riggan's career as an actor. Even though this is a great movie that teaches people that when you are in a bad situation of any kind such as your career being in dire straits you can always redeem yourself and soar above your problems and be at the top of your game once again. This is one of the 10 best movies of 2014."

The cinematography here is flawless and the concept of it is pure genius.2. Every character here is a satire of themselves. Michael Keaton is a satire for his career, Edward Norton is a satire for his notorious behaviour off camera. It is pure genius to do it in this way. The story surrounding this movie is a satire for Michael Keaton's career and I love the movie for that. I think it it brave and genius and a testament to cinematic genius.3. All acting is flawless, from Michael Keaton to Edward Norton to even Zach Galiginakis. 4. The ending leaves you wanting more. Bad:1. The music could be a little off but that is a very minor flaw.10/10A Testament to cinematic excellence!"
" i dug my grave for Oscars....
",-0.3818,0.959,2017-02-10 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie yesterday and to be honest it was not that great.Now i understood this movie completely...it's a satiric drama.it calls superhero movies cultural genocides and later criticises critics....nice inarritu has himself proved this movie doesn't make any sense.anyone with a brain and knows movies know that the critics rate the least for comic book movies and rate high for art movies like this one.so yeah give it a thought he first states that comic book movies are worthless and thus becomes one among the critics...and then he criticises these critics...yeah thats it the man himself proved he is worthless.The guy deserves an applause for that.The genres comedy and romance should be deleted from the description...this movie did not have both...except for those so called brilliant persons who think having sex with a guy after two exchanges in a truth or dare game is romance...and usage of foul disgusting non sensical language as comedy.Inception,fight club,memento,strangelove....are much more thought provoking and interesting than this.Interstellar deserved to have the best picture nomination eliminating this and the award should have gone to any ten....not this movie.so with this movie i lost all my respect to Oscars and critics mostly..."
" Usual suspects but with a twist
",-0.1779,0.9549,2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Actor who used to be famous tries a comeback. This must be one of the oldest clichés in the book and indeed the story itself and character tick all the right boxes :Previous successful (in Batmanstyle blockbusters) actor with alcohol problem tries comeback (via the theater) : check. Teenage daughter on drugs : check. Slutty much younger girlfriend : check. Complaining but still caring ex-wife : check. Super nervous producer : check. Much younger annoying co-star trying to steal his lines (and his daughter) : check. Bitterold theater critic : check.And so on.I guess the director and producer knew this very well so they had the real bright idea to film in a series of long continuous shots with a minimum of editing and it works brilliantly. It has not been done since 1948 ""Rope"" (Hitchcock) which is rather strange as the current film technology makes this so much easier as then. And on that part alone the directing and best film Oscars were duly deserved !"

Someone says...""don't bother, not worth it"", I'll still go and often find I do enjoy it. With all the hype I'd heard about this, I went. I was especially excited to see Michael Keaton since I've always felt him to be a great and underrated actor of our generation. I'd recently seen Emma Stone in Cabaret and find her to be beautiful, talented, and just a pleasure to watch in anything. The icing on the cake, Edward Norton. ""American History X"", ""Primal Fear"". Need I say more. As far as I was concerned, the movie could actually be awful, and I'd just watch and enjoy these wonderful actors. I know I'm not alone, because MANY reviews on here have the same opinion as I do. Confusing, disjointed, WHAT is going on?, where is the story?, and what in hell is real and what is not? Obviously more than a lot of people love this movie. It did , after all win the Oscar for best motion picture. So, to each his own. I however stand in my opinion. It is the first and only movie in my memory that after 45 minutes into showing, I actually walked out on."
" This movie really flies
",0.0,0.982,2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"If you've never been in the acting field, you won't relate as well to this film or immensely enjoy it, that much more, in that respect. Has been actor, Riggan (Keaton, in what is obviously his best ever performance) once a action movie star, tries to reinvent himself with this new Broadway play. Riggan is an arrogant, selfish being. Me myself, an actor, has met a few of these people through my experiences. Two things, I related to, especially, was getting locked out once, where I kind of discreetly had to pound the door and church of this church hall to get back in. The other, especially, was the sour female critic character who hated Keaton, where me myself fell out with this leading castng director. This is the stuff that happens. Interfering and becoming a threat to Keaton, is a supporting actor (Norton) called at the last minute, replacing a former actor, who did himself injury. Keaton's daughter (Stone) starts up a relationship, first wowed by his stern, lean physique. He too, is one of these cocky, vain, types and Norton plays it well, although Stone impressed me better. This is the coming of an actress, who is just keeps getting better. The other performance I really liked, despite the strong female performances, from Keaton's wife and lover, was Galifinakis as Keaton's publicist, if I recall. It was just the other performance that stuck out here, while Watts, I really liked as Norton's ex lover. At least her character wasn't a selfish type, and was quite the reverse, and rather cute too. The comforting scene between her and and the other woman in the change room, I've seen many times too. Although I thought the dream sequences with Keaton flying, about the New York cityscape and streets kind of seemed stupid, they were beneficial to the story. As you know too, this movie, is a one camera following shot, and it works beautifully for this story. The end shot is kind an open ended tease, the only real qualm I had with this brilliant film, bolstered by great and intense performances. Strangely the mentioning of the Fawcett/Jackson deaths back in 2009, a day apart, was brought up by Keaton's character."
