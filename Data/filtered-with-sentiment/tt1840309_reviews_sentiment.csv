" Despite the sparse context and weak visuals, Divergent has fun with the good action scenes and with the gradual increase in the difficulty that Tris must face
",0.4939,0.9932,2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,"The world of Divergent is curious. In the opening minutes, Tris (Shailene Woodley) explains to the viewer that, in the not too distant future, the city of Chicago is destroyed and the residents were divided into factions, according to their qualities and choices: Selflessness, composed of altruists, current leaders; Dauntless, for the brave who act as policemen; Friendship, for the affectionate (and dressed like hippies); Candor, for those who speak only the truth; and Erudition, formed by intellectuals (and who may be plotting a coup d'Ã©tat).Those who do not fit into any of the groups become homeless. But at the age of 16, the destiny can be much worse: those who fall into more than one of the factions are called divergent, hunted, imprisoned and even killed. But how did this separation occur? Nobody protested at the beginning? What was there before the division? Why are these five factions, and not others? The division system accounts for professions such as farmers (Amity), lawyers (Erudite) and guards (Dauntless), but where are the doctors, the artists? What do those of Candor do? It is not known. Perhaps the book explains this social and historical context well, but the film does not provide explanations.Disobedience, then, is something that is expected of teenagers, like any rite of passage. A bestseller among young people, Divergent embraces in a painless and behaved way (the only real break in Beatrice's life is also expected and obligatory, farewell to parents) the idea that the world is a place to be physically explored. Extreme sports and games are at the heart of that experience in the film, and while there is a minimal sense of threat - deaths are considerably more shocking in The Hunger Games - it is inevitable to see the heroine's journey in this film as a ride through an amusement park.Evan Daugherty, newcomer who wrote the script for Snow White and the Hunter, adapted with Vanessa Taylor the futuristic plot that runs, in good measure, as an American high school story, varnishing the mandatory division of groups in the cafeteria (nerds, athletes, patricinhas etc. here they just change their name), with the right to flirt between one burger and another. The screenwriters little explore the relationships between their characters with themselves and between them, failing to get the basics, which is to give the audience reason to care about the fate of those figures. Even the initial premise of the franchise is used minimally and ends up being almost neglected in favor of a novel pushed down to the audience.Based on the success of The Hunger Games saga, it was only a matter of time before another plot appeared in the cinemas that referred to a dark and totalitarian future. However, Divergent is inferior in terms of the Katniss Everdeen saga in terms of visual effects and art direction. The Hunger Games presented a boldness for costumes and sets that the world of Tris does not dare to imagine. The futuristic scene in Chicago is very minimalist, as if the future did not bring many aesthetic changes in relation to the present (or as if art directors had a reduced budget to work). Abnegation residents are known for their vow of poverty, but the other factions have similarly simple clothes and visual identities. Perhaps the greatest example of little visual inventiveness is Jeanine Matthews' (Winslet) costume, which should represent power, authority and coolness, but looks just like any executive. However, what takes a little interest out of the film are some (dozens) of poor dialogues, which may not even need to be in the script.As for the plot itself, The Hunger Games removes the structure of young people who fight among themselves to select the strongest - to impose a logic of bread and circus, in the case of Katniss's story, and by self-imposition of the young people themselves, in the case of the violent internal rules of Dauntless. Both governments are tyrannical, but Divergent's seems more perverse, since the residents themselves have assimilated the rules and started to reproduce the logic of extermination on their own. As for the script, it's a shame that the surprising amount of twists and turns in Divergent ends up sacrificing tension. Important moments such as Dauntless tests, or Tris' aptitude test are revealed without any suspense, without scenes of anticipation. When the tests start, Tris is always one of the first to participate, enters the room quickly and does what she has to do. If he had more time or more attention to the pace, the director would be able to build a claustrophobic atmosphere - which The Hunger Games achieved most successfully in its gaming arena.The film loses a little of its potential when it does not free itself and the ordinary. The novel inserted in the story proves to be potentially distracting. The construction of the main character is interesting and the show is becoming strong and fearless, but the possibility of this being eclipsed by her relationship with the character Four is strong. Thus, the message loses power in the face of the romantic ending that the character may or may not have. The need to serve larger audiences is stronger than the message that it is possible to be different and that there is no mistake in that.Another failure was to structure the film in such a way that moments lost due importance. We see the character entering various situations of overcoming and challenging throughout the film, but the last challenges and overcoming are superficial and frivolous, not receiving much attention or even generating consequences for the character. In its struggle to free itself from the motto ""faction before the blood"" the film ends up taking the character away from the colon, in addition to simplistic resolutions at certain times and total detachment with characters and their deaths.Divergent has some advantages over the other franchises mentioned. There are many more scenes of action, combat, more blood and more training that Tris must go through. The script calmly accompanies the girl's improvement in the art of war - unlike Katniss, she has no innate talent before entering the ""games"", in this case, the training. The training pace is good, convincing, and Shailene Woodley is able to cope with the character's complexity, especially in times of tension, such as fear scenarios and knife testing. Director Neil Burger's camera constantly focuses on the actress's face, showing that the director knows where the biggest weight of the film resides. But, considering the violent universe in which Tris gets involved in choosing the Dauntless faction, Neil Burger's cowardice in showing the consequences of the training (and, later, of the military actions) perpetrated by the group, greatly minimizes the impact of these scenes. It is not about glorifying violence, but about showing more seriously its physical and emotional consequences, something that ""Hunger Games"", produced by the same Lionsgate / Summit has done so well. Some deaths that occur during the projection do not have the dramatic resonance that is required of them, because director Neil Burger seems to want to spare the audience any more uncomfortable emotions. Moments of tension, fear and excitement are present throughout the plot, but the often static camera dissolves part of what we should feel during these scenes, which then must only depend on the performance of the actors, who save at times.Overall, Neil Burger - the same as No Limits with Bradley Cooper - should be able to please fans and also those who are unaware of the books. Although not daring visually, limited to filming his characters up close and creating great aerial shots of the futuristic city (which reveal the limitation of special effects), Burger knew how to explore certain elements of the story, such as the half-destroyed city of Chicago, which it served to dictate the tone that the film needed. Neil still changed the end of the film a little, differentiating it from the original version (but not much) which ended up creating a very interesting outcome. The soundtrack, produced by none other than Hans Zimmer in partnership with Junkie XL and Ellie Goulding, is simply sensational and fits very well with all the scenes.Even so, Divergent has fun with the good action scenes and with the gradual increase in the difficulty that Tris must face. It is also worth highlighting the protagonist's simple and punctual romance with leader Four, without excessive love scenes. Despite the sparse context and weak visuals, the film managed to fulfill the two biggest challenges it faced: including as much of the story as possible in the script while maintaining its loyalty, to please the fans of the book, and explaining the minimal bases of the story, to those who still don't know the work of Veronica Roth. Despite having a slow pace (it's 2h20 of film), Divergent's script does not compromise by giving time for the story to be told smoothly (although a 15 or 20-minute edition would do the plot well). And, of course, there are hooks for the sequels, since the film is the first in a trilogy. The tip is to enter the room without waiting too long and leave satisfied after the session with a film that fulfills its goal: entertaining the audience. What is already more than could be imagined in a plot that, at first, seems to be a mixture of so many copies aimed at teenagers and launched on screens in recent years."
" Ashley Judd, Tony Goldwin, Zoe Kravitz, tops!
",0.5562,0.7948,2021-03-12 00:00:00,6,"This movie popped up on my YouTube tv. I never heard of it. I started watching it, when I saw Ashley Judd I was hooked! I love Ashley Judd and she did not disappoint in this movie.
I thought the character of Beatrice was written haphazardly. It seemed very odd that she joins dauntless when she has the habit of telling the truth to the point that it makes people uncomfortable. Her fearlessness about telling the truth follows her when she meets high-ranking officials / leaders of this dystopian setting.
That behavior is by definition a Candor ""they always tell the truth, even when you wish they wouldn't""
hello!
I just don't buy it that Beatrice would choose dauntless, or that she would be that confused about what to do with her life. Yeah I get it that she was impressed by them, because in a way they are impressive in a scary way. but nowhere in her life did she ever demonstrate the traits of a dauntless.
It's not believable that Beatrice/Tris would pass all the dauntless tests either. She's a kid, she is weak, her legs and arms are spindly. It's a set up for eyecandy is all it is, and that's why it loses a solid 4 stars. She is the center of attention, she's a main character, but without the support of ALL the other actors, she's not one bit believable as dauntless.
Tony Goldwin's character, he did an excellent job! Zoe Kravitz, wow! I want to keep seeing her, she did such an excellent portrayal of her character.
Kate Winslet was outstanding as leader. She was quite the politician, always careful to say the right thing to be on top, of course that's the writers, but her delivery was spot on. Did not miss a mark!
If I would've read the reviews before this movie popped up, I would never have seen this. It's PG-13 for a reason, and usually has to do with suggestive sex scenes, but this time, it's just the flat out gratuitous violence.
So I am disappointed that I watched it because now I'm kind of curious about the second and third installment, but I won't be watching them. I will read spoiler reviews to get the jist. I do not need to see those nasty violent scenes to be entertained.
That said, the fact that there is installment two and three, doesn't make sense to me. At the end when Tish and Four give Jeanine the serum and she stops the program and destroys it, in this suggestive state why didn't they make her write a suicide note with new instructions for the people, and kill herself?
Because they need installments two and three.
Whatever."

" An excellent film.
",0.5719,0.9963,2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"After the resounding success of ""Hunger Games"", American studios were hungry for more films and trilogies for young adults. ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"". In this film, the beginning of another trilogy, we are presented with a dystopian future: the human race faced the Third World War and almost died out.In order to regain peace, the survivors grouped in the city of Chicago and created factions, in which they engaged according to their vocation: Erudite grouped intellectuals, teachers and scientists; Amity did the same with farmers, manufacturers, artisans and traders; Candor includes magistrates, lawyers, bailiffs and lawmakers; Dauntless welcomed the police and military; the Abnegation brought together civil servants, doctors, nurses, social workers and all those who dedicate their lives to helping others. By their characteristics, they are also the political leaders. The faction is chosen in adolescence, after a vocational test that should help, or even indicate, to which faction you belong. There are also those who have no faction or have left theirs, and who live in misery. In a system where the faction is more relevant than family, being without a faction is being excluded from society.The young protagonist is Beatrice, or Tris, whom the vocation test indicated belonging to more than one faction, that is, being a Divergent, a serious threat to the faction system. Choosing to join the Dauntless, she will face serious difficulties to integrate and pass the tests presented to her. To make matters worse, her father, who is one of the leaders of the Abnegation, is being questioned by the strength of the Erudite, led by the cruel Jeannine, eager to rise to power, albeit by violence.I really liked the movie, overall. At the time it was released I felt it went quite unnoticed, overshadowed especially by ""Maze Runner"". Now that some years have passed and the success of the competitors has faded, it was interesting to see this film, I felt that I could appreciate it better and that the film has aged well until now. The story is good, it holds us to the end, and it develops in an engaging way.The cast is quite good and competent at what they should do. I especially liked Shailene Woodley, who I didn't know until I saw her here. She is good at what she does, she has talent and, on a more personal note, she is identical to an old flame of mine, which is almost the same age as her, and that of course made me remember my own past. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, where he seems cut out for the role. Miles Teller is just as good, especially considering that his character is hateful. Equally worthy of our hatred is the character of Jai Courtney, who is very good at the task of being rude, brutish and somewhat sadistic. Kate Winslet is cold and insensitive, and in fact she performed very well, but I don't know if I would bet on her as the first choice for the character. The film also features Zoe Kravitz, Ansel Elgort and Ashley Judd.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes, and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild all? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. I also liked to see Intrepid climb buildings with ease ... in a city that is famous for its strong winds (another logic problem that can only be forgiven for being less relevant). The sets and costumes were very well done and the soundtrack also fits into the overall set."

" A Fun Dystopian Drama But Not a Perfect Adaptation
",-0.4305,0.986,2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"In The Divergent by Veronica Ruth, Beatrice Prior is a teenager about to choose her place in the dystopian future of post-apocalyptic Chicago. There are five factions with their own ideas about why the future is shaped the way it is and what they would do to make sure it never happens again. The five factions are Dauntless, Abnegation, Erudite, Candor and Amity those who believe lack of courage, kindness, intelligence, fidelity, and peace in that very order was the problem. Each sixteen year old does a test to determine which faction they belong to. However some kids do not identify not with one faction but two or more and Beatrice Prior is one of those people. Beatrice had the choice between Erudite, Dauntless and Abnegation. When she keeps her Divergent identity a secret and leaves Abnegation for Dauntless that one move changed the moral development of her character.Now renamed Tris Prior because it is a more aggressive name then Beatrice, she knows that if she shows she is a devoted Dauntless person, it would make people very suspicious. She earned the respect of a lot of people at the Dauntless initiation due to her actions during the initiation training with a paintball style capture in the flag game. She showed her other two sides (Erudite and Abnegation) a lot during the game using her intelligence to look at the enemy team from an abandoned Ferris wheel and choosing a more passive approach towards her opponents. Her choice ultimately led her to change the way she acted long gone, when she was the tiny figure with no muscle, to a full blown adult with muscles who has mastered her fears. Her choice of Dauntless led her to have a loving relationship with Tobias Eaton because of which she had a leap towards adulthood out of her adolescence. While this was going on her relationship with Peter was a wicked one and overall helped her overcome her biggest challenge yet. Peter was seen as the antagonist in the story up to a point, Peter from the start was seen as very aggressive when fighting against people. Then a malicious occasion occurred as Peter stabbed a person in the eye above him in the dauntless rating - Edward, and in the process proceeds to make Edward Factionless - the people in poverty without a clan. If she does not finish high enough in the Dauntless rating Tris will become one of the Factionless which given her small size looked likely. Then she got attacked by Peter and a couple of his friends, which she only survived thanks to Tobias who is not only her instructor but also her love interest. When she goes through the fear test, the first time in a long time she was scared of showing she was a Divergent. Tris and Tobias go through the fear test once before doing the test for real, this is extremely important for Tris because it is the final test to join Dauntless. Tris does not mistakenly use her Erudite and Abnegation activities during the actual test. For example when she was stuck in a water tank about to lose oxygen she uses brute strength to break free instead of her intelligence, which if it did not matter, she would have had used. While Tris was passing the simulations, something was brewing that would change post apocalyptic Chicago forever. The tensions between the Erudite and the Abnegation were at an all time high because the Erudite were filled with greed and the abnegation were anything but greedy. Her choice of Dauntless changed the situation as a whole, making her aware of the attack on her former faction. This necessitated the banding together of people like Tobias, her father, mother, and son to help stop the Erudites. Which Tris could not do if she was still in Abnegation. In the end, Tris' father and mother sacrifices their lives because of their ultimate goal to make certain that Erudite not kill the Abnegation faction. It was a sacrifice made even sourer once Tris' brother admitted to making the brainwashing serum injected into the Dauntless faction to kill the Abnegation. This same brainwashing serum causes the death of more than half of the Abnegation faction. Without courageous Tris, they would have all died. To survive she had to finally find shelter with the Amity faction.
To conclude in The Divergent by Veronica Ruth, Tris Prior changed post apocalyptic Chicago by saving the Abnegation faction. In the process, she not only increased her already high confidence but also helped her transition to adulthood. She became a better stronger person because of it."

It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best."

I also liked Theo James, who portrays Four. A few of the others, like ZoÃ« Kravitz (Christina) and Miles Teller (Peter), are OK too. With that said, they are all let down by the aforementioned iffy dialogue.I rate the initial world building and all the different factions, though that's one of the (many) areas where I think this film could've been great - so much more can be done with that.

They could have chosen a better actress for the main character, Tris, because at times it feels like Shailene Woodley is not delivering the dialogue as she should be. Sometimes she sounds bored, and sometimes she overacts, but Kate Winslet portraying the evil leader of their post-apocalyptic world saves it because she's almost as creepy as Donald Sutherland's portrayal of President Snow in the Hunger Games. I enjoyed the subtle bits of humor sprinkled throughout what is otherwise a dark film. The first hour or so was a bit slow, but the third act was great. I was really enthralled by Hans Zimmers' score, and the electronica music inserted here and there, even though it makes no sense to have it there. I have never read the books (and don't plan to because I want to be surprised) but still enjoyed the film. This is one YA novel film adaptation series I hope succeeds.

" Theo-cracy gone a bit crazy!
",-0.4003,0.5151,2020-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Ever since I saw him in a UK television drama entitled ""Bedlam"" (2011) I thought that Theo James (""Number Four"") was a man to watch. He was certainly the hook that got me to start watching these adaptations of Veronica Roth's futuristic novels. Well, beauty can only take you so far; the rest has to be down to acting; dialogue etc. and this falls pretty flat on all counts. The premiss is unique - society is divided into five factions based on a perception of virtue. At 16, teenagers have to decide which they have and then they spend their lives living up to the ideals - involving strenuous mental and physical trials. ""Tris Prior"" (Shailene Woodley"") is an exception, however - she doesn't fit into any one category - and so the system has no idea how to cope with this renegade. When she reveals her confused status to James - her trainer - we embark on a tale of cat and mouse as she and a rag-bag gang of misfits set out to save a world that deems them all as a serious threat. It certainly looks good - budget clearly was not an huge issue, and it is broadly faithful to the book but therein lies the problem - it is a preposterous proposition from the outset - it has not even the weakest of anchors from the society we know today (i.e. how the hell could we ever have gotten ourselves into this kind of dystopian mess in the first place?). When romance begins to rear it's head too, then I started to forget how sexy Theo actually is and wonder what else I could watch... There are clearly some parallels with ""The Hunger Games"" series, but this one definitely comes off a very poor second."
" Love Divergent!
",0.6696,0.9879,2020-03-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie is fantastic! It's so good that you don't even feel the two hours go by. The story is compelling and flows naturally. The whole faction idea is really interesting to see. The journey Tris goes through feels natural and not forced. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are equally great as Tris and Four. I thought Zoe Kravitz did a fantastic job as well. The romance is one of the best I have seen in teen movies. The action is suspenseful as the movie goes on you end up wanting more.
This movie ages well and never feels bland."

This young lady Tris Prior and four that reached there maximum limits too new heights as the following movies. Hoping much better than this one."

" Good film, bad action
",-0.1531,0.9982,2020-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Divergent ReviewIn the exciting dystopian sci-fi film Divergent, discovering who you are is much easier than it seems. Taking place in the very run-down city of Chicago, everyone is born into one of the five factions, Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless or Erudite. The different factions are divided by different traits and characteristics of the people, such as the selflessness of abnegation, the honesty of Candor, etc. This is all supposedly to create peace, putting people who are similar together and having them work together to create a successful society. When people come of age, they will get one chance to choose which faction they want to be a part of forever. They have a test to help people find where they will best fit in, however they are free to choose whichever faction they want. Tris, however, finds that fitting in may not be as easy for her as it seems.The setting for this film is very unique and fitting as a post-apocalyptic appearance, and the costumes and outfits are very basic and color-schemed, which is what divides the factions from each other and gives people their identity in a way. There is very little individuality in the factions- each person's role is simply to help the faction and society as a whole. The entire post-apocalyptic dystopian future setting seems to be a somewhat unsuccessful attempt at copying what the Hunger Games did, but with much more training and practicing than action-filled scenes. Tris' duty of climbing up the ranks is a much bigger focus of the film than all of the life-threatening political corruption throughout the film.The overall acting and emotions of the actors is very good, but at times it can seem off and not fitting to the scene, which sort of ruins the way the scene is most likely supposed to make viewers feel. In some intense fights or in the sad scenes, Tris seems almost emotionless. However, this could also be due to the fact that dauntless have to be fearless and not show emotion, being willing to do things they do not want to for the good of the faction. This shows how she is changing from the shy girl to one of the strongest and bravest characters in the film.The script is very easy to follow for as young as young teenagers, making it a great film for most ages. It is put together well and not scattered everywhere, and there is a plot line that you can very easily follow along with and see why certain scenes end up being important later on. Although as stated previously, it seems like just another dystopian future film similar to hunger games, with two main characters who work together to overthrow the unfair and corruptly-ruled system. It starts off slow and then gets very intense towards the end, while lacking the many other action scenes that are scattered throughout Hunger Games which helped make it such a success. The audio and music throughout the film is surprisingly impressive, although mainly just in the few action scenes throughout the movie. There are only one or two true thrilling action scenes before the end of the movie, which seems to be where they crammed in all of the action. However, the music in those final scenes, such as intensifying music to foreshadow an upcoming fight, was very fitting and perfect for putting the viewers in the mood for some long-awaited action.
The cuts between different viewpoints are very good, not switching too fast but also not lingering in one place for too long and making it boring. It has very good editing from scene to scene and makes very smooth transitions, making it pleasant to watch compared to movies with annoying cuts every few seconds. Although there are some scenes where the camera switches angles a bit too often, throughout the film it is consistently good.Overall I rate this film 7/10, because although it was a good movie, I felt as if there was so much more that they could have done to improve it such as adding more action instead of having training for 80% of the movie. The plot line was interesting and easy to follow, but if you are watching it just for intense action, this movie may not be for you. Nonetheless, it is still a very good film and was fun and enjoyable to watch."
" Reductive
",0.0,0.5078,2020-01-04 00:00:00,6,"This review will discuss the entire trilogy. Obviously this series rides on the success of The Hunger Games. The budget was doubled for Divergent once THG made so much money. Unfortunately this series lacks in the qualities the made THG so great first and foremost the main character. Katniss is a born - if not reluctant- leader where Tris, our Divergent heroine is more milquetoast. Just like The Maze Runner, the first movie in the series is the best and the last, kinda sucks. Practically the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen and for this era, the CGI is pretty basic. I like a Dystopian YA stuff and really wanted to like this series but it's never more than ok. In THG you cannot help but cheer for Katniss, really feel her pain but with Tris is like whatev. If you're a fan of this genre it's worth a watch on a rainy Sunday but nothing special."
" Greatly Disappointed
",-0.5256,-0.9494,2019-12-29 00:00:00,5,"I was looking forward to this film because I greatly enjoyed the books, but after watching the movie I was really disappointed. The books are a lot more rough with more gore, more heartache, the world is much more grim and the people are much harsher. This Film downgraded the hardship and brutality that was originally depicted in the book leaving you with a soft movie. It also cut out some very important scenes.Looking at the movie for its face value, by not comparing it to the book; its an okay film. The acting isn't the best but its well filmed and the storyline is very entertaining to watch."

" A Real Snoozer
",0.0,-0.872,2019-10-25 00:00:00,3,"The real shame of this film is that the beginning was decent... and then it fell apart. There was no real character development of which to speak. By the end of the film you feel you *still* don't get the main characters. The acting seemed forced (especially on Kate Winslet's part), and there was no real storyline. I checked out the book to see whether it was a problem on the part of the author or the screenplay. The original material was incredibly poorly written. The redeeming quality of this film comes in the random details, such as Four's tattoo."
" Just another action movie for teenager
",0.0,0.9896,2019-09-15 00:00:00,4,"This review will contain many spoilers regarding the story.Divergent is a movie with good premises, but since the beginning you already know that you are not going to watch an original movie. In fact for the whole duration I had a sense of Deja-vu: set in a dystopian future, after the ending of ""The War"" (?), the Chicago population is divided into 5 different factions. Everyone need to be fitted in one of these categories or you will end up as a homeless and factionless individual rejected by everyone. In order to decide which section you belong, you need to perform a test that tells which is the best faction for you, but during the ceremony day you get to decide which is the best option for you. Our main character is Tris, that during the test seems to belong to more factions. These people are called Divergents and cannot be controlled. They are considered really dangerous from the society and as soon as they detect one, they simply kill them.So, another movie that tells that nobody belongs to a fitted category, that anyone should think with their own brain, and should have their own idea. Nothing original, but premises remains okay. The main issue of this movie is the lenght: almost 2 hours and a half. The first hour is focused on Tris, that after choosing the Dauntless faction, basically the group dedicated to protect the population, tries to integrate herself inside the faction in the best way possible, even if she is clearly not fitted, a thing that insted of being slow cooked, could have been resolved with a short montage, or, if the director felt the need to elaborate on, in a 20 minutes sequence, saving the viewer from the boredom. Finally the story begins and everything is so predictable, including the love story with his trainer, that is in the air since the first moment they met. The main villain is an erudite that want to genocide an entire faction that manage the city, so she, with her faction can finally take over the government. In my opinion she is not very credible as a villain and in the end was also pretty easy to defeat.The acting is very flat, Shailene Woodley has the same expression for the whole movie, you cannot tell the diffference between happiness and sadness on her face and when she acts, she use always the same way of speaking. Theo James is the same. I wonder who did the casting and how they could pick so poor actors, especially if we are talking about the main ones.I will try to watch the complete trilogy, before saying that the entire saga is completely unworth to be watched, but this movie is in fact very predictable: it uses a narrative scheme very well known and that you see a lot nowadays. It is a brainless Hollywood movie made for early teenagers (like 14/15 years old, maximum), if, of course, they manage to go through the entire movie.I gave 4 stars out if 10 because CGI is on point and I really liked this distopian world. Also allucinations inducted by a special serum, are well studied."

" A solid 'young adult' dystopia
",0.1531,0.9944,2019-07-10 00:00:00,8,"This, the first film of three, is set in a world one hundred years after a cataclysmic war. Chicago is effectively a city state and as far as anybody knows there is no civilisation beyond the city. Society is divided into five factions to which people join based on their character type. These are Abnegation, the selfless who are also the governors; Amity, the kind who farm; Erudite, the intelligent; Dauntless, the brave who form the police/army; and Candor, the honest who serve justice. At sixteen people are tested to see which faction best suits them before making the choice as to which they join. Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior, the daughter of Abnegation parents, is one such youngster but her tests are inconclusive... she is 'Divergent'; one with strengths in multiple areas. She is cautioned that she must hide this as Divergents are considered dangerous. The next day she joins Dauntless and begins her training; if she does badly she risks failure and being declared factionless but if she does too well she could be identified as Divergent and killed... if that weren't enough she learns that the leadership of Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation.From the moment the world is described it is clear that the viewer will need to be able to suspend their disbelief... the idea that almost everybody will fit into one of the five described factions and Divergents will be rare seems unlikely. However if you can accept that the film is rather fun. The story may not provide many surprises but there are plenty of exciting moments as Tris and her fellow Dauntless recruits undergo initiations and training. There is also frequently a sense of real danger. Tris; as played by Shailene Woodley, who impressed in the role, is a fine protagonist and other key characters are solid too. The film has high production values with a realistic look and impressive effects. Some have compared this to films like 'The Hunger Games' but while there are some similarities I didn't really think about them at the time. Overall I thought this was as solid addition to the young adult dystopia genre... you certainly don't have to be a teenage girl to enjoy it. I'll certainly be watching the other films in the series."
" Long and tedious
",0.0,0.0106,2019-05-21 00:00:00,4,"This came out around the Hunger Games series and it really shows. It tries to cash in on the YA craze without understanding how it works. The characters are blank slates with no development and the story's long and tedious. The movie focuses on a teenager named Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior who discovers she's a ""divergent"" and has to hide it from everyone or else she'll be killed. She decides to join another faction called the Dauntless where she struggles to fit in at first but finally makes the cut in the end.Along the way she falls in love with one of the instructors named Tobias ""Four"" Eaton(Theo James). At this point it's every YA cliche you know: Her secret's discovered forcing her to go on the run, she supposedly learns more about herself on the journey and all that stuff.So yeah it's nothing new, we've seen this before in better movies such as the Hunger Games and Battle Royale. Skip this movie it's not good."

This happens right after they pass the test where one test is to shoot someone you love! And now they can't shoot 2 bad guys when they know that if they are found out they will be killed! Wtf!?! That is just bad writing and irrational.When her mom saves her from being shot then she wastes the time by stopping and talking to her instead of acting fast as she was trained to do!Later her dad takes her gun and just walks into the billets when he ignorantly following her and is later surprised he died. Makes no sense to put her through this when she just lost her mom and again we know her dad is not a great shot.Later she fights Four - her love as they wiped his mind.

It reminds me of why others make spoofs of bad movies like this movie as it's just filled with irrational and idiotic behavior from the heroes of the entire movie - just unbelievable and stupid!!

" High octane sci-fi movie with some rough edges
",0.0,0.9783,2019-03-16 00:00:00,7,"The concept & the main theme that this movie's ideological foundation is based upon, is catchy. It's good and relatable in the present time. I watched this movie just on whims, I hadn't heard about this movie. This just popped on my ""Recommended"" list and I gave it a chance.The characters are fleshed-out and the cast does a stellar job of portraying them. Although it felt like Caleb's character was severely underused. It's a shame in that department, really. Al is another character that doesn't match up with the plot and feels underused. It almost felt like there are missing scenes that have been cut that could've developed Al's character in the movie that would finally line up with the movie's plot. And one last thing that I'd like to just lay out there is that Andrew Prior's fate seemed extremely forced and for the sake of plot convenience. Like Tris didn't even bat an eye to what happened. It's as if she's in a sim, not the others. Again, felt like missing scenes, & felt like the director was in a hurry to finish the film.It's a very satisfying sci-fi action movie. The plot is linear, but very enjoyable and relatable. It sets up a sci-fi franchise tactfully, and maintains it's tight action plot up until the end. One of the major reasons of what makes this movie good is it's high octane plot.The soundtrack is just awesome at the beginning but after the movie crossed it's intermission it felt ""kinda"" forced. Felt like what was going on screen was flowing through the soundtrack, but was off by a bit. Also I felt that cinematography could have been better.In spite of all the criticisms I ranted about, this is a nice watch in the evening with packet of popcorn in hand. Enjoy it, people.

First of all they cut loads of key parts out (like when Eric got his eye stabbed by a knife) and it felt like the whole thing was rushed!
The actors (well tris and Tobias) are meant to be 16 and 18 so I think different actors should have been required so they didn't look around 30!

" Surprisingly well-developed plot and characters with a good visual feel.
",0.6249,0.9831,2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"While The Hunger Games really cornered the market in the ""young adult dystopian future"" category, many authors jumped on the bandwagon to cash in on this phenomenon. I'll admit that many of these series that got movie adaptations I had never heard of before and likely will not see/read. The Divergent series, though did stand out as the top of ""the rest"".It can be difficult to create a dystopian world, especially one that's at least somewhat set in our current one. The CGI-modified Chicago looks pretty good for a city that's been through what it has, but where the computer imagery really comes to shine is in the dream sequences. I would have liked them to be a little more obvious so the audience isn't always guessing if it's a dream or not, but that's part of the charm, I suppose. Having since read the book this was based on, I do have to say that the director made some good decisions on what areas to cut in order to keep the intent of the book, but at a pace that works better for a film. In fact, the dream sequences were even more difficult to pin down in the book than they were in the movie, so the film did a good job with that.However, this film still struggles with the ""teenage angst"" that many YA adaptations have. Of course, because of this and the aforementioned CGI, this film does get the feeling like it's a mashup of The Hunger Games and Avatar: The Last Airbender. That being said, the plot and societal structure felt thoroughly thought out and it truly helped distinguish between character archetypes when they are connected to specific colors.Surprisingly well-developed plot and characters with a good visual feel, I give Divergent 4.0 stars out of 5."
" An Enjoyable Experience
",0.4404,0.9847,2019-02-11 00:00:00,8,"I believe this movie doesn't get enough credit. People complain it's a carbon copy of the somehow much more successful Hunger Games franchise, but I feel that's not so. Divergent has a much better and more intriguing setting than the Hunger Games, and from the beginning of the movie, I was drawn into the world of the factions and how to co-depend on one another. Whilst with the Hunger Games, I was desperate for ANY source of interest in the setting.
Each actor gives this performance their best, and though I'm not a huge fan of Tris as a character, Shailene Woodley makes me root for her and gives a strong performance. Jai Courtney also gives an amazing performance as Eric and makes him much more intimidating than in the books.
Obviously, the plot is slightly overdone with the ""two teens who are special live in a post-apocalyptic world"". But Divergent offers an interesting setting with interesting characters. It's not the best movie, but I certainly enjoyed it more than the hopeless and depressing Hunger Games.

" In the faction there's too much friction
",0.0,0.9936,2019-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Okay, apparently the post 2010-world likes dystopian Sci-Fi/Fantasy fables made for, and preferably starring, teenage girls. I realize I'm just an old whiner, but these nowadays dystopian stories are soft and weak compared to the terrific and similarly themed films of the 70s, like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Z.P.G"". What was the typical and almost even logical thing to do for Hollywood producers upon noticing the tremendous success of the adaptation of Suzanne Collins' ""The Hunger Games""? Find more reminiscent novels to turn into massively hyped and over-funded film franchises, of course! Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"", ""Limitless"") chose for the books written by the young author Veronica Roth. The main idea behind ""Divergent"" certainly isn't too bad. In the soulless Chicago of the near future, society is divided into five different factions that each have their own color of clothing to illustrate what type of people they are, like grey for abnegation or blue for erudite. Children are born in the factions of their parents and can remain there for the rest of their lives, or they can choose to move to one of the four other factions at the age of sixteen. There exist psychological tests to help you decide which faction suits you the best, because once you made the choice it's forbidden to change again. When the seemingly ordinary teen Beatrice takes the test, however, the outcome is ""divergent"" and this should be kept secret as divergent people are considered uncontrollable, rebellious and a menace to this formula of a peacefully structured society. Beatrice makes the instinctive but illogical choice to join the Dauntless faction, where she must battle daily to become accepted, becomes infatuated by the hunky but mysterious Four and stumbles upon a conspiracy to re-arrange the factions that looks an awful lot like genocide. As said, ""Divergent"" certainly isn't bad and even qualifies as decent entertainment on a Friday night with a bucket of popcorn and a medium-sized beer, but the script is so frustratingly unsurprising and predictable! The supposedly clever plot twists, like the dark secrets of Four or the mysterious background of Tris' mother Nathalie, are so abundantly obvious that you honestly begin to question the level of intellect of the target audience. There isn't a single thing happening in ""Divergent"" that you can't see coming from three railways stations away and, astonishingly enough, Neil Burger doesn't do anything to put his mark on the film. The action footage is very tame, clearly because the producers wanted to maintain the PG-13 rating no matter what, and the use of special effects or futuristic gimmicks is kept to a minimum, which makes you wonder on what they spent the massive $80 million budget. Perhaps on Kate Winslet's erudite haircut?"

",0.3818,0.9729,2018-12-30 00:00:00,6,"Thrilling first installment of a successful trilogy, dealing with a stirring dystopian Sci-Fi in which a beautiful and intelligent adolescent becomes involved into lots of dangers, risks, emotion and violence. As Tris, Shailene Woodley, will be forced to make complex choices about sacrifice, loyaly, courage, love
redemption and allegiance. This is a Science Fiction and drama film based on Veronica Roth novel. Sixteen-year-old Tris Prior : Shailene Woodley, lives in a destroyed city of Chicago, in a difficult society divided into factions and, nowadays, she searches answers on the ruins of the town. As each faction represents a diverse way of handling things. Candor are the honest. Erudite are the intelligent, in which her brother, Ansel Elgort, belongs. Abnegation the selfless, in which her parents : Ashley Judd, Tony Goldwyn belong. Amity the kind. And finally Dauntless the brave, in which Tris enlists herself after an extremely dangerous training . The Erudite led by Kate Winslet , have declared war against Abnegation because they think that they have essential information about Divergent. Then the Erudite scheme a massacre against Abnegation. Then, Tris unlocks secrets , uncovering horrible deeds and along with his partners and with the help from others on his side carry out a strong fight against a nasty alliance run by Kate Winslet which threatens to tear their society apart. Tris takes desperate, disturbing choices, and makes difficult decissions to protect the ones she loves, and, finally, discovering the shocking truth.This first part contains thrills , chills , noisy action, high body-count , breathtaking state-of-art-special effects, enough characterization , and violent happenings . Here our starring Tris faces one impossible challenge after another, as she unreveals the truth about her past and, ultimately, the meaning of the strange and mysterious divergence, as well as the dark future on her sad world . The movie relies heavily on the long interrogatory with excessive use of machines, and abstract images on the dreams performed by Tris , as it turns out to be tiring, confusing and a little bit boring. It is followed by Insurgent 2015 by Rober Schewenke in which Tris approaches the residents of Amity led by Octavia Spencer and meet the factionless and Four's, Theo James, mother : Naomi Watts. And finally, the conclusion and unexpected denouement : Allegiant. Stars Shailene Woodley who gives nice acting as the valiant teen who is really haunted by her past, as well as she must confront her inner demons. She is well accompanied by a good support cast to be with her in the three entries, such as : Ray Stevenson, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, Jay Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, Maggie Q, Ben Lloyd Hughes, and Kate Winslet.The picture has a colorful and brilliant cinematography by Alwin Kuchler. And a thrilling and rousing musixal score by Junkie XL. The flick was well directed by Neil Burger, though it results to be overlong and a little bit tiring. However, Neil did not make the second outing, as he couldn't due to scheduling conflicts with postproduction in this Divergent 2014. Burger is a good professional director who has got some successes as cinema as TV. As he has directed notorious films as The illusionist, Limitless, Interview with an assassin, The upside. And TV series and episodes as Billion, Books, the jury TV, The asset TV, among others. Rating : 6, decent Science Fiction movie that will appeal to teenagers. Well worth watching."

" Divergent (2014)
",0.0,0.4966,2018-12-06 00:00:00,6,"With the premise of usual young adult science fictions ""Divergent"" doesn't make something innovative as a film and with ""The Hunger Games (2012)"" releasing first it prejudices the viewers perception. It was not well structured or even flowing with emotion in my perception since it was capitalizing on more establishing the base of the story among the viewers. The dream sequence of Tris is the only aspect I find innovative. Since I never read the trilogy I may not understand what the story may have for us in the future as a franchise but the initiation of the film series is very ineffective.But it has some plus points.1. Good visuals and well cinematographic vision (Well with that kinda budget what you should question is what you can't do on the visuals).
2. Good cast and mediocre acting.(Well the new actors are pretty famous now)
3. The hype of being a futuristic-same old - post war world sequence :-pOverall - 3/5"

",0.0,-0.9552,2018-12-03 00:00:00,4,"Divergent is a bland experience and they do not do anything new with the story they are telling.ORIGINALITY
This movie has a lack of originality.
Cause 80% of the movie is just Beatrice trying to not be under the line and we see her trying to succeed, that is her desire through out the movie.
They didn't use their time to try something new with the story to improve the experience.CHARACTERS
They didn't try to develop the side characters they choose their time to only focus on Beatrice, It's fine to let the side characters have little screen time but the movie would have been better if they made the side characters have a good amount of screen time and they manage to develop the characters.
Beatrice is this bland character who has no personality whatsoever.
For me it felt like that sometimes she was a bit shy and when the plot needed her to not be shy then she wasn't, when it came to her it felt like her personality was unclear and lacking.
And during the end of the her growing as a character was almost non existent.
She began as a trash fighter and then turned into a decent fighter that's the only growth you will get from her and we never get to see how she develops and becomes a decent fighter cause when she trained hard she was still trash at fighting and then magically she could fight decently cause it was convenient for the plot.
Beatrice is there for plot convenience.
Four is bland as hell.
I'll give them some props for managing to make him grow as a character that's the only good thing about him and that growth felt rushed and poorly executed.
He has more personality than Beatrice and we could clearly see those personality traits.
Four might be bland but he is still better than Beatrice.VILLAIN
The villain was bad she had a lack of screen time and if she had more screen time she would be a decent villain.
I understand her motive that they kill the Divergents cause they are scared of the unknown but i think it could have been developed more.VERDICT
This movie is an unoriginal wasted potential that people should not watch."

" The much less accomplished sibling of THG
",0.3832,0.9767,2018-09-19 00:00:00,1,"Having just finished all three books in the Divergent series I thought they were perhaps a little too detailed, too long. Not amongst the best books I've read. But having pressed play to see this movie I realise there were worse options.I'm wondering most of all how true Roth really was to her original story when she agreed on changing so much of it for this.
It's as if she ripped her books apart and someone picked up pieces and glued them randomly together and said ""let's make a film!"".It's as if a high school group of amateurs decided to reenact it and film it and somehow Hollywood bought it? Lacking everything from context, a fitting soundtrack, well done VFX, good actors (not even Winslet made me happy and definitely did not fit this role), the list goes on and on. But most important of all: so much has been cut off from the original that it lacks all kinds of depth that movies as well as books need to make it something great and make you FEEL it. Divergent the movie was nothing but a falling piece of crap that landed flat and never stood a chance with this rewritten script. This is the unwanted child of Twilight, as well as the less accomplished sibling of The Hunger Games. I dare you to read at least the first book, and tell me I'm wrong in that this should've never been made. Why was it ever?"

The film can be a bit hard to understand if you haven't read the book, especcially since they don't properly introduce some of the characters (Peter, Molly, Al).

Thought it had a really cool story line and lots of fairly original ideas ( it's very hard these days ) kind of a mix of Hunger games and equilibrium if I had to do a comparison. Major complaint is the trying to get the teen audience. If they had ignored this and taken a let's just do a cool movie I think it would have been a lot better. No harm in having an underlying romance (matrix) but it's just to in your face and distracts from what could have been a much more gritty movie. Sunday afternoon with pizza and a hangover movie

Tris' evolution is presented in detail, from a simple student who is about to be kicked out, to one of the best, with a target on her forehead. It looks gorgeous, it's very well written, full of emotion and suspense, entertaining and very thrilling. It also has great characters, very well described, written and presented. It made me more and more curious about the fate of the two protagonists whilst not disappointing me any single time.As a minor downside, it didn't have the most conclusive finale, not even close, but it leaved a good opportunity for a sequel.

" Much better than Hunger Games (that's why I'm writing review)
",0.2263,0.9287,2018-06-01 00:00:00,9,"(sorry for my bad English, I am Serbian) 
I gave this movie high score, because I was annoyed with low score and bad comparison with the Hunger Games trilogy, so although I don't think that this movie deserves score 9 when comparing to all kinds of movies especially classics, I think it deserves score 9 when comparing to similar movies
...ok, here is a brief comparison of the both movies which are the first in their trilogies. First of all, the Divergent has much more better plot, much more interesting story, the world is post apocalyptic - not only post- war like in Hunger Games, and these are first things that come to mind. Second, the chemistry between the characters is excellent in Divergent, and although great team of actors plays in the Hunger Games, their chemistry and excellent acting doesn't really have a good story to tell. Although the Divergent has pretty predictable love story (that is not so relevant to me, I find many mistakes in other places concerning some practical problems) and some other problems that annoy me like : why no one investigates murder attempt on Tris, and how could she be expelled from her fraction after the fight when she wasn't give up or surrender herself, after she had all those points which ranged her up? The actresses are both very very talented, and although I love Jennifer Lawrence, I must say that Shaileen Woodley is far more better (or maybe the character itself is more suggestible) in the Divergent, than Lawence is in Hunger Games. 
The camera is far better in the Divergent because in the Hunger Games 1, the camera is so nervous and moving that it's really annoying the eye of the viewer (when the movie is action, there is no need for this ''nervous''camera)...
Although the Hunger Games has more critical implications on this our world of today (the critic of the reality shows, society differences and most of all, the horrible dictatorship and all of its wickedness) - in that matter both movies are not so comparable - since the Divergent is placed in the post apocalyptic world of tomorrow - which seems to be in some, more or less, justice and order. 
These are the reasons why am I so annoyed with comparing these two franchise. 
The other thing I must say is that The Divergent reminds me on the Twilight trilogy in many ways. For both of them I am very sorry that they are basically MADE FOR TEENAGERS, with lots of juvenile moments and commonplaces, and with illogical mistakes (the Divergent) and much more ''girly'' moments (the Twilight) but what can I say, the writers of the books did it that way so the movies probably couldn't go far from that. 
The Bottom line is: the Divergent is very good action movie, with interesting post appocalyptic world (some kind of mixture of the movies Gattaca and Brave New World book , and some moments from Equilibrium - by far more mature movies or better written novels) but which has appealing atmosphere, at least for me. You will certainly have much more fun watching the Divergent tha the HUnger Games!"

Divergent's being against the law must be hunted and killed, fighting to keep herself alive she fights to save the people within the cities factions and her family, alongside the mysterious four. Divergent is a film that reminds everyone that what makes you different makes you dangerous. This movie is the perfect film about discovering who you are and where your place is in the world.

At the time, this was one of the very few, for me the first such movie, where both of the had a sane mental and charismatic strength and they were both striving to make it a better world.

Firstly I have to say that, even though I watched it on a laptop's screen, I was deeply immerged in this movie, forgetting everything around me, something which nowadays rarely happens to me. The movie started very strong and the hallucination scene was absurdly interesting and exciting. The concept of the five factions was executed well without feeling childish. Although the world felt a bit unrealistic theoretically, which didn't matter in this case because it served the story very well. You could really see that it is also a wink to our own reality. I really liked the design choices of fashion,architecture and weapons. But the whole story felt a bit rushed though and this movie would lent itself perfectly for a serie which would give it more time to unfold its beauty. (edit: I see it's a trilogy, perfect)
I think this movie is just perfect for anyone who loves psychologicy, mature sci-fi worlds and can just even relate a bit to one of the two main characters. In a world full of bland unoriginal fantasy movies filled with bad american jokes, this one really stands out for me as a special one. I just feel bad for the people that couldn't experience the empathy with the characters, as you have really missed something."

One fraction naturally wants all power, so they try to wipe out the fraction that as been ruling by tradition. Cue young hero to expose it all.Perhaps workable as a popcorn movie for the younger crowd, however adults or younger people with some sort of attention span will be bored out of their minds.Passable performances by the two young main characters, poor/sad performances by the ""big names"", specially by Ashley Judd, but she never were that much of an actress anyway."

Nothing special but not too bad either.However... here comes the fine print: Divergent, The Maze Runner, Hunger Games and probably a couple more franchise movies have all something in common - they have literally the same plot. I defecate you not - every one of them is about a teen or a group of teens living in quasi-post- apocalypse settings, in a society different from our own, where the same protagonists rebel against the established order in their own way and fight ""the evil old people in charge"" I DARE anyone to prove the opposite! And... of course since it's a teen movie... as already mentioned there is the ""youthful rebellion"", there is the clichÃ© Hollywood character building that takes almost half the movie and.. oh, of course: the slight sexual tension between the characters.I feel as if I have been robbed those hours watching these movies, and now I engage in even more waste of time by writing a review.

I did get one response once about 7 years before the Internet existed joining a $700 plus dating service giving a in person application that lead to a car drive and a bar date. That was about the last time I think I had a date. Previous to that I had my share but this letter isn't a review of my life. The number one rule nowadays is that the girl must be lifetime money self sufficient living anywhere. That leads just about everyone out. Only 1 in 1000 are that way and the actresses of any fashion be it over twenty of them who weren't one of the 1 in 1000 used slut entertainment thoughts involving me to be a 1 in a 1000 self money sufficient person but the sad movie or singer concept to that is none of those girls thought that sharing their wealth with me was a requirement or even a intro one in person date let alone my preferred minimun requirement thought of 25 dates. So it's understood outthinking their thoughts of what is best for them or what they want or what they are willing to do is at least in my case impossible to outthink or even partially persuade. I'll just say the difference between me and you girl (any girl) is if the girl approached me by mail or in person giving her contact number she'd have to say next to nothing for me to reply if she was attractive and money self sufficient. But for those that weed out hundreds of suitors per day I've never known any of them to focus and when they focus their focus leads nowhere however public popular. I was going to write about 20 reasons why girls are into idiots but this email is already too long. You can though in the immediate future reach me at johniverson4@peoplepc.com There's my contact. Need I say again the difference between me and you girl (any girl). The sad fact is 9 out 10 movie concepts are light years from this letter style with many much more so than others yet those sort that yet detect me feel there is some sort of invite to them when there isn't. I could write pages about how mentally ill I would get getting involved with them. But this letter concept is not looking for dismissal with me and IMDb. I sort of had Ashley Judd in mind when writing this being more positive than negative but more or less focus writing to a star is banned here. Personally it's been decades when getting annoyed by people it's by those you can't find however immediate the interpretation and with I don't even know if they qualify for I wouldn't want to know you or them even if I did. Biggest mistake in writing these emails is if you know that any response if at all will lead you to get mentally ill if I involve myself hundreds of times over with them and not much else especially in money concept or marriage dating then why try at all from the get go. Even at the best if a romantic attitude is established it will probably only be done in some group thought fashion and will having nothing to do with being a couple. That's about the only way current Hollywood fashion stays in fashion. I current thought about Ashley is I'm over 50% positive on my approach to her but there is too she'd have to really a lot kiss my over a long time in person for me to really fall. She with me has a current personality interpretation of that ain't going to happen. It's more her charm with me doesn't much get past bye bye soon enough. I'm not looking for either for the girl with I'm not bluffing but I'm gorgeous attitude and she expects me to sex her big time a half hour minimum everyday. Those types only have a place in my life on paid for out of state DVD XXX delivery for I'm not into intensive in person long girl selfish sex or even quickie looking just for a daddy type girl. I did consider rhyming divergent with Queen machine laundry detergent but doesn't that seem corny?

" I Liked It!
",0.4753,0.922,2017-08-11 00:00:00,7,"Goodness! Many of the other User Comments for this film seem unjustly brutal. I confess I would probably not be considered part of the usual demographic for this type of movie, being more than half way to my 'three score years and ten'. Perhaps it is because of this I was able to just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is - solid escapist entertainment with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure. When our real world currently appears to be going to hell in a hand-basket, what on earth is wrong with a healthy dollop of romance and escapism? Some have accused the film of being totally far-fetched - but isn't that rather the point of a futuristic fantasy film? Again, futuristic/fantasy/ sci-fi films are not usually to my taste and I try to avoid anything with wizards and/or dragons at all costs - not my bag at all.I thought that Theo James as Four and Shailene Woodley as Tris had wonderful chemistry. It was also very good to know that the amorous Mr. Pamuk from Downton Abbey lived to fight another day after all! Does he remind anyone else of a young Charlton Heston, or is it just me?"
" For fans of the novel
",0.3182,0.9263,2017-07-23 00:00:00,5,"Divergent has been compared to other best selling film adaptation before it such as the Hunger Games. Having no prior knowledge about the Divergent film series, one would not be as disappointing if did not enjoy the film. This film is best suited and aimed for those fans that enjoy films as the Hunger Games, Twilight or Maze Runner, and we can see why. As these are more teenage, young adult based theme films. The Divergent Series has done well box office wise which is why it is a trilogy. About the film, the effects and visuals as well done, the presence and lead portrayal of Shailene Woodley is good as she is a likable lead to root for. Divergent is quite long and seems to drag at times though there are some scenes of entertainment in general. It is quite predictable and not as suspenseful or thrilling as one had assumed. Towards the end half, the film plays out more like a romance love story (as we all saw the romance between Tris and Four happening) in which it starts to go slowly downhill and become a little more boring in regards. The film also doesn't show as to why there are fractions of the world split, we are just to assume something happened in the beginning. Dystopian futuristic movies have a certain praise as we enjoy, but without much detail, it becomes a little wondering as to why. In general the film features a lot of stunts, jumping around, running, fighting and other forms of survival."
" Average
",0.0,0.9855,2017-07-09 00:00:00,6,"This does not, in my opinion, qualify as a true dystopian movie/book. At it's core, it's a teen novel that rides the coattails of the Hunger Games, though in fairness, it is original enough not to be called a copy. But the focus is much more on the teen novel aspects of it with the young characters and the romantic storyline with Tris and Four. The dystopian aspects that the movie is named for is pretty shallow. A major point of dystopian fiction is to examine how the actions we are taking right now could affect the future if they are unchecked. Nothing of that nature is present in the regime of government regulated stereotyping. There are no points made or debates raised concerning what it means to be Divergent. Additionally, the strictness of conformity that was expected from the people was not made clear, which I disliked, but I guess that shows how important it is to the story.A major place where it lacked was its weak protagonist. Tris and Four are Divergents, and yet they have very little personality. Tris didn't feel like someone who is different. Honestly, she comes off as one of the most normal and colorless characters I've ever seen. She definitely has the least personality out of any of the other characters she interacts with. She has nothing driving her, and while that may be understandable for someone in her position, that's not the kind of person I'm going to root for. Now, part of that is probably because this was first a book, and that means that Tris' personality could be revealed to readers through her own thoughts instead of ""character moments"". I haven't read the book, but I've read Hunger Games, and I there were a couple of moments and shots that felt like they were trying to translate some of Tris' little interior monologues visually. It didn't help that Shaline Woodly gave a stiff performance that was comprised in large part of her gaping into the camera every few minutes. The other characters had some more personality and a couple had evident beliefs or motivations, but none of them were believable. Now, I don't want to slam on the movie too hard, because it held my attention the whole time and was adequately entertaining, which counts for something. There were enough interesting and active scenes to keep me interested, and there was some good technical work done on it. The action was fine, but there was a problem with people handling injuries a little too well. Tris gets shot in the leg and then is walking on it just fine a few minutes later, and Jeanine seems largely unaffected by the knife that goes *through her hand*. Probably the most striking thing about the movie was the sound mixing. I don't know why that stood out to me, but there was a lot of intensity created by the blending of the score and the other sounds of the movie. However insignificant that may be, it speaks to how unremarkable the rest of the movie was. There was nothing special about the characters, plot, or the world that was created. Yeah, it looked nice, but that doesn't really make up for the fact that it was essentially a pretty bland movie. It was like somebody made an amazingly well-cooked loaf of Wonder bread; as good as it is, it's still Wonder bread so there's only so good it can be. So I won't recommend this one way or the other. If you liked Hunger Games, yeah, you'll like this, but I think this is a couple steps down from that. But don't feel like you're missing out if you haven't seen it. Overall Rating: 7.2/10"

I would recommend this film to people who like film with action (fighting) but also romance. If I were to give this an age rating I would give it a 12+ due to the amount of use of guns and violence.

The director of the film (Neil Burger) decided to create the movie. There are three Divergent but I'll talk about Divergent 1. The release date is 9 April 2014.The story takes place in dystopian and post apocalyptic Chicago where people are divided into four distinct factions based on humans virtues. I love the plot because it is very original and the characters are great. Theo James and Shailene Woodlay are perfect for the movie because They are very credible. But my favorite actor is Theo James, he is beautiful!Specials effects are very realistic, adding to the quality of the movie. But the best in the movie is the sound design, it is captivating, epic.

It turns out her mother went thru the same thing.The movie features decent action scenes and good performances as well as some good scenes where they try to ""scare"" the people trying to get into dauntless.

" 'Divergent' is missing some divergence
",-0.296,-0.9655,2017-04-07 00:00:00,5,"Based on a trilogy of books written by Veronica Roth, Divergent brought to screen by Neil Burger begins as many other similar dystopian films years after the civilization as we know was destroyed by war. One of the surviving pockets is the city of Chicago. In the retro-futuristic ruins that we know from many other films the local community survives by having itself divided into five strict casts, with well defined social roles - agricultural production, justice, social assistance, policing and defense. One has to chose once base on some kind of a hipno-test that detects his abilities and recommends the future path. There is no return. Outfits are thrown out of the system in kind of a homeless world. Those who do not fit into the patterns are feared, and eliminated when identified. They are the Divergents.The film is the story of one of them - a teenage girl who chooses to train to become part of the more exciting military-policing cast - or maybe two if we add her trainer who has one secret in his pocket - as they fight the system, try to adapt, but do not find their way of integrating, so they revolt. The premises are almost as strict as the social rules of the world that is being described in the film, and it would have taken quite a lot of talent and character building in order to overcome a simplistic approach. Unfortunately this is not the case, and the film hesitates between a future vision which is not original enough and a teenage fighting adversity story which is not complex or interesting enough.Director Neil Burger of The Illusionist fame quite disappoints here. I should say that he disappoints again, as after that 2006 movie he never got back to the level of story and characters building that he reached there. He never succeeds to exceed the clichÃ©s of the The Hunger Games genre. No, this is not supposed to be a compliment. Divergent is too much resembling many other films of its genre, the young Shailene Woodley and Theo James act well but they are no Jennifer Lawrence and the presence of Kate Winslet in a well built supporting role is not enough to save this film from a very average grade. Divergent is missing some more divergence."
" Yet another teenage dystopian fairy-tale
",0.0,0.959,2017-04-01 00:00:00,2,"Our teenage female heroine is Tris. Like most adolescents she needs to be part of a group, establishing at the same time that she is much superior to her peers.In her society people are conveniently divided in 5 factions (actually, 6), according to virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite (plus the factionless, the pariah of the new society). At a certain age, teenagers must decide which faction to join, regardless of the faction of origin. They are previously tested to establish their main trait and make a better choice about the faction to choose.Choices outside their birth faction are frowned upon, but still allow for the protection of belonging to faction. Not so easy for Tris. She is ""special"", therefore a threat to society because she thinks ""independently"" - whatever that means.Those like her are called ""Divergent"" and are the object of a secret witch hunt. So Tris must succeed her initiation in the adult world, while hiding her true self. It could have been a mildly interesting story, but there are too many problems, both with the plot and the filming. What of the factionless? Are they also divergent or just lazy misfits? Why nobody seems to care about this main issue of their society? Isn't the elimination of the ""divergents"" too radical a way to deal with an alleged problem?Finally, instead of developing a comprehensive plot, half of this very long movie is devoted to Tris' initiation into the Dauntless faction. Scene after scene are about her tests and trials moving the plot nowhere, except for the introduction of a dumb love story.Targeted to the same audience of The Hunger Game, this is yet another movie that made me check the time more than once. It drags along forever and the ending is so open and silly that one can hear it screaming out loud for a sequel."

It is a very engaging plot and all of the actors did a great job portraying the characters. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I never get bored or sick of it."
" Doesn't Rise Above Contemporaries (From An Adult Perspective)
",0.0,0.9619,2017-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Whenever most books or films are made for the young adult audience, there are certain ""benchmarks"" that need to be hit in order to appeal to the target audience (e.g. attractive actors, romance, angst, simple concepts). While those benchmarks make those works extraordinarily popular for that target audience, they also limit the book or film's appeal to a broader population. That is why, at least for me (28-year old male), ""Divergent"" was just an ""okay"" movie.For a basic plot summary, ""Divergent"" tells the story of Tris (Shailene Woodley), a teenage girl living in a future society where each person must choose from a prescribed list of professions upon a certain date. There is an aptitude test that helps determine which profession one should tend towards. The trouble with Tris, however, is that her test comes up ""divergent"", meaning that her brain doesn't focus on just one of the areas. This is something that must be hidden, as it is looked down upon and may make her a danger to government officials like Jeanine (Kate Winslet). Choosing a profession that is somewhat surprising, Tris makes the transition to a soldier-type life, where she meets Four (Theo James), a superior who is tough on her but also shows an interest in her well-being.I liked the framework upon which the plot of this movie is built (I've never read the book, so I really can't make comparisons). Every high school student has taken a ""which career should I choose?"" test, so the concept is very relate-able. The whole ""what to do next in life"" is something we can all relate to, young adults probably more than anyone.The problem, though, is that ""Divergent"" tries to cram a lot of things into a relatively small (2 hours, 15 minutes) package. There's drama, action, romance, political intrigue, big ideas...a little too much to focus on making one or two areas really, really good. For example (minor spoiler ahead), there is one character death in the movie that is supposed to be a very sad, emotive moment. However, because the relationships hadn't been developed well enough up until that point, it just kind of falls flat.Contemporary films like ""Hunger Games"" and ""The Giver"" (both films that I enjoyed) do a better job of ""camouflaging"" the young adult aspects (though not omitting them, obviously) in order to appeal to a broader audience. ""Giver"" pulls not punches that it is a concept-driven film first and foremost, while ""Hunger Games"" (like the book series) doesn't get into the real angst-y, drama stuff until later on in the series. Thus, I felt like ""Divergent"" takes the action of the Hunger Games and the concepts of The Giver and combines them to produce...an inferior product of that melding.""Divergent"" isn't a bad movie but any stretch of the imagination. It has a decent plot, the action always moves forward, and drama is present. It just won't captivate audiences beyond its target range of teenagers."

I cannot believe the human race would reduce itself into five factions which are segregated by a test, but then they get to choose which faction they want to join. Not only are the factions designated by job, but by uniform, colour, and even their homes. They are not allowed any personal items as that might bring forth human nature. Imagine Humans being Human, what a notion!The acting is just okay, even the bigger name actors, Ashley Judd, Maggie Q, Ray Stephenson, and Kate Winslet couldn't lift this film out of the morass the story and direction placed it in.I don't know how they could've made the movie any better other than a total rewrite and refilm.However, the action sequences aren't too bad except for the fight training... doesn't anybody remember Martial Arts in this stupid, segregated, and insanely dull future world(?)I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone.

An attempt to copy the idea from The Hunger Games, which is not necessarily a bad thing, if they didn't totally fail at it. What we have as a result is a lame copy, with poor visual effects and a really (and I mean really) bad choice of protagonist. While the man is going to have a lot of teenage girls fans, her appearance is just not adequate for the character she is supposed to represent, and in my humble opinion she failed in trying to look bad-ass. The plot is flawed, pretty shallow and not arising any emotions.Will give the second sequel a chance to prove me wrong, although that is hardly possible, since I think the whole movie needs to be redone in order to make it better."

Janet for instance and Christina were both played as if they were three dimensional people with lives before and after the story begins and ends. I also found Four quite credible but sadly, Triss the dauntless did not leave up to the promise she showed early in the film as a wannabe.And Yet...Overall, I found the film worked very well. The scene setting was as I expected it and the dialogue was realistic. As I said earlier. Really good, even though I expected more."

Tris and her companions are set a series of physical and mental challenges, which add variety and tension to the plot. There is a strong cast, including Kate Winslet as the cold and calculating Jeanine, Ashley Judd as a caring mother, and various others, not to mention the pretty couple of Shailene Woodley and Theo James as Tris and Four.It's all set in a suitably post-Apocalyptic world, coloured by the different-hued garbs of the factions.
