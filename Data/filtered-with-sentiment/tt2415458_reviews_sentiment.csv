" Eveything a documentary should be..and more.
",0.0,0.9582,2019-02-09 00:00:00,8,"I've always loved documentaries...and this reminded me why.The Wolfpack is beautifully made, everything a documentary should be and more.
Hidden away in bustling Manhattan live the Angulo family. Comprised of 6 quirky and highly imaginative brothers, who despite having extremely limited access to the outside world, and created their own. Constantly playing characters and portraying scenes from their favorite films. Both disturbing and charming, getting a glimpse into their incredible isolated existence was inspirational.Filmmaker Crystal Moselle showed us all the sides to the Angulo families life, the loneliness and social confusion, the innocence and naivity, the fun and outrageous shenanigans, and the painful backstory. Like any good documentary it left you wanting more.

" Some Crazy Kids
",-0.34,0.8625,2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,"An in depth look at these kids quoting cool movies.
Shut in locked out from the outside world simply unknowing of society
Good documentary feel like it could have been shorter and better edited
Wasn't as invested in it as I could have been"
" Wolfpack? Come on!
",0.0,0.876,2018-11-17 00:00:00,3,"Watched it hoping it was going somewhere, but not!! I thought it was an interesting tidbit to mention in passing, but to make a documentary out of it? What a waste of money and time. I have better things to do with my time, much better."
" Could be a little more powerful
",0.4243,-0.4945,2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"The documentary that leaves you with many different feelings. The failure of the father with the outside world, the psychological problems, the desperation of his mother, the silence of his mother maybe the cowardly, the communication of the boys with the father was given in a beautiful flow. More lively documentary with video recordings used in the past. Throughout the film you are watching with a lot of questions and emptiness. There is a lot of information, especially about his brothers, but his sister's world is not mentioned. 84 minutes is less, you think ""but then"" when the movie is over"
" The Real Underground Filmmakers
",0.0,0.9947,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"7 kids, one apartment, a lot of time on their hands, no experience with the outside world, all the movies they can watch. What you have is one peculiar documentary about perhaps the most interesting family I've ever seen in film. The film doesn't always give them the kind of star treatment they need, but director Crystal Moselle was just out of film school at the time, so let's not forget to grade this on a curve. Actually, the fact that she made this straight out of film school is a magnificent feat. The Wolfpack is fascinating, haunting, and hopeful. I felt for these 7 kids. I liked them, a lot. They are so sweet, and curious about the world, and they articulate it through the movies. You know, I relate to that so much. I for one, have lived through the movies as well, perhaps not as thoroughly as these guys, but when you have social anxiety as a child you tend to gravitate towards the make-believe. I loved these kids, I hated their father (even though he seemed to redeem himself at the end), and I wish them all the best of luck going forward. This documentary is GOOD."
" Not enough backing up to bring in more
",-0.0191,-0.9508,2017-01-07 00:00:00,3,"I don't really like of how everything layout when it seem everything to be bland in into one. Telling the plot without showing it isn't much of knowing what is there. And I don't really like how much this shown us of how poorly setup and not enough timing in it. Almost like as if none of it has been script I guess it have many retake just to get one scene. They rather make a reality show then making a movie.Why I say it have to be reality show then being a movie: All of this showing what they do in their life and places they first went seem like a reality shows. About them making copy of the movies into real like is kinda like drama reality. Sad story about who they are. Video of them and camera view of where they are at, all of this seem like reality show then a documentary movie. The more I watch this, the more that it seem fake to me. I try to force myself saying that it is real but my heart keep on telling me that it is fake. I heard story, read books, and even look it up trying to make myself seeing this a real life documentary but how they set this movie up make it seem more like a reality show vs being a documentary."
