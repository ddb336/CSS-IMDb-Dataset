" Surprisingly moving depiction of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary events.
",0.296,0.914,2021-03-15 00:00:00,8,"The subject of Ang Lee's ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" isn't the war in Iraq but in how America reacts to its heroes and its soldiers and it's a theme that can be traced back through two World Wars. Indeed for almost as long as movies have existed the cinema has concerned itself with the relationship between the military and the world at large, how it performs and how it is perceived. The most famous example of this is probably the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima and the subsequent 'tour' back home immortalised in such films as ""The Outsider"" with Tony Curtis as Ira Hayes and Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and Oliver Stone's Vietnam film ""Born on the Fourth of July"" so it was only a matter of time before someone would do something similiar with one of the current wars.Moving back and forth in time between the events in Iraq and the tour to celebrate the 'heroes' Lee's film is a complex and surprisingly satirical picture that doesn't go down the obvious route of 'what really happened and how the media constructs events' and, being an Ang Lee film, is very skillfully made. As Billy Lynn, the soldier chosen to be the poster boy for the military, newcomer Joe Alwyn is excellent and it's a film that ultimately confounds our expectations. The chest-thumping of ""Born on the Fourth of July"" is conspicuously absent and if the film seems to lack a big dramatic pay-off it's still a moving depiction of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary events."
" What a disappointment - here is a list of why
",-0.5106,0.1956,2021-03-15 00:00:00,3,"The trailer looked good and I wanted to like the movie. I know it was based on a book which I did not read so I don't know if the book was badly written or the movie was but the end result was weak. Lots of spoilers here - so be warned.I can see soldiers being brought back and honored and at times the troops are honored and other times they are shown being treated horribly.I have seen people ask soldiers what it was like to kill someone, but never a journalist during a press conference. Nor the other tone deaf questions that any rational person would see would put an active service member in an uncomfortable situation.The stadium part of the movie was written by someone who has never seen how these things work - which makes me wonder why people like Vin Diesel, Kristin Stewart and Chris Tucker signed on if they read the script.A PA announcement does not recognize people in the crowd when no one is there. If you have VIPs in the crowd who you invited, you may want to stash them in a suite, club level or have personnel close by to shoo people away. Choking a fan out in the middle of the game would get you expelled if not arrested. No one puts on a half time show with Destiny's child and gives soldiers who are playing a big part in the show instructions on the fly, including what to wear just prior to the show. A fight between crew and your VIPs on the stage just after halftime would be noticed. No crew guy would do this and expect to keep his job, nor could he get all his buddies to ambush the VIPS in the loading dock. VIPs may be taken down to the field for pregame, but they sure as helll are not going to start tossing footballs around. No movie deal gets made in two weeks. No real Texan argues that Texans are not good soldiers by stating the Alamo defenders got their ass kicked by the Mexicans. 5000 vs 182 - they knew they were going to lose and they chose to fight and die to delay the Mexican army. I don't see professional cheerleaders chanting a stupid cheer when the soldiers walk down between them - that is junior high, high school. In college they cheer, in pros, it is more a dance team than traditional cheerleaders. Cheerleaders are contract workers so when the cheerleader says it is her job to visit hospitals and kids, that is an sometime thing and not a profession - all professional NFL cheerleaders do other things for a profession or while a college/grad student and do the cheerleading on the side.Wanted to see this movie and I guess I am glad so I don't wonder what I missed, but if you miss this, you are not missing much."
" A Wasted Use of Technology on a Film that Lacks Substance
",-0.4939,0.997,2021-03-09 00:00:00,5,"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is directed by Ang Lee and stars Joe Awlyn, Garrett Hedlund, Chris Tucker, Steve Martin and Kristen Stewart. The film tells the story of a 19-year-old Iraq soldier being brought home for a victory tour after a harrowing battle where he lost someone close to him. Billy recounts these memories while attending a football game where he comes to terms with his mental unrest. Released in 2016 Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk was meant with mediocre reception and struggled at the box office, only earning three-quarters of its budget back.I went into Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk not knowing what to expect but was hoping for something interesting due to Ang Lee's directing and while the film does have some visually interesting moments, much of the story and a couple of the performances left more to be desired. Similar to Peter Jackson making headlines for shooting The Hobbit trilogy using 48 frames per second, with Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk Ange Lee chose to ramp that up by filming the entire film using 120 frames per second as well as in 3D. It was the first of its kind, and while I am not sure if the 3D was necessary for this type of film, seeing a movie in 120 frames per second was interesting. It's something that individuals may find jarring and not totally enjoy, as it deviates so much from the typical 24 frames per second that it might come across cheap or unnatural. While I found it be relatively interesting to look at, creating some truly engrossing shots (such as the halftime performance), there were many instances where the film almost felt like it was a made for T.V. movie; however that may also have been due in part to the dated structure of the movie.While I enjoy films that take place in real-time or over the span of one day, the structure in which Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk presents its story felt tiresome and almost like something that was released in the '90s. There was something about this film that had an aura of 'been there, done that' and it felt like a failed attempt at a character study. As I mentioned earlier the story plays out through flashbacks and much of those scenes lacked any sort of substance, that by the end of the film I felt like a had a very surface-level understanding of Billy Lynn. It's clear from the start that the filmmakers set out to create a rich character study, but I can more or less sum up his character in about a paragraph or two. The film's message about the traumas of war and how events can affect one's own mental health also didn't come across as deep as it was probably intended, there are plenty of other war films that have presented this topic more thoroughly than what is found here.
Lastly, I wasn't sold on all of the performances. Garrett Hedlund plays a sergeant in this film and totally sells it, I thought he was the best and most consistent actor in this film. Everyone else is mostly fine, Vin Diesel isn't super cringe in this film, however isn't amazing and Kristen Stewart you can take it or leave it. Now Joe Awlyn who plays the title character is pretty hit or miss, there were moments where he felt convincing and times where his delivery felt off and like he was reading lines off a page. With this being his first breakout role there are aspects to his performance I can overlook as he is a first-time actor after all, it's just there are moments in the film where I wish he could have given a bit more.Overall Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is an interesting film; I was mostly entertained throughout and the technology that went into the creation of this film is intriguing, however, it felt like a wasted opportunity due to its dated story. I didn't feel like the film was executed as well as it could have been and is not something I see myself remembering a couple of weeks from now. It's not a horrible film and it is worth the watch for the spectacle, as the film has visually interesting moments whether their appealing or not is dependent on the viewer though, however, the story lacks the substance to take it over the top and for that reason, I am giving Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk a 5.5/10"

" Ambrose Bierce: veteran; Hemingway: veteran; Oliver Stone: veteran; Ben Fountain: lawyer & real estate developer
",0.0,-0.204,2020-07-19 00:00:00,1,"IMO-the best war-experience scripts and films derive from those who experienced the battle. Take Stone's trilogy Platoon, Born on the 4th, and Heaven and Earth-all 3 scripts based on memoirs. Even ""From Here to Eternity"" was adapted from a fictionalized memoir written by a veteran who lived through Pearl Harbor. The adage ""write about what you know"" is particularly important when it comes to war films. Ang Lee should have spent 40 million dollars on an Iraq War veteran's story vs a real estate developer and novelist's idea of what might have happened in Iraq."
" Shlepping To The Theater
",0.0,0.9506,2020-07-07 00:00:00,10,"Because it was filmed and projected (in Manhattan, at least, at the AMC Loew's on 68th Street) at 120 frames per second, this was an interested movie from a technical standpoint, even before I saw it. One of the last posts to that thread noted that SLATE didn't like the movie. Because I like Ang Lee's movies, don't worship SLATE and wanted to see if the 120 fps makes any noticeable difference, I saw it anyway.Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is set half in Texas and half in Iraq. It's about a publicity event as a football stadium in which the newly christened hero of the war (Billy Lynn, played by screen newcomer Joe Alwyn) and his buddies are honored in an event of All-American hoopla, with flashbacks to that horrid day in Iraq. Like most Ang Lee movies since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it is a thorough, slightly ponderous, but ultimately excellent movie which I can wholeheartedly recommend, touching on themes of friendship, Americanism, family, isolation and PTSD.What about the 120 fps? It was extraordinary, because unlike the 48 fps techniques used in The Hobbit, Lee and his DP, John Toll shot it to emulate 3-point photography, which mean s it wasn't weird. There was almost none of the eye-strain I associate with 3D, although there was a greater sense of depth, with a psychological flattening, like looking at the figures in a pop-up book. This increased the sense of isolation.It's still experimental technology and was supervised by the company that made the projector. The film stopped once, resulting in some computer code, a ten-minute delay and a free pass to any AMC theater in the city. Even without the Annie Oakley, it was worth it"

" Very, very good movie
",0.5379,-0.1371,2020-05-15 00:00:00,9,"This is the genre that I do like and I am giving the chance to many movies that, on a first glance, does not ave such a good ratings. But, as we seen many times, and it is becoming almost a rule, 6.2 in a moment I am writing is completely wrong. What is also interesting is that those guys who took their time to write the review in general gave very high scores - and it is a pity that others who disliked it didn't eve bother to write why.In general, story is simple - band of soldiers are back home, after a heroic episode back in Iraq. And, similar to the ""Flags of Our Fathers"", a movie about the battle of Ivo Jima, they are dragged around in order to bond the ordinary citizens with the US war efforts.Thought the one short episode which show portion of their their exploitation as a gunny pigs for higher purposes, enhanced by the flashback of the time in Iraq, Ang Lee brilliantly draws the hypocrisy of the society, where noting but pure marketing is important - not the actual causes of the engagement half the World away, neither the real struggle of the band - subtle, Lee is teaching us that all of this is completely irrelevant, except the pure, selfish goal that is supposed to unite the nation over something extremely questionable. Following that goals, the lives and fears of man who served are irrelevant - they are just the mean for higher political stakes.And all of that is said in a easy, almost satirical way (following the original novel by Ben Fountain), which, if seen superficially doesn't mean a lot. But with small portion of actual thinking, this makes one hell of a good movie, including brilliant acting of young Joe Alwyn!"
" ""In the imaginary world of the movie, I found a temporary place to live""
",0.0,0.3863,2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,"One ""Li An is a director who will never repeat himself, this film will be very original""Li Anzhong's new film ""Billy Lynn's Long Intermission"" was officially renamed ""Halftime"".After the trailer was first exposed, it was regarded as an Oscar seed next year.The film is based on the best-selling book of the same name.The original novel won the National Book Award. Also rated as one of the 12 greatest English novels of the 21st century by the BBC.
The film tells of Billy Lynn, a 19-year-old Texas boy, enlisted in the Iraqi war,He survived a crossfire,Accidents and comrades-in-arms became the focus of the public's attention and were shaped as heroes.Afterwards they returned to the country and conferred honours at halftime during the football game.This war hero is facing unprecedented mental suffering ...
Why did Ang choose this movie to shoot?Because Li An wants to challenge an unprecedented technical problem: at a speed of 120 frames per second, 4K and 3D technology are combined to set off a movie visual revolution.What do you mean?The so-called ""movie is a lie of 24 frames per second"", of which 24 frames are the number of frames.In ""The Hobbit"", I have tested 48 frames. There are praises and depreciations. The smoothness of the picture is obviously improved. But because it is too obvious, it is criticized as a television. Movies are more like watching actors performing.As soon as the words came out, James Cameron, who originally planned to shoot ""Avatar 2"" with 60 frames, changed back to 48 frames.However, Li An, who was in the sixtieth year, chose to go against the current.Not only to choose a high number of frames, but also to choose 120 frames, 120 frames is five times the normal film.What is this concept?
This is the smoothest and most realistic movie. Every detail will be clearly displayed on the big screen.Normal movies provide some slow-motion close-ups when dealing with war scenes, so that the audience can keep up with the action.But Ang refused to use slow motion, on the grounds that it was not the real war experienced by the soldiers.He wanted to use this state-of-the-art technology to capture the real battlefield experience, how terrifying it was!Without letting the audience experience extremely realistic battlefields, how can they feel the protagonist's heart?This is a pioneer director who is constantly forcing himself, pushing the limits, and pursuing innovation.Thus, there was this magnificent experiment.At present, this technology is named ""immersive digital technology"".Li An is stepping into an unprecedented technical field. This time, the way he chose was extremely dangerous.""In a way, I 'm naive. I 'm just excited about what I see. Sometimes, this kind of experiment will affect the entire industry. I sometimes feel very vulnerable. My purpose is to show people: Did you see that? Did you see what I just saw? This is all my motivation. ""Ang carefully scrutinized the impact of these changes. By the way, he also found that what he thinks will become a powerful tool for future filmmakers."
" VERY GOOD NON WAR MOVIE
",-0.2431,-0.925,2020-03-15 00:00:00,9,"This is very good war about soldiers trying to come to terms with coming home to superficial, commercial, American Life whilst trying to balance the harsh reality of belonging in a role that they didn't want, in a war that is completely wrong and will probably die for or at least be psychologically scarred for life.The irony is that this is a movie about fighting for a country that views war as movie. Very sad, but poignant.Ang Lee delivers yet again."

It's well worth the price of admission to experience the balance, lack of judgement and as a bonus, some spectacularly crafted scenes that are created. It's relatable and in some ways a magical movie."
" An important first step
",0.2023,-0.9348,2019-08-27 00:00:00,4,"In Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, a group of soldiers come home from Iraq to participate in a halftime show during a Thanksgiving football game. Since this war involved my generation, I always rent these movies. I was looking forward to this heavy drama, because the trailer looked so good, and because I'm always appreciative of Ang Lee's talent.However, as more and more Iraq war movies get made, audiences are allowed to become more discerning. This one, with exception to one scene, isn't that great. The one scene is shown in a flashback, as the featured squad prepares for an invasion. Vin Diesel, the commander, embraces every one of the soldiers and tells them individually, ""I love you,"" so if the worst happens, their last interaction would be a loving, supportive one. It's extremely touching, and sad, since Vin gets killed and Garrett Hedlund has to take over.The titular character is played by Joe Alwyn, in his film debut. There are some important elements in the script that the filmmakers wanted to convey to the audience, and while they are conveyed, there's room for much more to be included in the running time. It is clear to the audience that the classic phrase, ""Thank you for your service,"" is little more than lip service to some, and it is clear that many people are insensitive to returning soldiers. The boys are herded around, and no caution is paid to loud noises, spotlights, and fireworks that could trigger unpleasant flashbacks. After those points are made, though, the movie feels a little empty. A far meatier choice that will deliver on its promise to make you cry is Thank You for Your Service, so you might want to check that one out instead.DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There is a bit of handheld camera and flashing lights, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

",-0.5994,0.9178,2019-07-03 00:00:00,8,"The reviews that accurately bring up the cheesy tone of this film prompted me to write this.Of course it's cheesy. Operation Iraqi Freedom was entered into on false pretexts and used as a test for the patriotism of skeptics, in Congress and among the electorate. The fighting on the ground was real, as it is in all wars, but the impressions gathered and created by ""embedded"" journalists, sent home via satellite, and viewed on cable news and the internet, were designed to manipulate. Here is our new professionalized all-volunteer armed services, heroically whupping Iraqi terrorist ass, to protect our way of life in the good old USA.It goes without saying that servicemen and women work hard and serve heroically. We've seen those images in the actual combat footage and thoughtful films like Flags of Our Fathers and The Best Years of Our Lives. But for those of us at home, the politicians, the politically connected business people, the book publishers, the media executives, the professional sports tycoons, the advertisers, and the enthusiasts and skeptics alike on the sidelines, Iraqi Freedom was a media event. It was a spectacle and a medium onto which we projected our own enterprises, prejudices, world views, and interests.And that is what this film represents. War is only real for the men and women who fight it."
" 10/10 for picture and sound. A must buy on 4K Blu-ray
",0.0,0.9853,2019-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Billy Lynn's long halftime walk.Billy Lynn's long halftime walk isn't a great movie.
In fact as a piece of storytelling it's a mediocre affair that is slightly elevated by some decent performances by a committed cast.
However as a technical achievement this movie is astonishing to behold.
Originally shot at 120 frames per second the movie transfers on to UHD disc at 60FPS due to limitations of the technology at this time.
Most cinematic releases are shot at 24FPS giving this film more than double the frame rate of most movies.
What this means as we get all nerdy is that Ang Lee's film looks hyper realistic.
A film that has a super sharp image whilst motion manages to be super smooth.
The higher frame rate also
gives an added sense of depth. This is a movie that is a must buy on 4K Blu-ray. A disc that is of reference quality and will bring out the best of your UHD HDR television.
The 4K resolution produces a ultra clean image with no grain and HDR is the most impressive I have ever seen on 4K Blu-ray.
Colours are so bright that they burst not pop!So let's touch on the film a little as we've nerded out somewhat so far on tech specs.19 year old Billy Lynn is brought home for a victory tour after he performs great acts of heroism whilst serving in Iraq.
Through flashbacks during the film we see what really happened to Billy and his squad.
Ang Lee's film is a little slow and clumsy and never really ignites.
It is only the way that this film looks and sounds that will keep you invested.
The movie has a Dolby Atmos soundtrack which is also of reference quality.
The battle scenes are immersive as bullets and bombs wizz overhead.
It is in fact the halftime show that best showcases your Home cinema system with some deep bass and impressive drum rolls.
Sound comes from all angles making this film a must buy if you want to impress your friends with your set up.
Sadly though, judged solely as a movie it is nothing special.Picture 10

" Uneven, but Entertaining Iraqi War Film
",-0.3612,-0.9872,2018-09-09 00:00:00,6,"Billy Lynn' s Long Halftime Walk kept my attention for the entire film; that alone puts it above a five. However, Ang Lee had some problems with this film, and some of the cliches that crept into it. I thought the director and actors did a pretty good job; I was impressed by Diesel, and especially impressed by Steve Martin, who shows once again, that he can play both sides of the screen coin of comedy or drama. People seem to have misunderstood this war film more than any other war film I have seen over the last fifty years. It is not a satire, or a piece on heroism, or even a piece on conflicting human emotions; all of which are present in one form or another. I believe the film is more about America's schizophrenic approach to every war we have ever had since WW2. There is a ton of heroism, tragedy, drama, and hypocricy in every war; the Iraq war is no exception. The scene that boils down the true value of these soldiers is perfectly highlighted when a powerful man like the owner of the football team, who is making millions, and owns players who are making millions for playing a kid's game, begins bargaining with the men who are putting the most on the line for the US in the entire stadium. $100,000? This lowlife is going to squabble over $100,000, when the lowest paid player on the team makes a few million. The worst that could happen to him is get a blown knee. It is the hypocricy of Americans which is the real story of the film. No wonder those boys cant wait to get back to the war. The same principle held true during the Vietnam War; guys went back for two and three tours, even though several of them had been shot at least once, because when they got back to the US, they were completely ignored; even worse than the poor guys in the Iraq war. And they were ingnored if they were lucky; otherwise they were considered psychos. The scene with the female choreographer of the halftime show infuriated several viewers the most; insisting on camoflage outfits instead of dress greens just because it ""looked"" better for the show. Although the guys stand up to the owner, they didnt stand up against this twisted hypocrite. That seemed to be inconsistent with the rest of their actions. It is only in football stadiums that you find guys kneeling down to protest the National Anthem; you will never see it in baseball or baseball stadiums. This is why I love baseball so much more than football. Unfortunately, that could not be used in the film because it was made just prior to those outbreaks. So, in closing, I believe this film is about American hypocricy and ambivalance toward the Iraq War and its unfortunate soldiers, not the contrast between actual events and America's perceptions of heroic deeds. Recommended, despite the fantasy cheerleader subplot."
" Inspiring and extraordinary
",0.4215,-0.4129,2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,Ang Lee's new film represents a beginning-point neither anti-war nor war hero film but to deconstruct a truely human being with manifold emotions and thoughts.
" Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk boasts impressive technical direction but suffers from dullness.
",-0.7269,-0.9788,2018-02-24 00:00:00,5,"It's sad to say, in my opinion, this was a misfire from Ang Lee. He is one of my favourite directors when it comes to metaphorical storytelling. So it's a real shame that this had none of that and instead was a boring pointless war drama. Billy Lynn returns home with the rest of his squad after a courageous attempt at rescuing a fallen comrade in war. Now made famous, him and his team look for support by his seemingly patriotic country. But really what it comes down to is money. Film rights, headlines, halftime shows...just people exploiting heroism for greed. Aside from that aspect, everything about this narrative has been told before and far better executed. Technically, Ang Lee's masterful touch enhances the psychological perspective of Billy Lynn. The heightened frame rate, direct address to the camera, muting background noise. We view the story from his perspective, and that also includes the flashback montages of the battle scenes. They are explosive and intense, problem is it's far too minimal. The focus is purely on this Halftime show at a Texas football match, to which I just was not interested. Only two moments caught my intrigue. Firstly: ""oh my god, is that Chris Tucker? I miss him in films!"". Secondly: ""no way! Is that Steve Martin!? Please let him say ""Blueeee Monkehhh""...please!"". The rest of the cast were standard, monotonous and had no real impact. The script was tediously dull. The pacing was extortionately slow. The biggest gripe though? That was not the real Destiny's Child! I feel cheated. Ang Lee can do much better, not sure why he wanted to do this but he was not the right director. Just another post-war drama that struggles to highlight the psychological effects of conflict."

" A real head scratcher.
",0.0,0.8685,2017-12-14 00:00:00,5,"To summarize, I feel like that Randy Jackson's words from the Geico commercial sum it up best: ""yo check it out dawg, that was just alright for me. I mean you got the walk, you got the stance, but I wasn't feeling this. You gotta come a little harder, you gotta figure it out. Ehhhhhh I don't know.""The visual effects in the movie were much more amazing than the movie itself, especially during the half-time show. Even after the movie's concluded I find myself sitting here, wondering and thinking just what the movie was supposed to accomplish and did it do it? Certain aspects of the movie are touching and heart-felt, while a majority fail to stick the landing they were going for. The ending fight scene was ridiculous and if a gun was fired inside a building in a crowded stadium, someone would've gone to jail for it, no matter their rank. I understand the need to want to create drama, but let's color in the lines and not over-exaggerate (i.e. the soldiers act more like a group of frat boys than they do actual soldiers). I'll circle back to the cinematography - it was truly top notch and the war scenes were alluring, but it seems like there's a ton of build-up to the half-time show and while thats visually the best part of the movie, it just seems like there was no substance otherwise."
" Ambitious film that did not quite deliver
",0.4767,0.737,2017-12-02 00:00:00,6,"The major failure of the film is the unconvincing portrayal of military staff and war scenes. If the goal is to take the audience to a tour into the emotions and point of view of a 19-year-old soldier who became a war hero, the details must be accurate in a realistic sense. This is true even if the discussion does not focus on the battle itself. As a tradition of Ang Lee, the scenes are shot with great clarity and contrast in colour; however, while it works well for movies such as 'the Life of Pi', it really undermines the military scenes. The physical or even verbal fights with civilians could not have broken out under the circumstances in the film, either. Those are just two of the more obvious problems.There are many important topics which were touched upon; however, the delivery, again, is underwhelming. The problem with the rather risky strategy narrating the story purely through interweaving memory flashbacks and reality is that it is hard for the audience to build emotion connection with the characters and develop thoughts on topics. However, the film is inherently difficult to shoot due to the very limited substance in the combat experience of the protagonist. It is realistic, as the combat today is mostly fought in skirmishes. The film could just as easily become bland using more conventional approach.With that said, the film overall matches my personal experience in military- when inside, I often thought about my civilian life, but once I was out, I felt 'foreign' and had frequent memory flashbacks of the my military experiences. I think the film captures that pretty well. I also thought that the film, as a tradition of Ang Lee perhaps, does not intend to deliver any message, but rather, focuses on the human side of the characters without passing judgment. His films can be quite philosophical. This is why I think the analysis focusing on 'the message' or 'the story line' is missing the point.Overall, I think Ang Lee was quite ambitious, using an unorthodox way to narrate and new equipment to film a story that might be difficult to resonate with many of the viewers, and could easily draw critique from the military and veteran communities. I respect him for pushing boundaries. It was also a high quality production in many ways. However, I do think that this film has unfortunately left much to be desired."
" feeling fake
",-0.3818,-0.9786,2017-11-24 00:00:00,6,"The war in Iraq is not going well and support for the war is fading. Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn) is a 19 year old soldier from Texas. He is caught on camera in a heroic but failed attempt to save his sergeant Shroom Breem (Vin Diesel). He and his squad are brought back to America to do a hero's tour. Promoter Albert (Chris Tucker) is trying to sell their story for a Hollywood movie. Norm Oglesby (Steve Martin) is the war-supporting Dallas football team owner. He has invited the boys to join the patriotic halftime show. Billy falls for cheerleader Faison Zorn (Makenzie Leigh). In flashbacks, he spends time with his family and his older sister Kathryn (Kristen Stewart). The family is in medical debt after she suffered severe injuries. Her fianc√©e abandoned her due to her disfigurement which led to Billy vandalizing his car. In order to escape prosecution, he joined the Army. Anti-war Kathryn is guilt-ridden and desperate for Billy to leave the fighting.I can see compelling aspects of Flags of Our Fathers within this Ang Lee movie. First of all, casting newcomer Joe Alwyn has its appeal and accompanying pitfalls. He has that ah-schucks All-American heroism but his lack of star power makes him blend in with the rest of the squad. Lee fails to alleviate that by filming him by himself. He only stands out when he first gets together with his sister Kathryn. I really like their chemistry. The risk caused some problem but ends up with a good payoff. It could have been handled better.The other casting problem is Steve Martin. He doesn't fit this character. It's very fake and the fake Dallas Cowboys do not help. The fakeness devalues the serious message of the movie. They even have the fake Destiny's Child. It infects other aspects of the surrounding story. The clash with the roadies and the halftime PTSD could have been more visceral but everything is off. It's not quite real.There is also Lee's use of high frame rate. It doesn't look bad on DVD but I understand some complained about the theatrical viewing. There may be a powerful journey in the source material but the movie is off and it only achieves greatness in short little bursts. This is a misstep by award winning Lee."
" Thought provoking and enjoyable but falls well short of being a great film
",0.8705,-0.5499,2017-10-24 00:00:00,7,A young soldier returns after the Iraq war lauded as a hero. But is he? Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is not the stereotypical war film but more a study of how war affects everyone at home and on the battlefield. In particular how the realities of war are far different to what those not there are told. This is fairly slow moving and probably lacks a real star performance to carry it through. Saying that I thought Joe Alwyn ( looking a lot like a young Matt Damon)did a pretty good job in the lead role. It's told in flashbacks which work pretty well. This is an intelligent war film but won't appeal to the shoot em up brigade. It raises plenty of questions about crass the war is perceived and portrayed in America. This is an enjoyable film with lots of messages but it doesn't quite hit the mark enough to be labelled a great film.
" Style trumps substance in Billy Lynn
",0.0,0.9555,2017-09-20 00:00:00,6,"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a clean, colorful, and vibrant movie about the disconnect between war and the home front, fantasy and reality, but trips up in the execution. Its much-praised frame rate of 120 frames per second (twice the previous record) isn't really justified by the film's simplistic plot, and in some ways it looked like a film school project. Its stereotypical portrayal of soldiers undermines what it gets right about the relationship between soldiers and civilians. Overall, it's entertaining enough to watch but not something you'll come back to again and again.Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is based on a novel of the same name by Ben Fountain, a 58-year-old writer from North Carolina. I haven't read the book, so I can't comment about it in relation to the film. While I was watching the movie, however, I couldn't shake the suspicion that this story wasn't written by either a former soldier or someone who served in the Iraq War.""This is what a Hollywood screenwriter thinks soldiers sound like,"" I thought as I listened to the dialogue. Turns out my suspicions were correct, which explains why the soldiers were so painfully stereotypical. A writer often falls back on stereotypes or popular tropes when not informed by personal experience.The film's portrayal of the disconnect between soldiers and civilians, however, is very insightful. It's hard to describe the oddity of being involved in something like the military, especially if you have been deployed in a war zone. Everyone has an opinion about it, even though they have no direct knowledge or experience. Even comments from someone who supports the troops and the war effort can seem awkward and embarrassing, and this film captures that beautifully.Throughout the film, civilians approach members of ""Bravo Squad"" to ask questions or make comments, and the encounters inevitably turn painful as it's revealed the civilians are clueless about the soldiers' motivations and experiences. It becomes clear the pageantry and praise for the soldiers is more about the civilians' own feelings than it is honoring the soldiers' bravery under fire.Norm Oglesby (Steve Martin) comes closest to an antagonist in Billy Lynn. Oglesby is the fictional owner of the Dallas Cowboys who agrees to finance a movie about Bravo Squad's experiences in Iraq. What he offers to option the movie, however, is much less than what the squad expected to receive. After a brief argument, Billy Lynn and SGT David Dime (Garrett Hedlund) turn down his offer.Billy then has to decide whether to leave with his sister and go AWOL, or return with his squad, who will inevitably be redeployed to Iraq. He decides to stay with his squad. Then, in a twist ending, it's implied he was shot and killed in Iraq, and the whole movie had been a fantasy in his dying mind of what it would be like to go home a hero (kinda shitty, actually).Overall, the technical aspects of Billy Lynn were not as much an asset as advertised. While filming at 120 frames per second offers finer quality and detail, and I appreciated the movie's bright, vibrant colors, it's difficult to justify its high frame rate. Only a handful of theaters on earth are capable of showing it at its highest quality.Apparently in order to film at this frame rate, the director couldn't afford to do multiple takes. Sacrificing ""getting a scene right"" in order to film at a frame rate higher than most theaters can even project doesn't make sense.In one flashback, Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn) and his sister, Kathryn (Kristen Stewart), catch up at home. The scene is shot in over-the-shoulder perspective. When Billy speaks, the camera focuses on him and blurs out Kathryn. When Kathryn speaks, the camera focuses on her and blurs out Billy. It goes back and forth for the whole dialog. Simplistic scenes like that, combined with settling for the first or second take, makes Billy Lynn look like a student film.Despite these deficiencies, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk was visually impressive and featured decent performances by veteran actors Vin Diesel and Chris Tucker. Arturo Castro, who got his start in short films and plays SPC ""Mango"" Montoya, was a bright spot among an otherwise lackluster cast. Overall, Billy Lynn is worth seeing, but not on par with Iraq War films like Green Zone (2010) and American Sniper (2014)."

Through flashbacks the film shows what really happened to his squad - contrasting the realities of war with America's perceptions.The biggest problem with 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' is its unappealing Writing. Jean-Christophe Castelli's Screenplay, which is based on the novel by the same name by Ben Fountain, trembles. Billy Lynn's struggle in the war zone & the after effects once he returns home, are barely engaging. The Writing doesn't hold you or move, unfortunately! Ang Lee isn't in form this time around. His Direction leaves a lot to be desired. Cinematography & Editing are fine. Art & Costume Design are classy.Performance-Wise: Joe Alwyn as Billy Lynn, is the sole saving grace. He delivers an excellent performance from start to end. He has the potential to go places, given the right scripts. Kristen Stewart as Billy's older sister, tries to make the most out of her limited role. Chris Tucker is okay, while Steve Martin is wasted. And Vin Diesel is as usual.

But, like all of us, they will take what praise and thanks they can get. Perhaps what was good about the film is that it didn't have a strong point, but rather show a more realistic view that life isn't one sided, and people will do what they are driven to do for better or worse.Good job by Kristen Stewart who I normally rag on in my reviews.Guide: F-word.

Ever since we started with the Independence War, we've entered numerous wars without learning any lessons from our past wars. History tends to repeat itself, especially when we as a nation are not even aware of our own history. The current wars that we are engaging are the direct results of old men with hidden agenda sending their young ones into hell while making political and business deals in order to keep themselves in power,at the same time enriching their friends.In wars, there are no heroes... rather, just ordinary men trying to stay alive while taking care of each others. Ask any Medal of Honor recipient. In the White House, there are no patriots... rather, just old men trying to stay in power while taking care of their friends.

All the discussion about it surrounds the technology used in making it, and that's necessary, but it's not the whole story -- nor is it NOT the story as others would have you believe. The simple fact is that this is a well-acted and at times completely engrossing anti-war picture, one that is more often than not, yes, let down by some of the failings of trying to show off the tech. Some scenes come across as incredibly ""stage-y"" for lack of a better word, and the lighting can be overlit fluorescent too often (like a docudrama).However, that being said, I did have the pleasure of actually being able to see this on 3D bluray and I must say it's absolutely the most stunning 3D I think I've ever seen. There's an incredible amount of depth to so many scenes -- sometimes it's showy, but sometimes it's in service of the story like when Billy comes home and the entrance hallway seems to stretch on forever out in front of him, inviting him in to its embrace but also providing a dark trap. The essential conundrum, the doublethink, at the center of his inner workings."
" Ang Lee wrings some thought-provoking ideas and visual compulsion, but they are not enough to compete with its lack of emotional touch
",-0.2617,0.9127,2017-07-03 00:00:00,5,"The politics of war are incredibly complex, and the human cost is disturbingly high. There are no wonder why those who give up their lives to fight oversea are honored with great dignity. But the big question in this war drama directed by Oscar Winner Ang Lee is: Are we honoring these soldiers the right way? That is an idea that this film takes a dive in, but not with enough impact. Lee's approach to the absorbing topic is too shallow of emotional touch. The greatest accolade Lee acquires in this picture is allowing it to shine with a unique visual innovation, and that is shooting the film with an unheard-of frame rate of 120 FPS to capture the immense atmosphere of the war sequences. It is a technological achievement that powerfully shows how far Hollywood has advanced in technological. Seeing this movie at a theater with an unusual frame rate that high is an alarmingly tough get as there are only six theaters around the globe that include this, with only two of these theaters planted in the United States. Set in 2004, this follows 19-year old Billy Lynn (played by Joe Alwyn), an Army specialist returning home from active duty in Iraq with his fellow squad members. On the day of a Thanksgiving home game at the Dallas Cowboys stadium, Billy, honored as a hero for his duty, and his squad members are brought together on a victory tour during the halftime show. During the tour, Billy is hit with flashbacks of the tragedies that occurred during the battle in Iraq including the death of his friend Staff Sergeant Shroom (played by Vin Diesel) as opposed to the American citizens fantasized perceptions of what they think happened over there. Along the way, he finds his heroism manipulated by film producers Norm (played by Steve Martin) and Albert (played by Chris Tucker) who are trying to land a movie deal out of the events that squadron's faced.Based on the novel by Ben Fountain, this drama capitalizes on themes of patriotism and honor, and opens light on social issues that run between the grim realities of war and the distorted views of active combat by citizens back at home. The primary concern here deals with home civilians including the media exploiting the heroism soldiers acquire during active duty overseas, simply for our own personal gain. As disconcerting as it is, one thing this film proves is that unless you have been in active combat, you have little or no idea of what it is realistically feels like being in active combat overseas. Director Ang Lee makes an engaging point out of this concept. But alongside, the film also introduces these contradictions on how soldiers are celebrated by citizens for their active duty, yet people all over America continue to disdain war as an unnecessary bargain; an idea that the story never fully explores. From there on, the story slips into a jumbled mess and offers little emotional touch to the point where viewers are left with no impact. The film's emotional highpoints stand during the flashbacks of the title character and his squad fighting in Iraq which are powerfully shot and executed in authenticity. It's too bad that these scenes only make up a small portion of the near-two- hour runtime, while the majority the picture follows Billy and his squadron walking through the stadium during the halftime show with Destiny's Child performing and fireworks going off. If this manages to wring anything out of the story's framework other than its absorbing ideas, it is the performances, particularly Joe Alwyn as Billy and Kristen Stewart as his older sister, given the opportunity to flex her acting muscles. The rest of the cast offer some good on screen presences, operating with a sense of cynicism and humility. Looking for something Oscar- worthy though, you are probably better off looking elsewhere.Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a shallow war drama that fails to arrest viewers with its timely themes and Ang Lee's scattershot approach to an otherwise thoughtful examination of its eponymous character versus America's fantasized perceptions of war. Although the final product is disappointingly forgettable, some may admire Ang Lee's effort on embracing the film with his visual innovation. However, its a technological effort that is too early to introduce in major theaters at this point."

",0.4753,0.9969,2017-06-14 00:00:00,7,"After giving the career best, the director Ang Lee returned with this which is quite a long gap for him between the films. He has fallen back to the average, like usual whenever he gives a masterpiece. Most directors do that. This film was adapted from the book of the same name. It was not a full fledged war film. It has soldiers, but one day event theme where they are on the short break to homeland to participate in the felicitation programme for their victory.The story closely focused on the young soldier, Billy, Lynn. He was the centre of the event, a war hero. During his stay, he recalls the original event. What really happened and what else he could have done. Apart from that, enjoying the day with a game from the stadium, dance, musics and many more. Meeting family has a sub-plot that reveals about his choice to join the army. Overall, a memorable day with happy and sad incidents.So my first thought in the initial stage was like it is another film similar to the 2009's 'The Messenger'. No, it was not. It was completely different than anything I've seen so far. Refreshing, but not captivating. If you are okay with simple, yet want a feel strong, this is it. It is kind of like mixed result film. Great casting and strong performances. Wonderful debute for the lead actor.On the other side, mix of colourful, full of music, emotional, romantic, thrilling presentation. A bit Americanised, like the film events and the patriotism. So, a much better suitable film for the domestic audience than the rest of the world, perhaps excluding western world. Even though, watching it once is no harm or not bad.7/10"

When the danger is everywhere, the only thing that we can do is trying our best not to be killed by the enemy. In this film, we can also notice that the Americans don't really understand what they do. Everyone has his own point of view of their identity. For some people, they are the hero of America; for the film producer, they are just ""idea"" or ""story""; and for the dancers in the scene of Beyonc√©, they are noting.

" A walk not worth taking
",-0.1695,-0.6422,2017-05-30 00:00:00,3,"For a film made by one of the modern era's greatest story-tellers, Billy Lynn's Long Half Time Walk is an incredibly disappointing film.That for all its so called technical wizardry (the film was shot at the highest ever feature film frame rate) the film seemed to have forgotten how to tell its rather simple, yet over-stuffed story that's filled with some of last year's most cringe-worthy snippets of dialogue.It's really hard to fathom just what director Ang Lee was thinking here.Coming away from one of his biggest successes in the form of the artistically stunning Life of Pi and previous hits such as Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you'd expect a lot more from Ang Lee, and in adapting Ben Fountain's well-received book of the same name, it seemed as though Billy Lynn really could've been one of those big commercial drama hits that also plays extremely well to the awards crowd.The finished product is anything but however, as this emotion free affair, that sometimes does look awfully pretty (in an odd artificial-like way) fails to make us care one little bit about newcomer Joe Alwyn's Billy Lynn and his crew of fellow American soldiers and as the title suggests this really does become a loooong walk (more for us than anyone else) as Lee's film goes from barely interesting scene to less interesting scene as we partake in a series of meet and greets and war flashbacks that never feel like they're threatening to become anything more than sporadically engaging.You get where Lee and his team were trying to go, a darkly funny and sometimes downright sad look at the way in which war shapes people's lives but when the film we get is filled with such average dialogue, cookie cutter characters including Steve Martin's do-gooder football team owner Norm and Chris Tucker's loud-mouthed agent Albert and one of the dumbest romantic side plots we've seen in sometime, there's really no wonder as to why this film was a huge bomb upon initial release.Final Say ‚Äì A good example showing off that wiz-bang new technology or so-called technological advancements don't make a good movie, Billy Lynn is an unengaging experience that fails to capture our hearts of imaginations and while there are the odd sprinklings of decent moments within this forgettable walk, you expect a lot more from the likes of Ang Lee.1 ¬Ω angry roadies out of 5"

From the opening scenes to whenever we petered out and turned it off, this film feels false. The platoon doesn't feel like young men who've lived and fought together. They seem like actors who have never crossed paths with people who make up our military these days. That may not be the case but that's what it feels like to someone who ...also doesn't cross paths with soldiers often. And maybe that's what's wrong with movie. Fountain's point is the disconnect between Americans and the warriors they send off to do battle for them.

",0.0,0.6384,2017-05-09 00:00:00,4,"First, the photography in this, having the camera bounce back and forth from 3d person to first person views, really made the story hard to watch as it kept changing perspectives in the worst times, too frequently, and in a way that made everyone looking at the camera (even GREAT actors like Steve Martin) look like they were really straining to get through the script.So, the script - the idea of the soldiers touring the nation on a public affairs trips to get support for the overseas war, isn't a bad idea. BUT this focused way too much on the soldiers' trying to SELL their story to Hollywood and others, so they can make a movie based on them and each of the soldiers get money.This movie is supposed to be about the internal struggles going on with Billy, but the script really went far off base from that and just has you all over the place, mostly focusing on the soldiers trying to make money off of their military service, the troops' sergeant that is really REALLY over-acting in trying to act like their sergeant and negotiator for more money for them all, and only a little bit focusing on Billy and his mental struggles.The struggles are highlighted a LITTLE, very fragmented throughout the movie, with bouncing us between present day on their publicity tour and to the past with fragments of his deployment and coming home with a family that is worried about him and a sister, played by an actress that STILL cannot seem to every find an ounce of emotion to project, trying to convince him to go AWOL, just to get some Mental Health help. But again - the movie is MORE about these guys making money off of their story sold to the movies...A 4 rating was generous, I think, and only because I recognize the ATTEMPT to tell a story about one of our troops coming home and facing internal struggle - but really, if I wanted to rate the movie based on what it was supposed to be about - it would be a big zero. POORLY done, nightmare photography skills, really really bad script and acting and fragmented script bouncing between many segments of the story with a WAY OVER THE TOP, unreal cheesy and very unrealistic ending that would made every one of us Veterans looking at it and all saying, ""Oh please....!"" and being disgusted by the entire time just wasted watching this."

",0.5574,0.4746,2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Dubai International Film Festival Gala Screening December 8, 2016.Much expected movie from Ang Lee.The movie experiments with 125 frames per second shooting. The movie Saving Private Ryan has experimented with higher shutter speed to get the real war feeling. But, 125 frames per second had any impact on the audience? I was searching for the difference in the theater.The film involves many aspects of a soldier. He is honored for the most terrible experience of his life.The past scenes of the soldier at the war field is recollected on his journey to the the honoring ceremony. His family, a sister who was badly injured in an accident, but lives with scars compels him to quit this job and join the family. He falls in affection with a girl he meets on the ceremony. The ceremony was not as sweet as they expected. Unfavorable situations hit the soldiers.The movie is a collage of all these emotions. Definitely not the best of Ang Lee, but a movie watchable as you like it. The signature of Ang Lee can be seen in a few scenes. Reference of Vin Diesel to the Hindu mythology was interesting.The movie has good star cast, but Ang Lee made the stars subtle without shining. He made the stars suitable for the character.There is a clich√© of glorified act. The world police force America kicked to open the doors of a sleeping family with kids and ladies, then arrests a man. Soldiers invade another country and the soldiers sufferings are glorified, as usual in all the American films.#KiduMovie"
" Not Actually A War Movie
",0.4847,0.9639,2017-03-19 00:00:00,9,"This will be short and to the point. Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is not a ""war movie"". It is not a propaganda picture about American Imperialism, it is not a recruitment poster, and it is most certainly not an action movie. War, in all its complexity, is incidental to this film. Billy Lynn just happens to be a soldier and the events that kick off the film happened at war. This is a film about labels.From the moment Billy is labeled a ""hero"" by the press for doing something he didn't have time to think about, his life is consumed. He comes a symbol to everyone he meets, even those who are supposed to love and know him best. To the Army, he becomes a recruitment tool. They send him on tour to be the Face of the War despite accomplishing nothing more than anyone else in his unit.To Hollywood, he becomes a character. A fiction to be utilized in winning more accolades for people who already have plenty of it.To his admirers, he becomes a ""hero"". A walking uniform onto whom one can pin all their unfulfilled aspirations and unrealistic expectations. One whose hand they can shake and be freed of all responsibility.To his sister, he becomes a victim. An unwilling pawn of an unjust war, no matter how he himself feels about it.To everyone, Billy Lynn becomes everything except Billy Lynn. The flesh and blood and memories of the person disappears into the mystique of heroism, until the only people left who still see it are his fellow soldiers. And the only place left where he isn't a symbol, the war.This is not a war movie. If that is what you are expecting, don't see it."

" Another solid addition to the career of everybody involved here
",0.1531,0.9983,2017-03-16 00:00:00,6,"""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" is a co-production between America, Britain and China and the latter is probably because the director here is 2-time Academy Award winner Ang Lee. This is the man's newest work. No need to elaborate further on him as most people certainly now ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Life of Pi"" or some of his other works. With this film here that runs for slightly under 2 hours, he gives us his take on war-themed movies as the Iraq War is a huge topic in here. But still I must say, it was a good watch for me, even if sometimes war films do not have the greatest impact on me. The reason may be that there are other maybe more important plots in here that made it pretty interesting for me, for example the protagonist's background back home. For lead actor Joe Alwyn this was the very first career performance for him and we will see what he can make of it in the long run. Playing the title character in an Ang Lee movie is a really big thing though. And for screenplay writer Jean-Christophe Castelli, who adapted the Ben Fountain novel here, it was also the first effort as a writer. For that it was pretty solid, but of course he worked with Lee on many other occasions too.Now for the film itself. It had some really good moments, like the scene of the desperate fight and the death of Vin Diesel's character (wait what? how isn't he unkillable? he is Vin f***ing Diesel no). But my favorite scene was still the one with the soldiers at the halftime show and how they stand there and how we see them while listening to Destiny's Child's song ""Soldier"". It really includes all the absurdity one could imagine, with what these men have been through and how the general public sees them. Many people have respect probably, but very few understand what they have been through and the scenes with the security staff are the perfect example of that. As a huge Kristen Stewart fan, I was also happy to see her in here and I think she played her role very well, even if the illness aspect was probably not as effective as it could have been with the monetary references about her treatments. It was still nice to have her in here, even if people who don't like her (and God knows there are many) will probably not be convinced by what they are getting in here.In general, I would not say that this is an actors' movie (despite the inclusions of known names like Hedlund, Tucker or Martin), but it is much more of a scenario movie if you know what I mean. It's about the stark contrast between war and life in the United States, maybe even taking the geographic component into account. And while I would not say that this is anywhere near my very favorites from 2016 I believe that, as I wrote in the title, it's a pretty good work by Ang Lee again, and everybody else who worked on it. The scene with the DC song I mentioned earlier is a contender for best 5 scenes of 2016 for sure because there is so much you can feel during it and write about it. There are some weaknesses with the film too, but nothing really really bad. I personally would have preferred a bit more chronology actually, but that is just personal perception and taste. The good definitely outweighs the taste and I recommend this film to anybody because of its amazing contemporary value. See it."

" 'The bullet's already been fired'
",-0.5574,0.8906,2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Ben Johnson's novel has been exceptionally well adapted for the screen by Jean- Christophe Castelli and directed with the expected sensitivity of Ang Lee. It is a kick in the gut for those who see it ‚Äì an anti-war statement placed in front of us as the never- ending wars in the Middle East continue to fester and destroy lives on all sides of the war zone and beyond. But it is also a biting statement about the time in which we live, a time when entertainment and gross spending of money is directed toward the insatiable appetite for big shows and stars and shallow moments of pleasure that appear to obsess us. The manner in which returning soldiers face 'instant glory' is overshadowed by the inherent bully-ism by a public that does not understand the cancer of war and how it metastasizes throughout our troubled planet.The film is told from the point of view of 19-year-old private Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn) who, along with his fellow soldiers in Bravo Squad (Garrett Hedlund, Arturo Castro, Mason Lee, Astro, Beau Knapp, Ismael Cruz Cordova, Barney Harris and Vin Diesel) becomes a hero after a harrowing Iraq battle and is brought home temporarily for a victory tour. Through flashbacks, culminating at the spectacular halftime show of the Thanksgiving Day football game in Dallas, Texas, the film reveals what really happened to the squad - contrasting the realities of the war with America's perceptions. Billy's family's response to his Silver Star heroism is conflicted with Billy's damaged sister Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) who pleads with Billy not to return for another tour in Iraq. Billy finds a possible entry to fame through a film about Bravo by Albert (Chris Tucker), thwarted by the wealthy insensitive would-be backer Norm (Steve Martin), an introduction to love by one of the Dallas cheerleaders Faison (Makenzie Leigh), and in the end, though disenchanted with America's reaction to what soldiers suffer in war zones, Billy makes the 'long halftime walk' back to his beloved buddies of Bravo as they prepare to return to duty. The film seems all glitter on the surface until the inserted flashbacks of the realities of war in Iraq ‚Äì a factor that makes the film even more poignant as an anti-war statement. This is a strong film that will move sensitive viewers ‚Äì hopefully to action."

",-0.5413,0.6783,2017-02-24 00:00:00,6,"'BILLY LYNN'S LONG HALFTIME WALK': Three Stars (Out of Five)Director Ang Lee's new Iraqi war drama, based on the book (of the same name) by Ben Fountain. The movie was scripted by first time screenwriter Jean-Christophe Castelli, who also served as an associate producer on Lee's 2012 hit 'LIFE OF PIE'. It stars Joe Alwyn, Kristen Stewart, Garrett Hedlund, Chris Tucker, Vin Diesel, Makenzie Leigh and Steve Martin. The film tells the story of a 19- year-old Army specialist, and his unit, who become National celebrities after a heroic act is caught on camera. They do a publicity tour, which ends in a Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving halftime show. The movie was shot at a projection frame rate of 120 frames per second, in 3D at 4K HD resolution (which had never been done before). It's received mixed (to negative) reviews from critics, and it also bombed at the Box Office. For an Ang Lee movie, I found it to be severely disappointing (but not without it's moments). Billy Lynn is a 19-year-old from Texas, who was forced to join the army after an act of violence defending his sister, Kathryn (Stewart). Kathryn feels guilty about this, and she desperately wants to get him honorably discharged from service (on grounds of PTSD). Billy is now a National hero, after he was caught on camera heroically trying to rescue his late Sergeant (Diesel). Now his entire squad is famous, and they're in talks for a movie deal, as well as doing a major publicity tour (which ends at the Dallas Cowboys halftime show).The film has some good scenes in it; and some great insight into the Iraqi war, and the effects it had on the soldiers involved (as well as their loved ones at home). There's some controversial politics in it too, representing both sides of the issues. Stewart and Diesel also both give decent performances in the movie. With all that said, it's still poorly written at times (and shockingly poorly directed). I really didn't care for the experimental frame rate either, it's more distracting than anything else. At times the movie does feel kind of cheesy as well, because of these issues, but at other times it does also have some important things to say. It's not a bad film, but it's not a good one either; and it's especially disappointing coming from Ang Lee.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY"
" Curious, but deeply flawed
",0.1655,0.409,2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"I did not watch this film with preconceptions, and I watched it on a perfectly normal television. So any particular technological advances meant very little me. It's story was so-so. I never got bored, but then I wasn't expecting an action film. The acting fine. I don't really see how someone can give this a 1/10 or call it the worst this year, or even this month. There could have been more to it, but it almost felt like a biopic to me, and erring on the side of conservatism. The events were not huge, escalated, Brian Lynn did not kill Osama Bin Laden, there was no sex scene with a cheerleader... The film appeared very 'dry' visually, the clarity I understand now in some part due to Lee's filming at a high frame rate, and resolution. Throughout I drew comparison's to the works of Brian De Palma. Characters would often stand front on to the camera, talking to the camera as if it were the subject in their conversation, and I wonder if this was chosen to foreground the detail, or the 3D in which it was presented in many cinemas, or make the whole thing more 'real' for us the viewers. It felt unreal to me, like those films where they film in a first person. 3D is still very much a gimmick, one that distracts from all but the spectacle in films, weakening dramas when shown in 3D, and everything when presented in 2D. If it's to really go beyond that it needs to be something you either show in 3D, or not at all."
" Tries to be stunning with the visual aspect but very disappointing.
",-0.6046,-0.9924,2017-02-19 00:00:00,4,"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a war drama that could have been so much more as a movie. It tries to be an emotional moving picture about a young army specialist Billy (Joe Alwyn) after a battle in Iraq that left him emotionally scarred from losing one of his own and from taking a life. Being home, he is conflicted with the images of war that is preventing him on trying to live a normal life. His sister Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) is trying to convince him to stay or see a doctor that can diagnose him for the trauma. While, his Sgt Dime (Garrett Hedlund) is trying to get them prepped to going back to Iraq after their thanksgiving football tour with a halftime walk during the Destiny Child's concert. The pro about the film, I am surprised to see Joe Alwyn delivering a semi decent performance as Billy Lynn. The way his character is trying to have a good time with his squad during the football event. But at the same time, he is struggling within. Even from his facial expressions, knowing that he is not entirely in peace. Being a first time on screen with this actor, I will say he did well for his first role on film. The con about the movie, I am disappointed with this film overall. Especially, being an Ang Lee film, I was expecting a little bit more from his direction. He tended to focus on delivering an impressive quality on the technical part of his filmmaking by shooting in 4k. With this film and setting, I felt like this was not as noticeable or worth talking about except it being clear and making these characters feel like a cut out cardboard. The narrative structure of the film was all over the place and the pacing was incoherent. Which made it difficult to have emotions for these characters, even though it was suppose to have those feelings. Made the movie overall very boring. Lets talk about the dull subplots, with movie studio producer Albert (Chris Tucker) trying to get the rights from Billy and his squad to make a movie about them and their bravery mission. I also thought the action sequence with Billy and his squad fighting in a battle had some terrible editing and direction. Billy Lynn is a war drama film that shows the struggles with PTSD and going back to war but Ang Lee's direction was so dull and disappointing. The film is very forgettable. Sad to say, because Joe Alwyn and the rest of the cast are talented but the script was all over the place with the halftime show, Billy's visit with the family, and his time in Iraq. I would not recommend it."

However, to me, this film is not about anti-war at all, it is showing how diverse and away from truth our opinions can be about something we've never been through, from the beginning of the movie when Albert the producer was talking on the phone, to the cut scenes when those football fans came to Billy and express how grateful they are of Billy's service, to the ""war room"" when Mr.Oglesby was just trying to buy the story at a humiliatingly low price, and many more... Faison the cheerleader, my heart's broken, along with Billy's, when I saw her response to Billy's ""I'd just about run away with you."" She doesn't love Billy Lynn the person, she just loves a fictional national hero imagined by herself, so she hopes Billy to return to the battlefield and probably become a greater hero, she doesn't care about Billy's life. In sharp contrast, when Kathryn was frustrated by Billy's decision to return to the battlefield, I was deeply moved. They hugged, like Billy and Faison did, but the two female characters are absolutely distinct. One looks forward to her admired hero fighting in a bloodbath, another worries about her younger brother taking any type of damage, both physically and mentally. This scene reminds me that how important our family is to us. Overall, I think this is a good movie just because it does affect me in a positive way."

My only complaint is that they use soldiers to protest the war, when in fact- most of us are proud of our service there. I did three tours of combat duty in Iraq (Ramadi, TQ, and Q-West) and none of them are anywhere near this movie's portrayal.

" Walk of Shame
",-0.4767,-0.9828,2017-02-10 00:00:00,4,"This review of Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is spoiler free** (2/5)ANG LEE IS one of those filmmakers who can make films from even the simplest of subjects, such as, a couple of homosexual cowboys (Brokeback Mountain), or a young man surviving on a rowboat with a fully-grown Bengal tiger (Life of Pi), that then become awards gold. This over the last decade made him one of the most watched directors of all time - you'd think that crafting a film from one of Ben Fountain's award winning novels would be easy for a veteran director. Unfortunately as ambitious as it is, being shot in 3D with a rate of 120fps (five times higher than the average frame rate) a lot higher than The Hobbit's 48fps, that's one of the problems ‚Äì it's ludicrously fast. The adaptation already has a big problem. The story focuses on the life of 19-year-old Billy Lynn (newcomer Joe Alwyn) it's told in the form of a first person perspective, he has just come home from the brutal combat in Iraq with Team Bravo who have a tour of the United States ending at Dallas' football stadium where they will be presented as heroes in front of a huge crowd. Naturally, Lee keeps us waiting for the walk across the pitch at the spectacular halftime show; while we wait there are a series of rich flashbacks ‚Äì telling the tragic memories of this young man fighting in Iraq with his regiment in each of these flashbacks and there are a lot of them we witness how the fight changed him. Everyone is worried about him, not just his comrades but his family too, his sister (Stewart) thinks that he might be suffering from PTSD ‚Äì perhaps he may flip at any moment. Though the main problem isn't the quality of the film because whenever Lee finishes a film it will always have his sticker of approval wrapped all over it, it's the content that's the main problem, there is either a lot of if or barely any there is no middle ground the film loses its footing at the start, but as the story goes on it never really finds it's footing again. Not only that, it's almost too hard to focus on just one thing whether we go from Billy having a meeting in the stadium's conference room, through talking to the sergeant of his regiment (Vin Diesel in a wasted role), to him fighting some of the Iraqi soldiers sure, it's an engaging war film for the most part but then we are transported back to the stadium. The problems mount up and at 120fps the problems are noticeable. It's ambitious, granted, but not needed in a film like this. Towards the end as we walk alongside Billy toward the halftime podium, it's here when he will get to stand on stage and do nothing at all no matter what is going on. It's also here when the film will seek sentimentality, by a final flashback where they have to fight back. But sentimentality has to be earned and it isn't earned here. Sure enough Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a harrowing war film in some moments but it's horribly bombarded by modernity of the camera-work with the confusing story, there is perhaps a better film somewhere in the editing room because it certainly isn't here.VERDICT: A clunky war film with ill-managed modernity a confusing plot that never really finds its footing along with some shaky camera-work that can't dazzle over its poorly executed story. It's a rare misstep for the Oscar winning director."

Billy is decorated for his act of heroism and his platoon is brought home from Iraq to travel the USA to garner support for the war. They have a publicist who is trying to get a movie deal about their heroics and an NFL team owner is interested in financing the movie.The soldiers are due to make an appearance during the halftime show of a Thanksgiving Day NFL game in Dallas where Destiny's Child are the headline act and then return to Iraq. It is clear Lynn is suffering with PTSD, his sister does not want him going back to fight and during this final appearance he gets friendly with a cheerleader.The film was a plodding boring dirge, a surprise given that it was directed by two time best director Oscar winner, Ang Lee.A lot of the story is told in flashbacks but it badly hampers the pacing of the film. It has an uneven rhythm. It is less of a war movie, not even an examination of soldiers feeling the trauma of war but a belated satire on the commercialization of war. Billy Lynn is no even that interesting, even his heroism is rather questionable, he just killed a man who went for him and you think is that all? At least he gets a bit of romance at the end but the film really has no focus.The post 2003 Iraq war films have underwhelmed. It really needs a story told by someone with purpose just as with the Vietnam war films where Oliver Stone, a combat veteran who served in Vietnam finally managed to tell a story with passion, depth that was both action packed but also had a personal journey. We are at the moment a long way off that."

On the last day of their ""vacation"" in the U.S. before being shipped back to the war, Alwyn's experiences in Iraq and his first days of coming home are told in flashbacks. He clearly suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, and he finds a way out of going back into combat duty thanks to his loving and tenacious sister played by Kristen Stewart. But he must make a tough decision whether to take care of himself and take the way out, or take care of his squadmates and go back into combat with them.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" is the scene when a civilian starts making fun of soldiers during a football game. One of Alwyn's squadmates puts the loudmouth in a sleeper hold, silencing his big mouth in seconds.Ang Lee does a great job with ""BLLHW,"" focusing on Alwyn and allowing the audience to see what this soldier has seen and what he is thinking. I especially enjoyed the unpredictable nature of this movie, as it could have gone in so many clich√©d routes in the third act under the guidance of untalented directors/producers/writers; but the filmmakers chose to take the road less travelled, and produced a relatively quiet ending that is still emotionally powerful.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Cheesy and Boring
",-0.3182,-0.9711,2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"First of this is not an action movie. I don't know who the target audience this film was aiming for, males, females, age but they failed miserably on all accounts. This a movie about a soldier coming home and dealing with family, society, etc. while recalling past events. The problem is how poorly it is done. This movie is so bad it looks like it's supposed to be a parody of another movie. Some scenes are so bad i was unsure if they were suppose to be funny or serious. From the filming to the just how bad the dialogue is in this movie just seems so cheep. Majority of the movie consist of pointless conversations that having no relevance to anything. Chris Tucker is in the film but he is on the phone 95% of the time. I would highly recommend everyone missing this pooper. If you do watch this film, when they are marching at halftime look and how funny the guy on the far left is marching, it's comical. Also, I've never seen anyone, EVER, fall in love with each other in a span of one hour."
" A reflection on war
",-0.5994,0.9489,2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Billy comes home for two weeks during Iraq War,and his platoon ""Bravo"" is paraded everywhere to show America what true heroes are. I can safely say this without any spoilers. The movie is not out and out a war movie, or anti-war movie, rather it's a discourse on life in the time of war. How families are affected,how priorities change, how war changes the person in and out. I think Joe Alwyn and Garrett Hedlund did a fine job. In his brief role, Vin Diesel quotes Lord Krishna, ""Avatar of the supreme deity Vishnu."" Then he gives a transcendent smile and it evokes a scene from the great epic Mahabharata. It also sets the tone of the movie pivoting around the oft used phrase ""The bullet has already been fired."" to which Billy replies ""I am ready,Sarge.""The movie also diligently sketches out how the people in general see the war and treats its heroes. But only the soldiers know how thin the lines are drawn in war-between heroism and sacrilege. Thank you Mr.Ang Lee,for such a mature work."
" so bad
",-0.5849,-0.5856,2017-01-31 00:00:00,1,"I was so disappointed with this film after anticipating its realise for so long.The film feels a lot more like a comedy/goof film rather than the serious film it should be given the topic.I was hoping for more of an action packed film but instead the film is so slow.Also, it doesn't even go anywhere or give any new information from what we already know from the trailer. One of the main reasons why I watched the film in the first place was because I am a huge vin diesel fan but he isn't even in it much! Most of the scenes are completely meaningless and boring and don't add any energy into the film."
" Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (2016)
",0.0,0.2602,2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Ang Lee takes four years to bring forth his followup to Life of Pi. I thought Life of Pi was phenomenal. it was a stunning visual experience and through creative storytelling we got a really memorable film. When I saw the trailer for Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk I wasn't very impressed because I couldn't really discern what the film was about. The film just sort of got lost in the shuffle at the end of the year, and now having seen it I am glad it did just disappear from the awards mix.The film is about a group of soldiers who are being honored at the halftime show at a Thanksgiving Dallas Cowboys football game. The film is portrayed through the perspective of one of those soldiers, Billy Lynn. The entire film takes place during this game and is littered with flashbacks of the war and events with family all seen through Billy's eyes. The film sounds decent on paper but the delivery was off and the film ended up being a long and uninteresting clich√©d film that is one of Ang Lee's weakest efforts in recent memory.The film set the record for having the highest frame rate and I was thinking why? Ang Lee is fairly innovative and his cinematography can be remarkable. However going for the high frame rate for a drama like this with little action made no sense. The characters pop out at you and look too lively and it just comes off really weird. It should have been saved for a different film. There are moments where characters dialogue right into the camera and it's just odd. Some scenes do pop out at you, especially the actual depiction of the halftime show but its not enough to be a saving grace for the film.The film stereotypes American soldiers and some aren't portrayed favorably. The war time scenes and relating depiction of PTSD doesn't really break any new ground or ever really touch you emotionally. In fact, its disconnecting. The film tries to cram in a ridiculous love story with a cheerleader for the sake of having a relationship in the film. The dialogue is cheesy and feels artificial as its too sudden and unrealistic. The films flashback format really hurts the film as while some of the flashbacks are necessary and interesting, the return to the present reminds you of how dull and drab the present sequence is.I think this is a great debut for Joe Alwyn who portrays a stern-faced under pressure Billy Lynn very well. The film also has a solid Kristen Stewart and a rare appearance in film from Chris Tucker. Its a shame they are wasted in a film with nothing to really offer the talent that was gathered. Its just a disappointment that something as visionary and monumental as Life of Pi was followed up by a generic, flawed, undeserving disappointment of a film.5/10"
" YAWN! and bad acting
",-0.5848,-0.3916,2017-01-28 00:00:00,4,"If people want to see a real war movie about heroes, watch Hacksaw Ridge. Billys long walk was a long yawn of a movie. First off I thought that casting was sub par. The acting was not good either. How can people really take vin diesel seriously after the popcorn action crap he appears in. Granted those are fun action movies but when there is a serious picture, they should leave him out. Now the story. The whole movie is based on him recalling bit memories while in a football stadium? Really? Then he has the supposed deep connection with a cheerleader he met for 10 minutes??? I mean Cmon folks any soldier or person that served in the military will treat this as a joke. A guy getting a sleeper hold while watching the game and nothing happens?? Oh OK. Yeah that could happen. Or how about the military men coming back and already offered a movie picture day 1 at the stadium? Sure....the fight at the end with the military guy shooting a gun to stop the fight and it just ends? What no police are called? OK. Just more cheese and less plot. What I did enjoy was the flashbacks of the Iraq scenes and that was it. Don't waste you time. Watch Hacksaw Ridge to watch a true hero's movie with a lot less cheese!"
" An interesting portrayal of the returning American serviceman as seen through clearly unamerican eyes of this director
",0.6597,0.4215,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"The first few sentences set the tone of the film. A reporter adds colour to some combat film footage referring to the people fighting the American troops as ""anti-coalition forces"" not as the indigenous population.I am writing this at the 13 minute mark. Already the director has included the modest beginnings of many of these troops from rural back waters having dreams to help pay for their younger sisters medical bills. Ever present is that lost expression on the young men's faces (what the hell am I doing here).Very, very different content from best picture 1946 ""The Best Years of our Lives""Keep that in your mind when you watch this."
" Best line in the film
",0.6369,0.9908,2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"-Warning! Spoilers! Do NOT read this until AFTER you have watched the film.-Around 1:35 in the film, when Albert (Chris Tucker) is in the bathroom talking to Lynn about what ""they call in my business, a Hollywood Moment.""As he is reassuring him, he says that he will, ""Go all the way to China to get this film made if he has to.""So meta. So awesome. Even the cinematography there, with the pep talk to Lynn ""..more Americans need to see the war like you guys do.."" was straight out of a prior generation American propaganda flick. Vocal tone. Framing.Ang Lee and the rest of the team did an amazing job with this. If any hour's plus worth of film can communicate so, so many of the true dynamics involved in the ""War on Terror"", this is the film to do it.This film should be mandatory viewing for all middle school or high school students. The characters and dialogue are so over the top sarcastic and poignant, that I truly believe all but the most dense and indoctrinated Americans will be forced to think and question by this film.The moment where the union thugs, whose conflict started over their slighted authority to clear the stage previously, ambush the shoulders, really drives how upside down our society has become with regards to where the reins of power are. They are there in hands those who put on the show to support the empire. Not those whose story is propagandized to in the first place.Military or Minimum Wage Service, which one will it be? Too many Americans are forced with that brutal choice for survival. This film does an amazing job of touching upon the absurdity between 'rich' and 'poor'. Above and beyond everything this film did well, the dialogue and casting for Garrett Hedlund as the SSGT leader of Bravo was beyond stellar. He perfectly projected that manipulative technique, that the military uses as a lever to keep some of the most good intentioned troops engaged in combat.""No matter how screwed up the mission. No matter how dire the circumstances. It is all about the man to your left, and to your right. They are there for you, and you are there for them.""Or as it was written in the film. (paraphrased) ""I need you Billy. I need you to help me keep these guys alive."" It was the moment that Lynn decided to stay with the guys. It is a moment that anyone who has ever made a commitment to someone else, and had that commitment tested in a manner that few ever will, can perfectly understand.I hope that people, after watching this film, take a real hard look at what is going on behind the reasons they are given. That they look at the reasons television, and the Internet give them for supporting a government, that sends good men, to do violence in some of the poorest places on earth, for the benefit of fewer than 1% of the world's population. Not just less than 1% of America's population, but of the world's population.""It would take a real hero to stand up to our country."" as Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) says at the end.But first, heroes would have to unplug from the narrative."
" The film offends the American value
",-0.1531,-0.7066,2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"For the patriotism and personal heroism that most films proclaim, ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" provides a reverse case. Against heroism, that is, against the war - Ang Lee carry out such a way of thinking to shoot war films, which is a rare logic. He did use a simple story from ""Billy Lynn"" to confirm this logic is reasonable and true. Through the hero's story against the heroism is the core of the original intention of "" Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"". In this movie, there are no heroes but civilians for the soldiers and no victory but harm for the war. Lynn is a young man who made a mistake. As an exchange of exemption from punishment, he entered Iraqi USA forces under his father's operation. Because of his ""cool mind"" in the confusion, he bravely saved the captain ""mushroom"" in a melee with the enemy. Although the ""mushroom"" had been dead, the rescue process was photographed by a camera which a journalist left behind in the war accident. After the video reached and flowed in the domestic, Lynn became an American hero.In this movie, the journey becoming a hero for Lynn is fast and unexpected, but the process of taking his hero coat by Ang Lee is slow and clear. Through Ang Lee in the film constantly changing lens in Lynn home, in football midfield show and in the war scene memories, these three scenes presented the helpless and sad way of a ""hero"" on the screen.Hollywood producers chatter to want to sign a film for Lynn's team B. The football team boss is only willing to use very little reward to plan to invest in the film in exchange for team B story. Some of the audience on the stand to the B class sent a tribute to the routine, while some say disrespectful words. The situation that the staff attacked team B in the exit could be not enough to put Lynn back to the battlefield words. However, who had an intimate relationship with Lynn and ignited Lynn to want to retire, the beautiful female cheerleader, with her unquestionable tone and eyes, put Lynn to the battlefield again and continue to play the ""American Hero."" The film continually satirizes Americans' attitude toward ""heroes"" by contrasting them. On the one hand, through the exaggeration in luxury midfield show and with television, it is to create and spread the existence of necessity of the ""hero"". On the other hand, by relentless treatment of the ""hero"" and indifferent to the ""hero"" as a tool, it is to meet the vanity but kicked out ""hero"" at last.Indeed, "" Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk "" is a genuine anti-war film. Its anti-war thinking is not past tense and not perceived. It is built on the future of people's overall attitude on the war above. "" Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk "" is certainly a masterpiece. If you really understand Ang Lee, you will understand what he wanted to say in this movie."
