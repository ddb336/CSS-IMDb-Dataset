" An incredibly compelling story coupled with great acting
",0.7425,0.9848,2021-04-06 00:00:00,10,"I sort of stumbled upon this movie when looking through Netflix. Decided to give it a go because it seemed interesting. It was much better than I could have anticipated. Almost every part of this movie was great. The story was extremely compelling. I would recommend that any American (or person who is interested in American history) watch this movie. It tells a story that I was never taught in school. But this story is one that will make you feel happy, sad, and upset at times. This story will give you a fresh look into one of the many wild stories of the civil war.The acting is also very good. The main characters are very convincing and sell their roles well. The scenery and props are also good in their attention to detail. The script is at times riveting and does a good job capturing the way in which southern people frequently speak. I truly felt like this movie was high quality in all aspects.I would recommend this movie to anyone 14+. There are plenty of violent scenes, tense scenes, and vulgar language. But these things only add the realism of the movie."
" Greatest Story You Never Heard
",0.6369,0.9498,2021-04-02 00:00:00,10,"This is such a powerful and interesting story that I and many others never knew about. As the Civil War slides ever-distant into the past, politicians and agenda-driven history-revisionists would rather force their simplistic and self-serving versions of ""what it was all about.""Too often we lose the ""real"" stories. The thousands of ""other"" happenings that portrayed a much different reality from what we are made to assume or ""consume"" because it serves someone else's interests.The Free State of Jones shows how the corrupt Democrats in league with the rich plantation owners conspired to form the Confederacy in order to protect their profits and power from the potentially destructive and destabilizing changes that the anti-slavery movement was threatening to impose. The movie tells the story of southerners who were not exactly sympathetic to the Confederacy because they realized they were victims of the plantation owners who did not have to serve in the war while benefiting from everyone else fighting to protect their establishment.Ultimately the story does not unfold quite the way we hope, but it does an excellent job of depicting the norms and attitudes of the times and it further shows that they are very hard to change quickly... if ever for some.I love everything about this film. One might expect it to get overly righteous or preachy but it never quite does. It manages to make its points in much more powerful and subtle ways.Everyone who is interested in the Civil War and ""what it was about"" should see this film. It's a great movie on all levels: story, acting, photography, realism, action, dialog, etc. It's also an invaluable history lesson and statement on what it means to be an American facing down the might of corruption and hypocrisy within their government."
" Great light shedding story
",0.6249,-0.25,2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,"From the first scene to the last, a truly riveting account of the end of the civil war and the beginning of 'freedom' for former slaves."

" I really liked this movie
",0.4754,0.3612,2021-01-28 00:00:00,10,"This is the true story of Newt Knight, a farmer in Jones County Mississippi at the time of the Civil War. It is a refreshing break from the typical movies about the South I've seen which either glorified the South or which focused on the cruel slave system. The perspective that wars are all about the poor fighting to help the rich stay rich was a mainstay that the action of the movie revolved around. Give it a watch. It's good.

" A complete mess
",-0.3612,0.7728,2021-01-26 00:00:00,2,"This movie is a complete mess. Historically inaccurate, incredibly dull, and the jumping between Newt and the descendent + the title cards every 20 minutes explaining the scenes/what was going on/what was happening historically. It was just too much. (Of nothing)I can understand why some people like the movie - I just happen to think that the ""real"" history of the ""Free State of Jones"" was more interesting than this Hollywood version that seemed to have a confused idea of what it was. ""Let's combine Remember the Titans with Glory and then combine that with a Ken Burns Documentary... but let's make it super dull and really stretch the truth of what happened so that it comes off like an old poorly written western.""More than anything I just found it clunky and dull."
" Fantastic film

" Solid movie. Beginning to end.
",0.1531,-0.128,2020-12-11 00:00:00,8,"Acting was great, story was amazing, and the fact that it played along with actually history was something I didn't know when I started the flick.There's some pretty heavy violence and animal abuse, but war is hell.Definitely recommend it."
" Actually a very good film
",0.4927,0.2552,2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"I was quite surprised with this because I saw quite a few bad reviews and it lost a lot of money. However truthfully it's a very good well made film with some solid acting all round. Matthew mcconaughey was the obvious stand out as you'd expect. I also had no idea about the true story so I found this really knowledgeable. Would highly recommend, ignore the bad reviews."
" Excellent movie - well worth watching
",0.7717,0.6597,2020-12-03 00:00:00,9,"Overall excellent.
This movie surprised us. It was gritty and realistic, relating the true untold story of southerners who resisted slavery and the Confederacy and the failure of Reconstruction. Though made in 2016, it has fascinating relevance to today's issues concerning institutionalized racism and voter suppression.
Great acting throughout.
This fine and important film did not get the attention it deserves. See it."
" Why can't Americans engage with their history?
",-0.2584,-0.6155,2020-11-26 00:00:00,9,"I note that this excellent, engaging, moving and disturbing film only grossed USD25 million. Is it too tough for Americans? The grim facts of how black Americans were and to some extent still are brutalised are brought to the screen in this recommended biographic cinematic experience."
" Sadness and heart aplenty
",-0.4404,0.9164,2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"Quality film.'Free State of Jones' tells the true story of Newton Knight's role in the American Civil War. As you'd hope/expect, it leads to captivating viewing. Matthew McConaughey is superb, while he's supported excellently by Mahershala Ali.It's tough to watch in large portions given the obvious things from the Civil War era, from the war itself but also to slavery. I had never heard of Newton Knight, so it was very interesting for me to see it unfold and learning bits - even with some creative license, I'm sure. It also serves an important message that slavery didn't end with the Emancipation Proclamation.I personally found the film very well paced and extremely nicely shot, McConaughey and Ali are the stars but there are also notable performances from the likes of Gugu Mbatha-Raw. It's a great film, one that's worth a watch. Sadness and heart aplenty."
" Confederate Crimes.
",0.0,0.0739,2020-11-13 00:00:00,9,"Nice to see a story about the decline of confederate power. These sorry excuses for human bings got what they deserved. Misguided abhorrent racists are still around, but less in number thanks to those who fought for justice.
Providing an education in doing so.Generation by generation, the fire sparked by pioneers of compassion increases in size, and children get exposed to higher standards of ethics. Films like this assist in steering young people away from crooked thinking inherited from racist parents.Out with the old, in with the new."
" The film is better than expected.
",0.4404,-0.5844,2020-11-06 00:00:00,9,"The film is better than expected. No doubt a hoolliwood film, but with a well-constructed narrative, nothing monotonous and quite critical"
" Better Than Average Civil War Film - Free State of Jones
",0.3182,-0.9141,2020-10-20 00:00:00,7,"I tend to agree with Mr. Brody of the New York Times; this film is better than most hack critics have given it credit for. The film is a very accurate portrayal of the Deep South during and immediately after the Civil War. The only weakness of the film was the avoidance of mentioning the Freedman's Bureau, which was often responsible for placing unqualified black officials in charge of various offices during the Reconstruction Period. This would most likely be referred to in modern times as reverse racism. That being said, nothing compared to the viciousness of the Ku Klux Klan during this period as well. The film highlights the damned if you do and damned if you don't situation poor whites and slaves faced during and after the Civil War. The performances are genuine and believable, and the action scenes are quite impressive. The film sometimes had the feel of ""!917"", with the senseless slaughter of thousands of young men for no apparent reason. It also had the feel of ""Robin Hood"" with Knight and his band of merry men, who were quite good at guerilla warfare. The fact that the film lost money at the box office is a testament to the ongoing ignorance of the general American public when it comes to complex films. Most Americans would rather be fat and watch simple-minded films. This is not one of them."
" True History will Tug at Your Heart
",0.4215,0.9462,2020-10-13 00:00:00,10,"This is a true recounting of events in American history. I respect that those who made this movie remained loyal to the historical account right to the end of the movie. Both the trials that freed slaves had to endure, and the close relationships made with some white southerners, reminds people of the humanity that can permeate any situation.Near the end of the movie, the viewer is reminded that freed slaves were registered Republicans, as they were across the nation, and that the KKK was created in 1866 by the Democratic Party. This part of American history is often overlooked or swept under the rug. The ""radical Republicans"" were hung along with the freed slaves and all this group wanted was any right of an American citizen. The movie allows the viewer to feel this yearning and mourn the murders of those who tried to fight for these rights.One of the best movies ever made. A movie that will bring both the realization of the origins of our political parties as well as the struggles during Reconstruction and the ugliness that some humans are capable of. A big thumbs up and this is a movie to add to your ""must-see"" list."
" Must watch!
",0.0,0.4926,2020-10-06 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie you have to see! Not just because its a good movie and good acting, but also because of the massage that is quite relevant now."
" Well shaped And acted history film
",0.2732,0.9132,2020-10-05 00:00:00,10,"This was an unexpected surprise. The story is well written, the cast does an awesome job at bringing it alive and grace to this movie, I learned of about a little talked about but very powerful part of this countries human history. It is a great film and even though it may be a bit rough and emotionally shaking, I highly recommend this movie specially in our turbulent times to perhaps bring a bit of clarity about the non existence of sides when facing greed, power games and sometimes pure evil."
" worth your time
",0.2263,0.5911,2020-09-05 00:00:00,8,Slow to long bored to the point of sleeping 😴 is often how I have found civil war films . This is not that. A constantly evolving story drives your interest. civil wars movies 🎥 sometimes not sure if there a documentary or film. This uses dates & facts to move the story forward. it's not at the cost of pace or don't take you out of the movie. Mathew Mcconaughey a perfect lead and surrounded with some great performances. Definitely worth a watch.
" It should have been a series
",0.0,0.4588,2020-06-14 00:00:00,10,"A fascinating look at history after the civil war, I certainly learned some new facts but I think that rather than being a film this story has much more to offer than being a film and should be created into a series."
" Just boring and slow
",-0.3182,-0.8823,2020-06-12 00:00:00,6,"I really wanted to say ""McConaughey proves he's no Kevin Costner in this film,"" but I have to say Matthews performance all on its own is actually really good. The acting is great it's just seems like a really slow story. It might be that I'm Canadian and find it really strange that Americans would fight so violently against themselves, but I was just really not interested in the plot of this movie but fought through right till the bitter end. I could see how Americans would be a lot more interested in this story but it just seemed like nothing new to me."
" What a belter of a film
",0.0,-0.782,2020-06-02 00:00:00,10,"McConaughey never fails to bowl you over with a sterling performance, having said that every single actor/actress in this film were outstanding.. captivated from start to finish giving a brilliant account of the early American civil war and its atrocities, the horrific slavery and then on ending with the evils of the klu klux klan. This film is a must see and a definite 10/10 for me!"
" Less annoying than most period pieces, but bad.
",-0.7546,-0.8433,2020-05-11 00:00:00,4,"There are a few good battle scenes which are rather violent. Luckily, there are no ""hurrahs"" or other annoying sounds or music which were annoyingly used in ""Gettysburg,"" and other period pieces. Matthew McConaughey's acting is completely flat! His son dies early in the movie, and he just has no reaction whatsoever! I mean, I give credit because the director probably got frustrated with his acting and just said, ""just stand there, you idiot!"" This is just another storytelling historical piece."
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.4576,2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,"One of the greatest civil wars films out there, very well written"
" Mostly good with some noticeable flaws
",0.4404,0.9654,2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"Set during the American civil war, the expectation for 'Free State of Jones' is perhaps just another battlefield drama, but to my surprise and to the film's credit, it attempts to be much more than that, with some degree of success.The good points; it is quite successful at combining a range of genres and manages to be both an informative biographical/historical piece and an effective action and drama film. It isn't always the case that this works well but for the most part 'Free State of Jones' gets it right.The main problem I had with this film was the length and pacing. It's slow-moving and meandering and often seems to lose focus on the storytelling, with too many seemingly irrelevant scenes. As a result it feels overlong and it can be easy to lose interest during the film's many dull patches."
" Very powerful but enjoyable
",0.7424,0.8993,2020-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Surprised that this movie is still ranked under 7 as I write this review. Very thought-provoking film well acted and well written. Sure, there were some liberties taken with the ""Based on a true story"" line but overall the injustices of that time were well represented. I'm not sure Mississippi is all welcoming now. But that's for the USA to figure out."
" Free State of Jones
",0.5106,-0.6818,2020-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Free State of Jones looks at the impact of the abolition of slavery in the south during the civil war. In short, black slaves stayed as slaves. Now they were unpaid sharecroppers and children were forcibly apprenticed. Poor white farmers became even more impoverished after they found themselves heavily taxed.Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) is a medic who deserts the Confederates to take a young dead soldier's body home to be buried. After encountering that those people back at home not fighting are abusing their power.Knight leads a guerrilla outfit of escaped slaves, deserters and poor farmers. They battle with Confederate tax collectors and despite being married he also lives with a slave woman Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw.)The story is mixed with scenes set in the late 1940s as a descendant of Newton and Rachel, who is considered partially black is deemed a criminal for marrying his white wife.Knight a real life figure was probably more of an outlaw going after wealthy southern landowners rather than a visionary progressive thinker.The plight of former black slaves is represented by the character of Moses Washington (Mahershala Ali.) He is one of the people who rescued Knight, he has a spiked collar around his neck. When Moses tries to get freed black men to register to vote, he gets lynched.As a drama, Free State of Jones is ponderous and stilted. Director Gary Ross feels weighed down by the story as it tries to cram too much in. It does however air a little known slice of history."
" ""Matty Mac"" drops out of society in the middle of The War Between the States and forms his own
",-0.5994,-0.9781,2020-01-10 00:00:00,6,"I finally got around to watching this Matthew McConaughey movie from 2016. I'd seen Matt sporting a god-awful looking beard in some photos and heard he was growing it for a role. Turns out that role was mid-1800's southerner Newton Knight and the movie was ""Free State of Jones"".I was unfamiliar with the story, so I had to do some reading up on Mr. Knight and his story as a kind of Mississippi ""conscientious objector"" during the Civil War. He originally is in the Confederate army as a battlefield nurse, but after seeing his nephew get killed in action, he deserts. Along the way, he hides out with some runaway slaves (including the great Mahershala Ali as Moses) and spends the rest of the war recruiting other deserters and fighting off the Confeds. who are looking for them. They end up taking over and ruling a county seat in SE Miss. for a spell before retreating back to the swamps as the war ends. He later becomes a farmer during reconstruction and watches the rise of the KKK wreak havoc on him and his new life living out his remaining years with a former slave woman while his orig. wife and son living nearby.This movie had some high production values, and the war scenes were very powerful. I 'm glad I watched it, but it seemed to be lacking something, and I can't tell you quite what that something is. It's also about 25 minutes too long, IMO, so I was getting antsy for it to get over.Check it out sometime if you're into Civil War history."
" An American Hero Erased From History -- Twice!
",0.5983,-0.9977,2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie that got a lot of attention when it came out a few years ago, yet somehow it never connected with audiences. And critics didn't seem to want to go to bat for it either.It's easy to see why the mass audience didn't like this movie. It's too long, it covers too much ground, and while Matthew McConaughey gives the role of ex-Confederate freedom fighter Newton Knight everything he's got, the character just doesn't jump off the screen like Charlton Heston in BEN HUR or Mel Gibson in BRAVEHEART. Newton Knight is just a lovable guy from the word go (we first see him hugging a scared boy on the battlefield, then holding him while he dies) and he has no personal demons (or prejudices) to overcome. He's not driven by personal anger or passion, just by an abstract love of justice.Related to that problem is the fact that Newton Knight doesn't square off with one single baddie who's tough enough to make it a real fight. Judah Ben Hur goes up against Massala in the chariot race, and they have a whole lot of personal history. William Wallace goes up against Longshanks, Edward I of England, who is so terrifying he almost jumps off the screen. But Newton Knight just fights a bunch of no-name dastardly Confederate officers, most of whom are portrayed as cowardly or incompetent. None of them have any personal grudge against him and no personal magnetism of their own.So the bottom line is that the general audience was bored to death.Now with critics I think the story is a lot more sinister. A lot of left wing critics tried to put this movie down as a ""white savior"" movie in which a perfect white guy has all the answers and saves everyone. The problem with that argument is that it would apply equally well to a movie like GLORY which covers similar events in the exact same time period. But none of the critics ever attacked GLORY or patronized the personal story of Robert Gould Shaw the way they patronized the story of Newton Knight.And there's a reason why. Robert Gould Shaw, the hero of GLORY, was a real life officer in the Union army. He was a Harvard graduate from a very genteel, distinguished Boston family who volunteered to command black troops and died leading them in a desperate charge against hopeless odds. Nothing wrong with that man's story. But did you notice the words ""Harvard"" and ""Boston"" and ""distinguished family?"" THAT'S the kind of white savior a left-wing film critic can love.Someone just like them!The thing about Newton Knight that turned off a lot of big name critics, (like Richard Brody of the New Yorker) is that he's not Robert Gould Shaw. He's not Harvard. He's not Boston. He's not even a West Point man like Grant or Sherman. Newton Knight isn't a white savior, he's poor white trash. Those kind of people are trash -- and they're supposed to ACT like it!The idea that a poor redneck farmer would make common cause with a bunch of runaway slaves (without government supervision or a liberal college degree) is just as frightening, just as terrifying, to a New York film critic as it would be to a Mississippi planter. Without poor whites to blame for racism, privileged white liberals have no way to justify their privilege. So it's a fundamental article of faith with them that all poor whites are beyond redemption -- a basket of deplorables, as it were.If you don't believe me, look up a piece Katha Pollitt published in THE NATION in November 2018. It's called ""Conservative White Women Won't Change Their Minds,"" and it's basically a hate-filled rant against all the white women who voted for Trump. But the real point of the article is that changing their minds is a waste of time. Katha Pollitt needs the white trash to stay trash. All her self-esteem depends on the belief that poor whites were and are and will be trash, now and forever.This movie proves that isn't true -- and that's why leftist critics had to bury it."
" Overly long historical war drama
",-0.5994,0.0383,2019-07-26 00:00:00,3,"Based on true events, this film is more so for those whom are interested in these type of war based historical dramas. There are solid moments but as a film nothing feels new or fresh. The acting isn't the problem, it's that the content isn't exactly interesting. It drags in several points and becomes stale and feels quite long after a while.This was a big flop at the box office and one would expect the reason being, it was released during the summer (bigger films overshadowed it), and it seems most casual moviegoers aren't interested in these historical based dramas. Also the reviews weren't great and the trailers didn't look too intriguing."
" Inspiring
",0.4215,0.6536,2019-07-20 00:00:00,9,"An inspiring true story about a white hero in the war against oppression, in this instance, black slavery. It's good to have some white heroes from that time. There are others. It gives young white people today a chance to understand that they have a rich and colorful history, too. That their belief in equality need not feel like an apology, but a well formed deep rooted belief born ages ago already in their own ancestors. Not all ""true"" stories are completely accurate when put to film, but this is true enough. A gripping, heartbreaking inspiration to continue a battle for equality between races, religions, men, women. Women are the final battle. Let's rally and keep the issues front and center until it is done."
" ""You cannot own a child of God.""
",0.0,0.8595,2019-07-08 00:00:00,8,"Here's a story that doesn't show up in the history books. It's a fascinating look at a man named Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey), who led an insurrectionist movement within the heart of the Confederacy, the reverberations of which still resonate today among both followers and detractors. McConaughey, once proclaimed as The Sexiest Man Alive by 'People' Magazine, is anything but here, portraying a back woods farmer turned soldier and human rights activist long before the term was ever invented. Putting racism aside, he takes up with a common law black wife (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) after his first wife abandons him, and leads former slaves and sympathetic Mississippi Southerners against the corruption of military rule that leaves his friends and neighbors destitute.Director Gary Ross did an exemplary job in researching this project, undergoing a two year history lesson to get to the heart of Newton Knight's mission. He encountered both supporters and those who felt Knight was a traitor to the Confederate cause, not unusual given Knight's preference for the American flag and treating former slaves as equals. There's a point in the picture that's somewhat confusing when it transitions from the early 1860's to a 1948 courtroom scene, but it quickly clears up when one realizes it's about a Knight descendant who's on trial for violating Mississippi's anti-miscegenation laws that surfaced following Reconstruction days. It wouldn't be until a Supreme Court decision in 1967 that declared such laws unconstitutional, paving the way for legal interracial marriages. An excellent treatment of that story can be found in the 2016 film ""Loving"".At a little over two hours, I found the picture compelling enough not to get bored as a number of reviewers on this board seem to indicate. Lately because of time constraints, I wind up watching pictures in segments, so that probably contributes to a movie not seeming as long as it actually is. What's probably even more interesting about Newton Knight is some of the things about him that are left out in the story. For example, with first wife Serena (Keri Russell), he actually had nine children, while common law wife Rachel gave him five more. Both families lived separately in different houses on Knight's one hundred sixty acre farm following the War. Knight's legacy is still a matter of question for residents of Jones County, Mississippi, some of whom find it easier to forgive him for fighting Confederates than for mixing blood."

I agree with other reviewers, the true story is a bit more complex and would be better served in a mini series to flesh out the details a bit better. I gave it a 8/10 because any reviews 4 and below are absurd, hopefully this helps counter that.

",-0.7964,-0.9022,2019-05-26 00:00:00,5,"Ross bit off more than he can chew... the story lolls and wallows in wartime violence and the rebellion, then rushes through the horrors and trauma of Reconstruction."
" Nicely done
",0.4404,0.9783,2019-05-09 00:00:00,8,"Although I have the impression that there was a too great focus on the fighting scenes it is a nice story. Too often such movies only concentrate on popular historical events which are often, well, let's say - written by winners - or suppressors and do often let miss and lack of real heroes. This one is about real heroes. Matthew McConaughey did once more a great job. I'm in love with his acting ever since Dallas Buyers Club."
" Flawed but important and entertaining
",0.7227,0.9605,2019-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Skips some fairly important historical details despite its significant length, but still comes out as a good flick that showcases a little-known but very important story. McConaughey is once again fantastic, somewhat eclipsing everyone else, and the script doesn't leave much room for us to learn enough about the other characters. That said, we still get a good overview of the events and (gruesomely realistic) action sprinkled throughout. The 1960s court case seems a bit like an afterthought, but needed to be included, and flash forwards were probably the right way to do it."

" Interesting and Obscure Historical Drama
",0.4019,-0.9888,2018-12-19 00:00:00,7,"I like any historical drama that brings up a part pf the Civil War I was totally ignorant of, a revolt in the South against the CSA that lasted the whole war. It was well done but sort of pedantic.
One part really bothered me. I really doubt the Confederate Army would hang some boys who defected from the rebellion, especially after they promised a pardon to all defectors. The CSA weren't Nazis, these were their people too, and if they wanted to deflate the rebellion, hanging some 13 yo kids was not going to help. Which of course led to a later ambush shoot-out where largely untrained civilians, including women and children destroyed the same CSA unit. Okay, I understand sacrificing some accuracy for drama, because the rest of the movie was fairly accurate, And Matthew McConnaughy did his usual good job as Newton Knight, the leader of the rebellion.
One thing I hate about IMDB is how they always give this awful left wing feminist hag of a reviewer, Flick Filosopher aka MaryAnn Johanson, the second link on the external reviews page. She trashed the movie because according to her juvenile intersectional feminist POV, the movie re-inforced the ""white savior"" complex. You see, Newton Knight & most of the principals were white, but they had some escaped slaves in their Free State of Jones. So according to her, half the movie should have been the black ex-slaves spouting Maoist #BlackLiesMatter platitudes. Then this alleged reviewer will go into comment section and trash and ban anyone who is critical of her lame feminist politics and generally lazy reviewer skills."
" Ridiculous and Dull
",-0.6369,-0.8302,2018-12-16 00:00:00,5,"Just when I thought I was going to fall asleep watching this pointlessly dull docu-drama of what otherwise should be a fascinating story, along comes the ambush scene in the church yard.I mean, come on, a bunch of dirt farmers start shooting soldiers dead with the accuracy of a S.W.A.T., team. No. 1 they would have spent more time re-loading than shooting. And No. 2 those guns have the accuracy of what, about 10 feet. Most soldiers probably couldn't have hit the side of a church, never mind old ladies making kill shots every time. So ridiculous.
I applaud Hollywood for its super-brave stance of making a story about dirt-farming southerners who would rather remain in the Union than fight to be part of a slave-owning Confederacy of toothless dunces. The only thing that surprises me is they couldn't find an excuse to pat themselves on the backs for this at Oscar time.
I'm sure there's a good story in here somewhere. But this movie misses the mark."

",0.4019,0.8266,2018-10-23 00:00:00,7,"This was a film that had the potential to be an epic. It falls far short of that label, but it is still at least a ""good"" film -- well above average (hence my ""7"" rating) -- and worth watching.The opening scenes capture in vivid detail the horrors of mid-19th warfare, where lines of troops got ripped to shreds walking in long rows directly into the enemy's musket and cannon fire. The horror continued for the wounded, who were subjected to the barbaric battlefield hospitals and surgical techniques of the day, which included no anesthesia and filthy conditions. All of this is captured vividly and in great detail in the opening scenes of the film.What I really appreciated about The Free State of Jones is that it brings to light a piece of American history that I think few Americans have ever heard about, especially if you are not from a Deep South state. The story of Newt Knight's ""secession within a secession"" movement was a real eye-opener. In some ways, the Confederacy itself was responsible for generating much of this secessionist sentiment, first by the passage of the so-called ""Twenty Negros Law,"" which clearly favored the large plantation owners over the small, subsistence farmers -- many of whom owned no slaves at all -- and then by the continued taking of the small farmers' food and supplies by the Southern army troops. You would expect the Northern troops to confiscate everything from the Southern farmers; you would not expect the same treatment from your own soldiers who were ostensibly fighting on your behalf. Legally, the Southern troops and the tax agents were authorized to take 10% of food and other property in lieu of payment of taxes. In reality, there was no oversight and the soldiers took whatever they wanted, often leaving the small farm families destitute and facing starvation.The film inserts flash forwards to a great-grandson of Newt Knight being tried for an interracial marriage in 1960's Mississippi. These scenes were awkwardly inserted and disrupted the flow of the 1860's - 1870's part of the story.This is a good, but not great movie, but worth watching, especially if you are a devotee of American history. It prompted me to do more research on this little- known part of American Civil War history."

After guerrilla warfare with the local forces who are tasked with raising resources from local farmers (often leaving them with nothing), Newt's people declare Jones County to be independent of the Confederacy. And they have even more work to do once the Civil War ends.Matthew McConaughey in a horrible beard plays Newt, an extraordinary ordinary man trying to do his best to balance conscience, family, right and wrong, in a miserable war of attrition and injustice. This true (albeit dramatised) story is fairly low-profile - I have never seen mention of any of the events in it before, but this dramatisation does well to convey why the Civil War started, the deeply held prejudices which prevailed throughout and which remained in place long beyond its end (the main narrative is interspersed with flash-forwards to a court case involving one of Newt's descendants in the fairly recent past, which makes the point that winning a war doesn't change minds).There are some action sequences - the opening battle scene is gripping and visceral - but this is mainly a thoughtful and leisurely recounting of one man's part in the fate of a small area of the USA during and after the Civil War: as such, there is more by way of discussion than action. Some might say it is slow and overlong: I had no problem.Having said that, the location work conveys a strong impression of the swampy, difficult farmland, and small townships where these events took place, and all the cast does well.And I, personally, walked away with my sense of injustice reinforced.

Writer/director syndrome :-( It does tell a harrowing tale, and of an area of American history which Southern Americans seem keen to suppress so it hits the 'worthy' button right on the nose.The direction is good and the actors superb, even if Matthew McConaughey (who I adore) often plays himself. Brilliant support from Gugu Mbatha-Raw, too.American history and civil war aficionados will want to see it, and it may tickle the fancy of western buffs, too, although probably not as much."
" I Appreciate A Movie That Sheds Light On A Little Known But Important Story
",0.3928,0.9737,2018-04-16 00:00:00,7,"My first reaction to this movie is that I really appreciate a movie that actually teaches me something. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about the US Civil War and the history of slavery and reconstruction - but I have to confess that this movie was my first introduction to the story of Mississippi farmer Newton Knight and his rebellion against the Confederacy. And it is a fascinating story. The movie seems from what I've read since watching it to be reasonably faithful to the real story of Newton Knight. A few things are embellished or glossed over and some composite characters are created - but the movie seems to offer a reasonable feel for the man and what he experienced and accomplished. For that reason alone, I'd say its well worth watching.It's also worth watching for the performance from Matthew McConaughey as Newton. I'm not a huge fan of McConaughey. But I thought he did a superb job with this role. Again, he made the character seem real. It was a gritty performance, as opposed to the general ""smoothness"" that often seems to accompany the characters he plays - and that often grates on me for some reason. There were other good performances in the movie - in fact, it would be hard to identify a bad performance - but McConaughey really carried this, and did well doing so.Knight came across as a complex man. His motivations weren't entirely clear. The movie does, however, make an incredibly valid historical point - poor farmers were being asked to fight for rich plantation owners. The ""20 slave rule"" was highlighted (if you owned 20 slaves you were exempt from Confederate military service - and for every 20 more you owned, your sons from oldest down were exempted.) In Jones County, where the events took place, this was a huge issue, as it had the smallest slave population of any MIssissippi county. Confederate raids on poor southern farms - taking wheat, hogs and pretty much anything else of value - was also shown as a sore point to many southerners and led to the rebellion. I wasn't clear on Knight's attachment to the Union. At first he told his followers (both poor whites and escaped slaves) that they weren't fighting for the Union, they were just fighting against the Confederacy. Then, suddenly, he's hoisting the stars and stripes over the Jones County courthouse. When the Union became the cause was unclear to me. Knight's personal life was even more complex. Married to a Serena - a white woman (played by Keri Russell) - and the father of her child, after they separate he takes up with Rachel - a black woman, and becomes the father of several of her children. Then Serena returns, and the three of them did co-habit apparently for many years. Knight and his group were ostracized after the War because of the bi-racial nature of their community and there was apparently a lot of intermarriage. This becomes the focus of a bit of side story revolving around Davis Knight -Newton's great-grandson. His story is interspersed throughout. He married his white sweetheart, but was considered black under Mississippi miscengenation laws and was arrested and put on trial because of the marriage. The movie circles back to Davis's story from time to time to show us how that worked out - and it was a reminder that the Civil War wasn't the end of America's racial problems.I really enjoyed ""Free State of Jones."" It's not a non-stop action type of movie. Instead, it does spend a fair bit of time exploring Knight's character and motivation and the racial issues involved. And it is a good introduction to a story that isn't very well known. (7/10)"
" Free State of Jones is a well acted and produced film, if uninteresting and sluggish.
",0.4019,0.9319,2018-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Slavery, plantations and the fight for freedom are well documented and popular themes in many many films. 12 Years a Slave and Lincoln immediately spring to mind. So this is nothing new. Portraying this period of time is extremely saturated, so there cannot be any mediocrity. Unfortunately, Free State of Jones is just that. The true story of Newt Knight forming a rebellion against the confederacy in the 1860's. To ensure that all people are free and treated equally. A commendable and admirable man, choosing to fight for other people even if that means losing the ones closest to him. I can always find respect in people like Newt and sharing idealisms like his on film is important to show how far we have come as a society. The plot never feels preachy, it's told with good intentions and facts. Various photographs are embedded throughout with text to explain the historical events that followed. Matthew McConaughey looks the part, acts the part and becomes invested into his character. He really does steal every scene. The weak supporting characters assist in McConaughey's screen dominance but that's not always a good thing. I wasn't emotionally invested in any of the characters, at all. If a characters tragically meets their demise, there was no impact. I didn't feel anything and thus I was uninterested. Gary Ross' direction is fine albeit rather clinical and bland. The narrative was overstretched to 140 minutes when it didn't need to, we're talking nearly 10 years of confederacy rebellion. Why? The pace was ridiculously sluggish at points and the monotonous characters really did not help. The third act then starts to intertwine Newt's great grandson into the narrative who is wanting to get married but can't due to laws against interracial marriage. Yes, it shows that laws haven't changed but it felt so forced and unnecessary in order to showcase a point. All I can say is that the film is fine. It is bland mediocrity at its finest. Not bad but not great."

" The Free State of Jones - Is a Thought Provoker
",0.5106,0.8911,2018-02-12 00:00:00,9,"The Free State of Jones is a striking epic by any measure. This remarkable effort by Writer/Director Gary Ross (Hunger Games) deserves to be honoured by a larger range of audience. So, why was it not?. In this climate of the now, more than ever obvious, political Hollywood machine - this honest treatment of a shameful event in the history of the USA is very close to opening many questions about America's current political state. Here we have a thoroughly researched (check out the prolific end credits) examination of a major, but shamefully little known historical event of the Civil War. (Any spoilers that might exist are minor and won't detract) A medical soldier (and farmer) is shocked at the way the Southern Army is treating its very own farming citizens - he defects and attempts to make it home to his family. On the way he experiences many eye opening situations. This story eventually leads up to Lincoln and the Republican Abolitionists - then goes on to look at the shameful events of the barbaric 'Reconstruction' aftermath. It also seriously examines the corrupt Democrats vote rigging shams as well as their seeming to share a shocking involvement with the hideous Ku-Klux-Klan. So, how much has truly changed in this political machine apart from a thin 'civilised veneer over the surface? It's all documented for those studying the war and seeking the truth. It's just that you may not find all that much about it in your school books. 
 
'Jones' is filled with marvellous production values: - performances, script, photography, music, just about anything you might ask for in a great movie. Don't expect nonstop action, it's detailed, so longish but never boring - it also employs some 'modern' editing styles but it all comes together in the end. It's an intelligent study of a serious blight on history - especially the South's. No big praises from the academy, but why would you expect any - perhaps it's too honest? Let's hope the producers recoup some of their losses through Cable, DVD and TV sales, they deserve it all. Don't miss this one."

Until recently there has been a coddling of the confederate era as a noble cause to assert state's rights. There have been statues of confederate soldiers and ""heroes"". Historical markers throughout the south emulating the southern sacrifice. This movie touches a nerve that many confederate sympathizers fail to admit. The southern rebellion was simply about money...and the rich plantation owners...to the sacrifice of human rights and the common white man who fought the battles whilst the plantation owners and their family was exempted for military service. This is a point where the epic war movie, ""Gettysburg"" failed to address. ""Gettysburg"" was defending both philosophical sides, therefore, avoiding controversy and making everyone a hero. Newton Knight saw the war as what it was really about...the rich plantation owners. And it was this hypocrisy for which he rebelled against. I would have given a ""10"", however, the movie became a little too preachy towards the end as it portrayed the Free State of Jones a Union State. There has been no evidence that Newton Knight created a Union State within the confederacy. Newton Knight created an independent state from the Confederacy and the Union. I am sorry this movie lost tens of millions of dollars at the box office. It did not deserve a loss. This was the fault of STX Entertainment which was obsessed with being a big screen competitor with the big boys. When STX started bullying its way around Hollywood to be a main player, I am sure (unsubstantiated) the competitors did whatever they could to make sure STX did not interfere with the status quo. Otherwise, I just plain could not see why this movie was not a success at the box office."
" A Story Untold.
",0.0,0.9541,2018-01-02 00:00:00,9,"When the trailers for this film first came out and were being shown in the theater and online, the plot seemed like a rather interesting concept. Despite the tagline of ""based on the incredible true story"", it somehow never quite registered that the Free State of Jones was a real place, it more so just registered that it was like most movies based on a true story- not so true to this true story. It also comes back to the fact that the story of Newton Knight and the Free State of Jones isn't quite written down in the history books or really talked about at all. And as no type of history buff, without that insertion into everyday learning, there was never really any mention of either subjects. Though it does pose the question as to why their story seems to have faded into the background; the whole thing almost seems to validate the statement of the winners are the ones who write history. Now, onto the actual movie itself. In personal opinion, the performances given by actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and Mahershala Ali to name a few was on the side of excellent and convincing acting from the look of each character to the attitudes portrayed by them all as they played these characters. While most movies portraying times that occured in the past seem to miss the mark in such categories, those who took part in creating all aspects of Free State of Jones managed to bring it all together and put together a movie that feels real rather than what it actually is; actors pretending to be people who died a long time ago. There are very few complaints about this movie, and even those happen to be minor. With a two hour and nineteen minute run time, the movie itself does feel a bit long and almost as though the movie should have ended around the time the war did in the movie, but they instead opted to continue the movie into the Reconstruction Era following the war. It just felt like a weird usage of the time in the movie but did not hinder the movie's quality overall. Another odd part to the movie were the scenes in which they flash forward to 85 years after the events of the movie to tell a short story of one of Knight's descendants for a miscegenation trial in 1940s Mississippi. At first it doesn't quite make sense as to why they decided to add this into the movie, but the point of it becomes more clear with the second half of the movie taking place during Reconstruction and the African Americans supposedly becoming equals to their white counterparts. Constitutionally, blacks were made equal to whites in the name of the law, but that hadn't quite caught on with society, and some may argue in the eyes of some it still hasn't. But to draw back to the 85 years later scenes, it connects to it on account that Knight's descendant was put on trial for being 1/8th black, apparently making him ""black enough"" to make his marriage to a white woman illegal. This entire story went to show that no, whites and blacks were not equal. Racism was still running all throughout the south in whatever form they thought they could manage. All in all, the Free State of Jones is both a captivating and educational film on the standpoint this is not a topic very many people ever learn about in their lives, some sources online even show the people living in what's now known as Jones County don't even seem to quite agree about the story of Newton Knight and the Knight Company the movie focuses on. In the end, would highly recommend this movie to anybody; history buff or not."

" Just misses the mark
",-0.2263,0.9951,2017-12-15 00:00:00,6,"An ex-Confederate organizes a rebellion in southeastern Mississippi during the American Civil War and continues to battle for equal rights for freedmen during Reconstruction in Free State of Jones (2016), written and directed by Gary Ross. The film alternates between the 1860s and a 1948 miscegenation trial, to the detriment of both. Free State of Jones bombed at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics.The film begins at the Battle of Corinth in northeastern Mississippi, October 3-4, 1862, in which Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn attempted to dislodge Union forces commanded by Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans from fortifications around the town of Corinth. Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) is a medical orderly in the Confederate army from Jones County, a predominantly poor area with few slaves.Knight is disgruntled to learn of a Confederate law that allows sons of plantation owners to avoid military service depending on the number of slaves his family owns. This was designed to guard against slave uprisings, but it angered some poor whites who believed they were fighting a ""rich man's war"". When Knight returns the body of his nephew Daniel (Jacob Lofland) to his home county, he learns that Confederate Captain Elias Hood (Thomas Francis Murphy) is excessively confiscating goods from the local population.Things get complicated when Knight meets and falls in love with a slave, Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), despite being married to Serena (Keri Russell). He fights back against the tax collectors and hides out in the swamp, where he meets fugitive slaves and befriends Moses (Mahershala Ali). Together with other deserters, they successfully rebel against the Confederacy and proclaim a Free State of Jones. After the war, freed slaves struggle against a segregationist South.The events of the Civil War era and after are interwoven with the 1948 miscegenation trial of one of Knight's decendants, Davis Knight (Brian Lee Franklin), a product of his affair with Rachel. The Mississippi Supreme Court eventually overturned Davis' conviction, but this postscript to the story seems out of place in the larger narrative. It would have been better to briefly show the trial as an epilogue, or have the whole film about the trial with flashbacks to the events of the 1860s. Instead, Free State of Jones feels like two films awkwardly smashed together.Still, Free State of Jones features some solid performances. Matthew McConaughey needs no introduction. He transformed himself from teen heartthrob to accomplished actor, starring in films like Dallas Buyers Club (2013) and TV shows like True Detective. In 2016, he also played the lead role in Gold. McConaughey performed admirably in Free State of Jones, although his transition from combat orderly to brilliant guerrilla leader is less than convincing.Mahershala Ali, an African American actor from California, has appeared steadily in film and television since the early 2000s, most notably as Boggs in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay parts one and two. Though forced to play second fiddle to McConaughey in Free State of Jones, Ali brings to life his fictional character and personifies the plight of politically active freedmen following the Civil War.Free State of Jones is not a strict retelling of history, but it remains faithful to events writer/director Gary Ross wanted to portray. Much of Newton Knight's complicated personal life was simplified for the screen, and the scene depicting a handful of Confederates attacking a Union position while Knight and his nephew try to flee was unrealistic. This and other inaccuracies are relatively minor.It's a shame this film fell flat, because the American Civil War is such a rich period of history with so many compelling stories to tell. For some reason it's been difficult for Hollywood to get it right. Glory (1989), which won three academy awards, shows it's possible to create a compelling and popular drama set during the Civil War. Free State of Jones unfortunately missed the mark."

But, an aspect that continued to annoy me throughout the film were quick cuts from one scene to another, like Ross's slow pace suddenly became too quickened. Often, when one scene did not feel complete, it's cut to a different time of day with usually a different setting. The film itself is a failed opportunity for a little-known story that definitely could have been better capitalized on. Overall, ""Free State of Jones"" is a sloppy historical telling that quite frankly deserved to be condemned by most critics."

" Hugely rewarding celebration of American history
",0.5709,0.9949,2017-09-19 00:00:00,9,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As the American civil war draws to a close, Commander Newton Knight (Matthew McConaughey) defects from the Confederacy, his soul and spirit battered by the horrors and atrocities he has witnessed, fighting for a cause he doesn't believe in and has no stake in. He returns home to his family a broken man, but finds salvation by heading out and joining a group of freed slaves, headed by the charismatic Moses (Mahershala Ali) who are fighting for their rights, and they rise up and form an army against their oppressors, while Newton has an affair with Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw.) Eighty five years later, their grandchild sits in a courtroom battling his right to marry a white woman in the State of Louisiana...In a time where various film academies are being cajoled into recognising the talent of black performers more than they have, and black rights activists are using historical injustices to highlight present culture (the recent Detroit being probably the most brazen example!), a film like Free State of Jones finds a nice little bubble to fall comfortably in to. But, unlike much of the hysterical, exaggerated hand wringing and hyperbole that has surfaced in the midst of it all, Gary Ross has crafted a smooth, subtle, balanced piece, that avoids sensationalism and paints a genuinely rattling, highly absorbing film, that covers every inch of the ground it explores, and keeps you engrossed until the end.Performances wise, in the lead role, McConaughey is probably better than he has ever been, carrying the film superbly and delivering a broader range as an actor than he ever has before. He portrays a man who discovers his own character and is unable to let it go, at a time in American history where most others are blindly following along like sheep. But he still has an amazing supporting cast, most notably Ali as Moses, a man who has suffered tremendous indignity, but refuses to let go of his own dignity, as he goes on his noble quest, only to be met with an emotionally shattering conclusion. The performances and the writing are both perfectly balanced, and they compliment each other just fine.At a time when diversity is taking an arguably more aggressive means of instilling itself, here's a project that has the integrity to stand on it's own. How surprising, then, that it got such less attention. ****"

I had never heard of it until I came across a radio interview with Matthew Mcconaughey where he expressed his disappointment at the coming and going of this movie without much of a peep. I, for one, and in total agreement. It is a travesty.The acting across the board is superb, the pacing is good (often a bug bear of mine with many films being 20 mins too long) the story is gripping. I can imagine it was difficult to fit so much into a reasonable length of time but the Director/Editor achieved it.The violence is necessary but yet not gratuitous. The cinematography is spot on with a real authentic feel and the attention to detail seemed to me extremely high. A lot of work went into this movie and I hope that it finds it's audience through (legitmate) streaming services. I am very glad it was suggested to me when I logged in and glad I spent this evening viewing it.Spread the word!"
" A below average waste of potential
",-0.4215,0.9433,2017-07-11 00:00:00,4,"The premise of this movie really interested me so I gave it a watch and all I was say was I was really bored watching this film and this is one of the biggest wastes of potential in recent memory. The premise of the film sees a man fed up of the Confederacy creates his own army to take them on. Mathew McConaughey plays the lead in this film and he does an excellent job in this film, he gives an emotionally charged performance that sells that he truly Cares about this role. He also gives a strong performance to make you believe in him as the leader in this group. Mahershala Ali is in this film and he is great, he is building a resume as a truly brilliant actor. His character is very strong and I did like his friendship with McConaughey and how it grows throughout the film. Gugu mbatha-raw plays a slave in this film and she does a good job in the film especially when provoking the emotion of her situation. Everybody else in this film though plays cliché stereotypes and I really didn't care about them in any way even keri Russell who isn't really given much to do in this film. The story on paper sounds really cool but actually it really isn't, it is very bland as the film slowly goes through to build this society but you really don't care because the film has bored you so much and really doesn't go far enough with its subject matter. The script has so much drama in it but I didn't find any of it to be memorable or help make me care which means it was a failure. The style has some pretty entertaining action scenes and while they are happening they are fun to watch. But this films pacing is horrendous as it feels like such a drag and having to sit through this movie which is way to long. Overall this film is one of the most dull films I have seen in recent memory and is just not very entertaining."
" Engaging American Civil War drama - and it's true!
",0.1511,0.9549,2017-07-02 00:00:00,6,"FREE STATE OF JONES is a well-mounted American Civil War story that smacks of good intentions and worthiness. Matthew McConaughey stars in a role that reminded me a little of Mel Gibson's one in THE PATRIOT, playing a disillusioned farmer from the South who decides that he's had enough of fighting the war and thus rebels against his own side. This is a slightly long-winded production with a little too much in the line of heartfelt conversation, but it does feature some stunning battle sequences which go for out-and-out realism and succeed admirably. The story as as a whole is heartfelt and has the 'true' hook to make it even more engaging."
" Overlong but highly informative take on little known facet of Civil War history
",-0.7469,0.7369,2017-06-24 00:00:00,7,"It cost the producers about $50 million to make ""Free State of Jones"" but it only made $25 million at the box office. Maybe it was a little too long, or tried to bite off a little more than it could chew, and that's why it didn't catch on with the public. Nonetheless, it's a highly educational tome on a little known facet of Civil War history and is worth a look.This is writer/director Gary Ross' pet project which was in the making for a good number of years. The story begins at the 1862 Civil War Battle of Corinth where Newton Knight (played by a thoroughly convincing Matthew McConaughey), a poor farmer from Jones County, Mississippi, is a disillusioned medic for Confederate forces tending to wounded soldiers despite a lack of tangible medical supplies available. Ross presents a realistic recreation of a Civil War battlefield replete with Confederate soldiers marching in a suicidal formation against entrenched Union forces who blast them with superior artillery and rifle fire. The political situation is also explained as the rank and file are perturbed by the newly issued ""Twenty Negro Law,"" which exempts rich slave owners from the draft if they own a minimum number of twenty slaves.It's this atmosphere that causes Newt to think about deserting. He does so after his underage nephew shows up with the news that he's been drafted and most of the possessions on the family farm have been confiscated. The last straw occurs when the nephew is shot on the battlefield despite Newt's efforts to protect him (the nephew and his unlikely appearance is completely fictional, as Ross occasionally must make up character and scenes out of whole cloth, to fill in unknown details of the protagonist's personal life).After deserting, in a memorable scene, Newt instructs a woman and her daughters how to handle firearms and repels a tax collector-soldier and his posse who show up at a farm to once again confiscate property. Newt becomes a wanted man and retreats to a swamp where he's aided by escaped slaves. One slave in particular, Rachel (who eventually becomes his second wife and mother of some of his children), saves his son from a high fever.Eventually more Confederate soldiers begin defecting and end up joining Newt in the swamp where they organize ""The Free State of Jones."" They successfully conduct raids against Confederate forces and take control of Jones and some neighboring counties. In perhaps the most exciting scenes in the film, Newt and his group ambush Confederate soldiers at a church by hiding in coffins and dressing up as women. Newt kills the commanding officer in revenge for the hanging of teenagers who left the swamp after they were promised amnesty.The last third of the film which deals with the Reconstruction period is a bit anti-climactic. Ross however makes a good point about how initially blacks were disenfranchised despite gaining their freedom, after local governments enacted ""apprenticeship"" laws, a form of indentured servitude. Only with the appearance and protection of Federal troops were blacks allowed to vote and gain office. Meanwhile terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan remained influential in the region. Ross invents the fictional character of former slave Moses Washington, a friend of Newt, who ends up lynched by racists.Newt's last battle is just prior to the Election of 1876, where his efforts to help blacks vote fail after the Democrats (associated with white supremacists at the time) prevent Republican voters (mainly supported by blacks) from allowing any of their votes to count.Ross only briefly touches on the conflict between the poor whites and former slaves while they are united fighting against the Confederacy. Ross perhaps was reluctant to explore this issue further as it might tarnish the legacy of Newt's Free State movement.In addition, there is a series of unwise flash forwards involving Newt's great-grandson who was hauled into court in 1948 for violating the State of Mississippi's miscegenation laws (the absurd claim that Newt's great- grandson was ""1/8th Negro,"" prevented him from marrying at the time). This could have easily been mentioned during the closing titles.In addition to McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw does excellent work as the embattled Rachel, who taught herself how to read and had to contend with the opprobrium of her community due to her relationship with Newton Knight.The Free State of Jones often feels like a glorified history lesson with all those attendant titles that pop up throughout the film, cluing us into what's going on in terms of historical chronology. Nonetheless, it remains a fascinating story that I certainly knew nothing about until watching such an informative film."
" Powerful story, clumsily told
",0.4215,0.9749,2017-06-03 00:00:00,7,"1862. A Confederate Army solider, Newton Knight, is disillusioned with the war and its causes and deserts, going back to Jones County, Mississippi. There he finds even more reasons to despise the Confederate cause. Over time he amasses an army of deserters, women and runaway slaves and turns Jones County, and a few neighbouring counties, into an independent region, the Free State of Jones.Based on a true story, a powerful story of defiance and tolerance against a backdrop of bigotry and hate. These great themes, plus some excellent, gritty action scenes and solid performances make this a solid historical drama.Far from perfect though. With all this historical information to work with, the writer and director find it hard to turn it into a concise, coherent, point-making film. You get the feeling they didn't know when to end the story, so keep going long after the natural end. While the story of African-Americans in the post-Civil War South is a sad one, especially in the light of the hope that the result of the Civil War promised, by tacking this on it feels like an over-extension of the story. Moreover, that part of US history is not unique to Jones County. It feels like the writer and director were just trying to milk an already-known part of history, rather than add anything new to the conversation.This clumsiness is not limited to the final few scenes. The story set in 1947 seemed unnecessary and there are scenes near the beginning that do nothing but slow down and draw out the movie.Overall: good, but with better focus, better editing and a tighter script this could have been brilliant, and done in 20-30 minutes less."
" this movie needed more drama
",0.0,-0.8367,2017-06-03 00:00:00,5,"This movie was OK, but it could have used some more drama. Newt Knight is in the confederate army during the Civil War and after the death of a young relative, he deserts his position. So of course, if caught, he could be hanged. With the help of friends, he finds a home in the swamp after being hampered by a dog bite. He lives out there with some runaway slaves. More men join as the desert the confederate army and soon they have a good number and decide to stand up for their land and food. They win some battles and the Civil War ends, and the film continues as it shows how the ex-slaves had to overcome new laws after the slavery is abolished. The movie shows apprenticeship laws. And also the struggle to vote and one of the main characters hangs from a tree.OVERALL: The movie was OK, but too long, it should have been 30 minutes shorter. Like ending when the Civil War was over."

A solid actor in another deserving lead, coupled with a few more key performances, saved this movie from the trash bin. Honestly, this film should have at least made budget, but that's what happens when you open next to Finding Dory. For me, any excuse to see McConaughey and the explosive rise of Mahershala Ali is a good one. I would even go so far as to say it would not have been worth the time if not for the addition of Ali's fictional Moses Washington. The film otherwise struck me as anecdotal and I could have easily done without the flash-forward miscegenation case. After the strong opening, I have to say I was a tad disappointed.

However this film is very accessible and you don't need to be an expert on the civil war to enjoy it.Free State Of Jones taught me a lot I didn't know about the Confederate states such as the 10% requisition law and the ""20 negro law"" and in general how the South was governed during the Confederate years. Matthew McConaughey is great as Newt Knight and definitely the best acted character in the movie. The movie spans not just The Civil war but also the years afterward and we get to see Knight's participation in the fight for black civil rights.The film has a great pace and the dialogue was also well done. The action scenes are entertaining to watch and the opening battle scene is gory and at times hard to watch. I thought the use of real photo's from the time period was a nice touch too. I did think the film's lack of racial slurs worked against it as I don't think it was very representative of how people in the South would of spoke at that time.Overall I'd definitely recommend this film."
" A wasted opportunity
",-0.1027,0.9944,2017-03-26 00:00:00,4,"A hugely unfocused Civil War/slavery epic that never allows the audience true access into the importance of what is transpiring before them, Free State of Jones ends up as a 140 minutes' worth of disappointment and marks itself down as one of 2016 biggest wasted opportunities.Offering up the appealing prospect of Matthew McConaughey continuing on his engaging career revival in a lead role he seemed born to play, Seabiscuit and Hunger Games director Gary Ross unfortunately fails to ignite the passion in his telling of the true story of Civil War deserter turned hero Newton Knight, who joined up a rag tag group of fellow deserters and slaves to fight the good fight and stick it to the men in uniform who cared little about the health and safety of citizens it didn't even deem worthy of human rights.Transpiring's that take place throughout Free State of Jones, whether it be Knight in the heat of a bloody frontline battle, swamp based townships or bullet filled fights for freedom, feel like comings and goings rather than engaging events, Ross struggling to find the films core aim and for a big budgeted drama, the film feels like it's been cut from a budget TV production, and for a film intent on trudging along past the 2 hour mark; by which time many a viewer will have switched off mentally after the film seems to hit a huge hurdle after the 100 minute mark, this is detrimental to Jones's chances of success, despite its commitment from its wasted cast.To be honest, McConaughey could've played the role of Knight in his sleep, but that can't take away the fact he still does a fine job of portraying an everyman who became a leader in a time when people needed it most. Support's like rising star Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Oscar winner Mahershala Ali and the underused Kerri Russell all do fine work but like the way the films pace is lost in a shoddily edited and misguided narrative (which includes a bizarrely intrusive court case set years after events here), they're never really given proper time to shine despite all the elements clearly there for them to do so.There's a great film (or perhaps mini-series) at the heart of Free State of Jones, some scenes within the film clearly show this, but this often unengaging and emotion free experience ends up as huge waste of talent and a mismanaged telling of an interesting moment in American history that should've made for a film far better than the one Gary Ross has conjured up here.2 uncomfortable neck accessories out of 5"

With that being said, I cannot say what facts they messed up or things like that. I have this movie an 8 only because there's a bit of the time line of the story that is weird and only half makes sense because it takes place in the 1960's. Moving on, the rest of the story is incredible. All of the actors are wonderful and make it a great film. It's too bad it wasn't sold or advertised more, but politics of Hollywood prevail. The story has lots of religious overtones which could be part of it. This story not only goes through the Civil War, but Restoration is covered too. That is something that you don't see much of, the things the Southerners went through after the war. Matthew McConaughey just delivers a great performance again!

A lot of blood and guts splattered, but after all war is messy. McConaughey, complete with his Texas accent, is forceful and charismatic. Battle scenes are very good and Civil War followers should be pleased.McConaughey is outstanding as is Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who plays Rachel. Also in the talented cast: Mahershala Ali, Keri Russell, Bill Tangradi, Sean Bridgers, Christopher Berry, Joe Chrest and Jacob Lofland."
" A film with great potential and a fascinating story is boring, uninteresting and emotionally uninvolving
",0.5106,0.9063,2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"I had high hopes for Free State Of Jones. As a late viewer to this film I had seen the YouTube reviews and read the reviews online as well and was surprised by the reviews. After watching, I'm not totally surprised now.Free State Of Jones is definitely a movie that had potential. It's concept and story about its real-life counterpart sounded fascinating, and the film really delivered with strong performances from Matt McConoughey and the entirety of its cast. But that's about it.After a really riveting opening battle sequence, the film falls into conventionality and tries to balance so many stories all at once but fails at doing so. The film spans across 14 years and if the film had just stuck to one period instead of trying to squeeze so much out of it the film would've fared a lot better than it did. That opening battle sequence really sets up for a riveting, edge-of- your-seat action/thriller type film. But at its core it really is a drama. And I mean DRAMA. I have no problem with a film being a drama. Some of my favorite films are dramas. I guess what I was expecting from Free State of Jones was a drama with action/thriller elements. There is some of that, but too little of it. When the battle sequences are happening, your interest in the film really starts to spike up. You really think that this could turn into the intense heartthrob that the movie was trying to be. But the pace of the film is excruciatingly slow. The battle scenes are few and far between. There are some many scenes of dialogue that drag not because they are talking, but because the scene lasts for too long and the dialogue presented isn't all that important. The film is 2 hours 20 minutes and because of this slow pace the film can feel extremely long and overwhelming at times. As I stated before, there is too much going on in this film. The timeline of the film spans for far too long, and there are some really strange flashbacks in the film that make you question why these scenes are even in the movie. The film answers your questions to these scenes, but in a way where you believe the film could have just done without those scenes and could've told you that from subtexts that pop up during the entirety of its runtime.The story is fascinating, no doubt. It is a story that should be told. It is a film full of good intentions. Unfortunately, you aren't that emotionally invested in any of the characters to actually care. Newt Knight really just feels like a character that is just there to move the story along. He doesn't really do anything all that interesting aside from helping locals fight the corrupt government. Motivations weren't entirely clear with Newt, and though he had good intentions the fact that the film spans so many years of his life really doesn't help you get emotionally attached to this character.Free State Of Jones had all the potential to be a great war epic and Oscar contender. But an excruciatingly slow pace, no emotional investment in characters and clunky storytelling spanning many years really bring the film down to conventionality. Free State Of Jones feels like a made-for- TV History channel movie starring big name actors. i give the movie credit for trying, but it fell a little flat for me.I am giving Free State Of Jones a 6.4/10"

This one, made by Gary Ross in 2016 and starring Matthew McConaughey as Newton Knight, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Rachel Knight, Keri Russell as Serena Knight, and Mahershala Ali as Moses Washington among others, this period piece is a Masterpiece. Its skilled change of pace, balancing between fast, brutally bloody battle scenes and slow, pastoral peaceful moments is a great achievement, and it all is beautifully backed by perfect Mississippi nature. Matthew McConaughey is superb here, he is the driving force and he shines all throughout the movie, with his masterful strokes and subdued muted passion that is still vivid and awesome.

This actor who gets so involved in his roles that radically changes his physical appearance if required by the film.Photography is very video camera and does not bring much to the story.The management, who does not know that he is making a film too long, at times boring and does not have nice plans.The atmosphere is very well done.

" A history lesson to the detriment of character development and emotional investment
",0.1531,-0.9586,2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"Making a point of eschewing the typical Hollywood formula for historical reenactment, Free State of Jones is an incredibly sober and stoic document chronicling the plight of a rag-tag bunch of farmers, Civil War deserters and escaped slaves who group together in the Mississippi swamps to fight the Confederate army who are taxing the poor in order to keep the rich fat and prosperous. After years of glossing over their bloody history, American film-makers now seem eager to depict the grim time of slavery and how it tore the country apart, no doubt reacting to the endless news stories of racially motivated violence, which seems to be on the rise in our fearful, paranoid society.Writer/director Gary Ross (of Pleasantville (1998) and The Hunger Games (2012) fame) takes the subject matter so seriously that he has made less of a movie than a dramatised documentary, going as far as creating a website dedicated to explaining the historical and political context of the movie, as well as highlighting just how close to real-life the film veers. Apart from an opening battle in the trenches, where Confederate medic Newton 'Newt' Knight (Matthew McConaughey) finally loses faith in the South's cause, and a gun- fight between the rebels and a band of Dixie soldiers, the film is incredibly light on set-pieces, instead choosing to give a history lesson to the detriment of character development and emotional investment.Newt's desertion places a target on his back, so he escapes into the Mississippi swamps where no army can touch him. He is helped by slave Rachel (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), while his wife Serena (Keri Russell) packs up and leaves after the constant having taxing by Confederate soldiers leaves her unable to support herself. Newt comes across a group of escaped slaves, bonding with Moses (Mahershala Ali) who is shackled by a horrific, pronged neck brace, and soon enough they are joined by poor folk unable to cope with the Army's constant harassment, and more deserters who have realised that they are fighting a rich man's war. With some smuggled-in weapons, the unlikely comrades choose to fight back, establishing the 'Free State of Jones', where any man is welcome and gets to eat what he grows.Eager to draw parallels to the modern-day (the film occasionally switches to a court-case 80 years after the war involving Newt's great-great-great grandson) and highlighting a neglected chapter of American history, Free State of Jones clearly has its heart in the right place. Yet Ross is so clearly wary of causing offence in our overly-sensitive times, that the film becomes an emotional wasteland. McConaughey is terrific as the salt-of-the-earth leader, but his character is never allowed to develop beyond the odd motivational speech or moment of defiance. The film is strangely observational, making the drama about the rebellion rather than the rebels themselves. resulting in an absence of emotional investment when the more personal sub-plots play out. That said, it's incredibly well-made and authentic-looking, and I felt thoroughly educated afterwards."
" Free State of Jones
",0.5106,-0.6796,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"The Free State of Jones in which Newton Knight played by Matthew McConaughey struggles with the values of the confederacy. The death of his nephew and that the confederate army were taking supplies from poor townspeople pushed him over the edge enough for him to want to rebel against the Confederacy. In this film it shows the moral struggle between what Knight thinks to be right or wrong. When faced with this dilemma he looks to morals over barbarous actions. He eventually realizes that he doesn't want to be on the side in which it dehumanizes actual human beings. The movie overall was an 8. The acting is top notch and being based on a true story the accuracy was mostly all there.This movie is a very action filled American war story but, you can tell there are different moral messages also being portrayed."
" Pleasingly Accurate Civil War Movie
",-0.5994,0.972,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Usually, historical movies have to take some amount of artistic freedom with the story to keep the film interesting. ""The Free State of Jones"" did a very exceptional job when it comes to historical accuracy. After reading up on the actual Jones rebellion I can confidently agree with many of the other reviews that this movie almost perfectly recounts the events of the real rebellion. From a film standpoint it is also wonderful, intriguing framing in combination with sparingly used gore and violence hint at a much bigger conflict than what is being shown on the screen. Gary Ross did an outstanding job with this film and I am glad to have chosen to watch it for APUSH."
" good film, accurate, recommend
",0.6597,0.803,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"The free state of Jones was a rather entertaining movie which depicts the struggle of southern people attempting to rebel against the confederacy. whilst the movie is not 100% accurate to true history,it is close. the film had an impeccable balance between modern action movie and subtle historical documentary. you feel an exhilaration during the battle scenes like the church ambush but then a solemness afterwards, for instance,when Daniel is fatally wounded. the movie does a great job of telling the tale of the Jones county rebels in an exciting and interesting way. the whole movie however is not just war, it has a deeper more metaphorical meaning. the character of Moses is fictional and is used to portray the many runaway slaves that knight encountered during his escapade. and the few scenes showing his descendant continuing to encounter issues for the same problems that knight himself fought to fix."
" Incredibly Realistic Civil War Film
",-0.6326,-0.8885,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"For a movie that is based off of a true historical event, it's often difficult to find the right balance of an interesting plot and an educational experience for the audience. However, Free State of Jones seemed to have found the proper balance between these elements. For example, multiple scenes which contained action and more viewer appealing content(which was all realistic) would soon be followed by a dramatic death with an eerie five person funeral or the torching of someone's property. This is effective in any war related film because although these events almost all took place outside of the battlefield, it reminded us of the harsh reality of life during a war, which in this case was full of racism, corruption, and deserters and runaway slaves plotting rebellion. Another thing this movie did well was show the long term effects the Civil War had in America. Although the switch from Newton to his descendant Davis wasn't always the smoothest or most logical, the ending clarified that even 80 or so years after emancipation, segregation and racial differences continued to divide the South. Free State of Jones demonstrated that it could cause problems for any man with the slightest trace of African American in him at the time, like Davis. Therefore, I give this film an 8 out of 10 as I believe it had the perfect amount of information and actual movie plot to keep it educational and entertaining at the same time."
" Very Realistic, Would definitely watch again!
",0.5033,-0.0698,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"The plot and scenes in the movie kept you watching and wanting more every second. Never was there a dull moment or a time I found my mind wondering off. The story told and all the events do not seem to be stretched at all. There were a few things throughout the movie that were upscale a little bit for the ""Hollywood"" effect, but they didn't changed the story or ruin the movie at all.The way the movie goes into such detail down to the sun bleached dirty clothing they are always wearing is perfect. The actors too. With some movies you get the minimum child actors who do just enough to get the part and fit in. The kids in this movie were perfect and didn't ruin the role. Through out the movie, scene of a court case for the grandson of Newton Knight are shown. These scene I feel are unnecessary to the plot and story of the movie. They just tie in random bits and pieces."
" Historically Accurate Movie
",0.0,-0.1855,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Being an APUSH student, we were given the assignment to watch a movie based on the civil war. This movie being recently made, I had picked it and I am glad I did. This movie tells the truth of what it was like during the time it takes place in, and gets everything right, down to the clothes and speech. It also is very thorough, and there is no gaps left in the story that leaves you questioning. It does a good job of making sure the time period was conveyed - and I am not a big fan of movies that try to tell real stories. Of course, from a critical standpoint, I do believe they could have mentioned the true reason of the civil war (which is why I did not give it a 9 or a 10 for the few historical inaccuracies.) It is also a heartbreaking movie, however this was a heartbreaking time. Lastly, I appreciate how this movie did not end when the civil war did, but instead continued on to the Reconstruction Era, which tells the truth of the fact the war for freedom was not over. The acting is phenomenal, and it is a story worth getting lost in."
