" A masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9377,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"I normally don't write a review for movies. For Tamasha, I would give a standing ovation. Beautifully depicted the shackles of society's expectations from you. The patterns you get sucked into without even realizing, and you feel helplessness to break free. Unfortunately it often takes a bigger event in life to shake you from that trans. I'm really proud of Indian cinema to make movies like this, entertaining yet a very powerful message delivered. DP and RK both have done an outstanding job!"

Ranbir's acting was top notch on every scenes he is GEM. Deepika's performance was good. The movie is about Escaping in to the day to day scheduled office life and etc. But it also has Multiple Personality Disorder. Good movie Underrated one.

" It's fresh and intriguing
",0.3182,0.9697,2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,"There's a beautiful message from this movie, that is we are forced to live life in the certain described ways and norms of the society or in other words we never get to live a life in our own way. That means somebody else decides our way of living, our past, our fate our destiny. In other words somebody else is writing our story(Tamasha) throughout our lives!! The plot somewhat enlightens us to break free from such boundaries because only then we will unleash our real potential.
Cinematography is great, and overall the movie feels very fresh and smooth. Deepika looks pretty and stunning, and with Ranbir!!!! Their chemistry is effortless and pure.
A must watch if you're not a robot !!!"

It's a storytelling in Imitiaz's original way and all the pieces just fit together so well that what one encounters is a true masterpiece.

",0.6115,0.9465,2020-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Got blown away by this piece of drama.Tamasha offers a perfect blend of beautiful storytelling and engaging content. From the picturesque of Corsica to the ""been there,done that"" sequences within the office cubicles, from Dev Anand's mimicry to those wonderful scenes of portrayal of despair, Tamasha has it all. Ranbir's character was so beautifully portrayed as if it was his biography. Deepika's Tara was on fleek as usual. The lives of the characters were so nicely interwined with their fantasy idols, the self realisation and awakening done remarkably, so much so that it created an extraordinary piece of drama on the screen. Imtiaz Ali, the master of the milieu brings the mesmerizing tale of two souls struck hard by cupid , but this time for some other repercussions. This movie is one of the most underrated movie as far as the box office performance is concerned, but this definitely deserves a watch."

Became a fan of Imtiaz Ali after watching Rockstar recently and now tamasha being the second one i experienced of his, i certainly gained more connect with his movies. Deepika was good enough and rabhir was upto to his caliber but ARR have just pushed his magic to next level where there was no scope for non sense music or tune."

",-0.2755,0.9454,2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,"Imtiaz Ali's most complex work. Although, it's only a story of a boy, who listened stories from a man who sat under a tree and narrated him so many tales that sometimes he got confused himself which tale he was referring to.Tamasha begins in Corsica. Ved meets a Tara, who after spending 7 days with him knows more about him than himself. Even than his family or his friends. Because - Ved wasn't allowed to be himself when he was with his family and was a 'robot' (metaphorically, depicted enough number of times in the movie) permitted to be polite, humble and be a person who has an acceptable behavior when in a social setting.Tara and Ved had decided not to reveal each others identity while in Corsica, because they can be anyone when they're not in their own ""worlds"".Tamasha ends with Ved performing a ""Shastaang Pranaam"" to his guru Tara, who was instrumental in bringing out the real storyteller that he is.This movie is filled with layers, with a non chronological storytelling, often misunderstood, or rather too complex for the 'run of the mill' movie audience. It has achieved a cult status like an Eternal Sunshine, and a fan following unmatched to any other romantic, psychological classic.THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE. AND YOU JUST CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT.Did you find your Teja ka khajana?"

" Worth Watching but slow narrative!
",0.1882,0.9742,2020-05-08 00:00:00,7,"Tamasha ,directed by Imtiaz Ali is overall a good film but not flawless. Infact,the film's biggest and most daunting flaw is in its narrative style and slow pace of story development.
What needs to be praised is way more than its faults. The cinematography is of superior class, editing is crisp, production design ,music,lyrics, locations are at the best level.
Deepika is stunning and has ood screen presence.
Ranbir is also praise-worthy in the film.His expressions and subtle acting is only for the class audience.
Direction is not for the 'masses'. Imtiaz kept it very confusing and skeptical for audience to understand his narrative style..So,in a nutshell TAMASHA is a good film with a message.It has not technical errors yet it is not something which everyone would love to watch.
Definitely you can give it a try once. I dont think it would be a big commercial triumph.."

Be it the cinematography, with some unique camera angles and choices. Be it writing, direction, acting, editing and incredible & meaningful music. Ranbir has delivered his best performance, talking with his eyes. Deepika is wonderful and its undoubtedly her best. The dialogues are on point, the supporting actors are amazing. This movie is life changing. There are 2 scenes in the movie when I cry everythime I watch it. It's poetic, its real, it's just flawless."

" Brilliant Masterpiece
",0.836,0.8792,2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,I watched this movie once and it didn't strike me much until i watched it another time and reminded me of all the struggles one goes through in late 20s with a childhood that didn't allow one to explore creativity in this case the character ranbir plays. Its a brilliant movie and certainly speaks a lot for a society that doesn't appreciate art and creativity as a profession or the seeking of one's true self.
" An Artistic Masterpiece

Imtiaz Ali is an artist of another world, if anything he showcases such natural human emotions which are hard to bypass through. You have to join in the journey with the protagonist say it Tamasha, Jab We Met or Highway whoever feels the emotion just joins him in the fable. This movie has changed my life whenever I am I a rut and confused about my career decisions. I wish whoever is reading this discovers his real self."

" Be your own storyteller - Tamasha : an avant-garde romance
",0.5574,0.9774,2020-01-20 00:00:00,9,"SPOILER FREEAfter watching Tamasha the first time, I didn't like it and passed it off as a pretentious exercise by the niche audience who imo reeked superiority complex. Some years later, I saw it again and as much wrong as I was, the movie took me by surprise. It is a beautiful amalgamation of stories that we grew up on, the dualities that we live in. It is a very personal experience and extremely divisive in nature. Imtiaz Ali continued the tradition of creating polarizing cinema but here it was a completely sincere take which should not be deemed over-indulgent. The avant-garde nature of it is very unlikely in the Indian cinema and the strong performances by its leads is its USP. The screentime for Deepika could've been more. The non-sequitr narrative is not that difficult to follow. Some brave choices by Ali..The cinematography was amazing. The foreshadowing and post-modernist touch is noteworthy. Our life on stage is indeed like of Ved's, just that it hasn't been presented like that. A touch more open-ended side would've made it a bit more better but it is still worth a watch. A modern classic in every sense."
" Game changer 😘👍👍👍
",0.0,0.9734,2020-01-05 00:00:00,10,"TAMASHA : Will be one of those movies that every one must watch atleast for once in their life time... Because the earlier you watch earlier ur game will change. Movie discusses about the mechanised mediocre life of today's generation youth. It showcases the common plot in every story parallely inspiring the viewers to make their's atleast not so common. It imparts a positive vibe to break out the cage and live your dream life as much as it is possible. Coming to the performances Ranbir and Deepika nailed it, especially the emotional scenes were so real that we are captured to the plot fully. Another over whelming aspect is its music by the maestro A R Rahman, it suited the plot so perfectly that everything seemed to be a poetic fairy tale in realistic frame. Imtiaz ali is a brilliant film maker and had repeated his magic of JAB WE MET, ROCKSTAR... once again....
Fav: 1. corsica scenes for their chemistry
2. Matargashti song
3. Restaurant scene where Deepika tries to convince Ranbir👌👌👌
4. Climax story telling at his house, the eye opener one."
" Insightful storytelling
",0.0,0.9237,2019-12-25 00:00:00,9,"It's a story of person which evolves from he being a ""lakeer ka fakeer"" to finding his true self. The narration of the movie is more insightful because it actually relates to many of us in real world who are busy running the race to an unknown destination. Simply put : herd mentality.The love angle is used as the source of inspiration to wake him up from his ""routine, robotic, resentful"" slumber. The protagonist's passion for role-play is used a layer to deepen the narration by portraying small but several parodies which touch the real facets of an urban mediocre.The beginning and climax is more poetic than it is apparent.RK and DP were brilliant. Limited role of Piyush Mishra is the sole of the movie and his performance is beyond words. I think this Imtiaz's most thoughtful works. One needs to understand his taste for life and
narration to get the bite."

I've watched it for like 7 times now. my opinion about the first half changed when I watched it for the second time. It takes a lot of attention to understand this part. I couldn't understand it when I watched it in the theater because i was too busy with my cellphone, so the blame's on me.Imtiaz's work has been exceptional most of the times, and he again managed to display his class with this fine movie. Ranbir and Deepika were apt picks for the roles of Ved and Tara, respectively. In fact, I would like to have someone exactly like Tara as my life partner, if I'm fortunate enough! I connected to this movie to an emotional level, and no movie has made this much of impact on me till date. If someone asks me what my favorite movie is, ""Tamasha"" is gonna be my answer.This movie is definitely not for those who still want some masala story. It's solely for those who appreciate the real cinematic art.PS: If it was possible, I would've rated this movie 11/10!!!!!!"

This probably the most complex script out of Imtiaz's vault since ""Rockstar"".Set in enchanting Corsica, it's the fictional world of self-made Don Ved and his muse Tara where they promise to act. Pretends to be the characters of which they always have dreamt of....break free, bindaas and hatke. A comfortable chemistry which led them to a rather unconventional sexual encounter without emotional attachment precisely, ""no strings attached"". A story where passion coincides mainstream dreams and sunk in reality.Imtiaz always remained utterly successful in portraying human psychologies. Depicting aberrations from the orthodox characteristics upon conspicuous events. Perplexed Viren, capricious Geet, a tormented rockstar Janardhan and now Ved, a storyteller lost in chasing mainstream dreams for a survival in so called society and ended up becoming a mediocre product manager who seeks aftermath of his story. This also reveals Ved's bi polar behavior engendered and fostered through an unending suffocation from complex rather confused thought of being turned down from beloved Tara.After SLB, it's Imtiaz who creates magic on celluloid with color, light and shadow. Tamasha lives up to that virtue of Imtiaz and takes you to his magnificent cinematic roller-coaster! Those marine drive across mediterranean Island, cobblestone streets, flowing red wine, gorgeous winding roads, costumes, uttered dialogues, metaphors...everything... just way too much sexy!!! Added with captivating cinematography and A R Rahman's score which tended to be banal on release except for Yagnik's scintillating ""Tum saath ho"" until you watch the flick. Now? It's pretty relatable and majestic as always.Ranvir was brilliant if not the best. His act justifies Ved in all aspect. From a fictional character, a metaphor, a bi polar, a byproduct of mainstream dreams and eventually a storyteller...isn't he a complete package! On the other hand, to me it's Deepika's best work till date. A Funky, steady and mature Tara precisely ""the sad heer"". It's Dipu and Ranvir's chemistry that supplies oxygen to the flick. Would never forget Ved's frequent comeback and finally Tara's approach of not letting Ved leave that night at bar grasping him as tight as she could until Ved's never-ending ego coincides. Tara's tears give you genuine ache!Apparently, Tamasha is not everyone's cup of tea. It's may not be a money spinner yet provokes your thought big time and remains as Imtiaz's most underrated work till date. It's not just the story of Ved and Tara nor his adrenalin rush from so called refusal nor the orthodox dreams for survival rather it's the depiction of human behavior within and beyond."

" Defies expectations
",0.0,0.7654,2019-05-17 00:00:00,7,"When I watched this movie I had assumed it was a cutesy romcom and when those expectations were not met it first filled me with disappointment, after all I just wanted a nice cutesy movie to calm down after a long day.
But days after watching this movie it still stayed with me and I started appreciating it for what it really was: a striking and heart-breaking exploration of mental health.
The romance is part of the plot and certainly triggers the drama of the movie but it is made perfectly clear that he does not break down due to heartbreak, heartbreak just acted as the straw that broke the camels back. The protagonist would have eventually broken down anyways.
The emotional highlight of the movie is not the lovers reconciling, it is Ved confronting his father about his life. It is the cry of help of ""I can't go on like this"".
Ranbir Kapoor's performance is spot on and is bound to give you goosebumps.
Especially as someone who has experienced mental health problems myself I can relate to the helplessness of the protagonist, the loss of control.
It is an amazing step into the right direction of portraying mental illness in movies and stretching the importance of living your best life.
It is also important to show that the main character is neither the Don role he played on Corsica nor the office-job Ved she rejects, he is an entirely unique person, a storyteller.
I have two critique points: although story telling is essential to the character I believe the childhood sequence could easily have been shorter. The second is that I don't like clowns, although that is of course completely subjective and arbitrary."

The only reason I can think of this happening is incorrect marketing. The promos sold the film as a rom-com which was just a layer of this cake. The movie subverted expectations and that probably did not go well with the audiences. The critics found the problems and the solutions of the film to be half baked. I do agree to an extent but it never bored me as most critics claimed. Definitely an A for effort for Imtiaz and team. And the music is the icing.

While the subject seems simple, it has been shown in depths as in turmoil being faced by Ranbir when he shouts in frustration while doing Math in his teens, his vivid imagination to story telling in his childhood, hating to fight himself in else's shoes when Deepika discovers his real-self. Such unpredictable scenes requires an actor be in his fullest form and Ranbir aced it. Imtiaz Ali deserves best out-of-the-box director award for his work in Tamasha.Being said, Deepika displayed subtle emotions very well through out the movie and you'd never feel like she lost her pace acting beside Ranbir.

Slow burn story, exceptional acting and a very weak screenplay. In paper the film looks interesting. But it's just blatantly boring on the screen, but just for the first half. They tried to make it a commercial film by adding Corsica-a beautiful foreign land and a few useless songs. But when the fake commercialisation is over, then Imtiaz and Ranbir comes back in form, they explore this character Ved so deeply and with so many layers that I forgot that I'm watching a Bollywood film. The second half is that good.
Honestly speaking, this movie is bound to be a commercial disaster, which it was. 
Imtiaz was a phenomenal revelation in the early days through his first 4-5 movies. Now he's out of fuel and trying to make something new out of his old formula. He was a damn good writer and a master at direction. But unfortunately his time is up.
After Jab Harry Met Sejal, I doubt any Bollywood A list actor would want to work with him again. He's distracted now a days. Not at his best anymore.
Personally I want the Imtiaz of Rockstar to come back and make a few more of those gems. 
The movie was great. The concept was ripped if from 3 idiots. But the 9 stars I've given to the film is for Ranbir Kapoor only and AR Rahman's music. Hindi audience will never know what a blessing they've got in the shape of Ranbir Kapoor."

Imtiaz Ali is one of most imperfectly perfect director. His works has flaws but what works for him everytime is that how he tells the story. How he manages to tell the same story again and again so beautifully in each of his films. I admire his craft. This could be his best work in terms of showcasing complex emotions. Ranbhir Kapoor is marvelous as a confused man. Deepika Padukone is so irresistable. You can't take your eyes off because of her performance and beauty. Cinematography by Ravi Varman is fabulous. Aarti Bajaj's editing is another highlight of the film. A R Rahman's scores are lovely as always. Songs plays a vital part in narration. TAMASHA is a Treat for Imtiaz Ali fans."

The movie is about a character who has his own qualities but can't pursue those due to the race in which everyone is running but no one is getting nowhere. This subject of pursuing self-interest can't be told better than this. Imtiaz Ali really hats-off to you. You are trully a cinematic genius. Ranbir kapoor gave his career best. From performance to editing to direction everything thing is top-notch. Special credit should be given to dialog writer for giving such amazing in-depth words of wisdom. Thank you for giving us such a great motion picture that will last with some of us for forever.
" Life's a Spectacle!
",0.0,0.9985,2017-12-08 00:00:00,8,"Tamasha begins with a stage play wherein Ranbir acts as a robot. The play there seemed to be completely illogical at that point of time, but as the same play was repeated at the end we clearly understand it. Ranbir Kapoor, the hero, plays Ved Sahni, he is cool, good looking and dramatic. He lends his phone to Tara played by Deepika Padukone who wants to make an urgent call. That's the way they meet. Tara is gorgeous and attractive. She totally gets engaged with him in Corsica. They decide that they won't let their relationship be the usual one; for this reason they don't even tell their real names to each other. The first half is funny and entertaining. It amuses you the way Deepika gets amused by Ranbir. She kinda falls for Ved because of his witty and cool nature. The song shot in Corsica titled 'Matargashti' completely illustrates Ved's madness and dramatic behavior. Imtiaz Ali makes another masterpiece after his first major break, Jab We Met. But Tamasha doesn't cater to almost all sorts of the audience, there may be many of them who might feel that this film doesn't create any sort of magic in their minds or hearts but frankly speaking the film itself is a magic created by the magician named Imitiaz Ali. His direction is accomplished and proficient. The screenplay is non- linear, it shows Ved on three different stages of his life i.e childhood, boyhood, and the matured one. Ranbir plays Ved as a young one and a matured one. The screenplay is fast, funny, appealing, and emotional in the second half. Ranbir is excellent as Ved. At some point of time we find Ved being inane. He makes you think that he requires a psychologist for his immature behavior. Later things get revealed and we see the reasons behind this and at least one thing is proved that our hero is not a psycho. Deepika also plays her role well. Tara loves Ved, she loves almost everything in Ved. In the second half things take a tragic turn in her life. Things aren't in the right place. Tamasha is all about finding who you are. Being yourself, living yourself. It's not good to compulsorily establish yourself as 'mediocre' or 'average'. It's about running in such a race in which you will come first rather than running in a rat race and landing almost nowhere."
" Do watch the movie and if not anything, you'll walk away admiring Ranbir
",0.3818,0.9828,2017-11-06 00:00:00,8,"Tamasha, (literarily translated as drama), although brought in front of the audience through the medium of cinema, is presented as a drama itself, with multiple acts, which starts with Teja's gold and ends with Don returns. Imitiaz aces in bringing out the best in ranbir, while presenting a story which is both endearing as well as disturbing. Endearing to view as an audience, to see the 3rd generation 'Hero' waltz us through the story, you smile as much as deepika does when you meet him in delhi, are dumbstruck when he behaves as he does n cringe at his dialogues, you want to beat the daylight out of him when he mouths dialogues which we use everyday (Corporates are the new countries). Then we see his metamorphosis, coming out of his cocoon through some hilarious scenes and wonderfully performed mirror talks. Disturbing for you, if you can feel, empathize n realize that you may also be doing exactly what the Hero does in his mediocre life, and maybe hoping deep inside for a Corsica or Tara to happen to you.Special performance by Piyush Mishra, cute acts by Jr.ranbir and credits to Rahman and Imtiaz for deeply integrating music into the medium. The back n forth narrative reminds me of rockstar.Do watch the movie and if not anything, you'll walk away admiring Ranbir, and hoping that he continues to be in good hands of talented directors.Life is a tamasha."

" This masterpiece will be remembered,cherished and missed.
",0.4404,0.9795,2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, this movie wouldn't resonate with the masses. Nah! The reason being the stupid spoon feeding Indian audiences are generally used to. Catchy words, item songs and machismo in fight scenes are what we are used to. And then someone suddenly comes to tell you 'please don't leave your brain at home this time while you come and watch'. Neither should you the heart! Well, that's what it is all about. This is one of those rare movies which doesn't put you at the edge of the seat but makes you sit back, relax and think. The master story teller just delivered a master piece. Be it poetic emotions, out of the box writing or the extravaganza of music by god himself (A R Rahman). Ranbir Kapoor nails it so hard that it will touch your complex emotions. He is so damn sure about the role of Ved that he lives it with you. Deepika proves yet again the role of a woman in a Bollywood film is not limited to kisses and dances. Her magnificent understanding of Tara just takes the film to a level never reached before. All the supporting cast including Piyush Mishra come for a purpose. Instill that purpose in your mind along with Ved's and leave gracefully. Finally, I bow down to Imtiaz Ali's vision and creation on the screen. This is a perfect movie. No wonder many couldn't get it. Down the lane, farther in time, when people have moved over the khan's,the catchy phrases and the item songs. When people start recognising art and not the formula, class and not the masala this movie will be remembered, cherished and missed. All, forever !"

" Tamasha is as beautiful as it is dark.
",0.5994,0.8735,2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"What really happens in Tamasha is a story of a bipolar person(Ved). Ved is usually very functional. He can take care of himself, daily routines and everything, but at given moments and situations, he loses it. It helps that he comes from a good family, or people like him would usually end up on the streets because of the unfortunate lack of support system in society. Ved, however, is not the only person who does something off. The story-teller, Ved's father and even Ved's boss have their own off-ness to them. But we usually find these people everywhere in our day-to-day lives and they seem to do fine and get on with life. Tara does something off too. She searches for a guy she met four years ago, she movies to another city, stalks a bookstore where there was a high change to bump into him and lies first when she accidentally does bump into him. We do that, as people. It's all too real. We strategically walk part someone so they notice us and come talk to us. Case in point Tara. This movie is too deep and meta and beautifully made. Thank you for making it and letting people know they are not the only one who does these kind of things."

But I'll say this is best of it. Rockstar was complete package then highway.amazing. Expectations of the people was really high but they didn't get one thing that every common story has its own depth. Tamaashaa is one of them. I completely agree that story was little excuse to the movie but Ali's direction cover up all this. Now performances. Ranbir is at his best. Deepika as usual charming and no need to prove that she can act. And then there is Piyush mishra. He is most underrated actor of the industry. He nailed as a story teller. Now music. A.R. Rahman is not at his best but just like i said even at his worst he is best. Overall movie is must watch. This is the tribute to those who's on wrong path of the career.

There was not a moment in the film that felt out of place, and the big takeaway that one has to write their own story of their life is well presented."

",0.0,-0.7903,2017-02-07 00:00:00,3,"I don't understand why Indian film industry don't have good writers. They make big budget films comparison to world cinema and what budget it used to be and now where they are. Instead of paying to big actors and using latest cameras and special effects. I would say pay bit more to a writer and get some original scripts and story or invest in writers and promote writing as Indian industry need that badly as 95 percent of films are copy of something if not Hollywood then French, Korean, Spanish etc. I was literally yawning and bored through out apart from watching beautiful Corsica that was the only good thing about the film ""the island"" otherwise silly unrealistic story with over acting and jokes trying too hard with references to old films. Bad acting, bad direction, awful jokes and awful story line. After watching ""Ae dil ha mushkil"" and ""Kapoor and Sons"" I started to think they started making good films again but nope. It is definitely over rated on here, don't deserve a 7."

I would have seen a billion movie since the time i have been born and would have read a million reviews on IMDb but never in my life i thought of writing a review here, so of course this is my first and honestly i don't know where to begin from...This movie personally for me has been the biggest wake up call, i have never been jolted so much by just a movie before. This is a tight slap on the face of ugly corporate world... Which many of us have been and still are suffering by it. Yes this movie is not for people who have never seen the face of corporate world, so it will be unfair for those to comment on how this movie is and in a way it's unfair for the movie too! Beautifully acted by Ranbir (i am not a big fan of his work but totally blown away in this one) The story is by far the best of my life... Maybe a bit biased as i can connect to it. Totally love the movie and thanks for bringing an awesome movie on such a serious subject... Cheers!"
" Get into the depth and fall in love with Tamasha

Gradually, as the plot progresses, we feel a bit lost and we ultimately give up. Then after a few days we start reading it again, and the words seem to convey a new meaning to us, opening a new interpretation of the story which urges us to carry forward with it. After multiple trials and errors, when we get the full grip on the plot, we find ourselves completely immersed in it and in someway or the other we find that, it has been the story of our own life that has been said all along or that of a very known acquaintance. Either way, we start feeling connected to it. Tamasha, as a movie, can be compared to a book of this kind. The greater number of times it is watched, the more the feeling of realization will sink in your heart. The story of the two protagonists, is something that every millennial will find connected to. As far as acting goes, words really fall short to describe the acting prowess shown by the two leads, Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone. The varied range of emotions, that the script demands, has been aptly portrayed by them,be it the friendly lighter moments or the moments of loss,heartbreak, pain and self discovery. It has been carried out with elan by both of them. Though, this movie does have some similarities with Imtiaz Ali's previous films in bits and parts like 'Love Aaj Kal'and 'Rockstar', he does deliver the old concepts of romance, ambition and values of life in a very refreshing way. The story has been told in a non-linear style, which is definitely very refreshing. In some parts, the script has some flaws, which often threatens the continuity, but the story is enough to make you forget them quickly. And last, but not the least, A.R. Rahman's music, be it the songs or the background score, add a different dimension to the movie itself and helps in carrying out the narrative."
