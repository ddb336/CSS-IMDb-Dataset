" This film is an art.

" Girl Power!
",0.0,0.8883,2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Like an ocean liner setting out to sea, it takes a fleet of tugs to move it from its moorings. But once it sets sail, ""Carol"" vividly illustrates the institutionalized oppression of women as recently as the 1950s. Patricia Highsmith was one of the very best novelists of the period. The production values provide excellent atmospherics for the developing passion of Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett)---a reference to Violet Leduc, author of ""Therese and Isabelle?"" The sex scene is brief and restrained. The patronization of women by the men in their lives, their bullying and brutality, and the male-dominated legal profession, which crafts laws and interprets them, forms the cage of second class citizenship, as shown here."
" Slow but excellent lesbian love story
",0.9161,0.905,2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,This is set in 1950s New York. Unhappily married Carol (Cate Blanchett) meets young Therese (Rooney Mara). They develop a friendship which slowly becomes a love affair. However Carol is divorcing her husband and involved in a nasty custody battle for their only child. If it's found out she's a lesbian she loses custody. What to do?Slow but never dull. Beautifully directed by Todd Haynes with a great eye for how the 1950s looked. There's also a great script and two powerhouse performances by Mara and Blanchett. The one sex scene shown is explicit yet tastefully done. My only complaint is that it is slow. Still it's well worth seeing.
" The Joys Of Being Miserable
",0.0,0.34,2021-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Rooney Mara is manning a desk at a department store when mink-coated Cate Blanchett comes by to figure out what she can buy for her son's Christmas. When Miss Blanchett departs, she leaves her gloves. Miss Rooney calls her to rturn them and soon they begin an affair.It's a movie based on a novel Patricia Highsmith published under a pen name lest she be typed as a writer of homosexual fiction. Todd Haynes directs coldly, with the early 1950s reproduced in a perfect exhibition of set design, and while the leading ladies are, as you might expect, perfect, it's yet another Highsmith adaptation that leaves me unmoved Everyone is is either clueless, predatory, or both, and Edward Lachman's lighting leaves everyone looking bloodless. Yes, I get it. The Old Days were terrible; no one could be themselves, everyone had to pretend, and everyone was miserable. I'm left with the thought of John Sullivan grinding ten thousand feet of hard luck, and wondering when someone is going to shove him back to Hollywood so he can make ANTS IN YOUR PLANTS OF 1942.Carter Burwell's score is in a minor key, of course."
" Masterful Performances, Envisioned Directing
",0.0,0.9913,2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,"8 stars of 10. Cate Blanchett & Rooney Mara star alongside each other and they both deliver masterpiece performances. The subtleties that Blanchett is able to deliver in this film are magical, and as in so many of her films, she simply leaves a person asking if there is anyone that can deliver the craft of acting better? Blanchett almost always brings to the forefront of my mind the thought that she either is or among the best Actors on the planet.And Rooney Mara keeps up with Blanchett and is just as good, delivering a performance that peels back layers that few could do without overreaching.Sarah Paulson stars alongside Blanchett and Mara and puts on a superb performance with intricacies that simply work brilliantly, like the twiddling of her lit cigarette in the diner scene with Mara, simple but intricate, little but big, controlled but chaotic.This is all tied together by Todd Haynes. Haynes delivers another great film and as he usually does, he creates an aura of creativity which allows performers to perform while having his vision shine through; great directing from a great Director."
" Distant in more ways than one
",0.0,0.9269,2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,"It took me forever to see this and I'm not sure why as I've always wanted to. Sometimes you just don't get around to some films and then they fade in interest. I have little to offer from other reviews. It's a beautiful production in nearly every capacity and the acting by the two leads is very fine. For a forbidden love story it is very reserved and I suppose that fits in with the era that it takes place in (the early 1950's), but for me it was also its main flaw. I didn't feel the passion they had for each other and far too many scenes of them staring into each other's eyes didn't quite compensate for that. Still, I again have to say that it's an honest stance for this era. Certainly not for everyone as it's very slow moving, but it's a must for serious cinema lovers."
" Just a perfect mix
",0.5719,0.9885,2021-02-04 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. You do not need to be a lesbian to adore it.
It is just the perfect mix between beauty, love, music ,hope. It flows like a poetry .Great end and great director. Of course great actors.
To see and review."
" Fantastic despite having a few issues
",0.5574,0.9962,2021-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Carol is very good film. It has an engaging and intriguing story and the setting makes it super interesting. The film is edited and directed very well, despite having just a few issues with it. There were a bunch of shots included of moments that needed explanation, but they never were. Towards the end of the film something happens that endangers the two main characters, and it's never explained how it happened. It's hard to talk about without spoiling the film, but this element is crucial to the story and the occurrence doesn't make sense in context with the story. The writing was mostly pretty good, but I feel like they could've bettered the romance aspect, I feel like they never fell in love at times, you barely see them laugh or just talk about their life and their story, and I think we should've gotten more of that. Just maybe one or two scenes more with stuff, it's not too a big of a deal, but I think it would better the film. There were also a few minor issues that aren't worth mentioning. Despite all of that, it's very good, it has great writing, great editing, great direction, and an overall excellent story. This is a very well crafted film despite having a few issues. I rate Carol an 8/10."
" Talk about star-crossed lovers!
",0.5707,0.9944,2021-01-21 00:00:00,9,"This is a beautiful love story about two star-crossed lovers who could not have been more different in temperament and circumstance. One is naive and the other is quite sophisticated. And yet, there is an undeniable mutual attraction that they feel for each other. The movie is shot with such nuance that it's a sheer pleasure to watch. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, are incredibly gorgeous and talented actresses. The film captures their beauty and craft in an effortless manner. Their subtle and sincere portrayal of two people in love is quite effective. Every time their eyes meet in the movie, own can feel the palpable connection between the two.Carol is a desperate woman who is in an unhappy marriage, fearful of losing the custody of her daughter, while Therese (with an Audrey Hepburn kind of look, or is it just me?) has a job that she dislikes and a relationship that is unsatisfying. As the movie proceeds, we see how these unhappy people provide each other with a perfect partner. Carol gifts Therese a camera and a muse which allows her to pursue her long-cherished dream of becoming a photographer. Therese, in her gentle, innocent and non-pushy way, lets Carol gather her thoughts and take control of her life. However, the circumstances are piled against them. The world in 1950s wasn't so ready to understand that love comes in all forms. This movie is thus a very gentle reminder of how difficult it must have been for some people to be able to spend their lives with who they truly loved.A deeply sensitive and moving portrayal of how love is one of the most basic of emotions, and how it could not and would not be denied!"
" Magnificent, beautiful, flung out of space
",0.8316,0.994,2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,"OMY GOSH! OMY GOSH!!!
I've no words. I had been avoiding this movie for a long time and now I completely regret watching it after 5 years of its release. I didn't expect the movie to be so beautiful. I was moved by it. I thought it would be a typical cliche love story but oh boi did I know I was wrong. Everything is so beautiful about this movie. Cate and Ronnie have good chemisty together. The tunnel scene was one of the best scene in the whole movie. Their love making scenes were absolutely breathe taking. I could feel their desire and love for each other. This is one of the best love story I have ever watched beside Portrait of Lady on Fire. We need more movies like this!"
" Outstanding, amazing
",0.8316,0.8925,2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful movie, cried a lot. The whole issue with being gay in the 1950s is really shown in a great way. Cate and RooneyÂ´s performances are outstanding in my opinion. Go and watch this movie right now."
" A rare miss for Blanchett and a fairly tedious film all around.
",-0.1531,0.9978,2021-01-11 00:00:00,5,"I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett, and have loved her in almost everything she does. Her ability to make a low-key character as credible as a high-energy character. Or to make a working class woman as believable as a wealthy and powerful women. She's great in pretty much anything, and I've bought movies knowing nothing about them except that they starred Cate Blanchett.I don't care for her too much in CAROL, and in fact, I don't care much for the film. I can accept a film that is quiet, where passions are banked and never allowed to burst into full flame (or at least, not often). But I don't actually want to be lulled to sleep by the film. But there are long stretches that are infuriating because they are a) slow paced & b) there doesn't really seem to be anything happening in the inner-lives of the characters either. CAROL takes the concept of meaningful glances or the exchange of smoldering looks to a degree where sometimes it feels that this is all the film is really about.Blanchett plays a bored wife (Carol) of a well-to-do man (Kyle Chandler) who is under something resembling occasional house-arrest for a ""romance"" she had with an old female friend (Sarah Paulsen). Essentially, she had an affair, one exacerbated by the fact that it took place with a woman (oh, did I mention, this is the early '50s). On one of her rare trips ""into the city"", Carol shops in the toy department of a big department store, and exchanges glances with the shopgirl (Rooney Mara) who helps her decide on a gift for her daughter. The scene clearly must mean something, because it goes on for a long time. Yet I never felt any passion stirring or smoldering or any HEAT. But Mara is clearly stricken by Blanchett, and when she realizes the lady has left a personal item behind on accident, she sends it back to Carol, and this small kindness leads to Mara spending more and more time with Carol. Apparently, they have the hots for each other, but we sure don't see it for the LOOONGEST time!I get it...in the '50s, feelings of desire for the same-sex were, shall we say, frowned upon and needed to be kept carefully hidden. But CAROL fumbles because it takes so much time avoiding anything coming to the surface even when the two women are alone together. Mara's character is conceived as a bit of a simpleton (in my mind). I suppose she's supposed to be naive and that these feelings are new to her (except they aren't, as we find out in scenes with her friendly but oblivious boyfriend). She seems somewhat out of touch with her own feelings. And occasionally she sounds like she's drunk...her speech slurs and her articulated thoughts meander.But Blanchett is the biggest miss here. I would have expected those relentlessly silent scenes, or the ones where characters talk about one thing when clearly they're thinking of something else, to have had more impact thanks to her ability to convey her inner life so well. She's done it before (NOTES ON A SCANDAL jumps to mind). But here she seems nearly vacuous. She seems to be striving towards a sensuousness that she's having to keep hidden...and she certainly keeps it hidden (I feel bad bashing her so much, but in my opinion, she is just simply not that good here.)The movie essentially follows the development of their relationship and also shows its impact on the lives of the men who love them. The ending is actually interesting and in some ways a bit surprising and unexpected. It might even have been stirring if only we cared one bit about these two characters.So why do I even give the film as many as 3 stars. Well, first of all, the production & costume design is impeccable. The toy department in which Mara works is a nostalgic delight (I wasn't alive then, but it just felt so completely RIGHT). Mara, despite my overall dislike of her character, has moments that are quite nice. The final 20 minutes or so of the film finally kick into a bit of a higher gear (thank goodness) and rescue it from complete forgetability.I know that this film just racked up some Oscar nominations, including for Blanchett. So clearly I am not in the majority regarding this film. But when a film is about PASSION, whether on open display or carefully hidden, I still need to feel that passion, either because it's openly represented, or clearly building beneath the surface. Instead, I'm left to infer what these characters are feeling, and if I don't care about them much, I'm not willing to make that kind of effort or investment. When the film was over, my wife and I discussed the film for awhile...we were both in agreement that it was not great, and so our discussion was about why the film was held in such high acclaim. We never settled on a definitive answer, because this is so subjective to start with. But in the end, I have to stick with my gut feelings...CAROL just doesn't work."
" Such a beautiful love story
",0.8442,0.9934,2020-12-30 00:00:00,9,"Carol is one of those films that draws you in and has you on tenterhooks from start to finish. It is so stylish, so thoughtful, so tender and achingly beautiful.This is in no small part due to the performances of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, who are both stunning. Cate Blanchett just had this visceral aura around her in this film which was so captivating. I can't remember the last time I was this drawn into a performance. The chemistry between the two of them was spot on, and they played the characters perfectly.Speaking of the characters, they were so interesting and well crafted, making them feel so real and authentic I loved the arc of both of them, and was so invested in them and their journeys.The story is so beautiful, and felt very real, full of genuine emotion and heart. I loved the screenplay. It was so slow and gentle in a poignant way, and had so many beautiful moments.As well as all of this, the film was shot perfectly. It has a great score and every shot was oozing style and suspense.Carol is one of those films that deserves all of its plaudits. Absolutely stunning."
" ""I release you""
",0.0,0.979,2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,One of the best love stories ever in the big screen. The script is amazing the chemistry between the two leads is excellent . The cinematography as the colours with this brilliant music are maybe one of the best I have ever seen .
" Not an easy story

" A perfectly orchestrated film that's a dreamy experience
",0.6369,0.9878,2020-12-09 00:00:00,9,"It's a romantic drama about two women falling in love in the 50s. Rooney Mara plays a quiet young woman who still isn't quite sure about the purpose of life, and Cate Blanchett plays a sophisticated woman who's going through a tough divorce. It's based on a 1952 romance novel ""The Price of Salt"" that was pretty popular at the time.Everything about this has drawn me toward it. It's quiet and mesmerizing. The whole look of the film feels authentic, it's grainy and its toned-down color, feel like something that's made in the 70s. It boasts nuanced performances, and cinematography which brings a sense of sincerity to it. I honestly can't find a flaw in it, except the relationship that's formed between the two, felt a bit distant at times, although the more I think about it, it could've been intentional. The film is perfectly orchestrated and I had a wonderful experience watching it."
" A film of class & elegance
",0.4767,0.9353,2020-12-06 00:00:00,8,"This picture exudes an old sense of class & elegance. And the way it demonstrates so is through the outstanding and superb use of cinematography. I mean, my goodness me the cinematography is breathtaking and mesmerizing. If I'm not mistaken, the very underrated director Todd Haynes chose his cinematographer Ed Lachman to shoot the film using a 16mm in order to give it an older aesthetic and it was impeccably beautiful. Probably in my top 5 films with inspiring cinematography ever.The way the story ebbs & flows is just so natural, it's different from any other love story, and than other gay love story. The plot is natural, the chemistry between Cate and Rooney is marvelousl well-directed and well-written. And the dramas that the two individually experiences throw out the film is so aligned with the archetypal struggles that many gay women go through, not just that but the dramas are in harmony with the ages of the two women - Carol is stuck in her generation's struggle which is marriage and custody and an envious husband; Therese is stuck in her generation's struggle of a young woman's life infused by the idea and pressures of marriage and men's pursuit for her.Last but not least, that performance by Cate Blanchett is one of the very few acting performances I can proudly describe as ""mindblowing"" and it blew my mind. Blew. My. Mind. I've watched this picture 3 times and it never fails to stimulates my artistic impulse."
" Lovely

" A story of discovering self-fulfillment against the backdrop repressive post WW2 family values
",0.0772,0.9743,2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Carol (played by Cate Blanchett) is introduced in the movie as somebody who lives a life of wealth and privilege as she is shopping for a Christmas gift for a young girl. Therese (Rooney Mara) is the shop clerk that helps Carol and returns some gloves to Carol that she forgot at Therese's shop. This interaction piques both characters' interest in each other.The film is set in post-WW2 New York City and portrays some of the more conservative family values that seemed to be very prevalent around that time.As the plot unfolds, we find that Carol is in a failing marriage to Harge (Kyle Chandler) and has a daughter with him. Harge is a man that comes from a very conservative family that surrounds themselves with the high-society types. Within this dynamic, we see that Carol has been very suffocated for a good part of her marriage to Harge and is striving to break free to find her own individual contentment. He and his family characterize her ""unorthodox"" lifestyle decisions, such as sleeping with other women, as immoral and reprehensible to the point of stalking her and privately filming her in order to use the ""evidence"" in a messy custody battle for their daughter.Other reviews have mentioned that this is a love story, but I saw it as a story of self-realization, with her relationship with Therese as a driving force toward this end. Therese is much younger than Carol and has her entire life ahead of her. She is also on her own journey of self-discovery. Toward the end of the film, we see Therese starting out her own career, through the path that she made for herself. Many of the deeper intricacies of the plot are implied, such as when Carol gifts a nice camera to Therese that tells us she is supportive of Therese's endeavors to go out and make a life for herself - the kind of life that Carol has been looking for her entire life. A life of freedom to do what she wants on her own terms."
" WHAT A ROMANCE.
",0.5574,0.9622,2020-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Love how Cate and Rooney played their characters. The silence and exchanged gazes in the film speak so much volume of the romance between them.

" Wonderful performances to be experienced and a simple story to be heard
",0.5719,0.986,2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,"I decided to watch this movie on a plane from Toronto to Calgary. Main reasons being; I needed to see Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara's performance since they got nominated for an Oscar and all, but even more so because this was a movie about two women who loved each other in a not so liberal time. It was slated to be significant for LGBTQ+ community and so to be interested in this movie and to praise it, reflects your left wing, equality seeking righteousness. I want to be viewed that way. I want to have watched this movie and loved it so that one day when I'm talking to someone and they bring it up I could say, ""It was a prodigious movie. A unique look at lesbians in a significant time period where injustice was the norm. It may just be one of the most important movies for the LGBTQ+ community."" And I would mean it while being slightly facetious.It's a slow and quiet story that relies on the flawless performances of their two leading ladies. A little predictable but if you just enjoy the journey it will leave you breathless."
" Style and Substance
",0.0,0.9989,2020-08-22 00:00:00,9,"My Review Carol -
My Score 9/10
I rewatched Carol last night and thought as I hadn't reviewed it on IMBD in 2015 when it was released that it deserved one today .
Carol had a long journey to the Screen ,it was in development since 1997, when Phyllis Nagy wrote the first draft of the screenplay based on the novel ""The Price of Salt"" by Patricia Highsmith.
A GLBTQI film and a Lesbian Love story back then saw the eyes of Studio Executives glaze over and ask for the next script.
It was also difficult to find two top notch actresses who would risk their career and reputation to take on the roles of Carol Aird and Therese Belivet.
Thank goodness they waited for Cate Blanchett to play Carol the sophisticated wealthy stylish and beautiful wife in the throws of a messy separation from husband Harge and Rooney Mara as Therese the much younger elfin like shop assistant working in the toy department of a large New York Department store.
When their chance encounter first occurs Carol is looking for a Christmas gift for her child and the sexual energy in their first glance sets the scene for a tempestuous affair that will have consequences in each woman's life.
I watched an Actors discussion show recently with Cate Blanchett and Sir Ian McKellen and they compared this story to the famous film Brief Encounter .
I agree it moved me the first time I saw it and more on second viewing.
I think unlike other films with lesbian characters like The Killing of Sister. George "" which is a great film as well but in my observation Carol is unique as it shows the pain, discrimination and inequality of the law in 1952 for male and female homosexuals alike.
If a traditional heterosexual couple had an affair outside their marriage ,as long as it was with the opposite sex the parents of that marriage at least usually would be granted equal rights of access to their children but same sex no way it was seen as a moral danger and the scene in the lawyers office between husband and wife in Carol is dramatically tense and emotionally charged with sadness and cruelty.
Carol is a great companion film to the great 2002 film ""Far from Heaven."" set in the same early 1950's era with the opposite scenario in ""Far From Heaven "" it's the husband who is gay and the wife who is left alone.
It's no accident I realised as Todd Haynes directed ""Far from Heaven "" also as well as
Carol .Todd Haynes has a superb sense of style and emotional instinct . It's no wonder both actresses in these movie Julianne Moore and Cate Blanchett deservedly were nominated for Best Actress Academy Awards for their performances.
Carol is a stylish movie and very entertaining a little slow in parts but it needs to be to build the emotion and tension I'm glad both films were huge Box office successes.
Carol premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2015, Grossing over $42 million on an $11 million budget, the film was praised for Haynes's direction and the performances of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, and was the best-reviewed film of 2015. Carol competed for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, where Rooney Mara tied for the Best Actress award. The film received many accolades, including five Golden Globe Award nominations, six Oscarnominations, and nine BAFTA Award nominations; as well as five Dorian Awards and awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and National Society of Film Critics. It featured prominently in several ""best of"" film lists.
I must mention the wonderful film score of Carol by Carter Burwell it's an example of music adding so much emphasis on the action and the dialogue. He's composed so many great scores for movies like Fargo, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Twilight In Bruges a favourite of mine also the elegant costumes of designer Sandy Powell that make Cate and Rooney look fabulous and authentic to the 1950's I'm certain Rooney Mara was influenced by Audrey Hepburn in this role ,perhaps because Audrey also appeared in a lesbian themed film in 1961 ""The Children's Hour"" although the theme of Lillian Hellman's play was a little sanitised for that time it's still a great film (perhaps a remake is called for?)"
" It was alright.
",0.25,0.4874,2020-07-26 00:00:00,7,"Initially I wasn't really that interested in this film, cos 1 - it seemed a bit middle of the road, didn't seem to have much spark to it personality-wise. And 2 - it looked really white, and I've cumulatively seen way, WAY too many monocultured white films. Then a little later, out of desperation for gay content in my life, got this subsequent urge to watch any and all lgbtq+ movies I could find. THAT'S what brought the film back to my attention, and birthed this imdb list.And in terms of cinema, it is a beautifully-shot, emotionally tense feature. Carol is majestic as all hell, and definitely has ""Big Dick Energy"". really she makes the film. However, a lot of the drama relies too heavily on subtext to really get you going in my opinion. And it's so white, which at this point in 21st century cinema, forms part of a trend that, given all we know, is statistically just inexcusable.I don't like the idea of LGBTQ+ films having a gay relationship as the only point of the story. It's such a simplistic and frankly quite straight perspective, and I just find it patronising. Of course straight people are going to think queer sexualities are the most interesting thing about us.As a queer person, I definitely know our lives are more complex than that. There's queer friendship, there's finding your personality, there's chosen family, there's navigating academia, there's music, there're unique perspectives on sexism, on the working world... I could go on and on. More comedy, more action, more sci-fi, more varied subject matter, more twists and turns in gay cinema please."

And for the first time, she invited Theresa to go home, picked up her daughter and went straight to the door of the house, let guests prepare refreshments in the kitchen and play with her daughter in the living room ...
Perhaps it was such a lack of care that she always had the ability to master the initiative, and Theresa who loved too much could only moth the fire without turning back.
Is it because my insecurity is starting to wrestle and nitpick?"

Every single time they make a change from the book it makes it a worse film.As soon as I finished the book, famed for being the first lesbian book that had an even remotely happy ending, I decided to watch the film right after, expecting that it would be worse, but willing to hold it on its own merit. But with perhaps the only exception of changing Therese's profession to something more modern, every change made from the book to the movie made it a weaker story.I won't get into the details to avoid spoiler tags, but honestly, there are better, older lesbian films. This one doesn't deserve the acclaim it received."

Individual characterization is very good and interesting (despite some overdramatized scenes and some not so great acting by the male characters). But the main problem I had with this film was the development of their relationship. The two are often sitting in silence even in the latter half of the movie. The only true signs of romantic affection we see between the characters is when they have sex, making their relation seem quite superficial. Considering the ratings from the critics I was expecting something great, especially since good romantic movies are very hard to come by. But I left feeling disappointed."

",0.6369,0.9993,2020-02-03 00:00:00,8,"I saw Carol for the first time on my own and I must admit that I didin't pay enough attention to it. I didn't get it at the time and frankly speaking found it quite boring. But then I saw it again not so long ago with my school and I must say that I was absolutely blown away by it's magnificence.The movie's really beautifully crafted and is worth watching at least twice to understand it at it's fullest. The effort that was put in subtleties, as Todd Haynes usally does in his films, were here a really important element for the movie's whole plot and beauty. The small touches, lingering eye contact and small talk were perfectly executed by the two amazing actresses that are Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. We could see all the unsaid things between the two female lead characters and I was just here for it!Rooney Mara as the young, reserved and unsure woman of 1950's did a pretty good job and was easy to relate to, we could see why Carol saw her as an ""angel flung from space"". Cate Blanchett was as elegant and sophisticated as she could be. I honestly wouldn't have seen any other person than her in this role. I like the fact that Kyle Chandles as Carol's husband character wasn't exagerating his reactions and facial expressions. In fact, it seemed so realistic, like a real daily life husband was actually going through this situation.There were many important issues here and they were all nicely put together and expressed the right way for us to understant them. Homosexuality, the divorce Carol's going through, motherhood and how women were treated in general at that time. The score was very good and the clothing style as well as the movie's settings were truly amazing. I felt like it looked pretty accurate to what the 1950's in the US were like.Most importantly, I liked the love story between Carol and Therese. It didn't seem forced at all. It was just two people falling in love with each other and being scared of their feelings. Until the very end it stayed that way. We were shown just the right amount of love and affection to feel as if it was an authentic love story, it wasn't a clichÃ© at all. Also, I just can't get over the end : a full of emotion ""I love you"" from Carol and a final look between the two lovers said it all, like it did in the beginning when Carol and Therese first met."

Cate Blanchett is just awesome, beautiful and more charismatic than ever, in the company of Rooney Mara who plays Therese like nobody could have done. And what a story! These two women that are meant to be together just made me feel like there's no ""impossible love"". We are captured by all the tension of the movie, we really feel sad for Carol who risks losing her daughter just because she loves women but fights to keep her without denying who she really is. This movie makes us reflect about the fact that we have to be proud of who we are, who we loves and never give up for anything. Therese could have married a good man and lived a normal life, but she chose love and risk, and finally she was right to do that.
I don't have anything negative to say about this movie, except the fact that it's quite long but it doesn't matter because time goes very fast. I personally think that this movie deserves all the nominations it had and would have deserved prizes. So you really should watch this incredible and beautiful movie, trust me you won't be disappointed!"
" Wonderful Experience !

I really don't like romantic films but I really like the fact that the film Carol talks about homosexuality because we can see in the film that is unacceptable to love someone who has the same gender as you (in 1953) is very a GOOD thing because maybe people can be open minded with this film . But I really don't understand why these actresses need to be naked in my opinion the film Carol would be better if they just play more like a seduction game but obviously it's only my opinion and my point of view but You need to watch this film ! It will be a wonderful experience !

It's crazy how Cate Blanchett and Ronney Mara are playing so well in this movie. They don't need to say a word, they talk with eyes as two lovers do and it's beautiful.

",0.6124,0.9902,2019-07-19 00:00:00,7,"Visually, this is a stunning film. The cinematography, sets, and costume design were clearly well thought out and well executed. As for the acting, in my opinion Cate Blanchett gives a solid and convincing performance; there were moments when I only saw Carol and not the actress. Rooney Mara also gives a good performance, but it did not feel as genuine as Blanchett's. The supporting cast (Sarah Paulson, Kyle Chandler) also did well with the little time they were shown onscreen. In my opinion none of the dialogue felt unconvincing in any scene. I believe the characters would be more likable had they been given slightly more development. It is a good story, but definitely feels like there's something lacking. However, I suppose the subtly of the situations portrayed and how the characters react to them adds an element of realism. Overall, there is no such thing as a perfect film. Carol is solid and well made, but could definitely be improved story-wise."

The casting of Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, was a tour de force, the chemistry between them is unmistakable, and they are well supported, with good performances from Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson. The music by Carter Burwell was sublime as was the direction of Todd Haynes. As the film progressed you were both hopeful but apprehensive that it could fall apart, but as with all things true love did find its way."
" Gorgeously filmed love story
",0.8176,0.9107,2019-05-31 00:00:00,10,"I was blown away by this movie. I'm not often one for romantic movies, but this one is just exceptional. Despite the cold color palette and understated drama, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara have excellent, warm chemistry between one another.A lot of other viewers have complained about the deliberate pacing, but I thought it suited the movie's almost-dreamlike tone. The pacing, themes, and visuals reminded me a lot of Douglas Sirk movies. In fact, he movie is very similar to the director's earlier FAR FROM HEAVEN, a more direct homage to Sirk with its depiction of suffocating suburbia and forbidden love; however, I found CAROL much more involving and less on the nose with its social commentary. I have little doubt this will become a classic in the years to come."

I have to watch the last thirtysomething minutes the next day. I got bored because I couldn't get emotionally involved. And I couldn't get involved cause the lead actresses weren't able to play the real love between the two women. Well, I guess it's hard to play something you have no idea about but the Oscar nominated performances are beyond belief weak actually. My favourite Cate Blanchett appears to be plain creepy and the talented Rooney Mara pretentious and silly. Only the love scene was surprisingly convinsing and really hot. Kudos to the ladies for that ;) But in the end it seems the whole relationship is based on sexual desire only which is... tasteless. Even the music and the praised cinematography weren't really there to save the day. I give one star for the sex scene, the second one for costumes and the third one to the actor who played Carol's husband displaying great range of emotions in the supporting role."

Carol published on 2015, and I would consider one of the best lesbian movies of all time. When I finishes this movie, I had a sense of utopia of the two main character. They choose to use this amazing road trip to explore the love and each other. Just like Brokeback Mountain, when the director to portray love beyond gender, people will truly understand the love between Carol and Therese. When Therese says "" If I never know to say no, how can I understand I truly want."" at the break up scene, she does not know she already turns down to his boyfriend's Europe trip, boyfriend's proposal, and Danny's kiss. The only thing she cannot say no is the feeling about Carol. These background story's time is around 50's, maybe this relationship is impossible for them. However, I think that this movie wants people to aware that this can happen today."

" disappointing
",-0.4939,0.9955,2019-01-03 00:00:00,5,"2 hours. miracles have been made with two hours of time in matter of filmmaking. this, did not. Those 120 minutes we as an audience gifted towards the people involved in this movie, were just wasted. Reminded me of waiting in the line of the bank, or waiting for my food to be served in my table, or waiting in my car trapped in traffic, after a long and tiring day of college. This analogy popped in my mind because, I waited patiently for something to happen, and it never did. We see Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett in a soul-less romance in the 50s.This movie, has so many flaws, firstly: the movie lacks character development. This results in the audience never caring about anyone in the film. We don't know their motives or know their lives or their inner world in a intimate way. This made me almost instantly compare with ""Blue is the warmest color"", a waaaaaay more intense, intimate and raw film about lesbian love. Secondly, poor acting. Cate disappointed me greatly, I used to think about her as a more profound actress, and in here, her performance was so plain, so boring, so superficial. I never knew she was in love with Rooney's character, then boom they had sex and I was like ok, then maybe I guess they're in love? Later we get to see one of the most boring, insincere, poorly acted ""i love you"" in film history. And I'm Mexican, I've seen soap operas with more heart and soul, than this scene. Thirdly, poor script: nothing happens. Never. Their romance pops outta of nowhere, they go into a trip, then they come back and split, and after some time (I never understood how much supposedly the story advanced in this part), they reencounter and start over their romance. Well... it was really badly done.I understand its timed in the 50s, that's why the romance is kinda of ""hidden"" to the plain sight. But this mysteriousness of their love is so great and deep, that maybe it was hidden in the acting! If this was the idea, then the producer, actresses and the director were geniuses. Otherwise, it's a really bad attempt of portraying lesbian love.The only character I believed was Sarah Paulson, she rocks it. Another thing I liked was the cinematography, i think it was beautiful. Almost like a memory, that scene, where we see them driving and watching the landscape. it was really awesome, transported me to ""that"" feeling. Also, those scenes where Rooney's character feels trapped, was flawlessly done. Frames in a frames are always powerful in a scene, and this is not the exception. The music, on the other hand, was touching, but sadly the actresses didn't portrayed the beautiful romance the music wants you to feel and empathize with.So, I give it a 5. Amazing music and camerawork, but boring script, plain acting and poor use of scenes and time to develop a story properly, in a engaging way. But hey! maybe this will help film academy students to learn what they shouldn't do while making a film so, there's always a positive side."
" Still glad I watched it but....
",0.4588,0.9124,2018-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I read the book many years ago so when I found it was being made into a feature I was thrilled to read the leads would be Cate Blancett and Rooney Mara. Both are brilliant in the film.Again as with the book, I thought the plot was spot on and the script was rather a good one. But at times a bit slow and maybe not as intense as it potentially could have been as there was clearly chemistry. And heck I'm gonna say it, not enough rudey time on screen. Why is it whenever lesbian sex is always portrayed on screen its always the same damn thing. There is more to it you know!!! To anyone directing a gay or lesbian feature please get a consultant and show a bit more than five mins of the same stuff you shoot every time :-sOtherwise great movie!"
" Mesmerising

Beautiful.Possibly the best film that I've seen with hardly any real action. It felt like a dream.A very vanilla review, I know. I've just watched this film and I'm feeling very tranquil. The final end scene honestly took my breath away- and with no dialogue! Absolutely sublime filmmaking.Just lovely. I reccommed anyone looking for a film with extraordinary female leads and a gorgeous period plot to watch this film."
" Dynamic Characters
",0.3818,0.9366,2018-12-20 00:00:00,7,"Let me start off by saying, I love how each character develops throughout Carol. Carol really is more like two different stories intertwined. Two women fall in love and then the rest is how it changes their lives. Without spoiling too much, I will say that Carol, herself, is the most disappointing development. Going from the strong lead to this desperate downtrotten woman. I wanted to like this interesting story so much more than I did, but really Carol is just too slow with not enough rising action. The villains are truly terrible and that pushes the story along, but besides that, I felt that a good story missed its opportunity to be great by missing more excitement."

I'll keep this short but you could say so much about this film. I've seen it maybe 15 times and it still has the same effect on me.The cast is stunning and so perfect. Cate Blanchett is obviously iconic and can play any role, but just seems to fit Carol so well. Mara, Paulson and Chandler are also A+. The SOUNDTRACK... breath taking. Carter Burwell has truly done it again. Chuck a few 50s classics in there and you literally can't beat it. Cinematography, set design, costume, script - all amazing. No wonder it took about 100 years to get on to our screens. If you like Sirk or melodrama in general, this will be up your alley.Todd Haynes, you are a bloody genius."
" Charming recreation... and that's it
",0.5859,0.9301,2018-12-09 00:00:00,5,"What a beautiful looking movie! When it's about historic dramas it's very hard to beat the fifties, especially those as well made and with so much passion and elegance put in as this. Not only captures the era, or at least what I have romanticized as it, but it lets it shine with a subtlety that very few productions manage to achieve. Compare this with the over reliance of Elizabeth: The Golden Age's (which casts the same star in the lead role) bombastic scenography, set and costume design and there's no way you don't prefer Carol. Anyway, the director's work is quite pleasant, to say the least; a very contained atmosphere, something I consider appropriate, a good management of space given the circumstances, and a slow yet enchanting progression through the story. The bad thing is the writing, which is poor most of the time and barely mediocre on its high points. Almost at the end there's some kind of monologue which arguably tried to be touching and heart-breaking but it's just meh, and that's something that defines the whole experience. Tough luck to the director, I guess, even with the performance of his actors and actresses, especially Cate Blanchett, to whom I didn't believe a single minute. Rooney Mara's decent enough, and the rest are ok, but ultimately irrelevant. Anyway I would recommend this film to everybody who likes urban post-war American ambience, just don't set the bar to high."

" Incredibly Acted & Poetically Shot
",0.0,0.9915,2018-10-04 00:00:00,9,"(Flash Review)Taking place in the 50s, this is a picturesque and poetic romantic tale about an unconventional love for the era. An older and sophisticated woman is drawn to a younger shop clerk. Both from different backgrounds and classes, an attraction is lit. There is a slow and subtle build to their emotions artistically presented by their expressions, gestures, innuendo and careful shot framing. There is also a dominant vs naivety dynamic that is a key for the two getting to know each other. As they deal with various hurdles in their lives, they do their best to tune out the world around them. How will emotions and society steer their romance or crush it? Structurally and artistically, this is how films should take advantage of the medium of film! Textural shots are peppered in while complimented by great period music, styles, colors and dÃ©cor help to tell the story. Blanchett and Mara completely become the characters and ace the emotions from subtle to boisterous perfectly."

" Good but perhaps over-rated
",0.2382,0.9879,2018-07-24 00:00:00,7,"New York City, 1952: Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) is a wealthy, middle-aged woman in the process of divorcing her husband who is resisting her divorce. While Christmas shopping for her young daughter, she shares a mutual attraction with Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a young store clerk who aspires to be a photographer.""Carol"" has the right production values (cinematography, set design, music, and costumes) that help director Todd Haynes recreate a time period long gone. The journey is beautiful in a mysterious way.Blanchett is as great as always. She is as suave as suave could possibly get and she can show the inner conflict of someone whose new relationship could jeopardize having equal custody to her daughter once the divorce proceedings begin.Mara, in a subtle way, conveys the innocence of a young woman coming of age in a very unusual way. I have no doubt of her talents but she was difficult to read at times; she could show depth but sometimes seemed too restrained, rarely changing her facial expression. It's hard to tell if this was the choice of Mara, Haynes, or both.For much of the film, it seemed like the main characters were going through the motions but there could have been more chemistry between them even though repression and conformity were 1950s hallmarks. (An aside: it seems this is the season for movies taking place in New York in the 1950s. ""Brooklyn"" and ""Bridge of Spies"" are two other examples.) Clearly, the benchmark for forbidden same-sex love stories is ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005). In that film, there was more evidence of tension building between the two lovers. The separation anxiety was also more evident including the excitement of reuniting. This is not to say that ""Carol"" must be similar but it could have used less restraint.It is in the last half-hour that the movie really shines. Blanchett is superb in a scene involving her husband and their lawyers. And later, the film finishes at just the right point leaving only a tiny bit of ambiguity. It left so much subtle emotion that I only wish the rest of the film had been as strong."
" A deeply intimate experience
",0.0,0.8992,2018-07-03 00:00:00,10,"Carol set out to bring the audience right into the relationship of the two main characters (Carol & Therese) and executed its concept perfectly. The movie does not worry too much about plot or manufacturing suspense, but rather allows the relationship between Carol and Therese to take center stage. This intense focus on character/relationship development while just letting the story progress naturally in the backseat results in a deeply intimate, almost beautiful experience for the audience, something I feel has been missing from the mainstream film industry for a while."
" Beautiful film about two queer women falling in love in the 1950's
",0.8176,0.9901,2018-06-26 00:00:00,9,"This is my favorite queer romance movie. The acting was amazing; I love both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. They both were able to portray their characters in such a raw, authentic, beautiful way. You could tell that they both understood the story and their characters. The relationship between the two women was so tender and honest. Even though it is a story about two women falling in love, I do not think you need to be queer to like this movie.
 I also appreciated how subtle the film is. There is so much meaning in just a look or a touch. I thought it was even more meaningful than there being tons of dialogue because at that time there wasn't as much language around being LGBTQ+ like there is now. It made the dialogue all the more meaningful when they did speak. It really did feel like this movie could have been shot in the 1950's. I loved the cinematography and that they shot on real film. It really adds to the beauty and artistic nature of the film. I admire that how they filmed it made it so that you could see both of the characters points of view. I think this was very important so that you connect to both of the characters. In the novel by Patricia Highsmith called, A Price of Salt, it's all from Therese's point of view. Carol ends up being more of an object that Therese is infatuated with, rather than a real person. I enjoyed that they changed that; I think it makes the relationship and characters more authentic. I also loved that it ended on an optimistic note and that none of the queer characters were killed or portrayed as crazy. I would say that it's definitely a movie that you kind of have to understand how women and LGBTQ+ people were treated in the 1950's, otherwise you may not understand the characters or the story as deeply. It's also not a film for people who don't like subtly or who need a fast pace, action movie. This is not going to be that. I could say a lot about this film, but I think you should just give it a try. I'd certainly recommend it. You can watch it on Netflix or rent/buy it on Amazon."
" 50s American charm
",0.4019,0.9914,2018-05-18 00:00:00,7,"The production design on this is beautiful. Even in its less glamorous scenes, it oozes 50s American charm. It's a fake world and a perfect setting for this story, an exercise in social control bristling with tense expectation and makes for a perfect setting for this love story. It's almost dreamlike, both Blanchett and Mara effortlessly floating from scene to scene. Mara, innocent, playful. Blanchett, cold, mysterious. Dialogue delivered calmly, the camera allowed to linger and drift. Music poignant, haunting. It's not all plain sailing of course, far from it, but the ups and downs are timed perfectly, the editor (Affonso GonÃ§alves) doing his work perfectly. In fact the pacing of the whole thing is pretty amazing. It's very much a film of twos. Two people, two worlds, light and dark. Fantastic!"
" Brilliant performance by Cate and Rooney
",0.5859,0.9684,2018-04-27 00:00:00,5,"It is easy to understand why Cate and Rooney were nominated for the Oscars while the movie wasn't for Best Picture. The actors have done a wonderful job of portraying their respective characters. Cate as the older, unhappy woman who is always impeccably dressed and appears nonchalant but on a closer look reveals a frightened, confused woman with low self esteem. Carol constantly sets her hair and face, worried she's not looking good enough. Rooney is the wistful, innocent little shop assistant who is clearly infatuated with Carol and her rich lifestyle but at the same time is not needy or parasitic. Carol describes Therese as a strange girl, flung out of space. The movie was also nominated for cinematography and deservedly so. The story is set in the 50s when homosexuality was still a taboo and looked down upon. The film is very subtle in its references and there is no garish display of feelings between the characters. The film has also captured the emotions and the feeling of resignation/helplessness that a woman in Carol's shoes would have felt during that period. When Carol is not allowed to meet her daughter, she decides to go on a road trip by simply stating ""what else am I going to do?"" Carol needs the certificate of a psychotherapist to be deemed a mother capable of bringing up her daughter. (We can let out a sigh of relief that that this was in the 50s, we have made much progress since then OR have we?)I love observing the background and the objects in films that are set in different eras. I particularly remember the ancient looking door handle of the fridge. The filmmakers have paid great attention to detail.The film focuses on the most conflicted question we face in our lives - to follow ones heart or mind? I got a bit bored halfway through because I do not like films that have melancholia lurking in the background. The movie is a bit slow to my liking and this is not my favourite movie of Cate Blanchett."

And it shows that carol was attracted to her when she started asking her personal questions. Like ""what did you want when you were 4?"" And it seems like no one asks Therese these kind of questions judging by the way her eyes refused to meet carol's. Carol was eyeing Therese every moment she could get just to savior her, or rather, the moment. And she wanted to see her more. So I think she left her gloves there on purpose just as an excuse to see her again. When they went out for lunch, their chemistry is so well after only a few minutes of conversation, Carol was so willing to know about Therese. you could tell that carol was kind of suspicious of Therese's sexuality when she said that she was a. ""Very strange girl"". And that she was ""out of this world"". After that, they show a scene where Therese writes Carols name and when she first met her. I think that means that she likes would like to remember her.that moment where she went to the Times office with her friend, and when they were talking about attractions, I think that opened her mind a bit. You can't help but think that they've shared a pretty special moment in the car, and Therese would probably think that she REALLY wants to capture carol, not just her beauty, but her kindness, along the fact that she's the first person she ever takes a picture of, she's that special to her already . And when they're back home, she can't help but think that she's also a good mother. When Therese's playing the piano and carol comes and just puts her hands on her shoulder, She becomes a little tense, it's either she's realizing her attraction or no one has touched her that gently before. She gets flustered whenever carol asks her personal questions.She witnesses the fight that happens outside between harge and carol and she just highers the volume, respecting their privacy.When she's taking Therese back to the station in the car, you can see how miserable carol looks. And how helpless Therese feels, therefore she cries in the train because she just feels like it's her fault, that she wants to make carol feel better and all."
" Beautiful and wonderful

In essence this is a mesmerising and deeply touching story of two people who are inexplicably drawn to each other despite the numerous social and circumstantial barriers standing in their way. Beautifully put together, amazing attention to period detail and a musical score that underlines and accentuates the characters' emotions. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are incredible - their performances subtle yet so powerful and the chemistry between them is palpable, so much passing between them in just stillness and a look, that you ache for them both in different ways. Hand on heart this is one of the best films I've seen, not least because it reminded me of what it felt like to fall deeply in love with someone for the first time. I've seen this film 6 times in 10 days and I will return to it again and again. Brilliant."

" Beautiful, heartwarming
",0.7906,0.991,2018-01-30 00:00:00,8,"I recently watched this movie, and I really liked it! Essentially, the movie explores the romantic relationship that develops between a department store clerk (Therese) and an older elegant woman (Carol). As homosexuality was not widely accepted during the time period of the story, the 1950s, their relationship is kept hidden and is faced with many obstacles.The movie's timing is relatively slow, but that actually enhanced the story line in my opinion; it made the relationship between Therese and Carol flourish at a more natural and realistic pace. I also thoroughly appreciated the beautiful scenery seen throughout the film. The costumes and overall setting designs were phenomenal and definitely reflective of the time period. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, the two leading actresses, both did a superb job at portraying their characters; their passion was extremely evident, and they really embodied their characters in an honest and believable way.I think my only point of contention is with the movie's ending. I personally felt that it was a bit rushed, which somewhat undermines the slow pacing that pervades the rest of the movie. I was left wanting to know more about what happened with their relationship and with the custody battle for Rindy. Nevertheless, the movie did not disappoint, and I highly recommend it!"

From the first scene in the department store where Therese worked, I viewed Carol's interest as repulsively predatory and it would have been if the part of Carol was played by a middle aged man.Down to the ""erotic"" scene in the hotel, which again was lifeless and uninspiring and well, boring, the whole film had a coldness to it, down to the limp dry hair of the main characters: wigs, I would guess.Carol never comes across as a concerned mother, yes she grabs and hugs her kid a lot but does not engage in any meaningful way with her.The cinematography was well done, the 50s scenes for the most part believable.But for a film about passion and undying love, no, this didn't work for me.3 out of 10."

I don't see any real love between the two women in this story. Lust may be!Passion? If one decided to leave your husband and family for the truth love, one should have the gust and passion to go for it. But when the wife got the telegram she was already behaving like a chicken. When the other woman wanted to have a true love from an affair with a married woman, why could she have just honestly confessed to her boyfriend instead of blaming him annoying her. Nothing has this affair shown or told something beautiful.Chemistry? The casting is not good. I don't know whether the two actress are lesbians, straight or bisexual, there are simply no chemistry between the two. The love scene has shown not much passion too.Five stars is already far too much for this movie. I would rather prefer via youtube to watch those web BL movies like Uncontrolled Love, The Third World, Lost Love, History - My Hero, and Red Balloon etc. They are low budget productions for web sending but brings and shows much more love and passion!"

" Gray on Brown
",0.0,0.9944,2017-12-28 00:00:00,3,"At its root, Carol is just another Hollywood sacrifice laid at the altar of marital infidelity. It's one of the few films other than Notes on a Scandal (another Blanchet project) that dares to show the predatory nature of lesbians. Despite the low review score I accord Carol, I recommend that it be watched on Netflix solely because of the beauty of the art direction and photography. I'm a sucker for movies set in the first half of the 1950s and I loved the time travel feeling I got while watching this. But . . . let's see. Carol targets Therese (pronounced tuh-REZE don't you know) while Christmas shopping in a NYC department store. For her daughter, Carol buys a model train set upon Therese's suggestion. Apparently a pretty young woman suggesting a masculine gift for a little girl was a gender bender signal in NYC in late 1952. Carol intentionally leaves her exquisite leather gloves on the counter when she leaves. Therese mails them back to her then follows up with a phone call. The tone of the call is the same as the tone of their first conversation in the department store and is the same as every other conversation they will have in the movie; dull as gray on brown. Not a hint of excitement or pleasure in either woman's voice. They meet again and Carol invites Therese out for Christmas. Enter Harge, Carol's cuckolder husband who instantly sniffs out the nature of the women's relationship. Harge is drunk and belligerent but he professes love for Carol and a desire to be together. Harge leaves with the daughter for Christmas in Florida. Things plod along. We see Therese taking some pictures, declining an advance by a nice fellow who works for the Times, and acting pretty disinterested in a guy who I think was her pre-Carol romantic interest. Next we have ""Carole and Therese's Boring Road Trip"" where they meet a geeky guy who is a travelling salesman of notions, although he tells them he doesn't know what notions are. That night things get hot and Therese tells Carol in a monotone ""take me to bed."" 
We then have a scene of perfunctory semi nudity (the wannabe star shows more skin than the star has to show). They fall asleep in each other's arms. More gray on brown. The ONLY emotion shown in the flick occurs the next morning when Carole finds out the notions salesman was a private eye who rented the room next to them and tape recorded the gray on brown lovemaking. Carol is distraught and leaves for New York and her friend (and former lover) Abby comes to drive Therese home. Fast forward to the pre-divorce attorney and client conference where Carol is 
pretty quick to give custody to Harge so long as she has visitation rights. Carol and Therese later meet for a drink and Therese declines an invitation to go to a fancy restaurant where Carol is meeting friends. After accepting a friend's invitation to a party, Therese later goes to the crowded restaurant and spots Carol at a table full of people. Therese ... walks ... slowly ... toward ... Carol ... until ... Carol ... sees ... her. Their gazes lock in what appears to be a freeze frame. The end. At last. Now, I've been in love, though never in a same sex relationship. And I've fallen hard, and I've been infatuated. But never have I been as emotionless about it all as these 2 were. I get that this was 1952 and that lesbians had to hide in plain site (like those 2 stereotypes in the record store) and I didn't expect them to be holding hands while walking down 5th Avenue. But . . . when they were alone, still gray on brown? Never a laugh, a smile, a joke, a wink, a giggle ... nothing. Just a lifeless reading of the script. The acting in this was pretty darn lousy if you ask me. Maybe they were just following the book but this doesn't show any character, much less character development. Maybe it was just a book that didn't need to be made into a movie. With the exceptions of the little girl and some of Therese's friends, everyone in this movie is bored to the point of self-destruction. It's Christmas in New York but where is the joy? It's as if a giant Hoover vacuum was used to suck the life out of New York. I'm giving it a 3 because I'm a nice person."
" Quietly mesmerising
",0.0,0.9839,2017-12-22 00:00:00,9,"Todd Haynes' 'Carol', like much of his output, paints a inch-perfect picture of life as it was the 1950s, at least for the middle and upper-middle classes, the sort of protrayal that emphasises the idea that the past is another country and they do things differently there. My gut reaction is to dislike this approach, to feel that a focus on aesthetic differences or behavioural norms hides the essential truth that underneath, we're the same as we always have been. But I can't help but praise 'Carol', a quietly mesmerising movie about two women who have a very socially-unacceptable affair. The acting is good, the score is excellent, but what's really brilliant is that the film works as a portrait of individuals, motivated by their own mixtures of desire and need. This is less a story about the right to be gay, per se, as one about the more general right just to be yourself; but it doesn't shy away from presenting the innate selfishness of asserting that right. I particularly liked the way Cate Blanchett's eponymous character, older and glamourous, initially appears to be calling all the shots, but in fact it's her mousy companion who turns out to have the firmer idea of what she really wants. A subtle and excellent movie."

Boy, did I do myself a favor!The soundtrack and cinematography are simply the best and has forced me to purchase the soundtrack because it is so strikingly lovely. Maybe the film being a period piece lends itself to the orchestral maneuvers that Carter Burwell uses to elicit that certain physiological response that makes your body want to move ( if you know what I mean). Marry the preceding with an intriguing storyline about an older woman seducing a younger woman (or was it visa versa) that was believable (maybe a wee bit camped-up by Blanchet during the first 15 or so minutes) and Mara's pain from being dumped, once, twice.Did I say, I love happy endings.I would like to see a sequel."

The colors, the textures, clothing, everything is excellent, depicting this golden era of New York Times and urban life in New York. I also liked the ending.

" Looks and Stares
",0.0,0.9854,2017-12-03 00:00:00,8,"Romance blossoms between a wealthy, middle aged woman and an open-minded younger woman in this lusciously filmed drama set during the 1950s. While both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are effective in their respective roles, the most interesting aspect of 'Carol' is the near ignorance of everyone else to the possibility of the pair being in love. More than half an hour passes before Blanchett's husband questions how Mara knows her and director Todd Haynes does wonders keeping the mutual attraction between the pair subtle. Much is communicated simply through looks and stares without the need for explicit romantic moments or obvious dialogue. This subdued approach in turns makes Blanchett's more emotional moments in the second half of the film more powerful as she comes against a ""morality clause"" in her impending divorce proceedings. Certain aspects of both female protagonists are left uncomfortably murky - most notably, the suggestion that Blanchett might have a history of seducing younger women. Both characters are generally well fleshed out though as they are torn between the hearts' desires and being what everyone else expects them to be. Carter Burwell provides an enchanting music score that perfectly complements the proceedings and the memorable final scene is a testament to the ability of images to convey more than words."
" The wonderful Cate Blanchet under-appreciated

Both are fine but not stunning. Cinematography is very good, costume design is excellent. But the story becomes childish, totally linear and unimaginative.

If Carol was suppose to be a manipulative wealthy woman who has had several affairs and gets what she wants then Cate Blanchett was perfect for the role. However, is she was to be seen as truly in love with the younger shop assistant and we are to have sympathy for her during that time period and that she would have to give a lot away to be with her then Cate Blanchett did not convince. I did enjoy the quietness of the film. There would be many people who probably thought it was too slow for them and possibly boring."

The production value is refreshing for this kind of movie which is usually reserved for more traditional love stories not those between two women in different stages of their life both forced to chose between security and passion. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are of course spectacular. Sarah Paulson plays supporting but important roll. Kyle Chandler who played Cate Blanchett's on screen husband could have been written as a villain but instead he is written as a confused and bitter man lashing out at a woman who never loved him. And for fans of ""Gotham"" there is Cory Michael Smith who plays a small but pivotal roll. This is not an action movie by any definition of the word. It is slow and precise in its storytelling. However in doing that it is able to tell a beautiful and touching story about two women in love in a time where that kind of love could cost you everything."
" Beautiful, but boring.
",-0.128,0.4932,2017-09-25 00:00:00,5,"This was a beautiful story with beautiful music and beautiful costumes and beautiful cinematography, but it was a total snooze fest. The whole movie I felt myself either uncomfortable with the awkwardness of Rooney Maras character or totally bored out of my mind. While this film was filled with emotion, I felt there wasn't a lot to it. The film just dragged on with Carol dragging Therese across the country. There were points in this film where I was literally falling asleep. The film is beautiful- there is no question about it. But I wouldn't recommend unless you are ready for a long nap."

Therese is temporarily working in a gift shop, where she meets Carol. Their first glance makes it something special in them. Their friendship grows. Then they decide to make a trip, that changes their life.6 Oscar Nominations, the are well deserved. The movie was safe in the hands of the Director. Cinematography is amazing. Costume design really supports the visual beauty. Set design is another important ingredient of the visual beauty.Rooney Mara was the main reason for me to watch the movie. She didn't disappoint me. She did an amazing job along with Cate Blanchett. Both they were nominated for the Oscars.If you really love films, this is a must watch. Do not miss this beautiful Carol.#KiduMovie"
" Exploitative Love
",0.6369,0.9871,2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"Carol is an extraordinary Lesbian love story between Carol and Therese set in America of 1950s. The film is titled ""Carol"" and not ""Carol and Therese"" because Carol dominates. She schemes to hook the wide-eyed Therese, manipulates her and always manages to get her way. Their first encounter in the toy section of a department store sizzles with subtexts. Carol is shopping for a Christmas present for her 4-year old daughter and asks Therese, the store girl, to recommend a suitable doll. Therese prefers a train-set and the die is cast! She conveniently leaves behind her gloves on the counter so that Therese can reach out to her. Carol's marriage is unhappy, primarily because of her sexual orientation. She has another closet lover, an intriguing woman named Abby (played by a pokerfaced Sarah Paulson) who narrates one of their physical encounters to Therese and unhelpfully concludes - ""nobody knows why these things happen"". Therese, played with great panache by Rooney Mara, is a foreigner, naÃ¯ve, vulnerable, who can't ever say ""No"". Initially confused by Carol's advances, she decides to play along, unsure and confused about her own sexuality. As the film progresses, we see her personality evolving along with her photography skills. Another metaphor worth savouring, if you please. Are we watching the film from Therese's POV?The film is lavishly shot and panders to our senses. The two women enjoy the fabric and furniture in opulent hotel rooms, dab each other with perfumes and clink martini glasses. Soft focus, muted colours, soothing voices, all in sync with the subject matter of the film, lend it a gorgeous look. The film is set in cold Christmas week and the riot of warm colours is an interesting counterpoint. Director Todd Haynes, uses a circular narration and establishes the period of the film through TV images of Dwight Eisenhower, lovingly shot Buicks and Teddy Wilson's vinyls. The film is punctuated with ring tones â train whistles, phone rings, bells, elevator alarms â jarring realities in a lyrical ballad. The toast to President McKinley is a wicked reference that will take some working out. In a film bristling with Lesbian love, all such references are coded, in keeping with the times. Deciphering these codes may require a second viewing and is an obvious delight. But ultimately Carol belongs to Cate Blanchett, who literally lives the part. Most times, she lets her eyes speak. Eyes that brilliantly convey the physical yearning. Eyes that manage to seduce not only Therese, but us viewers. She manages to make us love her despite her blatant exploitation of Therese. My final thought as I left the film: Carol exploits an ambivalent woman much like a man would do to a woman. She has her reasons, but is it justified? Is exploitation a learned behaviour?"
" what a disappointment
",-0.5106,0.9591,2017-08-15 00:00:00,3,"I gave it a 3 only because of Cate's performance - stunning as ever. However the script is as exciting as damp melba toast, as enthralling as a 3 day old cup of coffee and simply quite dull. Patricia Highsmith is a grand writer of a certain genre and era. Set this film against The Talented Mr. Ripley and you can see how bad the script is, how bad the director is and few if any directors male and female know how to direct an intimate film of love - love between two women especially. When we compare this film to The Hours - well there is no comparison. Or compare it to the German film, Aimee and Jaguar based on a true story set during the Holocaust - well again there is no comparison.All this money and talent that gets us nowhere. So they kiss - wow - big deal and they sleep together, or have sex or make love or whatever you want to call it - wow - that will get the reviewers attention and the audience in the theatre.but where is the love, where is the drama, where is the reason they like each other, are attracted to each other - what brings them together, rips them apart, etc etc etc - the emotional level of this film is about as intense as Johnny English (a comedy by the way).....The colorization, the cinematography the music are all good, and even exciting at some points, but really - what a disappointment. too bad - so much possibility with such a wealth of talent - how many people work on a film and the film to be a dud - let's be honest - that is what it is.....PS did they do this on purpose by directing the men in the film to be as bad as high school actors? I don't understand why it has such high ratings - but then again, it's up against comic book and cartoon character driven films for box office receipts only."

" The curse and blessing of being passive observers...
",0.128,0.9996,2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"""Carol"" is one of the most puzzling romances I saw recentlyÂ but it's not much a flaw as an insightful reflection of a time where even the proudest representative of the free world couldn't grant its citizens the freedom to express their love, to discover who they are, let alone to experiment it. The film is set in New York City circa Christmas 1952 and while American audiences will probably appreciate the progresses made for human rights, viewers from less tolerant countries will find a powerful parallel between the central relationship and their own struggles.Now, the semantic trap would be to label this very relationship a 'lesbian romance', yes the two women played by Carol Blanchett and Rooney Mara are lesbians but this is not a traditional love story, it's more of a growing friendship culminating with love, a strange attraction that isn't explicitly stated as love or even lust when the eyes of Carol Aird, a glamorous blonde woman in her mid-thirties, meet the shy Therese Belivet, a department store vendor. The two women exchange a few banalities we try to decode, but thankfully, the screenplay written by Phyllis Nagy avoids the obviousness. Therese used to love train sets, but this is less to assert a masculine side than a gift for peculiarity, even her hobbies like photography, if not odd, aren't the most common for a woman in the early 50's.But from their first dialogue, we also gather the information that Carol is a mother, with a little girl, and just when they have nothing else to say, the conversation resumes as if the two women would have wished to make it longer. By the time they meet again in a restaurant, we discover that Carol is divorcing from her husband Harge, a neglectful, domineering but ambiguously loving husband played by Kyle Chandler, and that Therese has a boyfriend who want to marry her. These two women have conventional lifestyles but these are obvious fronts to hide two penchants, one Carol clearly asserted, but Therese is still exploring.And is is very interesting that Therese is a photographer; all through the movie, she's like embodying this hobby by being a passive observer, never opposing any resistance, always available for Carol for any date, at any time. The first encounters aren't passionate enough to pass as love but you can tell Carol is offering little parcels to reach her soul, some bridges of communication Therese never miss. The mutuality of their attraction is so obvious that Carol sees in Therese an angel fallen from the sky, literally too good to be true. The film has the simple maturity of a classic like ""Brief Encounter"" where the text matters less than the subtext and you can literally witness the blossoming of love.Nagy's screenplay is all in finesse and echoes a comment made about the movie ""Sunset Blvd."" the need to see the real message behind the words. I haven't read the original romance ""The Price of Salt"" from Patricia Higsmith (the author of ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", more accustomed to the thriller genre) but I can feel that director Todd Haynes really translated the growing complicity in such a way that the body language, the way the two women interact with their eyes, with their tone, cold for Carol, shy for Therese, says more about the forbidden aspect of their love than any explicit contextualization. The innuendos aren't seductive but defensive.The film is set in a time light-years ahead of our Internet and cell-phone driven time where everything is taken for granted. It's these very obstacles that made the relationship grow slowly and patiently, creating an interesting contrast with Golden Palm winner ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" where the two women could get sexual immediately. In ""Carol"", the sex scene is the culmination and it is long enough to celebrate their love and short enough to escape from voyeurism. It is also dramatic as they lowered their guard and proved the husband ""right"" since he raised a clause of morality to get full custody of their daughter, exploiting Carol's relationship with Therese and their daughter's godmother Abby (Sarah Paulson).But the film has a way to deal with the issue without it being a catechism session about human rights; the way Carol deals with her relationship and her divorce shows a level of maturity, lucidity and dignity rarely displayed in a film. ""Carol"" doesn't try to go as far as the plot can take it, on the contrary, it is a sweet and simply told story about a very complex relationship. Anyone can empathize with Carol and Therese and even men aren't portrayed like savage bigots, it's a credit to Todd Haynes to have adopted a neutral point, trusting the maturity of his material and the performances of his actors. Blanchett plays Carol with a dignified authority while Rooney Mara looks genuinely hypnotized by this woman, until we can see some maturity gleaming in her eyes.I was pleasantly surprised by how sober and fluid the film was, featuring an impossible love story in the same vein of intelligence as Brokeback Mountain, and again, calling it a 'lesbian romance' is missing the point, this is a story of forbidden love, heart-warming, touching and with the kind of inspirational ending that severely lack in today's cinema."
" A gorgeous, subtle and beautifully crafted film!
",0.8398,0.993,2017-07-06 00:00:00,9,"The first thought that comes to mind after watching Carol is; ""Absolutely beautifully well crafted"". Carol is a gorgeous, subtly ground-breaking and an exquisite work of art rippling with mid-century melancholy. The film is a smorgasbord of edible fifties design, and finds meaning in the smallest of details. Cate Blanchett plays Carol,a struggling woman in the middle of a divorce, who falls in love with a young department store assistant; Therese, played by Rooney Mara. Therese is selling Carol a toy train as a Christmas present for her daughter. It's large so it must be delivered; and accidentally on purpose; Carol leaves her gloves behind on the counter. Before too long, Therese is invited to Carol's lavish home upstate, but her desperate husband (Kyle Chandler) turns up uninvited, and the Airds argue bitterly in the driveway. The acting throughout the film is superb. Cate Blanchett navigates the character of Carol Aird with a subtlety that is little short of phenomenal. Her hauteur and elegance matched with fear and self-doubt is utterly right, as we see Blanchett continually touching her face and stroking her hair as she speaks to Therese: a ""poker tell"" of desire. Roony Mara's Therese Belivet has something alien and blank about her, like a photo sheet not yet set in developing fluid. She is doe-eyed and callow, submissive yet watchful. Mara's rigidity as an actress is completely ideal in conveying this, in the sullen set she gives Therese's lips, the way she hunches in corners and seems scared and perplexed by every new feeling. The great Sarah Paulson gives a smart supporting performance as Carol's easy-going confidante and former lover Abby. And Kyle Chandler is superb as her furious left-behind-husband Harge. Carol is beautifully shot, and many of the most stunning sequences are inside cars, when they're alone, up close as they flirt, finding a symphony of reflections and hues bouncing off windscreens, thrilling to their potential together. The film shows us the restraint, subtlety and mystery with which gay people in the 1950s could manage their lives with dignity. But it also shows the depression and self-control into which Carol has had to retreat and from which she is now defiantly emerging. Blanchett has a scene trying to reason with Chandler's Harge in front of their lawyers, which lays bare the dismay of their lives so honestly it leaves you breathless. Once we've come towards the end of the film, and hear Carol's next act of pleading, it's cut short after the three most powerful words in the English language, delivered by an actress who couldn't possibly say them with more meaning. And that scene, like the film, is absolutely stunning!"
" A Masterpiece of Eroticism
",0.6249,0.9967,2017-07-04 00:00:00,10,"America in the fifties. Two women accidentally meet. Therese Belivet is a shy shop assistant dreaming of becoming a photographer. Carol Aird, the mother of a girl named Rindy, is about to get divorced. The two dissimilar women fall in love with each other. Slowly they're drawing closer and closer together, which might be damaging to Carol's child custody. But is Carol to give up her true love just because the people around her think she's crazy or even sick?The movie ""Carol"" is based on the novel ""The Price of Salt"", published by Patricia Highsmith in 1952. It was the first serious book depicting a lesbian couple without being sleazy or scandalizing â an arresting read full of suspense and deep emotion. Amazingly, Todd Haynes' adaption from 2015 does it justice in every single way. ""Carol"" is a masterpiece of eroticism: subtle, wistful and restless. To some people, this movie might look painfully slow and cheesy. But let me tell you: It isn't. The eagerness of ""Carol"" is tender, vulnerable even. You have to get into that. But if you do, my God is it great. The two leading actresses are both stunning. Cate Blanchett is perfect as the aloof, yet broken gentlewoman Carol. But the real revelation here is Rooney Mara as Therese. Rarely have I seen such breathtaking performance. Rooney masters every nuance of the femme fragile: she's reticent, sad, unsteady and endlessly yearning. Cate and Rooney have a great chemistry, too. The way they connect with each other through the smallest gestures and glances is exquisite.Haynes' very noirish and noble staging does a great job at expanding all these details. Every word and touch becomes a gentle promise of what's to come. ""Carol"" is a very physical, sensual movie. It's not just about love. It's about sex as well. The script delays the convergence of the two protagonists as long as possible, until the tension is almost unbearable. That is what eroticism is all about: hesitation and frustration. The script also resists the temptation to make the love story preachy. Carol and Therese are treated as humans, not as women. Their dilemma is mostly personal, not political.""Carol"" is a great flick: It's filled with delicate hints, honest tragedy and suspenseful eroticism. One of the best romantic movies I've ever seen."
" Not Engaging
",-0.2584,0.4358,2017-06-03 00:00:00,5,"I watched this movie because I like Kyle Chandler. Unhappily, his part was secondary. The slow story depicts a wealthy married woman who is fascinated by and attracted to women, but the characters never really make an emotional connection with the audience. Carol (Cate Blanchett) smokes a lot, Therese (Rooney Mara) mostly stares, and Harge (Kyle Chandler) mostly swears. It's not a satisfying movie. One viewing was enough for me."

Overall, the film does an amazing job of showing character development.Outstanding, intelligent acting by both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. Blanchett clearly shows the character's sophistication and flirtatiousness through her body posture and verbal delivery. Mara's acting is a great portrayal of a nervous but excited mix of emotions. Her hand gestures and motions are filmed brilliantly, and she does an amazing job of showing the absentminded, unconscious behaviors of an emotional person.Director Todd Haynes especially likes shots through car windows and mirrors to show the viewer the characters' sense of being lost in thought and self reflection.The Super 16 mm film is noteworthy and gives the movie a different texture that corresponds to the 1940s/1950s time period, as does the costume design.Symbols worth noting are cigarettes, mirrors, photographs, and hands. Cigarettes show the character's anxiousness, frustration, as well as flirtation. Mirrors show self reflection and thought. Photographs help the characters to slowly grasp their emotions as they develop, and hands show the delicateness and gentleness of love."

Carol and Therese have an instant attraction but need to carry out their affair discreetly especially as her divorce gets messy and the ongoing custody battle even messier.The film is small scale and beautiful to look at but it really did not amount to much, unfolding slowly and not even too melodramatic.The film makes a point of how badly women were treated at the time for deviating from what was regarded as normal. Carol is at risk of losing custody of her daughter due to her immoral behaviour which shapes how her relationship with Therese develops."
" Fabulous performances by Blanchett and Mara
",0.5267,0.9917,2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"Carol (2015) starring Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, and Sarah Paulson really is all about the established cast and their wonderful performances. Cate Blanchett, one of my favorite actresses, really shows what she can do in this 1950s story about a lesbian relationship. Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman who is the mother of a young girl and is going through a divorce with her soon to be ex husband Harge Aird. Rooney Mara plays Therese Belivet, a young aspiring photographer in her 20s. They meet at a department store where Therese works and Carol is buying a Christmas gift for her daughter. The two of them sense an attraction almost instantly and a close bond starts to form between them. Soon that bond turns romantic and because of the society they live in, they both face harsh consequences. Like I've stated, the acting is marvelous, and the writing is good too. The script gives great depth to the all the characters. It digs deep into Carol and Therese's relationship. I love that about the movie because we as the audience must see all of who these characters are and be able to feel for them and understand the garbage that the society in the 1950s drug them through. The imagery used in the film is breathtaking throughout. I adored the cinematography and the costume design. They all deserved major award nominations if not wins, and the academy did award Carol 6 nominations. I give Carol an 8/10 and suggest it to any and all."
" The Love That Speaks It's Name... Carol
",0.6369,0.9858,2017-03-28 00:00:00,6,"A 50's-set lesbian romance is hardly a revolutionary idea these days. But it goes with the tradition of Todd Haynes who works specifically on LGBTQ stories. But what's more about Carol? Why it's the costumes, the lighting, the cinematography, the luscious beautiful acting by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. No wonder the critics swooned, but I'm not that easily impressed. I need to feel moved. I need to know what the love between these two feels like. Forbidden, passionate love. In this film... some times, I felt it, and some times I didn't. Todd Haynes is really trying here. It's a beautiful effort, but it didn't always work for me. I hope it grows on me someday. Maybe it will. There are great little sequences here. Blanchett and Mara are also a red-hot screen couple."

I could not think of any actress who would fit for the role. I watch the movie and then, re-read the book. It makes perfect sense to me as why Therese fell in love with Carol although there is a huge age gap."
" Reprinted from my blog (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)
",0.0,0.9898,2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"With her Mamie Eisenhower bangs and heart-shaped face, Rooney Mara in Carol becomes the reincarnation of such '50s icons as Audrey Hepburn, Jean Simmons, and Maggie McNamara -- particularly the McNamara of The Moon Is Blue (Otto Preminger, 1953), that once- scandalous play and movie about a young woman who defies convention by talking openly about sex while retaining her virginity. It's just coincidence that Carol is set at the end of 1952 and into 1953, the year of the release of The Moon Is Blue, but the juxtaposition of McNamara's Patty O'Neill and Mara's Therese Belivet seems to me appropriate because the 1950s have become such a touchstone for examining our attitudes toward sex. Director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, adapting a novel by Patricia Highsmith, have done an exemplary job in Carol of not tilting the emphasis toward Grease-style caricature or Mad Men-style satire of the era, or exploiting the same-sex relationship in the film for sensationalism or statement-making. Carol is a story about people in relationships, clear-sightedly viewed in a way that Therese herself would endorse. After asking her boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy) if he's ever been in love with a boy and receiving a shocked reply that he's only ""heard of people like that,"" Therese replies, ""I don't mean people like that. I just mean two people who fall in love with each other."" It's this matter-of-factness that the film tries to maintain throughout its story of Therese and Carol (Cate Blanchett), the well-to-do wife in a failing marriage. That the film is set in the 1950s, when cracks were showing in the conventional attitudes toward both marriage and homosexuality, gives piquancy to their relationship, but it doesn't limit it. The story could be (and probably is) playing itself out today in various combinations of sexual identity. The film works in large part because of the steadiness of Haynes at the helm, with two extraordinary actresses at the center and beautiful support from Sarah Paulson as Abby, Carol's ex-lover, and Kyle Chandler (one of those largely unsung actors like the late Bill Paxton who make almost everything they appear in better) as Carol's husband, the hard-edged Harge Aird. The sonic texture of the 1950s is splendidly provided by Carter Burwell's score and a selection of classic popular music by artists like Woody Herman, Georgia Gibbs, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Perry Como, Eddie Fisher, Patti Page, Jo Stafford, and Billie Holiday."
" Outstanding
",0.6124,0.9749,2017-03-09 00:00:00,10,"What a wonderful film. I thought about it days later. All of the unfairness against women that you've read about is highlighted in this film. The legal system stacked in favor of men. The bigots that condemn same gender relationships. The control freaks that get into women's faces. It's all here. And a touching love story. And even the ending made me wonder what the characters decided to do next. If you're a bigot, you'll hate this film. If you understand the human race, you'll enjoy it. And talk about stepping back into the 1950's. The background and cars were wonderful. I felt like a time traveler. No wonder this film was nominated for so many awards, and won a few awards as well. Kate...the world is paying attention to you now."
" Worth checking out
",0.2263,0.8904,2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this movie, even though not much really happens in it. That is OK. There is definitely a place in cinema for character studies. You can call it a drama, but I'm not sure you could call it a psychological drama. Mara Rooney is a bit inscrutable as a mousy early Fifties single girl. You can say the same for Cate Blanchett, as the older (39-ish?) wealthy society lady. I doubt that it is giving much away to say that they fall for one another. Blanchett's character, Carol, has a lesbian relationship in her past, so it brings up the question ""Is she preying on the 21 year old Therese?"" (Rooney). It doesn't truly seem so from here. The performances seemed good to me, and the film has good photography, direction, and authentic-to-the-times costumes. If you don't require car chases and explosions in a movie, check it out."
" I can't help you with that.
",-0.3089,0.9931,2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"The opening shot of Carol focuses on what seems like an ornate, wrought-iron pattern, before pulling back to reveal filth: a forgotten floor grate on the streets of New York City, and the millions that have walked over it. The camera then follows one gentlemen as he enters real luxury, the restaurant of the Ritz Tower Hotel, and interrupts an intimate reunion. The two women swiftly abscond as if not to provoke further questioning. Much of Carol is concerned with these issues of appearance and reputation, and how people can be more than meets the eye. The film's favourite motif is to shoot Carol and Therese from and behind grimy windows, on the reflections of mirrors and glass, squeezed through gaps and doorways so we almost have to crane our necks to get a peek at their full profile. This partial obscuration reflects their fragmented sense of self in their everyday performance, to have to hide who they truly are. The seemingly single break of character from Carol comes in their second meeting at the diner, where she (once again) takes the initiative to push their relationship beyond simple gratitude, and nervously throws out a proposition for Therese to visit her home (lamely advertised to be pretty scenery, unable to fully hide her true intent), and for a tiny moment is breathless as the question hangs in the air. We get the impression that her life of luxury doesn't usually confront her with these types of odds. But more than that, she is putting her emotions on the line and risking losing it. Certainly the production has captured the allure of the angelic Carol and her sensuous beauty in its most potent form: the textural, tactile sensations which Therese is intoxicated by and what men cannot provide. The soft fur in the mink coat she seems to don like wings, the wave of blonde hair, the immaculately crimson fingernails, and vitally, the weight and feeling behind a parting caress on the shoulder. The pair must initially resort to seduction without lingering touch, so each fleeting hand hold or rub of the shoulders must be accentuated in their gazes, and each casual action, say, a throwing back of the shoulder to waft perfume across the booth, calculated and precise. The waifish Mara is given less to do as per her written role, but sometimes her tentative nature can be mistaken for inertia, leading to some accusations of the relationship being predatory. In some ways, this could seem true; the exquisitely porcelain Blanchett just about eats the diminutive Therese up with her eyes at first glance, and at times Mara just goes along with it. Todd Haynes is openly gay himself, and much of his filmography has been dedicated to advocating for this cause and capturing its anxieties. His debut was the scattershot anthology flick Poison, in which the visible edge and improvisation of a young filmmaker was evident (I still have no idea what the mockumentary of the flying boy is meant to signify). There was also the glitter bomb that was Velvet Goldmine, which had energy and flash reminiscent of Bowie's glam-rock peak but became embarrassingly pretentious once it retreated into its frame narrative. His big hit was Far From Heaven, a formalist exercise wrapped up in the gloss of Douglas Sirk but with a homosexual twist. He took Sirk's issues of classism and updated the story with modern moral responsibilities but retained the style. But Sirk's reappraisals were earned due to the subversive smuggling of his critiques in what were considered to be merely soapy melodramas. Far From Heaven wasn't made in the 50s but in a time where audiences and critics have seen it all, and although Haynes intent is virtuous, the people who really need to see it didn't give the poster a second glance. Its irony forbids it. So Haynes' best and most incisive film is Safe, which doesn't resort to well-tread pastiche, although its existentialist tones are familiar. Carol has a similar notion of earnestness. Gone is the glossy, highly saturated Technicolor, and in its place an earthier palette of yellows, browns and olives. In Far From Heaven the hyper-expressionistic cinematography gave the characters no place to hide, but in Carol, the colours envelop them. Edward Lachman shoots in 16mm so that the grain is highly visible, giving each frame a impressionistic haze. It's the closest to realism that Haynes has gotten since his very early days. The New York landscape becomes a character in itself, mapping Therese's maturation and emotional development: early on timid in its gaze, mostly capturing obscured faces and turned backs, but after meeting Carol, the subjects and environments come to life. It's all still very pretty, and at times impenetrable. The script tends to hold them at arm's length, unable to replicate the inner retrospection of the novel. Blanchett and Mara are gorgeous, too gorgeous, in fact; they rarely break the pretense of these painterly pictures, even as they are alone and away from prying eyes. Carol is never more exposed than in that one moment at the diner, even when they are entwined together in bed. And for all the arguments of category fraud regarding the two's respective screen time, it is Carol's story through and through. Even when Therese is making her own decisions the film is pushing her towards a different goal (the 'painting' of her apartment is merely a slightly lighter shade of blue - intentional, but shallow). I'm mostly and pleasantly surprised at the treatment of the ex-husband, not as an antagonistic force but channeled through impotent rage and the confusion at having his picturesque family shattered. It's happened before, and he won't forget that feeling of helplessness. But Carol's choice is the correct one. What good is a mother's love if she cannot embrace another's?"

",0.8126,0.9988,2017-01-26 00:00:00,9,"A love story set in 1950s New York, ""Carol"" has a grace and elegance about it that all great period romances possess, but as a love story between two women in the 1950s, a small but powerful dramatic bent elevates ""Carol"" beyond genre and beyond being labeled ""an LGBT film.""Story aside, ""Carol"" stands on a powerful foundation of artistic vision, production and performance. Todd Haynes (""I'm Not There,"" ""Far From Heaven"") was criminally denied an Oscar nomination for guiding this vibrantly realized recreation of the '50s that works from the outside in, setting the stage for knockout performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara.Although Blanchett is the tour-de-force playing the title character, the film is from the perspective of Mara's Therese, a young 20- something trying to navigate her big city life of a department store job and host of male suitors who becomes instantly intoxicated by Carol, a woman who comes into the store looking for a Christmas gift. From there begins this low-heat, smoldering romance that builds gradually throughout the film. The complication is that Carol is in the process of divorcing her husband (Kyle Chandler) and he's making things difficult for her and her relationship with their young daughter.Adapted by Phyllis Nagy from the Patricia Highsmith's novel ""The Price of Salt"" about Highsmith's affair with an older woman, ""Carol"" has elements of that deeply personal memoir feel. By focusing on Therese, Carol remains a bit more of the alluring enigma, a woman of wealth and elegance who seems to be something else entirely, whereas Therese is meek, impressionable and discovering who she is.Their discrepancies and the time they live in come most alive in Sandy Powell's costume design, with Therese's thrifty, vintage look compared to Carol's fur coats. Blanchett is always so enchanting to watch, so it's almost unfair that her character is arrayed in elegance. Again, all the elements â the costumes, the direction and the actress all come together in total harmony, drawing us into the story completely and most importantly, allowing us to see Therese's experience with the feelings that she experiences.Haynes' touch â and I use that word purposefully â is gentle and poised. His camera lingers as it needs to and calls attention to the powerful chemistry between the leads. We feel their every glance and touch, and while these characters' attraction to each other is palpable, Blanchett and Mara's reactions hit the sweet spot between obvious and subtle. The sexual tension mounts gracefully and Carter Burwell's score seems to perfectly accent every emotion.Fans of romance films, straight or gay, will be completely swept up in this affair, though the script never plays it up for purposes of entertainment. The execution is just so spot-on that the romance becomes as if not more compelling than the drama surrounding it. Some viewers will undoubtedly want more of the LGBT rights history component, but Nagy clearly hasn't written a historical film, she just wants to show how the romance â the core of her story â was affected by views on homosexuality at the time. Even deeper, ""Carol"" is more about identity than love, and how desire should shape our choices, even when our logic â and society â tells us otherwise.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Stylish and sensitively told, but not very profound nor special
",-0.5077,0.9986,2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"New York, 1950s. Carol Aird is long-separated from her husband, Harge. Their daughter lives with Carol. Harge keeps trying to win Carol back but to no avail. Then one day Carol meets Therese Belivet and is immediately attracted to her. A relationship develops and they fall in love. However, things get complicated when Harge finds out about the relationship and sues for divorce, using the relationship as leverage to win custody of their daughter.Aesthetically pleasing but not very substantial. There's a great style and sensitivity to the film. The fact that the love story is about a lesbian relationship in the 1950s could have been used to turn the movie into something for shock value, or try to go over old ground in terms of social mores, tolerance or civil rights. However, director Todd Haynes steers clear of these obvious detours and pitfalls and makes it into a classy love story. While this is a good thing initially, it doesn't help the movie in the long term. In the end it is pretty much a standard love story, just with the two main characters being women. There's really nothing profound nor special about it.Can't fault the performances though. Cate Blanchett, as Carol, puts in her usual excellent performance, and got a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts. The surprise performance comes from Rooney Mara as Therese. I always thought of her as acting in tough, action-girl sorts of roles (maybe because she starred in the US version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo), but here she gives an excellent performance in a dramatic role, showing great vulnerability and range. The performance earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination."
" Ageing creepy rich lady falls for younger selfish bimbo; maudlin and anachronistic
",0.128,0.9941,2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"The film is about a wealthy older woman who falls for a cute department store clerk girl. It is set in the 1950s, and although the physical sets are accurate, there is a lot of revisionist history in the story line.Did you ever observe characters in films who have every opportunity to be happy, yet seem to somehow be dramatically miserable? You just have a hard time feeling sorry for them.The older gal played by Cate Blanchette has a young daughter, and there are many references to how miraculous the child is. The fawning and consideration they give the child is nothing like the way kids were viewed and treated back then. It would have been more authentic if they had portrayed the parent kid relationship the way it was, where kids did as they were told and the world was for the adults. It would have segwayed better when Blanchette went all Kramer vs. Kramer and ran out on the kid too. People didn't fawn over kids back then the way they do now.Blanchett is great at being aloof, and and in that way she was born to play this role. She is well dressed and well healed, and plays a nose in the air snob so well it's scary.
Speaking of scary, when she meets the shop gal she immediately stalks her in a way that in real life would freak anybody out-YIKES!!! Good thing she's not a man, or they would have plucked her off the street and thrown her in a dark cell for the same stalkyness. Mora wasnt underaged , but they would use that whole ""power dynamic line"" to jail a guy for the same game.She is also married to a rich guy with movie star good looks, buys her a tutor mansion, is a great father and is madly in love with her. Yet, she is unhappy, not so much because she should be, but because she can be. It is unclear if Blanchett's wealth is from hubby or family money, but either way she certainly didn't make it herself. Her lifestyle of luxury and self pity are only practical if some guy is off making the moneyThe shop girl Rooney Mara is cute , but not too bright. She has a nice guy in love with her too, and other than a special needs type fascination with toy trains she has nothing to offer the world but a cute bod and perpetual dear in head lights stare. Oh yea, she is unhappy too, complaining constantly about always doing what others want her to do, yet we never see an example of what the hell she is talking about.The most interesting thing about the two gals is how totally worthlessthey both are. The shop girl basically works a job 99.9 percent of the population could do with absolutely no training, and Blanchett is never observed doing any work, AT ALL. If the world were filled with people like these two, it would collapse in a matter of hours because nobody would do anything expect worry about how unhappy they were, in spite of being handed EVERYTHING. ""OH , Aren't I fascinating? I am rich, good looking, kept, have guys chasing me, yet I am still unhappy-oh look at interesting me!!!!'I consider this film more of a mystery than a love story. You have a good looking young gal and a not too goofy looking rich older gal, both with love, money, options and yet they are still - UNHAPPY with a capital U. All they're anger is personified in the character played by Sara Paulson,who skulks through the film with an angry scowl so sour she could make a fortune if she could bottle it and sell it as a ""man repellent"". When Blanchett's husband tells Paulsonr he loves his wife as he is frantically looking for her, Paulson says-""I can't help you there"". Perfect line for the new Hollywood mantra-""Women and kids can do whatever they want, men don't matter"". The moral of the film is ""I can be as selfish as I want and if I break some guys hearts it doesn't matter, because the world revolves around ME."
" Just Didn't Feel the Connection
",0.0,-0.6489,2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Let me start by saying that I really wanted to love this movie. Blanchett is always amazing. But Mara's performance just didn't work for me as I didn't find myself caring about her very much. Her sullen moodiness was annoying as it was never juxtaposed with laughter and light. She didn't ""come alive"" emotionally around Carol except for a few moments in their passionate scene.I also didn't find relationships to be real. It was style without substance. What did Carol really see in Therese that would make her risk losing her daughter? When her daughter was around, Carol would seem so involved and yet wouldn't go on holiday with them and then later in the film only visited her a few times. She didn't really fight for her. Why did Terese's boyfriend even like her? She certainly wasn't kind to him. And there were plot oddities: Why did Carol carry a gun? Her husband didn't seem as if he'd be physically harmful to her. And how did Therese expect to pay her rent and expenses when she returned from her trip with Carol? Where was Therese family during the holidays? She did have none? And getting a photography job at the Times especially as a woman in those days, wasn't that easy. Anyway, the cinematography was beautiful. I just wish the screenplay had been written with more opportunities to show the advancement of the characters and their relationships in a way that made more sense."
