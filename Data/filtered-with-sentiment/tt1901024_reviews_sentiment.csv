" Grotesque Snoozefest
",0.0,-0.7402,2021-03-25 00:00:00,1,"The depiction of the women should make anyone repulsed. I hated this movie. Snuff Crap. Movies like this and Vacancy should be burned. It didn't help how boring it was when it wasn't a useless scene of violence or sex. Jim Carrey loses respect and should stick to comedy, if he ever gets another chance."
" Not an American style movie which is good
",0.4404,0.9741,2021-03-07 00:00:00,8,"First I kept waiting to see Jim Carrey to do a Dumb N Dumber role- I was serious - but not as. But he did excellent role reversal. If he did any other serious movies I'll be on the look out. The movie does move slow but I was a fan of Maigret, the French detective 9 season series where each episode was 90min and he was slloow, but you always kept on the edge what he would do next. This is similar. I'm all for fast paced action but this is a nice break. Other thing you wont get from this movie is how vibrant Krakow is, and rich history. The open food market each night. OMG. This movie is filmed in few drab places, maybe to signify communist era and stay with the mood. Overall its well worth watching unless you have way different taste."
" Underrated
",0.0,0.8765,2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,"What an underrated masterpiece. This movie has been made by movie lovers for movie lovers... To avoid spoilers I might sound cryptic at times - therefore, i will focus on the formal aspects of the movie. If you understand what you are seeing and hearing when you are seeing and hearing it you will love the movie. Every single shot that we see before our eyes is a photographical art piece in its own right, frames are used in a way that adds to the mystery without revealing to much. Frame by frame we are being forced to endure the darkness that has yet not been displayed, but also its counter-piece the everyday life of ordinary people , that gives balance to this dark theme. Jimm Carry is extraordinary - for a guy that did comedies, somehow he always thrives when he is dealing with dark material... Bravo Mr. Carry and thank you for this experience..."

I enjoyed the acrid, disturbing atmosphere created by lighting, music and movement. Like watching a sinister ballet on a grimy and poorly lit stage with a vague sense of depravity settling in, even though (or perhaps because) you don't really know what was happening in the shadows."

" Good film, dreadful ending.
",0.0,0.316,2020-12-20 00:00:00,4,"I wanted to see this due to Jim Carrey playing a serious rile which I thought he could have done well and he did.
The film was a very slow burn with no action scenes in the whole movie? How do you ask when it is a crime movie. Well that is why this movie is a slow movie.
The story is almost confusing for the viewer because of the short run time.
The acting was on par even though the film looked as if it was a low budget film.
But now we come to the ending which I personally thought it was a huge let down and didn't suit the movie, it looked as if they just put it in there.
As fir the two twists, the first one I saw coming a mile away, so it held no surprise for me. The second one was okay but didn't come as a shock.
So overall a good film, no action scenes, no tension, the twists didn't work and the ending was a let down.
Only watch this for Carrey' s performance."
" Actually a good watch
",0.4404,0.8233,2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"Despite the surprisingly harsh reviews this movie is good.
I think Jim Carey's performance is pretty good and a far cry from previous roles.
Acting is good all rounD and the dark brooding atmosphere is well directed.
It falls down on a weak plot that is very predictable."

" Wrong for Jim Carry
",-0.4767,0.6187,2020-11-19 00:00:00,4,"This film really tried to be fashionable and brooding but it just didn't work for me. Jim Carrey didn't add the charisma I usually see from him....at all...and I think the only reason he was in it is to draw people in to watch it, ironically at times it proved difficult to watch. It feels like the film needed something else to liven it up and felt blunt at times rather than clever. There are plenty of other examples of this type of thing around (such as the sinner) which draw you in much more so I'd suggest watching one of those on instead."
" Boring?
",-0.3182,0.9488,2020-10-24 00:00:00,8,"LOL, when you read a bad critic you can read this word (boring) frequently.
I guess this is not Fast & Furious, you don't have big explosions or Vin Diesel or the Rock jumping bridges. If you like that kind of movies this is not for you.
If you like stories more than ""visuals"", and can appreciate a good work, this is for you.
This movie is for old school people, who enjoy good narratives."

" That this exercise in vulgarity was made at all is shameful.
",-0.4939,0.8271,2020-09-27 00:00:00,1,"Carrey's quietly exacting, uncharacteristic performance, though not qualifying as a saving grace, hints at some promising new career directions in the same manner Robin Williams successfully tapped a darker side with ""One Hour Photo."""

The characters inside the story are so mysterious to a degree that you don't know who this is and why he does that? Both the director and the author have kept the truth to themselves on many topics. The main character, his actions do not coincide with the intelligence of a child, even though he was depicted as distinctive.
It is now clear to me why the movie is so low in box office"
" A good movie
",0.4404,0.8885,2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Love direction, easy to watch.... Not for Hollywood movie lovers."
" Interesting!
",0.4574,0.8966,2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"I thought this film provided a nice level of simmering dread and uncertainty. Yes, some of the events were predictable, but remember this is based on true events! Without knowing the backstory I felt like this was an interesting look at a slice of perdition, and now that I've done a little research it's even more psychologically intriguing."
" Steps of silence
",0.0,-0.535,2020-04-27 00:00:00,4,"While the story been told has the power to impact, the carrying away of the story sometimes falls in slowlyness, making it too long to watch.
The film uses a very simple structure, dialoge is not key while silence plays a major role in the picture, however, the film lucks the mastering of silence for a purpose.
Jim Carrey's performance is fairly decent, but I believe the character could have been more powerful so the capabilities of the actor could have had more accent and notoriusness on the whole story.
All in all, I would rate the film poor cause of its failing on geting the potential juice out of acting and storytelling!"
" Relentlessly grim look into shady ordeals
",-0.5719,-0.2114,2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Inspired by a news article entitled 'True Crime: A Postmodern Murder Mystery', Officer Tadek (Jim Carrey) obsessively clings onto a murder case in which a businessman has been killed in a shockingly similar way to the murder described in a book by acclaimed author Krystov Kozlow (Marton Csokas). As he grows closer to the lead suspect and his girlfriend, Kasia (Charlotte Gainsbourg) he creeps in and around emotional turmoil and twisted behaviour. Directed by Alexandros Avranas and written by Jeremy Brock (The Last King Of Scotland, Driving Lessons) it certainly doesn't shy away from the most depraved aspects of the human psyche. From the opening shots of sexual sadism to the unsettling descriptions found in Kozlow's book, it's a tough watch in places but earns its right to be. I almost thought from the beginning it may turn into something resembling A Serbian Film, which although is disturbing, notoriously ridiculous and extreme torture porn, does rely too much on shock value and loses any depth to it. Dark Crimes is not nearly as extreme and in this comparison, has much more depth, particularly in its more subtle moments. Carrey is absolutely brilliant in his most impressive dramatic role since Joel Schumaker's The Number 23. The pent up rage is spectacularly captured. Gainsbourg also continues to prove she is one of the most daring actresses in cinema today and creates another sympathetic and strong character. Csokas also deserves a mention for playing with audiences expectations and just being a damn good actor! The ending is also crazily great and accomplishes the nihilistic tone the film sets out for. Overall, a hard watch in places and not the most enjoyable for it, but a fantastic showcase of actors experimenting with harsher material and a morbidly fascinating observation of what goes on in some murder investigations"
" Very bad direction.. Not so clear with what actually director wants to tell
",-0.7611,0.9399,2020-04-10 00:00:00,2,"How can someone not make a proper use of talented actor like Jim carrey ?? ..worst story teeling, slowest than your expectations. No agitation between characters in a crime drama?? Ohh my godd... Background musics failed to create a mood... Let's say it was a noir but still it failed to pull viewers to its wrap. Jim carrey did best. Rest of the cast, including Marton, even did best.. EVERYONE DID THEIR BEST ACCEPT DIRECTOR AND MUSIC DEPARTMEMT.."
" No Passion
",0.2023,-0.8101,2020-04-01 00:00:00,5,"The filmmakers went into this movie wanting to re-create the drab, subdued, Euro detective vibe that pervades series like Shetland & Wallander, but instead they produced a dull, lifeless series of tedious scenes.Dialogue is minimal, the characters emotionless & the cinematography is static. I swear the entire movie was filmed with one camera & a tripod. The most movement on screen, aside from the first two minutes, is people walking. Literally, walking. The camera never dollies, never pivots, never even pulls focus. Master, close up, master, close up, ad nauseum. The film simply lacks any movement. It's like watching a 90-minute conversation across a dinner table.Apart from the walking & talking, there actually is a 10-minute story here, but Jim Carrey had no business telling it. His appearance (and accent) was distracting more than anything. Of course, without 'star power' this movie would have never left development.I love slow, deliberate storytelling, but a filmmaker must capture passion from his script, his filming style or his actors. Otherwise, he only bores his audience. Sadly, it is only here that Dark Crimes succeeds."
" Don't Waste Your Time
",0.3252,-0.2846,2020-03-20 00:00:00,3,This is a hard film to watch. I could only watch it 10 minutes at a time before I had to move on. The sun never shines in this grimy story. I finally got through it and wondered why films like this are made.
" Falls Flat
",0.0,-0.4986,2020-03-15 00:00:00,3,"As a person who enjoys atypical indie flicks, slow burn thrillers, and character-driven dramas, I found this an unfortunately boring movie (read: I dont need action-packed, fast-paced, in your face entertainment films). The pacing was poor. The ""big"" reveal seemed anticlimatic by the time we got there and I just didn't care anymore. The plot, the characters, everything felt disconnected and flat."
" An Incredibly Strange Film
",-0.2716,-0.5637,2020-01-24 00:00:00,5,"I'm not sure where to begin.
A Jim Carrey film with him in an extremely serious role? You got to be kidding me. We have seen various semi-serious Jim Carry roles over the years such as The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, I Love You Phillip Morris. But JIm Carry has if i'm correct only starred once before in another very serious dark film the Number 23, about man that obsess over 23 enigma and how that relates to his own life. IN Ture Crimes on the other hand Jim Carry plays cold police detective in Poland that becomes obsessed over an unsolved cold murder case that he decide to reopen the case after discovering that its awfully similar to crime novel he's reading and listening to as audio book. The case had previously ruined his career...where he only was an assistant on the case. To make long story short through out the movie we don't only get to see how the case continues to ruin his career but also how it creeps into his private life. Its interesting to see Jim Carry in such different role from what we usually see him in considering that most folk regard Jim Carry as comic genius considering his peak of popularity in the 1990s....This movie shows how great of an actor Jim Carry actually is although Ture Crimes will probably consider among his worst. Not because of his performance despite what some critics says rather how European the film is in its nature considering its filming location and how it had mostly European crew and cast. For peoples that are more used to American style of movie making the will not find much worth watching in this film, even if everyone involved do solid job at presenting an interesting watchable film considering it was actually loosely based on actual police murder case where where a novelist actually wrote book about some of his murders which got the police back on his tale. This film is actually worth the watch if you are a huge Jim Carry fan and you have to see every film he ever been appeared in as seeing him in such dark role is comical in on itself to say the least. If you are casual Jim Carry fan and you don't have to see every single movie of his then you are completely fine with giving this film a skip and watch some of his 1990s out puts insteeed."

",-0.8122,0.7096,2020-01-18 00:00:00,1,"The only interesting thing was Marton Csokas because he's hot and has a sexy accent. As far as entertainment, there is none.

" Dreary, dry, dull
",-0.6249,-0.7601,2019-12-21 00:00:00,3,"This movie had a depressing storyline, a palate of washed-out colors, and moved at a snail's pace. I don't mind a depressing story, but only if the film has redeeming qualities. I hate to echo other poor reviews, but this thing was truly boring. I had a big problem with the camera lingering on shots for 2-4 seconds longer than necessary, like the editor was padding out the running time. The beautiful photography wasn't beautiful enough to justify the constant lingering.The entire plot could be described to a friend in only a few sentences... This was a moody detective piece with almost no detective work. Jim Carrey does a terrible job here, monotone and stone-faced. He sometimes has an accent and sometimes doesn't, which would be funny if it wasn't apparent he was trying so hard. The final few scenes finally add a wrinkle or two to the plot, but it's not a satisfying resolution, and feels like a punchline, disconnected from the rest of the movie.This film gave me a lot to think about, and in all the wrong ways."
" Jim Carrey's most unusual role
",0.0,0.742,2019-12-08 00:00:00,5,"After years of over-the-top comedy, Jim Carrey played a serious role in ""I Love You, Philip Morris"". He now goes one step further with with the dead-serious ""Dark Crimes"", playing a detective in Poland investigating a murder. The whole movie has a gray tint, creating a bleak feeling throughout. Is this supposed to be a representation of Poland in general?The one downside is that Jim Carrey doesn't effectively do a Polish accent, lapsing in and out of it. Sometimes he sounds just like his characters from his mid-'90s movies. Otherwise, it's one of the most intense movies that I've seen. A person who only knows the movies that made Carrey famous would've never envisioned him in this sort of role. Then again, such a person would've never envisioned his anti-Trump drawings.Worth seeing."
" An Unsettling, Slow Burn Whodunit
",0.0,-0.9493,2019-12-08 00:00:00,7,"The ending absolutely made sense. The killing of Sadowski was perpetrated by Kasia and Greger, by and large, covered it up. Tadek was manipulated into arresting the wrong man and, therefore, the truth cost him his life: Kasia told the true story of Sadowski's murder to a dead man too obsessed and blinded by emotion."
" Not for the blockbuster crowd
",-0.4847,0.9877,2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,"If you're expecting a slick, compact whodunnit with loud dialogue, a couple of explosions, and the kind of dark dispelled by sunshine... this is not that movie.It's slow, dreary, maddening, and ultimately gives no neat ending.There is little dialogue, so every word is important. There is little light, even during the day, so every scene is important. Nothing is glossed over and there is nothing fake. The family life, the work life, the fantasy life, all portrayed in the quiet tension that holds back rage. To say this movie is intense is an understatement.I would give it a 10 just on Carrey alone, but the supporting cast is brilliant as well. The cinematography is amazing. The score is solemn and perfect.I take off one star because I guessed the ending too early.... sort of. There was a huge twist in the twist I wasn't expecting, and it ended darker than I thought it would.If you love film and have watched more than ""Hollywood"" offers then you will appreciate, if not love, this movie."

" Couldn't finish it
",0.0,0.9718,2019-11-16 00:00:00,5,I have always been a huge Jim Carrey fan and love his comedy a lot more. This film I was hoping to see him doing a more serious role but as the film keep being so stagnate I had to cut it short. I have read some reviews of what I missed and kind of wish I could have made it all the way though. But it just moved to slow for me and was kind of giving a whole depressing mood. With that in mind I am sure a few of you guys will love it and one day I hope to give it another go but until then 5/10 feels like a fair rating.
" Tired, Boring and Weak...
",-0.6369,-0.5627,2019-11-13 00:00:00,3,"This film surprised me. The dialogue was patchy, characters were brooding and uninteresting, almost all shots were dark and worst of all, Jim Carrey couldn't seem to figure out his accent. We slopped from one scene to another, barely feeling anything for anyone, let alone understanding what was going on. The only scene with any power was when Carrey went to his Mother's house near the end of the movie.I was surprised that Carrey took such a weak role. He's made many great films, but really missed it on this one."
" This movie is a crime
",-0.5423,0.4604,2019-11-06 00:00:00,1,"I like Jim Carrey and am surprised he would do this. He's a good actor, no doubt, and really the only redeeming quality this movie has. Plenty of good movies have a dark and depressing backdrop and this isn't one of them. It is incredibly slow and doesn't even really have a plot. This movie is honestly just another vehicle for Lars von Trier's ""muse"" Charlotte Gainsbourg to play another naked, hyper-sexualized, weepy sad horndog. Seriously, what is it with her? Can she even be in a movie where she doesn't take her clothes off? Tadek's wife is totally miscast. Sorry, but Jim Carey is a fairly good looking guy and you give him a wife that looks like that? She looks like his mother. I watched it for an hour and didn't even care what happened and turned it off. It's that bad."
" American account of Polish crime filmed by Greek director as if Nordic Noir
",-0.5423,0.2446,2019-10-30 00:00:00,3,"Jim Carrey can handle drama/thrillers (e.g. The Number 23). Here he was given a rather dull character and a poor screenplay; he does OK, no better or worse than anybody could have done.Its hour and a half running time is fairly excruciating in its pacing; the limited color palette and flat dialog certainly didn't help. Seemingly it was attempting to imitate elements of Nordic noir, but the original (""extended"") Män som hatar kvinnor (2009) was three hours long, and yet very engaging."

I think it's also important to point out that the writers of this movie clearly have a hatred towards women. I mean literally scenes of them being treated like dogs as well as an ending putting the woman as the root cause of all the trouble even after she admitted she was raped and treated grotesquely by the ""victim"". If you hate women just as strongly you will probably really enjoy this film. I couldn't help but be disgusted by it. Very apropos given the year it was released."
" Jim Carrey not being Jim Carrey--which shows how good this actor really is
",0.4404,-0.7345,2019-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Jim Carrey plays a washed out Polish detective, obsessed with his job and alienated from his indifferent wife and thoughtless daughter. It's like no role he's ever played, and he's good at it. Critics want to see Carrey in one of his usual roles and criticize him for this not being anywhere near one of them.

Especially considering how he allegedly had issues with Kick Ass 2 being too violent. Either that was false or he changed his mind? Whichever it is, this is quite a stretch for him (the themes of the movie that is): Sex and violence.Well I guess it had to happen someday. Still weird to see him in something as dirty and rotten like this. Not sure if it helps or works against it (not expecting him in a movie like this that is), but whatever the case is, this has a few flaws. Relying too much on the shock and twist effects, it kinda loses control over other things ... still overall decent if you can stomach the nastiness"

" Much better than I imagined, and far better than these reviews would intimate
",0.7003,-0.6187,2019-07-21 00:00:00,7,"My guess, is the bad reviews are at least partly due to American audiences having such a hard time with subjects this dark, depraved and unspeakable. There is such a degree of prudishness within the American soul, and it is accompanied by a kind of fake puritanism. As an American, it is something we have to work to overcome, if we are even going to make an attempt at being a well rounded individual. I can see why the European reviews are so much better. They are less burdened by the nonsense.Carrey is outstanding. He plays a very serious man, who is a somewhat broken individual, without much of a life, or career. There are some pretty difficult to watch scenes, which set the film up, and put you front and center, into the world of hurt core and pain.Carrey plays a character named Tadek. As Tadek tries to pin the murder on Kozlow, an author who has written a book about the murder, he becomes personally involved with Kasia, a woman whose soul is broken through years of abuse. Kasia is played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, who's is very convincing. As Tadek is lured into Kozlow and Kasia's mind games, he becomes somewhat entangled within this hedonistic world he once despised.Marton Czokas is brilliant, as usual. His intensity and his expressions truly make one wonder if he is a psychopath, or simply insane. He is a difficult to read character. His dialogue is great.This is not what I would describe as a brilliant film. But, it is worth a watch. And far better than what alot of this forum describe.

Fast forward to 2018 and it's released in the states and the reviews are mix to negative. I found this movie to be very good. The directing,cinematography and carreys performance were great. The third act is excellent and the ending I didn't see coming. Overall this is one of Jim's better films. I enjoyed this one as much as the #23. I hope Jim takes on more roles like this in the future but if your looking for a cop movie with comedy and explosions then you'll need not bother watching this one. I highly recommend you check this out!"
" Boring & Plotless
",-0.3182,0.8018,2019-07-19 00:00:00,4,"Dark Crimes could of been a great comeback for Jim Carrey. This shows that he is back to doing a dramatic role and it could of be great if the film wasn't so boring, tedious, and plotless.Jim Carrey plays this detective, Tadek, who is a detective trying to solve and unsolved murder that happens to resemble an author's book. He does everything he can in his power to crack this case, whilst dealing with really dark moments that are going on.This film did have some dark moments and Jim Carrey was good, but the film's plot was barely good, it was slow paced, and the ending was incredibly stupid to where it doesn't deserved to be spoiled.The fact that this movie was a letdown is depressing. Jim Carrey hasn't done a great movie since 2008's Yes Man. Dark Crimes was close to being good, but in the end was a lame movie and is on par with The Majestic and The Number 23 as being Carrey's weak dramatic roles."

" Not your typical Hollywood movie
",0.0,0.9916,2019-06-28 00:00:00,8,"This is not a movie for easy viewing.
It's also not a movie that follows the textbook of story writing for movies.The camera work, the way scenes are shot and the way they are set up are incredible. The very first shot already sets the tone for the movie as well as the camera work and framing to expect. The camera follows along from a distance only showing parts of the story leaving the rest to the imagination. The director was certainly inspired by David Fincher. I had to pause the movie and check to see if this was a Fincher movie because of the framing and camera work. Wide angles, steady tripod shots and over all great set-pieces and setups. Simply form a cinematographic point this movie is already great.The music doesn't try to grab any attention which would distract from what is happening on the screen. Instead it perfectly supports what is happening without being irrelevant and in places even increases the emotions, again without grabbing any attention.Jim Carrey, Marton Csokas and Charlotte Gainsbourg are all delivering great performances.
Jim Carrey doesn't talk much during the movie and he doesn't need to. His facial expressions and posture do all the talking, which makes every word he says important and makes you pay extra attention to what he says and how he says it. You can tell where his character is in his life and how broken and frustrated he is just by looking at his face during certain scenes. An absolutely gripping performance.
Marton Csokas also delivered a great performance. While I don't mind vulgar characters, it did at first put me off a little but after watching for a bit, I understood the character more and I realised that it actually fits very well. This is a movie with very few words and therefor a lot of the acting is done through facial expressions and posture. Just like Jim Carrey, Marton Csokas nails this. You can tell in what state he is in just by looking at his face and watching his mannerisms.
Charlotte Gainsbourg did a great job as well though I have to say that the movie didn't give her enough time to really show off her talent except in the last scene.Now to the story itself. The story has been told before, maybe not this exact one but this style has been done before. Is that a problem? No, not at all. If every move had to have a novel idea about it's story there wouldn't be many movies. It's rather about how the story is told and I have to say it's done well. Though I would've liked for the movie to be a bit longer. The ending is good but it would've hit a lot harder if the buildup to it would've been maybe 10 minutes longer. I don't want to go into to much detail about the story as I don't want to spoil anything.Over all this is a great movie. It is dark, depressing, at times even suffocating.
The cinematography alone could carry this movie but the great performances and the music just raise it to the next level.
If you're wondering why I gave it 8 stars even though I'm praising it this much it's because the movie isn't perfect. It's a bit to short, one performance was rather lackluster and it's lacking a little depth in the story department."

",0.0,0.9682,2019-01-08 00:00:00,8,"It was refreshing to see Jim Carrey acting a darker role. All I knew about him was that he's this funny guy doing awesome comedy. Seeing him being all serious and even a bit aggressive gave more depth to him.Of course the movie isn't about Carrey and after I got over the new view of him I really enjoyed the movie. For me the plot wasn't boring or dull. It didn't need guns, explosions and constant yelling to be intriguing. It was harrowing and dark. Even quiet at times. The protagonist didn't get the revenge or the goal he was aiming for. No one did. And that's realistic in a way.Sometimes it was hard to follow, but in the end you get the picture. Some things were left to open, but for me that's fine. You don't have to know everything.I think this movie succeed as a psychological thriller. It left me ponder after I saw it and I loved the atmosphere."
" JEER - (3 stars out of 10)
",0.0,-0.9316,2019-01-04 00:00:00,3,"The stage curtains open ...Dark Crimes is loosely based on actual events. A washed up detective (Jim Carrey) decides to open a cold murder case when he discovers details from the murder - that only the police or the murderer could possibly know about - contained accurately within a novel. Convinced the author is the murderer since details from the case were never publicly released, he does everything he can to bring him to light and to justice. As he pursues justice, the detective suffers great personal loss along the way, putting him into situations that will test his very limits.This is a very dark and brooding mystery thriller, though the word thriller really may not apply here. The film fails to build the needed tension to the story's final reveal and twist ending. What the movie does promote, is the dark and brutal side of police work in its ugliest form - along with all the corruption that exists therein. Jim Carrey actually did well in his somber, serious role, so I don't blame the film's failings on him. He has solid support from actress Charlotte Gainsbourg as well who was completely believable in her role.However, the film falls flat, no real suspense is built, and the final scene loses steam, making it's last twist a ho-hum and a shrug. I would say this movie is worth viewing once, but nothing noteworthy and certainly not a recommend."

",-0.0823,-0.0872,2018-11-24 00:00:00,8,"The movie's 4.8 IMDb rating as I write this seems terribly unfair. The reviews that take down the picture relate to it's slow pace and dark, brooding atmosphere, and I get the sense that the misogynistic treatment of women turns a lot of viewers off. Well, aside from the political correctness of modern day society and the idea that real emotions shouldn't affect one's personal sensibilities, I thought the picture was a fairly compelling one. I'm not familiar with the real life case that inspired this story, but I don't doubt that it was just as fascinating. What I wasn't used to seeing was Jim Carrey in a role in which he wasn't dumb and dumber. There was only one scene in which his eyes gave away a hint of his more familiar characterizations, and it was fleeting enough that one couldn't say it was misplaced in a somber film like this one.The story did all it could to paint Krystof Kozlov as a reprehensible character, and he didn't help himself with statements like ""Thank you for wasting my time"" to an interviewer, and ""Truth is what you make it. Reality is perception"". Here was a man with total anger at the world who may not have even known why. Tadek Vietzek's (Carrey) interest in Kozlov becomes an obsession to solve a closed murder case with an apparent underlying motive to discredit the man who became his police chief. That he finally does so leads to dire consequences for himself at the close of the picture, a twist in thefilm that is only revealed when Kozlov's woman Kasia (Charlotte Gainsbourg) relates the story of how one Daniel Sadowski really died at her hands.With Jim Carrey the only well known actor as part of the cast, his graying beard and grizzled facial complexion add a resonant somber tone to the story. Being of Polish background myself, I hung around for the post film credits to marvel at the Polish names associated with the making of this picture. Aside from the principal players, keep a sharp eye out for understated cameos by Malgorzata Krukowska, Lukrecja Nagabczynski, and Wojciech Graniczewski. Who knows if you'll ever see them again."

Setting aside the gratuitous nudity and depraving scenes, the film really struggles to make much impression. It overworks the serious tone and stark setting. Jim Carey succeeds at changing his persona but his character is featureless and anonymous which gives the film a feel of irrelevance.

Alicja is your story.
You talked, he wrote it down.I suppose it's almost impossible to use an exuberant color palette for a film situated in a Slavic country. Every time the story takes place in such a communist or ex-communist country, the screen is filled with depressing colors. The closer one approaches Russia (the motherland of communism) the more gray, grizzled, and duller the images become. The desolation and gloom are splashing off the screen. Everything seems bare, simplistic and simply boring. To camouflage this problem in a film, one must have a fascinating and intriguing story, played by colorful actors. But that's missing in ""Dark crimes"". Even Jim Carrey has an impressive, gray beard. With a little imagination, you look at it as if it's an old-fashioned black and white movie.""Dark Crimes"" is based on an article from the Washington Post about Krystian Bala. A writer who described an unsolved murder in detail in one of his books and was arrested based on this. Perhaps an interesting item to make a film about. But here the pace is similar to writing a book. Painfully slow. And Jim Carrey couldn't remedy that by himself. This goofball who got in a fight with God Himself, who got plagued by a gang of penguins and who put laxative in the coffee of his best friend, wasn't so bad in this more serious role. Unfortunately, his career has marked this good man. I expected any minute a spastic grin while doing an absurd dance with lots of leg-swinging. Personally, I think it's quite logical because that's the kind of movie role I associate Jim Carrey with. There aren't many comedians who succeed to convince in a serious film.The only thing this film radiates is dullness. And not just because of the scenery. The story is immensely long-winded. And as a fill-up, additional plots were added. So you'll be presented with the story of the degraded detective and his will to take revenge on the injustice done to him. Obviously, you get the story of a detective who wants to solve the last case before he retires. A bit like Morgan Freeman in ""Se7en"". But this time it's because he wants to see his name fully cleared. There's also the neglected wife who can't longer cope with the absence and obsession of her husband. And finally, there's the sex slave Kasia (Charlotte Gainsbourg), girlfriend of the writer Kozlov (Marton ""The Equalizer"" Csokas), who's the culprit according to Tadek. She's a drug addict and her SM past creates sinister images.There are only a few moments you could call exciting. And that's every time the writer Kozlov comes into the picture. His pseudo-intellectual jibber-jabber may not be essential from a substantive point of view, but his charisma and personality fill the screen completely. These were a few moments when you could feel the tension and intensity. Perhaps Charlotte Gainsbourg also caused a certain tension with certain images. However, all praise for Jim Carrey who impressed me, in an otherwise not so impressive film. His stiffness, resentment and the moments in which he realizes that he was wrong (with gagging as a result), are brought in an excellent way by Carrey. But that's about it in this mediocre film."

I grew up watching Carrey like EVERYONE did as the rubber face crazy comic genius but there is NO trace of that Carrey here at all!!! 
Here is a powerful performance by the ""New"" Jim Carrey & i loved it.
Dark Crimes itself is a very dark & dreary Crime Thriller & I'm not going into the story because this should be watched not knowing really anything about it except it's a dark crime Thriller & that's how i watched it, i didn't read or watch a single review i just heard about Jim Carrey doing this very serious crime Thriller & waited to buy it on dvd. 
So yeah this is a very good Thriller with a very moody atmosphere & very dreary & dark with a serious & excellent JIM CARREY who gives a fantastic performance with an accent!!!

" Dead End for Carrey
",-0.6486,-0.9724,2018-08-03 00:00:00,1,"Jim Carrey isn't funny in the Polish murder-mystery ""Dark Crimes"" as a determined detective on the trail of a devious killer. He has already made a fool of himself and gotten demoted to the job of a lowly records clerk. Suddenly, he believes that he has the solution to an unsolved murder. A man was killed and hogtied, and Carrey's detective Tadek has noticed a similarity between the murder and a novel written by a nihilist. Ultimately, this grim, drab-looking feature, whittled down to 92 minutes by director Alexandros Avranas boils down to an exercise in brooding with some incidental rough sex thrown in to add a note of notoriety. Carrey wears a thick beard and has his hair cut short. Tadek isn't particularly a strong character. Primarily, he is a restless cop who doesn't want to end his career sorting reports and records, and he targets the most likely suspect, a novelist named Kozlov (Marton Csokas of ""The Equalizer""), who eventually admits that he is the murderer. Out of the blue, our hero learns that his chief suspect wasn't in the country when the murder was committed. ""Dark Crimes"" lives up to its title. Carrey looks lost in this sinister saga, but Csokas soaks up the atmosphere, and he rules the film. Unless you enjoy watching movies about losers, you should skip ""Dark Crimes."""

He is so obsessed with this case that he ignores his family. He finds similarities between the murder and details found in author Krystov Kozlov's (Marton Csokas) novel because the details of the actual murder were never released to the public, but Tadek sees them in the novel. He believes he has his man.This will be very slow going. In the beginning, we see a lot of nudity when scenes are shown in the sex club that Koslov goes to from time to time. After those scenes we no longer see any frontal nudity. . Talking about a sex club where girls were also tortured would have sufficed, but the Director wanted more. See?There are very few dialogues throughout especially from Tadek. As Tadek, Carrey uses a Polish accent, but I have heard better as he does it with almost no accent. Not good. And Carrey as Tedak sports a beard that makes him almost unrecognizable. I did wish that Carrey as TAdek spoke more about the case so we knew what he was thinking. Didn't happen too often.The two main characters alongside Carrey are excellent. There is Charlotte Gainsbourg as Kasia, who is Kozlov's girlfriend; and then there is Marton Csokas as Koslov and he gives off a such commanding presence, I kind of wished he was the good guy. I have always said that comedians have timing down perfectly when they go into drama. Jim Carrey has that in here. Kudos. There will be 2-twists later on.

It's based on real events, it has a really strong cast playing solid interesting characters. And then there's Jim Carry. Here he comes back to film in this dark (very), disturbing film. For a while I watched him waiting for that smile or a big fail but Jim Carry is rock solid in this. It's a good but story told with skill in the style of older foreign (FRENCH) films though its set in Poland. It's kind of remarkable really.

Its an interesting story which this film strays from dramatically, inventing in the whole 'sex club' sub-plot and completely changing the ending.

But at the same time, I don't think it is as terrible as the critics and a lot of people claim it to be - but isn't good either. It is not original or unique. Also, it is not a typical Hollywood cop drama with shootouts and explosions, in fact, it is not a cop drama. It is a psychological crime thriller. That's the best way in which I can describe it. It is dark and filthy. It has a considerable amount of violent ""intimate"" scenes and some graphic scenes quite similar to that. So, if you find those grose - don't check it out. Speaking of the story, it has one of the most generic ""previously prestigious cop due to some recent past events is now living a miserable life with a broken family and wants his prestige back"" character played by Jim Carrey. And, a lot of it feels like an adaptation of ""Basic Instinct"" (1992) rather than some real events it claims to be - with some minor alterations. There is an author who writes erotic stories and is suspected to be the one behind it - but just not what it turns out to be in ""Basic Instinct"". The scenes, psychological manipulations, etc seem so similar to it - with different interpretations. Whatever they did with Carrey's character is simply the obvious cliché of what happens to a generic character like this in a dark world set up by the movie. The first reveal was predictable - after you know what's going on. And, it was the most obvious thing again. Doesn't make the movie worse, but at the same doesn't make it better. The second reveal was something I didn't really see coming in the way it did. But it feels really too much of a lazy writing and over the top. And, the way Carrey deduces things in the way he does while investigating is also something we've seen a number of different times. I didn't hate the pacing and the way it was going - I thought it was fine. Jim Carrey gives a very nice performance on his part. I loved him in this movie. I have seen his ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""The Mask"" and absolutely loved them. And besides these, I might have seen Ace Ventura movies and probably ""Bruce Almighty"". I don't recall watching him in a role like this and giving a performance like this. But again, I have watched only few of his movies. So, I don't know if he has done a similar role and given a more powerful performance. Sadly, on the whole I found it frustrating.

I liked the movie. It is slow paced yes, but it does not drag too long. I enjoyed the filmography and the direction of scene (it actually reminded me of Mr Robot) with a slight twist at the end.
All the shot/reverse-shot scenes between Jim Carrey and Marton Csokas were amazing. And Jim Carrey playing the cold detective is also very good. 
I recommend it, unfortunately, others do not becuase it's not an American cop drama with lots of shooting explosions etc. If you expect that, do not see the film"

The story interested me and so I was excited to check out the movie, particularly considering it had the always great Jim Carrey in it. The film was probably about what I expected in a lot of ways. Very dark and bleak and almost zero attempts at humour (yes confirming Jim Carrey is indeed in this movie). What totally caught me off-guard though was that the film ended completely differently to how the real life version of events did. I can't ever remember seeing that to this degree in a ""based on a true story"" film. Although I do notice that the film never actually posts that tagline anywhere, and perhaps for just that reason.The film certainly isn't a barrel of laughs, but it kind of works in its own way. Jim Carrey gives his all to the performance, of that there can be no question. He seemed like an almost broken man and I wonder in some ways whether the recent goings-on in his life were the reason he took this role. From my perspective the story this is based on worked better in podcast form. When you know the story from the beginning to end, with all the details included it really is quite fascinating. The film tended to gloss over the most interesting aspects and then completely changed the outcome. It's certainly not must-see stuff, but you could also do worse on a lazy Sunday evening."

First off if you're an American it's probably true to say you'd have to be a fan of ""foreign"" films. It has a very European look & feel to it and the plot and pacing is very non-Hollywood. I'm grateful for that, being a fan of ""foreign"" films myself.
The ending as many have said had a bit of a twist but I sort of expected it. It didn't quite hit me as hard as the ending of say, The Vanishing by George Sluizer (the original, not the terrible American remake with Jeff Bridges or the terrible, terrible remake of the remake w John Cusack) but it was still right in line with the sobering unsettling type of endings I like. An added plus was that it was in English and I didn't have to read subtitles. So much is lost in reading subtitles rather than understanding the language spoken in the film. Vocal inflections and nuance are lost if you are not fluent in the language spoken in the film. There was no problem with that here though. I recommend giving this film a try, if only to see Jim Carrey stretch out well beyond his usual shtick and do it astoundingly well."

" not compelling
",-0.1695,0.6323,2018-05-18 00:00:00,4,"Greetings again from the darkness. A neo-noir ""inspired by actual events"" and based on a compelling 2008 ""New Yorker"" article by the great David Grann (THE LOST CITY OF Z) seems to have the necessary components for a satisfying thriller. So what went wrong? Unfortunately, a messy script from Jeremy Brock (THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND) prevents this one from ever having a chance at grabbing our attention, much less holding it. This is the first English language film from director Alexandros Avranas (MISS VIOLENCE, 2013) and his cast is led by Jim Carrey as police inspector Tadek, a disgraced cop who takes care of his elderly mother while also obsessing over the now coldcase that ruined his career. Carrey sports a Polish accent through ""most"" of his performance ... a performance that is mostly subdued, especially given his career. Joining him as co-leads in the cast are two other excellent actors: Martin Csokas and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Csokas plays Kozlow, the main antagonist and suspect - an author with clues to the key murder highlighted in his novel. Ms. Gainsbourg is underutilized as Kasia, the former sex worker, now intimate acquaintance of Kozlow. She is the key to solving the case.Grann's article entitled ""True Crimes: A Postmodern Murder Mystery"" told the story of novelist/convicted murderer Krystian Bala. It's an article worth reading and one that bears only passing resemblance to this screen adaptation. The film is purposefully drab, bleak, dark, grey and dour, with a stark, cold look to the characters and most every scene. Tadek is a man on a mission to save his reputation, even at the expense of his family life, or really any life at all. The game of cat and mouse between Tadek and Kozlow never reaches the level of tension that the film seems to think it does ... even in the one-on-one interrogation scene or the seemingly endless blabbering of the recordings Tadek listens to.There is a terrific international cast of supporting actors including Vlad Ivanov, Robert Wieckiewicz, Piotr Glowacki and Agata Kulesza, but the cast is only able to do so much with the material. Perhaps the draw is supposed to be Jim Carrey is the darkest role of his career. On the bright side, the story is neatly wrapped up at the end thanks to one character who deserves a ""win""."
" Sad but true
",0.3919,-0.9942,2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"A film that in a blunt and true way shows what the real world is. It's sad but true. The world is not Wonder Woman, the world is brutal, if you are weak then you lose. It annoys me that all reviews of the film criticize the violence against women and the bluntness shown. Why? This story had to be shown just like that. The film is based on facts and these facts were brutal. Why are all reviewers so politically correct today? It limits directors! Hypocrisy is shocking because the same reviewers do not mind violence against men or bad exploitation of men but are obsessed with women. Stop. Stop to see everything through the prism of political correctness."

The most disturbing movie this year, not because of the violent/ sexual tortute the ""Rated R"" suggested but the movie itself is terrible, boring, zero stories, acting was terrible, production wise umm okay.. but everyhing else just literally fell Flat I gotta hand it to them, filmed in 2015, should've stayed hidden all those years , VERY disappointingWith a good backstory, this could've been something"
" Enjoyed this movie and the subtle way it presented a dark story.
",0.5106,0.9879,2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,"Watching this film I first off have to say I loved the way Jim Carrey immersed himself into his role. Some people only like him when he is playing humorous roles, but I feel that his serious rolls such as this one (and others like The Number 23) are well portrayed by him. I felt that the film had a well developed corruption murder crime story line to it. I was able to foreshadow the ending a little, but it still was a good film that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The portrayal of Tadek, by Carrey was well developed and showed human character flaws that were subtle but well intertwined into the story. I love the way that David Grann, (the writer of the original story the movie is based on) ended the story with a marginal twist like adding a twist of lime to a cocktail after you have already drank half the glass and ate the olive. This film is not for everyone, but I do recommend giving it a watch, if for nothing else other than seeing Carrey explore a roll away from humor again."

" Amazing !!!
",0.6884,0.7351,2018-05-03 00:00:00,10,"Jim carry is something else in this one.
great story And a surprise ending."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,0.802,2018-04-30 00:00:00,3,This movie is a complete waste time.i was hopeful to see Jim Carey in a serious role. He is a great actor. The storyline could have been good. The music never helped out. Very monotone throughout the movie. Almost fell asleep at times. Was not even with on-demand fee.
" Boring
",-0.3182,0.3071,2018-04-25 00:00:00,3,"Don't waste your money if you have to rent this one. I kept waiting for something to happen in this movie, but it just never did! Very predictable ending!"
" Just GREAT!
",0.729,0.9284,2018-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Jim Carrey is amazing on this movie! I loved everything about it! I couldnt blink my eyes, what a great and criative history!"
" Torturous when not sleep inducing
",-0.5719,0.8718,2018-04-20 00:00:00,1,"With Jim Carrey starring, I was hoping for a showcase of his talents, in however dark a story. I thoroughly enjoyed Robin Williams' turns in ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"" so...
Halfway through I decided that the dark crime was giving nothing to say to dynamic loquacious actor Jim Carrey."
