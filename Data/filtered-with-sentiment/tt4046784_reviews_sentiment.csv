" Full of action and with a great production dsigner and visual effects, The Scorch Trials happily points to darker paths in episodic acts
",0.8271,0.8772,2021-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Maze Runner proved that it could be one of the recent hits amid so many children's adaptations around Hollywood. After the good performance of ""Maze Runner"" in 2014, it was not long before 20th Century Fox gave the green light for the adaptation of the second book of the trilogy created by James Dasher. As soon as they left the premiere, the entire team on that tape has already started working on this ""Maze Runner - Trial of Fire"", in a rush that did not affect the final result of the production.""The maze was just the beginning"". This time the marketing campaign is not exaggerating: while Maze Runner - Run or Die, it brought a single scenario and a precise obstacle (to overcome the maze). Now Thomas, Teresa, Minho and the other young people have to deal with a very different reality: The Earth's surface has been burned by the sun, they must combat an infinite number of mortal dangers. When they escape from scientists, they must survive the desert crossing, when they pass through this stage, they must deal with misshapen creatures called Cranks, then with rebels, then a lightning storm that seems specifically aimed at them. All the people, beings and machines around want to kill them; every shed that could house the group hides new traps. The world is really cruel.In this context, Maze Runner: Trial of Fire considerably expands its universe to become a great action film, with many special effects combined with the rules of other genres (zombie films, post-apocalyptic films, catastrophe films, teenage adventures). This production has a larger budget, and also broader ambitions, aiming to seduce the adult action audience. Unlike the tense and gloomy ambience built with great care in the predecessor iteration, here we already see the unspeakable influence of futuristic dystopias that, without a doubt, begin to draw more parallels with audiovisual and even literary franchises that began in the last century and last in a saturated way until today. The result is agile and technically impressive, however, in the desire to please everyone, perhaps it will not delve into any genre.Again directed by Wes Ball and scripted by T.S. Nowlin, the feature begins exactly where its predecessor left off, with no introduction for newcomers to the franchise - that is, it is necessary to watch ""Run or Die"" before venturing here. Upon discovering that their ""saviors"" work for the CRUEL organization and that they would be used in a scientific experiment, the boys flee the place where they were placed, discovering that the outside world has turned into an inhospitable place, where the climate and the people affected by a virus that turns them into zombies makes the survival of the group doubtful, to say the least. In search of contacting a resistance group to CRUEL, Thomas and his friends find the young Brenda (Rosa Salazar) and her tutor Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito), survivors in the midst of this post-apocalyptic scenario that serve almost as guides for them in this not admirable new scenario.By opening the film with a prologue that shows how Thomas ended up in the hands of CRUEL and further developing the interior of the organization headed by pragmatic Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson), the script adds depth to the conflict between the gladers and their pursuers, something that makes Teresa's dramatic arc (Kaya Scodelario) become much more intriguing and even tragic, making this plot the best of the film, mainly due to the young Scodelario's compositional work, effective every time it is triggered - and it is a pity that she no longer has screen time. That's because Thomas's dilemmas are certainly the film's weak point. The character of Dylan O'Brien continues to lead the group with his inexhaustible arsenal of virtues: he is intelligent, charitable, beautiful, friendly, courageous, tireless, he devises the best plans, runs like no one and never leaves anyone behind. Even if the person in question already has a certain death, Thomas prefers to risk his own life to accompany the dying person. As he always makes the right decisions, without hesitation - unlike Katniss or Tris - the hero becomes uninteresting, somewhat superficial. Fortunately, O'Brien is an actor with resources, bringing some hesitations to this bastion of morals and good manners.Wes Ball maintains the level of the previous production, only this time he is a little more restrained. If before we had a camera shaking all the time and quick cuts, now the director is betting on the most agile and frantic narrative. Along with the script by T.S. Nowlin and Dan Zimmerman's editing, Ball's conducting works very well, not letting the film bummer when you link one action scene to the other or even not making room for many expository dialogues. On the other hand, the production continues to insist on excessive suspense as a resource to prepare the ground for a sequence - which, obviously, ends up hampering the progress of history. At one point in the projection, for example, one of the characters tells Thomas that he asks a lot of questions. In a way, this is how we stay for a good part of the tape: full of doubts, because we are being introduced to a series of new elements all the time, but they are not very well explained. At first, this tactic may even work, producing some effectiveness; when we reach the middle of the film, however, the resource begins to irritate and, in a way, leaves the viewer lost due to the amount of new elements that are being inserted without the slightest elucidation.Despite the rush to set the tone of the narrative, there is an interesting plot behind this rampant pursuit. While the first part of the trilogy focused on allegories such as the myth of the cave and themes taken from ""The Lord of the Flies"", here the central plot is based on an inversion of the natural order, with the elders seeking to kill (or ""harvest"" "") The youngest to try to survive and recover the old social order. Children have their roles demarcated from an early age by adults and a role to follow, not being given the right to choose their own destiny, but through struggle and rebellion.The great difference of this second film is its episodic character, which approximates the plot of a sadistic video game. Assuming that the audience already knows the characters, the action develops without any brakes, bringing each new segment with its scenery, its characters, its ""villain"" to overcome, as in the stages of a game. Overcoming that danger, young people are ready to run to the next trap. Perhaps this frantic road movie lacks a sense of purpose: where do the characters really intend to go, if nothing around is trustworthy? Among the post-apocalyptic worlds of children's books, none is as bitter and nihilistic as that of Maze Runner.In adults, the highlight is Giancarlo Esposito, who embodies a survivor with a spark of humanity within him, represented by the love he has for Brenda. Aiden Gillen, on the other hand, maintains the sinister and seductive kind that he presents in the ""Game of Thrones"" series. Patricia Clarkson this time has time to develop her Ava Paige, the ever-expanding Alan Tudyk basically caricatures a drug dealer, while Barry Pepper and Lili Taylor basically bridge the gap as the leaders of the resistance.Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is also interesting and slightly superior to the first, but it has silly flaws in its content, problems that could be solved with a better observation of the script. Among the nonsense seen in its long duration, I mention some that are difficult to swallow: there is a scene in which an armed boy revolves using bullets against oncoming security guards instead of shooting the lock that holds the exit door. It also sounds forced to flee quickly to a mall very close to the premises, and the place is not even surveyed by the soldiers, even though they know that the young people have just escaped into a desert storm and are looking for shelter. And then the scene in which Brenda (Rosa Salazar) is supported by a glass - similar to what happened to Julianne Moore in The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) -, and it starts to crack with each movement of the girl, but it doesn't break when a Crank falls on top and there is a fight on the spot. Not to mention the fact that young people run away from the laboratory and spend days in the desert without food and little water...While in the first film, the production design and the action scenes were praised for their originality, here Wes Ball decides to appeal to something more common. Despite the correct design of the CRUEL installation, the post-apocalyptic world of ""Maze Runner"" is not very different from that seen in the ""Mad Max"" franchise, for example. Even the zombies and the set pieces themselves involving the creatures seem to be pulled from the game ""The Last of Us"", with the filmmaker showing a worrying lack of originality in his second feature. However, we must praise the battle that marks the third act of production, very well conducted.Towards the end, the production happily points to darker paths, with mention of sex, drugs, bloody fights and some morally questionable decisions. The target audience remains the teenager, but director Wes Ball's ability to suggest adult ideas within the PG-13 censorship is commendable. The characters would become much more complex if they let their adolescent drives flow in this extreme war scenario. In addition, the announcement of the third film as a ""revenge story"" looks promising. If the writers manage to create a cohesive story and reduce Manichaeism, the third Maze Runner may indeed represent the culmination of this story. After all, the franchise discusses important topics, such as the exchange of freedom for security, the limit of the intervention of science in nature and the role of the single state in relation to the will of individuals. We just need to find space to develop all these ideas in the midst of so much rush."
" Not so bad at all
",0.4708,0.6943,2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"I honestly don't understand why so many are so negative about this movie. Yes, it wasn't that original as the first movie, but you can't say it wasn't entertaining or a B quality movie. Lots of scenes were very well made, for example the tunnels with the infected people or the club scene. Why do movies have to be original in order to be good? Maybe it's just me, but I enjoy good scenes of known themes."
" Great movie that continues the story
",0.6249,0.8952,2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,"The movie continued the first one with a twist, but was amazing. Although the movie had little boring parts explaining the story, it was still absolutely great"

",0.0,0.7418,2021-02-07 00:00:00,3,I was hoping this movie would hurry up and finish! So slow and drawn out. And those zombies! The first of the series was way better. Finally I can go to bed.
" This Maze Runner without a maze is a dissapointment.
",0.0,-0.4019,2021-02-01 00:00:00,5,"After the exciting first movie, this was a bit of a dissapointment. The maze itself was the biggest asset of #1, and here, in spite of the continued use of the original title, there's no sign of any maze, but for a big part of the movie the group wanders through endless desert-like dunes, to at last turn up in an equalley uninspiring camp-ground. Luckily in between there are some exciting scenes in a wasted city-center. But another bummer: no threatening giant monsters, just lame zombie-like people.Then there were these numerous illogical things, like the group being followed from the air, but still they walk unhindered like conspicuous sitting ducks in broad daylight along the open dunes or sit at night around blazing campfires. And the wanderings are evidently supposed to take many days, but we never see them find, or even want for food and water.Anyway, as an action movie it's okay, and I'm a big fan of Dylan O'Brien, but as a worthy sequel to The Maze Runner it fails, here it's all in all just some kids endlessly on the run for some bad people, nothing more."

" Where is the maze?
",0.0,0.7089,2021-01-30 00:00:00,5,I really liked the first maze runner movie. Original and smart. That isn't how I would describe the sequel. The other thing missing was an actual maze. The only thing left was fast pace action and eye candy.
" Everything Is Fine Untill The Last Minutes
",0.2023,0.8226,2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Plot: everything is good, fine, intrigued and well described, until the last 10 minutes where there is a behaviour about Wiked that I really did not comprehend.
Anyway this one is more horror than the previous one, so be aware of it.Actors and Actress & Acting: a very good work from everyone.Visual Effects: well, also in this movie most of the scenes are in the dark, so you can not well see every monster, but still is well done.Soundtracks: very very good. It goes along the movie perfectly.Conclusions: another good movie but not at the level of the first one since the final drop (there is a nonsense action that leaved me puzzled)."
" Pretty good, but I hated the zombies.
",-0.5789,0.9756,2021-01-29 00:00:00,7,"After the success of the first film, the sequel was expected. And I was pleased to see it, as the first film leaves everything open and raises our curiosity for what comes next.In this film, Thomas, Teresa and the boys from the labyrinth goes to a place where there are other young people, from other labyrinths that apparently existed elsewhere. However, it is evident right from the start that the place belongs to the terrible medical organization that had kept them trapped in the maze. After they manage to escape, they discover themselves in a ruined, arid and devastated world, where the only human beings who are there are sick and maddened zombie creatures.The film is a good sequel and rises to the level of the previous film. The only thing that disappointed me was really seeing that the sick humans were similar to the living dead of a thousand and one films and series like ""Walking Dead"", for example. I expected something different. In any case, it was not unpleasant and allows for good action scenes and runs amid the ruins. The plot twist near the end is intense, unexpected and in fact allows for a very well done finish. The pace of the film is pleasant too.The film has a very good cast, and maintains the hard core of the previous film, as it had to be. Dylan O'Brian remains a good protagonist and does a very safe job. Scodelario received better material and her character was much more developed in this film, which allowed the actress to do a more interesting job. The love interest of O'Brian and Scodelario's characters is developed and credible. Ki Hong Lee and Thomas Brodie-Sangster also do a very good job on this film. Giancarlo Esposito is a welcome addition. Rosa Salazar is more effective as an action figure than in the inglorious task of making a love triangle with Scodelario and O'Brian, where she fails miserably. Patricia Clarkson is a weak and uninteresting villain, although she tries to look bad. Aidan Gillen was more effective in this task.The film has excellent production values and there is a lot of money tied up in high quality CGI that makes the whole world look like a deserted, inhospitable, poisoned and ruined place. Infected human creatures, as I said, are the least positive thing in the film, as we have seen better zombies in other films, where it is clear and assumed to be zombies. The film has excellent cinematography, is visually magnificent and makes the most of light and colors. However, it is darker than the first film. The soundtrack also deserves mention. Composed by John Paesano, whom I did not know, it is an intense soundtrack, with an epic and deep sense."
" Fun Despite Story Flaws
",0.5106,0.9935,2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,"A lot better visually than its predecessor, but the story is weaker and it's a bit too drawn-out to be truly engaging. The setup in the opening hour and a half is great - it reintroduces the characters well and made me intrigued in the mystery of the film. Unfortunately there are just too many repetitive scenes towards the middle of the film, and it slows the pacing down a whole lot. What saves this from a negative score in my opinion, however, are the visuals, which are surprisingly great and increase the grandeur of the film. There are some great supporting performances from Alan Tudyk, Giancarlo Esposito and Patricia Clarkson, who are clearly all having fun in their roles, and overall, despite the story not being the best, I did enjoy this, and if you liked the original then you'll probably like this one too."

",0.0,-0.8834,2021-01-19 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to enjoy this film, but I just couldn't.
The story was ok, acting was fine, but I just couldn't get past 'Thomas' acting the hero at every turn. It appeared the film makers wanted this guy to be the only one to notice any danger or offer encouragement, as a result he grated very quickly.
His dialogue was frustratingly annoying, consisting mainly of "" go, go go"", "" keep going, keep going"", ""get inside, get inside"", ""Don't move, don't move"" and the all too frequent ""No, no, no, no"". Within half an hour I was hoping he'd be killed off quickly, but knew, sadly that he'd be the one to pull the gang together and see them through it all.I haven't seen the first instalment and judging on this one, i won't be."

The acting, filming, cinematography and VFX are the best part after the deeper and more engaging screenplay with much faster-paced actions. Congrats to the writers, director and especially the cast who realistically delivered above all.

" Wasn't a big fan of the books so the changes made in the movie didn't really bother me
",0.0749,0.9649,2021-01-06 00:00:00,9,"First off, production-wise, this team did not hold back. CGI (was it CGI idk don't come for me I'm not familiar with editing terms) was fantastic, effects were top notch and the music score was amazing.Acting-wise, Dylan was great. He has always been a fantastic actor but I'm glad to see it in a YA role.This movie was action-packed and it gave me all the sense of adventure I needed. I just wish we had more scenes with the OG people to make this all the more sentimental."
" Just another pointless sequel...
",0.0,0.8031,2021-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Oh dear lord. Well, the 2014 ""The Maze Runner"" movie wasn't exactly a grand gem in cinema history, but at least the predecessor was way more watchable then this 2015 sequel titled ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" turned out to be.Granted, the storyline in the first movie wasn't really interesting, nor making much of any sense, then the storyline in the 2015 sequel was making even less sense and proved to be much less entertaining and less watchable. It felt like the storyline in ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" was just made up on the fly as director Wes Ball was making progress in shooting the movie.And it was strange that the sequel was so much more worse than its predecessor, especially so given the fact that they managed to acquire a handful of bigger names to appear in the movie, with the likes of Giancarlo Esposito, Aidan Gillen and Barry Pepper appearing in ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"".I lost interest in the storyline about halfway through the movie, yet I managed to endure the movie to the very end. But honestly, the last half of the movie was just watched with one eye on the screen and one eye on social media. Man, this was a trivial and pointless movie. There is a snowballs chance in Hell of me ever returning to watch ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" for a second time.This 2015 sequel was a massive swing and a miss from director Wes Ball, and my rating of it settles on a generous three out of ten stars. This is not a movie worth the time or effort."
" Not Interesting Enough
",-0.3089,0.8885,2020-12-20 00:00:00,6,"Scorch Trials is an ok movie but is a definite step down from The Maze Runner.It lacks some of the creativity and imagination of the first movie, illustrated nicely by a predictable trip through the 'zombie' shopping mall.Much of this movie seems unnecessary and only real seems to exist to set up a fairly obvious plot development.Its still entertaining...just."
" Major improvement over the first movie.
",0.4588,0.9559,2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"Lead actor learns to act 20 minutes into the movie, resulting in a drastic decrease in amount of cringe released on-screen. Characters and story are believable and interesting enough to make you care. The bad guys actually have a legit motive for doing what they do instead of just evil, with capital E, where you don't need to explain anything, they're just the bad guys. All of these leads to massive increase in my enjoyment of the movie.Watching the first movie feels like a chore, but watching this actually made me want to watch the third movie. Definitely something I would recommend to friends when they want something you don't have to follow 100% to still enjoy."
" Great amazing movie!
",0.8478,0.9272,2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"So, lets just talk about how amazing the movie is? Idk why people are hating on this movie! James did an amazing job writing and the producer of the movie did too because he included terrific scenes in the book into a mild-terrific scene. Also, I think that it was like a little bit simple (zombie apocalypse). The scorch Trials was better than the first movie. If you watch this movie, you will be amazed! The actors played they role perfectly. I rate this movie 9/10 just because they made Teresa evil and she betrayed her friends :("

I don't remember why I saw this in theaters I think I was with my dad, but none of the characters are likable and I didnt care when anything happened to any of them. It's just mor young adult trash, there is to much of this kind of movie and they are all to similar, if you've watched any movie, you've seen this, there is no need to watch it."

They are kept in a secure underground facility where scientists seek a cure and believe that these kids hold the secret to immunity. When they find out what will become of them, they escape, trying to avoid storms, zombies and renegades.In some respects, more interesting than the first film, this sequel to the 2014 original bares little relation to James Dashner's book so popular among teen readers which disappointed many of its fans. Instead it is a playbook of such post apocalyptic franchises as the RESIDENT EVIL, MAD MAX and THE HUNGER GAMES films that involves a lot of running around and irritable repetitive dialogue of folk shouting ""go, go, go"", ""let's go"" or ""move, move, move"" to the point of irritation."
" More mildly warm than scorching hot

However judging the film on its own merits it's certainly an acceptable action sci-fi flick. It maintains a strong pace throughout, there's a few jumpy moments and ok perhaps it panders to the zombie zeitgeist but at least it's well executed. The characters remain sufficiently engaging to pique my interest for the third and undoubtedly final instalment. If you're searching for Friday night thrills with no mental effort you could do far worse."

Outside of the kids cussing, the primary reasons why I have downgraded my rating is because one, the ""cranks"", two, the storyline itself and three, the supposed love story. I'm not big on the zombie thing anymore. This movie does well without the zombie stuff. The storyline loses me a little because the reason for testing the kids doesn't make sense in relation to finding a cure to the Flare disease. How does testing brain activity in times of stress create a cure for a disease that's obtained by getting bitten? Especially since the movie showed that the kids were clearly able to get infected just as easily as anyone else. Thirdly, the romance between Thomas and Teresa...I had no idea they even liked each other! I did not get that from the first movie at all. And honestly, the story has so much content that a romance is not needed. So, like I said, bittersweet...but overall, good."

" Without proper backstory, the movie will disappoint you
",-0.4019,-0.7707,2020-04-27 00:00:00,5,"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a science fiction movie directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brein, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Ki Hong Lee, Patricia Clarkson, Barry Pepper, Rosa Salazar and Giancarlo Esposito. The movie is second in the Maze Runner Trilogy.I haven't read the book so I will write my review purely on my viewing experience. I felt that this movie proves it's title as the characters are just running in the movie and story is been pushed in between their running.The movie gets boring and with cliche dialogues it increases your boredom. There are lots many loopholes in the movie. When they know that they are chased by WCKD why they still walking in the night that too in desert as desert could be very warm in the days but soothing cold in the night (Remember they have torches with them to guide in the night and the can easily switch of the torch whenever they hear any plane or copter is approaching). When they knew that they are hiding what is the point of switching on the lights while hiding in the shopping mall and let's say they on it by mistake they could've switched off it immediately instead of running like headless chicken (remember they have torches and emergency lights).The acting is ok but most of them were with flat faces. Screenplay is uneven and gets boring. The twist in the climax also doesn't excite much.Without proper backstory and execution this movie will surely disappoint you."
" Climax let it down

",0.0,0.5346,2020-04-20 00:00:00,6,"Well, if you are looking for a collection of good looking folks lurching from one perilous scenario to another - desperate to escape the clutches of the arch villain that is Aiden Gillen; then this is the film for you. If you are looking for anything remotely akin to the books that tell of the continuing adventures of Thomas, Newt etc. as they attempt to defy the will of WIKD, then get ye hence (as Shakespeare might have said) for this film has nothing for you. Gillen has all the terror-factor of Mary Poppins and whilst Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario and Thomas Brodie-Sangster; along with a seriously hammy Giancarlo Esposito look like they are having some fun with their escapade-driven flight; the dialogue is all over the place and the story lacks any sort of structure. The effects work well and the battle scenes are well put together but, ultimately, it is a sort of ""Percy Jackson"" version of the story; watchable but forgettable and not in the same class as the first film."
" AN AWESOME & EXCITING APOCALYPTIC SCI-FI THRILLER
",0.5106,0.2256,2020-04-07 00:00:00,7,"The Maze Runner films are an Awesome Trilogy & i think i like this part ""The Scorch Trials"" best.
Here Thomas & his crew are on the run into the dangerous desert wastelands called The Scorched Earth, a place full of Danger & most dangerous of all are the Infected humans who have turned into Zombie creatures called Cranks. These ""Cranks"" look Awesome & make for terrifying creatures that are out there ready to rip-apart any human. This film has a more Horror feel to it & that's why i loved it best. There's an incredible, intense & exciting sequence where Thomas & his gang are in a buried building in the sand & it's dark & scary & full of ferocious killer Cranks that chase them through the big old building/Mall type place & it's so intense & scary & a proper Horror movie scene.
The characters are all great again here, especially Thomas as the troubled leader of the group & we get, much later in the movie, a great Little role from Barry Pepper, one of the most underrated actors out there & one of my personal favourite actors ever!!! Here the always intense & rugged Barry Pepper plays a tough wasteland warrior named Vince & although it's a small part for Pepper it's a great role & he steals the show as soon as he's on screen.
Here Thomas must survive the scorched earth & evade the evil WKD empire. A thrilling adventure.The Scorch Trials is a blast of Action & Apocalyptic sci-fi Horror with a great ensemble cast & great effects."

In this one, however, we get all the excitement of the first one, in addition to a great plot. This movie is essentially a zombie movie. It's like a PG-13 ""Walking Dead."" It's actually pretty scary. I read the books, but this movie took the excitement of them and cranked (no pun intended) it up to 1000! Seriously! Don't watch this movie alone. And don't take little kids to it. It's PG-13 for a reason, and even then it is a hard PG-13. It's not inappropriate aside from some profanities, it's just really intense. Even though I read the books and knew for the most part what was coming up, I still jumped a few times! I'm really excited for the next one, and disappointed that I have to wait 2 years for it instead of 1.

",0.0,0.0152,2020-02-18 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed the first film (even though I found the ending a little disappointing). There was enough in the first film to keep my genuinely interested in where the second one would go.It starts out well enough, everything seems fine, then we find out what's really happening to them, and obviously they have to escape. What follows is nothing more than a generic zombie flick. Whilst you're watching this, you completely forget about the originality and intrigue generated by the maze and I genuinely found myself wanting it to end.It began to remind me of a sort of Hunger Games meets I Am Legend, whilst not really achieving anything near what those films did.I will watch the third one because of the 4 hours invested already, but I don't have high hopes."

This is something many viewers fail to understand. To those who hated the movie because it is so far off of the book, that was the point. They did it with purpose. They made one hell of a movie to sequel the maze runner. The scorch trials movie brought us action, suspense, and helped to develop a plot far stronger than the scorch trials book did."
" Forgettable mess
",-0.3612,-0.4797,2019-11-21 00:00:00,4,"I recalled the first movie being somewhat interesting, the mystery components were good, and among all the hunger game trend movies, it was unique. This on the other hand, was a mess. The characters were all stale (not so much the acting but the writing), the story is a cobbled mess, and I was very aware I was watching a movie, and when there were scenes meant to be emotional or exciting, I never felt in the moment, or identified with the characters, because they felt plastic, underdeveloped, that mixed with the predictability of it just makes the whole watch feel like a chore. Side note: This is a peave of mine, but why in so many action movies do the characters throw their gun as soon as it runs out of ammo? Early in the movie a gun runs out of ammo, and the character just throws it back to the villains, and later in the movie walking through the desert, someone throws an empty canteen. Things like this which don't need to be in the movie and are just like a generic movie cliche take me out of it. Like, these characters are meant to be great survivalists and scavengers and resourceful, don't you think it's massively stupid to run out into a dessert without a gun, ammo or not, i mean you could still use it to bluff or strike with, same with the canteen, like, you could fill it up again later, it weighs nothing. I know, I know, a silly gripe, but when you throw stuff like that in a movie because its a movie cliche, when it contradicts the character and atmosphere you're trying to build, it makes an already plastic generic movie even worse. Moving on, there's very little explanation of what is happening, and that worked well for the first movie, because the mystery was for a small contained story and cast. But now that the world has opened up, there's still very little information being conveyed. I don't mean that in the sense that the movie needed to just hurl exposition at the audience, It's one of those movies where if the lore interests you, just go on the Wiki or read the books (?), but this was just a boring mess."
" Decent but end is to Cliché
",0.0,0.7567,2019-10-01 00:00:00,1,"So, the movie is a good filler from the first one to the third and really isn't to bad except the ending. I mean, a military group that's been fighting another military group, that had look outs in a canyon that shot at the main characters did NOT have a look out for their camp at night? Come on!!! You could see those helicopters miles away. And any group in a combat or survival situation always, ALWAYS has a look out. It's a small silly thing but the whole ending could have been prevented by a simple commonly used tactic. It's fiction and silly stuff like this happens all the time, but that's the problem, ALL the time haha"

I haven't read the novel yet, so, I don't know what they are saying is true or not. But as for me, this film is also very good to enjoy.The disease known as the Flare is something that attacks the brain, but it isn't a zombie virus. People who infected by that disease will not turn into Zombies. But in this film, they changed the basis plot and turned into Zombie film. I'm not saying it's not good. I like Zombie films but changing the foundation isn't cool. If it's not Zombie in the novel, then it shouldn't be Zombie in the film too. That's the law.Anyway, except for the fact, everything is fine. The original score, the acting, the directing, the sound edition, special effects and all, everything's perfect. There are some scenes that make you excited. Those scenes can really make you excited. That's why I love this film. All in all, although there are some arguments, the film is still good and enjoyable."

Luckily there are some new interesting characters introduced that last pretty far into the movie. We also get introduced to the disease that plagues the planet in more detail. Everything I'm saying is pretty much just what the movie it, the only way to describe how good it is is to say it is just a continuation of a series of young adult films based off a series of young adult novels. The one thing I must point out is that there is a single scene (when music plays and things explode) that is done very well and provides epic visuals."

While I can understand and appreciate some changes in movies adaptations, I can't understand how the book author could allow and say he agreed with what the movie made of it. All that made the book great is lost in the movie and I could barely watch the action non-sense going on till the end of it. Even the title doesn't make sense anymore as in the movie going through the scorch is not a trial at all and that was the most disappointing at all, along with it being so much ""softer"", less mysterious, cryptic and cruel than the books. For once, I really loved all the casting, but the plot was completely ruined. I find myself hoping in a remake much closer to the original story and saddened it couldn't have been done with the great cast they chose for this one."

It's not until Thomas starts asking questions of his surroundings that he discovers they are in yet another WCKD place, so a break out is made. Once free they journey on the dangerous, yet open road. Rather than just fleeing to safety the intention is to traverse ""the scorch"", a barren terrain with unimaginable dangers, and search for clues about WCKD and their evil motivations. Along the way they meet the remains of humanity and experience different emotions to boot.I have to admit, I didn't enjoy this as much as the first film in the trilogy - the first one was new and unique, this felt as I had seen it before - or at least seen a grown up version of it (I just can't quite put my finger on what film I'm thinking of). Cross a college movie with a watered down Mad-Max film and you are heading in the right direction.The acting is decent although not outstanding. The scripting is not too complex, and points are repeated over and over so you won't get lost if you come into this film having skipper the first film. Action and CGI are authentic enough. And those are the positives - the big negative; if you have read the book - avoid this film like the Flare virus, it'll leave you angry at home much liberty has been taken with a decent source material.Average. I won't be writing home about this, won't miss it, and probably won't remember having watched this in a year. 5 out of 10"

The story and the characters all seem worn out and clichéd. It's also a shame that this movie can't really stand on its own.

I wanted to know why they put people in the maze in the first place and why Teresa and Thomas worked for wickd but suddenly were put in the maze etc etc.This movie is just more than 2 hours wasted on more questions than before. Half of the lines are: ""come on, let's go!"" ""What is going on?"" And ""You'll see"" and the worst part is that you don't even get to see or even understand what the h*ll is going on.

" Sinister survival story
",-0.5994,0.9354,2018-06-21 00:00:00,8,"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is the second part of the dystopian trilogy about a group of teenagers immune to a virus that has decimated humanity who are hunted by a shady organization. This great second part is an improvement over the solid first movie.First of all, this second movie is much more sinister than the first part as the teenagers have to fight creepy creatures roaming in an abandoned world. Especially the scenes in the mysterious underground shelter in the first third of the movie are quite intense. Overall, the varied locations add a lot of atmosphere to the film. Light and sound techniques are executed flawlessly. The creatures also look quite haunting.Secondly, the action sequences in this film are more intense than in the previous movie. One sequence that really stands out is when Thomas, the leader of the teenagers, and Brenda, the rebellious sister of one Thomas' deceased soulmates, have to fight their way through a shaky skyscraper with numerous traps. This sequence feels like a vivid roller coaster ride.Thirdly, the movie continues to develop the intriguing characters that made the first film so successful. Thomas is shown as brave leader who secretly doubts his capacities. Minho continues to convince as athletic, courageous and resilient young man. Newt represents the intellectual side as he always asks the right questions with a careful yet caring demeanor. In addition to this, the film introduces a few new characters that are quite intriguing. Aris is a quiet outsider who turns out being an observing and smart teenager who saves his new partners from certain death. Jorge is a resilient man with an unpredictable character who can be very caring about his friends in one scene but brutally torture former partners in the next scene. His protegee Brenda is a tough girl who doesn't shy away from conflicts with older men.Obviously, the movie also has a few minor flaws. The story is quite predictable. The film has two twists, one shown in the first third and the other one at the very end of the movie. Both of them are very predictable and the fact that the group of teenagers aren't immediately aware of them after everything they have gone through in the first installment, makes them look somewhat naive. Personally, I also dislike Teresa's character. She always seems cold, distant and manipulative and never truly helps her partners. She makes me think of Kristen Stewart, not only physically but also regarding her behavior. That isn't meant to be a compliment as it's impossible to empathize with her. Brenda is a much more distinctive female character while Teresa's character doesn't seem to be fully fleshed out.In the end, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is an improvement over a good first installment and makes you want to watch the third and final part right away. This film has great atmosphere, breathtaking action sequences and intriguing character development. Those who like dystopian science-fiction movies in the key of the Divergent or The Hunger Games franchises can't get around this franchise. Make sure you have watched the first part and to watch the third and final part later on."

It seems the earth was destroyed by scorch or something and a zombie virus called ""flare"" had infected the general population as the WCKD look for a cure, that for some reason can never be synthesized, reproduced, etc.We have a typical post apocalyptic society with destroyed landmarks, zombies, and pockets of people living in remote areas. I personally liked the version where Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) was played by Milla Jojovich. But hey, that's just me. It excites me more for a supermodel to save the world than a bunch of teens.Action, shooting, killing, and zombies.

The original Maze Runner deviated from the young-adult romance trope that plagued the recent adaptations after Twilight ended and it received mixed-to-positive reviews. While fans of the book series either hated it or found it ok, it was considered by many to be a much better young-adult adaptation. It had mystery, it had thrills, it had action and it had emotion. People liked it and so did I. Then, a year later back in 2015, I saw the sequel hoping it would live up to the first film, but while it was a decent enough sequel, it did disappoint me and I understand the mixed reaction from both critics and fans of the second book ""The Scorch Trials"".There are some positives that worked in the film. The cinematography is really gorgeous including the buildings and the actual desert, not to mention it's solid make-up and CGI effects on the Cranks. 61 million dollars went into the production and much like the first film, it was well spent. John Paesano, who scored the first film, did another solid job in delivering the same stuff he did from the atmosphere to the action music. Wes Ball, who directed the first film, delivered another top-notch direction. Also, the acting continues to be great with Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Alexander Flores, Ki Hong Lee, and Patricia Clarkson continuing to deliver excellent performances as did the new supporting cast including Giancarlo Esposito, Alan Tudyk, Rosa Salazar, and Aidan Gillen as the Rat Man, Jorge, and Brenda. And then, there's the action sequences which are more intense and action-packed including the chase scenes. Those set pieces alone are worth watching if anyone else checks the movie out on DVD.That being said, there are some drawbacks that disappointed those who loved the first film and the book series. First, there's the writing, which sadly does feel a bit weak and borrows sources from other zombie-genre related stuff. Not only that, it deviated from the second book despite having some bits of elements which caused an outrage to fans. Also, while the film delivered on the action and thrills, it lacked the mystery and emotion that made the first film work. Not to mention the plot and character development were severely lacking. The new characters were well introduced, but no depth was given to them. Then, there's the pacing which is sadly another weak element to the film. I don't mind two hour films but only when they have development for the characters. The original film had brisk pacing and took it's time for Thomas to interact with the other Gladers and becoming a really great leader and those characters were the ones you cared about. There's some of it here but not enough considering the weak writing and it's deviation from the source material.Overall, The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a decent enough sequel and it delivered what it promised in the trailers, but sadly, it wasn't nearly as engaging as the first film. I haven't seen The Death Cure yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed it would be an improvement. 3/5"
" So, so, so wrong
",-0.6877,0.9502,2018-02-02 00:00:00,2,"For a long time I didn't want to read the books but I did watch the movies. At that time I thought this movie was amazing and then I read the book. Oh my word, I love this cast because they are pretty freaking awesome, but they really, really, really went off book. I mean the main plot is the same however 99/100 things that happened in this movie are incorrect. If this is your first time seeing it and you haven't read the book just assume that everything you're watching is incorrect, because it probably is. The Cranks are overdramatized, the whole rebel gang in the desert thing NEVER HAPPENED and Teresa was pretty much NEVER there. And Rat Man, whom I love, doesn't look like Rat Man!!!!!! Plus the whole ""their blood is the cure"" thing is sooo incorrect, because the Flare infects your brain like cancer or a mental illness, which then has residual effects on the body. So to take their blood would do nothing to fight the Flare. On the other hand the movie is entertaining to watch, if you are not watching it for the story. Therefore I would give it a 7 based on how entertaining it was and a 2 for how inaccurate it was. I do have to say that based on this movie I don't think the next one, the Death Cure, is even worth seeing. If this one was so inaccurate the Death Cure will most likely be much, much worse."

",0.0,0.9972,2018-01-27 00:00:00,5,"Wes Ball continues as the director of the Maze Runner franchise and counts with T. S. Nowlin to help him with the book-to-movie adaptation of The Scorch Trials.The second installment picks up right where the first one ended. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers keep searching for clues about the real purpose of WCKD while teaming up with a resistance group of survivors in the middle of the Scorch, a destroyed landscape with virus-infected humans.The Scorch Trials had a tough task to start its story considering that the ending of the first film is pure nonsense and the reason why I almost did not rate it positively. However, The Maze Runner has several points in its favor and I felt entertained throughout the movie until the last 15 minutes. With this in mind, the first half of this film surprised me a lot!The Scorch Trials starts off strong and it does not take long for the Gladers to become aware of their ""situation"" and to synchronize with the viewers' knowledge. Thankfully, the stupid ending of the first movie does not spread for too long either and Wes Ball entertained the hell out of me for one hour-ish (the other hour is when the problems start to arise and develop). He has an outstanding eye for action, there are some amazing chasing sequences that honestly left me jaw-dropped. They are riveting, tense and the camera work is incredible, even the shaky cam is very well-handled.The cinematography transforms the visual quality of this film, even though it lost its claustrophobic atmosphere that I loved in the first movie. Still, it is a damn good looking film with great editing and an excellent score. This time around, the ending at least makes sense and it effectively finishes the movie, instead of completely destroying its story like in the previous one.One of the exceptional features of the first movie is the cast and everyone that keeps portraying their roles in this one becomes even better. Dylan O'Brien is astonishing once again. I mean, this guy is extraordinary, he has a great range of expressions and he easily connects with the audience. Thomas is also the most important piece of the trilogy since everything is based on him, what he did and what he means for the future of the world, so it is a perfect match between actor and character.Kaya Scodelario plays a more active Teresa and she definitely raises the story. Her character is basically a plot device in the first film, but now she is well-developed and she actually has something to do. Teresa's path throughout the movie follows an interesting progression and there are a few cool twists along the way, even if they are a bit predictable.Ki Hong Lee (Minho) and Thomas Sangster (Newt) also have neat performances, but here is where the film starts to crumble. There are a lot of new characters introduced in this movie and some of them are actually portrayed by well-known actors. For example, Aidan Gillen (Janson) and Giancarlo Esposito (Jorge), from the famous Game Of Thrones and Breaking Bad. With so many talents added to the cast, it is a pity that their characters are not developed at all ...The second half of the film entirely changes the movie and it turns into something I've seen a thousand times in action films. It lost its originality and mystery that it possessed, it stopped looking like an intriguing story. It is literally based on running from point A to B with big action scenes in exchange for character development. There is never a sense of urgency until the last 15 minutes and since the characters just appear from nowhere, I can't care for any of them. The new characters who I enjoyed watching, I did due to the actors portraying them, not because the characters were great.Consequently, the movie's tone and pacing are deeply affected. The balance between action and story-development is not adjusted at all, the movie goes from one running scene to another with barely any storytelling in between. It is entertaining for the first 45 minutes or so, but the second act slows down and it holds too many cliche sequences for me to tolerate.All in all, The Scorch Trials starts off great, with some amazing chasing scenes and phenomenal direction from Wes Ball. The nonsense ending from the first film is quickly put aside in the first act and the original cast improve on their already excellent performances from the first movie, especially Dylan O'Brien. Technically great in regards to cinematography, editing and score, but very disappointing story-wise. The second half feels like a cliche action movie with rarely decent storytelling, consequently breaking its pacing and tone. Some new characters should have added something more to the story, but they end up not being developed at all and The Maze Runner franchise wastes its potential once again.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Worse than the first one.
",-0.4767,-0.8685,2018-01-27 00:00:00,6,"I have not read the books, but from what I've read, this completely flies away from the original plot. But because I don't know the books, I will give my opinion on the movie alone. It is way more boring than the the first part plus all the action is concentrated in a long run away from the WCKD, which I did not like. The ending of the first one was pretty emotional with the death of Chuck, which felt like the movie succeeded in most of the aspects. But this one did not deliever the same way. The fact that the movie is full of zombies running everywhere like in the most of the cliche zombie films ruined the feeling for me. 6/10"
" What happened to the plot?
",0.0,-0.9467,2018-01-17 00:00:00,4,"As a standalone movie, it'd be alright in terms of execution. Except it's not a standalone movie. It's a film adaptation of a popular book. And this does not resemble the book.What made the Scorch Trials unique is now much less prominent. This is just another post-apocalyptic movie with zombies, an evil organization, and a rebel group. In making it a movie, it has lost its shine.I don't have a problem with the acting, sounds, cinematography, etc.; mainly just the plot. Admittedly a bit of the character development seemed rushed despite the film's extended length, but that's not the main point.I read the books first, so I viewed the movie based on a reader's perspective. And as I'm sure you know by now, the plots are nothing alike. Most importantly, they ruined the concept of Cranks.Cranks are now nothing but zombies that can run fast. The original author didn't mention the word ""zombie"" a single time in his books, but that's what Cranks are now. In the book, the Flare (disease) could travel by air, but in the movie that's not the case, or else half the living people would be dead. In the movie, it spreads by Cranks/zombies biting you or scratching you, which one might notice as being just like mainstream zombies.Also, Cranks in the movie don't know how to form coherent words, even though in the book Cranks could repeat phrases or even speak somewhat coherently. This is all wrong. Cranks are supposed to be infected people battling lunacy with rare flashes of humanity, not just moaning braindead zombies.WCKD is also, somehow, even eviler than in the book. And some of the main characters are changed (Teresa is a deluded traitor, Vince is another person entirely, Aris is actually useful).There's lots of elements that you can see the filmmakers had to put in for drama, but instead can make you bang your head on the table. There's the standard horror movie cliché (""oh hey there's the exit! I could run out there right now and escape to freedom! No wait, I hear a creepy sound. Guess I better investigate with my flashlight and complete lack of weapons""), then there's how Thomas doesn't seem to know how to escape (""zombie chasing me? Gonna look backwards ten times instead of, you know, running""), and also how people don't seem to know how to deal with scary stuff (""I'll just keep shining my flashlight on these zombies that are trying to get up""). The only reason Thomas hasn't died ten times over is because he's in a YA movie.It's been said that the last movie in the series, the next one, will keep the plot back in touch with the actual story. My hopes aren't very high, but I guess we gotta wait and see."

" Nothing to Tell at All
",0.0,-0.9562,2018-01-06 00:00:00,3,"Watching this makes me feel like I am watching a compilation of other stories and movies combined into one in a terrible sequence. For this one, nothing is told at all. I mean, it's such a drag and in the end, there was just nothing interesting.This is exactly an obvious of a plain thing tries to be cool. I don't even change my opinion about it since the first one. I thought I would change my mind because of the third episode. But no, it was the same terrible.A zombie problem, check.
Betrayal, check.
Memory loss, check.
Flash backs, check.Everything is so predictable to the point i almost convinced myself that i have a talent in prophecy. Man, seriously... this sucks bad."
" Boring zombie movie!?
",-0.3802,-0.9855,2017-12-26 00:00:00,2,"This movie is bad. The first movie in the series while not amazing, was still interesting and made the viewer exited to find out why/what/where/who?
But this sequel is an absolute disgrace, same as with a lot of these kinda ""Tween"" movies, the pasing is completely fucked, new charecters are introduced early on and the killed without having any development. And oh did i mention its a fucking ZOMBIE MOVIE!!!??? This movie has almost nothing to do with the first one, its a completely new world, with boring charecters and badly filmed/coreographed action scenes."
" A huge disappointment!
",-0.3164,0.9441,2017-12-04 00:00:00,5,this film had so much potential. the first film wasn't to bad at all and many people have told me that the books are brilliant but this lets it all down. the plot line is non-existent and the acting is very bad! with just under two months until the 3rd film comes out lets hope that it has a good ending to the films. 5/10 for the scorch trials.
" Mostly set up but can be fun...
",0.0,0.9904,2017-11-26 00:00:00,5,"A decent action film, like the first. Some scenes can be extremely tense, particularly the chase scenes. Most of the CGI was good, but could still use some improvement. The city sometimes looked a little too fake in my opinion. All of the action is quite thrilling, the glass scene being intense. The acting was also good, my favourite being Aidan Gillen from Game of thrones. He is amazing at playing a deeply unlikable villain. Certain characters are not given enough time to expand on and feel like they come out of nowhere. There is a death scene that could have been very sad if we knew the character better. The film definitely feels like set up for the next, this could be due to it being based on a book. It needed more of pay off in this film to make it feel more than just set up for the next.I liked the twists in the film, but it needed more time explaining it. Overall a decent action film but can be improved!"
" Prepare yourself for a story twist fiesta
",0.4767,0.9914,2017-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Due to all the bad reviews from people who are obviously bored in life and subjectively gave the movie 1/10, I felt an obligation to write a review and give this movie a 10/10 rating. Honestly, if this teenage trilogy doesn't deserve a good rating, which one does?If you are a person who likes to stay in their comfort zone and refuse to support any type of change, even if it is a good one, this movie ain't gonna be your cup of tea. The movie trilogy is slightly different from the books when it comes to timeline of events. Nonetheless, I've read the books before. I also felt it was necessary that Wes made some changes in the content since some scenes in the book we a little bit cliché, for example, the telepathy part etc. It doesn't change the plot of the story though. The story still makes a lot of sense and people who fail to see what the story is about should definitely try watching the movie one more time. I'm not sure what's there to be confusing or unclear.Other than that, the cast is beyond amazing. It is obvious that not only these young people are great actors, but they're also emotionally invested in this project and very passionate about it, which is quite rare to find in today's cinematography. I salute them for that.CGI is beyond satisfying for us, regular people who make 90% of the viewers and who don't watch movies just because we want to see cool effects but want to see great acting and content too. I'm not interested in discussing the finesse because CGI is not bad at all.Anyway, not to prolong this because it's obvious that I had a great time watching it in the cinema (thrice!)... if you are a fan of dystopian and post-apocalyptic movies, you will definitely love this sequel to bits.It is adventurous, mysterious and exciting to watch every time! I'm looking forward to the third sequel to see what they'll make of it, because in the end, It's not important how you start something, but how you finish it."
" Continuing blandness
",0.0,0.8897,2017-10-28 00:00:00,4,"THE SCORCH TRIALS is the second film in the MAZE RUNNER series, a series which is already outstaying its welcome thanks to the over-familiarity of the material which gives it a cookie-cutter feel. The kids from the last film have survived and escaped into a new world which turns out to be just as deadly as the last one. Expect the usual gamut of bland characterisation, an over-reliance on CGI to provide all of the landscape and action shots, and predictable twists and turns in the narrative. I enjoyed Aidan Gillen's presence here but that's about it. This is the kind of film that slips from my memory just moments after the credits roll, and the kind of film that I'll never have any interest in returning to - especially when there's so much better stuff out there."
" Just another disaster
",-0.6249,0.897,2017-10-24 00:00:00,1,"The one thing that this movie has in common with the book, is the title and that's even a stretch. The book was original, intriguing, action packed. The movie was just like hey lets just shoot at things, like that will help get the deposit back for the studio. All in all, the movie would be seen as ""decent"" as i have been told by people that have not read the books. But to those of us that have read the books, we would like to know what the director was on when he was making this movie. Was it acid, cocaine, or was it just plain ignorance? The director was have been blind if he thought this movie was going to get any kind of award for best motion picture."
" Enjoyable YA adventure that throws in everything but the kitchen sink
",0.3818,0.9745,2017-10-22 00:00:00,6,"'The Maze Runner' was a surprisingly entertaining young adult adventure with a disappointingly lame conclusion. After a good 100 minutes of finely staged set-pieces and well constructed intrigue and mystery, we were given some clunky exposition to explain what the whole story had been about in the most melodramatic and abrupt way possible in order to set-up a sequel. And this sequel, for all intents and purposes, may as well be from a different genre and film series altogether. It is so bizarrely different to its predecessor that it takes a while to reacquaint yourself with the characters and the convoluted situation the find themselves in (thanks largely to Part 1's ridiculous explanation for the maze). It's all to do with *groan* a virus that turns people into mutant zombie thingys.However, once 'The Scorch Trials' gets moving it proves itself to be just as relentlessly enjoyable as the original, sans awful ending, injecting a high-energy enthusiasm into its inventive action sequences which sees it through some problems, of which there are plenty. Part 2 is extremely weak on characterisations, relying on an audience's knowledge of the characters from a previous outing to fill in the blanks, but there wasn't much to the fresh faced cast the first time around anyway, beyond some basic personality traits and physical attributes. And then there's the plot, or lack thereof. This is essentially just one long chase across a desert with some occasional pit-stops made to help save the SFX and stunt teams some money. But the set-pieces are so well executed that whenever a plot threatens to rear its troublesome head you're almost relieved to see it smacked right back down in its place beneath all the running, jumping and escaping. This is not a franchise that does very well with plot. It does, however, do action rather well.In the seemingly endless onslaught of YA adaptations for the big screen, this is above average for the genre and stands as a fairly solid romp that chucks in just about every post-apocalyptic cliché there is, but does so with great enthusiasm and energy. It's hard to dislike a film that efficiently hits its targets, even if they are hit at extremely close range. And this time, the ending isn't abysmal."

" A fast paced PG-13 action movie
",0.0,0.9568,2017-10-05 00:00:00,7,"First of all i have to say i have not read any of the books and i absolutely hated the first part of this series. By looking at the reviews you can clearly see that everyone who has read the books and is a fan of this franchise thinks this movie was absolutely terrible, since i have not read any of the books i found it quite alright.Most importantly it is packed with action, for a kids movie like this it is one of the most detrimental factors, the makers of this are trying to show kids good life lessons and values, like friendship, integrity and bravery, very clearly this film is aimed at more younger audiences, i do not get why people are writing horrible comments about this little action flick, of course it is illogical, of course there is 0 plot and the plot twist is absolutely blatant and visible from miles away. But that is all a part of kids action movies like this, none of the main characters get seriously harmed, if people die, they die without any major bloodshed and there is no profanity, what exactly do you expect from a film like this? It is decent for what it is and its young audience.Overall, not so bad, had beautiful and creative scenery, more action, definitely a very big improvement from the first one, this will be one of those movies kids remember 20 years later and reminisce about the ''good'' movies of their childhood. Go and rewatch some of your childhood classics and judge them know, will see what i mean."

At least I was a little disappointed. At the same time, though, I think they had to make some major differences to prevent an R-rating, due to the more gory and graphic details in the book. Overall, great story-line, loved the acting and special effects. If you're looking for a movie that stays mostly true to the book, I wouldn't recommend this one. If you're just looking for a good dystopian thriller, this one's perfect!"
" A decent enough second instalment
",0.0,0.6399,2017-09-21 00:00:00,7,"After the events of 'The Maze Runner' the survivors are taken to what they are told is a waystation by a group claiming to have rescued them from the sinister 'WCKD' (Wicked) organisation. They learn that there are many others who were in different mazes and each day a few are chosen and sent on to a say location. Thomas, the protagonist of the first film, investigates the facility and makes a shocking discovery; it is run by WCKD and those who they believed had departed are being held in a comatose state for reasons that aren't immediately obvious. He also learns that there is a rebel group known as the Right Hand in the mountains. He, and the others in his dormitory break out, rescue his friend Teresa then head out into 'The Scorch'. This is the outside world; there is destruction everywhere, infected individuals who act like 'fast zombies' threaten them regularly and all the time WCKD is after them. They manage to meet up with other people but not all of them can be trusted.This is a solid enough sequel although I must admit I preferred the original film as it had a greater sense of mystery. Here there are less intriguing questions. The antagonists are nicely threatening even if calling them WCKD is a little weak; what sort of serious organisation calls itself 'Wicked'; it sounds more like a thinks-its-trendy nightclub or an alcopop wait, the latter does exist! On the plus side though there is lots of action and a real sense of danger. The 'Infected' were much scarier than anything I'd expected to see in a UK 12 certificate film. The film looked really good; the destroyed cities looked impressively real. The characters are interesting enough, as well as the survivors from the first film there are some notable additions; most obviously Janson, the chief antagonist, and Brenda and Jorge, two potential allies. Overall this is decent enough even if it is very much the middle instalment in a trilogy. Hopefully 'The Death Cure' will provide a good conclusion to the story."

What bothers me the most though is the 'performance' of Dylan O'Brian. If you watched anything else with him in it, you would realize he plays exact same character in every single movie. I know he is not the only actor who does this, but it make you think if it's really an acting or if he is just being himself or learn to act only 1 way altogether... It could possibly found its audience within the 10-15yr olds... If you are within this range you might enjoy it, otherwise I wouldn't bother..."

Truth is, its a very solid adventure movie, and more entertaining than the first one in the installment. Fast paced with a lot of nice visual effects work. Even the ending was satisfying, a good cliff hanger when the group gets split up. Must also mention John Paesanos score which adds greatly to most of the scenes. He will win an Oscar some day, no doubt. Looking forward to Death Cure."
" The Trial of Trust
",0.5106,0.9624,2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"To me, the second movie is a definite improvement. While the first film was all about confusion, constant running and spooky monsters, the second one opens the perspective on the whole post-apocalyptic world, with its tragedies and hopes. Of course, main elements of the movie are standard. Evil, wicked corporation, desert thugs and rebels, and your everyday zombies - we've seen 'em all, true. Yet it is interesting to watch, because, 1. These are kids, not some motley crew of hunters/ex cops, marines/all- knowing scientists, just kids alone in the dark, without skills, smartness or inner aggression. And 2. This is not about killing zombies or even finding cure, - bit simple escape to nowhere. And the absence of rather sickly ""real scenes"" adds up much to the positiveness of the movie.I really prefer this one to the first. Diversity of scenery is new and pleasant, the town sunk in sands looks interesting, and there is a sense, feeling of the open air. The plot is not just about ""This is the maze we need to get out so run"", but deeper - the price of cure, sacrifice or betrayal, loyalty and doubt. Barry Pepper was very good at his some 10 minutes of screen time) Haven't seen him in movies for ages) Also there is a rare touch of humanity in this movie, more than in the first. These zombie survival flicks, so immensely enjoyed by many peaceful residents, safe and protected, and yet longing for adventure, tend to concentrate on the extreme violence and gore. It is understandable, those who never experienced the world of violence and feel safe, like the patricians of the ancient Rome , demand the entertainment of blood and death. But this movie is not about zombies, it is about standing together, trusting each other, and that humanity will win)"

This was a difficult watch as the movie is well done with its pace, visuals, & likable cast; however, it deviated on a large scale in its screenplay by TS Nowlin. The premise in the novel, in my opinion, made allot more sense and it was disappointing when it was not translated. I understand filmmakers sometimes need to adjust original material to make it more appealing to the masses but in this case it was a frustrating second instalment for those fans of the Maze Runner trilogy.Now, despite being one of the many individuals that was displeased with this deviation, I still enjoyed the movie Wes Ball put together. It does its job by giving it's audience more action than the first & appropriately sets up for the conclusion in Death Cure. I am sure if Dashner had have been put on as an executive producer on this film, I think we would have seen some material more true to the novel. This did not happen but I don't believe this film merits a 1/10 rating. If you enjoyed Maze Runner (2014), you'll find this second instalment enjoyable as well."

" Maze Runner The Scorch Trials
",0.0,0.9782,2017-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. It has somewhat similar plot to some post apocalyptic movies, yet! It keeps you on the edge of your seat at all time. It has everything for every taste, emotion, action, thriller, horror, sci-fi, comedy, adventure, and more. Made me cry, laugh, happy and sad all together. The older cast members where very good obviously, but also, the younger cast members, to me, where exceptionally amazing. Well! Most of them. I loved the technical and art work of the movie. It did give me the impression of actually feeling the tensions and/or emotions, fear or joy when the characters were going through the scenes. I definitely rate this movie 10/10 on every aspect. I had only one problem while watching it and I am not sure if it was my hearing problem or with clearly hearing the dialogues in the first 20 minutes of the movie. However, the whole composition is so good that I cannot rate it anything lower than a perfect score. I look forward for the release of the next one."
" Absolutely loving this film series!
",0.6689,0.9831,2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"First of all, I've watched the first movie and I rate it 10/10. Really. I'm loving this series so far. This just hits in me the right category of the sci-fi movies. It's mysterious and adventurous. I generally do not like post-apocalyptic things and ESPECIALLY those mainstream zombies... But yeah. Zombies was the only thing why this was one star worse than first movie.But Like in the first movie, actors are brilliant! Special effects and milieu is just fascinating and stunning! I really like how this was written and directed, how things is getting forward. I haven't read the book and I'm not gonna read. And I don't personally give a s*** about illogical things in the story line; like how the world is ended up like that. Where the infection came from etc. And how much this is different from book...The movie itself is just amazing and exciting to watch and you really can feel the suspense. I really was in the edge of my seat at the end! And oh boy... I'm SO excited when I read there IS really coming another sequel in 2018; ""Maze Runner - The Death Cure"" YESS!! Can't wait it.This may not give all the answers what you basically want when watching movie, but in this case, that does not bother me. As long there is sequel(s) coming. These are meant to be watched right after another one.If you like adventure movies, combined with sci-fi and little bit mystery and action, go watch this film series! (After watching the predecessor)"
" I read the book and...
",0.0,0.8711,2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"OK, so, I read the book and the movie was almost completely off. I was really excited to see the cranks in the movie, but that didn't really happen. I was hoping to see the part when Theresa dissed Thomas, but it didn't happen. There was so much that I was looking forward to and I ended up feeling really disappointed. I'm disappointed, not because of the amazing actors, but because of the director. I kind of wanted to at least have 45 minutes of them in the place they were dropped off to from the first book, but they left quite quickly. I wanted them to really showcase the effects of the Scorch, but it looked more like a hot desert. I was pretty upset after watching it, but if they continue, I hope they can try to fix the mistakes from this movie."
