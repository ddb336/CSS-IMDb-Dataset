" Zoolander No. 2 on 4k ultra hd
",-0.296,0.5023,2021-02-02 00:00:00,7,"Rather than a memorable story, Zoolander 2 efforts to go big. Really big. The movie begins with a comically over-the-top Justin Bieber death scene. He's pumped full of so many bullets it may as well be ED-209 pulling the trigger. But the death serves a purpose in getting Zoolander back in the game and unfolding the big mystery/conspiracy he's summoned to foil. A rousing, with-gusto type of score and an effortful scope on par with a Michael Bay film sets a zealously overblown but comically tongue-in-cheek tone for the picture. Zoolander's establishing seclusion and recruitment scenes plays with a dark, brooding edge, the drama clearly manufactured but, as with everything else in the movie, tonally engaged in the movie's wheelhouse of aggressive nonsense that finds its humor in its overzealous approach. It works -- for a while. Zoolander No 2 capably mocks event cinema, Comedy, the fashion world, and itself at every turn. It's ridiculously fun, to a point. But as the movie progresses its vulnerabilities manifest, the movie slows down, and rather than a tight and fresh lampoon it slogs into murky try-hard territory that even the movie's many talents cannot salvage its second half from a nuclear meltdown into an unfunny, lethargic, and aimless morass now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on paramount pictures 4k ultra hd release November 2021"
" So Bad That It's Actually Enjoyable
",-0.2247,0.6438,2020-12-05 00:00:00,5,"The first half of this movie felt like I was watching Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson act out a Zoolander fanfic they found on Wattpad. By the end of the movie, I felt like I was experiencing a fever dream.Without giving away anything relevant to the actual plot, this movie contained everything from mpreg to Benedict Cumberbatch as a non-binary fashion model. This movie was so ridiculous that it made my head spin. That being said, I think that may be the only reason it worked. If it had been any less absurd, it would have just been cringe. They really made this movie as crazy as they possibly could, and I have to admit that I was entertained."
" Political agenda showing it's ugly head, once again, plus bonus ugliness
",-0.5423,0.5122,2020-11-11 00:00:00,4,"Seems like the only object for making this movie was to stuff it with all the possible political agenda of these days. It was like the first one, but tweaked considerably to the left.And mind you, we got a full Hillary frazzledrip theme at 49 minutes into the movie.

" It looks like you do learn something after 15 years
",0.3612,0.9691,2020-07-05 00:00:00,6,"Possible spoilers ahead.Derek is now more intelligent (or perhaps less stupid) and Hansel is more aware of other people (or less narcissistic). That's probably why this doesn't have the same charm that the first movie had. I mean, I was expecting something like ""vobacoobly"" instead of ""vocabulary"". Because their characters evolved--if we can call it that--then it's acceptable that there's a lot less funny exchanges between Derek and Hansel. A lot of the jokes are predictable as well, so it somehow spoils things.
Is this worth watching? If you're just looking to pass the time or try to find all the celebrities who are in the movie or you're not too nitpicky about details (from story to how real the locations look), then I think you'll somehow enjoy this. That's why I'm giving this 6.5 stars."
" Zoolander 2
",0.0,-0.9261,2020-06-17 00:00:00,3,"The first Zoolander movie is good fun, but many questioned if a sequel was necessary, especially coming out fifteen years, but it happened, written and directed by Razzie nominated Ben Stiller (The Cable Guy, Tropic Thunder). Basically, many pop singers, including Justin Bieber (as himself), have been assassinated, and Fashion Interpol secret agent Valentina Valencia (Penélope Cruz) examines their facial expressions in their final photographs, she believes they match ""Blue Steel"", the signature look of model Derek Zoolander (Razzie nominated Ben Stiller). A flashback reveals that Derek retired from modelling following the collapse of the Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good, resulting in the death of Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor), injuring Hansel McDonald (Razzie nominated Owen Wilson), and losing custody of his son, Derek Jr. Derek is a recluse living in ""extreme northern"" New Jersey. However, Billy Zane (as himself) delivers an invitation from the ""Queen of Haute Couture"", Alexanya Atoz (Razzie winning Kristen Wiig) to the House of Atoz fashion show. He is persuaded to return to a regular lifestyle in order to regain custody of his son. Meanwhile, in the ""uncharted Malibu territories"", Hansel is also a recluse, and Billy Zane delivers the same invitation. At the fashion show, Derek and Hansel are surprised by the changes to the fashion industry, but they agree to return for a performance on the runway. Derek and Hansel are tracked down by Valentina, who asks them to help Interpol uncover who is behind the systematic assassinations. With Valentina's help, Derek locates Derek Jr. (Cyrus Arnold) is residing at a local orphanage but is distraught by his son's obesity. Matilda's ghost asks Derek to protect their son, but Derek Jr. becomes disgruntled with his father and returns to the orphanage. After receiving an anonymous phone call, Hansel, Derek, and Valentina go to St. Peter's Basilica. At the church they meet Sting (as himself), who tells them the tale of Adam and Eve and the little-known Steve, the common ancestor of all models. Derek Jr. is the closest descendant Steve and holds the bloodline of the Fountain of Youth. Derek decides to turn to his enemy Jacobim ""Mugatu"" Moogberg (Razzie nominated Will Ferrell), who is in a high security prison, for help. But Mugatu tricks him into trading places with him so he can escape. While Derek and Valentina swim back to Rome, Hansel stows away on Mugatu's escape helicopter and infiltrates the House of Atoz. He witnesses Mugatu reuniting with Alexanya and killing fashion designer Don Atari (Kyle Mooney). Derek Jr. is imprisoned at the IncrediBALL, strapped to a sacrificial table, where Mugatu and many of the world's fashion designers want to consume his blood, believing, as a descendant of Steve, it can grant eternal youth. Derek, Hansel, and Valentina stop Mugatu, but Alexanya, who is actually Katinka Ingaborgovinananananana (Milla Jovovich) in disguise, attacks Valentina. Derek manages to stop an explosive device thrown into lava with his ""Magnum"". Sting arrives, revealing he is Hansel's father, and they, along with Derek Jr. releasing the look, ""El Niño"", successfully hurl the explosive back at Mugatu, presumably killing him. Derek Jr. forgives his father for his mother's death and Derek and Valentina confess their love for each other. Six weeks later, Derek and Hansel have returned to modelling, Derek and Valentina have a daughter named Darlene, Derek Jr. becomes a model himself, and Mugatu, having survived, is reformed. Also starring Benedict Cumberbatch as All the non-binary model, Justin Theroux as Evil DJ, Ariana Grande as Latex BDSM and Christina Hendricks as Seductress, Andy Dick as Don Atari's Posse, Alexander Skarsgård as Adam, John Malkovich as Chazz Spencer and Jerry Stiller as Maury, with cameos from Matt Lauer, Kiefer Sutherland, Susan Boyle, Lewis Hamilton as 'Old and Lame' Show Attendee, Naomi Campbell, Willie Nelson, Katy Perry, MC Hammer, Anna Wintour, Marc Jacobs, Tommy Hilfiger, Kate Moss, Mika, A$AP Rocky, Lenny Kravitz, Demi Lovato and Susan Sarandon. Stiller and Wilson are alright as the unintelligent model, Cruz is fit, Wiig is unrecognisable with her still face and has a wonderfully ridiculous dialect, Ferrell is only a secondary character, and the many recognisable faces popping up is sort of fun to spot. I will agree this has nowhere the same wit and style of the original, but there were some things about it I liked, I admit I did titter a few times, a below-average action comedy. It was nominated the Razzie, Worst Screen Combo for Ben Stiller and His BFF (Barely Funny Friend) Owen Wilson, and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Adequate!"
" Perfect movie for my hangover
",0.5719,0.6231,2020-05-07 00:00:00,6,"This was funny, up there with original with the same sort of humour and story but not quite as good. I did however watch this when I was super hungover and in that regard it was perfect. Lots of cameos again, Its outrageous and silly, and dumb, perfect when in the right mood or hungover. I mean the movie opens with Justin Bieber being assassinated and then Benedict Cumberbatch, Wow.The story follows past their prime male models Derik Zoolander and Hansel who are recruited by Interpol to investigate a conspiracy after a number of celebrities are assassinated while posing with Zoolander's signature ""Blue Steele"" look."
" Whatever the cause, it's a swing and a miss
",-0.1531,0.9861,2020-04-18 00:00:00,3,"Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are back on the runway as male models Derek Zoolander and Hansel, perhaps sporting a few extra wrinkles around the eyes. The original Zoolander was a sleeper hit, pulling a shocking number of laughs from what seemed like a very thin concept, and its delayed sequel, unfortunately, pales in comparison. Like many folllow-up efforts from the same genre (Austin Powers and The Hangover, I'm looking at you here) Zoolander 2 falls into the trap of constantly re-hashing the gags that worked the first time. Why innovate when the well's right there waiting for your return, after all? What new material it does bring to the screen is often good for a chuckle, but not deep enough to mine for richer material. Benedict Cumberbatch's gender-bending role as a competing supermodel is a great example. We get about three minutes of big laughs from the character, but then he's spent and is cast aside. Even the returning faces seem lighter and less interesting, particularly Will Ferrell's big-haired fashion mogul, Mugatu. They're propped up with sight gags and cheap one-liners, but there's no masking the lack of inspiration in their writing and performance. Humor arrives in sprinkles throughout this film, like a series of not-quite-ready pitches for an upcoming episode of SNL, but that's not good enough to make up for a bland, obvious storyline and an aimless, meandering pair of central character arcs. Pointless and under-cooked, or maybe over-cooked, considering how long it was left to incubate. Whatever the cause, it's a swing and a miss."

It was nice to see an update on the characters, while this movie contradicts the ending of Zoolander, some of the ideas are almost too far fetched even for Zoolander.... but i would recommend this movie to any comedy fan.

" Unnecessary sequel
",0.0,-0.1668,2018-12-23 00:00:00,2,"Zoolander 2 is an unnecessary sequel that's biggest problem is that it's not funny. The majority of the jokes are reused from the first one, making them predictable and unfunny. Other jokes that aren't old ones are still predictable making what should be really funny jokes unfunny. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are reliably committed and it's well filmed but other than the opening, it's not worth watching."
" Hit = 60% Miss = 40%
",-0.1531,0.0848,2018-12-15 00:00:00,6,"The storyline here seems rather secondary to the general absurdist, sadomasochistic atmosphere of the film and because of that, I nearly became fed up with it early on. Am glad I carried on watching. What got me laughing were the devastating riffs on hipster club culture and that character, who's name I can't remember, who seemed to be a kind of artist manager for Zoolander and Hansel. He was spot on as an insecure, scathing, worshipful, ironic twat and I wish the whole film would have been as nasty and funny as that character was. Alas. Benedict Cumberbatch as an annoyingly vague, haughty, ungendered model wasn't nearly as funny as I suspect Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller thought he would be - I can't stand him as an actor and anyway, he looks too gender specific to pull it off. That and few other instances where cameos were used would have been far better if an entirely new actor or actress should have been brought in who really fit the character, to bring him/her/it to life.I've never seen the first Zooland, and when I see that it was released around 9/11 I can see why. Watching films wasn't a high priority on anyone's list at that time. But this film makes me want to see it. The purists are (as always) whining that Zoolander 2 isn't as good as the first one but it piqued my interest!"

First off, Ben Stiller's now ex-wife is no longer in it, the story is flat. The kid who plays the son cant act, and I feel sorry for Will Farrel being in this, let alone anyone else.

This sequel was a flop, not much to surprise to anyone and we wonder as to why this sequel was took as long as it did.Within the film, it never recovers. Instead it runs through scrappy, mirthless set-pieces involving Zoolander trying to reconnect with his overweight son while Hansel grapples with the prospect of fathering multiple children with members of his regular orgy group (fronted by Keifer Sutherland, playing himself). A lot of cameos couldn't save this film, it is just quite not funny in the slightest. The chemistry between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson felt off as well in comparison to the original. Did not like too much the original, but that had some sort off awkward entertainment, while Zoolander 2 is just a rehash of the original and the jokes are all misses."

And it wasn't before I stumbled upon it on Netflix and decided to watch it out of having nothing better to watch.It turns out that ""Zoolander 2"", while it wasn't as funny and outstanding as the first ""Zoolander"" movie, actually turned out better than I had anticipated. There were some good laughs here and there throughout the movie.Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson do carry the movie quite nicely, just a shame that Will Ferrell didn't have a larger part in the movie.

Like the Simpsons before it became rubbish. 
Don Attri perfectly portrays the most ridiculous aspects of hipster. literally contradicting himself with each sentence. His views on equality, justice and gender are genuinely insightful and so well written.I truly do not understand why it isn't getting better reviews. But then I don't understand why some folk wear plastic union jack hats and camp out in the cold all night for the chance to tug a forelock in front of a living representation of classism.This film is brilliant.

Even attempts to parody the ridiculousness of fashion don't work, coming off as embarrassing at times.The plot tries to incorporate spy elements and even some strange ""Da Vinci Code"" cult/conspiracy, but it still doesn't work. Derek (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) are the exact same idiots from 15 years ago (which was endearing and funny back in 2001), only Derek has a son and Hansel has a family with a bizarre orgy group. So is there anything good about this movie? Justin Bieber's death is entertainingly violent, it's great to see the gorgeous Penelope Cruz again, and Benedict Cumberbatch has a ball playing a pretentious, gender-fluid model.If you love ""Zoolander"", ignore this garbage and watch the original for the millionth time.

This belated sequel tries its hardest to recreate the magic of the first film, taking the lunacy to even greater heights, but this time around the whole affair feels far too calculated, the result being way too many gags that fall flat (and far too many celebrity cameos).Owen Wilson gets a few chucklesome lines of dialogue (""By now she's just a couple of teeth"", ""She had a mouth like Chinese finger cuffs""), and the sight of the luscious Cruz in a basque is always a bonus (as is her 'sexy fighting' with Milla Jovovich), but overall this is a hugely disappointing sequel.

Zoolander 2 takes the same noughties style, post-modern, south park-esque delight in mocking everything in pop culture it can and applies it to an era which is defined by how seriously one takes oneself and the levels of offence one can exclaim to have felt for anything. For me, there are some wonderful, laugh out loud moments in this film, Benedict Cumberbatch's appearance as 'All' was one of the highlights.In fairness it didn't quite meet the levels of the last film for the quality of the jokes, but the ironically low score it got on here made up for that.

His everyman persona works at times (Night at the Museum movies, the first Meet the Parents film) and other times it doesn't (Walter Mitty, Meet the Parents sequel). However, Zoolander has a special place because of the cult aspect of the film. The first movie was quirky, original, and made excellent use of cameos and actors poking fun at themselves (David Duchovny takes special note). Zoolander 2, ick. After 15 years I would expect something better. The makers of movies that wait over a decade for sequels like this and the Anchorman sequel seem to think you can just put the character on the screen and fans will pay to see it. Both films suffer from some pretty lame writing with only sparse funny bits. The main actors hold the movie up by the sheer weight of their likeability, but its not enough. If you couldn't do it justice, just don't do it."

Derek (Stiller) has become a ""hermit crab"" recluse after a quickly-explained tragedy occurred in 2001. Likewise, Hansel (Wilson) is living a nomadic life with his 11-person harem-esque ""orgy"". There's plenty of sight gags & cameos right from the start. The film opens with a Bond-style car/foot chase through Rome, with the joke being that it's Justin Bieber and there's a criminal organisation going around killing pop stars. He's a good sport, getting shot by literally 100's of bullets! This brings Derek & Hansel to Rome to come out of their hibernation.Valentina (Cruz) from Interpol steps in to protect them/find Derek's long-lost son, Derek Jr (Arnold). She looks fantastic (@ 41) in her red leather suit and later in her swimsuit, lamenting her ""annoying, plus-size naturals"" that kept her from being a 'proper' model! After appearing in Alexanya Atoz (Wiig - looking likely what Miley Cyrus will look like in 15 years!) and Don Atari (Mooney - super annoying)'s fashion show and getting ridiculed, they uncover that Mugatu (Ferrell) is behind everything from his prison cell. It then turns into a bit of a Bond film, with a lava pit involved!If you're watching this hoping for some cerebral comedy, you're in the wrong place. There's heaps of dumb jokes (most involving mispronunciation), dozens of cameos (Zane, Sutherland, Cumerbatch, Armisen, Sarandon, Sting, Perry, Nelson, Moss, deGrasse Tyson) and plenty of Blue Steel/Magnum's from everyone - but it is, at heart, a comedy lambasting the superficiality and stupidness of modelling and fashion. Definitely not as good as the original, but whenever Stiller, Wilson & Ferrell are on screen together, there's going to be laughs.

",0.8347,0.9855,2017-12-11 00:00:00,9,"i'm writing this review because i was surprised for the low rate. i gave this movie a 9 because i find it's very very funny and well done and in some ways clever (even if deliberately stupid). in fact i think that is better than zoolander 1. i have to admit that Ben Stiller did a great job and it's humor is very funny and sarcastic and together with Owen Wilson they give the movie a very enjoyable and light vibe, ridiculizing the fashion industry and delivering many good laughs. Of course you don't expect to see a Woody Allen movie here... you have to take it for what it is. very funny"
" The most unfunny comedy i've seen in my life.
",0.4173,-0.3989,2017-11-07 00:00:00,2,How did all this well known actors agree to be in this mess! Almost unwatchable. Nothing makes sense in this script. Jokes are so forced you almost expect someone to poop himself in a second. As a consequence of all the reasons above half of the jokes(being not funny) end up being straight up offensive.
" Leave This Fashion Line On The Rack
",-0.0516,0.6855,2017-11-01 00:00:00,4,"(Flash Review)I just didn't really care at all about this while watching it. The only time I was drawn in with interest, aside from a brief smattering of light gags, was the final third when Will Ferrell entered the movie. He breathed a little life into this choppy movie with messy screenplay. Ferrell was not enough to rescue it from its forgettable story littered with poorly done products placements that failed to be funny or woven smoothly into the script. I couldn't get into the plot as I've already forgot itif I ever really knew it. Aside from Ferrell, the next most amusing part was the stereotypical parody of a hipster. It was a glossy production that needed a second pass on the script and better focus. I still give it credit for taking a fairly unique comedic approach."
" Lots of cameos and brain-dead silliness, but nowhere near enough laughs to fulfill its awkward script
",-0.2363,0.992,2017-10-17 00:00:00,3,"Ben Stiller's Derek Zoolander has returned, but he is nowhere as funny as the goofy fashion model we saw back in 2001, and neither are the actors who are left adrift in this comedic wasteland. 'Zoolander' is a popular film tat gradually gained a cult following for its clever, yet zany comedic energy and its ability to push the envelop. None of these are present here, and the floundering results of what transpires from Stiller and Justin Theoraux's script is a hot mess of a movie that fails to justify why a sequel was even remotely necessary. Ben Stiller and his co-star Owen Wilson have proved their comedic prestige numerous of times in the past. Just take a look back at the former in his role in the Hollywood satire 'Tropic Thunder'. It even makes it more disconcerting as to why these laugh-out-loud veterans let themselves drown in a sea where laughs are scarce and the gut-busting substance from its predecessor is left absent. Stiller reprises his role as Derek Zoolander, the former fashion model who has fallen from grace after his children's center is destroyed in an explosion that kills his wife Matilda (played by Christine Taylor) and his son (played by Cyrus Arnold) is taken away by Child Protection Services. When all hope seems lost, Zoolander is recruited by Billy Zane (playing himself) on a mission to Rome to take down the evil mastermind Mugatu (played by Will Ferrell) who has assassinated a large number of celebrities suited as secret agents. Reuniting with his best friend Hansel (played by Owen Wilson) who has resided with a family in Egypt, Zoolander must join forces with sexy central intelligence agent Valentina (played by Penelope Cruz) on a mission to bring down Mugatu, and possibly get his son back. This movie holds a large roster of celebrity cameos including Justin Bieber who bursts on screen in the extravagant opening action sequence, Katy Perry, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Tommy Hilfiger, Christina Hendricks, Kiefer Sutherland, and many, many others that are nearly impossible to remember. If that is not enough, perhaps I should mention Benedict Cumberbatch playing a transgender that gets treated to off-color jokes that hold the capacity to either to leave audiences chuckling or rolling their eyes. Aside from it feeling awkward and out of place, it is just an example of how this film believes that flashing popular show star on screen is somehow must to equate for laughs. Here's the sad news: it doesn't. It only becomes more of a tactic to distract us from the lack of laughs that pervade throughout the picture. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are left confined in the restraints of a script that fails to allow them to provide good jokes and limits to them to spewing countless one- liners, with only a fraction of them actually being laugh-worthy. Although the two are subject a genuinely funny moment or two, the rest of time sees the duo rehashing on run-of-the-mill silliness that might have been funny twenty years ago. And the subplot involving the titular character trying to rekindle his relationship with his son never sports any substance as opposed to the film which pushed the envelop with its politically-charged plot involving the assassination of the Malaysian prime minister. This movie is just too interested to playing things safe. Will Ferrell never delivers any bright moments nor does Penelope Cruz who is given relatively nothing to do other than serve as sex appeal which would have been more acceptable if she was actually funny. Zoolander 2 is not the comedic adventure we deserve nor does it justify why a follow-up to its 2001 cult classic was needed. Unfunny and depriving the charm of its predecessor, this movie is a hot mess that only spares evidence that the original film would have been better off as a stand-alone hit. Some sequels to comedy hits hit the right mark, but they come rarely and this movie is not one of them."
" I would rate it below zero if i could
",0.0,-0.7987,2017-09-16 00:00:00,1,"This is horrendous. The entire movie was so messy and atrocious.I didn't even know what exactly they were talking about the whole HOUR I sat there watching, trying my best not to get consumed by anger. I'm glad to see the rating did not go above 5. I legitimately walked out an hour after sitting there and getting my mind tortured by this piece of sh*t."
" Just loved the over-the-top comedy, whereas I typically don't
",0.7506,0.9893,2017-09-07 00:00:00,10,"I have to say that this movie really took me by surprise. Not 'surprise' as in it wasn't predictable (because it was pretty predictable, lol), but 'surprise' as in I was surprised at how enjoyable and sincere the over-the-top comedy elements were. Usually when I watch an over-the-top comedy, it makes me roll my eyes; but the over-the-top comedy elements in this movie had me genuinely laughing and enjoying the movie from start to finish. These guys aren't out to make you think deeply about life, they are just trying to make you laugh!"
" If you liked the first, you're gone love this one.
",0.7906,0.6573,2017-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Its one of those movies, you like it or you hate it. If you like the first one, like I did, there is a reasonable chance you love this one as well. I think the bad rating and reviews for this second one are a related to it wrong timing. The first one was, as many movies are, a product of its time. Back then it was funny to see the fashion world ridicule it self in a most outrages way. So its no surprise this one picks it up where they left off in the first one, and take it one or two steps further, something I loved but it increases the love/ hate factor as well. If this one was made 3 years after the first, it was probably better received. Its a movie that is just entertainment, noting more, if you can put on that filter, you will enjoy it, if you put on any other filter, there is so many things to hate about it. Again there is a convoy of celebrities making cameo's and some of them are very entertaining, seeing Ariana Grande in a SM outfit will raise more then a eyebrow and seeing Justin Bieber blown to smithereens for more then a minute by a hail of bullets, I am still looking for a GIF At the end when ask why Bieber had to die ? Mugatu's answer was epic !"
" How awkward to watch
",-0.1531,-0.7585,2017-08-11 00:00:00,2,"Wacky and non senses cult film. The main guy Zoolander is the main character from Night of the Museum, I assume he is very famous in Hollywood (maybe?) , because there is a bunch of Hollywood celebrities cameos. Yet forgive me, I am not any of their fan or hater, so even the dead of Justin Bieber is meaningless to me. The movie just really really creepy, making no senses at all, so awkward to watch. Plot is empty and meaningless, some good reviews said this movie is an irony art to the fashion world? Sorry, I am not in the fashion industry. Normal people watch movie for fun, not exaggerated absurd, that is over and abrupt. I laughed none at all, so frowned upon to these lepers."
" I think it works as a sequel.
",0.0,0.9217,2017-07-17 00:00:00,7,I actually enjoyed seeing all the characters again together. I'm a big fan of sequels bringing back most of the main characters. I found the jokes funny and laughed quite a bit during this movie. It is tough to make sequels in these days. The internet is full of trolls that just like to talk down about everything. I feel this movie deserves to have a decent rating. I get what Ben Stiller was trying to do and I feel he accomplished that. I don't think it was as good as the first one. But definitely deserves a thumbs up and an A for effort.
" Really, Really, Ridiculously Bad
",-0.7914,-0.5314,2017-07-12 00:00:00,2,"Many have asked for Zoolander 2. It's a sequel that took longer to make than Anchorman, and was perhaps even more anticipated. Stiller kept it in the works for more than a decade, writing countless versions. 15 years later, long past the selling point of comedies starring Stiller, Wilson and even Will Ferrel, Zoolander 2 surfaced. Folks, it's a disaster. It's out of touch and painful to watch. I genuinely chucked here and there, but that's no excuse. You can't put out a film 15 years later that is this horrible. The absurdity of the first one was new enough for the film to grow it's following. This one takes it to a level nobody asked for. Yes, you can make something too absurd to be funny. It's attempts to be hip and current are cringe inducing. Zoolander rides an Uber, and says words like ""hashtag"". Throughout the film, there are seemingly endless cameos. I mean, never- ending cameos. A free-for-all for Hollywood and the fashion industry, and they are all wasted... minus Benedict Cumberbatch who disappears into a unique character named ""All"". Hint to Stiller and Co., you don't mention the name of a celebrity while cameoing them in a film. ""HEY IT'S (fill in the blank)!"". Unless you're on The Muppet Show, that never works."
" I must have watched a different film
",0.0,0.9914,2017-06-21 00:00:00,7,"I remember the first time I watched the original 'Zoolander.' It was on opening night and the cinema was only about a quarter full. I found the film hilarious and laughed so much that people started staring at me. It was about then that I became aware that I was the ONLY person laughing at all. Now, in filmic hindsight it appears that most people did actually like the first film (obviously just not the people who happened to watch it with me). However, just like the first one has finally been appreciated, it's the general consensus that the – belated – sequel (imaginatively titled 'Zoolander 2') is one of the worst films ever and therefore justifiably bombed at the Box Office. I didn't get round to watching it in the cinema and, because of the overwhelmingly negative reviews, waited a couple of years until I accidentally found it on a streaming service that I paid for monthly. And, now I've seen it, I'm actually glad I did.It continues the exploits of male fashion model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and what happened since the last time he saved the world. Basically, the evil fashion mastermind he thwarted last time (think old school Bond villain, but with crazier hair – Will Ferrell) is back to destroy the foundation of society once more. Yes, it's one of the most stupid films ever made. Just like the first one. Yes, it satirises the fashion industry. Just like the first one did. And, yes, there are a few jokes that maybe aren't quite as funny as they were supposed to be. Just like the first one. In short, it's more of the same and I can't really see where all the hate has gone. Yes, belated sequels don't normally do well (think 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Basic Instinct'), so maybe that has something to do with it. And I guess Ben Stiller's star has faded a little since his late nineties/early 2000s heyday. However, I just simply can't understand the – mass – hate.If you prefer following a hero with an IQ in double digits then I can see how Derek Zoolander may be perceived as annoying, yet he's no worse than in the first outing. Plus this time they make more of his friends and family. And there's a load of new celebrity cameos related to pop culture and the fashion world – again, like the first one.Basically, I can see people not liking 'Zoolander 2,' but only if this kind of 'dumb' humour isn't your thing. However, seeing as the first was – apparently – successful and (to me, anyway) this seems like a perfect follow on, I can't see what there is to complain about if you enjoyed the original. Perhaps I like it more because of the way I watched it, i.e. not paying full price for a cinema ticket and having my expectations suitably lowered by the many negative reviews? I would say that it'll never be as original as the original (but then how many sequels are?!), but if you enjoyed the first then, as long as you're not expecting some sort of major game-changing piece that reinvents cinema all together, then it's definitely worth an hour and a half of your time if you enjoyed the first and can see it using an already paid-for package."
" Not good
",-0.3412,-0.4509,2017-05-20 00:00:00,3,Zoolander (2001) is a smart movie about dumb and successful people. This movie is just a dumb movie about dumb people. It just poorly copies the original. Nearly every joke falls flat. Ben stiller seems to become more and more lazy. He has made zero effort in making this movie.
" Funny
",0.4404,0.9755,2017-05-01 00:00:00,9,"I'm surprised by this film's low rating. I found it thoroughly entertaining.You have to have seen the original and be of a certain age to get the jokes, and I'm glad I watched it at home to replay some dialogues I'd have missed in a cinema. The cameos are weighty, these are not trivial people, and in most cases very self-deprecatory (kudos to them for that), the script is funny, at times laugh-aloud funny, the locations are beautiful, the pace is balanced, the cinematography is excellent, and the directing is solid.If you recognise the phrase ""I see you've sent my letters back, and my LP records and they're all scratched"", if you can grasp unsubtle sexual references without being scandalised, and if you like pop-culture references, you'll enjoy this film."
" Listen to your friend Billy Zane, he's a cool dude!
",0.6996,0.8225,2017-04-30 00:00:00,7,"I am baffled at the hate for this cleverly written, filled with celebrity cameos, well-paced, and most-of-all funny sequel to the 2001's Zoolander. Watched it once before reading the IMDb reviews and then a second time to see if I was living in a comedy bubble of denial,laughing out loud many times on each viewing. Many hilarious new characters update the return of Derek and Hansel to the catwalk including an agent of Interpol's Global Fashion Division, gorgeous Penelope Cruz. The only non-returning character I missed was Maury Ballstein, played by Jerry Stiller, who was probably doing a stretch in solitary confinement in Fashion Prison. Billy Zane, again, was right."

If you take this film too seriously you won't find it funny. Relax. Though and it's seriously Hilarious"

" Painful
",-0.4404,-0.9889,2017-03-18 00:00:00,1,"Imagine if an internet troll made a movie and you sat down to watch it. That's this movie. Harrowing. The one glimmer of amusement was Cumberbatch's performance. But the only thing that saved that was the force of the actor's acting. The film itself verged on sickening, because again and again it invited a viewer to laugh at people for the crassest reasons. For this reason, it was like taking into public that embarrassing relative who will blurt the most cringe-worthy things trying to be clever, and they're the only one to laugh, and you just stand there dying inside. That's this movie. Even if you have no love for Bieber, and I don't, watching what they do to the kid called my own schadenfreude into account. And the later quip about it is an abysmal, below-the-belt cheap shot in the vein of Mike Myers lampooning the famous cosmetic surgeon who afterwards did himself in. This film should be recategorized as a horror movie because it gets you to stop laughing fast and you're left feeling terrified they'll make another like it. Then you're angry and have to leave a review somewhere to absolve yourself of even watching such a creepy stink-pile. Watching some abandoned kid get mocked, exploited, and abused IS NOT FUNNY, especially in light of the pedophile investigations in the UK, and the really freaky and ill scandals here in the US. The vanity and narcissism in adults that can and do destroy kids IS NOT FUNNY. What hurts even more is when you see names and faces you might want to see, like Sting and Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson, and they're all spouting inappropriate one-liners. What an abuse of talent. You end up just feeling dumped on by the whole industry. And exploited at the box office."
" Painfully awful
",-0.7506,-0.9259,2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"I saw this movie w/ my friends for someones birthday, and it was the most painful thing I've ever witnessed. The director probably thought ""lets just throw a bunch of celebs into a crappy movie that has Ben Stiller doing zoolander crap and boom!"" Freaking awful movie, do NOT recommend anyone see this..."
" So Funny! shout outs to the 90s movie at every turn!
",0.5827,0.9111,2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe this movie has a low rating! I guess that just shows how subjective peoples' sense of humor can be. There are so many great call backs to the 90s movie that I loved! The stuff Zoolander and Handel say are just hysterical. Will Ferrell is the funniest movie villain of all time. My favorite line: ""I'm leaving modeling to live as a hermit crab."""
" A pretty good sequel
",0.7269,0.9868,2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"I think they did a good job with this sequel. Creating a sequel to Zoolander had to be tough to write, I mean how many jokes can you make about dumb models? Some of the plot gets a little hairy , but basically it's about Zoolander getting his son back, and Hansel finding his father, who turns out to be Sting. This movie definitely has more action than the first, with a sort of James Bond tone to it. All in all, I enjoyed, and I laughed. I can say that I loved the first one, especially the gas station scene, that was brilliant comedy, but this movie does have it's funny moments, like when Sting calls Hansel disguising his voice and coding his words into all names of Police songs."
" #pants and not even #sexypants.
",0.0,-0.4068,2017-01-03 00:00:00,2,"Ben Stiller returns 15 years on to play the outrageously stupid yet beautiful Derek Zoolander. A lot can happen in 15 years and it certainly has in the fashion world, with an introduction that skims what's gone since saving the Malaysian Prime Minister. Marriage, child, destruction, death, there's so much, it lays a weak foundation for the plot. But seriously, what do we expected? It's stiller doing his comical, borderline spoof style that seems like it's written by Austin Powers himself. Zoolander is roped into yet another sinister ploy to discover who the ""chosen one"" is and to why celebrities across the world and being killed off. Zoolander is reunited with Hansel, Owen Wilson who just plays the same damn character he does in literally ever movie. I don't dislike him, but it's nothing different from the norm. Ferrell returns also, just more intense and angry than before, but he literally saves the film, but not alone. Cyrus Arnold plays Derek Jr. Zoolander's estranged son who was taken into care when he was a baby. He appears to be the best actor out of the lot, which is impressive, especially knowing that Stiller can actually act.And what is it with Penélope Cuz's agent or decision to star in such films recently, first Grimsby and now this. Personally, she doesn't woo me over like she does with other viewers and I don't actually rate her performances either, she actually becomes an immediate turn-off for a film, especially since Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Like the first, there's a long line of A-lister cameos throughout the film from the movie, music and fashion industry that'll make you go ""no way"" and mostly ask why and how!? It's nonstop, almost making the film feel just like a string of cameo bits put together. It just gets annoying really fast and it almost hurt when I saw people I actually admire. The first was just stupid, this one, or two, is just even stupider.It's offensive without being funny, which makes it bad comedy. But I can see some people finding it funny, maybe even hilarious but that's obviously a difference of having a sense of humour and having a good sense of humour, no offence to Zoolander fans (Only joking! Maybe, but if you can't see the funny side of this, then I prove my mocking point!) #pants and not even #sexypants.
