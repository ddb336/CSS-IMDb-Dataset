",0.658,-0.9585,2020-12-22 00:00:00,7,"Muscles.
He did convince in this film, the action scenes cliche but he pulled it off. I thought of I Am Sam (and others) ...pretty damn impressive character range. Saddled here with a chick he had about as much chemistry with as zero (and her acting was atrocious) and JB doing a mysterious turn. Not sure what the hell he was even doing in this film. The script was very bad, narrative awful, so basically all my stars are for Sean."
" A movie that would have been mediocre 30 years ago
",0.0,0.9866,2020-11-20 00:00:00,5,"You can see that the script is old because it uses none of the technology we are not accustomed to, but also because of the attitudes of the characters. The cliches that were the norm in the 90s are alive and well in this film. So what is there left to see? Is Sean Penn fantastic as an action hero? Not really. He looks great for his age, but he's old. Does the story hold up to the test of time? No, because you've seen it all before and much better done. Do you really care that actors like Javier Bardem, Ray Winstone, Mark Rylance and Idris Elba are in it? Absolutely not, because they have episodic roles and have been added to the roster just to inflate audiences without providing any additional value to the film. Plus there are some scenes, like the Claymore and the bull ones, that are completely cartoonish!Bottom line: an average action film, with an obsolete script and a misleading cast. Avoid this."

They even staged a bullfight sequence in Barcelona despite the high profile ban on bullfighting in the region since 2010. This movie wants to be a serious action movie, honestly it leaves me asking how do films like this get made?"

Javier Bardem's role is so small and a waste of his talents.There are people out there to kill Sean penn, they keep watching him but not kill him even if he is walking alone at late night.

On the plus side, the cast are good with Penn solid in the lead and fun support from Rylance, Winstone, Bardem and Elba - watch Bardem's face when Penn looks at his ex girlfriend of 8 years - what acting."
" ""Whatever's in season, I just need to shoot something.""
",-0.34,0.9765,2019-12-19 00:00:00,7,"What detracts from the credibilty of the story is that an assassin like Jim Terrier (Sean Penn) would return to the scene of a crime, even if it was eight years after killing the mining minister of the Congo. Why even put yourself in that kind of position? So it wasn't unusual that someone from his former contract team would be on the make to clean up all traces of the past. What I didn't expect to see here was a ripped Sean Penn sporting a bodybuilder's physique on an almost sixty year old frame. When did that all transpire? Not that it couldn't happen, but I've never seen him in a role with that kind of body before. Good for him I guess.The beginning of the story had a ""Blood Diamond"" feel to it, but it didn't approach the hostile gunfights and brutal combat of that earlier film. It did have it's share for the action fan, and it would have been cool if Javier Bardem could have stuck around a while longer to provide a more compelling romantic rival for the attention of Jasmine Trinca's Annie character. The same could be said for Idris Elba as Interpol Agent Barnes, surreptitiously aiding Terrier's quest. I also liked Ray Winstone in the role of Terrier's friend Stanley. Seemed like all the interesting characters got rubbed out quite precipitously. The IMDb rating of 5.8 as I write this seems a little low, but then again it's a somewhat clich√©d story in an exotic setting. Check it out for Sean Penn's muscles if nothing else."

" The Gunman (2015)
",0.0,0.0129,2019-09-03 00:00:00,4,"Directed by Pierre Morel. Starring Sean Penn, Javier Bardem, Jasmine Trinca, Mark Rylance, Ray Winstone, Idris Elba, Peter Franz√©n, Billy Billingham, Ade Oyefoso. (R)Dour, hackneyed actioner with Penn as a mercenary posing as an NGO worker called upon to carry out an assassination; several years later, those sins come for payment in the form of hit squads looking to clean up the messes of vaguely corrupt, powerful forces. Set in a similarly swampy moral climate as director Morel's ""Taken""--shady international geo-politics in place of sex trafficking rings--this is an unusual vanity project for its star (and co-writer/co-producer), transforming Penn into a mirthless, middle-aged action hero who can barely muster any enthusiasm when taking down the bad guys. Too undistinguished and trope-heavy to engage as a thriller with weight; the action too infrequent and shoddily-edited to rate as empty escapism. Bardem does his eccentric malefactor schtick again, but he's miles away from ""Skyfall"" territory (to say nothing for ""No Country for Old Men""). At least the guy who broke into stardom playing Jeff Spicoli gets to briefly surf.39/100"

" Strenuous Yet Lazy
",-0.3612,-0.965,2019-07-21 00:00:00,2,"This film seems to a combo Sean Penn vanity / testosterone trope project. It's insultingly stupid & witless. High production values, globe-trotting locations, & a cast of thousands. Marquee names including Javier Bardem & Idris Elba are criminally wasted. Maybe they roped Penn into this awful mess by appealing to his do-gooder side, I don't know. (That and a suitcase of money, surely.) The international theft of natural resources! A humanitarian crisis in the Congo! Corruption! Shadowy operatives straight out of central casting! The smiliest guy is the most evil guy! A low IQ hero with a convenient brain injury! A no-basis love interest, who - despite being a mature doctor - is totally useless, has the inexplicable name of ""Annie"", & is shamelessly referred to as ""the/a GIRL!"" Running! Shooting! Lots of phone calls & texts! Really bright fake blood! And OMG a BULLFIGHT! Squeeeeee!!!I usually don't invest a lot of negative emotion into movies. Even when I think they suck, others might find them worthy, entertaining, or whatever. But I'm making an exception for ""The Gunman."" I really hated this film."

the message being about corporations doing shady stuff to take advantage of underdeveloped countries. a few things were really dumb like, it seemed that the only point to his post concussion syndrome was that he wrote down his friends address in a book that he dropped, and that's how the bad guys found him. the whole movie they made him seem like a super covert agent so it would have been stupid if he would've done something like write an address down. So it seems almost like they had to come up with a reason for it. Also the main villain ended up being killed by a bull at the bull Toro show, but in order for that to happen, about five specific things had to happen for the bull to escape, over the last five minutes before he died. That one was very obvious and ridiculous"

So good he has to atone for his sins by joining green peace. After an attempt is made on his life the rest of the plot unfolds as liberal talking points disguised as characters get knocked of one by one. Every big enemy in this film is a greedy capitalist pig who made their living by exploiting native Africans. White man bad (except for Penn and one buddy) and they all deserve to die for things they did that more than likely don't happen except in the fever dreams of Bernie Sanders.Have said all that, the covert stuff, and action is rather well done.

--Sean Penn prove that even browned-off sick of the whole deal chain-smokers can have magnificently chiseled arms and delts, which I half-suspect were CGI.
--Sean Penn surf, ie, standing on an actual board.Oh, well, I supposed we believed it when Greg Brady did it.
--Sean Penn quickly start an admittedly beautiful Italian classic car which has been sitting idle in a barn for years, the story goes. Anyone who can get a brand new Italian car started is a feat of luck and mechanical nouse, let alone a 1962 model in a barn.Perhaps his Captain America-grade muscular arms helped with the crank handle.
--Sean Penn demonstrate that Africa is all screwed up because of wicked intriguing, and surgical assassinations, by the ruthless diabolical Capitalist West , of decent good-guy African politicians who were just about to nobly divert the continent's wealth for the good of its long-suffering impoverished locals when they were cut down by, well, Sean Penn, with a long-range sniper rifle.... same Schtick as Clooney in Syriana...meshing nicely with each chaps' naive SJW politics and world view.
I knew there had to be a reason why I'd never heard of this 2015 movie with pretty good cast until it came on as the TV late show last Saturday night.Lucky I recorded it and could FFWD the commercials, because even by itself it is far too long.I can understand the Spanish bulls getting mad and goring people getting both typecast and dragged into this crapola."

",0.5423,-0.3612,2019-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Sean Penn has been known as a brilliant writer/director/producer, and some of his acting has been top notch as well. ""The Gunman"" stakes a claim as a riveting suspense thrill ride from start to finish. It is engaging with it's complex plot and well written characters.The storyboard revolves around a man (Penn) who is a mercenary/Special Forces/sniper who is tasked with a job in the Congo, but is forced to leave the continent when completed and go into hiding. Some time later (Penn) returns to the Congo under humanitarian circumstances but is immediately hunted for the assassination and is forced to go into hiding again and find out who and why.
I feel this is a relatively powerful storyline that circumvents action, suspense-thriller. The action sequences are done decently and there are some good fight scenes as well. I though Penn did a fabulous job as writer/director/producer and star. This film will keep you invested for the running time."

However a hit squad has been sent to kill him and he is also suffering from a serious illness that destabilizes him.Terrier doggedly tries to stay alive and find the person who is out to get him while reconnecting with his old flame.With Penn in the cast, the film wants to make a serious point about exploitation of third world countries by greedy corporations.

Then out of the blue some well organized guys want to kill him. He returns to Europe in an attempt to find out who is behind this.

Jim is handicapped by post concussion syndrome and is instructed to stay away from ""rough sport, loud concerts, and East End pubs."" He has memory problems so he writes everything down. He also has mood swings etc.Our protagonist can no longer be a super spy as I think Matt Damon has set the bar too high. Now the latest gimmick is that they have to be handicapped and only be able to use half their brain, half the time. The fact that this didn't work well with ""Dying of the Light"" didn't deter ACE et al to make us another menatlly handicapped hero, who really was a corporate assassin, which some people see as a bad guy. The scruffy looking Sean Penn, who never combed his hair, and loved by Annie, didn't fare any better than Nicolas Cage. The action consisted mostly of the typical filmdom gun play of the ""gang that couldn't shoot straight"" against the protagonist.

It's a pretty standard-type action flick - lots of chases and shootouts and explosions and killings, etc., etc. In other words it's not really anything we haven;t seen before. This one stars Sean Penn as Jim Terrier. He's some sort of private security guy supporting working with NGOs in Africa, but also working secretly for mining companies whose only goal is to make as much money off the continent's minerals as possible. As part of the job Jim has to assassinate the Mining Minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and from that point on he's a wanted man - being sought basically by the mining companies, who want to kill him to make sure no one finds out what they did. And from the point of the assassination on the movie is basically one gigantic chase.I have to confess that this kind of action movie really isn't really my thing. It seemed to have a decent cast (Javier Barden and Idris Elba were names I knew well) so I thought I'd give it a chance, but I really wasn't very impressed. The story's a bit convoluted and has a few too many unnecessary lot twists - like Terrier's brain injury (apparently caused by being around too many explosions.) It's not one I'd put on my ""watch again"" list. (3/10)"

A contrived and unbelievable plot has some attention-grabbing action but nothing of narrative interest happens, we don't care about his survival - and there is nothing to write home about.

It starts in the Congo, at first I thought Sean Penn was an aid worker but turns out he's an assassin, hired to by some big company to take out the minister of mining so that that company can make the big $$$. The successful kill shot sends Penn into hiding without a word to his lover. 8 years later someone starts taking out the assignation team, he goes on a global chase to figure out who.This (tries) to have a bit of a Jason Bourne feel, with government conspiracy, Interpol, who can I trust and some very decent/competent fight & action scenes. Its also another vehicle for an over 50 action star.On that note Sean Penn is in fantastic shape, like really ripped with zero body fat, showcased with multiple shirtless scenes however as the movie goes on it's too much, like half the movie he is shirtless or sleeveless, showing his abs or just plain naked. It became a bit of a joke actually as the very serious political thriller story is overshadowed by the star's physique.The (unrequited) love story is nothing new, with his lady love (Jasmine Trinca), just another hapless damsel in distress role but I liked it. Javier Bardem is a sleazy, drunk, jealous character, Idris Elba is just hot... I think he worked for Interpol, didn't care just wish he had been on screen more. Worth checking out."
" Some Random Review about a missed rather Random Movie
",-0.296,0.9993,2018-03-02 00:00:00,4,".:Not a native English speaker:.
After having seen the Movie for the first time after years of ignoring it, i finally gave in and bought myself the Film as Blu Ray, as for the shallow reason of the Cover and mention of Congo. When i first heard of the Movie it was said to be a possible Franchise starter and Sean Penn's take on the Old man taking back whats his, Taken/96 Hours formula. Boy was i on a ride of awkward disappointment of not having any expectations at all. When i bought the film it took about two months until i popped in the Disc and take on a ride where i never would have thought to speak this out loud, on what was an inconsistent near fatal mess with some rare great moments. Before i get to what was for me the personal, but undercooked highlight, i am going to talk about what on paper (depends on how you stand on Penn's political views, i guess) seems like a sure Win. The Cast surely is great, you have 6 great Actors forming the main protagonists consisting of Sean Penn, who has surely some great scenes and moments, Javier Bardem who again plays a great role as some kind of an ex best friend and colleague, Jasmine Trinca, who also plays her role really good and brings some interesting moments (even if there are few), Ray Winstone who, well he is Ray Winstone and has some fun dialogue to, even if his role is a bit of a cliche, Idris Elba which has some good acting but rather forgetable scenes (to be exact, a day passed since i saw the Movie and i cant remember any of his scenes), & Mark Rylance, who might be a great actor but in this Movie he has an awkward way of taling in a calm and rather quiet voice which makes especially later on an essential scene really awkward (Confrontation scene between him and Penn's character). The Film has some great Cinematography and beautiful colors from start to finish, especially the scenes that play in Spain and Congo. There are some cool Action scenes but some of them feel forced taked on the film, as for the reason of their context being rather, lets just say bizzare. Now to what where the two personal highlights that also show the two weakest links in the Film. The first is that the Film deals with the Political climate and corruption of the Congo, which sadly is of rare bread in our World, especially in Movies/TV Shows/Video Games. The film doesn't delve far enough into that field in my gusto, which makes the whole point or glue that holds the plot together more or less shallow. The second highlight and shortcoming is The Love Story, Love triangle between Penn, Bardem and Trinca, this is exacly the part where i thought and told a friend of that Film something like this ""I never ever would have thought that i would see a Movie where the Love Story is far more interesting than the Action parts of this Action Thriller flick"". I would watch in a heartbeat if there would be some form of reinterpretation of this Film with an emphasis on the Love part (im sure there already exists this Movie in some capacity), the personal surprise for me is that normally i do not like romantic Movies (with rare exceptions), but here it presented itself with best, most dramatic and engaging story of this lost opportunity. It deals with grief, broken promises, broken friendship, redemption, loss, giving up, anger and more.
I guarantee you that most of you will agree with me. To be fair, one of the Action scenes that is the best and most inventive i have seen in a long time was after a tragedy that occurs after a dramatic firefight of emotions, which results into an actual firefight, to spoil as little as possible, it is a scene involving a shower, a Burning house and how to escape it the best way while being hunted by mercenary's. So long story short, half arsed mess with some exceptional parts that get drown by its weight"
" action Penn
",0.0,0.882,2017-10-14 00:00:00,4,"It's 2006. The Democratic Republic of Congo is on the verge as factions fight over mineral rights. Jim Terrier (Sean Penn) is having a fling with NGO doctor Annie and is part of a private security team. Government Minister cancels mining contracts and they are hired to assassinate the Minister. Felix (Javier Bardem) is their murky boss. Jim fires the kill shot and flees the Congo leaving Annie behind. Eight years later, Jim is back in the Congo doing humanitarian work. Gunmen attack his work site.I don't understand why he would go back to the Congo. It's a simple thing for him to do humanitarian work somewhere else and be attacked. There's no skin off the script. There is a social justice aspect to this action thriller but it mostly leans towards action thriller. It makes it less authentic and Penn is no action hero. It simply doesn't work being caught between the fun action genre and the serious message thriller genre. It still could have worked if he stayed in the Congo trying to protect his humanitarian work from various gunmen. Instead, he's globetrotting and this turns into a romantic melodrama. The middle falls into a slow muddle. I don't know what this is trying to be but it doesn't work."
" Watch the first 10 minutes skip to the end
",0.0,0.3818,2017-06-04 00:00:00,2,"Then watch the last 10 minutes if you have to. Saved you 2 hours of your life.Terrible, even Mark Rylance was poor. How did this get made and with such top end actors. I love all these actors normally, especially Penn (MILK and many more) It is predictable and laboured, poor script..."
" Sean Penn's Rebranding Snafu
",-0.5423,-0.7754,2017-04-10 00:00:00,4,"It seems odd that such a talented actor as Sean Penn would require an action star rebranding but I guess that this was that attempt. And oh boy did it fail.This movie is a snoozefest. It contains a convoluted plot, poor dialogue, and (mostly) bland action scenes. This movie's 1 hour & 55 minutes and you painfully feel every second of them. It's shot fine and it has one or two good action scenes but none of that can make up for how forgettable this movie is. I found it on Netflix and saw it starred Penn, Idris Elba, Javier Bardem, and Mark Rylance and figured that this movie would at least be decent. Not even these great actors can help this film.About a forgettable of an action movie as I can think of. Not a recommend."
