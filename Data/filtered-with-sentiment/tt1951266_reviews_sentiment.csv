" Unwatchable
",0.0,0.3612,2021-03-28 00:00:00,1,All the money and big names you could ever want squandered on a storyline that teetered out in the first or second movie.Everything about this movie is wrong.You can visibly see the actors - all of them - struggle to maintain enthusiasm for each scene. So if they didn't want to be making it - why would you want to be watching it?
" Mockingjay - Part 2 leaves the bunker that housed its characters in the first part to transform the Capital into the public arena that enshrined the franchise
",0.0,0.999,2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"Mockingjay - Part 2 then leaves the bunker that housed its characters in the first part to transform the Capital into the public arena that enshrined the franchise. The director Francis Lawrence uses this structure in a guerrilla context, yielding good and punctual action scenes. The director also knows how to take advantage of city spaces (on the surface and below it), coordinating depth and time (pause and speed) to create sequences of calculated tension. Francis Lawrence, again, was not carried away by ""the more the better"". Instead of a festival of uninterrupted action sequences, one larger than the other, the director introduces us to a lengthy rhythm that does, but does not depend on it for the fluency of the narrative. The film takes place in rubble and underground, as if it were a phase of an average infinite racing game. If we stop to think, there is only one frantic moment in Hollywood style in the whole work, when the beasties attack the group in the capital's sewers, a sequence directed with a clinical eye by Lawrence who, with the editing work of Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa, is shaky, fast, violent, exciting, but without losing sight of the characters and the humanity of his actions.In addition, the director again makes good use of the dark photography and the gray unfiltered color palette of Jo Willems (who has worked on the series since Catching Fire) that he introduced more strongly in the previous film continues and is accentuated in Part 2 part, marking the worsening of the war and conditions in the various districts. With that, the fatalistic feeling permeates the whole tape, making evident the anti-warming message of Collins' narrative. It is worth commenting here on the composition of the execution sequence, as the director seems to work in partnership with Willems in order to emulate Leni Riefensthal in The Triumph of the Will, with all the heavy meaning and perfectly within the concept of the film it carries. There is the monumentality of open-plan photography, the tall, solid and geometric structures populating the surroundings, the perfect framing of the action, divided into mill metrically symmetrical quadrants and, of course, the uniforms of all the officers present. This is, without a doubt, a time to be contemplated.Another element that helps in the focus that this film has is the soundtrack by James Newton Howard who, despite not bringing any particularly significant composition, has his work precisely synchronized in the film, avoiding the maneuver of the viewer's feelings. Quite the contrary, Francis Lawrence uses instrumental music to amplify the tension at the right times, without over-wiring what lies ahead. Visual effects also evolved at a rapid pace, something natural for a film franchise that started without much certainty of its success and that gradually gained budgets increasingly larger (The two parts of Mockingjay cost about US $ 160 million). Comparing the creatures in computer graphics in this last part with those we see at the end of the original film is more than enough to show the evolution in this regard. But the same goes for the digital construction of the Capital, which is one of the protagonists of this final war, gaining notorious veracity and the feeling of ""lived space"" that was so lacking in its previous versions.The allegory of the plot is unfortunately current, with the theater of war set up by Snow and Coin being a media show, adequately described by Finnick as a new edition of The Hunger Games. Even the death of some soldiers is announced by the capital with the same fanfare as the Games. Between the plot of political manipulation and the televised battle, the film comes up against its love triangle. Protocol from the beginning, the relationship between Katniss, Peeta and Gale ended up underutilizing the development of the male characters (in addition to taking time from other interesting assistants), culminating in an embarrassing scene in which the suitors discuss the relationship while their loved one pretends to sleep. Katniss, however, has always seemed as uninterested in the novel as in political matters. This disenchantment governs her final attitudes, in a martyrdom that does not materialize, but makes clear the weight carried by the character.
Something that can be frustrating for many viewers is the fact that we see very little of the battle between the Capital and the District Alliance. Although Squadron 451 (a little subtle but very effective reference to the book ""Fahrenheit 451"", by Ray Bradbury) is made up of elite warriors, the group is only there for propaganda purposes, serving as familiar faces to be seen in an area of war. And that makes sense, because ""The Hunger Games"" was never about war, but about Katniss. The young woman never asked to become a symbol of resistance or a martyr to the revolution. Her involvement in Panem's policy started in a personal way, with her attempt to save her sister's life, Prim (Willow Shields), and it is great that her intentions remain so, especially in her final act.In this last part, the director was understandably complex and he preferred to focus on the nerve points: Katniss-Peeta relationship and the game of disinformation. It worked, but it leaves the feeling of some wasted opportunities, such as the characters of Julianne Moore and Donald Sutherland, two great actors clearly enjoying themselves in their respective roles, but without having enough space to chew on the sets with their seniority. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died during the filming, is also present, in his latest role, with some digital inserts of his effigy, but which do not hinder the unfolding of the story or the immersion of the audience. He would play an important role in ending the saga, but that part had not been recorded and was added to Alma Coin's lines.Jennifer Lawrence remains precise in her complicated role as a reluctant heroine, maneuvered by everything and everyone, but she finds Josh Hutcherson, finally showing what he came for, his direct competition. The actor manages to pass on to the viewer the anguish of Peeta Mellark, controlled by President Snow with the intention of murdering Katniss, the character shows the film in a suffocating internal conflict that is transmitted brilliantly by his interpreter. The supporting cast is one of the best that Hollywood has ever put together in a production. We have the always great Woody Harrelson, a sensational performance by the master Donald Sutherland and the great Sam Claflin, Elizabeth Banks and Jena Malone.The potential of the important feminist discourse that the work carries is again evident, whether from Katniss herself - who in her utopian universe is driven and encouraged by the men around her, and not diminished - or by the prominent and powerful figures of President Alma Coin, Lieutenant Jackson, Commander Lyme (Gwendoline Christie, unfortunately underutilized) and Commander Paylor, the latter who finally has a small but important role in closing the story. Meanwhile, men, be it the love interests of Katniss, Peeta and Gale, their allies, Haymitch, Finnick and Boggs, and even President Snow, are portrayed without much depth and personality, serving merely as means and ends in the pursuit of protagonist for justice and equality against the inhumane autocracy where he lives.However, as in Part One, albeit on a smaller scale, it is possible to feel the weight of dividing the third book into two features of more than two hours each. Although Katniss and his team are thrown into the fire very quickly and the action unfolds efficiently to an explosive climax, the fact is that the various false endings, which stretch the plot too much, break the pace of the story told. The need to please the legion of loyal readers and the desire to make a tape clearly more epic, took away some of the freedom of the screenwriters, who literally transposed every moment after the effective closing of the narrative as if it were a literary work. However, justice is done: the production manages to be efficient enough until it shows fatigue which, in turn, with goodwill, it is perfectly possible to gloss over as a necessary evil and leave it at that.Every journey has its end, The Hunger Games has opened the way for other adaptations of other books and his latest film was worthy to close his cycle. Admirers of the literary work need not be concerned about the film's fidelity to the books. Despite being based on a children's book, 'Part 2' is a dark and violent film. Even if it takes place in a dystopian future, it is impressive how the story traces modern and current political criticism. The Hunger Games is one of the best and most serious juvenile sagas that leaves in addition to an interesting legacy the opening for possible future chapters (Why not explore the war that divided Panem between the Capital and other districts?). In any case, Katniss Everdeen receives an end worthy of her dark history, mature and scarred as her own. Her heroism may have been accidental, but her aim and heart have always been essentially accurate and admirable."

Gave it a 3 because it was visually great aside from the jack rabbit that holds the camera the entire time. I wish the internet had a filter for the other votes made by bots or the meek. Wish I had not bought the collection on Apple TV otherwise I would have not forced myself to sit through all 5 films. Glad I only spent 20 bucks, wish it were less..."

I enjoyed that it follows the book, but I do wish they would have added more screen time to the actual fighting. More time for grieving over dead characters and more depth and character growth. It felt a little glossed over, like ""Here's Katniss, Here's the rebellion. Now Here's your ending."" Where's the heartfelt moments that grab your attention or the crazy action scenes? I did like the over all message of the movie, about how corrupt people at the top of society are and how they will go to any lengths to gain or keep power. A solid ending, to the series, following the books, but the movie lacks a little."

I feel like these two films wanted to do what Harry Potter 7 1/2 did and make it a two parter. Only difference is that HP had enough important material to make it a two parter, while this feels like it's only for the hype. It only really starts taking off around the end. It was certainly better than part 1 though."

" PRRIIIIIMMM!!!
",0.0,0.971,2020-10-26 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand why my nephews don't like this one. It's almost as much of a trip in to the games as the first two. I also wish they'd quit their jibber-jabber while it's on, but you can't have everything.I like the way this film wraps up the story. It's saved some of the best bits to last and you still don't know who Katniss might end up with, if at all, until one of the many endings (Like Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King, there's lots of bits tied up, even after you're sure that it's finished).The actors all do there jobs well, the special effects are on point and the sets, direction, etc are all good.
Congratulations to Suzanne Collins for coming up with such a great tale, even if it is a bit worrying that this could be our future. The world is that kind of scary at the moment that I wouldn't be surprised.If I had to criticise anything, it would be that they've squeezed a lot in to this one and it seems a bit rushed, but I can understand why they cut the last one off at the point that they did. Perhaps in the future, they will make a TV series, that might elaborate on things in a more well paced way.I'm a bit sad I've finished the quadrilogy to be honest, but I'm still looking forward to the journey again, when I finally get around to reading them."

It became annoying at every point.
First of all no girl falls in love because a guy was nice to her. Why did Katniss marry Peter and not Gale, is it because Gale didn't protect her sister? Peter should have been killed while on her fruitless mission but strangely they didn't kill him even after he killed their one of their men.

" 'Victory' at a Price - 'there are worse games to play""
",-0.1779,-0.999,2020-07-28 00:00:00,9,"Katniss has now seen what Snow has done to Peeta - brainwashed and ready to attack her at every opportunity, he is dangerous, not only to Katniss but himself. She realises now that she has grown to love him through all of the horrific events since they were picked as District 12 Tributes. Even though Gale helped 'rescue' Peeta, his relationship with Katniss grows tenuous. Meanwhile the leader of the Rebels - Alma Coin - is pushing to 'use' Katniss to further her own goals. Katniss now wants Snow dead - and steps up to be the 'Mockingjay' - the symbol of the Rebellion - as Coin & Plutarch have always wanted her too. Prim is also now heavily involved - trained as a nurse for the inevitable casualties of the battles ahead. Gale has also grown more ruthless in his attitude - Katniss overhears him speaking with Beetee about a tactic - use an explosion to suck in the enemy to help the injured and dying - then a delayed action explosive takes out the whole lot. Katniss, disgusted by the immorality, drifts even further from Gale. She goes to District 2 where the Rebels have failed to take a stronghold called 'The Nut'. After agreeing to seal it by bombing the only exits it becomes apparent that the Capitol's tactics are wrong - thousands now trapped are forced to surrender and, as Katniss is about to deliver a speech, a trainload of survivors appears. The rebels are wary and demand they disarm - one points a gun at Katniss, who passionately implores him to 'stop killing for him (Snow)' before he fires. Katniss is only saved by her armour but is now convinced that killing Snow is the only way to bring the war to an end. Confiding in Johanna, who agrees to cover for her during the wedding of Finnick, she heads toward the capitol. Once there she is almost immediately recognised and runs into Gale. She is introduced to 'her' squad - who have been instructed to make propo-vids of the warzone but behind the front lines. Boggs warns Katniss that she needs to be careful as she is becoming as bigger threat to Coin as Snow. As they wait she is alarmed to see Peeta, now in combat gear, being dropped as part of the Team. A chain of events now unfolds as President Snow has laid intensive 'Pods' - lethal traps' to hold up the advance. Even now, with victory for the rebels a reality, they are about to play another 'Hunger Games'....
Very quickly they encounter traps and Boggs is killed but Katniss now tries to break through to Snow's Mansion, the squad systematically losing members while underground. Finally, Katniss and Gale head towards Snow's Mansion, along with thousands of refugees that the President has promised sanctuary to. As they approach the rebels begin attacking and gale is captured and dragged away by Peacekeepers. As this is unfolding a hovercraft bearing Capitol logos flies low overhead and drops hundreds of little pods on parachutes - people reached for them and then they explode. Katniss is stunned and looks towards the screaming mass of wounded and dead and spots her Sister Prim. She suddenly remembers the 'delayed' explosion tactic that Gale spoke of - she screams a warning to Prim - just as there is a second explosion - which kills Prim and flings a burning and unconscious Katniss to the edge of the blast-zone. She awakes to be told by her Mother that Prim is dead. Once recovered, Katniss goes to see the now incarcerated President Snow, in his Rose Conservatory. She is stunned to hear Snow deny that he had anything to do with the bombs - in fact a brilliant stroke by Coin - his Peacekeepers turned against him and the Mansion fell without a fight. Katniss, still reeling, now realises that she has one more decision to make. After a very short and final meeting with Gale, Katniss is summoned to a meeting with Coin and the other surviving tributes to discuss Coin's proposal of holding another victory 'Hunger Games' - this time with the Capitol's children. Beetee rejects it outright but Johanna and Enobaria are for it. The casting votes are left with Katniss and Haymitch. When Katniss agrees to the Games Haymitch joins her, but he senses there is more to this decision. On the day it has been decided that Katniss will execute Snow with her arrows. Coin gives a speech and asks that 'your aim be as true as your heart is pure'. Katniss, knowing that Coin is the one who took her Sister from her, let's fly, hitting Coin in the chest. Snow bursts into laughter as the crowd surges forward in their hate to see him dead. Katniss tries to take poison but Peeta stops her. Later, Haymitch reads a letter from Plutarch which shows that he understood why she did this - and that a pardon will be arranged. Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch have nothing left now but to go 'home' to a deserted and totally destroyed District 12.
'Mockingjay Part 2' concludes the saga of Katniss Everdeen and does so in a melancholy way. After all the sacrifice and effort, Katniss still lost her Sister and many others - Rue, Finnick, Cinna and even, in a certain way, Gale. Now she only has Peeta and they are both finished - traumatised, mentally damaged and lost. Her only lasting legacy is the 'victory' by the Districts won at dreadful cost.
The Epilogue show her and Peeta with their children several years later in the very field that we see in the opening of the first film. Katniss is singing the sad lullaby that we first heard at the very beginning of the first 'Hunger Games' when she sang it to Prim -'Deep in the meadow'...yes, there are worse games to play.
Even at the end this Film has no 'happy ending' - at best it is bittersweet, perhaps even melancholy, it is however a fitting end for a girl who has performed 'heroically'. She has learned not to trust anyone, she has lost her Sister and many friends and still she holds on to the hope that, at least Peeta and her Children will remain free from what has gone before - she deserves her peace, however long that should last.
I find the 'Hunger Games' series to be the most realistic, affecting and heart-rending of all the Young Adult Franchises. It doesn't patronise the audience, it doesn't take the easy route and certainly shows what a brutal place the world can be. There are NO 'superheroes' here, only ordinary folk having to fight for their freedom - and paying the Price for doing so. The production is beautifully crafted and the Actors, especially in this final instalment, are superb - they LOOK war-weary and sad. A lot of people said that they 'liked' the first two films but not the Mockingjay pair, which shows they do not understand what the Author was actually trying to say.
A special mention should also be made of the absolutely wonderful scores through ALL of these Films by James Newton Howard, accompanying the unfolding Drama with memorable themes that remain with the viewer - 'Rue's Farewell', 'The Hanging Tree' and 'There are worse games to play' from this final film.
Now, especially in 2020, these Films remain a timely warning to the young - and indeed all of us - of what can happen when a society loses its soul."
" The hunger games: Mockingjay- part 2
",-0.25,0.6721,2020-07-22 00:00:00,8,"I always saw The Hunger Games' movies as a thrilling representation of the corruption and tyranny that's invading this world, and as a young Egyptian who lived through two recent revolutions, we know a great deal about the consequences of civil war, and how dirty the fight can be over political power. This movie hits right home with this theme in a way that democratic and luxurious societies won't understand or enjoy.Mockingjay pt2 delivers a suspenseful and emotional ride as Katniss and the other rebels set out on a mission to kill the ruthless president Snow. The film plays heavy on its politics, showing the ugly side of revolutions. It would have been easy to make a pure good vs. pure evil scenario, but the movie shows a lot of gray areas and stresses on the fact the no one is incorruptible, which is far more enjoyable in terms of storytelling.The film also does justice to its characters in their final journey, and has great performances by its two leads. J.Lawrence excels in portraying a determined Katniss fighting to subdue her tortured emotions for the sake of a bigger cause, she perfectly balances the strength of making sacrifices and becoming merciless in war without losing her humanity. Hutcherson gives his best acting shot as a confused Peeta fighting battles both on the ground and within his mind, and his monologues arrive with several meaningful moments that remind us of what 'The Hunger Games' were all about. However, its D.Sutherland's and J.Moore's sickening performances as two similar nemeses, that elevated this young-adult film to a whole new level."

There was so much useless filler and dialog that it was obvious it was done purely as a cash grab and for no other reason.

" Slow, thoughtful, nihilistic and utterly depressing gut punch.
",-0.0754,-0.9941,2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"Considering the ""intended audience"", I never expected to like these movies. I was utterly wrong... I'm reviewing both parts here because they are same story just split in two.Catching fire tried really hard to be something different, and special movie on it's own right and didn't get there. But it didn't need to, because it was very obviously just lead up to this final.I guess everybody expected series like this to go out in a typical hollywood grande finale; as action packed thriller with heroes coming out on top.Instead, Mockingjay is slow, thoughtful, nihilistic and utterly depressing gut punch. Brutally honest movie about the realities of human society. I really didn't guess Hollywood could produce a big budget movie like this these days. Especially in this genre, and it really wouldn't work the same if it wasn't.These movies have so many sides that could be written about, so I only pick out one:I expected Katniss to be your typical young adult heroine... Instead being honest dephtful character that only becomes more apparent further the story goes. First glance I thought her coldness and sudden hits of weakness was just poor writing. But shes teenage girl, who's constantly pushed and forced to do everything she does throughout story.She doesn't want any of it and appears cruel and cold, understanding that she is, which makes her hate herself as well as the outside world for it. Knowing that she has to be, she still wants and tries to be good. Finally she goes on to just take her revenge come hell or high water.It goes as you'd expect such endeavour to go in real world. Events pushing her in to a full Travis Bickle mode in the end. She never recovers, eventually learning she can't but live her life, taking herself and world around her as they are.It's tragic story of young people pushed to adulthood by aggression and violence. It's realistic depiction. Not just entertaining hollywood action.The final movie drives home all the other themes as well. World is unfair and chaotic and we rarely can do anything about it. But that doesn't mean things we do don't matter.I have to say Hunger Games might be one the most important scifi stories of 21st century. It's strange people haven't catched that yet, but I'm sure they will in the future."
" Terrible finale.
",-0.4767,0.3723,2020-06-05 00:00:00,3,"A terrible and predictable end to a series which had a good potential. Jennifer's role gets very irritating at this point that it's unwatchable and unbearable. What a waste. If you are reading this just watch the first movie of the series, may the second one as well but leave out the rest and pretend the series ended that way and you will be happy."
" Super bleak
",0.5994,-0.7009,2020-06-03 00:00:00,7,"This film is very depressing. It has a lot of the world and intrigue of the previous films, but not as much hope and emotion. It felt like a real war film and there were no winners."
" Terribly written but still half decent
",-0.3182,-0.8842,2020-05-27 00:00:00,4,"After the second movie it was extremely obvious that the movies are based on books for young adults - lots of attention to relationships, lots of ""coming of age"" moments, many glossed-over elements that were not deemed essential to the plot. The first two movies were still great although some of it was rather predictable but the last two movies ........ yeaaaah, no.For starters, the writing becomes incredibly sloppy. You're not watching a classic here - predictable pop-corny tag lines, an even more annoying focus on relationships, sob time every 20 minutes. If done well, it could work but Katniss really becomes a ""girl perfect"" who goes from a crying broken girl to ""moment of epiphany"" girl, then gives an amazing speech and somehow gets everyone's support. It got tired after movie two, we're now at movie 4 and even some of the in-movie characters get sick of it. Especially since they use this trick half a dozen times in these last two movies.Then there's the plot elements which basically consist of ""Katniss refuses to listen to anyone even if it means the deaths of lots of people"" but somehow the movie never makes it clear exactly how egotistical she is.It's not helped that the tactics of the ""Capitol"" are completely baffling - having the most amazing technologies at their disposal, they use it like they did in the first two movies: as if it's all a game, turning it on or off for suspense as if the whole world was still watching it all on TV. It. Makes. No. Sense. Proper use of these weapons would have killed Katniss and company a dozen times over.In the end, it reads like fan fiction. Poorly thought out, sloppily written and it never gets smart, never gets deep.Except the end. The end is what saves the movie somewhat after over an hour and a half of dross. It still makes for a half decent movie but don't expect the quality of the first two movies."
" Remember the good things
",0.4404,0.9844,2020-05-26 00:00:00,7,"Part two of a movie based on one book still a huge failure in ever adaptation. The problem stems from greed, but I don't think it ruins the two movies entirely.
The film series as a whole I think got progressively worse. The first movie caught my attention and the dystopian would was interesting and the story was compelling. By this movie the story was harder to follow and the world was not as compelling.
The main problem with this movie is that it dragged I keeper wondering when it was going to end. Katniss's rebel forces marching through the city was entertaining, but in the end it undid what the whole movie was building to. This is a problem that most likely could have gone away if it was only one movie.
Though over arching story of both movies was great. Katniss is rescued by the rebellion she becomes propaganda for the rebels. The rebels unite the country and prepare for civil war, and fall into the trap of rescuing the victors (which is a weak point in the story, from the previous movie). Continuing onto the next movie all of our main characters end up on the ground of the battle to film propaganda again, here you is the faults of Coin really start to become apparent to the audience. Katniss takes charge and leads them on a mission to kill Snow. Most of the crew dies, most importantly Finick. They reach the president mansion to be meet with the bombs of Coin. ( A surprising twist, could have been better in one movie). Katniss realizes Coins vault and assassinates her and the people mob snow. She losses her reputation, but ends tyranny for now. She goes into exile and finds peace at home and starts a family with Peeta.
She ended up with Peeta, which is what I expect after he survived the first movie. It probably have worked better if Gale died, instead she just dismissed him with a bye and that was the last we saw of him. The side characters all got side lined with the payoff from the last movie. It was all good, but would have fit better in one movie.
Katniss's arc of always being under someone as a pawn was payed off well with her taking charge.
There was multiple scenes of Katniss just walking, which dragged.
Overall the movie was well acted, was emotional at the parts that we supposed too. I felt that the movie dragged and the strong elements of story telling form the previous movies was not as prevalent. Though it gave a sweet conclusion to the story and watching the fall of an oppressive government fall thanks to the story's hero is always rewarding to watch. It could have been better, but what came out was still good."

This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but I have seen many movies. This movie can be ranked first, mainly because I have expectations for this movie. You can choose not to watch, this movie is really not non-watching."
" The most overrated film series ever?
",0.0,-0.4939,2020-05-03 00:00:00,4,"The first movie was ok, second good even, but three and four was shambolic. I never read the books, but either their as bad or the author should go after those who made these films in court."
" A bad ending, compared to the other films.
",-0.5423,0.9964,2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,"This film is the fourth and final adaptation of the literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and brings to the cinema the second half of the last book. I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film.In this film, Katniss decides to go beyond what is asked of her by the Resistance. They wanted a mascot, someone to pose and advertise their cause. She decides to take the initiative, be at the front and take part in the decisive battle for control of the Capital. She wants to kill Snow. On the other hand, she fears Peeta's mental health, after he has been rescued from the hands of the dictator. After all, he still suffers with the marks of torture and deep brainwashing he suffered.It is difficult to describe what I felt when I finished watching this film. This tetralogy was one of the most tasty and interesting that I have seen in cinema in many years. Loaded with an epic sense, a sweet scent of adventure, good action scenes and touches of social criticism, the story is very good and definitely worth it. All three previous films were able to take advantage of this and give us the best. It is true that the previous film did not seem so good, but I did not expect the disaster that this film came to be! Compared to the others, it seems made by amateurs and confirms that the idea of dividing the final book into two films was terrible. This film simply had little to tell us other than the final assault on the Capital, which should have been the final and culminating half of a third and final film. But pulling money out of the public and making them pay sounds better, and the movie industry has to bill, so let's make two films for the silly viewers to pay a little more and the studio to make a few extra million dollars.The cast remained at the same level as the previous films. If this film failed, it was not the actors' fault, but the director, Francis Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence has remained excellent, but does not bring anything new. Katniss continues to look hot in war and cold in love. Donald Sutherland was excellent, although he went a little too far in his madness and seems to be really crazy in some scenes. Julianne Moore, who gave life to President Coin, turns out to be a pleasant surprise in that she is not quite what she appears, but this turnaround was to be expected by the way the film prepared it. Josh Hutcherson continues to do a decent job, but not pleasant to me. All the other actors, who had more or less opportunities to give an air of value and talent in the previous films, practically disappear.The film is loaded with scenes of a lot of action, explosions and shots. If everything seems real, thanks to excellent sound effects and first-rate CGI, the same cannot be said of all the costumes. Peacekeepers, for example, look like Star Wars imperial soldiers. A careful cinematography with good contrast, excellent sets and very realistic fights, along with an excellent soundtrack, complete the production values.A lot of action, explosions and shots, good actors doing the best they know, but without material to work on a film that has very little story to tell... this is how we can sum up this film, which was certainly a disappointment for many who they had enjoyed the previous films."
" I like this film very much, but one character almost ruins the plot
",-0.394,0.0396,2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"I am not a fan way out there sci-fi stories with fictionalised cars and planes etc...I like to keep my films close to reality. However despite this I like this film very much. The lead actress carries the whole film and indeed the whole series of films, she is excellent. The story-line is fictional, however the main theory about a big elite power group is now emerging, so the basic lline of the film is well worth consideration for future generations. One of my main gripes is the character of Gale Hawthorne. The actor who plays him cannot act to save his life, his character is completely anachronistic and his character development is absolutely ludicrous, from poor, simple coalface miner to some kind of crack top elite forces leader of troops is so unreal and utterly unbelieveable. The character is so out of place it is as though someone else wrote his script and dropped his character in from afar. Despite Gale's character being idiotic and the acting much the same I rte this film 9/10"

" Excellent end to a great series!
",0.8439,-0.9833,2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,I felt that this was an excellent finale for the series. Katniss is a young woman who has trouble getting past the horrors of the first 2 games. She suffers throughout this movie with nightmares and relives those hurtful memories throughout the movie. She has to make tough choices to protect the ones she loves. Not every decision she makes is right or the best but who ever makes the best decisions 100% of the time. Her selfishness to kill Snow puts many close to her in danger and even leaves some dead trying to protect her. She unknowingly sows the seeds for a massive civil war just by wanting to help others. The cost weighed heavily on Katniss and in my opinion was right to question the methods used to eventually take district 2 among other events. She could have easily tipped the scales to pure violence but holds on to her morals and uses the power she has over others to try and make better choices. The end was heartbreaking as prim along with many other innocent bystanders including children were killed in the middle of the conflict. If that isn't enough to show how horrible war is then I honestly don't know what would. This series imho could not have ended better.

Yes this movie got me disappointed. A misleading hug mistake film production at the ending scene. When Katniss Everdeen didn't complete the objective by killing president Alma coin instead of Snow. When she got the chance. I didn't expect that coming. I will not recommend and stop at the first half of Mockingjay or Catching fire. Spoiler alert she didn't kill Snow

" Explosive finale!
",0.0,0.8337,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Although the ending is a little weak, the build-up is exciting and it's fun getting there. Almost every moment is edge of your seat excitement and despite its dark tone they still managed to throw some humor in every once in a while. Even the fearsome President Snow has a few zingers. Donald Sutherland was the perfect choice for Snow, and it shows here more than any of the other films. Every word sounds a chill down your spine and you hate him like you should hate all good villains. It is slow at times and some scenes serve no purpose other than to drag out the runtime. But for the most part the movie is exciting and that's what matters. It's an (almost) perfect ending to the Hunger Games franchise.

In fact, I actually enjoyed these films! I thought the acting wasn't too bad and even tho they do make the character of gale less likeable I still liked him. They didn't really do great with the deaths. They should have focused more in finnek. The end with gale is not what happens in the book. I did enjoy it and if you're a fan of the hunger games then I would give it a go."

I'm not comparing it to the books, because no book-movie is perfect, and this movie does include the ""cliff notes"" of the story. I just think that the focus of the movie was backwards.there's a lot of leading up to the big events of the story with no pay-off. it's like they focus on the swelling action, but the defining plot points are just brushed over. Katniss and the rebellion finally show up to the capital, but she gets nocked unconscious and we as the audience miss the whole war/conflict..? Prim dies and it's not a huge part of the movie...?? Katniss says goodbye to Gale, but there's only one dialog about her decision and it's honestly pretty vague... the movie sums up the resolution of the whole story with a couple scenes of dialog and a letter from Annie in the last 20 mins....?this movie was all teasing and the end barely answer your questions."
" BEST BOOK SERIES/MOVIES EVER! 😍😍😍
",0.7371,0.9715,2020-01-27 00:00:00,10,"Even after all this years I'm reading the books again. Since I never even read the third book, only first two but after finally buying them all instead of borrowing them I started reading them and watching the movies after finishing a book or before starting it. So I could compare them. All can I say that the movies are mostly accurate to the books and that's surprising considering how a lot of people like to change movies. For example Twilight is so much different than the first book. I probably have never enjoyed another universe as The Hunger Games that much (Not even The Maze Runner or Divergent) and finally now when I'm older I understand everything better. All the movies brought such a feels to my heart, especially last two and despite everyone hating on them I liked them a lot. They made me cry a lot and I wish the fandom would be still alive. I'm excited that there will be a new book coming out this year thought. And I'm so happy that I have books which I can re-read again and again and movies which I can watch again and again and never get bored from. I'm so sad that there is no more game on play store thought (The Hunger Games Adventures) because it was my favourite and I wanted to play it again since never even finished it."

But I was bored and they were streaming so I'd figure I'd watch them to see what all the fuss was about.The first one, while not a great movie, was decent enough that made me want to see the second. And while I didn't feel it was as good as the first, sheer bloody mindedness made me finish it and honestly I was bored silly throughout Mockingjay. That's both parts one and two.I had hoped that there would be more action, a big finish, something to really bring this series home but all I got was the heroine moping about, walking, obvious people dying and a really obvious ending.The first is the best of the bunch and it just goes downhill from there,"

It was dull and dark from the beginning and didn't know what was going on; they didn't even show us them going into the Capitol. The plot could've been better, especially towards the end where I expected Katniss to be fighting in the Capitol, not avoiding death again. The action scenes were ok, however it was a bit confusing which members of unit 451 got killed because they didn't show them get killed clearly or show their faces. What didn't help was my stream kept buffering and I had to switch streams, which wasn't pleasant and made me miss or not understand a few things that were said, but the movie still wouldn't have been a more enjoyable experience."

The problems of this saga are the same for all the chapters: if the universe described is interesting (especially for the cruel, but not so innovative, idea of death games), the way how the characters act in it is or plate and dishumanized, or with more pathos than the necessary, that makes the scenes overfull and annoying. Moreover, the revolution plot, argument of these final two movies, is followed without any kind of psychological insensitivity and the exchange of goods with bads and vice-versa is not deeply felt by the spectator. Like the previous chapters, this final Hunger Games, that resolve superficially (because superficially was characterized) the triangle of love in favour of Peeta, reveals that all the saga is just a sufficient action and dystopian movie, overrated, and obeys to a lot of commercial aims, like the same dystopian (banal) world, the female heroine and the division of the final episode in two parts (typical of the first half of 10s years, cfr. Harry Potter and Twilight)."

-Lawrence and Hutcherson
-the music
-cinematography
-action/thriller elements
-great endingBut some glaring problems kept this movie from being a 10. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a good movie but here are some flaws that are hard to overlook:
-random, pointless side characters introduced only to die
-plot holes, for instance Peeta joining Katniss's group in the capital
-too quick of a buildup to the finale
-slow start to the filmI will say though, the last 10 minutes of this movie is easily worth it and really cements the trilogy. Like I said, it's not a bad movie, but it's a good movie with flaws.

We a dystopia, criticizing modern issues of course, and not the future, as any dystopia or eutopia (and not utopia). And we see a hero! As always. What about the rest of people living there? And how more sexist can it get (meant spoiler), the ending? The hero -and a few more characters- can do a big success , like a revolution. But what about the rest? We can't all be big success, otherwise no one would be. This is a competitive view on society, and most stories are based on this, as well as a ""villain"" who makes the protagonist ""the good guy"" for no apparent reason: they good guys don't seem to make any big choices: they were just born in this world and (violently) fight for their lives. It also glorifies violence to some extent. And how can a story (action or not) be without all these? It can, and I have read it.

" A faithful adaptation of an awful book is still awful
",-0.4767,-0.9789,2019-04-20 00:00:00,3,"I loved most of the books. One of the best series ever in my opinion. Except for the last few chapters which were the worst chapters i've had the misfortune to read from any modern series.
I can confidently say that this movie adapts these chapters faithfully without much deviation from the source material.
160 million dollars were spent on this.
Why.The acting felt stilted and lame, but that might have been due to all the characters canonically being depressed wrecks at this point in the series. Which doesn't make for a very enjoyable experience.The plot had comparatively little action for the culmination of a series about a revolution. I'm afraid to say this is possibly the one point where the movie strayed from the path laid out by the book. And for the worse. Instead of elaborate tactical suspense and serious discussion and weighty combat, we are treated to facile standoffs quick flashes of action and loads and loads of talking about inane things. Worse still, with the dialogue being mostly melodramatic there weren't many character moments to make up for all this either.And the ending? Without giving away anything, possibly the worst twists i have ever seen or read, all in one place. Nonsensical, nothing really resolved.
I reserve ratings of 3 and below for movies that teach such bad lessons that they might have a negative impact IRL. The ending here and the behavior of the main characters qualifies for this. Just straight up dumb stuff that i suspect Suzanne Collins just put in to make things more gritty or grounded so as to not have too plain an ending. This is the one point where i wish the movie franchise had just straight up discarded her ideas for being just nonsensical in the context of the rest of the story.An utterly shameful conclusion to an otherwise great trilogy, to some extent due to the need to stretch this into another movie, to some extent because of the ineptness of the storyboard writers, but mostly because of the choice to stay very close to the source material and the original author having a fit of lunacy writing this part or something."

But as a team Glade supporter, this ending of the whole story is pretty close to a worst case scenario.
Gale was pretended to be the man for Katniss in the beginning. So after Katniss helped her sister out after she was selected to the Hunger Games she met Peter. But Gale stayed in the discrit with Prim and Katniss' mother and looked after them. So later when he met Katniss again, he really seemed to be hurt, because he felt that Katniss has generated strong feelings for Petaa.
So in the end he's like the guilty one for Prims dead and Katniss just let him down and is starting a Family with Petaa. Thats so heartbreaking!!!"

They actually make the beautiful Elizabeth Banks revolting to the point that it takes away from what movie there is actually to watch. Only reason I didn't give it a 0/10 was because Jennifer Lawrence does is pretty good Takashi imitation. I'd rather watch Battle Royale and Battle Royale II a hundred times that watch this again.

This is largely due to the source material: the books (I've read them) are just not that good. The most interesting thing in them was the premise--the competition among the impoverished sectors--and the farther the books got away from that, the less interesting they became, as the author was better with plot than with character and not at all skilled in writing dialogue with wit or philosophical depth. The first ""Hunger Games"" was very good: it emphasized the game; it highlighted differences among the participants; it retained the book's smart ending. Sparkling performances in both small and large supporting roles backed Jennifer Lawrence's luminescent performance in the lead. The 'Catching Fire' sequel was also pretty good, with extra kudos for the special effects. But by the time we get to ""Mockingjay""--which must have been split into two movies only to maximize profits--there's not much going on. Particularly in ""Mockingjay Part 2,"" it was sad to watch such an outstanding cast of actors try to make something of a script that gives none of them anything interesting to do or say while they plod on to a predictable ending. All Lawrence can do is look angst-ridden. The few plot developments present are forced and unconvincing. I'll give it a ""3"" only for the continuing high quality of special effects and artwork. The only reason to watch it is if you feel obligated to complete the saga."

It isn't long before the Mockingjay ""goes rogue"" as the film pays homage to Orwell if I recall by high school book reports. What is important in this film is that the end does not leave you hanging, you have closure.I enjoyed the film as Katniss spouted out memorable lines as all civilian killing is personal. They are our family. Philip Seymour Hoffman died while making this film. His role was reduced to a few head shots and limit lines. I heard they were going to use CG to create his character.

" A load of nonsense.
",-0.4019,-0.9846,2018-03-26 00:00:00,3,"For my review of these two movies, I'm going to be treating them as one movie and copy/pasting this review onto both movies. The only reason why this movie was split into two is because the studio wanted to make money. There is no other logical reason for this nonsense. Plot - This movie isn't very interesting or compelling. The first half is all filler while the second half is a series of semi-violent sequences of poorly choreographed action in between more boring filler. For the most part these movie are very predictable. Anything that is unpredictable is only made so due to the level of stupidity involved. I'm not sure if I can stress enough how much of this movie is boring filler. Characters - None of the actors really care anymore. The guy who plays Haymitch is still enjoyable, but he's a minor character. The characters are all as boring and idiotic and simplistic as they always were.Cinematography - The whole look of this movie is just as bad as the previous movies, but at some points its even worse. There isn't really anything to say about this movie. Its just a load of boring, predictable nonsense."
" Contemporary fiction into film
",0.0,0.9923,2018-03-04 00:00:00,9,"It's depressing to me that most of the reviews for this movie show a general ignorance about what the books they're based on are really about, especially considering that they were written for a young adult audience (and so aren't particularly complicated in plot). The films were blockbuster films, which means that they edited the base story to appeal to a wider audience, so I would not expect them to be fine pieces of art, rather geared toward the goal of entertainment. I think the film makers were trying to balance the need for blockbuster elements (like action and suspense) with the themes of the novels, and the popularity of both mediums and huge budget created a lot of varying expectations. Which is probably why you see that those on both sides were at least a little disappointed. Personally, the third movie (Mockingjay Part 1) was my favorite, because even though it departed from the novels more (literally), it was a more enjoyable film, because it seemed to best match the spirit of the book. I gave this a 9 because it was true to the books in story and theme, but I credit its bad performance for others on trying to make it too similar to other films (like other war / epic films, or even superhero movies). Unlike what some reviewers seemed to have incorrectly inferred, this franchise is not making any particular political statement (or taking a political side). The story itself has no direct link to any current events (except that it is about war, and there are wars in the world). It does not draw any parallels whatsoever between the ""rebels"" in the movie and any rebel groups in the real world. It is a dystopian story, and it is not based on a real place; Panem is a fictional place (although it has been specified that Panem is North America in the distant future). Being a pacifist, I like to think of this as an anti-war movie, but that would also be incorrect, since some of its main themes are that people ought not be sacrificed in vain, that social progress can be made through war (although always with personal costs), and the importance that the initial cause for war is addressed through it.The main theme of The Hunger Games trilogy is the human tendency to have wars and the importance of preventing them in the first place. There is also a strong focus on how heroes are made (Katniss in this case), through chance and circumstance, and are not necessarily born. The importance of this work in a cultural context, is the portrayal of a female character as a genuine hero, a complex and intelligent character with her own motivations, who becomes thrown into her position as a victim. Rarely today do we actually see women portrayed this way in mainstream media, and although from the book we know that her father had an effect on her, and many male and female characters take part in affecting her, her main motivations and personality seem to be mostly independent of male influences.Another primary theme, especially highlighted by the films is that of the relationship of media with the culture. This was probably the most well delivered and clear cut theme, as it blends seamlessly into the story. Plutarch (Greek) is the character most closely associated with this theme, as he seems to have orchestrated the events, in a way, as ""gamemaker"". Collins has stated that Ancient Greece and Rome were inspirations for The Hunger Games, and plutarchy itself is defined as when the ruling classes are controlled by wealth. And in this case, the wealthy ruling class (as well as the rebels), use media as a way to control the general public. The idea of media being used to not just immobilize and control the masses, but also to affect the public narrative (and define what is true and therefore have power), is an important theme.Although the acting wasn't the highlight of these films, it has to be said that Jennifer Lawrence had a huge influence on this franchise. From the first movie, for which she rightly became so famous for, she defined and changed the Katniss character forever. She was not an obvious choice for this part, but how she interpreted it ultimately drove the franchise to great success. This was always a good story, with irony running deep, but Lawrence gave life and depth to Katniss. Sure, there are a lot of complaints to be made about important plot points that don't transfer well to screen, but with Lawrence they did get it right in the transition from one medium to another, with necessary sacrifices (no pun intended)."

I didn't get it why Peeta must be there at all, and the hell are they doing, and suddenly it becomes a zombie or alike movie where the characters die one by one.And suddenly there's twist that's also not very twisted, and everyone is like losing their own characters. This is so stupid, they should just combine it into one movie. Everything in this movie is not neccessary and too draggy (yes, it's like they keep repeating the same thing over and over again like the audience don't get it), and the relationship between Peeta and Katniss? It just portrayed really bizzarely.It's so empty, I couldn't empath a bit from the perspectives of the characters. It all went down after Catching Fire, they said. Well, I still give Mockingjay part 1 8 stars, it gives emotional waves throughout the movie, but this?No. No. No. This is a big mistake. It just makes everything about Hunger Games goes unappreciated. I give this 3 stars, but actually for the fun ride for those 3 previous movies. This one. None.

Obviously I did not read the novel (nor have I any interest in reading it) but I just wanted to see how the story ends.Both Mockingjay parts were on TV lately. Predictably, they provided the awful ending of yet another trilogy, (stretched into four movies, for monetary reasons). This movie was particularly bad for the awful script that skipped all the dramatic key moments in favor of padding with fight, explosions and CGI.Katniss is in a resistance team known as the Star Squad, composed of Gale, Peeta and other disposable members. She secretly plans to kill evil president Snow, thus dragging her team into the most dangerous zone of the Capitol and getting almost everybody killed.Three quarters of this very long movie are just Kat and team fighting and slowly advancing in the city. Some team members die, more fighting and more casualties etc... Finally, Kat gets close enough to Snow's palace and her plan is just walking in with other refugees, wearing no disguise whatsoever - brilliant!However, the palace gets bombed and Kat knocked out, just after having caught a glimpse of her sister. When Kat wakes up the was is over and the sister is dead. So the two most important events of the movie take place off screen, while the time on screen is filled by silly fighting....After a minute of conversation with Snow, held captive before his execution, Kat is convinced that president Coin is corrupted and must be eliminated, which she does. She moves back to her District with Peeta, they have children and live happily ever after - because Gale knew that the bombing was planned by Coin, so he was also evil, or something to that effect. Even the ""triangle"" part of the plot was disposed off with a line of dialogue and 20 second on screen..."

I thought he was going to jump up and attack Katniss every few scenes! Prim should not have died. Finick should not have died, and in the scene that he died you were trying to create tension? You could have created enough of that if it was a close call! And besides them all DYING there were several mistakes through the movie too!

After the intensely boring setting up of the PART 1, MOCKINGJAY - PART 2 finally sees all of the story lines cleared up in a way which is non-exciting throughout. Once again this is a flabby, overlong production which relies on lots of CGI effects to see it through while offering writing which is constantly weak and clichéd. The cast sleepwalk through their roles, there are twists you'll see coming a mile off, and the whole thing has a generally listless air, like everyone was ready to go on and do something - anything - else. I was also surprised at how little action there was here given the budget and running time; most of it consists of characters outrunning encroaching CGI effects, much as in the disaster flick 2012, and just as uninteresting as those scenes were there."
" Epic, intelligent and a satisfactory end
",0.6705,0.826,2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"This is definitely an underrated movie and I feel the reason is because of the bittersweet end. Unfortunately many people don't recognize the undertones of the whole story: - This is a dystopian tragedy with a great degree of realism. - Katniss Everdeen is not a superhero. She is strong-willed but is also very vulnerable. She experiences fear, sorrow and the whole series does not portray her as an invincible hero, which is why I love her character. In fact, she is not given any special treatment by the rebellion forces but is well-respected for being a symbol of the resistance. - President Snow is not your typical all-bad one-dimensional villain. He is a dictator when it comes to his policies towards the districts, but at the same time he genuinely care about the well-being of his proximal subjects, i.e. the people of the Capitol. This is clearly seen when he provided shelter to all Capitol's refugees and despite knowing he lost the war, he stayed in his mansion amongst his people and did not flee. - President coin on the other hand is an antagonist who was introduced as a protagonist. She is smart, cunning and manipulative. She knows that media play a major role in winning the masses and her propaganda machine was the reason she won. - The war wasn't only about power and military might. Tactics and propaganda played a major role. This is why this movie is intelligent. The rebels weren't stronger, but were smarter. - The only thing that bothered me was that Katniss cried to Rue's death more than Prim's. However, I can understand that with everything going on in the aftermath of Capitol's fall, there wasn't much room for sentiments. We do eventually see her break into tears in a moment of silence and loneliness back in her house in district 12. This is one of those movies series that leaves you feeling emptiness after it concludes. You want more but you know there isn't any. It does conclude in an unpredictable yet very satisfactory way, and that is what I love about it. Overall, excellent acting, cinematography, soundtracks, storytelling and attention to details. I am not giving it 10/10 because of some minor flaws here and there."

Pity it was not fully executed as so by the hero."
" An exciting conclusion to the franchise
",0.4939,0.151,2017-10-01 00:00:00,9,"After the events of the first 'Mockingjay' film Katniss is recovering in District 13 and Peeta, in custody, is still convinced that she is the enemy thanks to his conditioning by those loyal to President Snow and the capital. President Coin, the rebel leader believes that Katniss must be kept safe to be used for propaganda purposes but she is determined that once the attack on the capital gets underway she will take part and that ultimately she will kill Snow. She manages to get to the attacking forces but is put in a unit of high profile rebels who are once again only going to be used for propaganda; even if this time there is some danger from the numerous booby traps set in the outskirts of the city. When the squad leader is killed she tells the others that they are part of a secret mission to kill Snow on the direct orders of Coin. They will face many dangers and many of them won't survive before they get to Snow's mansion then Katniss will have to decide who the real enemy is.Having really enjoyed the previous films I looked forward to this conclusion and wasn't disappointed. There was plenty of action; this was varied and exciting. At times it was a war movie and at others it was close to being a horror movie as they battle genetically engineered 'Mutts' in the sewers. While few viewers will doubt that Katniss will survive and ultimately be triumphant there are some real surprises as other characters die. Panem may be a future North America but certain aspects of the story seem to be inspired by the end of Imperial Russia with Snow in the roll of the Tsar and Coin as Lenin promising freedom for all but likely to be the next oppressor. Of course we have to have a feel good ending this proves to be highly satisfying even if it is more than a little unlikely that the new president would watch the execution of the 'tyrant' from a position that is only slightly above the person due to be shot! Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job as our protagonist and Donald Sutherland impresses as President Snow; somehow he makes the character not totally unsympathetic even after all we've seen him order done. The rest of the cast is pretty solid too. Overall I thought this was a solid conclusion to the series; those who enjoyed the previous instalments should enjoy this and those that didn't probably won't."

The first two were alright, then they decided to pull a Battle Royale 2 (though Battle Royale 2 actually pulled it off, so far nothing else has come close) for the final book. The Twilight franchise was awful to begin with, The Hobbit franchise I could see making two solid movies (not three mediocre ones), and now The Hunger Games. The first part was pretty weak, and I did not enjoy it that much. At least after seeing the first part of the Battle Royale 2: Requiem finale I knew there was going to be TONS more to look forward to, but for this I just do not see it being anything better than a disappointment. The third book was the weakest too, basically almost a desperate attempt to make it as thrilling as the others, which I find really plausible for the movie to do too. Also, some certain characters are going to die, though a lot of them, one in particular, has had little to no development (but that's not the movies' fault, the books were the same way) which will make their death very awkward for me. I'm already picturing myself in the theater looking around while on the screen the character's death is taking a lot of screen time and I'm thinking ""This really has no impact on me whatsoever "". Right now the only thing going for it is that it's got decent actors. But, then again, looking at Fant4stic, this could still It is really bad."
" Such a shame

But as a viewer who never read the books and who became hooked on the first film during a chance viewing, I will say, shame on whoever allowed this film to be made. And shame on me for watching it.Let me just say for those who haven't seen it - nothing actually happens in this film. The previous 3 films (well mainly 1 & 2) lay a solid framework and create a brutal, yet very believable reality. By the end of the 2nd film you cannot help but stand in the corner of Everdeen and co and watch on as they work to bring down the crushing authority responsible for the 'games'. But unfortunately the director does not want us to experience this triumph. Film 3 is a bunch of filler, whilst film 4 (Mockingjay Part 2) is simply a lullaby.There is no redemption for the majority of the characters. Character arcs get completely left out. Wars happen that you never actually see happen. Fear is ongoing (apparently) but all you ever see is Donald Sutherland on a Television screen spouting his mantra. The Hunger Games/Catching Fire build up tremendous momentum.. but the Mockingjay films are there to sap it all up. But be careful, because this film will sap you up too."

That was so, so obvious. Just saying. When the people began trudging off to the Palace, I thought ""what fools"" hell, this movie sure depicts the masses as stupid sheep. Kinda unlikely that people would have fallen for that ol' gimmick. That one is something I'm not just saying.

Unsmiling cold heroine, think UNDERWORLD and ULTRAVIOLET, not my kind of thing. But those franchises were filled with lots and lots of good stretches, this one, blegh, no, not so much. Not so much at all.But I could see what they saw in the concept of the first one. Sport to the death (for the guys), and a kick-ass heroine (generally for everybody) That first bit of the theme was, oddly enough, discarded. Don't know why. Don't really care, not my thing anyway, but they were sitting there with the golden goose..."
" Bad war scene
",-0.8126,-0.9783,2017-06-04 00:00:00,5,"They should take some military consultant for the war scene. Realsm of war scene need a good consultant. In the war scene there's only full of infantry. There's no artillery, cavalry, etc. The mixing of a lot of infantry and multi-role combat plane are bad decision. The war look like a fake war."
" An astonishing finale to an exceptional franchise
",0.0,0.9984,2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" defiantly finishes the franchise with a bang, no not a bang something even more than that. ""Mockingjay Part 2"" defiantly gives the fans a more than satisfying conclusion. The plot begins at the same point ""Mockingjay Part 1"" left off. For all past deaths made as entertainment, and for the insidious modification of Peeta, Katniss deems to strike out on her own to take down President Snow once and for all, but being the Mockingjay, the living symbol of the rebellion now headed by Alma Coin, has its drawbacks. Recognition, for one, and she finds herself saddled with a team of expert warriors (which surprisingly includes the ailing Peeta) aimed to penetrate the Capitol that has barricaded itself behind Hunger-Game-style death traps. As she closes in on carrying out her private agenda through more deaths and mayhem, President Snow himself makes her aware of another threat to peace for Panem equal to himself, leaving her to consider how to truly end the bloodshed. Once again the director ""Francis Lawrence"" is very smooth with his style and truly is the perfect director for these films. He again brings very beautiful visuals to the screen with the locations and brings back the ""games"" in a perfect way. ""Jennifer Lawrence"" was exceptional as always but in this one she defiantly boosts her performance as a character with PTSD. I can proudly say that this is the best she preformed in the franchise and even up to ""Silver Linings"" and ""Joy"" standards. ""Josh Hutcherson"" is very good in this film as well. Although this is his toughest part in the role yet is defiantly not his best as I liked him a lot better in Mockingjay Part 1. ""Sam Claflin"" also boosts his game as Finnick Odair and with a lot more screen time then he had in ""Mockingjay Part 1"". This film has major character development and its amazing to watch on screen. To see where Katniss began at the beginning of the movie to the end blows your mind. But unfortunately the Secondary characters do not have as big character development they still do have some. You can tell they spent every single penny they had wisely on this film. With an extremely high budget of an estimated $160 Million the special effects are exceptional. The underground lizard mutts where very very well done in terms of CGI as well as the multiple explosions and the avenue of the tributes in snows execution scene. The Original Motion Score composed by James Newton Howard was one of the best in the Franchise. With the multiple standouts being, your favourite colour is green, Sewer Attack, Rebels Attack, Snows Execution and the Medley. Once again the Pace in this film is perfect. The aim when Squad 451 got into the capitol was to make it feel like a ghost town and the pace at that point made it feel so much more like the ghost town they where going for. Then it starts to speed up with the majority of the action scenes in the middle at its climax. Overall ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" is a more than satisfying ending to the franchise as it goes out with a bang. With exceptional acting, characters, special effects, pace and a perfect score and no flaws. In my opinion it's the best in the franchise. I give 2015's ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2"" a 10/10"""
" Ridiculous.
",-0.3612,-0.9118,2017-05-14 00:00:00,1,"And Jennifer Lawrence was a good actor. Really? Not much to say about this final (thank God) installment. The movie was about a bunch of running, hiding, Lawrence's lack of acting skills, and a bomb of an ending. And I BOUGHT this movie. What an idiot I was. I'll be lucky to sell it at my next garage sale for 50 cents. My husband who was a major Hunger Games fan, hated it also. I had to stop him from frisbeeing it out of the yard. No spoilers here."
" Boring, Unintelligent and Underwhelming
",-0.6486,0.0711,2017-04-16 00:00:00,4,"Well, that was rather disappointing unfortunately. Not that I can say that I am very surprised though. The first installment in the series started off being ""okayish"" and the rest of them slid downwards towards mediocrity. This, the final installment, is a notch below mediocre as far as I am concerned. I really cannot understand all the hype about these movies. None of them really shines even if you try to look at them as young adult movies which they really are.This one was downright boring. There were numerous scenes where Katniss or some other character was just dreaming away or sitting around brooding. It took quite a while for anything to start happening in the movie.When something started happening it was the same mess of political, unbelievably stupid, propaganda, messy and unintelligent fight scenes, Katniss walking around looking, I do not really known, disconcerted, sad, disturbed, whatever.How the chief villains (yes plural) was one could figure out without too much effort. The moment the flyer came into the picture and started to fly over the refuges and the children not only I but all of my kids as well guessed who had sent it.There is really only two things that I liked about this movie. One is that Donald Sutherland was really good. The other is the ending which, although being 100% predictable, was quite satisfying. Well, that scene (everyone having seen the movie knows which scene I am referring to) is where I consider the movie to have ended. After that it was only boring filler scenes remaining."
" Boring!
",-0.3802,-0.9614,2017-03-17 00:00:00,4,"The movie is very long and very boring. Just when you think it is over, it tacks on the longest denouement in movie history.The plot of this movie is a group of soldiers have to get from A to B. Their way is blocked by various traps: explosions, automatic guns, and I kid you not, mummies they call ""mutts"".The characters are mostly one-dimensional soldiers. They justify killing civilians and children. They believe their opponents are so wicked, any atrocity is justified. These are the supposed heroes, but they are disgusting.I had trouble telling the characters apart. Characters die, but I could not figure out who died. This was further confused by the heroine coming back to life at least three times.Our soldier heroine has some qualms about killing but does it anyway dispatching her victims with arrows. She has some ""mockingjay"" superpower, but it was never adequately explained. Perhaps that is clarified in part 1.The most interesting part of the movie is the sets. The characters traverse the length of a huge futuristic city, blasted by war. I don't know how they created the illusion. It was completely believable and intricate.Donald Sutherland as the arch-villain President Snow has some incisive fascinating dialogue, delivered perfectly, but he is on screen for only a short time.Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee is also on screen only a short time. His part is quite bland. Using him was a bit of a waste.There is a lot about how deception, lying and propaganda are integral to war. I took these as allusions to American politics.Jena Malone as the bald, drug addicted, jittery Johanna Mason deserves special mention. She was so creepy, again only on screen for a short time."
" Pretty poorly edited
",0.4939,0.9299,2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"I think the plot of this movie could have been better, a lot of important things in the books were excluded. But that could be explained by the fact that they couldn't fit in. What really bothered me is the editing. The Hunger Games was a brilliant movie. I liked how they used a lot of real fire. The following too were good as well, I didn't spot any editing mistakes. But this movie had some mistakes that really caught my eye, even the first time I saw it. When we see the dam in Capitol and there is water flowing through it as always, the flow just stops at one point and for a good five seconds there is just massive amounts of water flowing into water that is completely unmoving. It kind of looks like ice to me. Every time there's an explosion it looks like some royalty free green screen effect."
" A complete waste of acting talent, and time if you watch this .
",0.0,-0.431,2017-03-01 00:00:00,5,"I watched all 4 of these films, and saw just how bad a franchise can fall. This effort was absolute rubbish, and what was worse the evidence was to be seen by its trailer.Just about all the effect scenes squeezed in.Enjoy the first two films, but avoid like the plague the last pair. To sum up ....mock both jays......they deserve the full treatment, on the verbal use table."
" A Bit Better Than What I Expected, But Still Plagued By A Number Of Issues
",0.34,0.9915,2017-02-26 00:00:00,6,"Judging the final portion of the Hunger Games series is tricky because of all the things it had going against it at its release:-It's based on the weakest book in the series (IMHO) -It shouldn't have been broken into two parts to begin with. -A number of it's stars have kind of outgrown their roles in terms of popularity.As such, I went into this film with incredibly low expectations (I almost didn't even see it in the theater). As it turned out, I was surprisingly entertained, though not anywhere near overwhelmed.For a basic plot summary, ""Mockingjay Part 2"" picks up right where ""Part 1"" left off, with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) completely stunned by the brainwashing of Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) by the Capital. Because of this treatment, Katniss decides to embrace her role as the symbolic Mockingjay and help President Coin (Julianne Moore) rally the troops. This strategy works, as the coalition of District's seems to be making progress. However, is that just all part of President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) grand plan?The first half of this movie was painfully slow and sometimes even bordering on boring. I had worries that it was going to be a total disaster, to be honest. Fortunately, after the sewer scene with the Mutts that was legitimately scary, the film really picked up. Much like my experience with reading the Mockingjay book, the ending worked for me. I can't really even exactly explain why, but the ending to this franchise is compelling.Of course, this is a series specifically targeted young adults (that just happened to cross-over big time), so it has a few things it has to do, some of which work and some of which do not. For example, Gale (Liam Hemsworth) has nothing important to do the entire movie, except fulfill his place in the love triangle of the franchise. On the flip side, though, I had forgotten how many parallels to our conflicts in the Middle East there are in this narrative. That material is a bit heavy-handed and obvious (again, to suit the YA audience), but it works pretty well nonetheless.Perhaps the strangest thing about this movie though? While skewing darker than any of the previous films, which you would think would alienate some of the teens who are just going for the spectacle, it also takes the most ""emotional buy in"" to really get invested (as it relies so heavily on the love triangle), which plays exactly to that teen audience. So, a bit of a tug-of-war throughout in terms of tone.Overall, ""Mockingjay 2"" is better than its immediate predecessor, but combine both films and the narrative is still the worst in the franchise. Again, though, I thought the same thing about the book, so I wasn't terribly surprised. Had they made ""Mockingjay"" a single film, I think I would have enjoyed it better. It would have been better paced and it could have better taken advantage of its stars (by 2015, Lawrence and even Hemsworth are ""too big"" for these roles now). As it stands, though, it's a middling ending to the franchise (saved in large part by an emotional final 20-30 minutes)."
" Mediocre BATTLE ROYALE 2 Rippoff !! I really felt no need to root for the heroes throughout the film !!
",-0.5689,0.9097,2017-02-17 00:00:00,1,"After a long time Nippon Shuppan Hanbai gives such a well scripted, well acted and thrilling film.I didn't go into the theater with much expectations. I was really surprised by the depth of script in terms of r-rated teenage warfare. I cannot say whether it was accurate or not, although it doesn't matter as which Japanese films are accurate anyways. All they need is to fool the audience well enough.Accurate or not the r-rated stuff was really thrilling and was very well presented!! Totally blew Collin's water-down ripoffs out of the park! And Thank God at least one director in Japan is enlightened enough to stick to Takami's original source material!...How disappointing, on the other hand, that the American's failed to acknowledge her blatant plagiarism, while all other Nations look on in derision :("
" epic way to end a great series!
",0.6588,0.9864,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Such a good ending and it really does tie in things very well. Jennifer Lawrence is great as usual as Katniss and she really does a great send off to the character. She is one of the strongest female leads in a movie period. Spoiler Warning: I looved that her and Peeta ended up together and I looved the ending and how everything worked out in the end. The message of hope and endurance is so strong in this movie. With all of these young adult action movies like Harry Potter, Twilight, Divergent, etc the same type of theme that comes out of these films in hope and how we should never give up. I guess that's why so many people, myself included love these films. They show that even in hard times there is light and hope."
" 'The Hunger Games' franchise ends on an anaemic whimper
",-0.25,0.9976,2017-02-07 00:00:00,5,"Don't really care for any of 'The Hunger Games' films (though none of them are terrible either, and whether they are rip-offs or not is irrelevant to me), although some of the films' cast have fared very well throughout, especially Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland. Along with the source material being so good, it was the cast that was the reason for sticking until the end.Of the four, 'Catching Fire' for me was the best, it could have been much better but at least it tried to (if only slightly) up the ""hunger"" from 'The Hunger Games' and didn't feel anywhere near like the bland and over-stretched set up that was basically 'Mockingjay-Part 1'. 'Mockingjay-Part 2' is to me an improvement on 'Part 1', it's heavily flawed and far from great but there are things that are done slightly better (though the execution is still less than completely successful) over 'Part 1'.The effects are better and less dodgy (the best of the franchise). Although the character development is simplistic, too neat rather than complex and not particularly interesting at least this does actually try to develop the characters. And there is more action in comparison to the very padded and sedate previous film, although they lack excitement and tension and are lit somewhat too dimly. The strengths of 'Part 1' however are the same here, likewise are the flaws, hence why the wording in both reviews is going to be very similar.'Mockingjay-Part 2' certainly has good things. The production values, some over-dim lighting aside, are very well done with the nightmarishly dystopian production design faring best and luckily the cinematography and editing is not the sloppy and frenetic kind seen in the first film. The special effects are less problematic than before. The score is thrilling and emotive, and there are some good performances here. This is particularly true of a terrific Jennifer Lawrence, dastardly Donald Sutherland, moving Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his last films before his tragic ultimely death, smarmy Stanley Tucci and classy Julianne Moore (although her character arc is a bit flat overall).Not all the cast work. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are still lacking charisma and expression, while Elizabeth Banks (a high point of the first film) and Woody Harrelson again have nothing to do and are practically pop-ups.Writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time. The chemistry between Lawrence, Hutcherson and Hemsworth just isn't there.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay-Part 2' could have easily been shorter, because the story feels far too thin and over-stretched with a lot of colourless and not always relevant padding which makes some scenes interminably dull and dreary rather than fresh, tense or exciting. It was somewhat inevitable with 'Part I' but for a franchise conclusion it was unforgivable. The ending is again very anti-climactic, which is a large part of why the franchise doesn't end on a bang and feels so anaemic.In spirit, 'Mockingjay-Part 2' feels very tame, no improvement over the previous films, which also suffered from a lack of suspense, excitement, the conflict not being as threatening as ought and the satirical edge not being sharp enough. The complete anti-thesis of the scary, thrilling and moving stories that the books tell, even when adhering the basic details and such closely the spirit and atmosphere is severely dissipated in film form in all four 'Hunger Games' films.Overall, an anaemic whimper of a franchise conclusion. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
" Finally, the pain is over
",-0.5106,-0.6014,2017-02-03 00:00:00,3,"Finally, I've got to the end of this series and I am going to be glad that there are no more movies to look forward to. Mind you, there is the Allegrant series, but then again I feel that I am at that stage where I am going to pretty much ignore the final one in the series because, well, there is nothing all that different between that one and this one. Okay, this one was a little darker than the Allegrant series, though the Maze Runner movies were, I have to admit, somewhat better. Anyway, I'm not so much talking about those movies, but this one, in particular why they decided to split the final book into two. Well, I guess because Twilight and Harry Potter did it, so they probably should as well. Also, I'm glad that somebody bought the Hunger Games box set at the church fate because after watching these movies I would be regretting spending the money on it.Well, Peter has been rescued, but it turns out that they had been torturing him, and he isn't the Peter that Katnis once new. Well, the fact that he tried killing her at the end of the last movie does suggest that. So, somewhat upset at President John Snow (who as a bad guy, really doesn't come across all that well), Katnis decides to go and kill him, however Coin won't let her leave the compound due to her being too precious. Well, she sneaks out anyway, and through the use of surveillance Coin discovers this (tell be again how these rebels are any different). So, the old gang gets pack together for a final strike against the headquarters of John Snow (that name keeps on reminding me of the really cool Game of Thrones character – couldn't Collins have picked a different name).As it turns out (I've used this a lot in these reviews), the entire city has been booby trapped with bombs that explode in particular ways, and they have a holo generator that tells them where they are. Thus the movie has them pass one bomb, step into another wiping out half the party, and then getting caught up in a third one which wipes out all but a handful. Then they make a mad dash towards the citadel only to be caught up in a bombing raid.Anyway, all I can say about this film is that it was predictable – very, very predictable. In fact when it came to the end and Coin declared herself interim president or an indefinite period I simply rolled my eyes. Seriously, couldn't it have been a lot more dramatic. As for the ending, well, it just took forever to end. Seriously, it could have been much more effective, and much more dramatic than it really was. In fact, as I watch the film come to an end all I could say is that I'm not surprised that the film ended the way it did because, well, all the other endings were pretty horrible as well."
" :-|
",-0.1779,0.9104,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"This is a decent closing movie to the Hunger Games series, as it provides closure to the two main characters. You will love the ""arrow shooting scene!"" Catniss learns some stuff about who is in charge and goes on a spree. The final scene brings everything to a full circle, and you will learn a little bit.I think this movie doesn't measure up to the first film, but it doesn't have to. Sequels rarely do. Don't come in to this movie expecting a classic, and you won't be disappointed. Just come in expecting a rollick of a movie with a decent story and good action scenes if you are a fan of the series.** 1/2 out of ****"
" The worst you could expect
",-0.6249,0.983,2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"Hey let's get some rest!!Yes, that sentence above is what you see in first half of the film, After almost every fight Katniss's team have, they need to get rest!! Why?! Because the writer just couldn't find a way to answer emotional issues they have. At the time you want to see what is going on in the field this triangle of love slows you down a lot! Why because the writer just couldn't find some other times for their issue and the funny thing is, it all goes to an unsolved mystery at the end!The First half of the film has a very slow storytelling and like part 1 you are just watching the guesses for what may happen in the Big War! That's not the only problem for this part 2 of Hunger Games Mockingjay movie which could be all in one part too!! There are many unsolved mysteries in this part. We wait almost 1 year to find out what happened to the Peeta that he acts crazy and the funny thing is you never find out! You never see what President Snow have done to him, any torture or brain washing or and etc. yes nothing at all! And then after few attacks from him to Katniss all the problem solve with one snow white kiss!! Good very romantic!!! Another problem is you waited all these long to see the big power of Capital and President Snow and during first half of the film you see that he is talking about big war and horrible attacks that come to the Katniss team but what you get is just a mix cocktail of his traps during the Hunger Game 1 and some zombie beasts!!!! Yeah, no big army or smart plan to fill the city with blood!!(As he says in the beginning) the best hilarious problem, at the end of the film, is the triangle love we spoke about. You never get any clue how and why Gale wants to betray against its own people and especially Katniss, because he knows she would be in the place where bombs drop! so in one scene she asks Gale that: have you done it and he says Yes, oh my God, can you believe it, problem solved Gale suddenly becomes the bad guy for no reason and Katniss left all alone for Peeta !wow what could be more tragic than this!!! And here we are achieving the best Part. The moment director and writer surprise you!!! Wow, what it is!! Katniss will go to kill President Snow in front of all people and get revenge? Does she let President Alma coin who we clearly see that is turning a new President Snow with dictator ideas win this war? Oh wow, what a surprise! Katniss just killed President Alma!! I mean come on that was your best shot!!!! Anyway sorry it took long but this movie was really on my nerve after what I saw in Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which was a new idea and admired it but what we saw later was only disappointment. Thank you for reading my review."
