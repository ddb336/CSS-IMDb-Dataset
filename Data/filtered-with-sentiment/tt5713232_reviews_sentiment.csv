" ""Irfan Khan.. doing different sub-genres of road movie""
",0.0,-0.34,2020-09-21 00:00:00,9,"After the long gap, we get another original film from Kamath. Casting Irfan Khan as a lead was the best decision for this, who was already doing different sub-genres of road movie by then. This is a classic high-octane drama being a crime thriller. Having said that, it criticises the trope of revenge sagas by revealing the futileness of the same in the end. I liked that they even bashed the media industry, but had to cut something because of having slow pace."

",0.0,-0.8555,2020-05-21 00:00:00,9,"Hard Hitting performance by Late Irfan Khan, This Movie is a Mirror to those Indians who are divided by the politicians for their ulterior gains.

" Reality Behind The Image
",0.0,-0.6111,2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,"In our private life, we look ourselves in images which can be original or have passed through filter of beautification. We know what we are? But while looking at the image, we try to satisfy ourselves. But anyhow we manage. But in public life, image does not tell the truth. What we see is an illusion or fake. Reality hides behind it. We see only those images which are allowed to be shown. But sometimes some incident happens and the image get washed and illusion vanishes. The truth comes in such a manner in front of us that we can not believe. This movie is all about this. A common man free of any outer world get shock one day and his life becomes hollow. In movie there is a dialogue, "" The common man is very common, can't be identified easily "". This is all.Thank You & Must Watch"

" A Film Which Will Give You Goose Bumps
",0.0,0.2085,2020-05-03 00:00:00,7,"When he gets angry, you get angry. When he laughs, you laugh. When he cries, you cry. Irrfan Khan is one of the few actors of modern day cinema who carry unique ability to glue their audience with the celluloid moment in which they create their own reality. An Actor, who has achieved a sort of iconic status lately, has reappeared in his latest Bollywood venture ""Madaari"" directed by Nishikant Kamat who has previously directed films like ""Mumbai Meri Jaan"" and ""Force"". With powerful content, nonlinear storytelling with flashbacks and emotionally charged performance by Irrfan Khan, ""Madaari"" connects its viewers on their subconscious level and alleviates them to such an emotional state where it becomes difficult for them to differentiate between real and reel pain.
A society in which corruption has become daily routine and importance of a human life is always the last thing in the mind of ruling elite, justice seems like a Utopian idea. Under such circumstances a powerless commoner who is also grieving for death of his only son in man-made disaster, can either go for ending his own life or he can take completely different route by seeking answers from individuals who are indirectly accountable for the death of his son. By kidnapping only son of India's Home Minister, equivalent to Interior Minister of Pakistan, he creates such havoc in the heart of powerful ruling elite which eventually make them bow to his demands. Curiosity, anxiety and events leading to penultimate stage of the film are so profound which twitch viewers' sense of seemingly ""All OK"" perception and create such an impact drama on silver screen which pokes us hard. Nishikant Kamat has skillfully used the talent of Irrfan Khan like an error-free technician who wants nothing but excellence on every frame in which Irrfan Khan appears.
In today's world of Indian cinema where only content-less films crossing 100 Crores are important, ""Madaari"" is an anomaly which blatantly challenges pseudo-realm of typical Bollywood masala flicks. From the first frame to last 'Madaari' is an Irrfan Khan's film but Jimmy Shergill as Investigating Officer Nachiket Verma impresses with his serious but meticulous performance. On the whole ""Madaari"" is a kind of film which gives you goose bumps and silent moments when you come out of cinema hall and words from Faiz Ahmed Faiz's famous poem ""Bol Kay Lub Azaad Hain Tery"" are said during final credits of the film in husky voice of Irrfan Khan.

" Irfan üôè
",0.0,-0.8801,2019-05-18 00:00:00,8,Madaari revolves around a suffering of a common man and the Indian system and how that common man really become a pain in the ass. Nonchalantly he portraits the role and make us believe whatever we are watching. It's a must watch.

" very average movie
",0.0,0.9161,2017-12-18 00:00:00,4,"I don't exactly know why people are rating this movie so high. Probably because of Irrfan Khan or because they feel emotional about the plot. The movie is poorly written and the dialogues sound like they were written by a 15 year old. I've actually seen better dialogues written for theater by students. The actors are all great, I've seen most of them do some really good roles in other movies but the director failed to get the best out of them. This movie could have been a lot better."
" Brilliant Movie but a little over stretched
",0.34,0.8793,2017-05-20 00:00:00,9,I think its a Must watch for any movie lover who loves watching Anil Kapoor's Nayak kind of movies Irfan is brilliant as always but only negative thing i notice is this cud have been far better with more realistic direction and should be 10 minutes less than what it is everything else is brilliant
" Common Man fights back at the system
",-0.4019,0.861,2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"""People don't expect rulers to have commoners fate"".A common man who lost his son in an accident that was the result of negligence and corruption, hits back at the system, by kidnapping the Home Minister's son to pressurize them into finding who was accountable for the accident and get him punished. The Minister, tries to manage his public image and political ties, while also trying to ensure that he finds his son.On this basic premise, the film revolves around the hunt for the kidnapper and the kid. It also shows the relationship that develops between the kidnapper and the kid. Irrfan Khan as the kidnapper and Jimmy Shergill as the investigator deliver a powerhouse performance with great support from the child actor Vishesh Bansal (though he sometimes sounds a little too mature for his age).The story line is pretty straightforward, without much being left to anticipation. The psychological battle between the kidnapper and the investigator is what keeps the audience engaged, but by no means is it a action packed, fast paced thriller. The story moves ahead at a gentle pace, focusing more on the feelings of the characters, than on the action. The climax though very powerfully written, leaves too much to be said in too little a space, thus missing out a bit in creating the desired impact. The music is well placed and adds to the storytelling."
