" Not sure the is quite what le CarrÃ© would have wanted...
",-0.2411,0.9451,2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,"I have to say that I rather enjoyed this - but that was almost entirely down to the rather vulgar, flamboyant performance from Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd than anything to do with the rather far-fetched plot. That centres around the holidaying ""Perry"" (Ewan McGregor) and lawyer wife ""Gail"" (Naomie Harris) who are having a bit of a rocky patch with their marriage. This trip to Marrakesh isn't really doing it for them either, so when she leaves him in the hotel bar, he is befriend by ""Dima"" (SS) and is soon embroiled in a totally ridiculous plot to smuggle secret Russian bank account data to the UK in return for the British Government (""Hector"" - Damian Lewis) ensuring the safety of his rather large family. What takes it down silly street is the complicity of this rather academic married couple with the whole thing! Perilous is not the word for the dangers they face - yet they embrace the danger - and their role in a government sting operation - almost as a marriage guidance tool. A cast of famous faces - including the wonderful Carlos Acosta (in ballet shoes rather than as an actor, thankfully) along with Saskia Reeves and a seriously underused Jeremy Northam clutter up the pace, somewhat - as do the all too lengthy (if rather enjoyable to watch) cultural outings at the Bolshoi. Susanna White doesn't seem to quite know what she wants from this film - and so it's left to SkarsgÃ¥rd to dominate with an underperforming McGregor to follow like a rather stunned puppy dog. Looks good, as you'd expect - plenty of glamorous scenarios in Paris, Moscow and the rather sterile Einstein Museum in Bern, but as a thriller it just, well, doesn't."

" Uninspiring and Not Good Enough
",-0.3412,0.9549,2021-02-11 00:00:00,5,"Perry (Ewan McGregor) meets a Russian money launderer Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) on Moroccan vacation with his wife, Gail (Naomie Harris). Dima asked him to deliver incriminating evidence to MI6 because he knows the Russian mafia wants him and his family dead. He hopes the British Intelligence can get them safety away. However, the MI6 has dirt on their selves.Don't expect this movie to be like North by Northwest or The Man Who Knew Too Much. This story would be better off directed by Hitchcock. The trailer made it look like a potential good film. The movie is not good and it has slow pace (boring). It doesn't have enough action or suspense and the thrill it does have won't keep audience attention.They don't give enough character development (except Dima & MI6 agent) at all. They are one dimension and these character's make wrong decision. They never explore the relationship between Perry and Gail. We only known a little that he had an affair with one of his students but that didn't not explain why his wife is distant and nags at him. After they got involved with all the spy world they got closer then ever and she sees her husband strong side. Perry had better chemistry with his friendship with Dima. Not even the cast couldn't save this movie they deserve better than this."

Not gimmicky, no stupid cgi effects but people you care about/are interested in, motives you can understand and a believable story. Refreshing! And not an American in sight!

Would have been more believable if the whole thing had been toned down to a local parish councillor taking back handers for some property development!Pretty film. Pretty pointless. If you don't want to be vexed and would like to just mill away an hour or so, you get a jolly romp, some opulant parlours, and nice shots of Switzerland."
" seemed like it was made years back
",0.3612,0.8098,2020-03-20 00:00:00,4,"The movie is kind of slow and feels like watching an old b-movie 1997-8 but not a good one. Even a good cast can't hide the American Anti-Russian stereo-type of corruption,not really captured the true story but more hyped up trash. The cast was good, i like watching films with Naomie Harris ,Damien Lewis and that unknown actor if only he used the force. It seemed every time Perry Makepeace (McGregor) met a group of Russian one would be hitting a woman and he would complain,great undercover work at its best."

It was gripping enough and the acting was decent. This gripe is a little petty but what the hell... Damian Lewis' accent and/or over acting was the only truly annoying aspect of the movie. And I like him as an actor. I just didn't understand the need to make him annoying to listen to."

" between the Cold Wars
",-0.5574,0.9941,2019-01-31 00:00:00,6,"I'm a big fan of John le CarrÃ©. He is one of my favorite writers in one of my favorite literary genres - spy thrillers. His books are very ""cinematic"" in the structure, and it is no surprise that they have all been adapted to big screens or television series. The characters in the books and the films inspired by John de Carre's novels are revealing themselves gradually, as the action advances, but never completely, thus the readers or the viewers always remain with the impression that some details are being kept in the shadows even after the last page of the novel or after the credits at the end of the movie. Like many other espionage writers, as well as like the secret services described in his novels, John le Carre had to look for new enemies after the break-up of the Iron Curtain and the fall of communism. In his novels after 1990, the role of the 'bad guys' began to be played by global terrorists or mafias in former communist countries. But the last decade has also meant the return of Russia on the global scene and the threat of a new Cold War. 'Our Kind of Traitor' published in 2011 is John le Carre's first novel in which the signs of the new Cold War appear. The 2016 movie directed by Susanna White is a pretty faithful adaptation of the novel.Two categories of typical le Carre heroes appear in this film. Perry (Ewan McGregor ) is an idealist intellectual who is ready to sacrifice the his peaceful life to help a friend or serve a good cause when confronted with limit situations. Hector (Damian Lewis) is an MI6 agent who faces the eternal problem of corruption and duplicity of his bosses and has to resort to unconventional methods to bring the truth to light. The two will meet when Perry is chosen by a financier of the Russian mafia named Dima (the Swedish actor Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd ) to facilitate his passage to the English side with his whole family. It is not the most complex and interesting of the novels written by John le Carre, but the story has enough material for an exciting action thriller.Susanna White has little experience with feature films, being especially known for directing episodes in TV series. Her lack of experience or inspiration is visible in this adaptation, correct but lacking in emotion. There were some exciting action threads that could have been exploited - such as the dilemmas of the British agent confronted with the corruption of politicians and the bosses' complicity, the relationship between Perry and his wife faced with the dilemma of personal sacrifice in order to help a dubious friend that he had just known, or the terror of the family of the Russian bankerwho had decided to change allegiances. None of these topics is approached more than at a superficial level, to the extent that they serve the action. The only interesting acting is by Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd . 'Our Kind of Traitor' is an acceptable action movie, but the impression I was left with was that it could have been more than that."
" Predictable but enjoyable
",0.5927,0.5542,2019-01-12 00:00:00,7,As the headline says. You can see the plot unfold before you however it's still very watchable. I enjoyed it very much.
" Absolute Drivel
",0.0,0.8853,2018-12-27 00:00:00,1,So boring even the great Damian Lewis acts like a prat. Ewan McGreggor however excels as mop head thick as too short planks professor whose dithering bravery is completely laughable. Can't believe this is written by Le Carre he must have done it with just one sitting on the toilet. Avoid this truly appalling guff.
" Disappointing

" a great spy thriller
",0.6705,0.761,2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that neither side is innocent when someone tries to defect. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A So-So Spy Movie
",0.0,-0.5296,2018-10-09 00:00:00,5,"The location shots were nice and I took a tour of Europe with this movie. Not a good adaption of this book I would think. Two goofs...McGregor never shot a weapon yet he kills the guy with his one shot. The Russian find out where the traitor is hiding yet they send only 3, THREE people to capture them. I'd send at least a dozen. Another film that you can skip."
" John LeCarre - hard to go wrong
",-0.5423,0.9726,2018-10-06 00:00:00,7,"Good thriller from the master, John Le Carre, with some very interesting visuals by the director, Susanna White.The story concerns a young couple (Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris) who meet a Russian, Dima (Stellan Skarsgard). It turns out that Dima wants something delivered to British intelligence, which the naive McGregor does. Dima is involved with the Russian mafia and he has information that will bring down corrupt politicians in London. When the couple delivers the flash drive to Hector (Damien Lewis) in British Intelligence, they find themselves embroiled in a dangerous situation.Some real revelations here for me anyway - first of all, I've never heard Damien Lewis speak with his native British accent; second, I've never before considered Stellan Skarsgard as having any sex appeal. His portrayal of the loud, friendly, charismatic Dima is fantastic. With people like Lewis and Skarsgard in the cast, you know the acting will be top level, and it is. McGregor and Harris hold their own, as good people who can't walk away from Dima and his family.Very good."
" Boring and improbable
",-0.3182,0.5362,2018-07-29 00:00:00,2,Fell asleep after 1/2 hour. Unlikely opening premise (would YOU go to a excessive party by that guy after knowing him a few minutes?) and zero action. This is supposed to be a thriller? Bah.
" Very good entertainment
",0.7408,0.934,2018-06-17 00:00:00,7,"Very good entertainment. Recommend it for a Friday evening. Good actors, good trama."
" Surprisingly entertaining
",0.6249,0.9454,2018-06-12 00:00:00,7,"Not the best big-screen adaptation of a John LeCarre novel but even a second-rate LeCarre offers its pleasures. The plot of ""Our Kind of Traitor"" may be a tad far-fetched but then the plots of most good spy yarns often are. The Cold War having ended it's the Russian Mafia who take centre-stage here and as the Russian oligarch who wants to defect Stellan Skarsgard is one of the best things in the picture. Indeed, it's well cast throughout, (Damian Lewis is particularly good as a cynical MI6 operative), and typically there is some nice location work nicely shot by DoP Anthony Dod Mantle. If the director Sussana White doesn't do anything particularly innovative with the material at least she doesn't muck things up. Minor, then, but also surprisingly entertaining, too."
" Contrived
",0.0,0.599,2018-06-12 00:00:00,5,"I watched it last night. I expected a spy story, with such a cast ,a sophisticated spy story. If I can imagine a scenario that fits just what I saw, I would say its just as if an amateur writer was asked to have a crack at a spy story. Listed before the writer were several plotlines that had to be fulfilled, including a certain kind of ending. Using that information just go ahead and do your best with the development of the story. The characters were not developed so as to have any sort of opinion about anything that happened to them. The disjointed plot just dragged all the players toward a contrived pre ordained ending. It wasn't enjoyable because the characters, plot, and story development were not consistent with each other. Sometimes spy stories can be puzzlingly complex, but this one was puzzlingly amateurish."
" Gripping and subtle
",0.0,0.9883,2018-04-28 00:00:00,9,"It could have gone bad, bland, boring hundreds of times and it didn't, on the contrary. Ewan McGregor managed to give a character that could have easily been flat credibility. His subtle interpretation of his character's motivation made his choices in the movie believable in a very far-fetched scenario, pulling you in bit by bit. This, combined with his great chemistry with Skarsgard, Damian Lewis's enigmatic presence, Harris's grounded delivery and the beautiful cinematography (Anthony Dod Mantle did a beautiful job) made the movie a joy to watch. What I found most exciting about the movie is that it showcases a great understanding of human psychology without spelling it out for the audience, that's what makes pieces of the movie pop up in your head minutes, hours after the movie is done. Also, the couple relationships are beautifully, realistically portrayed and the cultural background of the characters. I just loved to see on screen, in a thriller no less, good and simple life wisdom in practice, not spoon fed, overbearing or pretentious. Very rare."
" It had a decent cast with Skellasgard and Lewis as well as...
",0.2732,0.9449,2018-04-03 00:00:00,6,"Naomi Harris but it seemed the males were not vert strong personalities. It was a decent rendering then again it seemed like a contract obligation by Le Carre towards what contract he currently has with what publisher. The action wasn't the problem as much as the sub plot was bare bones.. As many have stated a fairly predictable plot. For me it was akin to 'the Night Manager' then again perhaos tis was Le Carre 'borrowing' heavily from that script to flesh out a 6 episode series for Tom Huddleston, Hugh Laurie et. al..Daniel Lewis was at his best - controlled but believable. The best rendition of a Le Carre was the old 'Tinker Tailor Solider Spy' with Alec Guiness 'because' it had the luxury of stretching out the plot over 7 episodes nearly 40 years ago (1979)."

" Too much of a genre story
",0.0,0.9612,2018-02-21 00:00:00,5,Our Kind of Traitor is a solid but dull film with a lot of foreign location shooting but it is also rather predictable.I understand that some of the people who worked on the BBC television series The Night Manager also worked in this film. Whereas the long form television series managed to maintain its tension and had several well staged set pieces throughout its running length. This was lackluster.Perry (Ewan McGregor) a lecturer and his wife Gail (Naomie Harris) a lawyer are on holiday in Marrakesh. Perry is invited to party with Dima (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) a brash Russian who is really a financier for a Russian mobster.Dima asks for Perry's help to save his family by becoming a MI6 informant as he has information on British financiers and politicians who have laundered money for the Russian underworld. Perry needs to contact a sympathetic MI6 agent.It is well acted especially by SkarsgÃ¥rd but it all feels rather restraint.
" Spy Kids
",0.0,0.7184,2018-02-19 00:00:00,4,"The novelty here seems to be that amateurs Professor Perry (Ewan McGregor) and Gail (Naomie Harris) agree to become involve in espionage because they feel it is the right thing to do.But ""doing the right thing"" doesn't really seem to cost them anything -- they sail through potentially lethal situations with ease. It feels like they are simply following a predetermined path and that no harm can come to them; so there's no reason to care what happens.All in all, a pretty pointless exercise."
" not quite good enough
",-0.3865,-0.3426,2017-10-17 00:00:00,5,"College professor Perry MacKendrick (Ewan McGregor) and lawyer wife Gail are vacationing in Marrakech despite his cheating. He reluctantly accepts the mysterious Dima (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd)'s invitation to his daughter's birthday party. Dima reveals that he launders money for the Russian mob and recruits him to contact MI6 upon returning to London. British agent Hector (Damian Lewis) convinces Perry to meet up with Dima in Paris.I have trouble believing Perry would go to Paris. I have even more trouble believing that he would bring Gail. I have even more trouble believing that he would leave the museum in that guy's car. I can't explain how much trouble I have believing that he would take Gail on that trip. So it goes. It's difficult to see this every man taking obvious risks for someone he barely knows. These are big risks and worst, he's taking along his wife whom he just cheated on. There are ways to provide Perry with good personal reasons for his actions but this movie doesn't set them up. He is horribly naive. He needs to say smarter things so that he's not simply going along with Hector.This movie doesn't have the action to be thrilling. It's also not quite smart enough to be a good espionage drama. There are good aspects with some tension. The actors are all first rate. It could be rewritten with some better action set pieces to be exciting or it could elevate Hector's enemies to make a smart political espionage drama. It's not quite at that level."
" When a mobster finds out that his life may be in danger, he turns to desperate methods to find a way out.
",-0.6908,0.8743,2017-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Had the DVD, but never intended to watch this movie because of some of the mob reviews/parental remarks here. Gave it a chance anyways late one night out of desperation.Even the beginning scenes drew me in. What is this all about? As more of the mafia elements started to unravel, I knew then that I was hooked. The acting was not bad. The cinematography (as stated by another reviewer) was interesting. As the story progressed, I noticed that I kept wanting to see more of the drama unfold. This was definitely a good break from the clichÃ© action & remakes that's common nowadays. Many scenes here can make you angry, but they seem necessary for the background of the story. There were times you wanted Obi Wan Kenobi to pull out a light saber, but, this story teaches, that even the average human being, can sometimes do questionable actions."
" Well worth watching
",0.4588,0.9532,2017-09-04 00:00:00,7,"SPOILERS ALERT - inevitably, as this film is largely about redemption, so it is necessary to give away certain details in order to explain why. Redemption for Ewan McGregor's university professor, who has thrown his marriage into crisis through an 'indiscretion' with a student, and he is also struggling to cope with his male ego in a relationship where his wife is much more professionally successful, in her work as a barrister. Redemption for the mafia money man, who is seeking to protect his family from treachery by delivering the goods on a huge corruption scheme involving the Russian mafia and British politicians. This extrovert figure (can't imagine Ralph Fiennes carrying this one off) also recognises the fundamental decency of McGregor's character and saves his life by following a hunch (McGregor had also twice saved his). And redemption for the MI6 officer who fell afoul of his superiors because he was unable to come up with evidence to convict influential figures. How all these stories play themselves out is well worth watching."
" Excellent Realistic Espionage Thriller
",0.6249,0.7611,2017-08-21 00:00:00,10,"*** May contain spoilers *** I have enjoyed many of John Le Carres books but I have not read this one yet. This film was excellent. The acting was very realistic and believable and the cinema-photography was very beautifully done. The story was very realistic apart from making the Russians the bad guys, although in the UK at present that is kind of obligatory. For those clever clogs who say the plot was too simple with no twist, there is the twist staring you in the face if your eyes are not wide shut.The scenario was very realistic and very relevant today in the UK.In recent years it has become apparent that our government does not believe in democracy and that it is owned by several criminal factions. The main faction is the military industrial complex and another is the middle eastern oil kingdoms. The CIA recruited Tim Osman - alias Osama bin Laden and Al-Quaeda was and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the CIA with the goal of spreading civil war to every country in the world and thereby increasing arms sales and reducing the population everywhere. Of course you could not possibly depict that story in a movie and so the Russian's become the patsy. I found it very ironic that some of this movies reviewers said that having ordinary people caught up in an espionage thriller was unbelievable. The reality is that the Hollywood superhero Bond / Vin Diesel type action man hero and the associated stories are pure fantasy fiction and that espionage by its very nature is usually conducted by non-descript ordinary people. We know from history that University Professors make up a disproportionate number of these.I found the film very tense. I was caught up in the lives of the characters and I thought it was great that the British couple dragged into the plot were having marital difficulties. It showed that two self-centred people caught up in the miseries of their own relationship bubble could do extraordinary things and that they were both decent moral people despite obvious past mistakes. While this may not be a daringly new concept, it forms the foundation of any stable society.So the real moral of the film is that while official flashy government agencies have the guns, helicopters and muscle bound action man personnel, it is up to the flawed everyday average person to actually save the day."

" Lacklustre Le Carre
",0.0,0.9688,2017-03-15 00:00:00,3,"When it comes to John Le Carre film adaptation's there's sadly quite a large gulf that has developed between the great: Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy, the middle of the road: The Tailor of Panama and the lackluster: A Most Wanted Man and while last year with the overrated miniseries The Night Manager, Le Carre has found success, My Kind of Traitor is very much the lackluster Le Carre, with Susanna White's thriller failing to get the blood pumping.The good Le Carre novels and adaptation's find themselves mastering both suspense and layered plots and they're both elements amiss from White's film (and The Two Faces of January director and Drive screenwriter Hossein Amini's lifeless script) that never feels either believable enough or interesting enough to make use of a recognisable cast that all flounder with subpar material that fails to play to their individual strengths, while White who has made a career behind camera largely as a miniseries specialist, directs Le Carre's subpar material without an ounce of any real effort that hampers the film even more so.Centring around the largely chemistry free struggling couple of Ewan McGregor's Perry and Naomie Harris's Gail, who in the blink of an eye become friends with Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd's Russian Mafia accountant Dima on a European relationship saving holiday, only to find themselves quickly entrenched in a government backed mission to save Dima and his family from the big bad's his looking to rat out, Our Kind of Traitor fails to make us believe things could transpire as they do and for a film of this ilk to be so uninvolving and tiresome with a lack of any true thrills and spectacle (other than some great scenery and crisp DOP work from the ever impressive Anthony Dod Mantle), no amount of cast saving would've helped this film feel like anything more than a glorified BBC event film.Wasting a cast that could and should be doing much more and bringing to life a Le Carre story that surely ranks amongst some of his most uninspired, Our Kind of Traitor may be of some joy to the authors fervent followers and those that count BBC productions amongst their yearly calendar highlights but for the rest of us there will likely be countless other thrillers both from cinemas and the small screen that are endlessly more memorable and engaging than this instantly forgettable and seen a million times before affair.1 Â½ tennis matches out of 5"

Something like this happens to Ewan McGregors character. Someone with a past, but also someone with morals. And someone who seems to be struggling with his life, so he may be welcoming whatever gets thrown at him.This is based on a novel which I haven't read, so I can't compare those two. I can tell you that the movie is more than suspenseful enough and it seems very much rooted in reality (of course heightened at certain points of the story). There are many obstacles and you may see a lot of things coming before they happen, but the movie is played very well and is more than decent enough to enjoy"
" Probably should have been much better
",0.4404,0.6643,2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"'Our Kind of Traitor' should really have been my sort of movie. The acting talent utilised really is pretty impressive â€“ Ewan McGregor, Damian Lewis and Naomi Harris all well used to turning in great performances that can lift a film. I first became aware of this film as a 'new release' on Amazon and did wonder why I'd never heard of it before. I'm guessing it was either released straight to DVD, or had such a limited cinema release that no one really heard much about it. And for a good reason, it's pretty boring.Despite the acting talent on offer, it never really gets going. A married couple (McGregor and Harris) are on a 'second honeymoon' kind of holiday where they're trying to rekindle their marriage after he had an affair with a younger woman. Once on their travels he stays out late and gets talking (and drinking) with a particularly dodgy-looking crowd of guys (who have the word 'criminal' stamped across their foreheads, in my opinion) and end up somehow being 'witnesses' for their good character during an upcoming deal for political asylum with MI6. No, seriously.Apart from how generally ludicrous this sounds, I had two problems with the story â€“ firstly I felt there wasn't much motivation for Ewan McGregor's character to actually hook up with these dodgy guys â€“ an action that clearly went against his attempts to patch things up with his wife. And, secondly, the main 'villain' (I'll leave it up to you to decide if they're villains or not) keeps referring to McGregor as 'Professor.' Yes, Ewan plays a university lecturer and admits this early on. It's just the guy uses it almost as a put-down, making 'the professor's' compliance in his business even less likely.Okay, so it's a little far-fetched, but Star Wars never won any points for its 'realism.' I can suspend my disbelief if what I'm seeing is vaguely interesting. And this isn't. It's not bad, it just should be more due to its actors, yet it comes across as a 'made-for-TV' movie that takes way too long to get going. It's not all bad â€“ Damien Lewis seems to be revelling in playing a slightly smarmy MI6 agent. If you're a fan of his then you'll get a little more out of this film, otherwiseÂ… there's better on offer."
" Gripping
",0.0,0.6369,2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"This is a proper screen adaptation of a John le Carre novel. If you're looking for a film to watch or rent, this is a good one. It tells the story of an ordinary British couple who, while on holiday, get caught up in a drama involving a member of the Russian mafia. This follows them after the holiday, and it turns into a terrifying adventure.I thought the movie was gripping. There were many scenes that had me at the edge of my seat. The scenes were set in various locations around Europe and the rest of the world. I disagree with those who say the plot developments were not credible.I think this movie is a little under-rated with it's current IMDb score. It's worth about 7.5."
" A poor spy film that is just so boring
",-0.7262,0.9623,2017-01-28 00:00:00,3,"I like a good spy film so I thought I would give this film a watch and as you can probably tell by the summary I found this film incredibly boring as dull. The premise of this film sees a married couple on holiday get approached by a Russian gangster who wants him and his family moved to England to be protected in exchange for secrets. Ewan McGregor plays a professor in the film that is approached by this gangster and he does an alright job in this film. He gives as good a performance as he can but his character is just so dull, there is nothing interesting about him in this film and I will be surprised if you end up caring about him in this film. Stellan skaarsgaard plays the Russian gangster in this film and his performance is very mixed, overall I thought he did an alright job but at times he is just so over the top and cartoony with allot of his performance. Damian Lewis plays the British agent in charge of this investigation and he gives the best performance In this film. I thought he added quite a bit of depth to his character in this film and I liked his line delivery as well. There are times where he comes across as over the top but he overall overcomes it and gives a decent performance. Naomi's Harris plays McGregor's wife and I think she was pretty miscast in this film, her chemistry with McGregor is just nowhere to be seen and some of her line delivery is extremely awkward especially when she has to swear. The story in this film is so convoluted and confusing that you really won't have a clue what is going on and why it is happening. Nothing about this story is interesting and you will not care enough to try and figure out what is really going on. The script has some pretty decent over the top humour in in that will actually make you chuckle in this film, but the dramatic dialogue just falls so short that as mentioned before doesn't help these characters at all. The style of this film is painfully boring, The films pacing will just add to this films flaws and make it just hard to care about. Overall I don't think anybody should watch this film because it is so boring and just not worth the 2 hours of time."
" our kind of traitor
",0.0,-0.6743,2017-01-26 00:00:00,2,"Awful movie, painful to watch. Hardly any resemblance to LeCarre's splendid book. In fact, IMO, the only decent movie that's been made from a LeCarre novel was Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy with Alec Guinness. The others were overly violent in a bid to attract the youth audience and insufficiently political.If you think that LeCarre's story is not relevant, may I remind you that at this moment we are very close to engaging in a cold war with Russia again. All it takes is one foolish word from either Trump or Putin and we will be right back where we were 50 years ago.I don't think the world of international spying is kaput. With modern technology, spying is ubiquitous."
