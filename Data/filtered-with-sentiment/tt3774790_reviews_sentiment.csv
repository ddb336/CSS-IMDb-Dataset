" My fault for watching a movie where Dane Cook is a PhD in Engineering
",-0.4019,-0.9737,2021-02-24 00:00:00,1,"I think that this movie tried to make a suspenseful sci-fi with comedy. I'm guessing that's why they cast Cook.
There is nothing funny, or suspenseful, or thrilling about this terrible story. it is written so poorly, with zero internal logic whatsoever. The characters are supposed to be experts, but they show up for the most important day of their career openly bragging about being still drunk from the night before and having just been dumped. This team is just meeting for the first time, on the first day of the 400 day mission. When team-members show immediate signs of violent psychosis, there are no policies in place to deal with it. There doesn't seem to be any plan in place to deal with anything in this universe.
The story was bad. The acting was terrible. The dialogue will make you scream at your screen.
Don't waste your time with this garbage."

My take on this is that she was in on this, the injections were fake as she never had one, the first 2 months were likely legit, the rest pre planned. The stabby parts were props which is why the bad guy stepped away and was later ""stabbed"" in the back and couldn't push harder on the rubber knife. The light was sunlight. OR... there was a planned protection hence the recorded congrats message OR the congrats message was recorded when the surface learned of the earth's fate. Too many possibilities.

" story without depth
",0.0,-0.8265,2020-02-26 00:00:00,3,"It is watchable but it is bad. Very low production values, a story without depth that does not have the ability to explore the issues of a group being closed for 400 days, and that tries to play only with uncertainty and suspense and some creepy effect. The ending is made just for confusing but without making any sense."
" The Ending That Never Was
",0.0,-0.9878,2020-01-21 00:00:00,2,"I admit, I didn't expect too much out of this but I said to myself why not? I like Brandon Routh (even thought he was underrated in Superman Returns) and I guess Dane Cook is alright too in small doses.I didn't know the other actors so I took a chance and even refrained myself from reading the reviews because I'm one of those rare birds who actually like spoilers before watching a movie. And now I wish I had read all of them cause this was excruciating.First of all, the acting is quite good and even though this is obviously a very low budget production, that doesn't bother me because I am able to take it into consideration when I judge a film.It started slowly and I didn't mind that because I still felt like we were going somewhere but then, around half way when the ""action"" (and I use the term loosely) shifted from the lone set to the outside, it all fell apart and very quickly.Without a solid story, any movie becomes tedious at best and in this case, the further along it went, the more I felt like I would be disappointed. Nothing made sense, very little was explained but by far, the worst aspect of this production is the ending.Not only did it feel like the cliffhanger of an episode from a TV series where everything is up in the air but worst of all, it's as if there is a huge chunk of the movie missing at the end. There is no conclusion, no explanation and I was left to wonder why in the name of heaven did I even bother in watching this drivel.Mind you, not every loose end has to be tied up or explained but as an audience we need some sort of satisfying resolution and this is by far one of the worst ending I've ever seen in my life. It's as if the writer/director had no idea how to finish so he simply gave up I guess telling himself that the viewers would fill in the blanks.But this is so lazy and incompetent that I felt angry I wasted my time. 2 stars is the only rating I feel this deserves because even though it showed promise at the beginning, by the end everything was ruined and if you like a movie where nothing is explained at all this might be for you but it's not for me. Not by a long shot."
" Written by a six-year-old
",0.0,-0.9267,2019-10-30 00:00:00,1,"It is impossible to know where to start when describing this utterly idiotic movie. The writer obviously has no clue whatsoever about how things work. (A drunk who freaks out over a girlfriend is fit for a simulated Mars mission? A simulated near-fatal issue during launch, as if this were a training exercise rather than a simulated flight? Being told to go to bed ten minutes into the flight? Wandering around the ship as if they had never seen it before? The head of the program threatening the careers of the astronauts a minute before they board?)Honestly, if millennials get a bad rap it if because of films like this. The writer has no knowledge about the subject matter, no understanding of adulthood, and did no homework whatsoever. How someone could ever secure a budget for this or pay for the actors, three of whom are recognizable - including the star of a hollywood blockbuster - is beyond understanding.What we have here is Ed Wood with a budget and no monsters."

" Character Study

Eventually you realize that the true experiment is what happens when a low budget film is created which takes story elements from other movies and Twilight Zone episodes to create a one-hundred minute long Twilight Zone episode that doesn't even give us the Rod Serling wrap up at the end. ""Will anyone watch till the end?"" is the real data being gathered.
Look how clever we are, we left the ending open like Tom Hanks standing at the crossroads in Castaway. Unfortunately, this movie had a simple binary choice of what really happens at the end and they chose not to tell you.

However I have seen, loved and rate in my top ten SCI FI films 2001 and had to smile when one of them is singing Daisy.I think it is basically a good film, just the ending reduces the stars from 8 to 6, I don't mind an ambiguous ending that leaves you thinking WTF. I would have liked a few more clues other than Bug discovering some kind of space dust. Probably a bit to vague for most. The hallucinations weren't explained either, they had nothing to do with what had happened outside the ship.One reviewer said that the writer should have had 400 days in prison for it, really does he/she think that was enough?"

" Killing time
",-0.6597,0.3536,2019-01-07 00:00:00,3,"Despite it not being particularly well received here, '400 Days' intrigued me with its idea and it looked and sounded like an ambitious film. The cast didn't sound like a bad one on paper either. Was really hoping that it would be better than indicated in the reviews, wanting to go against the grain with being so impressed by the idea, and that it would even be good somewhat instead of another waste of potential (having seen quite enough of those recently). Am not trying to be a snob or anything, it is just my genuine thoughts.'400 Days' sadly was exactly that, a waste of potential. A shame because when it first started it actually pleasantly surprised me, even if the production values were not exactly great. Did actually consider forgiving that, because there have been instances of production values not being great but the film succeeds in most other areas. Then '400 Days' lost its way badly, becoming the complete opposite of what promise the first part showed and with so many problems already covered very well by others. Very frustrating and borderline insulting at its worst. Am actually feeling really bad about saying this.Beginning with the good things, as said already '400 Days' started off promising. It was compelling and intriguing with an air of tense mystery about it. Parts were well shot and showed a cinematographer using techniques clearly influenced by films that were genre landmarks and ground-breaking.Also found the cast not too shabby and thought they really tried, doing what they could with material utterly beneath them.However, the low budget and rushed production does show in the production values. The film looks very drab, the sets are very simplistic, too much of the editing in the latter parts of the film is choppy and some of it even looks unfinished. The music didn't hinder the atmosphere and didn't sound cheap, but would have made much of an impression with more subtle, better balanced and less predictable sound editing. The direction is not incompetent but a case of someone biting off more than they could chew and running before walking.This is not an example of a film not trying. If anything, '400 Days' tries too hard and one respects the ambition, over-ambition in this case, more than the execution. It does completely fall apart too early, the suspense and any atmosphere completely goes and replaced by sluggish pacing, no surprises and senseless character behaviours that insult the intelligence and makes endear to the character far less to the point you can't. Parts are too expostion-heavy and the dialogue throughout is ham-handed and clunky, especially in these parts which don't say anything and sound like gibberish, and the final act fails to make sense to the point of incoherence. And yes, the worst asset is the ending, abrupt and ambiguous are understatements, in fact it is a complete non-event and with a big truck-load of questions and no answers. It gave the sense that the film was released incomplete.Overall, initially intriguing but underwhelming at the end of the day. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

But i cannot tolerate things like an open bar in that world!. Complete with music and neon signs!! Do they really have energy to spare?!!!
And why do they only want to eat those 4?! Why don't they attack one another?!
Is the meat of those 4 tastier or something?!
Seriously the last third of the movie made ZERO sense.
I give a 4 for potential only. The core idea was nice, but the execution and the end bad."

The movie was fairly simple plot wise and you can see almost all of it coming from a mile away, but there's just enough to keep you watching just to find out how it's going to end.And then, when you're just about there, the movie ends with zero closure.

" Intriguing and Frustrating
",-0.4404,-0.9325,2018-08-11 00:00:00,5,"The astronauts Theo (Brandon Routh), Emily (Caity Lotz), Dvorak (Dane Cook) and Bug (Ben Feldman) are locked in an underground facility imitating a spaceship for 400 days simulating the travel to a distant planet. The intent is to study the psychological effect caused by the long isolation period without contact or communication with the outside world. They experience hallucinations and weird noises on the outside and close to the day 400, they see a stranger in their ship. When the man flees, Theo and Bug leave the facility and they find outside world dusty, dark and desolate. They decide to walk to seek somebody and while Dvorak believes it is part of the experiment, Theo, Emily and Bug believe that something bad may happen on Earth. ""400 Days"" is an intriguing thriller with an absolutely frustrating conclusion. There are flaws in the story (how a weak man like Bug is selected for such experience is probably the worst) but in general the film builds the mystery with an increasing tension. Unfortunately the lack of conclusion is a cold shower in the viewer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Protegido: 400 Dias"" (""Protected: 400 Days"")"

Which then you start to question what's really happening to some of the characters. GREAT! This is what is keeping me watching... but that's all that happens, the story goes deeper into this rabbit hole, and then......
Nothing, absolutely nothing, all this build up of what happened, what's real what's not then, white light, literally, and credits. I sat with my jaw on the floor and said ""Are you f'ing kidding me!? You're not gonna finish?"" There is not even an ending where it could be maybe it was all a hallucination or maybe something happened to earth (which was very vague by the way) and they are screwed, and you can kinda talk it out with someone who watched it with you... nope it just went blank and didn't finish.

It is intellectually deep and does not satisfy the cookie-cutter Hollywood formula which most people need. It is a study on the ethics of psychological research. Is there a line that we as humans will not cross or will we let the events unfold in every dramatic horrifying way simply for scientific research?The movie has a logical ending and leaves everything you thought you knew about what was happening open to interpretation after the credits.

If this is 'experimental' cinema, it's a failed experiment the like of which we've never seen. Alchemy or the fountain of youth are more believable premises that this utter waste of time.Dan Cook, in particular, cements himself as a B-movie hack, playing the role of a knuckle-headed Neaderthal who somehow got picked for astronaut training. Of all the clichéd characters in the thing, his is the worst and hearkens back to the dreary days of the 70s and 80s. Equally so, I'm guessing the sets were bought at a straight to video 80s film yard sale such is their 'authenticity'.Trust me, believe the 1 or 2 star reviews. The comparisons to 'Moon' are apt.

In the last minute the director and the rest of the incompetents implicated in this pathetic attempt at storytelling just gave up and left the viewer with a whole lot of nothing when we would have taken almost anything. Nothing endings only work well if crafted by skilled storytellers. Inception had a great nothing ending. For his sake, I hope this director just ran out of money – at least that would be a reason which would compute. You're not being 'cool' 'edgy' or 'neat' by ending it this way. Netflix even got in on the scam by claiming in the description that the crew weren't sure if the 400 day test might actually be real. This was never the illusion they were dealing with.

",0.7227,0.9927,2017-10-15 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed the movie. IMO, decently acted, decent amount of suspense, a decent story in there with some imagination and suspended disbelief, and therefore it was ... a DECENT movie. If you like SyFy as much as I do, it is fair to say it was a decent PLUS movie. It was not a wasted 90 minutes of my life but it did not make me excited for a sequel either. So I decided to write a review telling you just that.. it was decent. As I wrote the review I liked the movie more and more. So if you really like SyFy please watch. I think you might be pleasantly surprised. The following ""review"" has some complementary viewing tips and hints for your increased viewing pleasure-- I hope.But first my two negatives... I agree completely with almost everyone else's reviews regarding the fact that none of these four people would EVER qualify for space travel with Disney let alone a manned mission longer than a 10 minute ride (Disneyland/World style ride remember). It is also a corporation not NASA so in reality a Disneyland analogy is better and more viable. Sorry Supes... You lost your mission status to travel to DisneySpace 2 minutes into the movie. Just suspend your disbelief on that one folks can't help you there.My second negative is that they all seemed to get very stupid at the end. Annoyingly stupid. ""OMfg... As If... Seriously people?!?!""Now my ""analysis""It was not as good a movie as it could have been because it was attempting to have a flat affect as an overall tone. Unless flat affect was truly INTENTIONAL. It had to be. This is a SyFy movie, they are not known for subtlety. So I incorporated that flat affect into my personal ""do it yourself"" ending-- as a hint (I won't tell you precisely what I think the ending was most likely just some ideas and hints for your perspective pleasure). Step one: Apply whatever level of intent to the affect of the movie in your analysis and as you watch the movie.I wouldn't want you to not watch because I spoiled it by giving you a possible ending-- so the rest of what I say will be less direct.Step two: Do not be too harsh. I am mainly writing this review because I think people in the reviews seemed to be expecting something they shouldn't from a SyFy movie and therefore are being a little more harsh than I WAS. Remember I enjoyed the movie. I want you to enjoy it too.Step three: Try not to get annoyed with the ending. Try not to assume everything is a trope or cliché.After I got done being annoyed about the ending. I thought about the way the story WAS told and decided NOT to assume it is was just a bunch of tropes and clichés. Then I decided I did really like the ending. I also ended up liking the movie more after some thought. Even further liking it more as time went and I wrote this long freaking review.Step four: Consider the four main characters together and apart. I may be giving it way too much credit but I think that the way the four main characters were handled was on purpose and you were not meant to see too deeply into any one particular character-- EXCEPT.Step five: Unless you try not to let it-- the ending will blow your mind and not in a good way. So withhold gnashing your teeth until you at least try to re-frame your interpretation of the movie and characters. Which is what I think those ""open endings"" are meant to do. Make you rethink everything. To that end.. I offer these final two hints for your consideration. As far as endings there are really only two maybe three truly possible ""meta-endings"" (multiverse not withstanding). If you use the hints below as a basis point.Hint one: either all four did lose their minds OR the two that were NOT having hallucinations did NOT lose their minds. Kind of difficult for everyone to lose their minds with a cross section of four relatively healthy fit young adults. Except for during very severe oxygen deprivation, not everyone is going to have severe symptoms. My understanding is they all had increasingly sustained and also slowly reduced O2 levels over time. Realistically the final scenes are not really something you can ""hallucinate"" further it is even less likely to be a shared hallucination, especially on that scale. +++ Spoiler +++If you parse the last few minutes out you will also realize... In all probability the message that plays at ""end"" or if you would prefer the first second of their 401 day is an automated message. Especially since this executive likes his briefings at 10:00 am. I also seriously doubt they would be cheering at least two deaths of the ""team"" (mission or control) should it have been an elaborate scenario.So if you use my ""analysis"" it boils down to just a few basic possible endings. I have my two favorite options. I will leave you to figure your endings out for yourself.Understand I love all types of SyFy movies. So I would recommend watching it if you just like SyFy movies enough to suspend ""reality"" for a DECENT movie, with decent acting, story, suspense, and a pretty decent do it yourself ending."
" I have wasted a hour and a half of my life and i will never get it back!!
",-0.5837,-0.4545,2017-09-16 00:00:00,1,Do not watch this movie! The worst movie I have ever seen!! Why waste good money on making this film? there are children hungry somewhere who could use the money you spilled on this.. I have seen blackheads removal videos on Youtube which are far better then this shame... shame... shame... shame...
" You do know this is just a simulation, don't you?
",0.0,0.9533,2017-08-31 00:00:00,8,"I'm glad I didn't buy into the numerous negative reviews and purchased this film that seemed to have a very intriguing plot. I must say that I even got much more than I expected. 400 Days convinces with a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere, four distinguished and interesting main characters and a challenging plot that doesn't give you all the answers. The movie actually takes its audience serious and requests multiple viewing and the use of your brain. The number of analyses, questions and theories around the movie on the internet only underlines the film's intellectual touch.Why did the movie get so many negative reviews then? Of course, some people might just not like it. The film doesn't have any stunning special effects like so many other science-fiction films. The film didn't have a big budget and the settings aren't much developed. While the actors and actresses are doing a solid job in my book, there isn't a particularly outstanding performance and you obviously won't find any big names involved here.However, I suspect that most reviewers rated this movie down because they literally didn't understand it. You can identify those people by reading sentences like ''The movie didn't have a proper ending!'', ''How is it possible that the Moon got destroyed?'' and ''The behavior of the characters doesn't make any sense!''. The movie does have a clear ending that makes you think and that makes sense once you really think about it. The explanation that the Moon got destroyed doesn't have anything to do with what's really going on. And the characters react very emotionally because three of them are receiving drugs and because specific planned events are supposed to trigger their exaggerated reactions. I won't give any more information than this and there might be different similar interpretations of the film but it's important to understand the movie by looking at its whole essence and the things that are said in the beginning instead of taking every statement each character makes literally.If you are ready to explore a science-fiction movie with an experimental, intelligent and interpretative plot, you will be surprised by 400 Days. If you are looking for a spectacular science- fiction movie with a big budget and perfectly clear answers, you should better watch another shallow Star Wars or Star Trek sequel or stick to popcorn cinema fur juvenile minds such as Guardians of the Galaxy."
" Interesting watch!
",0.4574,0.9476,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"This is an interesting movie with an amazing cast. A lot of reviews on here indicate that the movie lacked a real ending. I recommend watching it for yourself, and getting your own take on it. What I personally got out of it is that the whole thing was, unknown by the four astronauts, ""reality TV"" for 400 days, an extreme, psychological Big Brother. Cameras recording them 24/7, even night vision cameras on the ""planet surface"". At the end, the congratulating video with the applause, then the hatch opening, with bright light shining down at the end after all of that primitive darkness. This movie will make you think, I highly recommend watching it!"
" Why did I waste my time with this?
",-0.4215,0.7865,2017-01-24 00:00:00,2,"Started out with promise. I get that there is a budget, but come on, even the people at the initial news conference didn't even look like reporters. Where's the facility that was monitoring them? They're out in a field in the middle of nowhere... right OK. The characters were supposed to be picked for possible astronauts.. they freak out when they are drinking recycled water. At that point I knew this was going to be crap. I fast forwarded to some of the later scenes and watched the ending. Glad I was ironing my shirts while watching this.. it wasn't a total waste of my time. All the reviews have pretty much got it right. Some director has copied so many elements from other films trying to make their own ""masterpeice'"
" Not bad at all
",0.431,0.9818,2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Difficult to interpret the second half of the film as most seem to have differing opinions. Anything from script time restrictions, left open for a sequel, rushed production, poor script writing etc etc. But I've a slightly different opinion.First off, undoubtedly a ""frustrating"" ending which would not fail to leave anyone with unanswered questions. And certainly unanswered questions such as the injections and how the mouse would have gained entry etc. But to be honest, in my personal opinion I think the script writer was trying to be rather clever in using the second half of the film's script to underline the major psychological affects of such a long space mission in such relative confined and isolated conditions.And I'm left feeling the outside scene's were more a kind of visual metaphor on the psychological effects the crew were suffering from. As quite frankly, those scenes otherwise served no purpose and this film could easily have simply been a 50 minute drama instead, so those outside town scenes must have had a deeper meaning many may well have missed. I mean, when the hatch opened at the end, clearly there was strong light entering so maybe as said, a visual metaphor on the psychological effects that if ending the film with a welcoming committee outside the hatch, would have made the outside town scenes even more frustrating and pointless to some viewers I'm feeling.And as for the crew, I'm feeling that maybe there was only ever really 2 of them and maybe the injections were possibly an hallucinogenic drug to help give a false impression of extra crew. But hay, unless the writers care to explain the script I guess we will never know for sure."
