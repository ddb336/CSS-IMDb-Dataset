" Underrated movie. Great setup for the story.
",0.6249,0.9342,2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,"In my opinion this movie as a standalone is very average, but it is setting up the story for Civil War, Black Panther, Ragnarok and the Endgame movies. Its full of easter eggs and your typical Marvel humor.
As a fan of the MCU you will love it but you have to watch all MCU movies to fully understand the grand sceme."

" NAME OF THE AVENGERS SEQUENCE
",0.0,0.1119,2021-03-14 00:00:00,9,"The San Diego Comic-Con is bringing us incredible revelations and after the DC announcement of the Superman and Batman movie Marvel did not lag behind and announced the title of the sequel to The Avengers, will be Avengers: Age of Ultron.For this ad, Marvel aired a teaser in which a red and gold armor (presumed to be Iron Man) appears in the beginning being constantly beaten by something invisible and as background the main characters' lines in the first film stating that the super team is not able to act together. It ends with Bruce Banner's phrase that the team is a ticking time bomb.After that tense moment the camera comes close to the helmet that it is picking up and we realize that it is actually Ultron and not Iron Man. Even catching Ultron is smiling sinister. For those who don't know Ultron is a villain who was created by Ant-Man scientist Henry Pym.In Marvel's Age of Ultron miniseries, Ultron dominates the Earth and shapes the world according to his wishes, and the only way to stop it is to go back in time and stop Pym from creating it. The feature (now titled) Avengers: Age of Ultron will premiere in May 2015. From CULTZONE Portal M.D. 2013-07-21"
" Vastly underrated in the MCU
",0.0,-0.2631,2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"I just watched this movie for the third time. I will say that this movie is packed so full of references, Easter eggs and set ups for future films, that it's difficult not to miss something."

" Avengers: Age of Ultron 2015 Review
",0.0,0.9808,2021-02-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie deserves more credit then it's given.
Coming off of the first Avengers film, sure this is a step down, but Age of Ultron is still full of solid action, good humor, and amazing superhero synergy.
Even with the new additions, Paul Bettanys Vision, Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff, and James Spaders Ultron, this movie does an amazing job of meshing all these new characters in with the old.
Ultron in this movie felt like another Mandarin (Iron Man 3). But in my opinion, the change of character and James Spaders voice acting works amazingly for this character and makes him extremely memorable.My only complaint would be Aaron Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver, he's definitely nothing to write home about. His character is extremely lackluster and only used to serve a minor part of the plot at the end (not talking about the implications that come from WandaVision), and when compared to Evan Peters Quicksilver from the Fox X-Men movies: it's a major step down."
" Overly underrated
",0.0,0.9173,2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,The most logical villain topped of with entertaining action with great acting. Truly a marvel masterpiece
" The movie that killed the MCU for me
",-0.6705,0.8125,2021-02-06 00:00:00,2,"I remember the trailer for 'Age of Ultron' so well. This movie had such incredible potential. The preview portends world-shattering cataclysm, a foe so great that the Avengers are brought to their knees and forever changed. Even still, the music sends chills down my spine.But I also watch that trailer now and I'm just angry. Because AoU wasted all its potential. We got a fun party scene, one cool moment near the end, and all we had to give in return was 2 hours of our lives that we'll never get back.In the opening scene, we see a moment where time slows as the Avengers charge through the forest, and we see them all lined up, hard-boiled determination on their faces. We're supposed to cheer, ""Yeah! Heroes!"" I groaned.Black Widow is reduced to a damsel in distress. A scene in which she opens up about her past may be an attempt to show her displaying some human vulnerability to her comrades, but instead it crosses a line into misogyny as she wails about how being rendered sterile makes her a monster.Early trailers showed us Iron Man's Hulkbuster Armor, and promised the fight of the century, but it's over so quickly that it's terribly anticlimactic. I'd rather it not have been in the film at all than to have seen the potential wasted as it was.The entire scene of Thor receiving his vision about Midgard is so out of place, disrupting the flow, that it, too, would have been better off cut from the movie.Film adaptations often change details about one thing or another to better fit a character, place, or thing into the narrative as it's being spun. The Maximoff twins, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, see their identities altered from the comics; in 'Age of Ultron,' they are from the same small fictional country in Eastern Europe where key portions of the movie are set. I suppose there are worse alterations one could make, yet at the same time - especially seeing as the twins joined forces with the Nazi-linked HYDRA, while in the comics they are Jewish, the children of Magneto? This change feels like erasure.The movie also had an opportunity to force big changes upon the Avengers. The trailer informed us in no uncertain terms of the possibility of someone dying. And, well, that's what we got - but it's Pietro Maximoff, a character that was just introduced and who we know nothing about, that gets axed. Missed opportunity much, Marvel?These are the things that have stuck with me about 'Age of Ultron' after 6 years. Almost everything else about the movie was forgettable enough that it left no impression at all. Meeting Hawkeye's family as the Avengers retreat to their farm would have made his death all the more impactful, but no, you can't shuttle a major star from the franchise that quickly. Introducing Vision into the MCU didn't nearly feel like the ""eureka!"" moment it should have been. In 2015, 'Age of Ultron' should have been Marvel's biggest movie ever. Instead, it's almost certainly their weakest.My enthusiasm for Marvel's cinematic endeavors effectively ended with the gross failure of 'Age of Ultron.' That's not to say that they can't still make good movies: 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a treasure; against all odds, 'Black Panther' is a genuinely fantastic film. But barring extraordinary exceptions, I just don't care any more. I still haven't seen the Thanos films, and I don't plan on it. If movie theaters ever open again, I don't particularly intend on shelling out cash for a Marvel movie. AoU could have been a movie to foster excitement for years to come; instead, it smothered what little I had left.I said this elsewhere 5.5 years ago, and I still mean it: in hindsight, 'Age of Ultron' probably peaked with the New York Times review whose byline read, in part, ""None of this matters."""
" Worst Marvel Movie (6.0)
",-0.3182,0.7943,2021-01-29 00:00:00,6,"I guess this is the most disliked movie among marvel movies. The whole movie seems ridiculous and unnecessary to me. I wish Marvel never made a movie like this of course had some gains like Wanda and Vision, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a pretty boring movie.The effects are bad, the battle scenes are bad, the whole Sokovia episode is pretty unnecessary for some reason I can't like this movie and finally, I wish Quicksilver hadn't died and he had a good place in the Marvel world, I think it would have gotten a lot of attention."
" ICONIC
",0.0,0.9117,2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"It is a brilliant movie. It has some iconic scenes, the action sequences are awesome, the dialogues are very nicely written. I would say it is not as good as the other avengers but still it is pretty cool."
" An enjoyable ride
",0.4404,0.8579,2021-01-18 00:00:00,7,"Cool seeing them all together again, even if I didn't massively enjoy it. It's good, nothing more or less in my opinion.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' isn't too far off 2012's 'The Avengers', especially in terms of how I fell about it. I definitely wanted more from both, yet they are still satisfying superhero action flicks. I'd rank this narrowly below the aforementioned.Robert Downey Jr. felt a little flat to me as Iron Man - he still has a decent amount of moments, just not as many as you get in his individual films. All the others continue to entertain to an equally suitable level, I didn't overly like the characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but I also don't have any noteworthy negatives about them. The story between Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo didn't do much for me either.With that noted, it is still an enjoyable ride through the 141 minute run time. The ending is intriguing, interested to see where that goes - I have a minor inkling about the mid-credits scene, given all the internet attention that has had - even for someone like me who knows very little overall."
" Underrated
",0.0,0.7939,2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,I enjoy this one more than the first one both 10/10 movies. I don't understand the hate its not the best MCU film or even the best Avengers film but it definitely isn't as bad as everyone says it is.
" Loved it
",0.5994,0.9802,2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,This is one of my comfort films and I absolutely love it. Every film made by Marvel is always guaranteed a pretty much success and this is very good and I love that a lot. I highly recommend watching this in The Avengers series
" Good movie, missed opportunities
",0.5106,0.9844,2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,"The MCU continues to pump out great individual installments that all hurt the potential of the franchise as a whole. This was a good movie. Very enjoyable. Not as epic, fun, or funny as its predecessor but still a great ride. But it was filled with missed opportunities. Phil Coulson should have been reintroduced aboard the helicarrier, which would have freed future writers to include him in the movies and would have reinvigorated fans of Agents of SHIELD. They also could have brought in Quake to destroy Sokovia in the air, but I'll grant that might have been a little too deus ex machina. At the very least, I would have loved to see the entire Agents of SHIELD cast cameo in their quinjet. It wouldn't detract from the film. People who haven't seen the show would just take them as random anonymous SHIELD agents. It would be an easy Easter egg to pull off. Quicksilver absolutely shouldn't have been killed off. We never had enough time to know and love him, meaning his death was without emotional impact. And furthermore, it was done late in the show and the scene didn't even capitalize on it. At the very least they should have made it more climactic. Why was Rhodey randomly back to his War Machine suit after Iron Man 3 made a big deal about rebranding him as Iron Patriot? Why was the Iron Legion suddenly back at full strength after Tony made such a big deal about destroying it? Minor continuity errors aside, it was a good movie. It just could have been better."
" Really Good, Very Underated
",0.4927,0.8991,2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,Avengers Age Of Ultron is considered as one of the worst entries in the MCU but I think that this film is very interesting and intriguing. The film had a very cool and intelligent storyline and the chemistry between the characters was really funny.I also liked how Joss Whedon took characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow and gave them more of a backstory which made the characters more interesting.The only thing I don't like about this film is that Ultron didn't really have anything to be evil about but he isn't the worst villain that has been introduced into the franchise so it didn't really put me off from the film.
" Mindless action and CGI
",-0.4404,0.7783,2021-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Age of Ultron has a few things going for it, the acting is fairly strong and the battle sequences fun but pointless. It's definitely one of the weaker Marvel films.The plot is very simple with little depth and extremely forgettable, there seems to be just action scenes for the sake of looking cool instead of furthering the plot, essentially when you've seen Iron man and other Avengers films you've seen it all before.5/10: An average villain, lack of plot and overuse of CGI make this an average film at best."
" The Avengers:Issue 2.
",0.0,0.7184,2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"During the break I had from watching the MCU between The Avengers and Captain America: Civil War, (2012 & 2016-both also reviewed) this was the main entry I read that people had problems with. Catching up on the issues I missed in those years on Disney+,I got set to witness the age of Ultron.View on the film:Printing his final Marvel issue, writer/director Joss Whedon is joined by Guardians of the Galaxy (2014-also reviewed) cinematographer Ben Davis,and displays a winning eye for taking the action set-pieces in a increasingly ambitious direction, spread across the screen from the thrilling opening being staged as if it is one-shot.Fighting with the studio for ""The Farm"" sequence to be included, Whedon blends the flawless glossy CGI Action of CBM with stylish whip-pans bouncing on The Avengers disagreements over how to take on Ultron.Expanding the panels from the original The Avengers, the screenplay by Whedon makes the arrival of Ultron, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver (played by the excellent trio James Spader, Elizabeth Olsen & Aaron Taylor-Johnson, all of whom bring a pulpy menace to the baddies role) feel like a natural fit to the MCU, thanks to the powers of the evil trio, making The Avengers have to question the reality of what they see and hear.Continuing on from some of the themes touched upon in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014-also reviewed), Whedon wraps his zany quips with a explosive threat from Ultron, who reveals to The Avengers that the days when they could take down one big End Of Level Boss are long gone,thanks to Ultron spreading his tentacles deep into the system, even into the very foundation of The Avengers."
" Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Review - 8.3/10
",0.0,0.0338,2020-12-12 00:00:00,8,"This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise."
" Worst film ever.
",-0.6249,-0.6779,2020-12-09 00:00:00,1,"This film was so bad. I felt like washing my tongue with fairy liquid to clean my tongue from ever even saying the name of this movie. It was the worst film I had ever seen next to Twilight, absolute abysmal. The worst of the worst films it was so abysmal that one would even consider watching a film rated 0.5 out of 10. The overall development of the villain in the film was underwhelming. No real build up and no nothing. Throw it into the deepest part of a black hole. If you liked it then throw yourself there with the film. A poor follow up from the acclaimed Avengers film. Absolutely pathetic. A sadistic piece of monstrosity the likes of which will never be seen again. Of there was half a star I would do it. However there isn't. Unfortunately this garbage leads to some of the best films of all time. So you kinda have to watch it. It's like having a husband/wife who doesn't do anything but you are kinda messed because you said yes on the marriage day. So you kinda have to stick with them. Treat this vomit the same. A mandatory nonsense that you kinda have to watch."
" The best of Age of Ultron
",0.6369,0.9973,2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"Avengers Age of Ultron is a really great film. Watching this movie, I enjoyed how everything worked together to bring the audience such an interesting and action-packed film. The special effects were spectacular especially during certain scenes like when the Avengers are fighting the two twins, the battle against Ultron, and of course when the heroes use their awe-inspiring abilities. Humor and overshadowing also had a large importance as well.
The character plot of Wanda and Quicksilver is also very interesting. The growth of these two characters over the course of the movie really shows how much thought and effort the directors put into making the film seem real. Wanda and Quicksilver start out as two of the main antagonists against the Avengers but through a course of events, the two become the heroes at the end of the movie actually working with the Avengers to battle Ultron and his monstrous duplicates of himself. In the beginning of the movie, Wanda is responsible for defeating all of the Avengers at once by using mind control and manipulation which are some of her many acquired powers from being experimented on by Hydra. Eventually she and Quicksilver decide to change their motives and actually become powerful allies that help the Avengers. In the end of the movie Wanda becomes an Avenger after the death of her brother who sacrifices himself to save Hawkeye. Quicksilver goes from being the guy to severely injure Hawkeye to actually sacrificing his own life to save him. Another thing that I enjoyed in this movie was the special effects. The entire movie was filled with special effects.
Everything looked so real and it was easy to get lost in such a franchise of a move. Humor also had a big role in making this film as great as it is. For example, when Thor taunted everyone with his magical hammer. There were a lot of jokes and lightness added to the film which otherwise would have been too serious to be watched by younger audiences. Forecasting had a huge importance in this movie as it predicted the events of the last movies of Infinity War and End Game. I found it particularly interesting that Captain America decided not to pick up Mjolnir even when most thought it was evident that he was incapable of doing so. As this shows that he may indeed wield this powerful weapon in the future. He did in fact wield the hammer in End Game and this shows that this movie was foretelling that it might be possible for this event to occur in the early stages of the Avengers movies.
One point I found quite humorous was when Vision, who was just created, lifts the hammer that no one can pick up except Thor. He says there may be no way to get the Avengers to trust him but, then easily picks up the hammer that only worthy people are given the privilege to use. Even the other Avengers except Thor and Captain America are not worthy to wield this special weapon, but he can with ease. This shows how worthy he truly he is despite his comment. Another aspect of the movie found particularly entertaining is when Ultron has unintentionally revealed his evil intentions and even the twins who are still bad at this point, are against him as well. In the end, all of these factors for me really made the movie worth watching."
" The most important film in MCU
",0.2716,-0.9322,2020-12-02 00:00:00,8,"As I was watching this movie today, I realized it's one of the most important film in mcu. It has tons of elements that are used heavily in future MCU films, egFleshing out Hawkeye°In this film we get to see the other side of Hawkeye, we learn about his family, who would played a vital role to his character's dark turn in Endgame.°This movie also solidifies his relationship with Black Widow which makes her demise in endgame even more impactful.°He also inspired Wanda to shake off her past and become an Avenger.
The arising tension between Steve and Tony° Things started to get sour between Steve and Tony, after him and Bruce accidentally created Ultron and also Vision. And the destruction of Sokovia at the end of the movie is also one of the main reason for the Sokovia Accords, which are all part of the reason that split the superheroes in two sides in CW.
Intro of Scarlett Witch and Vision°Vision and Scarlett are both introduced in this film, and they both would go on and become crucial members of the Avengers.Thanos had enough° The events of this film upset Thanos so much that he decided to ""do it himself"" which foreshadows the event of Infinity War.
Avengers as a unit°It's also the first appearance of the Avengers functional as a team. They're not just meeting and building the team like in the first Avengers, they aren't split like in Civil War and Infinity War or broken like in Endgame. They're just out there taking on bad guys, hanging out, and fighting evil robots.
Hulk/Bruce banner story arc°Bruce Banner started having problems transforming into the Hulk in this movie which keeps recurring in Infinity War, until ultimately resolved at Endgame.°Hulk buster armor°At the end of this film, Hulk left on the quinjet which from there, you know, Ragnorak.
Wakanda/ Black panther tease°Klaw is first introduced in this film, he would go on to become one of Black panther's main villain. Wakanda and vibranium are mentioned as well.
Black widow's arc°Flashback scenes of Black Widow's years of training might be further explored in the her upcoming solo movie.Ragnarok:°Heimdall first teases Ragnarok and the fact they will lose in Thor's vision, which prompted him to fly back home to Asgard.
Ironman to save everyone°The visions of defeat he saw in this film haunt him, but he was, in the end, able to use that fear to defeat Thanos in Endgame, thus saving everyone.
°Captain almost picking up Mjolnir.°The first mention of the word ""Endgame"".
At the time of its release it was met with mixed reviews mostly because it was too muddy, yeah it had to to tell its own story, all while setting up the next four years of Marvel films. This movie deserve nothing but our utmost respect. 🙌"
" I think I liked it?
",0.4215,0.8884,2020-11-17 00:00:00,7,"Age of Ultron is a bit of a weird movie for me to talk about, due to the fact that I actually don't know if I liked it or not. I do think it is a good movie though, I'm just not sure if it was my cup of tea. As in the previous Avengers movie, the main attraction of the movie is the interactions between the heroes, and I greatly enjoyed all the dialogue driven scenes. I also like that this movie focuses more on exploring different characters and give them more depth, even though I don't find the new characters all that interesting. My big issue with this movie is that it feels a little too much like a compilation of setups and explanations, whic only exist to set up future movies. Some of this has to do with the somewhat boring plot, which only somewhat touches on new elements, the slightly messy pacing, and the new themes that felt a little undeveloped. The movie is fairly well directed, albeit not spectacularly so. The villain is alright, and I like how he is a portrayal of Starks darker side, though he was a little boring. The climax is also fine, even though it is another case of the world being destroyed if the heroes fail. Overall, this movie has flaws, and I don't know if I enjoyed watching it, but it is undoubtedly a good movie, and that's what matters the most I think."
" Meh
",-0.0772,0.7459,2020-11-08 00:00:00,7,"This is one of my least favorite Marvel movies. Even so, it's not terrible. It's got some great moments and a convincing villain."
" Worst Avenger film in quadrilogy
",-0.6249,-0.9212,2020-10-29 00:00:00,2,"When I saw the trailers for this film, I was so pumped to see this film going in that type of direction. I knew it would have some funny moments, but this film was going to be very serious. But what I got... was garbage fire of a movie. This film isn't what I expected. I was expecting something similar to the first Avengers film. But what I got was a wildly exaggerated comedy where I can't even take the villain seriously. My main problem is Ultron. Ultron is a robot who happens to be evil in ONLY 5 MINUTES. In other media such as comics, he was created and, over time, became the villain I KNOW AND LOVE. But this film makes him say ew and wants to believe he is a good villain. The worst part is that acts such comedic moron. Seriously his behavior is so childish. Ultron is a robot who should NOT make those stupid jokes. He should be severe, like what the trailers have put up. Everyone was expecting to destroy the world, but WE NEVER got an excellent reason, Avengers Earths' mightiest heroes did such a perfect example with that, and I FEEL like watching that show than watching THIS FILM again. And they're so much studio interference in this that I swear Joss Whedon being an idiot saying yes to all that nonsense. Its a novelty film. Yes, the actors did such a good job, and I love each of their performances, but they could go so far. With a script they have, I bet it was good, but they rewrote it to make it a comedy of this. And man, the comedy.... was not even funny. The romance wasn't even established at all in either in the previous films. Man, I wish the Russo brothers could give us this film instead of Whedon. Because apparently, Whedon is a moron. This is by far the worst MCU film I have seen, and I know there are some worst than this, but this TO ME is the worst Avengers film in the quadrilogy. 2/10"
" Bigger and dumber than the previous one, but still a lot of fun, and even a bit better than I remember.
",0.8201,0.9773,2020-10-20 00:00:00,6,"I remember finding Ultron very annoying and the pacing very rushed, but now I relly enjoyed him and the pacing, while still rushed, flowed a lot better.The biggest problems are that the third act is a bit hard to follow and, worst of all, the stupid Hulk and Natasha romance. What were they thinking?However, it also has some of my favorite MCU moments. The party sequence is amazing. Just the Avengers hanging out and being friends is wonderful to see. Hawkeye steals the show and becomes a much more interesting character. And the nightmare sequences are honestly terrifying.It's messy, but more consistently enjoyable than I first gave it credit for."
" Better than Avengers 1
",0.4404,-0.7391,2020-10-19 00:00:00,9,"I feel AAOU was a better movie than its first. Visually and story wise it out beats A1 by 69%.The movie is about a killer robot created by the ""good"" guy who is having traumatic episodes since A1. He builds an AI who wants to be the saviour of this ugly earth by giving it a gift of destruction.Cap: Was good. Shown he is a leader. OP is some places.Iron man: an immature jerk he caused ultron and didn't get punished.Hulk and widow: sissy Black widow subplotThor: had good fight scenes but was a side character at best.Ultron: is nothing like the comics. He is more like a evil clown robot without make up.Hawkeye: they could utilize this character but they wasted him instead.Quicksilver and the witch: I thought QS was the coolest and best of the two. Sad he didn't see it coming. The Witch is alright.Overall its a fun superhero flick. Like many mcu movies before it has plot holes and unanswered question such as Vision lifting up Thor's hammer. They never purely explained it.from start to creating ultron felt rushed. Its basically the movie starts, Stark creates ultron and ultron arrives. I didn't like it. There was no build up.Verdict: its just an mcu movie, but it was a fun movie nevertheless."
" A Rather Disappointing Marvel Movie Let Down By Bizarre Plot Insertions, And Poor Character Development
",-0.7003,0.953,2020-10-08 00:00:00,6,"Pros:
1. James Spaders' (Ultron) voice-acting performance, and Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/ Iron Man), Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/ Hulk), and Scarlett Johansson's (Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow) performances are fantastic.
2. The CGI and practical effects look great, and are perfectly meshed together.
3. Most of the jokes, particularly between the Avengers, are set-up well and produce many laughs.
4. The set and costume design are mesmerising in their creation and scope.
5. The theme of humans messing around with nature is well-handled and timely, especially as we're seeing an increase in genetic engineering.
6. The score, though not as impressive as other Marvel movies, does it's job at fomenting an action-packed and adventurous atmosphere.Cons:
1. The recurring joke about Captain America/ Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) opposing cursing is just unfunny and pointless.
2. The romance between Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff feels wholly forced, unnatural,and underdeveloped.
3. The final fight feels incredibly stale and flat as it involves a hoard of CGI robots getting destroyed.
4. The character of Pietro Maximoff/ Quicksilver is nowhere near fleshed-out enough, so his death falls resoundingly flat."
" The weakest of the Avenger films
",-0.5106,0.9309,2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"After the first excellent Avengers film, this was the first major misstep of the franchise. The plot of artificial intelligence turning against its human creators is such a dull and tired trope. Were there no better ideas pitched for this film?I have never really warmed to the character of Vision; all I do is miss Jarvis.The Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff romantic subplot came out of nowhere and felt forced and lifeless as a result.The best thing to come out of this film is the introduction of Scarlet Witch, who I think Elizabeth Olsen plays very well, despite her obvious weakness for adopting accents."
" Not enjoyable at all
",-0.3412,0.8271,2020-09-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie makes the first one look good. The only good thing is James Spader is good. The plot sucks, like all avenger movies they are extremely overated."

" One of the more weaker mcu films
",-0.4927,0.9531,2020-09-08 00:00:00,7,It is a good film but compared to the other mcu movies. It is one of the weaker ones. The story is average and the screenplay is pretty slow at points.

The initial assault on the castle, the mysterious new superpowered people, the secret plot, the fight between Hulk and Iron Man, the creation of Vision - these are all great elements that propelled the plot along. However, Ultron himself is just too boring despite the charisma of his voice actor, and his robot army is expendable metal. This made the excitement just fade."
" Avengers: Age of Ultron
",0.0,0.9995,2020-08-03 00:00:00,5,"Avengers: Age of Ultron, directed by Joss Whedon, was surprisingly underwhelming. With all the hype around this film, Joss Whedon did his best to give us a great sequel to Marvel's: Avengers, with some solid character moments and ideas, but this essentially felt like a rushed out, second part of the first installment, while also creating so much exposition for what's to come. It sucks that this film has such a huge play in the overall concept of the saga because, it's massively overstuffed with messy subplots, and underdeveloped characters. The pacing of the film was very choppy, due to the extended amount of content that was cut in the editing room. The way each scene tied into eachother, felt real lose, and you can sense that they cut out some key moments that could've pieced together their scenes better.With this being more of a story-driven narrative, I needed more than just another premise we've seen before. Whedon and the creative team incorporated too much filler, and because of that, you start to feel the run time as the film progresses. Whedon tried to weave in the same tones as the first film, but due to everything being botched together, the tones didn't flow nearly as good as the first installment. The way Whedon and the team structured this film, they set themselves up to be nit picked all day long, with one of the biggest comic book type films the MCU has put out. They tried to involve more stakes, but there wasn't too much of a wow factor.You come to these films to grow with these characters, and to enjoy their chemisty, mixed with their banter, and you get that here, but there wasn't too much focus or development with any of out main avengers, besides Hawkeye. Whedon and the team dropped the ball this time with balancing the characters. In the first installment, everyone had a purpose, and fulfilled it to almost every level; here, they are all doing their own things, setting up for what's to come in the next phase of the MCU, instead of keeping this narrative as tight as possible, while subtly setting things up. Robert Downey Jr. still puts on a fantastic performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man, continuing to get good layers, but his character arch is a mixed bag. He's such a great character for his wits, and leadership skills, but he starts to become more and more arrogant, and independent. Chris Evans continues his admirable performance as Steve Rogers/Captain America, while starting to get comfortable with taking charge, brewing up great development between Tony and himself. Chris Hemsworth is all over the place in this film. Strangely, he felt shadowed at times when everyone was together, other than his developing bond with Captain America, but when he had his character moments, it was strictly exposition. Mark Ruffalo returns as Bruce Banner/Hulk, and his character arch ran the same lines as Thor. They start to develop Banner's relationship with Romanoff, and I'm 50/50 with the concept. It's a good grounding for Hulk, but then it just gives Scarlett Johansson another reason to be a flirt. One of the best things about this film, was Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. We finally get more background on him, after three films, and I welcomed that with open arms; He's just a likable character! He has this great humanized aspect, that helps create a nice bond with the audience. Another intelligent, and entertaining addition to the film was Paul Bettany as Vision! For starters, his practical look was amazing! Bettany brings this tremendous wit to the character, while easily being one of the strongest! My only issue with the character, I just wish we got a little more on him, and from him. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as QuickSilver was fine, with some decent potential, but he was almost illegally underdeveloped. I enjoyed the addition of Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda more, being more entertaining, and a lot more powerful, but just like QuickSilver, she was underdeveloped as well. I tried really hard to like James Spader as Ultron, but I just couldn't do it. I appreciate that Whedon and the team tried to make him outside of the box, with a clever back story approach, but with his character being poorly written, with an unoriginal motive, he was just wasted potential as a villain. You can tell Spader had his fun with the character, but he didn't bring a whole lot of tention to any scenes that he was in, being pretty dimwitted, and underdeveloped.The screenplay had it's moments of success, but because of the premise being overcrowded, nothing was able to flow together all that well. Joss Whedon upped the dosage of cheesy jokes, and just like the writting, the jokes were hit and miss.The action is one of the standouts of the film. With it being handled by Joss Whedon, you know it's going to be well shot, high octane, and big fun! I would go as far as saying that, some of the action in this film, was handled better than the first installment.Overall, I don't hate Age of Ultron, it's actually one of those films I don't mind revisiting, but because it doesn't age the best, with expositions here, there, and everywhere, I can't put Age of Ultron at the top of my MCU list."
" James Spader is menacing
",0.0,-0.92,2020-08-01 00:00:00,7,"SYNOPSIS:
While trying to protect the Earth from outside threats, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) creates ""Ultron"" (James Spader) as ultimate knowledge and a body of armor around the Earth. What Stark didn't know, was that he was creating something with the intentions of destroying everything.REVIEW:
This film might be the most underrated film in the entire MCU. By this, I don't mean people think it's the worst film, but they don't rate it as high as I believe it deserves. It's not a perfect film (Russian accents were... let's not talk about it), but it adds so much to the MCU story. It gives you a huge look into the importance of Hawkeye and shows the audience what's at stake for him versus everyone else. That he really is the only one with something to lose and he doesn't have a super power. Then you get even, mire conflict between Tony Stark and Steve Rodgers (Chris Evans) conveying how different theirs opinions are on the current (current as in the timeframe of the MCU at the time I'd release) ""world ending"" situation. Although the Russian Accents were... not spectacular, you get a dive into the origin of Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver and why they feel hatred towards Stark, however, not to the world as a whole. The pathos is easy to sympathize with.I'm so glad this was the conclusion to the Russian accent, I also wish they didn't expand on this weird love story between Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). I think the Russo's did pick up on the strange relationship there and decided to defuse it relatively quickly. I do understand why those two character would have an attraction, I mean Scarlett Johansson... but on a serious note they do have similar situations and so it makes sense, but there was never any real build up to it. I feel there wouldn't have been enough time to delve deep into that.Lastly, James Flippin' Spader is something else. His voice fits the character of Ultron so well. The inflections in his voice really bring a depth to the character. It gives you the feeling that this character is evil before they even do a terrible act. That's impressive. I do feel Ultron is a very underrated villain in the spectacle of MCU villains and should be treated with more respect.This is a film I always enjoy coming back to and I feel people should give more of a chance and see it for what it is. Even if you're not a fan of Hawkeye and his relevance to the Avengers... 7.7/10."

" A Decent Entry to the MCU
",0.0,0.6497,2020-07-20 00:00:00,6,"Age of Ultron is one of the lesser films in the MCU but still manages to be one of the more rewatchable in my opinion. With decent CGI and a great cast of characters, the film stays watchable. However the story of this film feels convoluted and very messy. The entire middle of this movie feels like a DCEU Movie, and I mean that in a bad way. Overall, Age of Ultron didn't live up to the hype and failed to be that great of a movie as well."
" A flawed plot, but still able to entertain...
",0.0,0.9125,2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,"The biggest problem with basing the plot of your movie around fighting an AI, is that a true AI is unbeatable... a true AI is capable of simultaneously controlling all robotic facilities on earth, at the same time, and endlessly creating a perfect army of their own flawless design... you simply can't beat an AI. And that's where the plot-holes start in this movie: Ultron doesn't act like a true AI. Ultron makes mistakes, and he is endlessly inefficient. A true AI can launch all nukes on earth in an instant and smash all satellites in orbit around the earth into each other, thus stopping all communication on earth, OR even better, he could reroute all satellites to ONLY relay his own communications. So like I said, you can't beat a true AI, because the human race and even the avengers, are powerless without technology and if that same technology/weapons is used against them in the form of robots/nukes then the human race stands no chance in defending itself.Anyway... the movie, apart from the plot-holes, is a pretty standard Marvel movie: Bad guys appear, the heroes fight said bad guys, and the movie ends. It's not as good as Deadpool or Thor Ragnarok, but it's still completely capable of providing 2hrs10mins of entertainment. 7/10."

After a solid phase two I initially felt it was solid but was disappointed mostly in the lackluster villain. That being said watching it all these years later it's quite thrilling. The characters are developed a bit more but not in the way you'd like them to be and the film does have some dragging sequences. That being said the new characters are fantastic Scarlet Witch played by Elizabeth Olsen is fierce and Quicksilver played by hottie Aaron Taylor Johnson is fun. The film is darker but the central group is as entertaining as ever. Sure there's a few blips along the way but it still stands as a fine piece of entertainment.Budget: $250m

It has everything you want in a superhero movie. I also really like Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver although they ended up wasting Quicksilver's character. I recommend Age of Ultron for any action movie fans!"
" The worst avengers movie but far from even a bad action film.
",-0.8074,0.9871,2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"Stark motivated by fear creates Ultron. The last living Hydra (until now) creates Wanda & Pietro using Loki's scepter. Nice follow up to previous storylines of solo filmsThe after party scene with Mjolnir is one of my favourites. This is the reason why I love MCU, the dialogues between the action sequence, character inactions, whips, callbacks. Watch NandovMovies video on this after party sequence.The twins are great, Wanda is flawed with bad past (even more now) and Pietro's dead in my opinion was worth it, at last someone died for real. In real life people die without notice, not all people have a chance to fullfil everything. Its was great for Wanda's motivation moving forward.
And Clint naming his son, Natalian Pietro Barton was nice. If you have seen Endgame, Clint's Son name is cursed.Captain America and Iron Man's fude continues, 'Everytime someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die'. The bitterness was better in Avengers 1 but still Avengers 2 has some great lines, 'A suit of armour everywhere' , 'We would lose -- Then we would do that together too' and seeing this lines pop up again in Endgame was fantastic.Thor has a side journey which I am not a fan, the slow discovery of infinity stones is great in the long run but it doesn't add anything to this movie in particular. Comparatively Wakanda's setup was better, as Ultron was also in the mix.Black Widow and Banner has romantic interaction which I liked at first but now it feels forced as they didn't continue with it.Ultron is just is another one of MCU's bad motivated villains, if they fleshed out the movitations more instead of weak subplots of Thor and Widow then it would have been better. James Spader voice is great, sometimes too comici. And sometimes thinking about how Ultron spends 5 minutes in the internet to decide to kill off humanity completely gets me cracking, it was good motivation but not fleshed out enough.Nick Fury adds more humor to the mix and Burton's family makes this movies more humanly relatable-- They are litteral Gods, and I have a bow & arrow.The ending is epic as a Avengers 3rd act should be, but Joss Wedons Avengers 1 was more well crafted. Hulkbuster Sequence was great sequence of entertainment. Movie could have much better, Loki was set up early, Thanos for 6 years but Ultron's set up & pay off was in the same film."

An action packed adrenaline ride all through. However this said the film lacked story. At first the film was taking over from the first avengers, the story was good. But somewhere into the film the story fell apart with too much happening and without the solid story line it felt weak, with no real connections at all there was just fighting and action all over. I thought from what little story this film had to offer it was a lot more comic based than the previous one. The main villain in this film felt like a weakly based character, he had little to do with the story and was probably a contributing factor into it's downfall.In conclusion I thought that the action, acting and effects are among the best, however the weak story left me with a far different feeling to the first. I thought although this film was great for a sequel it wasn't as good as the first. The film felt like it was meant to put a story across ready for the next film, which I hope will have a better story and live up to my expectations! However if for now you're looking for a great action film this is definitely a great one to watch, even though the story was weak and lacked that edge it is still a great film and hopefully will make an even better trilogy!"

That doesn't mean it's bad : on the contrary, it's an awesome movie and I always have a blast when watching it, but it doesn't have that special something that the others have.I love the additions Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, the Hawkeye storyline and the fact that this is probably the most character-driven Avengers movie, but at the same time, there are certain things that don't quite stick the landing for me. I feel like Vision's origin story is a little bit rushed, and for that reason I have never felt very attached to him in any of the following movies. Ultron is also a little weak in my opinion (I much preferred Loki in the original Avengers).Anyway, complaints aside, the action is fantastic, the stakes are high and Age of Ultron is another superb addition to Marvel's stacked library."

How exciting!For other Marvel works, a remarkable step forward is that on the basis of enough action drama, the usual heroism in the United States has become obscure, while team consciousness and humanitarianism have become supreme. (spoilers) the cloud rescue city is the pinnacle of the most wonderful part, and the little clues of the hero ""TASK"" are clear rather than fancy personal show.At the end of the film is a gathering of Marvel cosmic heroes: when the American captain says goodbye to Banner, Thor and Stark, standing at the new Avengers training base and shouting ""Avengers"" at Natasha, scarlet witches, war machines, falcons! I seem to have seen a new beginning in the Marvel universe.Some netizens on the rotten tomato website said the film lacked a humanistic core. I would like to say that first of all, this is a commercial work, second, it is science fiction, the important point is that its production is for Marvel fans, it is not an independent work, to shoot the human core, I am afraid to lose a lot of audience.I think the action of ""duplicate 2"" is very successful, without losing the science fiction component, not like the soft science fiction that the comment says."

All of this to create a well-constructed cinematography based on the great acting, special effects, direction and screenplay writing.
Different from the major of Marvel's movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron are constantly forcing the viewer to think about social/political questions centered on technology and union of people. This is a great advanced made by the production, because it compensates the all-action in the first Avengers and starts a new era for Marvel.
You will realize a lot of open spots on the plot, they are not screenplay's failure, they are proposital leaks to new advances in the Marvel's universe that will be resumed in posterior movies.
The only weak point on the work is the new hero. He is used as a key-point to the development and conclusion of the story, but he hasn't a great construction as character and break the rhythm of the plot, besides his adding to the reflections about society and humanity during the movie. Therefore, if he was substituted to explore more one of the heroes and the new piece of Marvel's universe, the movie will be 10/10."
" Solid but predictable
",0.0772,0.9992,2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"Joss Wheden returns to helm the second Avengers film within the cinematic universe. As I said in my review for The Avengers, you always know what you are going to get from Wheden and he very rarely fails to deliver. Once again as director (and writer), he delivers a top-notch action film with an ensemble cast of hero's and weaves everything together masterfully.Age of Ultron opens to the Avengers fighting off waves of Hydra forces on route to a secret research base (which we saw in The winter Soldier) and where the Maximoff twins are located. This is also (as we know from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) where Hydra have been keeping Loki's sceptre and using it to conduct experiments on volunteers in order to try and replicate the abilities that the Inhumans possess to further goal for world domination and to finish the Avengers.Strucker, one of the new heads of Hydra wishes to use the twins abilities to defend the facility but others are not so sure they are ready. Once inside Stark gets to downloading information from Hydra's computer systems but Wanda (well played from Olsen) manages to warp his mind (in a first proper glimpse into her powers) which gives him visions of the Avengers all dead in a pile on a futuristic battlefield. With Strucker and the twins escaping the Avengers return with the sceptre for further anylysis before Thor finds a safe haven for the weapon.We then discover that Stark is planning on building a shield around the Earth (Ultron) and after studying the sceptre with Banner (an excellent Ruffalo again) believes the power of the crystal within the sceptre can be harnassed and starts to try to integrate Jarvis with it in order to create the ultimate protection system for the planet. Unfortunately for Stark (and everyone else) this leads to a rather unexpected result.This unexpected result forms the basis for the film which could quite easily have been split into two films if they decided to go down that route and follow the comic stroyline more closely. As it is we only really get a glimpse of what went on there and instead Ultron feels rather largely wasted. They could have done so much more with the character then ultimately just end up having him as the token bad guy within a standard films run-time. Regardless, he is well done and Spader must be credited with bringing him to life and giving him some degree of personality.To the rest of the film, I guess we should start with the maximoff twins. We finally get our real first look at Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) and what unique powers they have along with a little more back story for them both. Unfortunately what isn't clear is exactly how and where they came from. This is due to immeasurable red tape regarding licensing and Fox having the right for the X-Men (for anyone who does not know the real back-story then the internet is your friend). There are numerous hints and clues dropped though that their powers did not come from the sceptre and experiments alone and they they may in fact have been dormant within them.Hopefully we now have the possibility (now Disney have aquired Fox and got the x-men franchise back) that Marvel can blend the two back-stories together and we will get some their father within the MCU (as well as others) so one can only hope there. I'm certain Kevin Feige can do it better than Fox could have ever dreamed of. Regardless, Elizibeth Olsen (thankfully the decent normal, non crazy sister) is excellent in the role and I also think has the looks to pull off the characters birth heritage. A lot was made of not casting an Eastern European for the role and I feel Marvel got this just right with Olsen as she is an excellent choice to play Wanda.As for action scenes, we're talking Whedon's Avengers, so epic destruction on a truly epic scale wherever they go is the order of the day. The special effects at the beginning looked a little off but from then on they are excellent. Ending action/fight scene is truly stunning and far better than in the first Avengers film. ILM did a fantastic job here as they usually do when given a big budget and everything (barring the start as said) looks like it should be there and not digitally thrown in. Top marks indeed to all involved in that side of the production.Direction is also excellent (as one would expect from Whedon) and the script also on point and very well written. This one doesn't contain quite the amount of himour and one-liners as seen in previous films, but hat there is, is very well written and acted and spoken by the cast. The Captain's hero speech is excellent and has lots of feels and Clint's to Wanda is also very well done. And the whole scene with Stan Lee's obligatory cameo has to be his best yet and is a absolute delight. We also get some lovely moments between The Hulk and Black Widow as we get to see more of their developing relationship.For the rest of the cast, everyone is excellent once again. It's great to finally see Paul Bettany (Jarvis) rather than just hear him and we again get small cameo's from Samuel Jackson as Fury, Mackie as Falcon, Smulder as Maria Hill along with a minor appearance from Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter. Don Cheadle represies his character as Rhodes with War Machine though he doesn't have a great deal of screen time this time around but it does keep a nice continuation of characters that keep appearing.We also get to learn and see a lot more regarding Clint Barton's character and that whole segment adds a nice feel to a movie that at the time needs to just reflect. We also get some more insight into Natasha's background also to show us how she became the person she is. And last but not least (in a film that tends to throw a litte of everything at you) we get to learn and see some more infinity stone goodness along with a little more Josh Brolin for good measure to lead us into future events. An all round excellent film that just falls short in my opinion of the first Avengers movie but that is head and shoulders above the rest of the Marvel offerings. As they say, everything is better with friends.The Sage's Rating: 8/10"

" The weakest avengers movie, but still good
",0.4019,-0.2907,2020-04-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie is a bit hard to remember what even happened. A lot of it is quite forgettable. They story doesn't really get advanced at all for any of the characters apart from a general distrust for Tony Stark and the birth of Vision. Ultron was average. Just another bad guy who was always going to lose, no one really cares. This was just another chance for the Avengers crew to get together and film some 360 degree fight scene. You always knew that no one significant was going to get hurt. Iron man was always going to get hurt beyond belief and have all the gunshots come his way. But Captain America and Black Widow can go bullet free. The Avengers movies are always a chance to show the weakest links which are blatantly Hawk Eye and Black Widow. Both can be left out and it wouldn't make much difference to the overall fight. But the others really contribute to the overall strength of the Avengers.This movie is still a good watch, but definitely the weakest out of the four Avengers movies."
" Scarlet Witch is my wifey
",-0.3612,0.8731,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"They do need to figure out how to settle on a genre with these movies, because I'm not sure what they were going for. At times it felt like I was watching a cartoon, and other times a sci-fi movie. I will say that James Spader's performance as Ultron was chilling. I got chills down my spine every time he spoke. The advantage of Disney owning Marvel is they can have villians sing otherwise happy Disney songs and ruin people's childhoods by making them creepy. Now, concerning the characters of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. (Scarlet Witch is my MCU crush!) Neither of their actor(esses) sounds genuinely Russian, and at times you can tell the accent is fake, because half the sentence will be in an American accent and the other half a ""Russian"" accent. I did enjoy the witty banter between all the members of the Avengers, and surprisingly, even Ultron had some witty dialogue. He is probably the best villain in any of the MCU films. Now, one more thing. I didn't put the ""One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits"" meme like I usually do, because there's only one scene after the first 2 minutes of credits, but nothing at the end, so don't wait for the very end of the credits.

" Whedon inserts new elements presented in the most recent films of the characters, and expanding the story to a more global level
",0.0,0.9991,2020-03-02 00:00:00,8,"It is no secret that the challenge is enormous. In addition to maintaining the great quality of the films of this second phase of Marvel, Joss Whedon tries to overcome himself here, since the first Avengers is practically a unanimity between critics and the public. And he manages to reach a similar level, delivering yet another spectacular film in every way, inserting new elements presented in the most recent films of the characters, and expanding the story to a more global level. Whedon, who once again does not have to tell origin stories, let alone find a good reason to reunite all the heroes again, is free to go straight to the point, going straight to the plot.Trying to protect the planet from threats like those seen in the first The Avengers, Tony Stark seeks to build an artificial intelligence system that would take care of world peace. The project ends up going wrong and generates the birth of Ultron (voice of James Spader). Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) will have to come together again save the day.Whedon already begins the film with a spectacular action scene, where the skills of several heroes are shown during the invasion of one of the bases of H.I.D.R.A, where they recover the Scepter of Loki, an inexhaustible source of energy and psychic control. In parallel, seeking to keep the local population safe, drones commanded by Jarvis (at the behest of Stark) try to reduce collateral damage, but they are not welcomed in these eastern European lands. Tony's project has already started, creating an immediate cohesion with Extremis technology, which we saw in Iron Man 3, right after they recovered the artifact that gives Tony Stark the possibility to advance in the project he developed with Dr. Bruce Banner. In Stark's conception, it would be the end of the group, while they would be replaced by a ""bigger shield"", an omniscient protection that they themselves could not overcome, something very similar to what we saw in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Once an arms manufacturer, Iron Man continues to be forced to face the result of his past actions. Becoming a superhero was part of the process of dealing with that awareness. Now, becoming a global defender is an even more powerful opportunity in that sense.As in the first Avengers, the meeting of the heroes is cohesive and well balanced. There is no central character taking on a more important posture, not even Captain America who is the leader of the group in the comics and also in the films. As a matter of fact, characters who did not have such a large participation in the last film, have the chance to participate more effectively in the plot as a whole. It is like that with the Black Widow and the Hulk, who end up building an important sexual tension between them, putting on the agenda the possibility of a possible relationship, showing two traumatized and fragile people who hope to live a normal life together, away from the Avengers and of everything that implies this coexistence. The similarities between both characters already existed, but the script highlights and seeks them. Another highlight is Gavião Arqueiro, a happy and married man with two children and one more on the way. This relationship between Gavião and his wife, the fact that they live in isolation and his relationship with his family is explored. In fact, this isolated and calm place is where heroes try to recover from nightmares that torment them from that point on.New characters were also introduced efficiently. James Spader is the android Ultron. He, who acted in person and later was replaced by computer graphics of motion capture, is undoubtedly the great success. The actor, basically with his voice, lends a threatening, cold and even ironic tone to the villain, who dictates that to solve a problem you must eliminate its source: the Avengers and humanity. Its triumphal entry seems to have been taken directly from a horror film. We don't have a simple homicidal machine in it, but something completely human, which makes it even more terrifying.Speaking of motion capture, there is no way to mention the participation of Andy Serkis (the Gollum of ""The Lord of the Rings"", the Caesar of ""The Planet of the Apes"", the King Kong of the Peter Jackson remake) in the skin of the dealer of arms Ulysses Klaue in a cameo. He is responsible for removing the vibranium metal from the African nation of Wakanda and selling it on the black market. It's the same alloy that makes up Captain America's shield, it's the material that Ultron needs to build his indestructible body.We also have the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson), known in the comics as Mercury and Scarlet Witch. Since Marvel / Disney does not own the rights to the mutant word, owned by FOX in theaters, it was up to Joss Whedon to reinvent the origin of the characters. In the film, the brothers are the result of experiments conducted by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), a scientist at HYDRA, a Nazi organization that extended its tentacles within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. - as shown last year in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Pietro has super speed as a characteristic and participates well in some good action scenes. But it is Wanda who gains more prominence and importance due to his powers of manipulating reality - and perception. In comics, she combines her changing power to alter reality with witchcraft, a mixture that, in the cinema, could be confused. Joss Whedon simplifies the equation, giving him telekinesis combined with the power to invade minds, unlocking unconscious fears from his ""victims"".One of the new heroes to be worked on is Vision (also Paul Bettany). A perfect adaptation of the character on the pages, the creature appears simplifying all its concepts from the comic books, but at the same time keeping them intact. The android Visão, created by the film's own villain to harbor his conscience, but which ends up ""rescued"" by the heroes, becoming his ally. Vision is, in fact, a ""symptom"", an artificial person with his own thoughts. Interestingly, Vision and the Scarlet Witch formed, in the comics, one of Marvel's most unlikely couples. It is not impossible to imagine that the novel is also mirrored in cinema.The film has a darker, darker tone, but it has a balance that doesn't let it get too serious at any time. Like any Marvel movie, the movie is full of jokes, mostly good ones. At no point does the film stop amusing itself in the midst of action that does not disappoint once again. As already shown before, we have important ethical discussions between Captain America and Iron Man. Steve Rogers is the perfect opposite to the idea, which flirts with totalitarianism, of a corporate peacekeeping force, acting on foreign soil, of Iron Man. This discussion could have been further explored and debated in the script, generating consequences for the Age of Ultron, not just a prelude to the coming Civil War.One of the differences from the previous film that brought together the heroes is the relationship between the characters. There are many more scenes of interaction between everyone, however the number and scale of the action scenes is even greater, which was a little exaggerated in certain sequences, which seem to come directly from the comic book pages to the big screen. Despite this, they are visually creative, beautiful and imposing scenes. Among the main action scenes, we can highlight the invasion of the H.I.D.R.A hideout, the scene of the appearance of Ultron in the middle of the party where the Avengers are gathered; the scenes on the African Coast; the fight between Hulk and Hulkbuster (with Tony Stark in special armor); the fight and chase involving the Black Widow, the Captain and Ultron in public transport through the streets of Seoul, in addition to the great final battle in Sokovia. The scenarios of the confrontations are completely different from those of The Avengers, leaving luxurious New York for marginal environments, much more impoverished, but also much more human. In the plot, the evil presence also denotes more impact, gravity in the situation, as, given the much larger number of characters, it becomes uncertain who will survive and who will die.Avengers: Age of Ultron is yet another hit by Marvel, creating a unique and exciting experience for the general public. Joss Whedon knows how few combine action, drama, science fiction and humor in one film to amuse everyone. There was no shortage of destroyed cities, shattered robots and spectacular scenes, whether in the air or on land. With the terrain prepared, it remains to await The Civil War, which will show the split between heroes."
" Mixed sequel

Whedon had an idea of what he wanted to include, but it sounds like he struggled to create the film he wanted with execs. This wasn't a straight forward sequel and when you consider phase 2 overall, this doesn't deliver. I enjoyed the film, but it's bloated and Ultron doesn't have a real impact. Whedon was maybe ambitious with the film, and this resulted in him leaving the series. There's some interesting idea's here, but it feels like a step to the next Avengers film, much like Iron Man 2 was to the first Avengers."

The comedy was pretty good, except for a certain something they did with the comedy in this film. The action in this movie was very good, I had a really fun time with it.Now the cons, I wanted ultron to be good, since the trailers showed us that he could be one of the best villains in film in history, well in my words, however I was wrong, what they did with Ultron is insulting to the character and its fans, Ultron was used as comedic relief, it didn't even look like they even tried to make him an actual villain, he was not menacing, he had no motivation, he was just really a bland and flat out boring character. Personally I am not a fan of the story, to me the story is just forgettable. There were times in this movie where certain parts were just thrown in there.Conclusion: Age of Ultron is an entertaining movie, but it falls a part when it comes to Ultron, choices in the movie, and the story. As an action or Sci Fi movie, it's good. But as a marvel movie, it barely succeeds."

" They made some characters stupid so that they could argue.
",-0.7003,-0.9542,2019-12-19 00:00:00,6,"I have loved almost every MCU movie. Civil War and Age of Ultron are two blemishes on the stretch of great movies for me though. I liked all three Thors, all of Cap's, both of GOTG, both Ant-mans, all of the Spider-mans including Far From Home, and I even enjoyed all of the Iron Mans. I know lots of people disliked Iron Man two and three, a lot disliked Thor Dark World, and a lot disliked GOTG 2. I liked them all myself. However the bickering and blame game drama of Civil War and Ultron just contaminated those two movies for me a bit too much.I saw this way back in 2015. I remember how I was just annoyed how they dumbed down the characters just to make them argue. It just infuriated me that they were all just bickering with each other and being idiots. Not the heroes I wanted to see. A bunch of blame game out-of-character nonsense. What is worse is that the arguments weren't even rational. It is like they just needed to create some fake drama filler as if this were a stupid reality tv show.I also recall feeling that they didn't completely make the villain make sense. His intent for the reason said was just illogical. That angered me as well.There WERE lots of GOOD things in this movie, but I'm keeping it at just six out of ten because these negatives really weighed on my mind throughout the movie. For the plot itself to be compromised...dang it really bummed me out. I do advise watching it if you are going to watch Infinity War or Endgame. There are some good things in these Ultron and Civil War that I am glad I didn't miss out on."

" Ensemble pieces are hard.
",-0.1027,0.9984,2019-11-25 00:00:00,6,"You have several main characters revolving around one goal, but all of these characters should be unique and driven by their own wants and needs, but all of those wants and needs need to be connected to the core of the story. When you take half a dozen heroes who are (largely) off on their own adventures most of the time, it can take some doing, and I don't think that doing was done quite well enough here.The Avengers have been wiping out Hydra one base at a time for some months and have come across the final large stronghold. They quip their way to victory, discovering Loki's spear from the first Avengers as well as two ""enhanced"" individuals (one who's fast and the other that's weird). With the spear, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner begin to analyze it in order to figure out how to take advantage of it. What they end up doing is creating Ultron, an advanced AI that takes a cryptic mission from Tony (""peace in our time"") and twists it in a very Asimov sort of way to mean all of human life must end because there will be no peace with people. He overcomes Tony's personal digital assistant (Jarvis), inhabits a robotic body and uploads himself to the Internet so he can escape into anything he wishes.There's a fight, Ultron escapes, he finds some vibranium (helpfully expanding the MCU slightly in the process with references to Wakanda), and escapes again, this time with the help of the two enhanced. He escapes to South Korea where he uses a scientist to create a ""real"" body for him (how this is appreciably better than his upgraded body he gets later isn't really explained). Through another action sequence, the Avengers steal this body and then bring it to life so that it becomes Vision. Everything converges in the invented Central European country Sokovia (where the movie opened) where Ultron, who's been talking positively of the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs throughout the movie, has creating a system that will life the capitol city up in the air before dropping it to the ground with enough force to cause a global extinction event, which the Avengers avert. Because of course.So, there's the plot. A lot is going on. I think the stuff around the creation of the body that becomes Vision is really just there so we can get Vision. As part of Ultron's plan, it feels extraneous at best. His end goal is human extinction. Having some sort of humanish metal body feels just extra. But around this large, somewhat unfocused, plot we have our heroes, and as I implied earlier, not a lot of them seem to be there for any other reason than they are Avengers.First, let's talk about what this movie is supposed to be about. The first Avengers was really an excuse to get superheroes together to fight a heavy. The underlying idea was about team building. It was facile, but it worked and every character was functioning towards that goal. In this, the goal seems to be centered around Tony Stark's desire to create a replacement for the Avengers in the form of a highly intelligent AI that will protect Earth from threats originating from off world. It's an extension of where Tony was left at the end of Iron Man 3. He wants Iron Man to be unnecessary. The creation he ends up with fights back (using ""I've got no strings"" from Pinocchio quite effectively in a creepy sort of way), and Captain America's assertion that humans should always be part of the decision making process ends up correct. In terms of characters who seem involved in this thematic idea you have Tony, Bruce Banner, Captain America, and Hawkeye. The rest feel extra, taking the movie in different directions.Thor is the one who seems the most out of place. He's there for a literal reason (Loki's scepter is supposed to go back to Asgard with him), but outside of that he doesn't really contribute to any of the movie's core idea. In fact, he famously goes off in the middle of the movie to help inform the audience about Infinity Stones. They sacrificed cohesion of the film itself in order to help sell later installments of the franchise, and the movie suffers for it. Black Widow also feels like she's in another movie. The exploration of her past is interesting, but I don't see how it feeds into the ideas at the movie's core. What this does overall is create a disjointed experience that keeps the movie from coming together as a single work.There's quite a few individual pieces of the film that I like quite a bit. The action scenes are fun (though, we get another big CGI army). I really like Ultron himself. He's not just a quippy form of Loki. He's driven by an ideology and a set of beliefs all while talking in a way that betrays the malfunction at his core. The relationship that begins to blossom between Natasha and Bruce is both sweet and tied to some interesting unique parts of their characters (Natasha's insistence that she's a monster and her ability to draw Bruce out of the Hulk). And I really like the central idea and how that manifests in Ultron. I just wish the movie came together a bit better."

The film isn't as dark as the trailers made it look which was disappointing. And at times the film got a little unfocused when it had to set up other films. Once again the cast is great and the are some great action scenes. The new characters are good and the villain was good but I wished he was darker and less goofy. Still there is a lot to enjoy in the movie.8.0/10

I really liked the personality of Ultron. He's funny, intelligent, deadly and crazy. Very different from the usual emotionless evil robot. I didn't like the idea of the Romanov/Banner romance, but the actors actually pulled it off pretty well. Loved the Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver, and I was thrilled to see Vision on the big screen. I never thought THAT would happen. Paul Bettany was perfect in that part. The only thing I didn't like was the death of a particular character that has been one of my favorites in the comics. I really hope they pull an ""only MOSTLY dead"" deal, and bring him back. Anyway, I loved this film! Keep 'em coming Marvel! (and DC!)"

" Frankenstein's Avengers
",0.0,-0.9915,2019-09-29 00:00:00,6,"This sequel, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" is surely flawed, but it's an interesting mixture of two popular movie genres: the relatively new comic-book superhero one, which has only recently emerged to dominate the box office in this age of Hollywood franchises, and the older genre of the horror film. Both may've been originally (or still) sneered at by many--perhaps, even for good reason, including repetitious and superficial fan servicing--but they've been extraordinarily popular. Last year, during the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley's novel ""Frankenstein,"" I reviewed a bunch of related films in relation to that book, as well as seeing how such shockers became a Hollywood staple. For some reason, I neglected two superhero pictures that are partly based on ""Frankenstein."" Both are in part made by Joss Whedon, who had already mixed pulpy vampirism with teen drama for TV with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" and he was behind the meta-horror of ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012). So why not rework Shelley's creation for comic-book characters, which he's done here and did again, later, with ""Justice League"" (2017).The Marvel Cinematic Universe has unleashed a whole new monster of franchise building; one need not look far for its imitators to see that it's become the envy of the motion-picture world, but even if one traces the superhero franchise back to the Christopher Reeve Superman films and the Tim Burton Batmans, this genre is relatively young. Going any further back, comic-book film adaptations become the pure kiddie stuff of cartoons and serials. The Hollywood horror film, on the other hand, dates back to 1931 when Universal released ""Dracula"" and, soon thereafter, ""Frankenstein."" Both based on 19th-century Gothic horror novels, although more so their theatrical iterations over the years. Both were box-office successes, too, but they also received harsher criticism than any recent superhero movie has; they were censored, and the genre was de-facto banned for a few years. Later, these monsters launched the first shared cinematic universe beginning with ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1943). Now, they're considered classics, and although ""Age of Ultron"" may never be considered that, ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), say, or ""Logan"" (2017) already are. All of which is to say that these two types of cinemas seem a natural fit. Moreover, Gothic horror such as ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" in particular, are about science and modernity, alter egos and supernatural abilities.""Age of Ultron"" hints at its scary-movie roots from the start with the Avengers attacking what is essentially a haunted house on a hill. Just look at the way Scarlet Witch (apt name there, too) floats backwards through a door that seemingly closes on its own, as though she were Dracula. Heck, she even has mesmerizing powers to read others' minds and trick them into dreams. The faux Eastern European accent only completes the Bela Lugosi imitation--you know, except she blasts red magic energy from her hands and body. The haunted house also features a mad doctor's dream laboratory where artificial intelligence was being mined from one of those supernatural infinity stones. The two mad doctors of the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man and Bruce Banner/Hulk (the latter of whom has always essentially been a derivative of Jekyll/Hyde, except with smashing replacing Robert Louis Stevenson's original drug abuse and sexual promiscuity), then, take this magical tech back to their lair's lab to, basically, inadvertently unleash a Frankenstein monster, Ultron. This robot creature even stumbles into the Avengers party like he were Boris Karloff freshly reanimated and just learning how to walk and what to think. The Avengers will teach him that ""fire bad""--or at least that laser things shot out of superheroes bad for robots--soon enough, too.Furthermore, Captain America reminds us that he was the experiment of a German scientist and was reanimated from a frozen state. Likewise, Black Widow's flashback dream includes remembering that her body was altered, too, to create the weapon that she is today (for feminist critics of this storyline, this is why it exists). The reason Hawkeye is the ""heart"" or ""soul"" of the team this episode is probably because he's the only one who doesn't think of himself as something of an engineered or otherwise supernatural monster. Iron Man has an electrical plant for a heart and is a man dressing as a robot. Hulk is inching closer to Mr. Hyde entirely out of the control of Dr. Jekyll. The Witch and her speedy brother were also made in a lab. Even Fury is missing an eye. And Thor is an alien god running around with a magic hammer on Earth, for crying out loud.Thus, we have a cast of characters who are something of Frankensteins themselves, who then go on to more blatantly reference the 1931 ""Frankenstein"" film is giving life to another AI robot (whether with synthetic skin or vibranium what have you or not), Vision. The god of thunder even comes back from his vision quest in a magical pool to provide the lightning bolt of a spark of life to the creature. Indeed, the Vision body was originally planned as the creation of Ultron, who brain washed his own mad scientist for the purpose. So, there is quite a bit of Frankenstein creating going on here. As Tony tells Bruce, ""We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You've got to own it.""I enjoy this stitched-together from various genre and technical body parts aspect even if does lead to an imbalance of dark lighting and production design for talking scenes out of a horror movie conflicting with action sequences shot in daylight complete with interruptions of slow-motion superhero poses and bad one-line jokes. (Cap's aversion to cursing especially pisses me off. He was reanimated from fighting super-Nazis, not from ""Leave It to Beaver;"" he should act like it, dammit.) Plus, there's the usual modern-movie dichotomy of live action mixed with CGI animation, which continues to improve. Some of the picture is blandly unimaginative, though. There's too much set-up for future franchise installments. A fight sequence on a runaway train seems particularly to be a rip-off of the better scene from ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004). Although James Spader provides an amusingly chatty voice for a robot, the character is very reminiscent of ""The Terminator"" franchise; AI awakes, gets into the interweb, manufactures an army of mechanical clones, seeks to destroy mankind--we've seen it before. And the Quicksilver character pales in comparison to the version from the prior ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014).The apology theme for the Avengers' military adventurism is lackluster, as well. It worked better in ""Iron Man"" (2008) as a reflection of the War on Terror. And, really, do they have to make up places--""Sokovia?"" I'll accept ""Wakanda,"" but what precisely is the political point they're dancing around to try not to offend anyone with this vaguely Eastern European country? I sense this militarism of the Avengers, read (Captain) America, should be another Frankenstein monster here, but it's too muddled. Much of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is alive, but some of the body is dead parts."

" A FANTASTIC FILM, SEQUEL & MY FAVOURITE AVENGERS FILM
",0.5574,0.999,2019-08-19 00:00:00,9,"Age of ultron actually beats the brilliant first film, i absolutely LOVED Avengers Assemble & Age of ultron is an even better film than that!!!The opening scene is action packed excitement, the Avengers are on a mission & are battling Hydra soldiers through a snowy forest & it's a breathtakingly beautiful sequence!!!
Captain America is still my favourite Avenger, he's the lost relic from another time & he remains loyal & is the heart of the Avengers.
This superb sequel really grabbed me & pulled me into this fantasy world with this amazing team of crime fighters, you really care for these characters & that's how well written they are & the world they exist in!!!The chemistry between the Avengers team is great, playful & fun but full of heart, the team bounce off of each other, they became great friends & are a joy to watch together.I found this fantastic sequel to be more grittier, Darker in tone & atmosphere & more heartfelt, there's a great depth to this story & it's characters, the script is superb it's fantastic writing.
Each Avenger is given plenty of room to shine & really grow as a character especially Natasha (Black Widow) She is excellent & really shines as one of the greatest & bravest of the team!!! A fantastic performance from Scarlett Johansson, also Hawkeye is given alot more depth to his own story, we find out he has a pregnant wife & two kids, there's a warm touching scene where the Avengers hide out at his big country house & meet his family.
There's so many great character moments & stunning action scenes.
The great Jeremy Renner steals the show as Hawkeye for me, a great character that gets more screen time in this sequel.
The Nightmare scenes that each Avenger suffers after the witch plays with their minds is so well done it plays out like a Horror movie, very creepy & dark scenes.
Ultron is a Terrifying villain, an Artificial intelligence nightmare robot who creates an army of deadly robots to destroy earth, he's genuinely creepy & very menacing, a much better villain than Loki in my opinion.The directing, the music, the acting, the action & the characters are all done perfectly.
Probably the best Avengers film in my opinion & one of the greatest comic book films ever MADE!!!"

The storyline was coherent and made sense, the villain was mediocre but way better than Thanos, and at least Marvel was trying at this point.Having recently seen both endgame and Spider-Man far from home I no longer have hope that Marvel can pull through and be that company that created such great movies like Iron Man, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and even the original Thor. All of those movies were amazing, they were well written they were exciting and brought a sense of magic that is completely devoid and gone from these new movies. They may as well be made for TV movies, it's like Marvel has devolved back to the Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk TV series, which honestly and episode of that is better than Spider-Man far from home. Marvel has just become this pathetic, PC company that no longer cares about quality over quantity."

Quciksilver and Wanda are whatever in this movie but I love Hawkeye in this movie. The tension between Cap and iron man starts to be built for Civil War. The battle of Sokovia is good and sets and molds the future of the Mcu.

Nothing big happened in the first 2 i feel like, no major deaths of things that will impact the avengers harshly. I feel like the next two are the main movies so maybe they will be better and more exiting. My parents were sleeping the whole time so its good that nothing important happened. Same story like the first, the second most expensive movie ever made, i mean the cgi in some scenes are terrible but im kinda used to because its an MCU film.

And the whole Black widow and hulk romance didn't make sense since in the first Avengers film, she was terrified of hulk. It would've made more sense if there was a Black widow and Hawkeye romance but then came the twist where it turns out that Hawkeye has a secret family. And not to mention why did they kill off Quicksilver after one movie? It would've made more sense if they saved his death for civil war and gave him some more character development but they just killed him after one movie. But I love the action scenes and the humor is funny. The dialogue is also on point. I love the final battle as well.

It's a not quite darker entry. But more of a grey entry. It's a little bleek. And very grey. The main plot is Tony Stark messes up and 2 hours of them trying to fix it.

I'm glad I did.I must be honest, after the opening - which made the film look more like a video game than a live action movie - I had little hope of enjoying it. Thankfully the film vastly improved after the opening scene. Some of the visuals were overdone, but for most part the visuals were spectacular. The slow motion photography with stuff happening all over the screen was incredible. Hollywood's inclination to destroy as much as possible in these movies never cease, do they, but I admit it really was actually fun in this movie.This was the most I've enjoyed the Tony Stark character since 2008's 'Iron Man'. In fact, I enjoyed ALL the characters so much more than in 'The Avengers'. They had more flesh to them (uhm, figuratively speaking, off course). The plot and characters had more depth, and I enjoyed the chemistry between Black Widow and Hulk. It was subtle and sincere.'Age of Ultron' was wonderful entertainment from beginning to end. The attack on the city during the finale was sensational!! This honestly was a lot of fun!"

",0.6588,0.9828,2019-05-26 00:00:00,10,"What makes this movie interesting is the main villain. Ultron(James Spader) is a fanatic created by Stark in an attempt to be a peace keeper. Unfortunately Ultron sees eradication of the human race as the only way to achieve peace and recruits 2 mutants to help him. They're the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. It's up to the Avengers to clean up Stark's mess.There's not much else to say other than the action, acting, effects and dialogue are awesome. When you see Ultron you really feel that he's there. The fight scene with him and Captain America is pretty cool and there're scenes like that. The villian's I interesting in that he thinks his cause is for the good of humanity when it's quite the opposite.I can't describe enough how awesome this movie is.

" A Major Disappointment
",-0.5106,0.9963,2019-05-08 00:00:00,3,"I'd like to preface this review by saying I am a really big Marvel fan. I have been for a long time, ever since the first Avengers movie came out. So when I say that this movie was a real disappointment, I'm saying that as a fan, not a movie critic.The concept of this movie is a good one. Tony Stark tries to create an AI to protect the world from alien threats, but the AI goes rogue and tries to destroy humanity. But that's really all I can say is good about this movie. The concepts. The concept for Ultron is a good one. The concept for the Vision is a good one. The concept for the Battle of Sokovia is a good one. But this movie is more than a concept. And I have to judge it that way.The execution of these concepts is incredibly poor. What are written as serious issues are played off as jokes and gags. The big problem with this movie is that they don't take themselves seriously, yet still expect us to care. Ultron's plan is to destroy all of humanity and create a better world inhabited only by machines. They build him up as this intimidating character that should be feared. His first appearance is actually one of the best scenes in the whole movie. It's intimidating, eerie, and leaves you uncertain on what the Avengers are going to do to stop him. However, all his other appearances are played off for laughs. Ultron acts more like a human than a heartless machine. Bad puns and unfunny one-liners completely undo what they built up this character to be, and as a result he is no longer interesting.Now I'll admit that I'm not a comic book fan. The only things I know about these characters come from the movies they've appeared in. I don't know if Ultron is the same way in the comics as he is in this movie. Nor do I care. I don't care if he's like this in the comics because this movie isn't a comic. It's a movie. If this movie doesn't give me good reasons to care about this character, then I'm not gonna care what he's like in the comics.Another thing that this movie does not execute well is the action. Like I said before, I really like the concept for the Battle of Sokovia. I really like Ultron's plan on paper. Unfortunately, it's a mess on the big screen. The special effects and choreography are fine, but the enemies they're fighting mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. As a result the action seems anticlimactic and futile. You don't care about what they're fighting because not only are they all the same, but they're nothing but machines. Pawns. Cannon fodder for the Avengers to beat up, blow up, shoot at, and utterly destroy without any moral consequences. I'm not saying you should be emotionally attached to every goon in these sorts of action movies, but the problem with making them machines is that they don't have souls. When a character kills a living enemy, whether human, alien, or even animal, it has weight because, like us, it was a living creature. They may have had lives, families, futures, you name it. No matter who they are, whether common thieves or terrorists, they are still human, and killing a living thing will always carry more weight than killing waves upon waves of robots. It's just not the same.On top of that, there are SO MANY OF THEM. They kill one and it gets instantly replaced, and as a result it not only seems never ending, but after a while it gets stale and boring. That's the best way I can describe the action in this move: boring. I don't care about Ultron, I don't care about his robot goons, and I don't care about his plan. I wanted to, but these things are so poorly executed that I can't. I care about these characters, but I don't feel any tension because I know that they're not gonna die in this movie. Yes, I know Quicksilver dies. But not only do I know nothing about him other than he runs fast and has a tragic backstory, but the acting is so bland that I can't even pretend to care about him. When I think of this character I can't help but think of the Quicksilver I know from the X-Men movies and how much more interesting he is. His action scenes are entertaining, especially in Days of Future Past. I care about that character. But this Quicksilver gives me absolutely no reason to care about him. And so I don't.Avengers: Age of Ultron is one disappointment after the other. Everything about this movie had potential. The story, the characters, everything. It all looked good on paper. But what we were given was a poorly executed, poorly acted, poorly planned movie that didn't know where to go with any of those ideas. I'm not gonna stop you from watching or even enjoying this movie. If you get enjoyment out of it then I'm happy for you. You got what you wanted out of it and I didn't. And that's fine. Maybe it just wasn't for me. But this is my opinion. This is why I didn't like this movie. I wrote this review because I want Marvel to do better. And since this movie came out they have done better. MUCH better. I want them to succeed. Because, as I said, I am a big Marvel fan. And all I want is for Marvel to do these characters and these stories justice.Thank you for reading."
" The age of size of a match: short but bright
",0.5927,0.9841,2019-05-07 00:00:00,7,"Once you start doing something it's hard to stop. That's the case with the Avengers: even without the imminent and devastating danger they keep working together even on issue of local scale, which gives us the opportunity to see the pompous show-off and some cool teamwork. However, when it comes to such a grand title we expect something massive to happen. What can possibly be bigger that the attack from outer space?Apparently, there are many ways to endanger the peace on the planet, and, as it mostly happens, the reason is a human mistake. The artificial intelligence always has scared people and the idea of it getting evil has troubled the minds of many geniuses over times. The most prominent example is the Terminator. So here comes the Marvel interpretation of the AI problem with a savior-turned-villain creation of Tony Stark that grew its twisted conscience and decided to make the world better.The creators have an enormous collection of good and bad characters; I really appreciate the effort of introducing us to more and more unique figures of the universe, which makes every movie a surprise for every fan. The stand-off between the two opposing sides kicks off several times and, frankly, every encounter gets better and better.The dark cloud that shades the sun here is the talks. The long, boring and repeating speeches explaining the reasoning. Sure, they make the bad guy look worse and the armor on our knights shine better, however, the preciseness is a key to success.On the side of the action one can say that the sequel has kept the pace and even tried to outperform the predecessor. From a nice team fight to a duel of a year that was on everyone's mind to even bigger final clash. The hallmark of a franchise is a slow-motion group interlude, which looks cool but only there to stress the fact that it's not a solo movie feels overused but what won't you do to please the fans.I am going to go ahead and say that the idea is not new but still interesting and with a few novel tricks up the creators' sleeves, however, the outcome of a story is a little bit disappointing. Some might say that it wrapped up too easily and I will totally agree, Ultron with all its computational power turned to be just an improved version of my pocket calculator - I hoped for more.Dipping the feather into the ink I will end up this history chapter by saying that the 'age' is a too big word, because the length of this ""reign"" was hysterically short although it for sure was impressive. The second part did a solid job but it didn't jump as high as the pioneer of the franchise, all my hopes are that we will get some more stories that next generations will wish they could have watched on the time of the premiere."

Action scenes are awesome and jokes are funny! Also Hawkeye stole the show!The Bad: Some bad CGI here and there, and Tony Stark got aggravating in this one.Overall, Age of Ultron was an awesome entry in the MCU (the best since the first Captain America) A must see!"

I was hoping to see the villain, Ultron, to actually bring down the Avengers like in the comics or actually see some characters die in the movie (well one), but we didn't get those which makes the trailer , to me, feel misleading.But me feeling underwhelming cause I didn't get what I was expecting, this was a kiss-ass movie.

They should stand for that old cliche - truth, justice, and the.... well that covers it well enough.We are already beginning to see the moral ambiguity of Captain America: Civil War. Stark is not a good person. The end justifies the means for him and. I question if there is any line he wouldn't cross. Most of the other Avengers are not quite as ambiguous, but they cover a spectrum from Captain America at the one end to Stark.The movie itself is all about ruthless destruction which inevitably leads to massive cold-blooded deaths. A few of the deaths are heartbreaking to the viewer, but why aren't they all heartbreaking.Governments in the Marvel universe now begin to see that the Avengers are often as dangerous to civilians as the villains they oppose.Today's media entertainment is about action at the expense of everything else. And money is their only morality."

Dir: Joss Whedon
Runtime: 2 hr 21 mins
Rated: PG-13Synopsis: When Tony Stark attempts to create a peacekeeping program call Ultron, to protect the Earth, the AI becomes self aware and enacts a disastrous plan. It's up to Earth's mightiest heroes to stop him.Originally I watched this I believe two or three times in theaters. Loved every minute of it but after going back and really watching the film there's a handful of things that I can nit pick at now. All things considered on where the MCU has gone and finally ended it's a really important part to completing the story.Pretty much instead of using the standard story of Ultron like from the comics in which Dr. Hank Pym is the creator of Ultron the story uses the aftermath of what happened in prior years in New York from the first Avengers film to propetuate Tony Stark into thinking that Earth needs a peacekeeping program to protect the Earth in the case that another foe from space comes down to attack the Earth again. Consumed by wanting to protect the Earth and the idea that a program will be able to stop such a thing Tony stops at nothing to try and create Ultron. In doing so he accidentally creates a self aware program that realizes that the only threat to the Earth is people.
There's a few choices that could have been made here that I guess would have helped with the film. The storyline itself has a few moments that are a bit of a plot hole but not too much to where it no longer makes sense. I would have had Alan Silvestri do the score how it usually is in Avengers films. Don't get me wrong I like Danny Elfman but I feel like Avengers films aren't really his cup of tea. Of course all characters are portrayed rightfully with Marvel being able to re obtain all the original actors for the franchise. The element between Hulk and Widow I suppose is needed because in later movies it plays more into Hulk's story. I guess it's just kind of weird how they went about it. A little unexpected but you can tell that since the first film and the Avengers working together over time that the ""lullaby"" has been mastered now. I think my favorite part about this film is the villain, after seeing this so many times Ultron has really became one of my favorite MCU villains.I already own this movie, def a recommendation for anyone trying follow the Infinity arc because it plants some pretty important stuff throughout the film including introduceing new characters.
3.5/5 a high 3.5 at that."
" Too many heroes, too much going on, not enough time for the plot
",0.5106,0.9204,2019-04-29 00:00:00,2,"I'm not a comic book fan, but I liked the earlier stories like Captain America, the Hulk, typically involving one key character and their story. This had too many characters all trying to be centre of attention, far too much going on, it felt like a mess of a film. Lot's of great CGI and explosions and stuff, but without a coherent story to follow I found this film tedious."
" More development? Yeah okay
",0.5635,0.9873,2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Age of Ultron is a great sequel to the original Avengers but not quite better than it. It fits very nicely with the other phase two MCU films in that it serves to not only introduce new and complex characters, but to also allow for growth. This movie very clearly teaches the Avengers as a group that they must work together and be honest with each other in order to have the best chance of succeeding. The villain, while not terribly clever, does run with a plan and has morals that make sense. It is always good to have a villain that believes what they are doing is right. The stakes, while not alien level of dangerous, still feel impactful and provide tension. This movie also features maybe the best scene in the MCU when we get to clearly see the cast as friends instead of just heroes.SPOILERS: I find it amazing that this movie manages to introduce us to a new character, turn him to the good side, and then kill him off all in one movie. I would expect the death to feel less impactful because of those reasons, but it definitely isn't."

Poor wee superhero's all fall out with each and get all sad about being superhero's
It's a wee shame for them. Nobody to talk too, they get awfully upset, then it leads to depression.
This film really highlights the tragedy of being a superhero. And we wouldn't wish that pain on anyone who isn't a superhero.
For I can only imagine how tough it must be to be able to fly, or lift up a heavy hammer or pretty much be invincible.
Oh it's cool actually, they made up with each other, and there all fighting together. Oh that's magic so it is! Good for them. And they've learned something too I'll bet. Something about teamwork and pulling together to defeat the enemy.
I hope they remember this learning curve for the other Avengers films. Maybe write it on the noticeboard or send a group WhatsApp.
Captain Planet or whatever he's called will be the Admin so he can/remove superhero's. He looks like the kind of jobsworth that will not allow daft Gifs though."
" Scarlet Fever
",0.0,-0.7753,2019-04-25 00:00:00,7,"Continuing the ""Endgame"" prep with ""Age Of Ultron"" a film that, somehow in my head is a bit of a misfire. Happy to report that, though this is perhaps the weakest of the three ""Avengers"" films, ""Ultron"" is still a decent film and has a lot of great moments.Haunted by the threats from other worlds that he's seen, Tony Stark wants to replace the Avengers with Ultron, an autonomous artificial intelligence that would protect the Earth. Finally locating Loki's missing spear, he utilises the properties of the Mindstone Infinity Gem to bring Ultron to life. Faulty and psychotic, Ultron decides that the best way to protect the earth would be to rid it of the primitives that inhabit it.I find it really hard to believe that this was only four years ago! It seems like a lifetime. ""Ultron"" gets off to a shaky start, I felt. The battle to capture Von Strucker is a little bit too frantic to be enjoyable, and the CGI occasionally is a little shaky, however, the film really picks up from here and neither of those flaws could be levelled against the rest of the film. Expanding the cast and adding a number of characters who would feature in ""Civil War"" and ""Infinity War"" was done well. The plot points for the whole Infinity Saga is starting to come together too, with Thor learning about the Infinity Stones and realising that someone is behind their recent appearances, perhaps that impacts on this film a little - as Ultron doesn't necessarily feel like the same threat that Thanos is.I can't decide how I feel about James Spader's Ultron. His naturalistic delivery is fun, and often funny, but I'm not sure how realistic it would be for an artificially intelligence to display these sort of mannerisms. Visually he's not quite as good as say Thanos in ""Infinity War"", there's a sheen to the CGI that's not quite dead-on, maybe the moving mouth was a mistake too.The film does have perhaps the single most rewatchable single scene in all the MCU, the battle between Hulk and Ironman in his Hulkbuster outfit. There is lots of good stuff in the final battle scenes also. With hindsight, it's easy to say that it was time for Whedon to move on from the MCU and for the Markus/McFeely/Russos to take the saga forward, and with their writing and direction they have elevated it to another level. But ""Age Of Ultron"" is a really really good film, that would, in any other series, be a highlight. Here's though, it's just a solid addition."
" HAVE EPIC MOMENTS BUT...

No doubt, it is better than first Avengers movie visually. But if we talk about storytelling and deepness of event and new characters, especially after watching Avengers: Infinity War I can't say amazing things. It has so epic moments, especially I hyped so much at final. Tonight Im gonna watch Avengers: Endgame and I wanna thank Marvel Entertainment for making this universe so beautifully.Ps: James Spader is amazing as Ultron."
" Much worse than The Avengers
",-0.4767,-0.7184,2019-04-25 00:00:00,5,I found this film to be much worse than the original grouping of the Avengers although I did think it had some redeeming qualities near the end. The last battle was good and a few characters were introduced and one died trying to help out. That's basically it though. It was a paint by numbers superhero movie that more or less fell flat to me. It did make me look forward to Infinity Wars at the end though.
" Despite Having It's Moments, It Is A Weak Effort
",-0.4404,0.9858,2019-04-17 00:00:00,7,"I just finished Avengers: Age Of Ultron and I have to say, it ranks down the bottom of the pile with Thor 2, Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 3. I enjoyed parts of it, the Hulk V Hulkbuster fight, the Banner/Romanov sub plot, the Hawkeye family, and some of the humour really worked, I especially loved the running joke about Thor's hammer and his face when Cap moved it was great. But overall, I found it lacking!! Especially compared to the brilliant first.All of the cast fit their roles like gloves now, they are all comfortable in the roles and it shows. There is not a weak link, in the cast, but things like the collateral damage to civilian life (during things like Hulk V Hulkbuster) still bothers me. Like Thor: Dark World and Iron Man 3, It seems rushed. Did they start filming all of these without finished scripts?? It would explain things a lot, as they are not as polished as Captain America: Winter Soldier and Guardians Of The Galaxy.Despite that, Age Of Ultron outgrossed both of them."

" Broken characters. Broken pace. Broken villain. Broken, but big.
",-0.8176,-0.9244,2019-04-12 00:00:00,5,"This one doesn't work. It has a lot of potentially awesome things. Ultron could've been an amazing villain with a philosophy (post-humanism, something that X-Men Apocalypse attempted to do as well), a team broken by their worst nightmares (thanks to Scarlett's powers), and the evolution of the team after their ""first mission"" together.
But it just didn't reach the potential.The (a bit) darker story didn't match the light Joss Whedon tone, where everybody speaks with one-liners and witty dialogue (which also sucks, because it makes all the characters pretty much the same thing and it gets old fast).The nightmares were great, but instead of sticking with them, they only helped to break the pace with a bunch of boring angsty scenes that amounted nothing, because the consequences from them were non-existing. Nobody grew from them. Tony's fears made him to commit the same mistake than before (not trusting anybody); Bruce Banner was again weak and even if morally against it, he didn't stop Tony; Hawkeye presented his family, and now we know who he cheated with Black Widow?; Black Widow considered herself a monster because she remembered that she couldn't have kids (what? That makes her the Hulk? What?); Captain America disliked Tony's attitude... again.
Whatever. Ultron was the worst part. He believed in post-humanism (he was that), and yet, the scenes with him were all used to showcase a ""What if Tony Stark were a villain?"" instead. Funny to some, I guess, but terrible for a villain.Another thing that changed too fast? Scarlet and Quicksilver going from villains to heroes. Weak.Having said that, the humor works at times, of course, the action is fun even if the stakes low, and the movie goes fast (other than the halt in the middle)."

Joss Whedon is an excellent story teller but this does not so off his talents at all. Once again this certainly isn't a bad film it just isn't great, there is some good dialogue and the introduction of both Scarlet Witch and Vision is worth seeing."
" This is the worst film in the official Marvel Cinematic Universe!
",-0.3802,0.9445,2019-04-01 00:00:00,2,"After seeing the first ""Avengers"" movie in 2012, I was wondering how they were going to top it with the sequel. Then in 2013, the first teaser trailer came out for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". I thought, ""okay, 'Age of Ultron' is kind of a weak and stupid title, but I won't let it ruin the movie. Who is Ultron?"" I said to myself. I then looked up the character, and I was blown away. Ultron has several cool powers and abilities, and he is indestructible. ""Wow!"" I thought: ""how will the Avengers stop him?!"" Then, I watched the teaser, and the first two official trailers. They were laid out just as I thought, with an ominous tone, and a dramatic soundtrack. The first few trailers were great, it got me excited and hyped to the max for this film. Then came the final trailer, and at that point I slowly began to realize what we were in store for. The music wasn't very dramatic, and it just felt more like a day time television commercial. I thought: ""okay, this trailer is different. Where is the dramatic and ominous tone?"" But, I didn't care, I was still going to see this movie regardless. Boy did I make a mistake! This ""movie"" is stuffed past the brim with one-liners, comedic moments, it hardly followed the original comic book stories, and at no point did I feel any tension whatsoever. I've seen many disappointing films, and this ""movie"" certainly belongs in my ""Top 10 Most Disappointing Movies"" list. I knew before I first saw the film that they changed the original story. In this ""movie"", Hank Pym doesn't create Ultron, Stark does instead. That does not follow the original story. Now of course, some movies can get away with altering the story, but that does not work in this ""movie"". However, Tony Stark does create Vision, that is comic book accurate. That's the only thing they got right in this ""movie"". But as far as Ultron goes, I could not believe how they portrayed Ultron in this ""film"". Ultron is a wuss in this ""movie"", he is practically the polar opposite of his real comic book self. He's supposed to be a cold, calculating, mindless robot. So, why does he have facial features? That moving mouth especially perplexes me, it makes him look more like an alien in a suit of armor. WHY DOES HIS MOUTH MOVE?! Sorry for repeating that question, it's just so retarded. His real character in the comics just has a red light on his face that glows when he speaks. That would've been so much better, because we, as an audience would not be able to tell what he's feeling. In that case, you wouldn't know when he was about to strike! That would have actually brought forth some level of tension for the ""film"". Another thing, when Ultron says: ""I can't physically throw up in my mouth."" (HE MUST BE THINKING ABOUT THE MOVIE ITSELF). That ""joke"" would've actually made sense if he had the glowing red light when he talks instead of that retarded moving mouth. The light would have further clarified that he does not have a mouth, and therefore he cannot throw up. That would have made the joke work, and it would have been funny! Although to be honest, just thinking about this ""movie"" makes me want to throw up. Also, Ultron has next to none of his actual comic book powers, and I was looking forward to see how those awesome powers would be utilized in this ""movie"". But no, we just get a watered down tin foil looking ""thing"". Granted, James Spader is a good choice for the voice of Ultron. What a wasted opportunity! Another thing, the plethora of one-liners in this ""film"" are abysmal, there are so many that it almost doesn't feel real. You know, you'd think after ""Batman & Robin"" (1997) contaminated the Earth with its existence, film studio producers and writers would have learned their lesson! Now, the first ""Avengers"" movie had one-liners too, but there were not nearly as many. It had the right balance between action, comedy, and drama. Unlike the sequel, the one-liners in the first Avengers film are actually funny, but in ""Age of Ultron"" they're not! Also, the acting is all over the place in this ""movie"", some good, some okay, and some bad. The soundtrack is generic, nothing special or original at all. The sets and locations are boring. Sadly, the only good thing in this ""movie"" are the special effects, and that's not saying much. Special effects are usually a given in movies since the mid 19th century. I think that the biggest reason this is my least favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe film is because the movie had so much hype and build-up for over a year, and then it amounted to nothing. Out of all 20 plus movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this one, by far, emotes the most anger out of me. I give it 1 out of 5 stars, which of course equates to 2 out of 10 stars on the IMDB scale. On a final note, in the ""movie"" I wanted to hear one of the main characters say: ""Avengers, assemble!"" Sure it's corny, I know. But, I think it should be warranted in one of these movies. Captain America almost says at the end, but then the end credits cut him off. I was furious! Also, for a title called ""Age"" of Ultron, we didn't even find out how old Ultron was. Yes, that's a joke, I thought that I'd end my scathing review of this ""film"" on a positive, humorous note. The ""age"" of events in this movie take place in just a few days. Whereas an ""age"" can range from a year or longer, so the title doesn't make any sense! Nothing in this ""movie"" makes sense. Stay away from this ""movie"", watch the first ""Avengers"", or ""Avengers: Infinity War"" instead!"

It was the culmination of all the super hero films that made up the MCU, a franchise that helped put Marvel on the map in the box office as a major studio to content with and win over DC and allowed Disney to buy Marvel so that DIsney could distribute its movies for profit. It also ended Phase One. Phase Two has Age of Ultron, which features the main character, an evil robot like creature, sent by Thanos to kill the Avengers.

The cast just gets more star studded, all bringing great performances. Joss Whedon is just the best at crafting his stories and because he is such a fanboy of his subject we get lots nice little touches, like the machine (Ultron) that needs an audience (first the Twins and later the Black Widow) and the twist on who is worthy to weld Mjolnir (Thor's Hammer). The stop action montages are beautifully crafted (I wanted to say they are 'rad', but I didn't want to be accused of age appropriation). There is a wonderful balance of big grand moments and nice little personal moments and still the trademark wit that sets the tone.

I did not like Ultron at all, he was acting to formal in many situations, often comical without need, the CGI used on him was too much and somehow he lacked an identity for me. On the other hand, Vision looked weird, but I guess that is what he looks like according to the comics, but acted nicely, kept his promise when the world needed those kind of words the most, altho he was also a bit to much formal at times.

" Lackluster sequel
",0.0,0.3986,2019-01-15 00:00:00,7,"Once again, Earth faces an existential threat and all that stands between us and extinction are 'Earth's Mightiest Heroes'. This time we hapless humans are faced with 'Ultron', the verbose metal-manifestation of Tony Stark's software solution to world-peace gone rogue. Lacking the spark and cleverness of the first Avengers film, this sequel covers much the same ground, as the team squabbles amongst themselves, then come together when they are needed most. The usual superhuman crew (introduced in solo films or the first entry in the franchise) are opposed/joined by a couple of Eastern European meta-humans (complete with Boris and Natasha accents), 'Red Witch' and her brother 'Quicksilver'. Elizabeth Olsen looks great as the telekinetic Red Witch but her abilities are so vaguely powerful that it's hard to imagine why she alone can't solve most of the problems. Also new on the scene is 'Vision' (also vaguely all-powerful), in whom is embedded one of the MacGuffins around which next film in the franchise circles ('the excellent ""Infinity Wars"", 2018). 'Age of Ultron' is a step down from the first Avengers film: the story is illogical (see goofs section) yet predictable, the script weaker (especially the endless (and sometimes incongruous) ""lighthearted"" banter between the übermensch), and the villain more irritating than menacing. The special effects are pretty good (although the film opens with a gamey-looking battle between the team and Hydra minions), as is the acting (considering the genre). While I got a little tired of Tony Stark's incessant 'droll egotist' shtick, it does play well against Steve Roger's 'greatest generation' decency and Thor's demigod literalness, and Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, the ultimate in ego/id incompatibility. The pacing of the film is a bit off, especially the prolonged layover in Hawkeye's Norman Rockwellesque farmhouse (and why you would use your family's home as a 'safe house' when at war with a near-omniscient foe is beyond me). All in all: OK as a segue in the 'Infinity Stones' story arc but a bit weak as a standalone feature."
" Special Effects Action
",0.4019,-0.4215,2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"9 May 2015. Heavy on special effects and action and light on thoughtful, intelligence. There are the requisite twists and deaths and relational pairings. Ironman's dry humor continues to balance the onslaught of violence that echoes of Kill Bill Vol. No 1 (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). What's new and interesting is the slight advancement of 3-D imagery and the introduction of the creative ways of destroying things. There are few new characters that add a dash of freshness.Overall, though there are a few dead zones, Ultron's actor's familiar voice can be a bit distracting and other then the action there doesn't seem to be much new or hugely interesting about this movie. Mostly creatively more of the same."

As the new force is much fearsome than expected, the Avengers must overcome their differences and try to work together, especially when two new ""modified"" characters seem to join the other side.As it is an Avengers movie, you pretty much get what you were looking for. Plenty of great and very well-known characters, each with their own traits and charisma, whose forces combine into a lot of action-packed scenes which generate plenty of thrill and of course, awesomeness! It's one of those movies which make every child's dreams come true. It's quite hard to miss when you put such great superheroes into one movie and it surely didn't. The acting is also a very positive aspect as the also very well-known actors play their parts flawlessly but also contributing substantially to the great atmosphere that the movie is able to create.The story it features is quite good, but as far as I'm concerned, it represents the downside of this movie, or better said, the only part which made it shy of the maximum rating. Don't get me wrong, it's far from bad, but you get the feeling that it could have done a lot more in order to make the movie truly great. Its predictability in some cases and its linearity in others kind of spoil the overall great sensation that the movie brings.In terms of visuals, you can barely find something to dislike. It looks so good, the stunts and their filming angles make it look great while maintaining a realism factor. The CGI is also top-notch, making almost everything you can imagine a reality. Thus, it gets a big appreciation from me regarding this department.As a conclusion, I can say that it's a movie worthy of the Avengers franchise which delivers what it promised to but was a bit dragged down by its story. Nevertheless, it's a movie which deserves to be seen without any doubt."

",-0.5848,0.9922,2018-12-29 00:00:00,8,"COME ON!!! This was a movie with such potential. It was thought of with good intentions, but was built incorrectly. Not badly, just incorrectly.
An example of why I thought of this is because of Ultron's intention. It would've been much better if Ultron actually did what he was programmed to do: protect humans. I mean, if Ultron couldn't kill humans, this would present a conflict that Ultron needs to get past to accomplish his goal. Other than that, here is how I rated this movie:Cast - 7 -> The cast is quite amazing. They make this story-wise terrible movie half-decent.
Story - 5 -> Like I 've said, the story was built terribly, but with good intention, therefore it gets a higher rating than it might've gotten.
CGI - OVER 9000!!!! (9) -> Let's just not get into this. It's great. Period.

The film develops the Hulk/Black Widow romance and Captain America uses a swear word or two. There is some humorous banter as you would expect, but not at the level it was in past films.

" Disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.9621,2018-11-17 00:00:00,7,"After my terrible review of the first Avengers i'll review the second Avengers movie.
The movie was overwhelming to say the least and disappointing.
This movie failed to meet my expectations and im kinda disappointed cause all it ended up being was a movie similar to it's predecessor.
It manages to be a good movie i was almost about to rate it a 6/10 but it has flaws and i will address does flaws.CHARACTERS
The characters are great and we get to see their personality shine throughout this movie.
The part where we where at Clint's house was a good part in the movie where we got to see the characters act and we also give more depth to Clint and we see that Clint is just a normal human being like all of us and i really like how they made these characters more down to earth.
Thor's character didn't get to shine as much as the others which is kind of a flaw.
And Vision just made the movie more overwhelming. It's good to have him but there are other ways to put him in the movie.ACTION
The action is still great and it still holds up.
The Avengers working together as a team is great and fun to watch and i don't have a lot to say about the action.SIMILAR
Now to the flaws.
This movie was similar to the last one.
What it should have been was a very different movie that has originality to it and way more depth than any other movie in this universe but it failed to do that.
it's just Avengers 2012 with robots.
in the end there is this huge fight with loads of enemies and the world nearly ending but the difference is that in this movie its way overwhelming cause it has so many things it needs to focus on.VILLAIN
The villain is wasted potential Ultron could have been a great villain with depth but all got ruined by Nick fury saying that Ultron's goal is to destroy the world.
I was so disappointed when they Nick said that.
The villain has character problems idk if it is intentional but at one moment he is a little bit charismatic and in the other he is very dark and serious.
The villain is just bad and disappointing to me.VERDICT
You should watch this movie cause it's pretty good but it's overwhelming.
overall a dissapointment.
I will review the third movie when i have time and i have watched it but i don't remember anything so i will rewatch it."

The special effects are at their best when Mark Ruffalo's character turns into The Hulk. While the movie has a lot of heart, its dialogue is weak and far less engaging than the action scenes. Also, attempts at wit rarely succeed.It can still be a fun outing as long as one doesn't expect too much."
" A true super hero team

The direction is really good. The screenplay is really good. The casting is incredible and so is the acting. The acting is incredible no one actor really stands out which is really good from a ensemble perspective. It is really cool to add to the ensemble by adding the voice of James Spader. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.

Don't look too closely at the plot, though, or you'll see plenty of holes. Plus, when you have so many jokes in a movie, some are bound to miss. The first movie is the better one, but this is a good (and somewhat darker) continuation of The Avengers' story."
" On rewatch, not as bad as I remember
",0.431,0.9965,2018-10-31 00:00:00,7,"I only watched this once, so the rewatch was pretty fresh. I agree with many people that some of the storytelling, humour, the character of Ultron and some characters' motivations are a bit off. But that's something that you can expect from Joss Whedon when he's TOO in control.For this film, he had many guidelines for what Marvel wanted to see in this sequel and some of the decisions were OK. This movie is not as bad as people say, I quite enjoyed it the second time round.The criticism that many people would agree on is to introduce the character of Hank Pym as a side character, have HIM create Ultron just like in the comics and the Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon, then when he turns up again in the Ant-Man movie that follows this film, he could redeem himself by handing over his Ant-Man persona to an ex-convict and helping to redeem Scott Lang in response to what Hank did with Ultron. I think that would have worked a lot better.Overall, this isn't as bad as people say. It has great moments like Hawkeye being given more deeper character development, the introduction of Vision, the fight between Hulk and the Hulkbuster armour and the dynamic between each of the Avengers. The fact that they are starting to get on better really makes me happy and hopeful."

The crux of the plot felt like a weak way to generate a dramatic threat to the world. I had a few raised eyebrows as it unfolded. Tony Stark recklessly creates a program called Ultron to protect the world and fails to run quality assurance on the code. ZING. The program launches to life and immediately is out for no good. Now all the Avengers must chip in to help destroy it, while giving Tony Stark light grimaces. There's your plot. So this computer intelligence, Ultron, Stark whipped up that is malfunctioning wants to turn the world to metal and destroy all the humans.

Those unacquainted with the film series will not get its full effect from the limited backstory. It runs a bit too fast in parts too, in particular the disposing of foes, which at times looks like tossing garbage in the bin rather than proper fight sequences involving people to engage with.

",0.0,0.7153,2018-07-13 00:00:00,6,"A clear step-down from the first, 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' is for the most part a mess. The characters aren't as well-written as the first, the pacing is poor, the story is pretty generic, and the film's action isn't even all that entertaining. On the flip side, the villain is unique, there are some good character moments and the inclusion of Scarlett Witch makes for some interesting scenes. However, these things can't elevate this film to more than 'good enough'. It's definitely not terrible and it's adequately made, but it just feels as if something is lacking to make us care more about the plot and characters. The film is certainly watchable, but it does nothing special to set it apart and therefore ends up being only a little more than average. There are worse superhero films out there, but considering that this is an 'Avengers' film, it can't help but feel like a let-down. 6/10"
" Good Sequel but too focused on franchise building
",0.6542,0.7299,2018-07-09 00:00:00,7,"Following the events of The Winter Soldier, the Avengers infiltrate a Hydra facility where they come across twins who have superhuman powers. It starts off big, loud and over-the-top, complete with a slow-mo money shot of the team. Big opening scenes like this are usually a risk as they can make the rest of the film feel underwhelming. Thankfully that isn't the case here because it's filled with relentless action sequences throughout. A few standout moments include a penthouse surprise attack, an enraged Hulk destroying a city and a chase scene in Korea. Some of the action scenes have choppy editing but the majority are well shot where we can see what is going on. The plot centres around Tony Stark/Iron Man who creates AI robot Ultron. To disastrous results he becomes an evil version of Stark hellbent on destroying the world. Perhaps their hardest obstacle yet, he's intelligent and always one step ahead of them. He uses the super twins as his pawns whilst also using his own robotic army to wreak havoc on everyone else. James Spader steals the show, he is intimidating, creepy and often amusing. It's a little more grounded this time as the Avengers try their best not to cause any civilian casualties as they know it will only have repercussions. It also has a darker palette which makes it look better than the previous film which was very colourful and bright. The dark tone isn't for everyone but it works well within the story. There are some grim moments including one scene where they all get warped visions of their past. It's full of exciting action set pieces which take us to other places in the world rather than just the US. It's not without flaws though, there are a few new characters introduced which makes it feel overstuffed. It loses focus sometimes because there are so many subplots -Natasha suddenly has a crush on Bruce Banner, Clint/Hawkeye has a secret family and Stark learns nothing from his mistakes deciding to make another robot midway through. However one good thing about delving into Hawkeyes personal life (everyone's least favourite Avenger) isn't a bad move and makes us root for him. But there are just one too many character storylines which the film could have done without. The final showdown is great showing them working as a team to stop Ultron from destroying the world. But like most comic book films, it wraps things up too fast."

A group of diverse heroes forced to unite for the common goal, a charismatic villain at the head of a crowd of faceless clones ... It's not that we would not see it, or we did not want to look again ... And it looks like Joss Weedon knows all the pitfalls in itself a sequel. It is no longer necessary to tell the stories of the main characters (just like last time, actually), and we do not even need to disclose the reasons for their interactions, and therefore the movie tells the stories of the characters who were deprived of attention last time. Altron is a jerk, he sings songs, runs over himself and avengers, sincerely not understanding why they are needed, if he is - all such in vibnium. And the Scarlet witch and Mercury, having lost the status of mutants, contributed a huge share of diversity to the action and history, not to mention that there are not many sympatians in the frame.The narrated story serves as a flip bridge to the further development of the cinematic universe, but it was done in a large and effective way, being a worthy continuation of the first part. Joss Weedon thus secured us with you, yourself and the co-owners of the need for the third part and the story of the same story for the third time. Wisely, considering that the history of cinema has repeatedly proved that the same approach in a trickle does not work in ninety-five percent of cases.
One way to hide the roughness and surpass the original is an action, and it was brought here with a surplus. Beginning exactly with what the original ended - the interaction of the Avengers as one, one-piece team, shown by one shot, the second part thus hints that there will be even more. And, believe me, ""The Age of Altron"" does not disappoint, and the viewer will receive a huge amount of beauty and effects, the performance of which is honed in all the previous parts of the universe. Well, we will not forget that this is Marvel - there will be plenty of humor, and even the hammer of the torah will become a real joker.The second phase of the cinematographic universe is coming to an end, and the result of its evolution was presented to the audience. This is no longer a novelty, but no one promised, honestly on the heart. ""The era of the Altron"" - an ideal blockbuster, which is the result of the development of entertainment movies.This is not a streaming production, it's not an attempt to keep up with someone, or to prove to someone something - it's a one-off product, quality and collected manually. Not creativity, not invention, not art. Quality of manual assembly, that's all."

The film tries giving us too much stuff, ultimately giving us a fun ride, that wasn't what was promised but still enjoyable. With a standout performance From James Spader none the less."
" Better than the first one
",0.4404,0.4118,2018-05-24 00:00:00,8,The ambition of Tony Stark is well illustrated in this film. They should have showed how they discovered how to turn Hulk to Bruce Banner with Natasha Romanof.

",-0.3412,0.8824,2018-05-21 00:00:00,6,"I thought it was kind of disappointing. Some of the action scenes were fun, but it had too many additional superheroes and the story was typical for a Sci fi movie: Robots invading and destroying Earth. I wanted to like it, but the first had more action and laughs and was paced better. Some of this dragged. It had some cool stuff, but the original had a more interesting story because the superheroes hadn't met before, so those interactions were unpredictable and fun. This seemed too familiar. No, it was similar to other Sci fi movies like Matrix and Terminator where robots are destroying mankind. It continues the first, but Nick Fury is given nothing to do, Thor acts more ""normal"" I guess, it had a few big action scenes, but not as many as the first. It had more superheroes though."

So this one is the worst avenger movie out of the three. I love Marvel but this movie isn't good, not as bad as dark world though."

The heroes come off the page so well in this second film featuring the Avengers.
After the first one which was mostly introductory and formation, this film offers the Avengers in their prime and flourishing as a team.
Because the cast is so big, each hero (and villain) gets adequate time to shine and really develop in this film. Especially Hulk and Black Widow.
Ultron is a believable and entertaining villain upping the stakes as the film moves forward.
Joss Whedon is here to stay, his direction and vision for the MCU is without a doubt unbeatable.
Cinematography and SFX were flawless and the scene where each member of the Avengers attempt to pick up Thors hammer after a night of partying will stick in my memories for a long time.
The plot really sets up well for future installations of upcoming Avenger members and the 3rd installment Infinity War.

" A derivative and dull follow-up that loses the focus on character and is ultimately just bland.
",-0.6124,0.8281,2018-04-29 00:00:00,6,"'Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015)' is not the follow-up you, or director Joss Whedon, would expect and is honestly a derivative and dull experience clearly damaged by callous studio interference. This tampering transformed an already messy picture into a downright boring one. The character focus that made the first stand out, and that is key to the success of the best Marvel movies (as well as the best movies in general) is essentially gone, with each player practically caricatures of their former selves with weak motivations and barely any time or ability to convey them. The focus is placed almost entirely on the admittedly visually pleasing smashy-bashy finale that isn't as deserved this time and therefore isn't as compelling, being even more lifeless than the exposition sequences that will confuse even those who have seen all the prior titles. It's difficult to explain why at times I was just so bored, despite all that was unfolding on screen. And yet that is certainly the case, and the feeling just worsened with time to the point where I was tired upon the title's completion. The picture isn't terrible, it's certainly not among the worst even Marvel have to offer, but it is bland. 6/10"
" Better then the first one.

",0.7717,0.9745,2018-04-28 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed watching this movie though it could've been a lot better. I mainly enjoyed it because it involved one of my favourite supervillains ever - Ultron! I just like how bad Ultron looks and appears in the Avengers though I still think he has been mismanaged, and that's one of the main reasons why I think the movie didn't go well with many people. Ultron is one of ""The Avengers"" greatest enemies, so you would think this movie would've done more to make it appear that way. I feel like this movie should've had two-parts to it, or at least be a lot longer considering the villain it involved. Age of Ultron had all the things needed to be a great superhero movie. Perfect timing for it to be released as well. I remember first seeing the trailer as it first came out, and it looked really awesome. I liked how Ultron sounded: looked like he meant business."
" Simply brilliant!

Only Meronica at the rescue with other avengers under poor condition. Great fighting sequences and imagination. Great to watch."

The acting, effects and cinematography are all pretty good. The problem falls with the story. Its pretty weak. Time is wasted on pointless, boring scenes. In the middle of the movie, there is a 20 minute sequence (that's not an exaggeration) where The Avengers are on a farm. The main villain is a robot. Watching the Avengers fight robots is boring. This movie tries to make nearly every character a comic relief, but there are only a few jokes that actually work. I'm a fan of the Avengers, but this isn't a good movie."

" A slightly weaker sequel to one of the best action movies of all time
",0.3804,0.9815,2018-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Avengers: Age of Ultron stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and James Spader with the rest of the avengers crew as they make and have to defeat the robot, Ultron, before he tries to destroy the world. Writing wise this movie has some of the most memorable lines and scenes of the series. Including the famous party scene and the intro fight scene as well. But sadly this film lacks with it altering the overall story of the comics and it feeling like a rip off of the first Avengers film and even though it decides to take more of a risk with introducing three new characters and giving an explanation of what exactly the infinity stones are and how many exactly there are too. It doesn't stand up to the first one. With Joss Whedon directing this film again like the first one he still kills it. With a bigger budget and the crew ready to go and kick ass is everything that a comic or movie fan wants. With the beautiful use of CGI to make Ultron feel real and relatable with his roboticness makes the directing of this film top notch. The cast once again is amazing. With Spader killing it as Ultron and his soothing yet uneasy voice he uses in it to give life to this robot makes the film memorable in those senses. And Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olson as the twins, they add a new layer to Stark and show that there are a lot more unique people out there than just the 6 we love. And with Renner having more than roughly 26 minutes of screen time like in the first one. We get more depth of him as a person and as an avenger that makes us as an audience love him more. With the script being not as strong as the previous film. This movie still stands up to being a great MCU film and holding some of my personal favorite scenes in the series. Avengers: Age of Ultron gets a 7.25/10"
" Not as good as the previous one
",-0.3412,-0.9202,2018-04-06 00:00:00,7,"I don't hate this movie at all hence I have only gave it an 7 instead of a 10. But it's not as enjoyable as The Avengers movie. First of all in the comics I am pretty sure Hank Pym created Ultron not Tony Stark. Oh and what is this relationship with Black Widow and Hulk/Bruce Banner going on. Have the creators forgot about Betty Ross from The Incredible Hulk. That he was in a relationship with her. If that is the case then I guess The Incredible Hulk movie never happened. So Jarvis is Vision now and FRIDAY takes his place in Iron Man's armor.The goods to come out of the film is the acting, Andy Serikus's introduction as The Klaw, the fight between Hulk and Hulkbuster, the final battle and James Spader as Ultron.I wish they killed Scarlet Witch off instead of Quicksilver because she is just practically useless on the team and well done Disney for abandoning the Hulk on a shield helicarrier. It's a decent movie overall but not as great as the last one."
" Unnecessarily pretentious for a mindless blockbuster
",0.25,-0.9586,2018-03-03 00:00:00,3,"The script was a major dog in this movie. Upon rewatching the film, it's clear these are different characters, not the same ones in the first. There's too much babble in this movie about topics only drugged out college kids and professors would discuss, not real people. It gets absolutely ridiculous after a while. Also, Marvel is hurting their movies having the superheroes be worried about every single innocent person. These heroes would be thanked in real life for their service, not chastised and condemned. Civilians condemn the Avengers for the lives of a few people dying in spite of the fact the villains were either trying to take over the entire world and kill a lot more or outright destroy it completely. It's ridiculous. The humans have no ability to control these superheroes either; they are Gods. They would answer to them, not the other way around. Like most babble from college types, it's just not grounded in reality, but more the result of ultra-privileged, sheltered lives and a lack of a willingness to understand how the average person operates.The CGI model of Ultron was incredibly bad and made it hard to take him seriously. It was cartoonish, a total hack job. There's a reason they largely kept him out of the trailers. Not sure who was responsible for that, corporate hacks or whatever, but it really hurt the film."

" Not perfect, but still an extremely enjoyable superhero flick
",0.509,0.9975,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Avengers 2 starts off very fast-paced - you're already in the midst of a battle and one of the first exchanges is a hilarious back-and-forth between Iron Man (Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Evans). It at once sets the scene for a great action film, but also helps to quickly re-introduce characters and their personalities. It's not essential to have seen the first movie, or even the 'Thor', 'Iron Man' or 'Captain America' films (and even 'Guardians of the Galaxy'), but they definitely help to add another layer of nuance and understanding to some events/characters.The plot is pretty straight forward - Iron Man wants to protect the world by having his automated suits everywhere. This inadvertently creates artificial intelligence, which turns out to be Ultron (Spader) - who wants to protect Earth by helping it to evolve. This obviously involves wiping out the human species! The Avengers can't handle him - and with Scarlet Witch (Olsen) and Quicksilver (Taylor-Johnson/Kick-Ass) on his side (before they see his true intentions) - they have to re-group and learn to all work together again. The introduction of Vision (Bettany) is handled well and is a welcome one for future films.One of the best aspects of this film is the characterisation - each Avenger gets some backstory and exposition, not just fight scenes. Hawkeye (Renner) probably comes off the best here, since he's often overlooked - he is after all just a guy who's a good archer! The Black Widow (Johansson) and Hulk (Ruffalo) 'romance' is odd and new, but doesn't necessarily work. However, it's good seeing Thor (Hemsworth), Iron Man and Captain America work as part of a team - especially when Thor and ""Cap"" combine to take out dozens of enemies at once!
 
Spader's voice is great as the voice of discontent with the human species. While the ending is a little reminiscent of 'Superman Returns', the film takes you on an entertaining ride through the Marvel universe - I still look forward to the next instalment(s)!"

Too many characters/subplots, too many Joss one-liners, too many cliches, too many sanctimonious moments. It was fine, but Marvel's universe sometimes seems to be collapsing under its own weight. Sometimes simple is better, and this was anything but simple."
" Weak attempt at fanservice
",-0.4404,0.6742,2017-11-13 00:00:00,4,"This film is a perfect example of what happens when you're more focused on cramming in references and lead-ups to future films rather than having a cohesive narrative.The Avengers return to take on one of Tony Stark's mistakes: a defence technology gone rogue, taking control of his Iron Man suits and becoming sentient. That's essentially the plot. Also shoehorned in is foreshadowing and allusions to future films such as Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War and Thor: Ragnarok. Our heroes are caricatures of themselves here as very little character development is given for the majority of the film, save for a 'shock reveal' about Hawkeye.We are also shown the most 'out-of-nowhere' romance between Black Widow and the Hulk, which really only exists for people to make fanfiction.Ultron is shown less as an intimidating villain and more as a wise-cracking ass. Barely memorable and his evil plot was completely forgettable.Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson make their debuts as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver respectively, but since Quicksilver was already done by Fox's X-Men, Taylor-Johnson's multi-movie contract was made kinda redundant.The movie attempts to have character bonding scenes at the halfway point, but ultimately, it's just more foreshadowing. This film may have about as much depth as a kid's swimming pool but the visuals are certainly stunning. I think it was around this point where many people were succumbing to 'superhero fatigue', but it's definitely debatable.A lackluster sequel to the first Avengers, and the resulting cause of Joss Whedon's departure from involvement in the MCU."
" Quantity over quality all along
",0.0,-0.9633,2017-11-11 00:00:00,4,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a 2015 superhero movie and the first sequel to the super successful ""The Avengers"". Joss Whedon directs again and he is also among the writing team. The cast includes all the familiar faces like Downey, Johansson, Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Jackson, Renner... but they added some okay names too like Elizabeth Olsen or Sam Taylor-Johnson. The latter 2 play enemies early on, but when they realize what Ultron has really in mind, they quickly change sites. The danger is Avenger-made this time as it's Stark (and Banner) who created this mess that endangers all civilization now. Their intentions may have been noble, but shame that Ultron is not really capable of making a difference between good and evil and between cause of and reaction to violence. So he quickly becomes the Avengers' biggest nightmare. I personally was a bit surprised that Fury did not really teach the two culprits a lesson for what they secretly did. Honestly, everybody except Iron Man who was the initiator would have gotten their fair share of confrontation and criticism.As for the overall quality of this film, I was pretty disappointed I must admit. The film runs for over 2 hours and 20 minutes and while it did not drag too hard admittedly, it all felt so generic and uninspired. It's actually pretty difficult to say what was the weakest about this one. Maybe the constantly desperate attempts at funny one-liners that make even a great actor like SLJ look weak. Then again Nick Fury is definitely not his best role, just his most known perhaps. Or was it how weak the villain felt. They had such an extraordinary actor like James Spader at their disposal and he felt almost completely wasted. I really never felt as if Ultron was menacing enough that they needed everybody to take care of him. And that this would not be enough even. The references about the Avengers with their bond fighting Ultron who had many soldiers, but zero strings felt desperately rushed in to give the fight scenes some deeper meaning. It all felt pseudo and for the sake of it all to me. This was a very bloated movie for sure, delivering from the technical perspective, but only there. Slightly memorable scenes like Hawkeye's family stayed the exception. It was all very shallow and very superficial.And what's even worse, the quantity-over-quality component is in danger of becoming even more crucial as they keep adding more and more characters to the franchise. The result is that forgettable new characters have zero impact almost (did you cry when Quicksilver died? I was closer to cringing to be honest) and the old ones are not showing anything new at all or if they do like the romance part between 2 Avengers here, then it feels somewhat unauthentic to be honest. Besides why is always Renner's character the one getting wounded? Because he's the only one not trained in close combat? Please. Another disappointing repetitive aspect and his joke on mind control did not change things for the better. Hell, even Stan Lee's cameo was nothing extraordinary this time and it felt for the sake of it all like the rest of the film. It was not a failure, but it was a movie where you could comfortably switch off your brain before the start as it won't challenge you whatsoever. Or have you care. And that's one of the worst statements you could make. I will soon see the new Thor movie and I hope they managed to step things up there again. And that they really improve with the upcoming Avengers film that will be released in 6 months or so. If they don't improve, then best would be to discontinue, which they obviously won't do as these films are hits financially as big as it gets. But that obviously doesn't mean their quality is convincing, let alone memorable. This one here is the best example for that. Don't watch."

Ultron was one of the better villains and he certainly deserves a sequel film. Why are people slagging this off? Yes it's different to the first Avengers but even that wasn't the best Marvel film so stop saying it is. Ultron is better than many of the Marvel films. The character was intelligent and hard to beat unlike Loki. For some reason I already knew Hulk despite it being my first Marvel film so the character development deserves credit. The only real problem with the film is that some of the build up is a bit random. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great and they are what we want in the Marvel films, anyone who preferred Loki just because he's Thor's brother needs to rethink. I like Loki but Ultron makes a better villain so Jack Spade needs to make a come back. CGI by the way was awesome, didn't occur to me that people would find destroying Sokolvia an issue until Captain America Civil War. That film basically tells us that the Avengers did a bad job which does ruin the plot slightly. Age Of Ultron 2 would be great. So would reviving Quick Silver"

You're basically watching a duck hunt instead of something suspenseful. They try to hype up how dangerous it is, then each of the Avengers, no matter how powerful, suddenly becomes super powerful when it comes to destroying the enemy. The writers seemed to think that just having an action sequence was enough. That the people watching would just coo over seeing things destroyed. I wanted more.*** Spoiler Ahead ***Okay, then you have the one ""unexpected"" death. Which frankly was dumb. He was easily fast enough to move the targets out of the way and instead chooses to shield them with his body. I can only assume he was tired of living and wanted to commit suicide. It just made no sense.Then you have the dramatic reactions to the death ... during the battle ... while civilians are still dying and you're still fighting ... for someone you basically just met. I realize this is common in movies. I just don't like it.I don't want to make it sound like this is a 2 rating or something like that. The movie is still has the marvel heroes and it still creates a pretty good setting. It's just pretty pale when compared to the original, hence a 6."

" You Can't Think About This Movie
",0.0,0.993,2017-10-08 00:00:00,5,"OK, I'm going to preface this review by saying that overall I am a fan of the MCU and I think they've given the world a fair few really good movies and the remaining ones are almost always OK. That feat is something that is commendable and something that I doubt will ever be recaptured over a series that has this many movies in it. Now that that is out of the way let's get our hands dirty. Avengers: Age of Ultron is a dumb movie. That in of itself isn't a damning thing really, a lot of great movies are dumb and rely more on emotions to connect the audience to the plot but in this movie the emotional connection is very scarce which is pretty unforgivable for a movie nearly 2.5 hours in length. There are two emotional parts to the movie which are both short parts to the film that I found to be much more engaging and relatable than the rest of the movie as a whole and I would be much more interested in an MCU movie that simply expanded on them. These two parts being the party where the Avengers are all hanging about and interacting in a way that reminded me that these actors are actually all really talented. like seriously, who here forgot that this cast has been nominated for a combined 9 Oscars? Anyway the other scene is where the group spends a few days isolated on one of their members property. Once again I'd love to see an entire movie focused solely on these characters and how they get along but we will never get that film so oh well. The action in the movie is good if not a little too clean for a movie in which there is a explosive highway chase, a flying city and a derailed train but this is technically a Disney flick so I'll let it slide. The thing that I do not intend to let slide is the emotional manipulation that the movie tries to pass of to its audience. I find it pretty absurd that the same people who have accomplished so much with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and even Dr. Strange are willing to turn in such canned and phony plot beats and call it an Avengers movie. I mean the first movie even has a scene that perfectly explains exactly what this movie tries to un-ironically accomplish (the scene with the bloody trading cards if you were wondering). It is really something that stops me every time I think about re watching this movie because it irks me too much. Every single new character is treated with the same level of tragic backstory as a middle-schooler's OC in a fanfiction, its pathetic.But at the end of the day if you are willing to simply go into a movie and be satisfied with people punching things to solve their problems then you will be fine with this movie. Just try not to think about it too much, you may accidentally put more thought into it than the writers."

" One of the worst blockbuster movies ever made
",-0.0516,0.8295,2017-09-24 00:00:00,2,"The avengers: age of ultron is one of the laziest, most uncreative, lackluster and poorly thought-out sequels to ever exist. The fact that this film got such positive reviews and many defenders of it astounds me. Just like its original predecessor, this movie is almost plot less. It has the most basic plot that you can imagine. The kind of plot that the likes of Michael Bay uses in his transformers movies. Just a sarcastic robot who wants to destroy humanity for vague reasons. (Once again, another awful MCU villain, but then again, its no surprise) And is also bastardized in the movie and treated as a joke. The avengers team could not be more bland and uninspiring in this movie. Not as bland as the first one, but close. Ironically, the most human character out of them all was vision, and that partially is due to a solid performance from Paul Bettany, not the writing. The other characters are extremely dull. Black widow, Thor, Cap, Bruce and all are extremely boring who lack heart and depth. Especially captain America. Which is a shame, considering he is the leader of the group and is supposed to be inspiring. The film is also poorly choreographed and shot. The film making felt incredibly amateurish for a supposed professional director. The action sequences were laughably atrocious, albeit entertaining. Some scenes were incredibly horrendous, that they felt like a video game sequence. In fact, video game cut scenes make a better movie than this. There were many scenes that felt forced and its only purpose is to just advertise upcoming movies (some that won't even happen).And just like its predecessor, the movie lacks any kind of heart and emotion. This is because it only wants to focus on dull humor and mindless, poorly constructed action scenes. Instead of having actual good writing that develop the characters as human beings, they are just mindlessly working together and banter with each other. Why even bother with making the cabin scene if they don't eventually evolve? Now some may think I am taking this way too seriously, since some people say this movie is JUST for fun. But if the comics had so much heart, creativity and soul, why the film can't have that? Oh yeah because the MCU needs safe choices in order to have guaranteed success. No need to have challenging themes or artistic merit, only soulless action garbage to keep you busy for a couple of hours."

",0.8519,0.9134,2017-09-04 00:00:00,7,"AGE OF ULTRON is the second of the assembled Avengers movies, following on from the exemplary AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. This one's a lesser film by definition, although it still packs in enough endless action sequences and CGI spectacle to take your mind off the problems with the plot and scripting. There really isn't too much to say now in a review of a film of this calibre, as the previous comments stand. The action is hard-hitting, well-choreographed, and breathless, with the huge budget being put to great use in the depiction of colossal events. Mark Ruffalo is the most valuable player, as usual, with Scarlet Johansson close behind, although my personal favourite is newcomer Elizabeth Olsen who has a storm as Scarlet Witch. AGE OF ULTRON is the typical summer blockbuster, a film that virtually demands you switch off your brain and just sit back and enjoy."

",0.2244,-0.8403,2017-08-25 00:00:00,5,"Simply, it's The Avengers (2010) on steroids, red bull, and LSD! We have the same heroes, yet with additional ones, an army of CG shots, too much action it's going to make you sick, and the hugest amount of twaddle, prattle, and babble you'll ever experience. Well, dear writer / director Joss Whedon, excessiveness is no virtue!The action sequences run so snappily as if The Flash directed them. It's like riding a loose roller-coaster, I was shouting ""Please, make it slower!"". Whether somebody pressed the Fast-Forward button while Play is on, or it has the most irrational editing of 2015 (Here's a challenge for you: Try to find Julie Delpy in this movie!).Once the action is over, the dialogue is endless to the extent where you feel, rather live the fact, that this is a talk show more than an action movie. Bore was a superhero in this movie, and he killed it. When I recall that 15 minutes sequence in the movie's middle, where they go to the safe house, I fall asleep instantly. GOD! It's where The Avengers meets Little House on the Prairie!!There was some relief, scary one. The tragedy is that the comic one-liners were horrible, and delivered horribly as well. No actor cared to be a bit funny while performing them. They're all in rush, forgetting to give an iota of ""feeling"" along the way. Actually, the performance got robotic sometimes, look at Captain America, Thor and Stark while their talk right before the ending, they were phoning in their lines in incredible frigidity!Like the first movie, the evil guy's soldiers are still alike, and so easy to kill. Speaking of continuous downsides from the first movie, I'm still asking: What Hawkeye and Black Widow have to do with The Avengers in the first place?! THEY'RE NOT SUPER ANYTHING FOR GOD'S SAKE! And for a new downside, that maybe will continue in next movies; They made Captain America curse!!And then we get to the LSD issue. Yes, I mean the character of ""Vision"". Who is that guy? And how he's even born? So Stark is capable of CREATING people now??!!As for any pros, the CGI and all of the imaginative details were excellent and enjoyable.Sadly, Whedon had a lust for too much speaking, too fast action, producing heavy exhaustion in a form of a movie. I was shocked when knew that the first Avengers movie ran for 2 hours and 23 minutes, and this one ran for 2 hours and 21 minutes. The shock wasn't that this one is shorter; it was that it feels like 3 days already! To tell you the bitter truth, I slept in front if it 3 times. THREE TIMES!! It didn't happen with any other movie, not to mention a supposedly entertaining blockbuster. So I had to re-watch it, while fighting sleep, to write these words.The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron mixed Marvel's lead characters, and good action sequences, with DC's grittiness, and serious drama mambo jambo, and the result is unbearable fat movie. If I went to watch it for a third time, I believe my computer would cry entreating for help, or at least shutdown itself out of fatigue!"
" Avengers......ASSEMBLE!!!!!

The movie was awesome, the Avengers were more focused as a team rather than individuals, and they have been developed from their last appearance with more interaction between characters and more action in fight scenes. The villain was perfect, Ultron posed a deadly threat which in his viewpoint was simply a mission he must enact. This directly adopts Ultron's persona from the comics which was also such a malevolent character. The story felt unorthodox but great seeing as this is a team-up movie and not a solo film. It was really awesome to see that Ultron had this weird idea that he was right and his plan, ultimately, was a huge surprise to both fans and moviegoers. The actors and actresses did their job well. In addition, Elizabeth Olsen's character was good but Aaron's Quicksilver needed more screen time, Hawkeye was done some justice by appearing as a mentor to Olsen's character. All in all, 10 out of 10 is the rank I will give this epic showstealer. Go watch it for sure."

" Not nearly as good as the first.
",-0.3412,-0.9819,2017-06-26 00:00:00,6,"Age of Ultron is the sequel to ""The Avengers"". And I can assure you, that movie was a lot better. Age Of Ultron is not a good movie. Is it a bad movie? NO! Is it a good movie? NO! It is a disappointment, not even close to how good the first was, and a overrated excuse for a film! I will give a list of pros and cons.Pros:1. It is a competent enough movie. Almost all the cgi is good, the fight scenes are also usually good, and it doesn't feel rushed or anything. It is competent.2. Hawkeye is made better. Hawkeye, the weakest character in the first one, is the only strong character in this one. I actually care about him now, he has development now, and his actor is good in this movie as well.3. The first twenty minutes are good.Cons:1. Bad performances. All of the actors suck in this movie, with the exception of Hawkeye. The worst two by far are, Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor Johnson. Both of their Russian accents are bad. Like really bad. My best German accent sounds more Russian than their Russian ones. 2. Aaron Taylor Johnson. Seriously the guy is a bad actor. He hasn't had a single good performance yet, and he probably never will. The guy is the worst part of every movie he is in. Seriously, I've seen better actors on Barney.3. Ultron. Ultron is bad. You expect him to be a cold, brutal, intelligent villain. But he is like almost every other character in this movie. CRACKING A JOKE EVERY FEW MINUTES! Its horrible. Ultron was a disappointment.4. The forced in love story. Black Widow and Hulk are horrible together. They weren't like this in the first movie, and in this one it is cheesy. AND IT FEELS FORCED!5. The Final Fight: Boring and bland. The only thing they fought were robots. The only thing I was worrying about was Quicksilver and Ultron surviving. And thankfully, neither did.Final Verdict:6.3/10 (Above Average)It is mediocre, and only slightly better than movies like Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman. Major disappointment, it should've been a 8/10 at the minimum. A movie I would recommend instead is, ""The Avengers""."

There are many critical comments about this movie because of the attempt Marvel has made - to show the human part of superheroes.

Even the compassion I think many of us can feel to Pietro and Wanda..This is a very beautiful movie because of these moments.The best scene of the movie was the family of Hawkeye, - the only shelter of Avengers... and Clint Barton finally had a very deep and great part of the team here ... I love this movie exactly because of it - no superheroes but just humans like us... the message is very good.P.S. And Scarlett is amazing like always)) the more I watch Avengers movies the more I feel sorry for Bruce and want them to be together. Mark Ruffalo is very good and convincing)))"
" Joss Whedon needs a hug; Would Recommend
",0.6808,0.9994,2017-05-24 00:00:00,7,"'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the second feature film in the MCU's 'Avengers' franchise and was directed by Joss Whedon. It stars Tony Stark Jr, Chris Evans and James Spader and is the story of Ultron(James Spader), a psychotic robot created by Robert Downey Jr and Bruce Banner to stop all wars before they even begin.It was impossible for this movie to live up to the absurdly high hype that came of off 'Avengers Assemble' and the other MCU movies. It really was but I still feel that people were too harsh on Joss Whedon. Seriously, the guy needs a hug. He was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't reach the heights of one of the best movies of 2012. I feel bad for the guy. He made a fun, action packed movie with a stellar cast and fun villain but was manhandled by smaller people? Oh children that's right I forgot the word there for a second. In all seriousness, this movie is very entertaining and fun is you can ignore the absurd plot and tropes carried over from movie to movie. Speaking of absurd plot, the plot is absurd. The term 'Age' implies 2000+ years of something, not a week. The concept of Ultron was really cool and they could have made a very creative(and possibly, if they did it right, satirical) doomsday device that involved our mass reliance on technology and the internet. They do try to cram a LOT into one movie and fail miserably at it. It think this was a Feige issue and not a Whedon issue because he has said how many restrictions and guidelines he had to follow and that undoubtedly interfered with his vision for this movie. Something happens in this movie that should have meant a lot but it doesn't have as much of an impact as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential. Right, let's get the obvious out of the way. Tony Stark is excellent as Roberty Downey Jr. Downey Jr is just such a charismatic guy and he makes Stark a very memorable character. This is only heightened by Chris Evan's much better performance of Captain America. There is more back and fourth between Evans and Stark than there was in the Korean War. Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow, as was Mark Ruffallo as Bruce Banner but the 'relationship' between the two felt so forced and contrived and had little to no buildup to make it successfully work. Chris Hemsworth was good as Blondie but I feel like his presence was neither necessary nor warranted. Jeremy Renner as good as Hawkeye and the wonderful producers at Marvel Studios decided we needed a reason to like him so that when he kicks the bucket in Infinity War we'll actually give one(I refuse to count that as profanity). Elizabeth 'Hand Wavy' Olsen was weak as Scarlett Witch as her 'superior acting method' consisted of doing stuff with her hands in the air and, occasionally forging an accent. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did better as her 'brother' Quicksilver but his purpose was to be there and not for anything else. Paul Bettany was great as his character in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise. Plus, dat hamma scene tho. Now for arguably the most controversial part of this movie, Ultron. I understand that Ultron wasn't as menacing as people wanted him to be but I appreciated Spader's approach to the character. Having him share similar qualities to that of his maker(Robert Downeyy Jr) was an excellent choice and gave further levels to the character. He was definitely one of the better MCU villains but that is like saying something is one of the better ways to get stabbed. Once more, I adore Whedon's beautiful cinematography and his long, unedited tracking shots and stunning to behold. On the flip side of that argument, while some scenes(such as the opening sequence) were amazingly shot and edited, scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly. The effects were amazing and looked awesome(I wouldn't say they looked as impressive or cool as 'Avengers Assemble' but that is just my opinion). I do think the set design was pretty generic and they could have done quite a bit more with it to make it appear more lively. This movie needed to provide some fun action, fun humour and set up ((37*(x**40)) + (π*407³)(Have fun maths nerds!) movies in the process. The action is very fun and arrives when it's needed. Amidst the incredible action, there is also deep, heartfelt character moments and some of them worked. The one liners were most funny but some of them were were very profanity filled and that is offensive to Cap/Disney. As for setting up movies, it does to that but it could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better. Another thing this movie had to do was involve stakes but it doesn't feel like it does that. This is a glaring issue with MCU movies and hopefully they'll fix this in 'Infinity War'. The music was very good. In conclusion, this movie is not as good as 'Avengers Assemble' or 'The Winter Soldier' or even 'Iron Man' but it is a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of MCU movies. The cast is still stellar and Whedon proved he direct action competently with his other movies. If you want a fun way to spend your two hours, I will recommend you see this movie because it is very fun and enjoyable to watch.7/10"
" A Wasted Chance To Make An Awesome Film
",0.4404,-0.9702,2017-05-06 00:00:00,5,"Oh, dear! What happened here! This had the possibility to be a great film with depth... so what does Joss Whedon give the audience - a formulaic action film lacking in characterisation and an awful lot of changes to origin stories and ongoing characters, which didn't make sense. It felt so forced into being something big and spectacular that only helped in hindering my enjoyment of the film and story.Usually, I'd say that a movie is worth watching due to the story or the action but in this case, things don't seem to gel just right and the whole thing is messy and disjointed. This is definitely not the best in the Marvel Movie Universe... This is nearly on par with Iron Man 3 (another film which could have been awesome).I was having doubts in the opening action sequence as some of the CGI is sloppy, giving the scene an untidiness. You can easily tell which sections are CGI'd. Thank God things get tidier as the film progresses.Then there's Bruce Banner; a scientist with a clinical and logical mind who only wants to help people and would never hurt anyone... but suddenly is all too happy to let Stark activate an unknown AI though they know the dangers involved. This goes against the core nature of Banner but Whedon doesn't care. What would've been more in character would be Stark being his usual egotistical self and activating the AI on his own accord, only for Banner to find out and come in to keep an eye on things so nothing goes wrong, being too late to stop Stark It's such a little thing, but the devil's in the detailsWhen Ultron finally appears, nicely voiced by James Spader - though a little more creepiness and menace was needed (The ""I have no strings"" vocal is actually more menacing in the trailer than in the movie scene), you think okay here we go, but it's over too quickly and feels more like a damp squid than impending doom and throws the pace of. In fact, there's a lot of stops and starts in the pace of this film, I'm not sure if that was Whedon's intention but it doesn't work.Even the one-liner quips between the team were lacking in humour and feel thrown in to lighten the sequence and entertain. The trouble being if it feels thrown in it loses its power and the feeling of reality the filmmaker is trying to create. Once that happens then the viewer breaks away from the film and it's not as entertaining for them.Two-thirds of the way through I'd pretty much given up on the film but decided to stay for the ground shaking final fight scene. Which wasn't really too special as it was just loads of Ultron's minions fighting on his behalf (though he had previously stated that they were all him). The thing is if Ultron was such a Bad Ass and believed himself superior to humans and the Avengers then he should have taken them on one on one, as they were helping the stranded people to leave. Then when he does attack he lets his drones do it for him and you have an epic battle with epic music, which doesn't feel so epic, then it only takes four Avengers to dispatch Ultron in... less than a minute! What a baddie!... another damp squid.Hey, maybe that should have been the title - Avengers: Age Of The Damp Squid!As I said in the review for Guardians Of The Galaxy, Marvel are in serious danger of stereotyping themselves and following a specific formula, which is even more evident in this film than in that one. This could be the slippery slope to failure if they don't beware.If you've liked the previous films in the Marvel Movie Universe then you may be able to get through this one, though I wouldn't recommend watching it as a stand alone film since there are better offerings out there. If you're a fanboy of the comics then it's probably best to stay well clear of this film, especially if you don't appreciate new interpretations as this isn't a good one. This movie could be a turning point for fans."
" ""But if you step out that door, you are an Avenger""
",0.0,0.9995,2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Almost two years ago, when this was being released, I was the most excited Marvel fanboy you could imagine. The entire Marvel Cinematic Universe had grown on me immensely and had become a franchise that I went back to time and time again and this film was being released just as my inner nerd was evolving. The very first time I saw this I was disappointed, actually. It wasn't everything I had hoped it was, but I still enjoyed it very much. Then came the release of it's blu- ray and I picked it up day 1 to see if my thoughts had changed at all, and it turns out that I watched it three times in the same week and I just admired the film.After my realization that this wasn't going to be as good as The Avengers is where, I think, I truly found my love for this. Every time I saw it on I would sit down and watch it, or every time I was bored I popped it in and it just was so re-watchable to me. You see the thing that made the first one so amazing was the fact that it had been what Marvel Studios' was trying to do since the beginning and felt like a true experience. Avengers: Age of Ultron kept that experience like feel, but somewhere deep down it didn't feel as ""cinematic"" as the first.Returning to his rightful place, Joss Whedon once again sits in the directors chair for this outing and I actually think he did a better job here, in the direction aspect at least. In The Avengers, Whedon's writing ability is easily the best part; being able to have all these characters combine and he made all of them feel real. The writing in this, while fantastic, didn't have that charm of the first where it felt like a combining movie. He didn't have to set the chemistry up so I think that's why it's not as good. Anyways the direction though in Age of Ultron is better in my opinion.With grand landscapes and gorgeous set pieces gracing the screen, the MCU hasn't looked this beautiful in awhile. Each thin shown or even referenced has a purpose and makes the film even more compelling. The action is some of the best and I think it doesn't get the love it deserves, in the action department, because Mad Max: Fury Road was released the same year. The entire first sequence is done to perfection and the final battle is a marvelous piece of filmmaking. Each part is shot beautifully and the close, but effective, editing makes for the 141 minute runtime fly by.Like I said above, the way that Whedon wrote the Avengers themselves in the first one was phenomenally done. It's hard to balance all these characters and their individual arcs, but Whedon does it effectively and does it with such ease. Thanks to the actors though, they all combine to brings these characters to screen once again and I fanboy every time. Robert Downey Jr. being cocky as all hell, Chris Evans being a buff dude, Mark Ruffalo using a code green, and Jeremy Renner stealing the show from all of them with his jokes and inspiration, makes me smile and proves just how much I love these people. I always see complaints about Spader's Ultron, but to me he was perfect. He felt menacing, and the quick jokes just show how ""human"" he actually is.Even after my 6th! viewing Joss Whedon's superhero extravaganza of a sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron, has become quite possibly the most under loved, and under appreciated film within the entire MCU. My initial reaction to the film was poor, but after so many thoughts and talks I've had about the deep love I have for, not just the film itself, but the entire franchise and how it all fits together, has made me admire Joss Whedon's sequel and everything it does. From Hawkeyes kickass speech to Hulk vs. Hulkbuster, Avengers: Age of Ultron marks as one of the best superhero films ever and one that makes me want to throw a fist in the air."

",0.0,0.9438,2017-03-08 00:00:00,2,"The assembled Avengers cinematic universe, as well as each character's standalone film(s) is intended as an homage to a long standing property, fore fronting entertainment and nostalgia above substance and development. That is not detrimental by any means, some of the best products of entertainment have followed the same formula and found incredible and justified success. What Whedon has done with both of the assembled outings though did not qualify in this category at all. I am aware that he has achieved that untouchable-nerdy godlike status that allows him the ""creative"" liberties to now assemble juggernaut films like Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron, where the eye-candy mind-numbing loud-chaos inter-cut with snide comments, punchlines and one-liners aiming at posterity are force fed on audiences. Considering then that we're not expected to be watching a film with the narrative complexity that Nolan has granted Batman trilogy, we wouldn't have expected such thin, lazy and pedestrian treatment. The characters that previously were given little to no room to develop are now treated to clichéd and forced subplots, the setup and motivations are as tired and laughable as it goes and the required comedic relief is so forced and bland that it is widely cringing. Even so, Whedon somehow manages to go through the motions requiring an almost impossible sense of suspension of disbelief, even for comic book standards and plot holes you could walk an elephant through.All his might seem a contradictory coming from a self-proclaimed summer blockbuster superhero film fan. It might even seem more contradictory review coming from a huge X-Men, a fan that manages to somehow find redeeming qualities and saving graces in the weakest entries (and there are nine of them). The case with The Avengers franchise though is that an already overcrowded ensemble unites for sequels upon sequels, not to mention their own parallel trilogies that also include mini reunions of sorts, with absolutely no originality or saving grace other than the massive wide spectacle of worldwide destruction. Call it cynicism, call it incoherence. I call it overgrowing exhaustion with this franchise."
" Downgrade from the original
",0.3182,-0.7849,2017-02-15 00:00:00,6,"The Avengers: Age of Ultron is the highly expected sequel to the cultural impactful classic of 2012's The Avengers. within Age of Ultron, you can feel the burden of all this heavy lifting threatening to crush writer-director Joss Whedon, who, by comparison, had it easy the first time out, in The Avengers. His task this time: Show the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to be working together as a team; drive a wedge between them through Stark's creation of a peacekeeping AI called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) that turns against them; develop a romance between Natasha and Banner; flesh out Hawkeye, the regular Joe and, to this point, the most under-developed member of the group; introduce new characters, such as the twins Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). This already can seem like a lot, where as the plot is somewhat sort of messy. It is still entertaining but when comparing Age of Ultron to the original, everything about the original has this film beat.Age of Ultron is a good watch but it's hard to ignore certain boring or forced scenes. As many have said, this film being disappointing only lifts up expectations for the next Avengers film in the franchise. And we all know, the hype level and expectations for the third film will be quite high.
=====
As a rewatch (05/05/18') Age of Ultron is a decent watch but at time overwhelming and parts of certain boring. With many uninteresting subplots, action is there but some parts remain not as great. Opinions and voting remain same after a year of second viwing."
" Somewhat disappointed
",-0.4228,0.5302,2017-02-13 00:00:00,5,"I'm a big fan of Marvel and have seen the other Avengers titles, and so I went into this one with certain expectations. They weren't met.As opposed to earlier installments, barely a few minutes seem to pass in AoU without one of the characters making what is supposed to be an amusing, throwaway remark/one-liner. There's nothing wrong with injecting a little levity into the proceedings, but in this case, I found it excessive, and detrimental both to the flow of action and to the characters and how you engage. Wisecracking is usually one character's responsibility, specifically to provide comic relief. When all the characters are doing it, it gets tired very quickly.I found the plot to be a bit messy, perhaps because I'm a comics purist, and the introduction and treatment of several new characters here is only tangentially related, if even that, to their actual origin stories as per the comics. With apologies to James Spader, I found the portrayal of Ultron in particular to be bordering on the ridiculous, and inappropriately ""human"", as in my imaginings, Ultron was always more of a Terminator-style killing machine with tyrannical tendencies, whereas we're presented here with more of a lovable but psychotic rogue with as much dangerous charm as he has nuts and bolts. The whole effort seems to be held together by an abundance of action, new characters, and cameos from previous characters (Samuel L. Jackson, or Idris Elba) to distract from the general lack of substance.All in all, it was 2+ hours that I don't totally regret spending, but would not see it again, or recommend it - unless it's just for the voyeuristic pleasure of seeing your favourite eye-candy protagonists in biker leathers and latex."
" Hooray! This movie will waste two hours and 22 minutes of your life.
",0.2003,0.6362,2017-02-10 00:00:00,1,"The Avengers are back! Hooray! And naturally with a $316M budget, we could come up with nothing less than this disaster. So, the plot is this simple: One of the Avengers create something that (of course) they thought would be used for good. But then (shocking) it turns out that the creation is pulling an ""I, Robot"" or ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and believes humans pretty much aren't capable of taking care of themselves or Earth. Now the Avengers must stop something that they themselves created (irony!)...with the help of two new friends who at first were helping the creation but then realized ""oh he wants to destroy humans"" so they switched sides mid-movie.I guess you get to see Robert Downey Jr. play himself so there is that since he does that so well. You also get to see Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson try to fake their way through an Eastern European accent--and fail miserably. The rest just kind of hang out, nothing spectacular acting-wise. There you have it! Another extremely expensive knock-off of movies past. Completely uninspired and not creative. Don't waste your time (or money, if you can't get it for free). The horrible one-liners are predictable just like the plot.Go, Hollywood!"
" Good sequel
",0.4404,-0.5502,2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"I seen the Avengers 2012 two years back on Christmas. The running time couldn't hold my attention and I was having short cat naps in the second half. I think I missed many of the crucial parts in the story. But Anyway somebody told me yesterday that in order to really enjoy these marvel movies, one has to watch every film in the order and sequence that they release. So if you haven't seen the 'captain America' movies, then you're out of luck. The Avengers return in this sequel that eventually lives up to expectations. That is if you manage to sit through it till the end. I couldn't help but feel that perhaps this was on a shorter budget compared to the first film. The picture colour filtering also looked different. This is not really an issue but it gives the impression that there was some cost cutting involved. The plot seemed more straightforward and less complex to it's predecessor. The team are back fighting the evil. This time its some robot named 'Ultron' He wants to destroy mankind and have his own world. The final extended battle is the highlight and Olsen and Johnson are the new added characters in addition. The relationship between Hulk and Johanasen provides an emotional core to the story. I anticipate the 'Avengers Infinity' when it releases."
" An Okay Sequel Containing Lots of Action and CGI
",0.2263,0.6804,2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"This movie essentially begins with the Avengers raiding a Hydra stronghold in Eastern Europe and in the process seizing a staff previously belonging to Thor's brother Loki. Naturally, ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) wants to take the scepter back to Asgard but he acquiesces for a few days to allow his Avenger teammate ""Tony Stark/Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) a couple of days to examine it a little further. Unfortunately, Tony Stark has no idea of what he has stumbled upon and accidentally unleashes a computerized being named ""Ultron"" (James Spader) who decides to help humanity evolve--by destroying it completely. To gain time and keep the Avengers occupied he creates an army of robots all controlled by his computer intelligence. Meanwhile, he subsequently acquires the metal used to make the shield for ""Captain America"" (Chris Evans) and forces a scientist named ""Dr. Helen Cho"" (Claudia Kim) to use her knowledge in synthetic tissue to create a new body for himself. Throw in the addition of several other superheroes and villains and the result is complete mayhem on earth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, from what I understand, this film made over $1.4 billion and ranks as one of the highest grossing films ever made. And with a profit margin like that additional sequels are already in the making. Be that as it may, however, I was not overly-impressed with this movie by any means. Although the CGI was top-notch I thought there were too many characters involved in too much action and too many sub-plots going to really amount to anything coherent. That being said, the fact that this film garnered so much money is certainly an achievement and nothing succeeds like success. But it was all a bit too much for me and I have rated it accordingly. Average."
