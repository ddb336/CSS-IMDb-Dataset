" just nice
",0.4215,0.9638,2021-03-27 00:00:00,7,"This is just a pretty feel good film. I think the effects are pretty good. The characters are really impressionable and charismatic, and the mild mannered british sense of humor is actually funny, with every other aspect just reinforcing this films fun nature."
" Dumb mindless fun.
",-0.4404,0.9669,2021-02-27 00:00:00,5,"The concept is so lame and stupid, but the execution is so adorable and quite cute. This film has fantastic CGI and some of the over the top moments are charming. So as stupid and unrealistic as this film was, it was quite a fun watch."
" 10/10 please look after this bear...
",0.3182,0.8685,2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,As someone who has fond memories of Paddington in my youth I was dubious. I found this movie to be fantastic! I absolutely love it and I am often the one asking the kids to put it on.
" Nearly perfect when a movie knows what it is
",0.5719,0.8763,2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,"A lovely message, a hilarious sense of humor, and shot really nicely I thought. I really love when a movie knows what it is and just runs with it. Maybe a little bit too much kid humor for an adult alone? But that's okay I'll roll with it."
" Paddington is the best film of 2014
",0.6369,0.9574,2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,The most greatest films I've ever seen and I have to say it is so hilarious and so heartwarming as well it's just an absolute great film I gave that movie five stars
" Colors of Comfort
",0.3612,0.9675,2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,"Paddington 2 was a movie which I was not supposed to like, I generally don't like animated movies, but this was different. This is an ideal movie to watch either with family in holidays, or to repair your broken spirits after a gruesome day. It is a beautifully cooked dish with a dough of kindness, with a tea-spoon full of comedy and a dash of adventure. You will laugh, cry and melt your hearts watching it. And who doesn't love watching a small bear living in London who can resurrects the dead inner child in us.
Movie uses a soothing pastel color palate staying away from dark, light and sharp neon, this provides you a level of comfort only paralleled by hugging a loved one. I personally, couldn't believe that this was not one from Wes Anderson.
P.S. Do not skip the credits, I repeat do not."
" Great movie.
",0.6249,0.9477,2020-11-26 00:00:00,10,I love this movie it is one of my many favorites. It is truly a delight to watch and a treat for the whole family.
" Such a sweet film
",0.4588,0.9631,2020-11-10 00:00:00,9,"Honestly one of my favourite films of all time. The affects for the animals are so pure and authentic, as Ben Whishaw nails the innocent, fluffy bear of endearing idiocy and moral soundness. The supporting cast are perfect to put the spotlight on Paddington, who comes into his own as an outsider in an alien world. The editing is some of the best I have ever seen. The only reason it hasn't got a ten is because I still do not understand how humans can be so accepting that a bear can speak!"
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9657,2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,"The cinematography is fantastic, the bright burnt colors, the beautiful representation of the UK, and most certainly the fantastic animation. The jokes land every time, the story is easy to understand and very much relatable to all audiences, you cannot get enough of Paddington. Anything other than a perfect score is false in the case of this movie. No problems here"
" Paddington aint got nothin on my boy Winnie the Pooh
",0.0,0.9828,2020-09-22 00:00:00,6,"The visual gags and slapstick jokes are funny and set design is vibrant in its various pastel colors. The characters are entertaining in their own uniquely silly ways and Ben Whishaw's voice acting is perfect. But it rarely rises above average family film afare. There's a cliched villain with a tacked on back story towards the end to help build tension but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Neither is the overall arc of any of the cast of characters we follow. The father learns to let loose a bit and welcome Paddington into the family. The mother falls in love with her new heroic and heartwarming husband all over again. The jaded teen becomes friends with the strange newcomer and lets her family into her personal life. It's all too familiar and nothing in the story elevates the material beyond unoriginality and surface level character development. It was sweet and fun, but I don't ever see the need to watch it again."
" Heartwarming and charming
",0.7845,0.9305,2020-09-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie exudes so much warmth, cuddliness and British charm, that you have to watch it to see what I mean. It instantly gets you to a ""safe-haven"", when reality gets a little too overwhelming! :) Paddington's character is handled brilliantly, he is not cute in a stereotypical, sugary way, he is cute becausd of how naive and pure he is - I think it was a wonderful idea to have an adult voice him instead of portraying him as a child. Few other movies give me such good feelings as this one does!"
" What a beautiful movie
",0.5994,0.862,2020-07-27 00:00:00,9,I loved the characters and the storyline. My favorite part of the movie was the set design and the use of primary colors throughout the movie. Very well done! Can't wait to watch Paddington 2 now.
" A great family movie
",0.6249,0.9849,2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"A really enjoyable family film. I think this movie is really fun for both children and adults. The acting, score and vfx are all well done. I really enjoyed the set design. I liked the wholesome message and innocent nature of Paddington. This film made London seem very vibrant which added to the pleasant atmosphere. I also really enjoyed all the jokes. I highly recommend this one."
" Live action animation
",0.0,-0.1013,2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.Paddington is a movie that blends the Paddington station bear with a live action cast. The movie follows an animated bear as he finds a new home after a catastrophe. Along the way, he encounters a family that takes him in until Paddington can find information about an explorer. Meanwhile a villainess wishes to capture Paddington.Paddington is an enjoyable movie. Although aimed at children, the movie can be enjoyed by adults. It touches themes such as abandonment and family. The movie starts by pulling at these themes to drive both audience involvement and Paddington's motivation. The movie is also quick to be light-hearted so as to not drive children away. One of the ways the movie does this is by Paddington's love of marmalade. Paddington, the Brown family, and the villainess are well-realized characters that have their own motivations of helping or hurting Paddington. Mr. Brown, the father of the house, becomes more endearing as the movie continues. Nicole Kidman as the taxidermist that wants to kidnap Paddingotn is incredibly charming in the role. When her motivation is revealed, the audience could understand her goal. Paddington is of course a well-likable character that is animated well.I highly recommend Paddington for being a great movie for any audience.I watched this movie on Amazon Prime and the video quality could be better. The video suffered from artifacts that appear randomly. There was some skipping, but none of this hurts the enjoy-ability of the movie.Grade: A"
" Somewhat enjoyable until I saw the wall full of mounted animal heads... and their full-sized bodies sticking out of the other side of the wall.
",0.3832,0.0,2020-06-16 00:00:00,1,What a gruesome nightmare for a children's movie. And the dialog that went along with it was shaming animal-rights activists. Imagine that.
" Sweet
",0.4588,0.8074,2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,This is what a family film should be like. The British have a more subtle style that is a relief compared to the more brash American style. The main character is sweet if bumbling. The overall film is engaging and Nicole Kidman makes for a compelling villain.
" Quite a nice trip around London.
",0.4754,0.9821,2020-05-02 00:00:00,6,"Another kinda silly but cute story about anthro bear. Full of bad jokes, but it's able to bear (you see what I did here :D). Bear name's Paddington And as i said earlier he's anthropomorphic animal with human speech and good british manners learned by his Uncle and Aunt who'd learned before by british explorer mr. Montgomery who used to taste in marmalade. Few years later our title hero arrives to London persuade by his aunt who lost husband in accident. Paddington is in UK now looking for new Home.I won't spoil you mid and end of that movie. It's really watchworthy movie about friendship, audacity and bravery including struggling to find a proper place to live and good people surround you. Not only for the youngest, adults also will find something they looking for.My review
Enjoyable adventure with decent plot and likeable characters. Recommend for whole family who've wanted 90mins of rarely seen adventure.

" Fantastic entertainment
",0.7506,-0.952,2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Strikes the right balance of humour, wit, heart and peril for everyone of all ages to enjoy.Not only does every joke land, there are many side-splitting moments that will have you hooting and slapping your thigh.The cgi is unparalleled, i.e. you don't even think about the fact it's cgi.The one weak link is Nicole Kidman, but it doesn't matter. She's pretty lacklustre, never really seeming menacing, more vacuous and pretty, exactly as she was in the antagonist role in The Golden Compass, and her poor performance really does stand out as bad among the fabulous work of everyone else."
" Paddington adds charming zest to its deliciously sweet marmalade.
",0.8658,0.9986,2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,"What defines a home? Is it the delightful warmth exuding from the lavished shelter we call our abode? Or is it the accumulated heirlooms and contents that decorate the spacious rooms and hallways? For Paddington, a stowaway friendly bear shipped from darkest Peru to London, a home is defined by its residents. The welcoming tree of generations. A family. Named after the eponymous railway terminus, Paddington is temporarily adopted by the eccentric Brown family, whom attempt to find him a permanent home. A risk analyst, an illustrator, two school students and a housekeeper. Initially sceptical, Mr. Brown attempts to rid of the anthropomorphic bear immediately, due to the heightened potential risks he could cause. But, soon after the realisation that the family needs Paddington just as much as Paddington needs them, it becomes abundantly clear that the definition of ""home"" is, well, each other. Suited, booted, and ready to tackle the sprawling urban city of London, whilst trying to avoid a psychopathic taxidermist whom wants to stuff Paddington for a Natural History Museum exhibit. Old red hat. Blue duffel coat. Battered suitcase. Emergency marmalade sandwich.King's adaptation of Bond's trademark character in British literature is a prime example of understanding the source material. Whilst treading familiar narrative beats one could find in any family-friendly flick, such as the melodramatic moment of reflection and the sudden realisation when the moral of the story is spelt out during the conclusion, does supply an element of predictability, it does so with confident panache.King equips his screenplay with an abundance of British charm. From consuming tea and biscuits at an antiques shop to learning the eloquent mannerisms of typical London folk. For those uninitiated with Britain, Paddington's perspective provides a multitude of quirks and complacencies the nation takes pride in. Those of us inhabiting this rather small island will watch the feature hard staring at Paddington and how he copes with our culture, offering two distinct viewpoints. Culminating them together is a sweet, endearing and warm story about acceptance. No matter how you act. No matter how you look (even if you are a bear, but that's alright!). Family will always be there. It's a moral that sprinkles plenty of sugary goodness to retain Bond's pleasantries found in his illustrated literature.The substantial amount of memorable characterisation leaking from Paddington's marmalade sandwiches is extraordinary. Maintaining a nostalgic charm to invite adults, whilst including several scenes of sheer stupidity to entertain younger audiences. Notably the bathroom scenario, the pickpocketer chase and the discovery of sticky sellotape, all enjoyably convey Paddington's clumsiness and unfamiliarity with human society. Bolstered by an incredibly charming voice from Whishaw whom brings the legendary bear to life. Outstanding pronunciation and appropriate pitches for every type of emotion. That, and the fur-bulous (couldn't help myself...) visual effects that shaped Paddington into a lifelike miniature bear. Bonneville, Hawkins, Walters, Broadbent and Kidman all embracing the family-friendliness excellently, offering fun performances all-round. Some notable directorial flairs from King, especially the dollhouse integration to ascertain the characters of the Brown family, retain the narrative buoyancy.Overall, Paddington is the equivalent of receiving a warm embrace from your grandparents, or snuggles from your domesticated pet. It emits a sensation of comfort, leaving you with a massive smile on your face. A brilliant adaptation that, whilst familiar, accurately captures the sweet tenderness of Paddington Bear and creates an enjoyable story along the way. More importantly though, can we make ""Marmalade Day"" a bank holiday or something?"
" Didn't know a kids' film could be this good!
",0.5672,0.9967,2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect this to be as good as it was, because, come on, it's Paddington. But, surprisingly, I really enjoyed this film. The CGI for the bears is incredible, and the way the fur moves so realistically is amazing. Although, for a kids' film, it's surprisingly dark. A taxidermist wanting to kill Paddington?! What were they thinking?! You don't have Tigger trying to eat Winnie-the-Pooh. The addition of a villain felt unneccessary, although Nicole Kidman's performance was pretty great. I was pleasantly surprised by Peter Capaldi's character. There's actually some inside jokes if you're a Doctor Who fan, at his expense. This isn't just some kids film. I really enjoyed it, more than I thought I would. Will it be nominated for an Oscar? Most likely not, but it is a fun film. The writing was great, the acting was great, the CGI was great. Everything about this film was great. I highly recommend it. Contrary to what I thought at first, it's not completely un-bear-able. The fact that it has 98% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes says a lot, especially considering the type of film it is.
Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
" Wonderful
",0.5719,0.796,2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,A very sweet adaption of the classic children's books by Michael Bond.This deserves all the hype it received as it is a well-made children's film that adults can enjoy/learn a lot from too.With a lot of heart and humour this is a perfect film to watch during these troubled times.
" Adorable Whimsical Story
",0.5423,0.9545,2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,The visual effects gave this movie such a whimsical quality. The situations Paddington gets himself into made me laugh out loud. Completely enjoyable movie for both kids and adults. Great cast with Bonneville and Kidman. A feel good fun flick.
" a very good family film

The film is irresistibly warm, thoroughly enjoyable although overly sweet at times. In my opinion the film is made for children and is tailored for thier minds and imagonations but I think adult audience will also be able to enjoy this."
" Family Film That Actually Captures Spirit of Literary Source
",0.1779,0.988,2020-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Sooo many ""children's"" movies today based on great books are boring, unimaginative and sloppy. Return of Mary Poppins (why???), Shrek, Polar Express, Jumanji, ad nauseum are pointless and stupid. Then along comes Paddington Witty, imaginative, energetic, emotionally satisfying. The acting is alive and genuine. Paddington is truly child-like. He can bearly contain his curiosity and enthusiasm for adventure and friendship. Most importantly it is all about home, family, love, and marmalade sandwich nirvana. Great film based on a great novel."
" Brilliant

The sets and costumes are quirky and excellently designed to compliment the great feel of this feel-good film, and the detail of everything is wonderfully considered, from the colouring to the scoring of the perfectly judged live street band. British brilliance."
" A Peruvian in London
",0.0,0.2075,2019-12-26 00:00:00,8,"The first Paddington novel was originally published in 1958, and despite the mobile phones and pc's the movie still has a decidedly retro feel to it (even down to the calypso music the buskers play). Although we occasionally see Mr Brown leaving for and returning from work, we never actually find out, for example, what he does for a living that enables him to live in such a spacious house in West London with a red telephone box at the end of the road.But it's about a talking bear, after all, and any grown-ups obliged to watch this with the kids will enjoy the cynical (and occasionally racy) humour; and it also boasts a foxy villainess in the form of Nicole Kidman in a blonde bob and leopard skin shoes..."
" Tripe

" Beautiful, Funny, Visually Stunning Film
",0.8555,0.9274,2019-12-04 00:00:00,8,A Heart Warming film with humorous moments that will make you laugh out loud. The Bear itself looks visually stunning and looks very realistic without looking out of place. Nicole Kidman fit her role perfectley and Hugh Bonneville was hilarious.
" Paddington is cute and funny
",0.7096,0.9877,2019-11-15 00:00:00,10,Paddington comes to London with his aunt Lucy after his home is destroyed by and earth quake. Aunt Lucy is to old to travel on so moves into an old bears home. Paddington is in hopes to find a new home and that is when he meets the Brown family. They take him in reluctant at 1st but grow to love him. Paddington does some funny stuff like cleans his ears with 2 tooth brushes and floods the bathroom and the bathtub sails out of the bathroom down the stairs. Paddinton even catches a crook who drops a wallet. The Brown kids love Paddington esp Johnathan Brown. At 1st Judy Brown don't like him but she does as the movie goes on. Mrs. Mary Brown is the mother to Judy and Johnathan and her husband is Henry Brown and Mrs. Bird lives with them too. Henry Brown thinks that Paddington she be brought to a place where he could find a home something like an orphanage but a little different. Paddington says he could live with the old explorer who had visited his aunt and uncle years and years ago he's the one that gave his uncle the hat Paddington wears today. Turns the explorer's daughter is evil and wants to stuff Paddington and put him in her museum and that's when Paddington learns how much the Brown's really do love him now when they save Paddington from the evil explorer's daughter and in the end the explorer's daughter has to do hours of community service. Paddington found his home and that was with the Brown's. Paddington is a movie that all ages could enjoy cuz young kids would love Paddington as much as adults or teens could.

The realistic CGI bear is just brilliant and adorable (for the kids), with a couple of adult jokes thrown in the mix. Some very funny comedy situations and all in all a cinematic smash hit for 2014. Out of a very strong cast, Nicole Kidman is the star of the show, with an edgy and suitably dark performance."

" an adaption from children's story but is made for all ages with its cheeky humor and family drama
",0.3919,0.9931,2019-09-03 00:00:00,9,"Paddington is an adaption from children's story but is made for all ages with its cheeky humor and family drama. The charm, politeness and likeability of the main character is undeniable, separating it on another class from similar family films. Paddington embraces its themes, humor and drama taking them up to a higher level while remaining grounded emotionally.The main attraction of Paddington lies in its characters. Paddington, voiced by Ben Wishaw, is a catalyst for good to the people around him. The story is about a cub who seeks home in a far away land. Coming from a distant place different from all people, an undercurrent of immigration and xenophobia is present, the former is more prominent while the latter is more subtle. Paddington seeks home promised to his family by an English geographer. Arriving in London, he follows tradition by wearing a tie that indicates he is a homeless child. Initially, people only pass by until the Brown family. The Browns are a dysfunctional middle class family with Henry as their patriarch. Taking Paddington to their home, he is given only a night to stay and find his true home. His quest to find home repairs the Brown and uplifts the communal spirit around his foster home. In particular, Paddington's optimism is felt through the growth of Henry and his family. Millicent, the daughter of the geographer, played by Nicole Kidman, is a good foil to Paddington who seeks to clear her family's name by displaying him in a museum. Realizing his presence has caused enough trouble for the Browns Paddington leaves their house searching for the English geographer Montgomery Clyde on his own. Millicent nearly captures Paddington upon realizing that Clyde is long dead. After a brief battle the Browns adopt Paddington as family, closing his quest in search for home.On a technical level Paul King evokes influence from Wes Anderson with quirky characters, beautiful art direction, score and a strong sense of matching colors. The CGI blends also blends seamlessly with the setting to the point of looking life-like. Paddington, in particular, never stood out as cartoonish.Paddington is one of the better feel-good movies in recent years.9/10"
" Much better than I expected
",0.4404,0.9691,2019-09-03 00:00:00,8,"A young, talking bear from Peru looks for a home in modern London. The film does a good job of updating the Paddington stories without losing their 1950's irony-free 'innocence'. Simply the fact that Paddington never once pumps his fist and says ""Yessss"" is deserving (IMO) of an extra ratings point. The movie plays around with chronology (it's hard to accept new-dad Henry Brown (Hugh Bonneville) as being a Triumph-riding hippie when his daughter must have been born around 2000) or Montgomery Clyde's (Tim Downie) sepia explorations of the Peru being in the 1970s (based on the age of his daughter)), but the film is a fantasy about a talking bear, so what harm is there in mashing timelines as long as the 'feel' of the stories isn't lost. The animation is very good and the non-CGI cast excellent. The film has a bit of a Wes Anderson look, which I liked, and, in the end I was pleasantly surprised: I expected to dislike 'Paddington' on many levels, but actually enjoyed the film thoroughly."

The Browns, who live in Windsor Gardens, decide to take the bear in their house, and name him Paddington. Paddington is a troublemaker, but thanks to him, the Browns become a true family. Finally, Paddington becomes a member of the family.
I like this movie. There are two reasons. First of all, the characters of this movie are almost good person (bear). Even if they do wrong, it is hard to hate them. Secondly, there are a lot of parody of another movie, for example ""Mission: Impossible"", ""Back to the Future"" and ""Mary Poppins"". I'm excited to find the parody scenes. In conclusion, this movie bases on children's literature ""A Bear Called Paddington"", so the ending is peaceful. Furthermore, the genre of this movie is comedy, so there are many scenes which are funny."

So I was expecting a childish and corny movie to the point of unbearable but what we actually got was a smart, delightful and genuinely funny family movie. This movie made me laugh a lot, its jokes are perfectly crafted and are genius. Its plot is a little basic but the story is not all thats on offer. The animation is breathtaking too, together with a solid mostly british cast. The script is so clever and his paws so clumsy that I can recommend this movie to absolutely anyone"
" Stuart Little, if made by Wes Anderson. Kinda.
",0.0,0.9794,2019-06-05 00:00:00,7,"Right off the bat, I really liked the film. It's a wonderful mixture of the cinematic sensibilities of Wes Anderson and the wholesomeness of Stuart Little.While a bit predictable, it's really enjoyable throughout the runtime. The beginning, like all films of this type, is really touching and engaging to watch as you see Paddington make his way through the hustle and bustle of modern-day London, which he'd imagined to be more 'welcoming'.
This is classic' fish out of water' scenario and plays out well.The cinematographer has done a BRILLIANT job here. The shots are all immaculately framed with some obvious Wes Anderson inspiration. There are many creative shots (like the doll house shots) which just go on to prove the amount of love and care which went into making this film.However, the characters, either intentionally or unintentionally, are kind of one-dimensional, especially the little girl character (I forgot the name, sorry!) who gets the lamest and most poorly-written character arc which isn't even satisfying and when you think aboutit, she only changes her mind about Paddington when she receives gratification from her classmates. Instead of retaining her identity and remaining weird, she chooses to be 'popular' and 'cool' only when she sees that others love Paddington.
She and her brother have minimal interactions with Paddington and there's not enough to justify the sudden change of heart. Thus, I didn't care about their relationship.Most people will argue that its a kids movie, it doesn't need character decelopment! And they'll be right but when a film is this good in almost every department, making the characters more well-rounded would have made it almost perfect.Overall, quite a well-made family film! Recommended. 7/10"

The filmmakers behind Paddington have nothing less than my respect and thanks, for this film is gold gifted to an audience who was unable to have asked for it in the first place.The film was surprising, to say the least. The amount of inspiration this film is mind-boggling, in the perfect execution of gags, in the tone and dignified manner in which the film carries itself, yet without the slightest hint of pride it remains, at its heart, about each of our hearts.The film joins an elite group of films who have endeavoured to discover and master filmmaking that speaks our heart's language in its purest form. The heart leaps for joy as you enjoy the film, and the conscious mind follows suit, in a manner so natural that you find your brain working harder than you would have expected, without a neuron breaking a sweat.Paddington was by all counts an excellent movie that successfully follows filmmakers like Pixar in showing us our own hearts, while refusing to sacrifice the wonderful British heritage that the film so beautifully retains in all its glory. The film feels like Wes Anderson on board Thomas the Train having dinner with John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter.A very beautiful film that makes one happy in a way that made me stop and wonder where and when such happiness disappeared from my life. The word ""happy"" seems to reappear in a dark, gloomy, confused world that seems to not have entirely realised that it had left in the first place."

" Close, but just shy of meeting the mark.
",-0.3612,0.9595,2019-02-09 00:00:00,6,"This movie has some very nice Wes Anderson-esque (I believe inspired) shots that were enjoyable to spot out. It opens with a relatively intriguing act one, and throughout the movie serves some wholesome laughable gags as well as moments of stress and worry for the main character.Despite this, I did find that the plot moved a long in a rather uninteresting way. There were notable moments of emotional connection when bad things befell Paddington, but overall the plot itself did not hold a strong continuous grasp of my attention. The beginning of this movie was in my view its strongest point.Furthermore, I think the acting and dialogue of the supporting human cast doesn't do the movie any favors. Particularly the child acting, which despite the guilt I feel in calling them out, did not meet the mark. In addition, the young characters are also actually a pretty good example of how the writing in this movie can come across a bit less thorough at times, here presenting some very uninspired and cliche child stereotypes.I believe the strongest portion of this movie is its style which very modestly approached the perfected visual stylings of Wes Anderson. Unfortunately, this noteworthy, yet not meddle-worthy homage, gets washed out by a less than captivating plot and poor theatrical performances.I would not recommend this movie as a stand alone film, but as I have heard good things about Paddington 2 and have yet to see the movie myself, I can't really advise either way in the context of pair. I plan to edit this review post viewing Paddington 2 with my conclusion."

",0.7458,0.9876,2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"19 January 2015. Welcome to the digital age. The use of digital animation is clearly apparent or not apparent in this case that sweeps the audience into an almost seamless fantasy tinged world of live action Britain. Nicole Kidman quite bravely portrays a consistently cold, serious villain that seems almost unnecessarily too cold a character and perhaps a technical blip with the changing of the guard. What makes this movie brilliant is the slightly underplayed stereotypical characters so that the zany edge is taken off and allows the audience to more readily identify with these characters as their own. Underlying this movie is a simple, but potent message about family and differences which make for a tender, emotional appeal. The is hilarious, funny, and charming. The inclusion of brief animated bits makes for a superlative tribute to old animation and keeping the movie fresh and alive. What this movie represents is an superior achievement of high quality of what computers, animation, and live actors can display. This is what true movie-making is all about. The movie finally is continues the progression of the technical and acting skills fusing animation and live performances such as Ghostbusters (1984), Jumanji (1985), Jack Frost (1998)."

From his uncle's earthquake death in Peru to his bathroom misadventures and 'worrying marmalade habit,' Paddington is just delightful and encompasses all emotions. The movie is family appropriate and family pleasing!"

" Bear necessity
",0.0,0.988,2018-12-23 00:00:00,7,"I always preferred Paddington to Garfield anyway. Mind you, if you'd told me they could extend Michael Bond's newspaper strip cartoon which I remember better as an animated five minute slot-filler into a 95 minute feature film, I wouldn't have believed you. Well, toast me in marmalade if they haven't achieved that with this very amusing and enjoyable combination live-action / CGI movie.I firstly enjoyed the mock-Pathe News scene-setting prologue, spoofing boy's own adventure tales introducing to the impish little bear later to be christened Paddington and his aunt and uncle seniors, until an unexpected natural disaster leads to the little bear crossing from darkest Peru to, as it happens, not especially enlightened modern-day London. Taken in, temporarily at least, by a reasonably dysfunctional family headed by reformed rocker turned over-protective dad Hugh Bonneville, it's not long before the marmalade-loving baby bovine is creating merry havoc in their home. Things get worse for them all when a mysterious baddie in the form of blonde-bobbed Nicola Kidman takes an unhealthy interest in Paddington's welfare.While the above plot-outline of itself suggests a fast-moving series of events, what enhances the film much more are the numerous jokes dropped in to the story more than frequently and especially the imaginative animation scenes which constantly impress, like the doll's house perspective of the Brown family home or the air-pocket messaging system at the National History Museum. There are sight gags, witty gags (I especially liked the bear-punning sequence) and running gags, some even cocking a snook at the franchise of Mrs Kidman's ex.The cast obviously have fun with the material and situations, besides Bonneville-Scott and Kidman, there are enjoyable turns by Julie Walters, Peter Capaldi and Sally Hawkins while the kids too happily avoid being either cute or irritating.No there's nothing grizzly on show here, just a big welcoming bear-hug of fun and laughter."

When this news breaks out, a nasty villain (Nicole Kidman) seeks to kidnap the bear for devious purposes.The film has charm with an enjoyable storyline for ""kids of all ages"". It also begins with an interesting observation: that modern England is much less friendly and more hurried than the England of the past (post-WW2).This theme stops short, unfortunately, while the movie falls into the expected chaotic slapstick. There are times the story feels too contrived such as the transformation of the family patriarch. Other films of this genre (from which it might be copying) have done better."

",-0.5719,0.9522,2018-12-17 00:00:00,1,"I really don't know how any adult in their right state of mind can think that this is a movie suitable for children or why they'd think there was a need to reshape the original, charming tale of Paddington into this high-paced, horror-infused cartoon-style drama containing an abundance of elements not at all found in the original work, and also with just a completely diametrically opposed ethos. Whereas the original story of Paddington is a slow-paced collection of stories and has a subtle charm and sense of humour, this movie takes out the big guns and has a grand and quintessentially horror-based plot underlying it right from the start in order to, feels like, cash in at the box office and avoid the 21st century producer's biggest fear: boredom. These are children - very small people - and they really don't need this to be entertained. The image of the-epitome-of-evil scientist Nicole Kidman running after Paddington, sweet bear and incarnation of innocence, in seemingly endless scenes of chasing through the grandiose settings of the Natural History Museum with the grotesque purpose of killing, stuffing and mounting the bear for display purposes. That big needle, infused with lethal chemicals... Paddington being kept captive seemingly unable to escape his destiny...it haunted my 8-year-old in nightmares following this, and I cannot quite forgive grown-ups who inflict wounds in sensitive souls in the name of entertainment and in order to make money."

I always thought 'Paddington' was this silly, slapstick comedy film with a ridiculous plot. I couldn't have been more wrong. Fair enough, the plot involving a family taking a bear home is not exactly ordinary story telling, let alone the fact that no-one seems to be surprised by the fact that it is indeed a bear and a talking bear at that. But maybe I enjoyed it more because a talking bear was apparently considered normal instead of the usual ""oh, you can talk"" crap.Yes, the film had a few slapstick moments, but in general this was really funny and Paddington is just the cutest, cuddliest and most adorable creature. There were even a few emotional moments and the film also has a much bigger underlying theme. Director Paul King did a styling job creating a film that is exquisitely photographed and has fantastic visuals. It is a funny, full-on adventure fantasy comedy film that delivers on every level.There are a few plot flaws and incidents that made me raise an eyebrow or two - especially in the final act - but I'll disregard these due to the film's huge entertainment value."

I have to admit that i'm too young to have grown up watching the little bear in my childhood, but what a brilliant idea to bring him back for the new generation to enjoy. Its a true little adventure children can enjoy though their television with innocent laughs for mums and dads.
Learning about Paddington, going on this journey with him invites everyone hearts. I'm just not 100% on the 'problem' in the film, I feel like I was more glued to the character and the family life than the scenario occurring in the film. However Nicole Kidman plays the part down to a tee, playing a baddy that can be watched my children, making them want Paddingtons safety without influencing a scared emotion.
A good watch, with or without children. This film doesn't take itself seriously, the animation is brilliant, which helps you really feel as if the family are living with a little Bear from Peru. I love the real sense of it being a heartwarming adventure with little laughs along the way, however they could have come up with a more gripping 'problem' for the intense climax."
" Quick Review
",0.0,0.988,2018-09-29 00:00:00,9,"Paddington is a surprisingly good Live-Action family comedy, the type that no-one seems to make anymore.It's like one of those 1980-1990 classic movies, which clearly targeted the younger ones, but - at the same time - they were interesting and well made and so everyone could enjoy it!The direction is very Anderson-ish and with pretty cute British vibes and the performances are great. From the children and the cameos (many from Harry Potter actors/actresses) to Nicole, Sally, Bonneville and the voice acting of whishaw are all mesmerisingly great!And all those are before we even take under consideration the whole ""immigration"" theme that is ""underneath"" the Picture...Totally recommended it for everyone!"
" 'This family needed that wee bear every bit as much as he needed you. There. Said my piece.'
",0.0,0.9869,2018-09-21 00:00:00,9,"Paul King wrote (with Hamish McColl) the screenplay based on Michael Bond's lovable character Paddington and also directs this warmly sentimental, entertaining film that carries as many observations and comments about human behavior as it does in making a little bear come to life in a very human manner.A young Peruvian bear lives with his uncle (Uncle Pastuzo - Michael Gambon - voice, and Aunt Lucy - Imelda Staunton - voice) and is discovered by an Explorer Montgomery Clyde (Tim Downie). The young marmalade loving bear (voice Ben Whishaw) has a passion for all things British, travels to London in search of a home. Finding himself lost and alone at Paddington Station, he begins to realize that city life is not all he had imagined - until he meets the kind Brown family (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and mad Julie Walters), who read the label around his neck ('Please look after this bear. Thank you.') and offer him a temporary haven. It looks as though his luck has changed until this rarest of bears catches the eye of a museum taxidermist (Nicole Kidman). But love and acceptance and familial needs rise to the point where this little wisp of a fairytale comes into bloom quite nicely.The actors are excellent and the CGI effects that create Paddington are superb. In all this is a film to see repeatedly whenever our frustrations with social faux pas becomes distasteful. Recommended."
" Perfectly silly and sweet
",0.8074,0.7579,2018-09-13 00:00:00,8,"I knew this was going to be a delight right from the opening ""archival footage"" when the narrating explorer mentions bringing along a ""modest timepiece"" and it's a grandfather clock being lugged through the jungle. This wonderful British silliness is found everywhere in the film, from the exaggerated villain to the outrageous slapstick to the quirky scene asides (see the orphanage bit). Beautifully animated and colourfully shot, with a predictable story that's heartwarming nonetheless."
" While not particularly inventive or original, Paddington is warm-hearted, funny, and well directed
",0.7624,0.99,2018-09-03 00:00:00,6,"While it falls for the same problems of simplicity and cliche that plague many family movies, Paddington has better technical aspects than almost any and is quick, easy fun. The plot was standard fare, and the characters similarly one-dimensional for the most part. Paddington was a better protagonist though, and the movie is at its best when hilariously showing Paddington trying to understand how to live in London and in a home. I don't quite know how nobody found it strange that the talking bear was walking around London, and as always things work out pretty easily and conveniently, no matter how serious the trouble seems. The film does hint at a valuable point of what a home is, but beyond that there isn't anything unique thematically. I would still say that overall, Paddington is one of the best family movies to watch because of the technical aspects. The way the film is edited (its use of music, the scene showing the orphanage, the escalator scene was especially great) was impressive, the performances were good, and the script was good. Very enjoyable and pleasant to watch."
" Simply delightful
",0.5859,0.9352,2018-09-02 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. There's a wonderful sense of fun and adventure in this movie. Wes Anderson style whimsy is on full display and makes it a joy to watch. Paddington is so charming and endearing, and the supporting characters are all rather good as well. The plot detours into formulaic territory near the end, but the film as a whole makes up for it with originality in many other areas."
" Sweet as marmalade
",0.4588,0.9819,2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"This is the best mid-budget cinematography I have seen in years. Erik Wilson truly out did himself. I found myself on at least 7 occasions, audibly marveling at a unique and brilliantly executed effect of his work. In addition, the color schemes were bright and vibrant, making characters and places stand out and be memorable. As for the story itself, it carried strong until the climax, which felt lacking. This is one small hiccup in an otherwise remarkable film. Sally Hawkins is charming as could be, only outdone by Paddington himself. This is only the second film I have seen Hawkins in, and I look forward to seeing her again. All in all, this movie is heart-warming to general audiences and awe-inspiring to movie connoisseurs."
" A delightful surprise
",0.7096,0.9857,2018-08-21 00:00:00,9,"Wow! This movie is everything a family movie should be! On the surface this looks like a movie about a funny bear causing trouble in a big city, but in reality it's a story about immigration, colonialism and finding your place in the world, and being an immigrant myself in London I can't help but relate. The Brown family dynamics reminded me the Parr family from The Incredibles, with a very British spin and no superpowers of course, and Mr Brown's journey from stern to playful father looks like a modern version of Mr Banks from Mary Poppins. There are many interesting visual ideas like symmetrical shots that wear their Wes Anderson's inspiration on their sleeve, or a doll's house that opens up and becomes the Brown's home. I also found myself laughing out loud in more than one moment, I can definitely recommend this gem!"

That said, still, I watched the movie out of curiosity. So, I hated stuff like the Chipmunks movies and most such new film interpretations with originally drawn characters. I didn't expect much. But... wow! I laughed so much and loved all the small details. The writing, the acting, the directing, editing and the CGI, etc... is just enormoulsy great! Everything is so much better than all this generic, stupid Hollywood stuff of today's times. And the movie seems to work even for people that usually never watch such a movie. I mean, I'm kind of a Jim Jarmusch, Wim Wenders, etc... guy. So... 10 stars for sure!"

From the cast, the script, the animation and everyone else involved with this project - this film (and the sequel to it) come together to create a flawless story for all ages.Both this and the sequel are closely related and both must have been made either at the same time or with each other in mind.Like Disney's 'Peter Pan', the story is mostly about the kids and the titular character... and both give a generous portion of the narrative to the characters of the parents. There are other parallels, too.The voice of Ben Whishaw as Paddington is perfect and it's eerily similar to the sound of a softer Terence Stamp. At times you'd swear these two must have been born in the same room!Hugh Bonneville is sublime as the harried father who takes parenthood very seriously, although not always in a direction his wife and kids approve of. (Lots of teens will relate to that!)Sally Hawkins is simply brilliant as the wife who hasn't quite left her decadent '60s' years behind her... and who delivers the shortest lines ('Oooh, laminated!' & 'Crikey!') with phenomenal execution.Lots of slapstick for the kids and plenty of Easter eggs for the bigger kids, too.If you're a fan of the 'Richard Curtis' school of pathos, comedy, and storytelling, you'll love this."

",0.0,0.9949,2018-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, Paddington really surprised me. The story is light hearted, very funny, and has some great lessens for children. The characters are all great and funny in their own way and the dialogue between the characters is good. The ending is heartwarming and hilarious.The acting is very good. Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, Nicole Kidman, and Tim Downie all perform well. Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon do some great voice over work. Ben Whishaw delivers the best performance as Paddington. His voice is so sweet and calming which gives his character a light and kindhearted feeling. The pacing is good but slows down towards the middle. The runtime is very short. The CGI is a little dated though.Pros: Light hearted and funny story, great acting, amazing voice acting by Ben Whishaw, Paddington as a character, a short runtime, and a great endingCons: Some slow pacing in the middle of the film and some outdated CGI
Overall Rating: 8.0P.S. I can't wait to see Paddington 2 after watching this film. Ms. Bird is hilarious and I hope she is in the second film."

" Bears are the better human beings
",0.4404,0.9955,2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Usually, I'm not a very nostalgic person and I'm certainly not a person who watches Dinsey films as an adult. However, Michael Bond's Paddington has always fascinated me since my early childhood. The idea of an innoent bear from darkest Peru integrating into British society has intrigued me much. The novels have a lot of creativity and soul as they offer beautiful life experiences and valuable morals. Since I have always loved animals, it wasn't a surprise that I was always rooting for the sympathetic young bear.In many cases, live-action or CGI animated movies fail to capture the essence of the novels they were inspired by. To my very positive surprise, this is an entirely different thing for this particular movie. The animated bear looks splendid and the actresses and actors around him do a very credible job, making us believe that the young bear is truly around them. Paddington doesn't look out of place in contemporary London and actively interacts with his diversified surroundings.The story is nicely crafted as well. It tells us the sad yet hopeful background story of the charming young bear in a concise way. We then explore how the bear finds a new home, new friends and new experiences in London. There are many humorous scenes that put a constant smile upon your face such as Paddington taking a bath in a very chaotic way. Despite creating so much chaos, the young bear changes people around him in a very positive way. On the other side, the movie also has a dramatic side as Paddington is trying to find out more about his origins and comes across a pitiless taxidermist who stuffs exotic animals. The mixture of light-hearted comedy, gripping drama and surprisingly humane life lessons from a young bear is absolutely splendid.As someone who isn't nostalgic, I was truly moved by this film and enjoyed it from start to finish. The makers of this movie have managed to recapture the magic of the novels and bring them onto screen. Paddington is a very rewarding experience for younger and older viewers. If you aren't familiar with Paddington at all, you have missed out on something and discovering this fascinating franchise will change your mind about children's literature. In times, when cinemas are flooded with gruesome Battle Royale copies, it's refreshing to go back to such a classic franchise with a pure message. Watching this movie will make you feel like an innocent child again. Bears are the better human beings."

" Enchanting and delightful

From the cast to the writing to the cinematography to the music, it just plain nailed family storytelling. At a certain point, I started wondering if Wes Anderson was a consultant: every detail was perfectly placed. Like I said, enchanting and delightful."

" Probably selling something.
",0.0,0.9751,2017-12-09 00:00:00,8,"Paddington begins by drawing attention to a set of old fashioned ideals on style, behaviour and propriety, and hopes that the current generation might learn a lesson or two. Disarmed of his rifle, explorer Montgomery Clyde finds that even in deeper, darkest Peru a bit of British hospitality doesn't go amiss, a cup of tea and a jar of delicious marmalade all that is needed to make lifelong friends. The opening scene is a whimsical delight harking back to the silent movie era, with a boxed-in frame, fuzzy faux black and white footage, and oodles of slapstick humour to start us off. And later, when Aunt Lucy farewells Paddington on his trip across the Pacific to find a new home in London, she fastens a tag with a simple plea that pays homage to not only Michael Bond's original children's novel, but also a time where the kindness and generosity of strangers shone through the darkness of the Blitz. Many have noted the film's allegorical association of Paddington's journey to the immigrant experience, and what's especially impressive is the ease in how the message of humanity and compassion is given universal appeal through the children's format of live action/animation blend. It pays close attention to how often these figures are marginalised and pushed aside upon arriving and trying to settle into the dominant culture, so much so that they become almost invisible. The film's usage of gentle magical realism is the best I have seen since that of Lars and the Real Girl, where a talking bear is treated as an unusual but not impossible occurrence, and as merely another strange creature washed up upon the shores of Thames here to steal local jobs (and clog drains with fur, throw buns at old ladies, throw picnics all night - the script poking fun at the slippery logic of anti- immigration rhetoric, with Kidman selling it with mock seriousness). See what Henry whispers to his family and how he ushers them quickly past the sight of the crestfallen Paddington, as if he was not a sentient, anthropomorphic animal, but something of a dirty foreign nuisance. It's not the bear aspect of his character that bothers the London residents, but the fact that he is an outsider. The script is witty enough that every time we think that we've gotten the film categorised and figured out (cliches abound initially: the strict, paper-pusher father who eventually warms to the chaotic intruder, and we all just know what will happen when Paddington visits the bathroom for the first time), it flips those expectations on their heads and has us giggling in another way. There's a double blow early; Paddington, voiced by the delicate Ben Whishaw, is all charm and manners upon arriving in London, until he's asked his name and roars indecipherably before chugging down from a teapot whilst scolding Henry for his rudeness. The most moving of these moments comes when the family gathers round to watch Clyde's old explorer footage from Peru, and a mesmerised Paddington reaches out to touch the jungle on the projector. You'd expect slapstick here, for his paw to go right through and poke a hole, or for him to stumble around and set the room on fire. Instead, he slips through seamlessly, and in a magical moment is transported right back to the colourful jungle where he was raised. By the end he's found something different but just as welcoming - a family and home to call his own."
" From Darkest Peru to Our Hearts: 'Paddington' 2014
",-0.4939,0.9986,2017-12-04 00:00:00,8,"'Paddington' was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. In a world that is increasingly accustomed to such acts of terror that dominate our world news and a general sense of despondency it provided a breath of fresh air for young and old alike. 'Paddington' serves as a reminder that if the world seems to forget its manners you shouldn't let it affect you but just give it Paddington's world-famous 'hard stare' by watching this film.The film begins by following the expedition of a British explorer, or geographer, into the darkest forests of Peru, seemingly a long time ago as this segment is shot in black and white. This explorer managed to find a very rare species of bear, who were docile instead of aggressive. Out of sheer gratitude, the explorer taught these bears the British language and manners, which they still treasured after he had left them to return back to his country. They also treasured the idea the explorer gave them of the city of London, as a city which treats nobody like a stranger. However, due to the circumstances in which this family finds itself, only the little one, 'Paddington' (who was not really named Paddington at this point) travels alone one day to try to find the explorer in London. All he has is the explorer's hat and name.I will not endeavour to write the summary for the whole film. It is easily found online. What I think is usually overlooked from any analysis or review of this film, however, is the role of the British explorer and the impact this has on everyone. If he didn't teach Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo all those things while in Peru, they would never have known about London and the story would have ended there. Besides, he could easily have captured these bears and brought them back and make a fortune considering how rare their species is (this is a storyline which is explored in this film). He managed to shape and improve the lives of so many just by staying true to his values and imparting the good aspects of his culture, even if that sometimes means leaving out the distasteful parts as well.The relationship between Paddington and his eventual adopters, the Brown family, is also inspiring. When they first meet Paddington in the train station next to a 'Lost & Found' (the 'Found' part of the shop's sign is initially broken), Mr Brown thinks he is just another salesman or con-artists with another one of such exaggerated stories like Paddington's. When I first saw the film I thought the film was trying to make a comment on immigration, and I believe there are enough details to argue so. But Paddington's innocence manages to convince Mrs Brown, and Mr Brown agrees to keep him in their home until they find other places for him to stay, just ""for one night only"". The Found part of the shop's sign lights up again, and this is the start of a beautiful story that will charm so many children's homes around the world. The director, Paul King, expertly manages to convey the emotions and detail that are to be found in a story such as this by carefully applying techniques such as these to the screen.The story itself is very charming. Much of the casting is exceptional, with some of the finest British actors being represented here, such as the brilliant Hugh Bonneville as Mr Brown and the inspiring Peter Capaldi as Mr Curry. Is it just me or is just Simon Farnaby absolutely hilarious in his role as Barry the security guard? He does make another appearance in Paddington 2, so someone else must have found him as charming as I did.There's a lot to say about 'Paddinton'. I do believe it deserves a spot among our beloved family-friendly classic films like 'Home Alone' and 'Matilda' as it does possess all the right ingredients, like a nice story, lovable characters and excellent exploration of certain themes like family and immigration. Paddington has managed to become a household name around the world. What a far cry from the labyrinthine forests of Darkest Peru!"
" Laugh out loud, warm, gripping it has it all
",0.6705,0.9925,2017-11-05 00:00:00,10,"We all loved it. The family including five year olds sat and watched this. From the start, with the exception of laughter, we were all mesmerised. The film is great to look at, with stunning locations and the Brown's house is absolutely beautiful. The humour is there for all ages. Loved Hugh B dressed as a char lady with his wonderful Welsh accent (recognised a couple of actors from Horrible Histories at the records office) . The scenes in the record office are hilarious with clever CGI. I remember shops giving change via those tubes and pods.I hope the reviewer (selffamily?) can manage to watch it again as it's a beautiful, feel good film. So there's a baddie in it? I'm sure Michael Bond wouldn't have objected. Cruella de Ville managed to scare me as a child and many more, as did The Child Catcher in Chitty, kids love this. I can't praise this film enough, or describe how I feel when watching it (warm and fuzzy?)"
" Awful

" Ridiculously Lovable Film.
",0.3818,0.9963,2017-10-24 00:00:00,9,"Paddington plays like a modern British fairytale, and boy does this film brim with gorgeous colours, great actors and some truly great and charming CG-animation bringing the world's favourite Maramalade-eating bear to the big screen.Paddington is 'jolly-good-stuff' that is as British as British family films and comedy gets: full of down to earth yet relatable and sometimes self-mockery. Paddington you could swear was at least partially funded or meddled by American hands, but that is not the case here. One of the UK's most famous literary icons gets transformed into a believable and modern animal that feels like he's in a story custom-made as creative yet cinema-referential; it has great charm and feelings reminiscent to the Harry Potter films in its giddiness, like The Jungle Book in the opening sequence, and the benefits of gorgeous London-based scenery that drives the story complimented by the occasional homage to the Mission Impossible movies.Paddington: I expected a kid's movie that would be enjoyable and harmless; it's charm may just about make those rough-gutted moviegoers out there real sick. Overall it's an absolute joy and feel-good movie where you can be absolutely sedated by its stress-free story and characters. It's happy cinema done right."
" Charming and whimsical, but disjointed and predictable.
",-0.1027,0.9904,2017-10-17 00:00:00,6,"The narrative is predictable and relatively one-note, with the piece feeling more like a series of independent skits wherein the eponymous CGI creation clumsily causes some cute chaos, but the piece is harmless family fun and is genuinely charming on more than one occasion, even if the actual comedy only manages to provide one or two chuckles considering most of it skews incredibly young or relies on bizarre innuendos that seem wholly out of place. It's actually rather easy to forgive the story's shortcomings, to be fair. It has an incredibly eclectic cast comprised of (mostly) British actors of all standings, turning the picture into a sort of 'spot the bit-part' game that's far more entertaining than it should be. The visual effects are also realistic enough to be believable while still being whimsical enough to be enjoyable. Ultimately, the picture doesn't take itself too seriously but also can't be taken particularly seriously either. That's not really an issue if you just want some passive entertainment, but it can't provide anything more than that. 6/10"

Finding himself lost and alone at Paddington Station, he begins to realize that city life is not all he had imagined - until he meets the kind Brown family, who read the label around his neck ('Please look after this bear. Thank you.') and offer him a temporary haven. It looks as though his luck has changed until this rarest of bears catches the eye of a museum taxidermist.Review:This movie has a special place in my heart. I had never heard of Paddington before I watched this film, but I can understand now why Paddington is such a treasure in England. What really won me over was how the story was so warm and loving. Although the main character was an animated talking bear named Paddington, I felt connected with his journey and didn't want it to end. It reminded me of the good in people and how fun life can be. This was a warm and heartfelt film from start to finish. The story was well written and the jokes spot on. I laughed harder than I expected and it's one that I could watch over and over again. Ben Whishaw as the voice of Paddington was truly perfect. I really enjoyed the innocence of the character and how he portrayed that through his voice. The animation was great, never distracting from the story. The other performance that stood out to me was Hugh Bonneville. I thought his role as the over-protective father – Mr. Brown – was superbly acted and his interaction with an animated character very impressive. Another element I liked was the soundtrack. A lot of the upbeat light- hearted tracks went well with the story. London Is The Place For Me, was an obvious fit which now reminds me solely of this movie, plus I found that it stuck in my head for a long time after. Along with the music the sets were memorable as well. From the wonderful antique shop run by Mr. Gruber (Jim Broadbent) to the home where the Brown's lived. I also thought the moments in which director Paul King spied in on the characters through the dollhouse was a creative and nice touch. It's really hard for me to go after this film for much considering how I fell in love with it, but it was not perfect. Nicole Kidman's character Millicent was a bit over-the-top and not what I considered the best fit for the story. Her acting wasn't the issue for me, but more the character herself. The wardrobe and intensity threw me off from the rest of the film, although I did like the antagonist as a taxidermist. Another odd point was the transformation of Mr. Brown near the end of the movie. I enjoyed seeing his character open up and change his way of thinking, but it seemed almost too drastic of a switch. I originally watched this film when it first released but I re-watched it now with my girlfriend who happens to be six months pregnant. We both enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. When I think about our son who will be joining us soon, this is one movie that I know I'm excited to eventually sit down and share with him. If you and your family are looking for a happy and fun movie to enjoy, go watch Paddington. It lifted my spirits and really left me inspired. Paddington 2 releases this year and I can't wait to revisit my favorite bear in London.FILM INFO: Genre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy Directed By: Paul King Written By: Paul King (Written By), Hannish McColl (Screen Story), Michael Bond (Original Author) Release: Jan 16, 2015 Runtime: 1h 35min Studio: StudioCanal"
" A good live action adaptation
",0.4404,0.9899,2017-09-08 00:00:00,8,"When his home in Darkest Peru is destroyed, a young bear travels to London in order to find a new home. He's helped by a couple with two kids, which share different opinions regarding the new troublemaker which ""landed"" in their home. Although helping him find a proper home, the Browns start to attach to the newcomer but his negligent way of life and an evil hunter from a local history museum tend to interfere in their relationship, for better or worse.We're presented with the amusing and entertaining adventures of this strange bear which comes to a big city in search of a new life, but ends up in a lot of trouble, more or less due to his actions. It's a movie which doesn't have an extraordinary plot, but it's enough to keep you interested while making you laugh with almost everything the cute bear does. By the way, the CGI is top notch, and together with the actors' performance, create a good movie for everybody to enjoy. As downsides, it tends to exaggerate in many scenes, while being very simplistic when speaking about the ""evil"" part which hunts Paddington.Still, it manages to create a very enjoyable atmosphere which makes this movie a very good watch, especially during winter holidays."
" Magical
",0.0,0.9988,2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,"One of the things I resent the most in modern children's film and stories and in modern animation is that they can be visually enthralling but have not magic, no soul or no charm. I also dislike the fact that too many fables and old-books stories are brought to the screen with no soul and respect for the original characters and stories. To my delight, this is not Paddington's case.Paddington is a brilliant exception to the dullness, soulless bunch of animated movies for kids out there. This is so mostly so because the original story is there, Paddington and the the Brown's family's souls and personalities are there, they feel modern and contemporary, but not too far removed from the original. Pablo Grillo's animation is fantastic per se, but there are many amazing animators out there; what sets this film animation apart is the magic infused into it, so we come to see Paddington as Paddington, not as a puppet, not as a CGI character, not as a fictional. Paddington feels real in this movie, as real as any of the actors.The ambiance of the film is whimsical, it mixes elements that are very modern but also capturing a bit of the old London where the original story is set. The film has a great tempo, is full of fancy and fun, innocence and naughtiness, havoc and tenderness, action and stillness, happiness and sadness, adventure, laughter and family love. The cast in this film is great, per se, but that not always guarantees a good movie in the end. However, all the actors are great and believable in this film. I especially liked Nicole Kidman in her evil sassy ruthless manipulative and sweet villain role. The music is also fantastic with plenty of Latin rhythms throughout the film. Paddington is Peruvian, after all.Paddington is not only a very sweet, fun an enjoyable film. It also has a great message about accepting those who are different and welcoming those who need of our care because have nowhere to go; two things that we should be reminded of in these troubled times when refugees are sometimes treated as an ""it"" not as Paddington. There should be more Brown families in the world. I was expecting another dumb movie for kids. To my delight, Paddington is a a tender fun-filled magical film that made me feel a kid again."
" Be or look like. A constant equilibrium.
",0.3612,0.994,2017-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Abundant in clichés: A family decided to adopt baby-robot, small alien or puppy on duty. A grumpy paterfamilias, a tender granny, a weirdo girl, who live the typical evolution of (Christmas) characters facing the bad-wicked-ready to anything-which is certainly scary to look at the face-bloodthirsty. And then there are blows, there are falls, materially impossible misfortunes, a goody guard who suffers a crush of love for a man bizarrely dressed as a woman, there is a band of music, the music of the band, there are grotesque machines, and thieves, and cops and blah, blah, blah. Although I am not English, and the British will forgive me if I am wrong, seems to me detected a certain familiar version of British humour in the story. A chain of gags, in fact, that may not be hilarious to everyone but what's the matter? It is very well produced. Its singular aesthetic gets an attractive indeterminacy of the age in which the story is set. Beautiful visual tricks and very well detailed photographic magnetism. Look at that sets! And what a beautiful portrait of the monumental London! Our hero, by the way, is adorable. But not in the way of too much adorable pets. This guy has manners; He has received a good education from his elders. A demonstration of how anyone with aplomb and education should be able to go anywhere. A little hymn to the cohabitation. ""... in London everyone is different but that means everyone is equal and blah blah blah"" Of course, my dear Paddington, and in New York and Paris and Barcelona. It is necessary to be optimistic. We are all potential foreigners. And it's the animals and the people who think like you that make it possible. Thanks for this movie."
