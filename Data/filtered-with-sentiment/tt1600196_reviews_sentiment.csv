" Good storytelling and a slow build suspense
",0.4404,-0.923,2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"The action and violence are subtle and Tom Hardy's characters heart rate looks to never go over 60 despite the wrongs that are perpetrated upon him. That heart rate still never escalates, even when he pulls off an epic defeat of those who wronged him and threatened his blossoming relationships. Check it out!"
" Definitely this movie is worth watching
",0.5574,0.9913,2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely brilliant! Strong acting, good storyline, and an amazing performance from Tom Hardy. I loved his character, and the film kept me in suspense, with really good twists!! I highly recommend watching. He really made the movie more praiseworthy. James gandolfini is brilliant. Definitely this movie is worth watching. It's a blast, loved it. It demands to be put in some strange limbo of crime drama purgatory. Which is not a slight or an indictment on the film. Its refreshing actually. You feel like your in on a secret."
" Gangster life without the glitz
",0.0,0.4993,2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"So we know from the start that a robbery is going to go down - we just don't know where or by who.This film is filled with interesting, yet not very bright characters who are preoccupied with how they feel the world should be rather than how it is.
Our lead man, Bob, is a simple, earthy kind of guy: a man of few words trying to do the right thing in a dangerous world.This film is mostly about the characters - don't expect a devious heist, the characters just aren't smart or ambitious enough for that.Having grounded characters makes the film feel very tense and realistic.
This movie looks a bit beige on paper but this is actually its strength - I got really invested in the characters and when they got scared so did I.
A great watch but don't expect much action."
" A shining Tom Hardy
",0.4019,0.8898,2021-02-28 00:00:00,7,"It's reminiscent of Scorsese, and all the gangster films. ""The Drop"" is not a classic Hollywood film. But an exciting gangster plot and a touching love story"
" Brooklyn underworld
",0.0,0.872,2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,"It is a crime drama devoid of action of any kind. It's more character driven. Director is to be applauded for giving a crime drama without usual dose of gun , bare knuckle fight scenes. Tom Hardy is the present day Charles Bronson. His rugged looks and eyes do the rest. Though I am a lover of aderline pumping action movies, I watched this movie fully because all the lead actors gave excellent performances. Animal lovers will give thumbs up for the film."
" Epic Mafia Movie
",0.0,0.6249,2021-01-14 00:00:00,10,Great flick. Watch it twice to pick up on all the nuances and innuendos.
" The Drop - Good movie
",0.2023,-0.4605,2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"We look into an neighbourhood were everyone tries to make a living.
The characters are broken and wounded.
Like the dog that Bob rescues.
And even if this dog (now just a puppy) is harmless it can be dangerous.
During the movie we learn more about the (silent) Bob...and we see that everyone can be dangerous.
This movie is not so much a thriller or a crime movie. It's more like a character study. And as such it is telling us the story at a slow pace.
It was interesting to watch it...so you should give it a try."
" One of the best thrillers I've seen
",0.6486,0.9933,2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,"I had watched this back in 2015 and I remember it being the last movie James Gandolfini starred in. I love James Gandolfini in everything I've seen him and I was also on a roll of great Tom Hardy movies, so I felt so excited to see this 5 years later to see if it ""aged"" well.I'm not going to reveal any spoilers, but I have to say - knowing how it all turns out, I found myself still being at the edge of my seat, mostly because of the incredible acting. The pacing of this movie is flawless, the dialogue is great and the characters have such depth, it honestly catches me off guard.It's also a beautiful movie. The camera work really compliments the intensity in a lot of the scenes.There are so many movies in the thriller genre considered ""classic"", but I can honestly say that this is one of the most suspenseful and chilling experiences I've had. I wouldn't say this is Tom Hardy's greatest role (mostly because I believe it is entirely too subjective), but I would say he's just as perfect and precise in it as he is in Legend, Lawless, Bronson...Schoenaerts is also incredible. And so is Rapace. And John Ortiz.Just watch the damn thing!"
" ""No one ever sees you coming, do they Bob?""
",-0.296,0.9164,2020-11-26 00:00:00,10,God damn it's a good movie. I started watching this film with zero expectations thinking it'll be your average crime thriller but boy was I wrong. The story is fabulous which hooks you up from the very beginning.Tom Hardy and late James Gandolfini are just class apart. It's a must watch movie for everyone I believe. Ps Rocco is just toooo cute <3
" Simply a good movie

" Great film....
",0.6249,0.3609,2020-11-17 00:00:00,8,Tom Hardy never ever disappoints. Alas the same bullying thug hump Gandolfini performance. Reality with nearly all actors that are praised but give the same performance over and over - they're not acting. The casting director knows this.
" Best movie of 2014
",0.6369,0.5187,2020-11-11 00:00:00,9,"This is what a true bad-ass is. Quiet and unassuming, until pushed. Tom Hardy played this role to perfection. I understand that some people won't get it since it is not non-stop action and violent aggression (ex, John Wick, which I loved), but the rating of 7.1 is sadly lacking. You want good writing, acting and realism. Check out ""The Drop""."
" Acting is great
",0.6249,0.9376,2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"A movie in which Hardy played perfectly. It's a tense film, although not in the thriller genre. It has a very realistic atmosphere. If another actor had played in place of Hardy, the result would not have been so good."
" Thriller that makes me miss Gandalfini
",-0.0516,0.705,2020-10-12 00:00:00,6,"This was a missed movie for me, I had no idea it existed. This is odd because the cast is top notch.This movie plays out as a slow burn thriller that is very simply shot and has a lot of hidden depths in the characters. However I can see why a lot of people wouldn't have rated it highly, since very little happens in the plot. Tom Hardy is pretty good and his character has a hidden past that is revealed in the final part of the movie.In the end I love the Gandalfini was in this movie and I was reminded how sad I was to find out he passed away so young. The female character was a very typical one dimensional abuse victim, but the ending was a nice way to wrap things up.6/10 watchable movie as a slow thriller with a minor twist at the end."
" Gangsters, Posers, and the Strong Silent Type
",0.5106,0.9854,2020-10-09 00:00:00,9,"A character study of several personalities, victimized woman, wanna be badass, real gangsters, and a quiet guy who tries to do right but will do what he has too. The quiet guy finds a beat up Pit Bull puppy in a trash can and adopts it and later, adopts the victimized woman who lives in the house near where he found the dog. The story revolves around ""the Drop"", the random Mafia owned bar where all the nights gambling receipts are left. It is a different bar every night. The kind man who cares for beaten women and dogs works in one of these bars when they are informed his bar is ""The Drop"" on Super Bowl Sunday. the kind man who cares about people expects nothing in return for his kindness and plays this type of person spot on. He is Tom Hardy in his finest work of his career in my opinion. Without giving away the plot, the last line in the movie is my favorite when a detective says, ""they never see you coming do they"" to Tom Hardy as he wipes a beer glass with a bar rag."
" Loved It, A Story Of Small Time Gangsters
",0.5994,0.9837,2020-10-01 00:00:00,7,"The DropI really enjoyed this movie, it had a simple linear plot but was raised way above its subject matter by the three central performances who were entirely convincing.Tom Hardy played a dysfunctional puppy perhaps somewhere on the autistic spectrum with bumbling deadpan delivery, just incredible and daring characterisation. Whist James Gandolfino played himself I loved it and the gangsters moll played by Noomi Rapace was just right.There was palpable chemistry between Tom and James, this was an acting match made in heaven.The cinematography was invisible and the director achieved a light touch with such talent."
" 16 Minutes Too Long
",0.0,0.9426,2020-08-27 00:00:00,6,"This could have been great. It should have run 1h30m instead of 1h46m. The 16 minutes they could have cut out was all of the moronic romance between Bob and Nadia and the dog. A little bit of that was OK, but it detracted from the story and dimmed that narrative. Bob was just a bit too stupid for my tastes. He was just a few points above Forest Gump. Less dog, better film.I loved all of the characters from the Chechen mobsters to the cop to Tony Soprano. I've read loads of Dennis Lehane which means that I really like his work. I really liked this movie for a lot of reasons. A lot of his light was in this story."
" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9113,2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,"A slow-burn with exquisitely building tension. Tom Hardy gives a fantastic performance as Bill, a simple, unassuming bartender who is neither as slow or harmless as he seems. The film never shows its hand as Gandolfini, also superb, and the other characters menacingly revolve around each other. This is great filmmaking."
" Solid but unexceptional movie that feels almost like a theater play
",0.7017,-0.0427,2020-07-19 00:00:00,6,"""The Drop"", seemingly inspired by 70's and 80's crime dramas, presents you with a quite basic plot which makes this film almost like a theater play or at the best like ordinary TV movie. Over-familiarity clings to ""The Drop"" too much. For those wanting a crime thriller, film may prove a little too detached from the action. At the same time, such fine performance, especially by Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini is enough to make this film to be satisfying, no mater that the romance (Noomi Rapace) is the least interesting part of the story. It could also be said that, the weakest factor of movie is also one of it's strongest - the casting. It's a simple tale that is initially overshadowed by the size of the presences involved. To conclude, ""The Drop"" is cliched crime drama that offers viewers nothing they haven't seen a thousand times before, except solid performances which also include Gandolifini last role (he died just a month after shooting had wrapped on this production). it's just a shame that the film itself isn't all that it could've been.Rating: 6+/7-"
" The Drop
",-0.2732,-0.9983,2020-06-24 00:00:00,4,"I kept missing this film on television a few times, I knew it was one of if not the final film that the star of The Sopranos starred in before his death from a heart attack, but I did manage to finally watch it and hoped it would be worth it. Basically, set in Brooklyn, New York, Bob Saginowsky (Tom Hardy) is a bartender at a neighbourhood bar. Marvin Stipler (James Gandolfini), the bar's former owner and Bob's cousin, after giving it up to the Chechen mafia years ago, operates it with Bob as a 'drop' for illegal takings. One night, after finding an abandoned pit bull puppy in a garbage can, he meets Nadia (Noomi Rapace), and leaves the dog in her care until he can decide what to do with it. When the bar is robbed by two masked gunmen, Marv is annoyed that Bob gives information to investigating Detective Torres (John Ortiz). Chechen thug Chovka (Michael Aronov) later threatens Marv and Bob and tells them that they must make up for the stolen money. It is revealed that the robbery was orchestrated by Fitz (James Frecheville), and a discussion between Marv and his sister, Dottie (The Handmaid's Tale's Ann Dowd), reveals that Marv needs to continue payments to help his father who is on life support. Bob decides to keep the dog and names him Rocco, and bonds with Nadia, who reveals that she was formerly suicidal following a past addiction to drugs. Whilst walking the dog, Bob is approached by Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts), who later appears at his house revealing he is the real owner of the dog, he wants him returned or will get the police involved. Later, Bob and Marv find a bag containing a severed arm along with the stolen money at the bar. Bob is unnerved when Deeds appears at the bar, revealing he is a friend of Nadia, but Marv informs him that Deeds may have murdered a man named Richie Whelan ten years ago. Nadia confesses to Bob that she and Deeds used to date, while he and Marv return the money to the Chechens, who tell them that the bar will be the drop site for the night of the Super Bowl. Marv tries to convince Fitz to rob the bar again on the night of the Super Bowl, but he kills him when he refuses to do so. Marv then recruits Deeds to rob the bar, who later confronts Bob demanding $10,000, threatening to harm the dog. Bob becomes suspicious of Marv when he calls claiming to being sick on the day of the Super Bowl. On Super Bowl night, taking the dog with him, Bob takes $10,000 hidden in his basement and hides it behind the bar counter, with a pistol. Deeds breaks into Nadia's home and forces her to go to the bar with him to watch the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Marv vars his car nearby, with the trunk lined with plastic, parked near the bar, watching various mobsters drop off money throughout the night. Eventually the bar clears except for Deeds and Nadia. Deeds refuses Bob's offer of $10,000 for Rocco, then threatens to kill Nadia if he does not open the safe. While they wait, Bob tells a story about killing a customer who had won a huge casino jackpot, taking the money to help Marv, and disposing od the body, and it is revealed the victim of Richie Whelan, who Deeds has always taken credit for killing. Bob then draws his gun and shoots Deeds in the neck and then in the face at point-blank range, terrifying Nadia. The Chechens dispose of Deeds' body and collect the money from the drop. Chovka indicates to Bob that he was aware of Marv's deceit. While Marv is shot to death in his car, Chovka provides Bob ownership of the bar as a reward for his loyalty. In his head, Bob feels remorse for the murder of Whelan and fears that his sins have cursed him to be forever lonely. Detective Torres visits Bob at the bar to offer condolences over Marv's death, which Bob assumes was a carjack gone wrong, while Torres believes he was executed. Torres asks Bob questions about Deeds and his impossible involvement in the death of Whelan, being in a psychiatric ward the night Whelan went missing. Torres then insinuates that Bob is responsible for both Deeds' and Whelan's disappearances. Later, Bob visits Nadia and hopes to reconcile, asking her if she wants to see him again. Nadia offers to take a walk with him and the dog, but Bob hears the door jingle and he smiles as the footsteps approach, it is unclear who it is or what was about to happen. Also starring Elizabeth Rodriguez as Detective Romsey. Hardy gives a reasonable performance as the buttoned-up loner, Rapace has some alright moments, but it is indeed Gandolfini in his last performance that is most memorable as the man doing the money laundering and dodgy deals. To be honest, I could not fully follow everything going on, apart from that the bar was where all the criminal stuff was happening, all the Eastern European gang stuff is a little complicated for me, and the pace was a bit uneven, overall a rather average crime drama. Okay!"
" One of my favourite films
",0.0,0.9501,2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,"I remember seeing the movie poster for this film and for some reason knew that it would be good. It's a slow burner, and when it finally ignites, it really does go bang.Excellent actors, all which suit their individual roles in a superb storyline which is gripping from the intro, as any excellent film should do.I've watched this film around 30-40 times, and each time is just as good as the previous. In all honesty, I don't think this film could be any better.10/10"
" Good movie

" Just pure acting.
",0.0,0.977,2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Tom hardy obviously steals the show but this is a cast of at the time the worlds most talented actors. James and Noomi at the top of their game, Noomi in the end bar scene is amazing, James sitting in the car waiting for the inevitable. You don't need words to act as proven here. The Chechens and the detective who knows everything all very subtle, understated but powerful. Just one of the most beautifully acted films I've ever seen. Slow, intense and draws you in. Hats off to all involved. You're not alone, you have friends......"
" Perhaps I missed something?
",-0.296,0.9896,2020-04-29 00:00:00,4,"It seems many will disagree, but I found 'The Drop' incredibly uninspiring.I don't look at ratings/reviews of films until after I watch them, to allow myself to form my own opinion. So you can imagine my surprise at seeing this rated fairly highly across many platforms. I respect that, but for me this is terrible.First of all, I must say this, I love Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini - two superb actors. That's where the good for this film ends. Neither Hardy or Gandolfini give their best here, though are not helped by the poor script and lacklustre premise.You can tell they were going for something smart, like that mechanic they use for the drops inside the bar - they show it once at the beginning, then a few times near the conclusion as if it's something mind-blowing.I realised at one point I was 1hr 15mins or so in and was shocked as nothing had happened. To me, this is the definition of a plodding storyline. They build and build without it leading to anything, even throwing in an entirely predictable love quarrel.Back to the onscreen people, Hardy's accent bothered me too. I'm not normally one to critique accents, I even like Don Cheadle's 'effort' in the 'Ocean's' trilogy for example. It felt so forced. The other cast members are entirely forgettable, also.I think the reason I'm so frustrated by this is the fact it has two great leads, with an initial plot that could be enthralling. Instead, it's an absolute snoozefest. Perhaps I missed something?"
" Take your pillow if you are watching at home
",0.0,-0.1084,2020-03-28 00:00:00,4,"One of the most boring movies of all time. No character development, no emotions, no thrills. I wonder why this is rated so highly by IMDB. Right from the beginning you anticipate that something is coming and even when the end credits start rolling it does not come. Highly disappointed."
" My High Rating Rests Mainly On The Level Of Acting On Screen.
",0.0,0.9422,2020-02-29 00:00:00,7,"Marco Beltrami's score was also a nice, gentle, unobtrusive touch. There's nothing bad that can be said about the performance of the three leads - Rapace, Hardy and Gandolfini. I was scratching my head throughout the movie to find out what part of Brooklyn the story was set in because I couldn't read any street signs, so I'm guessing Bensonhurst? Dyker Heights? Bay Ridge? Regardless, it was a nice thriller and worth seeing."
" Fine, atmospheric crime movie
",-0.4019,-0.9474,2020-02-08 00:00:00,8,"The movie tells a tale about a bar set in a tough neighbourhood, where respectable hard-working people meet and mingle with parasites, lunatics or criminals, often without realising it. Thanks to fine work with regard to sets, locations, costumes... it's a remarkably convincing and realistic environment that becomes a character in its own right. The story being told is gritty, violent and compelling, with a number of beautifully unexpected twists and turns.The acting too is exceptional, with many remarkable performances. My own compatriot Matthias Schoenaerts, for instance, does very well as a not-too-bright, not-too-sane bully who is as obnoxious and as persistent as a sewer rat.In its own way ""The Drop"" highlights the plight of dog breeds such as pitbulls, bulldogs, bull-and-terrier mixes, and so on. Dogs, when bred and raised with respect, are magnificent friends, but sadly not everyone is looking for a magnificent friend : there are people in this world who go out of their way in order to raise truly dangerous breeds or truly dangerous dogs. This results in harrowing cases of animal abuse ; this also results in gruesome attacks on innocent victims, which causes ever larger circles of fear, prejudice and paranoia. In the movie, our barman hero/anti-hero discovers a mistreated pitbull puppy thrown in with the garbage. It's a scene, sadly, that repeats itself over and over and over in all the cities of our ""civilised"" Western world..."

The story may be a tad slow to some but clocking in at less than 2hrs long it's well worth the watch. A slow burn that keeps you guessing till the end. Tom and James are good together even though Tom is hard to get behind at times. He plays an odd character but pulls it together in the end.

It fantastically encapsulates a criminal underworld that's so complex and yet believable. The threat is constant and overhangs the entire film making for a tense, looming atmosphere that also allows for some hyper-stylised action and an exceptional twist. The final outing for Gandolfini he delivers a masterclass and charming performance that's in a class with Ledger in the Dark Knight even adding to the film's quality.

But the reality is : I couldn't get my attention out of the movie, I was lost in it.It is a dark-crime movie, with a little cold-blooded touch, and a deep layered story, making it unique in its own way.. There are a few gore (but not really that gore) scenes which give you the tension and show how serious the problem can be, and the mystery is slowly revealed one by one, making me curious of what will happen next. The movie will force you to sit and watch it until the end.Warm and romantic touch also present in the movie. You can witness a soft and weak side of a usually-badass-character-Tom Hardy.The plot was slow-paced but I think that what makes the audiences able to feel the sentiment, making the movie perfect.Every movie has their own weaknesses, but I don't see one in The Drop, so 10/10."

Gandolfini, playing the once owner, who's been beaten down to a front for the Chechen mafia, gives a great performance, and plays his role with assuredness and believability. But it's Hardy, the quiet, simple living bartender who makes this film more than just another gangster movie. This film could have been shorter, but the last 20 minutes of this movie make it a classic. Money, gangsters, deceit and violence, the fodder for many mob films.This film though, it has something different, Hardy!A must watch. 9/10"

I guess I should watch it again to fully enjoy the revealing at the end in retrospect, but I'm not sure I can stand it: the first half/tree-quarters is slow, and filled with apparently unimportant things such as the dog. I think the script does not make a good job enough in the slow build-up to keep you on the edge of your seats. I mean the Usual Suspects (and The Drop is nowhere near it) is an enjoyable movie as a whole, not just in the final twist. On the other hand, I've read that there are several hints hidden in the plot, the acting and the cinematography (such as specific lighting), so I guess this is a second-watch movie. Overall, it's a pity because the moral/psychological theme is very interesting."

" This Does At Least Keep You Thinking That Something Is Going To Happen
",0.0,-0.9662,2018-09-12 00:00:00,2,"""The Drop"" very effectively manages to present a story that feels ominous and threatening. From start to finish, there's an atmosphere that says that something big is going to happen. That it could maintain this atmosphere for almost two hours is impressive - because the truth is that nothing particularly interesting happens here. It stars James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy as cousins who run a bar in Brooklyn. But the bar is actually owned by a Chechen mob boss, and gets used every now and then as a night deposit place for mob money. The bar - ironically enough - gets robbed, some money gets stolen and the Chechen bosses are none too pleased. And Marv (Gandolfini) lives with his sister. And Bob (Hardy) gets a girlfriend (Noomi Rapace) and a pit bull puppy (I don't know the name of the puppy who played the puppy.) And her ex-boyfriend (Matthias Schoenaerts) is none too happy about the relationship. And there's a cop (John Ortiz) who goes to church with Bob and wonders why he doesn't take Communion. It's all very muddled and bizarre - at least I thought it was. It stays ominous and threatening - and then it fizzles out, without much really happening and with no real closure to any of it. In that sense it reminded me a little bit of the last scene of ""The Sopranos."" And yeah. There it is. That's why you should watch this movie!This is James Gandolfini's last piece of work before his sudden and unexpected death. That's actually why I finally decided to watch it. As a huge fan of ""The Sopranos"" and his work on that show, I'm sorry that he didn't go out on a better note - at least in my opinion. His character (with at least a distant relationship to the mob) is a familiar one. Hardy's character was more interesting in some ways - Bob was kind, gentle and yet still involved (even if at a distance) with this violent criminal activity. But I wasn't taken with Hardy. Maybe it was deliberate, but his performance didn't have much power to it. He seemed flat. Maybe that's the way the character was meant to be played, but it didn't capture me. Rocco (the dog) was cute - and he survived the movie. I always worry about cute dogs in a movie like this. The dialogue showed little imagination. At times this seemed to have been written in such a simple fashion that it seemed as if it was geared toward children. But it did always (from start to finish) feel as if something was going to happen. It always had that ominous and threatening atmosphere. Maintaining that in such a drag of a movie couldn't have been easy. It picks up a point for that. But in general, it really is a dud of a movie. (2/10)"
" Dark character-driven crime drama with subtle noir elements

The noir elements apparent in the second act make the film flow seamlessly from the strong opening to the explosive conclusion. It gets a 10/10 from me because it so deftly combines strong character drama with elements from several crime-based subgenres. The lead actor is so good, and the characters really are fascinating."

Honestly I thought his character was mentally handicapped, but at no point was I led to believe that was the point. I loveee Noomi Rapace but I could not for the life of me figure out what the point of her character even was???? Why was she there? Why does she even matter? I don't mind a slow burn of a movie as long as it's reallyyyy going somewhere... this wasn't... at all. Gandolfini plays a complete idiot who decides to try and dupe these eastern european thugs bc???? he used to be the man and now he's not. Honestly when after I asked ""what is going on?"" then I said ""who cares""??? The cop....WHY WAS HE EVEN THERE????? what did that character really even contribute to the story? I was checking the time so often throughout this movie it was upsetting. It's an 1:46...felt like an eternity. weak weak weak script. oh god and the cinematography... good god.

This isn't just any Brooklyn bar, but a drop bar for Chechnya mobsters. Money made at night from drugs, gambling and prostitution get dropped off at a random bar, sometimes this bar. One night the bar gets robbed, which happened to be a drop night. This leads to a plot that twists and gets deep, with clues and a puppy thrown in. Swedish born Noomi Rapace seemed right at home with a Brooklyn accent.The film is a low action crime drama and a mystery that you didn't know was a mystery.Good performances to create drab characters. Not a film for those who like a lot of action with larger than life characters making instant catch phrases.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Okay. But failed to do what it meant to
",-0.6124,-0.9828,2018-06-28 00:00:00,6,"It's impossible to substantiate my issues with this movie without spoilers, because my main issue is with the plot.Cinematographically it's all well done.
The acting, i wasn't too enthousiastic about, but that also had to do with the casting combined with how the characters were drawn.
It's weird, but i can only conclude that this just wasn't a role for Tom Hardy.He's meant to come across as this simple, morally relatively good man, who is later reveiled as the toughest killer of them all. But the problem is, Tom Hardy already has this air of moral ambiguity, of psychological depth around him, however simple a man he wants to portray. 
This largely undermines the effect of the beforementioned plot twist. I could just discern that the makers of this movie were aiming for it, but because of the kind of actor Tom Hardy is, however good, it doesn't work.The other way around, the guy who was supposed to be the real baddy, who turned out to be kind of a loser, also didn't really work. Again because this was all dependent on the turnaround that was supposed to originate from Tom Hardy's character. 
Without the effect of this twist, the movie never surpasses the level of a mediocre, slow, and even kind of boring crime story.Also, because of the focus on this battle between the protagonist and his enemy, which again failed to come across, the maffia boss was even less intimidating than he would have been were he the main antagonist. Same goes for James Gandolfini's character. That character worked way better than Hardy's part, but i feel he should have been the focus of the story. His scheming is barely more than a plot device for Tom Hardy's intended reveal, but at least he was on the same path all throughout the movie, and the audience could relate to his motivations. 
But now that Hardy was the protagonist, and we are supposed to relate to him, how can the writers expect to hide the fact that he was not wat he was portrayed to be in the beginning of the movie?It would have been better if we would have followed cousin Merv more, seen things from his perspective, most of all his dayly dealings with Bob, and suddenly get confronted with the real Bob. So in short, the movie is well made, but it fails plotwise, and it pains me to say that Hardy was simply miscast."

At first, the story seems to be a hit, but it falls flat in the middle. The film takes too much time developing Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace. All in all, the film had promise but falls short in the middle. The ending is well done but it doesn't have a huge impact because of the tiresome storytelling endured through the middle.The acting is very good. Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace perform very well and James Gandolfini truly is one of the best gangster actors ever.The pacing is awful. The film is very slow in the middle and sometimes seems like a never-ending movie. The ending makes up for the slow pacing though. The runtime is also overlong.Pros: Interesting story, good acting, and a good beginning and end Cons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, the middle part of the film is very slow, and wasted potential when it comes to the storyOverall Rating: 6.0"

Drop by drop. I haven't found out yet.Two unlikely brothers (Gandolfini and Hardy) run a bar in New York that's a front for mob night cash deposits. It gets robbed. Meanwhile, Bob (Tom Hardy) finds an abandoned dog which he uses to court a girl (Stereotypical Female-Character), who may be involved in the robbery, or not. By this time, suspense is suspended.Tom Hardy seems to be trying to channel Travis Bickle, but his aerial isn't plugged in properly. He has no trouble out-puppying the pitbull terrier he adopts, but at times he seems to be on Ketamine or something. Petamine?The late James G. gets some funny lines, but you can't help thinking the poor man didn't look after himself at all. Which is not what you watch a film to feel."
" Definition of Bad Ass

Locke was a great film, and of course he's had his hands in the Batman movie and will also star in the Venom movie. He just has a bad ass quality to him, it may be his voice, I don't really know.The Drop is a bad ass movie. I love Boston crime dramas, they are just so cool and calculated. It's like it's own genre of movies, like Mystic River and The Departed, all revolving around crime. I would through in Manchester by the Sea as well. Take all those movies, add them up, subtract a little, and you get The Drop.Great Solid Fun!"

" A dragged-out low-key crime story
",-0.5423,-0.6761,2017-07-20 00:00:00,6,"THE DROP is another gritty and realistic American crime drama of the kind that are all the rage. It stars the underrated Tom Hardy as a bartender who gets drawn into a murky world when his business is done over and he becomes implicated in the crime. Somewhat bizarrely, much of the character work in the film relates to an abused dog that Hardy finds and rescues, so animal lovers will probably enjoy these scenes. Hardy stars along with Noomi Rapace and the late James Gandolfini, for whom this was his last role before his sudden death. As a slow-burner, THE DROP is well put together and shot, but I kept thinking the story was mere build-up to something bigger, and then it ends, leaving me a little disappointed by the simplicity of the plotting."
" ""No Animals Were Harmed In The Making Of This Production""
",-0.6486,-0.9564,2017-07-18 00:00:00,6,"which is more relevant here than in most films, and might even be considered a sub-text for it.Perhaps more telling, though, is that the screenplay was adapted by author, Dennis Lehane from one of his short stories; I can recall successful short-story adaptations, but from such as Borges, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, and Conrad; more often than not, when adaptations of less-feted authors, the plot tends to be stretched to breaking point, where the screenwriter has too many gaps to fill, too much screen-time to pad, and where the story might not have been all that, to begin with.I haven't read the source Lehane short story, so I can only judge what's on the screen, but two things have jumped out at me after viewing the film: one, the conflict between the story's title, 'Animal Rescue', which suggests warmth and compassion, and the film's title, 'The Drop', which the opening voice-over informs us refers to gangsters practices of using legitimate businesses as temporary storage for illicit funds. But yet I don't believe the short story title is entirely ironic, because so much of the film is devoted to revealing Tom Hardy's lead barman Bob character's care and attention for a brutalised and neglected dog. The conflict between those titles suggests more that Lehane was badly compromised between commercial film-making demands, and the intimacy of his short-story characterisation.The other problem I had is the long slow build up, and what it led up to: it's not quite 'deus ex machina' but I had difficulty reconciling the climax with the characterisations that had been slowly and tortuously developed, over 80+ preceding minutes. Which leads me back to the compromise question again.What I did like, though, was the interplay between Bob and the detective, with the detective using their common church-going familiarity to both try to extract information from Bob, and also to get his message across. There weren't enough such inspired ideas, though. I liked Matthias Schoenaerts controlled-scary performance, as legend-in- his-own-mind punk, Eric Deeds. John Ortiz' insidious quiet nagging, as the detective, is another supporting standout. Tom Hardy was just a tad too precious and calculated for me, although he may just have been the victim of too much low-key screen time. (In character motivations, I could make connections with Charles Bronson's similarly-implausible 'Mr. Majestyk') Not the best swansong for James Gandolfini, though - too much of Tony Soprano,albeit a latter-day tired and beaten-down Tony; I would have preferred him to go out on the movie-stealing high of 'Killing them Softly'. That film had all the mood and menace of this one, and then some. Tellingly, perhaps, it's adapted from a novel."
" A regular movie where the interpretations are the biggest positive surprise.
",0.6908,0.7333,2017-05-02 00:00:00,5,"This movie revolves around a bar where organized crime (apparently Russian mobsters) often collects illicit proceeds. But the bar is robbed and the crime money is stolen and Bob, one of the bar managers, has the task of getting the money back. At the same time, a subplot is developed involving this character, a Russian veterinarian named Nadia, a dog found in the trash and a dangerous bandit, Eric Deeds. The film blends two stories connected by the central character and the script still has a certain scent of gangster movie. However, it is not a particularly interesting story.What gives strength to this film is the strong cast and their positive interpretations. James Gandolfini gave life to Marv, a man embittered by the loss of his bar. The actor managed to give his character a powerful and psychologically rich personality. It was with this movie that he said goodbye to the big screen, dying shortly after. Tom Hardy is equally to be congratulated. His character is the most powerful and psychological of the film, since he spends all his time avoiding trouble but ends up showing his anger at the end. He seems like a pretty normal guy to some extent, and the actor does it all in a very convincing way. Matthias Schoenaerts is one of the biggest villains and gave life to a mobster who immediately makes us believe in being capable of the worst things. Naomi Rapace played well, but I was not particularly surprised.Everything else in this movie is average."
" Masterfully directed crime mystery
",-0.5423,-0.9534,2017-04-17 00:00:00,9,"Time will tell, but the Drop certainly has the makings of a crime film classic. Firstly there's the beautifully well-crafted script by the writer Dennis Lehane, this time set in Brooklyn of recent past instead of his beloved Boston. The setting is so believable you can breath it. The characters are all people of the hood just trying variously to cope with the times and circumstances. None of them a rocket scientist really, just everyday people. One of the main characters we never see, because he has gone missing probably dead years ago. Yet people keep talking about him and the viewer realizes that this past mystery may be the key to what's going on. Normally there would be a flashback somewhere to show what happened to the guy, but this film uses no such devices. There is a strong financial incentive to break the laws of the street, as the title the Drop suggests, but the Chechen mafia in power seems to know or find out everything and will deliver punishment to those who are stupid enough to think they can fool the mob. The dialogue is sparse. Slips of tongue can be and are dangerous. The characters communicate with hints and facial expressions. It is the viewer who has to connect the puzzle pieces Lehane keeps slowly handing out throughout the film. After all, none of the characters are exactly law-abiding so it's not obvious all the time which crime is the real mystery. The Belgian director Michaël R. Roskam appears to me as a master of getting subdued yet nuanced performances from his actors. One of which, Matthias Schoenaerts whom Roskam brought with him from Belgium, does a very threatening bad guy indeed. There are some more Europeans. Noomi Rapace from Sweden is great as the fragile and secretive beauty of the film. Tom Hardy has the enigmatic lead role for which he has been appropriately praised. He's so Brooklyn here that I completely forgot he's from England. James Gandolfini is great in his final role of the greediest barkeeper ever. There are many reminders of film noir and the Hitchcock way of surprising the audience time and again. The cinematography is very old school, no car chases or martial arts. Were there any aerial shots? - I don't think so! In this film, the atmosphere is so tight that such things would have been mere distractions. I do think this will be seen as a classic!"

Boy, could we have chosen a more boring movie.While the plot twists are not all bad, the script has the movie play out in a boring setting to begin with, and when the delivery and speed of it is so mindbogglingly droll it just becomes a pain to watch. Halfway in we asked ourselves if we should switch movie or fast-forward, but decided to sit it out. Now I wish we hadn't. Good acting on the most part couldn't save this movie, and not sure anything could. If you're an everyday moviegoer that likes some pace to your movies, beware that this might not be your cup of tea.

The film deals with money laundering and the underground life of a normal popular bar in Brooklyn. And the main protagonist is simple, he just ""tends the bar"", nothing more.The quality of the film lies in the fact that simple events and naive and everyday talk between characters create a tremendous turbulence in the way the neighborhood works. *Spoilers* A simple dog-lover and worker at the bar, Bob, tries to live as normally as possible. He works with his cousin Marv who is a bar owner. However, things have changed after the Chechen mob decided to use the bar for their illegal transactions. While Bob accepts the things as they are and lives within that hierarchy, Marv is desperate and angry because his role in the bar is minor. He just has to obey the orders by the mobsters. Since he cannot accept the situation, he unsuccessfully tries to trick the gangsters and steal their money.Bob's and Marv's roles are tremendously played. While Bob talks slowly, doesn't understand irony, seems to be not very smart, Marv is a boss-wanna-be. He gives advice, guides and bosses the ""weak"", unwillingly admitting that he is just a pawn figure in the criminal world. Near the end, we are aware the director has managed to ""trick"" us - there are many tiny plot twists based on our belief that the characters are one- dimensional and predictable.

It stars Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, Noomi Rapace and Matthias Schoenaerts. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Nicolas Karakatsanis.Brooklyn barman Bob Saginowski (Hardy) spies an opportunity for a better life - but only if he can escape family ties, the crime that surrounds him and a dark past It's arguably a tricky film to recommend with confidence given that it doesn't sit still in crime genre company. This is very much a character based story about a small handful of people affected by crime, where they are chained to events occurring by way of law breaking. Roskam is in no hurry what so ever to spin his picture's literary worth, very much favouring a slow burn - even low key - approach. He deftly develops atmosphere whilst simultaneously ensuring we the viewers are very much a part of the setting and situations - something Lehane does so brilliantly in his novels. By the time the pic plays its hand, what appeared at first to be needless complexities, are valid and close the piece down with some considerable success. 7.5/10"

At the time I had hardly heard a word about it and had no real love towards Hardy (Bronson hadn't made up for ""the worst star trek movie"") but stuck in a situation where it was that or nothing, I jumped in about 10 minutes deep in to it. The acting from everyone is almost perfect, even Noomi Rapace dropping and picking up her accent some how works. Tom Hardy's character is written and acted to give you an east coast every-man on the autism spectrum with a dark past, it sounds crazy but its prime, subtle. The story its self, a crime drama, spends a lot more time in drama then my usual picks but never risks loosing my attention. A small contained story, well written but simple, it picks strange things to be complex about. It has grown to be one of my favorites of the recent years. Nothing crazy just a movie movie, but if you haven't give it a try."
" Money changes hands all night long, it's just not the kind you can deposit in a bank.
",-0.4168,0.8528,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this, its a bit of a slow burn for a crime-drama, taking a while to unfold as we get to know our characters and what they're really up to. Tom Hardy is excellent, playing the unassuming but progressively layered Bob, who... as he states... ""just tends bar"" for his cousin Marv in Brooklyn. James Gandolfini (in his final role) as Marv gives a memorable performance. I found his character very sad.The two of them easily carry this film which isn't as innocent as it seems. Bob and Marv are working an illegal scheme funnelling cash to local gangsters through money drops. A bar the bosses choose at random each night to be the safe for an entire city as money is always changing hands, it's just not the kind you can deposit in a bank.Marv had previously gambled his bar away to the Chechen mobsters (bad guys) and is now trapped working for them, while still trying to prove he's a tough guy in the neighbourhood. As events unfold Bob befriends a girl with a nasty ex, falls in love with a dog, gets entwined in a police investigation digging into the neighbourhood's past and everyone gets caught in a robbery gone wrong.This is worth a watch for Tom Hardy, Gandolfini's last role and a clever story that's not reliant on shootouts or special effects people do however get run over, shot point blank, and there are bags of cash and body parts. 12/4/16"
" This is THE ""crime film"" to see from 2014
",-0.5423,0.9747,2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Powerful, understated performances by the three principle actors, and a convincing portrayal of a back street neighborhood that gets by mostly on the underground economy run by the crime bosses. The closest equivalent I can think of here is 2013's ""Killing Them Softly"", but Brad Pitt's portrayal of Cogan and the Runyon-esque feel of the plot and dialog make that movie considerably less grim than this gem. But you should see them both and make your own decisions as to which one is better or more effective. Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini really sell this one. And I don't automatically swoon at the thought of a Dennis Lehane film (his adaptation of his own ""Gone Baby Gone"" came across like a Lifetime Movie Special in spots) but he's done excellent work here. Highly recommended if you like this sort of thing."
