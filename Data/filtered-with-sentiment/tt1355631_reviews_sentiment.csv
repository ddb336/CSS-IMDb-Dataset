" Far too slow....boring.
",0.0,0.296,2021-04-09 00:00:00,5,Lasted about an hour simply because of Brian Cranston...but it just didn't have enough enough to hold my attention...when I looked and saw another hour to go.... I swiftly made a quick exit....
" A competent study of a shrewd investigator and some crooked bankers...
",0.3182,0.9613,2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,"OK, first things first - this can be, at times, an incredibly dull film to watch. It is most certainly not an action movie and the pace, at times glacial, does little to create any of the jeopardy required to make this a compelling movie. It simply isn't. What it is, though, is a carefully constructed characterisation of Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston), an undercover US Customs agent who, rather famously in the 1980s, was part of an international team that cottoned on to an immensely lucrative money laundering operation using the then huge BCCI as a means to move drug money around the world with seemingly childlike ease. His role in the investigation, perilous at times, saw him compromise his own safety, his marriage and the lives of those closest to him as he adopted a sinister alter-ego for whom there were little boundaries. Cranston plays the lead role very well indeed, his ability to switch between characters is presented to us with a rather worrying degree of aplomb that lends a great deal of credibility not just to his part, but to the way in which these glorified confidence tricksters succeeded for quite a while in moving billions of dollars around the globe, despite the regulators' best efforts. Though pretty devoid of actual action, it's doesn't skimp on the depiction of the more violent nature their tasks which, coupled with the degrees of ruthlessness displayed from both sides, adds to the plausible narrative of this film. The supporting cast is a bit more hit and miss: Amy Ryan and Diane Kruger deliver well; Art Malik, Benjamin Bratt and Jason Isaacs less so - and we have a couple of typically charismatic cameos from Olympia Dukakis as his Aunt Vicky who appears to know quite a bit about numbered Swiss bank accounts. It's got something of the documentary about it - and taken in that spirit, it works ok. More the product of a booth in Langley, as ""Jack Ryan"" might say...?"
" Superb acting, GREAT script, otherwise average
",0.873,0.9694,2021-02-13 00:00:00,7,"Bryan Cranston isn't just Walter White. He can play both sides of the table; the drug lord or the undercover cop busting the drug lord. He does both parts in this film, superbly, as do John Leguizamo and the lovely Diane Kruger. There are a few plot holes in this movie though that keep it from setting itself apart from others of its genre. Luckily, a great soundtrack, script, character depth and fantastic acting all around make the movie, otherwise, a great watch."
" Casting is hard.
",-0.1027,-0.6908,2021-01-17 00:00:00,4,"So when you miscast the leading couple, the rest is a foregone conclusion. Mr. Cranston seems to suffer through the proceedings, and as he leads, the others follow. It is as if he were pushed from start to finish, without being able to develop any pull at all. There is no scintillating chemistry between him and the young would-be flame, and their scenes carry the malodorous scent of Hollywood kabuki.
A movie for movieÂ´s sake? Just about so."
" Fantastic movie
",0.5574,0.8127,2021-01-14 00:00:00,8,Lots of comments that Robert Mauser was a DEA agent....NOT TRUE. He was a US customs officer special agent.This movie was excellent!!!!! It's a must see.
" Decent, Worth a Watch.
",0.2263,0.9863,2021-01-08 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this film, mainly because I like crime/gangster films that are based on true stories/events.This one was interesting, exploring an angle not as common in these types of films, the money laundering itself.Bryan Cranston was in good form much like his performances in Breaking Bad and the supporting cast also performed well. The variety of settings for this films made it enjoyable and as it was set in the 80's there was plenty of nostalgia there which is always good to see! It had an interesting mix of violent and more sophisticated scenes in it which for me made the film more varied and personally enjoyable.Unfortunately, there isn't a lot memorable from this films or any real stand out scenes. However what this film does offer is a well paced, enjoyable and interesting film from start to finish, which tells the story of this undercover operation all those years ago, and for that I would recommend."
" Full action until the very end
",0.0,0.9727,2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"This movie has almost everything. It is full of action and unexpected plot turns as to keep you captivated until the very end. You get to take a sneak peek into the world of drug trafficking and money laundering, and you will see both sides of that world - the glamorous side with the glory and an abundance of everything, as well as the dirty side where any person's life isn't worth that much in the end and blood will be easily shed. In this world, however, true friendship and loyalty also exist - all human beings are human beings in the end. True and kind of unexpected friendship can also sometimes cross many kinds of boundaries and can exist between people from different worlds."
" Cliches and more. Cliches
",0.0,0.63,2020-12-01 00:00:00,3,Half way through this bore the only thing that kept me awake was the hope that Cranston's character had his brains blown out Despicable! the only thing more obvious is if he had the briefcase handcuffed to his hand inspector gadget would be less obvious

" watchable, energetic and tense
",0.128,0.8687,2020-08-29 00:00:00,7,"All the plot-threads keep the viewer guessing. With the help Diane Kruger Mazur ingratiates himself perfectly into various homes and habits. Then there's Mazur's wife, bitter and bitter, the expendable Evelyn (British actress Juliet Aubrey, excellent). Director Brad Furman is obviously working in the long shadow of Martin Scorsese and the Breaking Bad team. Still, he's learned all the right lessons, especially when it comes to music. Them Two's Am I a Good Man and Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows chime thrillingly with the action. As solid entertainment goes, this is the business. The finale as well is very intense."
" Cranston is great!!
",0.6892,0.9299,2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Of course I've been a huge fan of Bryan Cranston since I used to watch ""Malcolm in the Middle"". Breaking bad came out and blew my mind. One of the best performances ever in a television show in my opinion. Cranston delivers here again in a great performance as he attempt to infiltrate the ranks of Escobars syndicate. Great film!"
" A riveting narco crime-drama!
",0.0,0.8254,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"The Infiltrator is a very captivating movie that's based on a true story. The performances by Bryan Cranston and Diane Kruger made the movie so much more enjoyable. If it wasn't for them, this movie wouldn't be as memorable.What I liked -
The movie will have your attention from the very first minute and does a great job of building the suspense throughout. The POV chosen for this film is a refreshing take considering the plethora of drug related undercover movies. Diane Kruger's quick thinking in many scenes was delivered with aplomb and panache. The depiction of Bryan Cranston losing his real self and his marriage and getting too self-absorbed in the undercover alias of Bob Mysella is really good too!What I didn't like -
The production value as well the acting in this movie has been great. However, there isn't all that much happening in the movie. Sure, Bob Musella helps to bring some of the bad guys down, but there isn't that much of infiltrating happening which makes the movie lack a bit in terms of suspense and direction."
" Another triumph for Bryan Cranston.
",0.4767,0.8924,2020-06-05 00:00:00,9,"A pretty long movie that didn't drag and didn't seem long at all.Bryan Cranston was superb, as were all the other performers. Shots and editing were spot on.A completely different version to 'Narcos' and very worthwhile."
" Not a fan of based on a true story movies
",0.2115,0.9352,2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,"I just recently started reviewing movies on IMDB, and this is the first of many movies I will undoubtedly have the same issue with. These, supposedly, based on a true story or a biopic or something like that, where it gets the Hollywood treatment and over dramatize everything to make it more exciting. This is one of those. All it manages to do is take a really good story and make it a cliched mess where everything is forgettable and you roll your eyes as you know that almost nothing happened as it is portrayed. And what bugs me in these kind of movies is that the changes are not even necessary. In this movie, for example, (SPOILERS) all the arrests are done during a wedding, when in reality they happened the night before, where everyone was led to believe they were going to a big party that ended up being jail. They even went in limos! Wouldn't it be as engrossing as the way it is portrayed here? Why change it then? Nevertheless it is a good story and well acted by everyone involved."
" The 'Narcos' Wannabe
",0.0,0.1054,2020-03-10 00:00:00,5,"An alright-at-best crime drama that rode the coattails of the success of ""Narcos.""The Infiltrator has a deserving cast but the screenplay does the film no justice. Nothing differentiates this film from the many other films of the genre. In fact, this film tends to be more boring than most films within the genre.Some characters come off as unconvincing and get introduced too fast. So much is going on that people not paying attention will lose track. Some deaths are so over-the-top that it breaks the suspension of reality.Not to mention too many names and factual events were switched for dramatic purposes. These artistic liberties are so blatant at times that they were too close for comfort.I would give this a 3/5. But -.5 for habitual changing of factual events.2.5/5: Average & quickly forgettable. A bit more work on the screenplay would have gone a far, far way."

I've met her on the set of ""355"" film, she looks even better in reality than on screen, in film, the body shapes look bigger. She plays a cool role in this one too, as she only knows. Bryan Cranston is exceptional in the role of Robert Mazur. Also Juliet Aubrey as Evelyn Mazur, John Leguizamo as Emir Abreu, Benjamin Bratt as Roberto Alcaino, Elena Anaya as Gloria Alcaino, Yul Vazquez as Javier Ospina, etc. All the actors are good.

So many of these movies based on a true story end in the same way. they show a picture of the actor next to the real life person, and have text explaining what happened to them and where they are today. it has been done SOOOO many times. it is getting to the point where it's a cliche, and i'm just sick of it. they need to stop making so many movies based on a true story and start using creativity to come up with a good movie story"

Gain emotion to all the characters including the drug dealers.
In terms of it being a true crime story. For someone that knows a lot about Escobar and so on, it was a good and interesting story!Negatives: it's a bit long and certain scenes are a bit tedious. Also a lack of action."

" Outstanding...
",0.0,0.9964,2019-01-12 00:00:00,7,"""The Infiltrator"" is a Biography - Crime movie in which we watch a U.S. Customs Service special agent working undercover in order to cooperate with drug lords and clean their dirty money. After gaining a reputation he infiltrates the world's largest cartel, the MedellÃ­n cartel, and he has to do his best in order to expose the work of drug lord Pablo Escobar.I liked this movie very much because it is based on the life events of a real person and his actions. This movie has a very interesting plot which is combined very well with a lot of plot twists that you don't expect at all and makes it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Brad Furman is simply amazing with a lot of great scenes. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I had high expectations from Bryan Cranston who played as Robert Mazur and he didn't let me down not even for a second, he was simply outstanding at his role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were John Leguizamo's who played as Emir Abreu and he was also very good at his role, and Diane Kruger's who played as Kathy Ertz and she gave a different touch and beauty in this movie.Finally, I have to say that ""The Infiltrator"" is a great movie with an interesting plot, a very good direction and many great interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it, you will be surprised by its plot and you won't be let down by your choice of watching it."
" How many Pablo Escobar movie/shows have been made in the past 3 years?
",0.0,0.5927,2018-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Bryan Crankston stars as a U.S. Customs agent who uncovers a money laundering scheme that involves Pablo Escobar and the Cartel. Based on a true story, the movie starts off slow but gets suspenseful as it gets closer to the end. Crankston is great as he is in everything. John Leguizamo plays a shady agent who helps Crankston crack down the Cartel. Leguizamo seems to play the same type of character in every movie. The movie ends with a fake wedding and several cartel members getting killed or arrested. Tons of movies about Escobar being made lately and this one is better than most."
" Not bad, some good performances but quite flat
",0.0572,0.9921,2018-12-08 00:00:00,6,"'The Infiltrator' is a solid crime drama with some good acting performances, but it does also feel like something of a missed opportunity.The potential for a true story as interesting as this one was huge but it just never seems to get out of second gear. Much of the film feels flat and is remarkably low on tension for a story like this. There are some positives though and it is, overall, a relatively enjoyable film.Ordinarily I would probably be praising 'The Infiltrator', but given the material this film had at its disposal, it could have and really should have been a lot better. Credit however to Bryan Cranston who is excellent in the lead and at least makes the film watchable.'The Infiltrator' isn't a bad film, but the material deserved something much better."

That the story is true is mind-boggling. Difficult enough in our world to be one step ahead of the guy in front of you in traffic: imagine outrunning a billion dollar drug and banking cartel! Stellar performances all around. A real gem of a movie for a night when you just don't know what kind of thrill you will need, because you can find them all here."
" Breaking Pablo Escobar
",0.0,0.9426,2018-06-07 00:00:00,6,"'The Infiltrator' feels more like quality made for television movie rather than high quality cinematic piece. The story is straight forward and the outcome is predictable, the film is void of any sort of style, and there isn't much thrills or tension. That doesn't mean the film was bad, on the contrary - it was quite good. But that's it - quite good. Considering the source material, and talented cast (who all were superb) 'The Infiltrator' could have been much more. Besides Bryan Cranston's amazing performance as undercover agent Robert Mazur, there isn't much else memorable."
" Good, but doesn't stay in the memory
",0.2382,0.6613,2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Robert Mazer, a US customs official on the point of retirement, sees an opportunity for his undercover drugs operation to be given a revised initiative whereby they will pursue the laundering of drug money rather than the drugs themselves.Bryan Cranston stars as Mazer in this adaptation of Mazer's autobiographical book, which follows Mazer and a small group of fellow operatives into very dangerous territory as, under assumed identities as money launderers, they follow the trail of drug money back through the hierarchy of the Medellin cartel and its satellite organisations. The danger and the growing closeness with his fellow agent fictional fiancÃ©e threaten his marriage, a genuine affection grows with one of the drugs cartel and his wife, and an international bank is brought down.Bryan Cranston, as Mazer, is brilliant - why was this man not a star years ago? And the rest of the cast is solid, too, in a film which is essentially a suspense thriller - will they get found out before their infiltration exercise comes to fruition? The story told here is intricate: more intricate than it needs to be in a film which doesn't need the detail, much of which isn't greatly plot-relevant, in order to tell the story. You are left concentrating on intricacies which don't really matter: the real-life denseness, in which every detail mattered hugely, could have been simplified more than it has been, because the main plotline is actually relatively straightforward.And, because of this, and because it retells a real-life story, there are details thrown in which go nowhere. We expect the conventions of film to apply, so when a big thing is made of a gift of jewellery, we expect a major plot pay-off; instead we get a minor sidenote.This is quite a good movie and, I suspect, a pet project of Cranston (he and Mazer are co-credited as executive producers), but it didn't have, for me, the impact it felt as if it expected."
" Not 'vintage' Cranston, but not bad either
",0.5824,0.9768,2018-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Post 'Breaking Bad' I confess that I'll watch anything with Bryan Cranston in it. A few of his efforts since giving up the meth trade have been a little disappointing, but I was pleased to see that he was pretty much on form here in 'The Infiltrator.' Granted it's still not up to the dramatic standards of 'Breaking Bad,' but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not worth a watch.It's a true life tale (or as true as any Hollywood adaptation is these days) set in the early eighties where a drugs officer (Cranston) goes undercover in order to infiltrate the organised drugs trade of the day. Like I say, I don't know how many liberties have taken with the story, but it does seem to try and remain grounded in realism, not bothering with any major shoot-outs, punch-ups or car chases. So, if you're looking for some 'Bad Boys' style action epic, you're be sorely disappointed here.As Cranston slowly progresses deeper and deeper into the trade, don't expect the speed of the film to pick up much. As I mentioned, it's definitely not about action and focuses on how far he has to go and what he has to sacrifice in order to remain undercover (and therefore remain alive!). In short: it's a slow-burner.The supporting cast tends to be a load of people who you say, 'Oh, I've seen him in that film - you know the one I mean' and 'It's her out of that other TV show.' They're all functional enough, but Cranston has to carry it and without him it probably would never have been given a theatrical release in the first place. Even with my love of Cranston's work, I have to say I found the first half almost a little too slow and was debating whether I'd like it in the end. However, it does still pick up enough to all come together in the end and, if you're into a more 'thoughtful/realistic' take on a tale that most of us seasoned cinema-goers will have seen countless times, it's certainly worth a watch."
" Disappointing.....at best :(

" The Infiltrator showcases the dangerous and difficult career of an undercover agent.
",-0.6808,0.9942,2018-03-02 00:00:00,6,"This film details the true story of drug trafficking and laundering illegal money. Agent Robert Mazur invented a persona with a rich and lavish lifestyle in order to infiltrate Pablo Escobar's trafficking scene which was becoming apparent in 1986. Going deeper and deeper undercover in order to build a case that leads to indictments of more than 100 drug lords. Fascinating, ever so fascinating. What was really profound was the slow build up of trust and admiration between Mazur's cover up character and the drug lords of Colombia. The film portrayed them as normal people, genuine human beings with families. Sure what they were doing was completely illegal and something you shouldn't attempt at home...that something being an illegal drug trafficking scheme, but seeing that trust break at the end was actually melancholic. Captivating dual performances from both Cranston and Leguizamo, I thought they suited their roles incredibly well. Casting the beauty that is Diane Kruger is always great and I thought Benjamin Bratt's performance was noteworthy. The directing style was, on the whole, good. Nothing outstanding but towards the end wedding scene there were some nice long shots which I admired. There are a lot of characters in this story consisting of agents, family members, drug lords and corrupt bankers. It takes quite some time to establish them and get the story flowing, in fact I found the first half to be rather underwhelming. Nothing really engaged me. It's quite a meaty runtime (127 minutes) and honestly this could've been cut substantially. The second half was much better which included more tension and character investment. I also found that scenes just seemed to have been cut, one point we're in a hotel then all of sudden we're in France. Seemed to have been strung together to try and create flow but if anything it just hindered the narrative. However, some great performances and some interesting characters make for a good true story albeit unmemorable."

",0.6249,0.9311,2018-01-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie will leave you on the the edge of your seat from beginning to end. If you know anything about the beginning of the South American drug cartels, and their way of operating, or not, this will be a rewarding experience.
Cranston is, as usual, excellent in his role as a US Customs agent posing as a major money laundered to get the big fishes on the hook during the 80's blooming cocaine trade in Florida. As a former accountant, a family man with children, he soon realises he is in over his head, but raises to the task and do an excellent, but constantly life threatening job. Adapting to an increasingly brutal environment he does a great job, despite not getting really good support from his superior officers.
A movie based on true events, and one I wished actually were longer than it's 127 min running time. A must see."

",-0.2263,0.8126,2017-11-28 00:00:00,7,"A Great Cast does some Fine Acting that Drives this Fractured Movie. It is Split into a Schizophrenic Story that Struggles to Balance the Two Competing Milieus.The Emphasis Switches, not so Seamlessly, from Corrupt Shiny Bankers to Psychopathic Drug Cartels. There is Evil being done with Paperwork and Wetwork and as the Film Unfolds these Things Blur, Disorient, and make the Viewing Experience Less than the Entertainment is should be.However, taking Each Element on its own, both sides of the Issue, (""The Sting""), are Engrossing Enough to Withstand the Ping-Ponging of the Story-Line. It's Bryan Cranston's Picture Portraying ""Real Life"" Undercover Agent Robert Mazzulo and Cranston's Angst Anchors the Movie as the Deceits and Deceptions Determine the Outcome of each Phase of the Case.It's a Good Looking Film with a Soundtrack that doesn't quite Nail the Songs of the Era but it's Not Too Distracting, because the rest of the Production Design is Snappy with its 1980's Template.The Banker/Gangster Expositions Collide now and then with Tonal Shifts and are Awkward, but Overall the Movie is Worth a Watch for some Good Acting and a Supply of Suspense."
" DEA Agent Character Study
",0.0,0.6956,2017-11-01 00:00:00,9,"(Flash Review)Is it possible for a DEA agent to honestly care for hardened and ruthless people? Cranston brilliantly portrays the difficulty of keeping the two worlds he lives within and his emotions apart. Based on true events, Cranston's character has gone undercover in an attempt to set up and pull off a massive money laundering scheme to lure in top level drug cartel offenders. Paced nicely, you see how the scheme builds and how deeper and intertwined Cranston gets with various players. The focus is more on the character relationships, crisp dialog and slow burn tension, rather than elaborate action scenes. The soundtrack is less subtle but hit the right vibe and worked for me. Overall, this was a slightly unique approach to a genre with a slew entries, many of which are legendary."
" Great acting, but just a bit flat in places
",0.3716,0.6876,2017-10-05 00:00:00,7,"I really wanted to give this movie a better rating. It had everything you could want in a procedural drama, even if it wasn't based on a true story. Like every true story I talk about, there is no idea how much of the story is true or not, but it this one is enjoyable.The acting was spot on in this movie. Bryan Cranston shined as he always does. John Leguizamo was as good as he's ever been. You can never go wrong with Diane Kruger. The one complaint I do have is that Benjamin Bratt played a character he seems to be getting stuck with in this point of his career. The man is a versatile actor, stop putting him in drug dealer roles. Give him some space to shine.You probably already know the story even if you haven't seen or heard of the movie. A man in the government decides he's going to go undercover to infiltrate a cartel. It's not like that type of movie hasn't been done before this incident happened in the mid 1980's or after. Or we have seen it on screen. At least with this one they kept it grounded. Robert Mazur didn't go native or anything. He tried to keep his business and his personnel life different.One thing I did love about the movie was a subtle grittiness they put in the filming. It seemed everything was hazy when they were filming, and it worked for the time period they were working off of. The 80's were gritty and hazy. Depicting that in the movie was a brilliant idea. I wish other movies from periods would do such a thing.Now, for the thing that hurt the movie for me. There were a bunch of little factors involved. Things you would notice if you were paying attention. The one that stood out was that there was no crescendo involved throughout the entire movie. There was no build up to a big event. It all felt extremely flat the entire time.If it wasn't for the acting I probably would have given this movie a lower rating, truthfully. And the acting alone should be enough to watch this movie.Rating: 7 out of 10That's it for me folks."
" It's a Metaphor
",0.0,-0.9485,2017-09-24 00:00:00,8,"This is based on a true story and book of Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) working as a DEA undercover agent out of Tampa. Mazur gets the idea to ""follow the money"" instead of the drugs. The film is nearly 2 hours of him meeting and chatting with bankers and various members of the Medellin Cartel in project C-Chase which also tied into CIA operations and the BCCI, a later scandal that was so complex, even when broken down and explained, Congress couldn't understand it.The film is a real life crime drama. It has some action just when things are starting to creep. Some killing, some blood, some close calls. No one jumping from roof top to roof top. No car chase scenes, one car crash scene. No one fighting with a bullet in them. Action is bland when compared to modern super cop films.Guide: F-word. Brief sex. No nudity."
" Meh.., done before and done better
",0.4404,0.9626,2017-09-23 00:00:00,5,"Don't misunderstand me, it's a solidly acted, directed and produced dramatisation of the events of the time as predictable as it all was. As I said, it's been done before and done better. There's many tales of this type and this is not the worst but is far from the best. And I think that the combined acting chops of Brian Cranston, Diane Kruger, Juliet Aubrey and the irrepressible - John Leguizamo - are what brings this up past a 4-5/10. There were errors in the general styling of the characters, such as the colours and stylings of the nail polishes, the hair styles and even the shoes that Kruger's character wore at the faux wedding. Yeah, perhaps they're small quibbles. The soundtrack didn't save it and yet, I had high hopes when hearing a few riffs of 'Kiss Off' by 'The Violent Femmes' at the beginning. Time appropriate sure, although probably too alternative when trying to tie music to a scene. Remember, we're predominantly in Miami so the soundtrack should've reflected the cocaine fueled nightclub scenes, the general mid 80s vibe of Madonna, Wham!, Phil Collins, etc.,. Horrible yes, but appropriate, nevertheless. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that if you're into Cranston, by all means, watch it. If you want a nothing movie to kill 120 minutes of your life, then sure, it's like an extended episode of any cop show but oddly, not Miami Vice. Actually, if you want something worth watching in a similar vein then try 'Donnie Brasco' for a ""buddy was an undercover agent"" story. In 'The Infiltrator', no one seems all that bothered by anything or anyone. Yeah, they say they are and all that but it's all a bit contrived. Predictable, but by the end, I was kind-of hoping that everyone died."
" Lacked detail but worth a watch! 5/10
",0.3903,0.98,2017-08-22 00:00:00,5,"Review: The thing that made the Breaking Bad series so great, was the fact that Bryan Cranston was the most unlikely drug dealer you could ever find, which was why he wasn't the perfect choice for an undercover agent in this movie. He really seemed out of place throughout the whole film, and I was surprised that no one questioned who he was, and we're he came from. The fact that it was based on true events, makes me feel that the director missed out some key moments, because he seemed to join the cartel with ease, which made it feel unrealistic. Anyway, Bryan Cranston plays an undercover officer called Robert Mazur, who tries to takedown Pablo Escobar's operation, with fellow officers Emir Abreu (John Leguizamo) and Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger), who plays his pretend wife. As they have failed to get to the heads of the cartel from a drug angle, they decide to try a money angle, which seems to make Robert move up the ladder much quicker. He soon becomes friends with one of the big bosses, Roberto Alcaino (Benjamin Bratt), and he gains the trust of some top banks, which makes his operation seem believable. Once they have enough information, the secret agents gather at Roberts fake wedding to Kathy, to takedown all of the culprits they have been investigating but after spending so long in the drug world, Robert can't help feeling bad, whilst watching the people he has come close to, get taken down with nowhere to run. It's quite an interesting story, which must have been pretty scary to be in but I personally think that the movie could have been more intense, especially as Robert was surrounded by so many murderers. When an agent is undercover, I don't expect them to go home to there family every night, and I thought it would have been easy to work out that they were using names of dead people. Anyway, it's a decent movie which is worth a watch but there are better films in this genre. Watchable!Round-Up: Judging by the money that this movie made at the box office, it's obvious that Bryan Cranston, 61, hasn't got a certified, bankable name as of yet, and with movies like Godzilla and Trumbo not going down to well with the critics, it's going to take a massive hit for him to come out of this bad run of movies. He's definitely a unique actor, which is good at his craft but it's his choice of projects, which has to be questioned. Anyway, this movie was directed by Brad Furman, who has brought you the movies, The Take, The Lincoln Lawyer and Runner Runner. I think that this movie lacked the attention to detail which it needed, like in Blow starring Johnny Depp but John Leguizamo was great because he brought some wit to a difficult situation. On the plus side, it did make me look into Robert Mazur's true story but apart from that, it will be quickly forgotten. Budget: $47.5million Worldwide Gross: $18.3millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/crime/dramas, starring Bryan Cranston, Amy Ryan, John Leguizamo, Benjamin Bratt, Joseph Gilgun, Jason Isaacs and Diane Kruger. 5/10"
" Highly satisfying mob thriller you don't see so much of now
",0.6068,0.8349,2017-08-21 00:00:00,9,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning During the 1980s, the Medellin cartel funnelled a limitless supply of drugs through the port of Miami. Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) was an undercover agent, who assumed an identity as a mob member who conceived a clever plan for the criminals to move their ill gotten gains through the channels, and grew close to the top members of the Medellin hierarchy as he went along, but his position took an inevitable toll on his marriage to wife Evelyn (Juliet Aubrey) and placed his life in a constant state of danger.The limitless supply of true life crime stories from the archive of the 1980s flashes up once again with this expose of another crime scandal. Lead star Cranston appears to be one of the stars who found fame later in life, and made the biggest impression in the TV drama Breaking Bad, which I never caught. And so, this would seem to be the piece where I caught him for the first time, and he certainly has the presence to carry this role through. The film plays in a similar vein to 1997's Donnie Brasco, and those who enjoyed that film will be on pleasingly similar ground here.Director Brad Furman helms proceedings in a manner that will have become familiar to those who catch a great deal of present day crime thrillers, in a gritty, uncompromising manner, only by unflinchingly honing in on the predicament of Mazur's situation, rather than on any gratuitous blood letting scenes, in particular a harrowing scene in a restaurant where he's forced to make an example of a poor, innocent waiter to keep face in front of a mob pal. But it all builds up to a satisfying pay-off in the end, and you'll be glad you stuck with it.Aside from Cranston, there is a wonderful supporting cast, including the likes of John Leguizamo, Daniel Mays and Joseph Gilgun to keep the ship floating. Not that the juicy, shattering revelations of the 1980's crime scene won't be enough. ****"
" Watchable but hardly memorable
",0.0,0.0848,2017-08-11 00:00:00,6,"Bryan Cranston is ""The Infiltrator"" and it's Pablo Escobar's drugs cartel that he's infiltrating. Brad Furman's thriller takes some time to build up a head of steam but once it does, about two-thirds of the way in, it's pretty exciting. Cranston obviously got the part on the coat-tails of ""Breaking Bad"" but he's miscast here, (even in ""Breaking Bad"" he was never that convincing playing the tough guy), and it's left to the likes of John Leguizamo as his tough-talking, streetwise partner and Yul Vazquez's flamboyant, bisexual villain to carry the picture.There's a lot of plot to get through and even more characters, most of them hiding behind beards and all of them nasty. Where the film scores is in showing just how dangerous undercover work can be and there's a nice touch of black humour in the climax. It's said to be based on a true story and they do say that truth is stranger than fiction but this does seem rather far-fetched. It's certainly watchable but with a stronger script it might even have been memorable."
" The Infiltrator Has An Originality Problem
",-0.4019,0.9908,2017-07-22 00:00:00,6,"The Infiltrator is a familiar movie with familiar characters, a familiar plot, and familiar twists. While watching this movie, you may find yourself thinking, ""this is all fine, but it seems like something is missing."" That something is originality.The movie has a sizable originality problem. With each passing scene, you will notice previously used tropes from Donnie Brasco (the infiltrator empathizing with criminals while undercover) and The Departed (the infiltrator struggling to withstand the emotional burdens of the job), to name a few. Trust me, there are plenty more. This could work fine if the filmmakers infused the story with at least a few drops of their own special sauce, but this isn't the case.The lack of originality could have also been overcome if this movie managed to reach the quality levels of its predecessors (a tall task, for certain). To do this the movie required some intensity, some sequences that evoked raw emotional responses from viewers. This never happens. At no point are we led to feel that the infiltrator is any real danger.Additionally, the execution needed to be crisp and consistent. It wasn't. Instead it often felt disjointed. The scenes often lacked coherent transitions so we were left watching the infiltrator interacting with various groups of characters who have no clear connection to one another until the final few scenes. Even then there is no big payoff or surprise. It is, once again, unoriginal.Despite its flaws, the movie is certainly not a total miss. Bryan Cranston showcases his acting authority once again. His brightest displays account for the movie's strongest moments. One particular scene with Cranston and his wife at dinner will be remembered. (That clip is worth watching on Youtube, if you plan to skip the movie.) Still, Cranston could only do so much. Don't blame him for this one; I certainly do not. Though he admirably trudges along, at times appearing very aware of the movie's clichÃ©s, he can't completely mask the movie's stale flavor. What we are left with is something resembling leftover pizza from a great pizza place that has been microwaved the next day. It's fine. There's still something wonderful there. But it's unmistakably un-fresh. And it ultimately leaves you unsatisfied."
" Brutal reality of undercover work
",-0.6249,0.8422,2017-06-12 00:00:00,9,"Some things can feel like a drag. Like being an investigative undercover cop. You don't have much private life and you can't have too many friends. Well outside of the fake friendships you may create to get what you want. And while this does not hit you with a hammer over your head, there are subtle hints and some obvious ones in the portrayal Bryan Cranston gives us.There are quite a few good actors in this and all is based on real persons and a real case. It really is difficult to capture all this and go into all the private moments. Even with two hours running time, there is certain things that have to be left out. But it still is very coherent and very suspenseful, from start to finish. It's not quite Infernal Affairs, but then again what movie is? This is powerful and while the most of the characters are despicable, they are also human beings and the struggle and transformation feels real.Having said that, I do understand if for some this is not enough, one criticism I didn't get is about the music. Soundtrack by the numbers? What is that supposed to be? You can dislike the movie obviously taste-wise, but I would seriously like to know what another reviewer meant by this."
" A decent but lazy effort by Furman!
",-0.5487,0.9975,2017-05-20 00:00:00,5,"The Infiltrator is a terrific story that ends up only being a decent little picture because filmmaker Brad Furman drops the ball in some key areas. First off, the opening 45 minutes feel like every single drug/undercover/gangster picture you've ever seen all rolled up into one. If I told you the filmmakers chose to use the Curtis Mayfield song Pusherman, would I have to say anymore? Wow guys, really? Along those lines, this film takes place smack dab in the middle of the 80's but feels like a rehash of every 70's drug film. If one just looks at the 80's as some cheesy period, then it will be so... If one looks at it as a lively time w/ new music- 2nd British invasion, new design, some cool fashion aspects (and some cheesy) and some continued sexual experimentation. (The bi-sexual adviser to Escabor fit right in the times, too bad they kind of squandered the chance to do more w/ him.) Look no further than here for a great primer on the time period: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GG0MR5E#_swftext_Swf At bare minimum, the musical cues were awful, nothing even remotely 80's like at all. Eminence Front by The Who, that's your 80's tune? A classic rock icon of the 60's and 70's and from a record in 1982. A great Rush tune, Tom Sawyer, 1981, opens the film and sets the tempo for a nice scene. It would be okay to open w this but to bookend end w/ another classic rocker indicates the filmmakers had no regard or feel for the period. Try Depeche Mode, Yaz, PiL, hell Bauhaus or Love & Rockets for something edgier. Try something that at least evokes the period... There are a ton of mis steps just like it. For instance, Mom's are great, I bet Brad's Mom is especially awesome. But, letting her write the script? She may be apt to miss things like Wiseguys don't do facial hair (which was more a 70's than 80's thing.) The Wiseguy bodyguard has a big bushy beard, the pic of the real guy at the end of the film clearly illustrates the point. Look no further than here for some Made Man elucidation: https://www.amazon.com/Real-CASINO-Special- Bonus/dp/B008PBCT0A/ In addition, there's a definite sense here that no one associated w/ this film knows anything... and I mean anything about blow. Like uggatz, tho I'm sure Ma Furman loved to dole out mounds of the Colombian marching powder in her day. I mean, there was absolutely no sense of Cocaine permeating this picture at all, none! Just watch how GoodFellas & Casino do it, as Marty clearly did more than dabble. It's egregiously negligent seeing that the film is all about taking down Coke Cartels! And trust me, more than a few of these fellas got high on their own supply, no doubt. Also, it's not as if Ma Furman brought any new, rad feminist sensibility to the pic, it's neutral on the bechdel test at best. It easily could have been so much more. I know Brad's a talented dude, his first films The Take & Lincoln Lawyer were very skillfully crafted, and demonstrated real chops. Even tho the performances were very strong in The Infiltrator, This feels frankly like a wasted, half assed, lazy effort. When folks wanna get it right, they do the work. Take a TV show like Halt & Catch Fire, they really studied to capture the feel of 80's Dallas to get the details right, even renting the aforementioned doc, Warriors of the Discotheque, on the Iconic club of the area designed by Philippe Starck. Cities like Miami, Atlanta, and Dallas went thru a major growth spurt in the 80's, bustling w/ activity and construction, architecture, etc. you get no sense of it in this film, despite shooting in London. it seems they could've a more modern look and feel to the pic. The color scheme and design just screamed 70's!!! Films like these are not easy to make, and every time one gets made that doesn't reach its full potential it Def pisses me off. It makes it that much harder for (possibly better) projects of similar ilk to get lift off."
" Bryan Cranston dazzles, but the crime thriller, ultimately misses the punch!
",-0.7777,-0.8523,2017-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Once Breaking Bad was over, Bryan Cranston became a somewhat unlikely Hollywood leading man scoring an instant Best Actor nomination for the biopic drama Trumbo.He's returning to his secretive crime sweet-spot with The Infiltrator but instead of playing the crook, he takes on the role as an undercover cop looking to break into a massive drug cartel that stretches all the way to Pablo Escobar and take it down from the inside.There's no denying that the 1980s-set story of Bob Mazur is a riveting one and, given its basis in truth, one that should be told. It should end up as some sort of Scarface/Donnie Brasco hybrid but when all is said and done, The Infiltrator lacks the power of either.When Mazur gets close to Escobar's top lieutenant Roberto Alcaino (an excellent Benjamin Bratt), the emotions should've been running high and the scene set for a Greek tragedy but director Brad Furman's story is too on the level to resonate deeply.Put simply, The Infiltrator lacks emotion. It tells the story of an undercover agent who goes undercover and does his job quite well. It sidesteps true conflict and thus fails to stay memorable outside of the odd nicely photographed scene. Cranston gives it his all, further establishing his reputation as a dependable leading man. It's a shame that the rest of the film fails to match his ambition."
" May not be your best true story backed crime drama, a great story and good acting makes it watchable
",0.4646,0.9949,2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"I don't think there is any dispute when one says that Bryan Cranston's career took off into the A-lists after the stupendous success of Breaking Bad. He has been working in some very big movies in roles tailored for him. To a man in his position, it is easy to get swayed into accepting big money meaningless roles that would have come thick and fast post his stardom. Bryan Cranston didn't budge. Instead he used this same stardom and new found influence to get him into doing some very interesting roles and gave very passionate performances to further his legacy in acting. Pablo Escobar's drug empire might not be a very sophisticated one. It was more or less operated by may be intelligent but rather uneducated people. They followed procedures and people what the best money or intimidation could buy. In such duress, you don't get innovation - you only get workarounds. There were numerous attempts by dedicated DEA and Customs teams to poke at this clunky model and dismantle the operations, but with the reach and the money generating prowess of its business, ten more such models would crop up just as one goes down. 'The Infiltrator' is based on a real life account of one such operation, a rather successful one.Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) is a U.S. Customs Officer and is a veteran in undercover operations. The mission starts off to collect evidence against some higher members of Escobar's echelon along with his trusted associate Emir (John Leguizamo). Soon the dynamics change and the mission gets bigger with members of the cartel getting very interested with Mazur's proposal. The need to find a bank which could be talked into doing the laundering work for them arises which is when the BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) steps in. With the evidence mounting up, his life constantly in danger, personal life in shambles, he has to find a way to bring all players under a single roof for indictments.Being made from a real life account of Robert Mazur, one would imagine the story to be opinionistic and highly perspective. However the makers had made sure they take an objective route in telling their story but does indulge in some personal views of Mazur. The idea of choosing BCCI (the biggest product of Pakistan on international stage) amongst many other options isn't well shown. The direction is upbeat especially with John Leguizamo's histrionics and members of Medellin cartel's lifestyle. It has Bryan Cranston playing the lead and another seasoned Hollywood actress Diane Kruger playing a crucial role, with everything going for it - there seems to be something missing throughout the movie making it incomplete. The attention to detail for the period is done well, the background score always is high spirited and apt, the color theme and cinematography adds into the period feel. It has its moments of emotional depth where the characters of Mazur and Kathy (Diane Kruger) has to walk a thin line between the new friendships they are making and the knowledge of the fact that they are also collecting evidence to eventually bust them. Considering the story is backed by a real life account which already has a huge conspiracy undertone, intriguing twists and involves a popular figure like Escobar looming over it - I felt the resulting movie could have been a little more engaging than it turned out to be.May not be your best true story backed crime drama, a great story and good acting makes it watchable."
" A great retelling of a true undercover drama in the 80s
",0.7845,0.992,2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"The InfiltratorIn some ways this might seem like a straight up crime and drugs movie, with Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston in the leading role. But these true events and actual characters take you to the top of a government effort to undercut the money laundering operations of the biggest cartel of all.And Cranston is great. Around him is a really strong cast, including some disreputable types from all around. The pressures are huge, and the tension believable as people question who they can trust. Because to go undercover requires people helping you keep your cover, and that's increasingly hard because the money, and the low price of a life, are constant pressures.The movie is based in Florida in the 1980s, and it's a weird place to revisit. Diane Kruger is a great, relaxed presence once she shows up, and John Leguizamo is terrific as a sidekick, essential to the energy of the film.There some problems, for sure, with compacting the plot or characterizing Escobar. Or making the private life of the main agent so easily intertwined with the undercover worldâthey should be states apart. But never mind the quibbles. A strong, commanding movie."
" Gripping and full of suspense, while feeling totally realistic and grounded
",0.128,0.9921,2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"This is a movie, that will have you at the edge of your seat. And it doesn't rely on cheap tricks to get you there, like the ticking clock of a near terrorist attack or family members of our hero being taken by the bad guys. The suspense comes from the plot itself and the actions of the main characters, which seem to be too daring to be true; and yet they are. The movie starts with undercover cop Robert Mazur, played by Bryan Cranston, in the final stage of an operation. After his job is done, he is offered an opportunity to retire and live a life on a yacht with his family ""or whatever white people do, when they retire"", as John Leguizamos character puts it in one the funnier moments of the film. But then he is given a chance to work himself right into the heart of Pablo Escobars drug cartel; not by following the drugs, but by following the money. So he takes on the role of mobster Robert Musella and finds himself in a situation, where the just slightest mistake, ""just one slip"", could get himself and his undercover colleagues killed. It's this razor's edge situation, that makes ""The Infiltrator"" so compelling and gripping. It is based on a true story and you can clearly see, that Bryan Cranston, who is credited as executive producer as well, is very invested in the material. His performance of a performance is awesome, but luckily the movie doesn't rest on his shoulders alone. John Leguizamo, Benjamin Bratt and the fabulous Diane Kruger do a fantastic job as well. One of the greatest achievements of the movie is, that it feels no need to exaggerate the story. There is a scene, in which Bryan Cranston's character is in the kitchen with one of the main bad guys preparing dinner. This conversation alone is so full of heavy tension, Benjamin Bratt could slice it with the knife, he is using in that particular scene in remarkable fashion. It is fantastic acting and movie direction and that is just one example of many similar scenes. The plot of The Infiltrator sure isn't one, we haven't seen before in movies. But rarely it has been delivered that effectively without the need to use heavy effects."
" I'm all in for 'The Infiltrator'!
",0.0,0.9626,2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"We've seen quite a few movies and even TV shows that cover the Pablo Escobar story and his drug cartel over the years. Some have been great where others missed the mark. Here with 'The Infiltrator', you never really see Pablo Escobar, but only in passing as the story follows real-life US agent Robert Mazur or as his undercover name Bob Musella, played by Bryan Cranston, who is no stranger to the drug business (Breaking Bad). Robert Mazur went deep undercover to unlock and take down Pablo Escobar's drug business, along with his right hand men.What director Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer, Runner Runner) does here that makes this film stand apart from the rest in this genre, is strictly focus on the tension of going undercover in this nasty cartel business. There are some fairly intense moments of brutal killings and violence, but that all takes a back seat as we see all the moving parts come together to make this a successful operation, by showing how Mazur balances his home life, creating fake aliases and marriages, to even opening up bank accounts and becoming very friendly with the deadliest of Pablo Escobar's crew.You'll be on the edge of your seat for sure throughout the whole film, hoping that Cranston's character isn't figured out. Speaking of Cranston, he does a phenomenal job as Robert Mazur and the ruthless businessman Bob Musella. It was almost like a return to the 'Breaking Bad' character of Walter White and Heisenberg, where one was a good family man and the other was a volatile and scary individual. It's a little more toned down here, but it works on all levels. His partner who is also undercover is Emir (John Leguizamo), who always turns in an excellent performance. Emir is the guy who takes all the scary chances here and seems a little unhinged, which also adds to the suspense of the story.Benjamin Bratt and Diane Kruger play great supporting roles as well, but Cranston and Leguizamo shine bright here. Their struggles with keeping their separate lives from their undercover ones are rough, and you can see that it truly takes a toll on them. Oh and Olympia Dukakis makes an appearance in the film and just steals the show every time she's on screen. Put her in everything! The music choices are fun and spot on for the time period and the direction is gritty, which adds that extra layer of tension. 'The Infiltrator' is a fresh look at this overly-done story and comes highly recommended!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Passable effort on a saturated topic
",0.0,-0.2355,2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"There are so many shows and films about Escobar, the people around him, the people that went against him, etc. I'm not sure why make another one. Obviously, this is about a real person, Mazur, but people watch this for ""bringing down Escobar"" not for ""Who was Robert Mazur.""A fictional film inspired by true events would've been much more interesting than a true story that is fictionalized/Hollywoodized. This film is the latter and it suffers for it.Not true enough to be a documentary nor interesting enough to be a movie. It's in the middle of nowhere.The problem with films like these is that the story is simplistic. We follow someone and see where he goes. Everyone else is a side-character. The best crime stories are ones that show both sides of it, the investigative/law enforcement side and the criminal side, give them equal time and equal attention, and then have them meet. For example, in TV land,Breaking Bad is good because it shows the DEA's investigation, the criminal world, the Mexican cartel, Gustavo, etc. and gives them all time. Shows that just show police work, a detective investigating criminals with nothing but clues and leads, is less interesting. Just as purely legal shows are less interesting, purely criminal ones and purely forensics.Obviously doing that would've needed more time, but it's possible. Single-sided stories are becoming more and more boring. Cardboard caricatures of bad guys are boring, just as perfect good-guys are boring. We want bad guys with motive, good guys that are flawed and reasons behind everything.Ultimately this film is ""Good guy Special agent vs bad guy drug dealers."" That's the whole film in black and white."

Where is the resistance, the alternate possibilities, and the basic pushback of acquaintances? Everything moves a little too easy to an end, as in the movie was written so it would end this way versus making us think it could possibly unfold differently. Tired of being spoon-fed entertainment? Tired of this overrated guy getting so many roles just because ehe was lucky enough to get the TV show with some success? He could not carry breaking bad without Dean Norris, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, Giancario Espositio, Laura Fraser, even the Salamanca brothers made that show what it was, not Cranston.
