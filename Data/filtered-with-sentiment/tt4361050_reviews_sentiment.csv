" Well made but underwhelming
",0.1406,0.3626,2021-03-06 00:00:00,5,"On the scariness meter, I would rate this one as slightly stressful. It was fairly well made and I did care about the characters. I think somewhere in the final act, I kind of lost interest because I don't remember being very tense at that point. I would not watch it again, and really, I don't think there is enough in here for me to recommend it."
" Pretty good movie (especially if you watch it in like 2020-2021, when there are not too much good horrors out there)
",0.7783,0.9928,2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"To be honest, I wasn't expect anything, I've seen the trailer, but did not think that I'll like the movie.
But it suprised me. The whole mood, and the atmosphere of the film was really great, and there were some very well placed jumpscares, and some nice twists in the story as well. Around the end of the movie, the story got a little hard to follow (for me at least), and some of the previously mentioned good jumpscares were reused several times, so for the 2nd, or 3th time, they were not as great as for first.
After all, I think, it was a pretty enjoyable movie, with good visuals, sounds, and story."
" UNINSPIRED

" Ratings given are too low
",-0.2732,0.5684,2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Even though it resembles the last Ouija movie from 2014, the storyline is not predictable and actually surprisingly interesting. The movie keeps you interested until the last minute and the ending is not predictable. Definitely worth an 8."
" Watch this, forget the other OUIJA movies
",-0.2263,0.9123,2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"If you have watched any ouija movie prior to this one, be prepared for a pleasant surprise. This film by Mike Flanagan (best known for his Hill House TV adaption) is well paced, has powerful images and an interesting, twisting storyline. You will be pleasently entertained. The acting is quite good for a horror movie.
If you haven't seen any other oujia movies yet, stop after this one. It's only downhill from here."
" Terrible!
",-0.5255,-0.7911,2020-12-28 00:00:00,2,"A great case study for film students on how to make a terrible film! IDK why, maybe the music, but there is no suspense when things are revealed and it makes the film just plod along :("
" Scary but not gory glory
",-0.7073,0.9614,2020-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie mostly because it's not one of those Glory Glory movies that seems to have taken up most of the space on the horror movie shelf. It is pretty fast paced it has also a rather good cast excellent acting and not too much CGI effects neither bad nor good which makes the movie more dependent on actual plot and acting, in my opinion it's one of the best horror movies/type of horror movie we have so far!"
" So Much Better Than The First One
",0.4902,0.9676,2020-12-13 00:00:00,8,"This was a great surprise. The original movie was ok at best so I wasn't exactly brimming with anticipation to get hold of this one.But thankfully, its great, set in 1967, they shoot it in 1976 style including the old school opening title shot and the cigarette (change reel) burns that show up throughout the film.
As its trying to emulate movies like Amityville Horror (old classic horror) it finds its place where the story works well for the era, compared to the first movie set in a more contemporary but cynical age.The cast also works much better in this film.A really good job to create something memorable coming from a fairly bland base.Well done :)"
" Absolutely great!
",0.6893,0.9779,2020-11-30 00:00:00,9,"This movie is really awesome: it's extremely creepy, due to the great special effects and especially due to young Lulu Wilson who played the possessed daughter Doris to perfection, which is so amazing, her being just 11 years old at the time! Annalise Basso as the older daughter and Elizabeth Reaser as the mother by the way do a great job too. The story is surprisingly solid, there is all through the movie a wonderful sinister atmosphere, and the well-dosed jump-scares are intelligently done. The last scene gives us the obligatory but a bit cliché final twist to indicate that the horror isn't over yet, but hey, I can forgive them, everything else is so great! I'm not that keen on many other movies of the Ouija-franchise, but this one is really a big and pleasant surprise."
" Surprisingly Good
",0.6249,0.9968,2020-11-24 00:00:00,9,"Although there are certainly some unoriginal elements at play, Ouija: Origin of Evil is an endlessly charming, creepy, and deeply atmospheric take that is quite well written and even better directed. Coming from someone who is such an avid hater of the first Ouija film, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. Granted, some elements of this film seem a bit too familiar to go for what the film was trying for. Director Mike Flannigan does direct the film well, but even he can't help the fact that the script can be similar to that of The Conjuring film's as well as the Insidious franchise. However, he manages to keep his cool throughout this entertaining flick, and through the film's wonderful and talented cast on screen, and the endlessly chilling atmosphere Flannigan is known for. It isn't the scariest film of the year, but it certainly can be rather intense, and I enjoyed that the film was more than your typical horror movie jump scares, which I always appreciate a film for doing. It's cinematography is excellent, I enjoyed the 1960s setting, and they truly utilized ever but of that. Actresses Lulu Wilson, Annalise Bazzo, and Elizabeth Reaser are all great in their roles, as well as actor Henry Thomas, although Lulu Wilson certainly proves to be the film's standout. Parker Mack who plays the love interest for one of the characters feels a little wooden, and his character w bit bland, but luckily the film makes up for the fact as it goes on. I enjoyed the use of not just characterizing the characters in the film but also the objects surrounding it, and there is no doubt that the way Flannigan protests his horror, will certainly be seen as iconic in the future.
My Rating : 9.25/10"
" Ouija: Origin of Stupid
",-0.5267,-0.8431,2020-11-11 00:00:00,2,"I didn't see the original Ouija, but if it wasn't as good as this one, as some reviewers suggest, I can't even imagine how bad it must have been. This thing was trying to be scary, but it was more of a comedy. It was laugh out loud what they did to that cute, little girl to make her seem scary. What a waste of time."
" Very good
",0.4927,0.6808,2020-11-04 00:00:00,7,Perfect scary movie. Pg13...maybe pg15...acting was great.
" A lot better than it has any right to be
",0.4404,-0.844,2020-11-02 00:00:00,6,A somewhat cliche but well constructed horror with genuinely frightening scenes.
" Not Very Memorable, But Well Made
",0.467,0.9675,2020-10-25 00:00:00,6,"For a studio mandated prequel/sequel to a lousy original film, Ouija: Origin of Evil is better than it has any right to be. Bringing in Mike Flannagan to tackle this was a wise choice, but you can tell he feels boxed in by the material and perhaps some studio tampering. Things are too clean and too safe most of the time even if the great performances and smart direction do elevate the material as much as they can. There's an overuse of modern horror cliches like the CGI mouth distorting. It isn't a movie you'll want to rewatch over and over again, but for a film that could have easily ended up as garbage, it's amazing how decent it turned out."
" Not scary at all - but okay movie
",0.4878,0.2154,2020-10-21 00:00:00,5,The first ouija was terrible if you ask me. This was way better. But it felt quick and not very suspenseful or scary at all. It could have been great.
" Absolutely worth your time.
",0.2944,0.5423,2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,Better than the original this prequel wraps up the whole story. A flawed but solid horror movie is fun and a throwback to the great 70s horror movies.
" It didn't quite do it for me
",0.0,-0.9493,2020-10-08 00:00:00,2,"I probably had too many expectations, but the film wasn't quite the right thing for me and I left the movie theater quite disappointed. You could even hear people laughing and yawning in the cinema at some really odd scenes that were supposed to be scary but instead had a humorous effect in the audience. I don't think it brought anything new to the table. It wasn't that scary, it wasn't even psychologically solid or dramatic, and it was full of horror clichés and over-recycled elements. I'm super anti-elitism and I try to find the good parts in so many ""objectively"" bad movies, but in the case of this one I'm just shocked a lot of people gave it a high rating, especially if comparing to so many horror films that came out around that year that were notably better and scarier."
" Nothing new but it's solid
",0.2263,0.7703,2020-09-24 00:00:00,6,"A well crafted and creepy posession horror about a widow and her two daughters who work together to fake clairvoyance and hold phony seances. Things get real when they buy a Hasbro Ouija Board. The movie doesn't really bring anything new to a genre that is reaching saturation point, but the cast is quite good and its well made with a few good scares."
" Ouija: Origin of Evil
",-0.6597,-0.998,2020-09-06 00:00:00,5,"Ouija was a fairly disappointing scary movie,so I naturally didn't have my hopes high for a follow-up, and this one was a prequel, but it was rated better by critics, so I gave it a chance, directed by Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Hush, Doctor Sleep). Basically, set in Los Angeles in 1967, Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) is a young widower who works from home as a spiritual medium, assisted by her daughters, 15-year-old Paulina ""Lina"" (Annalise Basso) and 9-year-old Doris (Lulu Wilson). While others would see Alice as a fraud and scam artist, she tells her daughters that she is providing a service that makes people feel better. The family are still grieving following the recent death of Roger (Michael Weaver), Alice's husband and the girls' father. After visiting a convenience store, Lina spots a Ouija board, and suggests to her mother using it in her readings. While trying out the board, Alice unknowingly contacts a spirit named Marcus (Doug Jones) that takes possession of Doris. Alice receives a notice that the bank will foreclose their home. Doris communicates with the board, believing she will contact her dead father. The spirit leads her to secret stash of cash in the basement. Following this, the family the Ouija board, believing it is indeed Roger. The board answers a question only Roger would know the answer to, and Alice is thrilled and starts believing she is communicating with her dead husband. Lina is becoming disturbed with the change in Doris, and finds papers she has written in Polish, a language she does not know. She takes these to Father Tom Hogan (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial's Henry Thomas), her School Principal, to translate. Worried, Father Tom has a Ouija session himself, claiming he wants to contact his dead wife Gloria. The session appears successful, but Father Tom later explains to Alice and Lina that, having read the pages, that they are in fact in contact with a Polish immigrant named Marcus, who was taken captive during World War II by a sadistic doctor who conducted experiments on him and other captives inside the house's basement. These spirits knew answers that only Roger would know because they have been watching the family since they moved in. Meanwhile, Doris kills Lina's new boyfriend Mikey (Parker Mack) when he comes to visit. When they find the body, Father Tom, Alice, and Lina burn the Ouija board in the furnace. Father Tom finds the secret room where the experiments were conducted and is possessed himself. He attacks Alice and Lina but is eventually killed by Doris. Alice is captured, while the unconscious Lina is carried to her bed by the spirit of Roger. Recalling some doll's mouths with their mouths stitched, Lina realises that she must sew Doris's mouth shut to quiet the spirits' voices and end the evil. She fights the evil spirits and manages to sew mouth shut but kills Doris in the process. Doris's ghost wakes up and she is happy to be reunited with Roger. Lina explains to Alice that she had to sew her mouth to stop the voices. The spirits then possess Lina and stab Alice with a knife, but the spirits eventually leave her body. Alice tells Lina that it was not her fault, she is to blame for getting the board. Alice sees the spirits of Roger and Doris happily together and then dies herself, leaving Lina devastated. Lina is later committed to a mental hospital for the suspected murder of her mother and sister. She tells her doctor that she knows she will never be alone again. As Lina is left alone in her room, she tears up the carpet and creates a makeshift Ouija board on the wooden floor with her blood. She summons the spirit of Doris, but unintentionally summons the spirit of Marcus. The now elderly Lina (Lin Shaye) is seen, 47 years later, still institutionalised, and is visited by someone claiming to be her niece, leading to the events of the original film. Also starring Halle Charlton as Ellie, Alexis G. Zall as Betty, Hush's Kate Siegel as Jenny Browning, and Forrest Gump's Sam Anderson as Mr. Browning. Reaser is reasonable as the fraudulent fortune-teller who finds something to fear, the two young actresses playing her daughters do well, and Thomas is memorable as the priest. It isn't the scariest film I've seen, there are only one or two jump scares, but it is eerie and creepy enough, and the story is reasonably interesting, it's certainly better than its predecessor, an alright supernatural horror. Worth watching!"

" An Unfortunate Review.
",-0.4588,-0.2633,2020-05-29 00:00:00,3,"Well the day has come, I've found a Mike Flanagan film that I didn't enjoy in the slightest. It was so predictably unoriginal that I was actually bored. And it pains me to write a review that's not gushing about his work, but I just can't give it to this one. I was intrigued by the opening and I thought it was an interesting angle having a faux psychic become exposed to the supernatural elements. But there wasn't enough original substance to hold my attention for long."
" I must admit it. I am not a fan of MIke Flanagan.
",-0.0418,0.909,2020-03-20 00:00:00,5,"I've always found Mike Flanagan's movies to be quite overrated, and this movie is for me the best example for why I think that.It's just a bland and unmemorable movie. Never really scary and only ocassionally creepy. It has some good ideas but is held back by having to expand on the lore of its awful predecessor. I like the look and the style of it, but I just wished it offered more than a well made but generic story.It starts strong but quickly descents into pure over the top horror loudness. It reminded me a lot of The Conjuring (another well-liked horror film that I'm not a big fan of for similar reasons).Most of Flanagan's movies I've seen are ok at best.
I just think his work is not for me."
" A surprising sequel
",0.2732,0.9575,2020-03-05 00:00:00,8,"You wouldn't expect any movie to make a 'better than the original' sequel, especially if the first movie was terrible, but Ouija Origins of Evil is a fantastic sequel that has great scares, terrific acting, and a clever plot. Way better than the original."
" A lot better than the first one
",0.4404,-0.5994,2020-02-06 00:00:00,6,A lot better than the first one. There is something about horror films that take place before the time we had cell phones that just make them creepy. This film kept going from normal to creepy really fast that made it a solid horror movie.
" Respectable horror with a few chills.
",-0.2023,0.5984,2020-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Watching this prequel to the 2014 original puts me in mind of horror stories for the Disney generation. That is no criticism - the acting here is fine, and it is always a relief to find that the child performers are not at all like the petulant brats often found in these types of film. Perhaps children were better behaved in the 1960s, when this is set. Lulu Wilson is particularly good in her role of young Doris, youngest of the Zander family, a role for which she has rightly received much praise.This is an entirely respectable production. There are a few creepy moments, but little that will thrill you beyond the few moments they are on screen. The period atmosphere is conveyed well, and although this leads directly into the following film, it is fairly enjoyable in its own right.As with any family-friendly horror - and there is nothing here to unreasonably shock the viewer - it doesn't go beyond superficial, which is fine. A couple of gory moments towards the end will make the younger viewers wince a little, but beyond that, it is undemanding stuff. My score is 6 out of 10."
" Great horror film, not quite as creepy as Ouija (2014)
",0.1027,0.9276,2020-01-08 00:00:00,8,"I have the disadvantage here of having already seen Ouija (2014) first. Origin of Evil did not scare me as much as the original, partly because I knew what was coming, and partly because some of the scares were duplicated. Other than that this iteration takes much longer to actually become a thing of rising horror. Mind you, that build up is beautifully done. In the special features part of the dvd the filmmakers make clear they took the period aspect of the movie (the 1960s) very seriously, figuring, rightly, that doing so would allow the horror to develop more successfully and believably. In this they were successful. The actors went to their parts with a real commitment and it shows. The little girl is probably as profound a part as that played by the little girl in Poltergeist (1982), although in this the part is much more demanding. There are good special effects and a few stunts, done well and suitably spooky or shocking. Origin of Evil is a fantastic horror movie and a welcome addition to the original. If you haven't seen either then consider seeing this one first. There are significant differences which are important, allowing Origin of Evil to stand upon its own merits, which is why I'm happy to give this movie a high score."

" Ouija: Origin of Evil by I.M. Nosferatu #Nosferreview
",-0.6597,-0.9986,2019-12-02 00:00:00,8,"I know evil. I know it when I see it. I know it when I hear it. I know it when I touch it, taste it, and smell it...you get the picture. And let me tell you, it was no damn coincidence that my parents dropped the moniker I. M. Nosferatu on me - they tell me that it was because I had such an otherworldly scream right out of the womb. But I digress...Suffice it to say, I've always accepted that I'm evil incarnate; and with that comes a certain responsibility - a responsibility to filter out the real deals from the hoaxes when it comes to the wicked, the malevolent, the vile, and most anything related to the spirit world. So when I hear that so-called scientists - you know, the namby-pambys in the white coats with all their degrees hammered on the walls - spew their ""facts"" that a Ouija board is fake, phony, or otherwise just a party game for pre-pubescent teeny boppers wearing p.j.s and telling ghost stories in mommy's basement, I get angry. Fever pitch angry. And I see red. Do they really believe that the planchette (for those of you who haven't had the pleasure, a planchette is the triangular-shaped pointer on the Ouija board) only moves because of ""the unconscious movements of those controlling it"" - some obnoxious phenomenon they call the ""ideomotor effect""? Sounds more like the idiotic effect if you ask me, and that's just plain b.s. According to the rest of us nefarious folk - and we run in packs of thousands, mind you - the Ouija is a portal to the spirit world. It's not all freak and fear though - because it can be used for both evil and good (not that I'm a fan of the latter). Just google away and you'll find thousands of horrific stories - everything from raising the dead to demonic possession. If you don't believe me, I have my own Ouija and talk to the dead all the time - come on over for a visit and we'll have quite the night - Krugerian level fun to be had.But for those of you who just want your jollies vicariously, Ouija: Origin of Evil is a fairly sick flick. And certainly it's ill-er than its predecessor, Ouija. Does it merit that Kugerian level of a visit to my house or even an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes? I have to say, it's not Ripper smooth for hardcore horror, paranormal, or occult fans, but I can see where the muggle population would be more accepting (and forgiving) of its flaws. Certainly Hasbro is happy that the public likes one of its movies for a change and I'm certain Ouija board sales will spike no matter what the inherent risks of its use may be.Ouija: Origin of Evil is a period piece, taking place in Los Angeles circa 1965 depending on which source you use. Single mother Alice Zander, played by veteran horror actress Elizabeth Reaser (the hot mama Esme Cullen from the Twilight franchise), scrapes by making a living and raising her two daughters by scamming muggles who want to talk to their dear departed ones. Her daughters Doris Zander (Lulu Wilson from Annabelle 2 and Deliver Us from Evil) and Lina Zander (from Oculus) are willing participants in the scam and actively take part in the séance shenanigans that serves as window dressing for the gullible muggles.Alice decides to turn up the heat with some Ouija board action. Little Doris takes to the board like a maggot on a dead carcass. The next thing you know, it's the scene out of Ghost where Whoopi Goldberg finds out she has the shine. It seems Alice's mother was a ""real"" clairvoyant and just maybe the gene skipped to Little Doris. (I kid you not; that's right out of the script). Demonic possession (you can always tell victims of demonic possession by the pure white contact lenses they wear) occurs and all hell breaks loose - literally. It was nice to see how Henry Thomas (Elliot from E.T.) has grown into manhood and plays the sympathetic and rather naïve Father Tom Hogan.At its best, Ouija: Origin of Evil is a slow build to a somewhat predictable and milk-toasty climax. At its worst, for diehard, uncompromising horror aficionados like myself, it's totally derivative and like E.T. following the Reese's Pieces, one can see the trail and trappings of past horror classics. Doris Zander, for example, is but a toned-down Linda Blair-clone, sans the head spin and pea soup. While Henry Thomas made a credible performance as the requisite faith-plagued Irish Catholic Priest, he certainly was no Jason Miller or Max Von Sydow. There are elements of Poltergeist including a house buried over the dead. And speaking of Ouija boards and their cinematic use, The Exorcist was one of the first films to introduce the Ouija as a possible portal to the spirit world. From there, the cult classic Witchboard starring White Snake's main squeeze at the time, Tawny Kitaen, forever established the Ouija board as an instrument of evil. That film was totally sick, Ripper smooth, and gets my I.M. Nosferatu Medal of Honor. Special bites in that film must go to Kathleen Wilhoite as the wacky psychic, Zarabeth.But enough about Witchboard. This movie was written by Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard. Despite its limitations, Flanagan's excellent direction raised it above the usual genre fare. Having previously directed Hush, Oculus, and Absentia to name a few, he's developing a real John Carpenter-esque style which I, for one, am certainly looking forward to seeing how it develops in future projects.On the Krugerian scale of horror, Ouija: Origin of Evil is a thin layer of ectoplasm compared to the thick viscosity of these other horror films. But while Ouija is no Witchboard, it's better than watching reruns of Ghost Hunters."
" Really bad movie
",-0.5849,-0.9545,2019-10-29 00:00:00,1,"Im a fan of horror movies. This flic though was a real waste of time. Bad acting which only got worse along the way. If someone tried to make Exorcist fan movie with no skills and made the story up while filming, this could be the result. Reminded me of some Ed Wood movies in a bad way. Do not waste your time would be my advice. If it only was even worse, it could be at least interesting."
" Deft Direction and Stellar Acting Carries the Movie
",0.0,-0.9908,2019-10-28 00:00:00,7,"If you first ""Ouija"" film, you might have been inclined to skip this addition (a prequel) to the series. No one would blame you. ""Ouija"" is a laughably awful film. ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" however, is a surprisingly competent and thoroughly enjoyable horror movie.Perhaps it should not come as a surprise that ""O of E"" turned out so well. With the steady guidance of director Mike Flanagan (Hush, Oculus, Haunting of Hill House), one of the most consistent creators of scary stories in the business, we should expect high quality work. Once again, he delivers.The story revolves around a recently widowed mother and her two daughters. At risk of losing their old, creepy and possibly haunted (definitely haunted) house, the mother resorts to work as a fake medium to make money, calling on her daughters to contribute to the ruse. Things get more exciting when the mother brings home a Ouija board, not knowing that sinister spirits would soon possess her younger daughter.Then, as we witness the little girl's behavior grow increasingly strange, our goosebumps grow increasingly prevalent (because creepy little girls are a reliably freaky scary movie trope). The older sister soon suspects something, the little girl crawls on walls, and a priest shows up to help. That stuff is predictable and somewhat unoriginal. But this movie still works because of its splendid acting - the little girl, Doris (Lulu Wilson), is particularly impressive - and deft direction.Mike Flanagan clearly knows how to run the show. He makes sure that ""O of E"" becomes a far cry from other horror movies of this ilk, which possess so little inventiveness in their direction.With this film, we are treated to elegant camera movement, unnerving closeups, and evocative framing and angle choices that all appear purposeful and thought through. Instead of calling attention to an evil presence on screen with a hard cut, we simply see a shadowy figure crouching on the edge of the frame.Flanagan also chooses to include limited jump scares and, mercifully, no fake jump scares. Fake jump scares are what I call those moments of building tension when the sound goes silent, then suddenly there's a blast of jarring noise that makes us jump out of our seats as the camera reveals a harmless friend character. It's a cheap manipulation, a dirty trick. We deserve better, and Flanagan gives us better.Rather than turning to a loud and bombastic score to sell scares, Flanagan relies on the editing and our natural inclinations as viewers to feel scared. He trusts that when something scary that unexpectedly appears in front of us on screen, it will deliver chills.""O of E"" delivers a slow-building eerie viewing experience. There are no excessive bursts of violence. Nothing is over-the-top. It's a small-scale movie, but one that is nonetheless effective. I recommend it to any fans of possession movies, especially if you prefer ones devoid of gore."
" typical location, story, effects
",0.0,-0.887,2019-10-18 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie for the first time more than while rewatching. It is indeed scary and higher quality than most horror movies. Ideal story, characters, location, effects for typical horror movie. Effects are scariest, then the story. But one thing I can complain about is too typical effects which although are scary, are somehow too common, sudden, and not supported or caused by any specific reason, science, explanation. Instead they are just like that so spontaneous, sudden, appearing without a reason at all. And typicallity of all of it makes it look unreal. Had there been more real explanation for such effects or story, or and resolved the end, even if negatively, it would appear more real and deserve 10 stars. Bit unfinished and not enough convincing, aka lacks reality."

Most of the action comes at the very end, and it's a little too late. I have a few problems with the questionable decisions in this movie... who would let there kid play with a Quija board? Why is the mom so obtuse? And why does everyone generally have an almost careless attitude about the whole thing? Linas boyfriend is hanging from the staircase and the mom goes ""... we have to find your sister"" umm like, what?"

" Better Than The First
",0.4404,0.9398,2019-07-16 00:00:00,6,"It's rare to find a sequel that surpasses the first these days, but Ouija: Origin of Evil manages to just that. Not that it was a very tough feat considering the original was one of the most lame-brained movies I've seen in a while, but Origin of Evil improves upon its predecessor tenfold - just not enough to make it really worthwhile.It's obvious that Mike Flannigan is on his way to becoming one of our true masters of horror, but this film seems more like a paycheck movie for him and it shows. He does the best he can with the tepid material, but ends up using the old ""distorted faces/mouths with rolled back eyes"" effect a few too many times and it quickly becomes tedious.Like all of Flannigan's films, it's wonderfully well cast and beautifully put together. I just wish they'd spent a little bit more time with the script. You might be better off watching Flannigan's Hush, Absentia, Gerald's Game, Occulus, or The Haunting of Hill House."
" Terrible
",-0.4767,-0.8807,2019-06-24 00:00:00,2,Poor execution of ideas and weak storyline. There's nothing in the movie that scares you except one scene where you find the man in the mirror. A total waste of time.

" The Scariest Movie I have Ever Seen
",0.0,-0.9586,2019-06-10 00:00:00,10,"I eat horror movies for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've seen it all. In my experience, there are two types of horror movies: those that you can watch many times and enjoy the story as well as the scares, such as Drag Me to Hell, 1408, Resident Evil, Final Destination, etc. And then there are those that are full of scares of all kinds (particularly jump scares), but you may not want to watch many times, because story-wise they are just not as interesting or varied as the horror movies of the first category. For me, Ouija: Origin of Evil falls into the latter category. It is by far the scariest movie I have ever seen. I jumped at least 20 times during this movie, which is a record in and of itself, and 4 times I felt as if someone poured a full bucket of ice-cold water all over me and chills were sent down my spine. That is yet another record. The jump scares here are surprisingly effective. The acting, cinematography, music score, and atmosphere are top-notch, but it's not one of those movies that I would want to watch more than twice unless I watch it, say, 5 or 10 years from now, when I have forgotten about the movie and enjoy the jump scares again, because the jump scares will stop being effective the more you watch the movie, and the story is not really something that I would want to watch more than once. It's about a Ouija board after all.Anyway, the jump scares alone win this movie a 10/10. Strongly recommended."
" Actually a pretty good horror film if you're looking for scares.
",-0.0,0.9677,2019-05-10 00:00:00,10,I gave this movie a go the other day and found it surprisingly effective.

It's tired, predictable stuff for sure, an insipid picture from Blumhouse Productions that goes through the same old material we've seen countless times. The cast is uninteresting, with former child star Henry Thomas wasted as the investigating priest, and the CGI stretched-mouth scares are laughable."
" Promising first half but then falls apart..
",0.2144,-0.7213,2019-04-19 00:00:00,5,"Prequel to the disappointing Ouija. Nicely set in 1967, so we are treated to cars and fashions from that period, which also means no 21st Century annoying brats! I thought the first half was slowly but surely building to something genuinely intriguing. But that sadly started to fall apart at the first sight of of a bad spirit that looked like an alien dressed in a gimp outfit! From then on it becomes ever increasingly silly, with big plot holes (the discovery of a secret laboratory in the basement, used after the end of WW2 by a former Nazi, which comes complete with still working electrical lights! Yeah, yeah, whatever). I disagree with some reviewers, the acting I felt was fine. The film does deliver a few good scares early on, trouble is they lose their power after a while. And that's the problem - the makers threw too much at the audience and I just became immune to it.
Better than the original, though that is not saying much. However, still only an average horror movie, and further proof that the name Blumhouse is not a guarantee for success.
Stay tuned to the end credits, there is a brief but relevant post credit scene."

" Prequel that Improves on the Original
",0.6249,0.9996,2019-04-05 00:00:00,7,"This prequel to Ouija I was really interested in checking out due to it being written and directed by Mike Flanagan. I actually only checked out the original to ensure if there was any carry over, I would know it. To get into this, the synopsis is in 1967 Los Angeles, a widowed mother and her daughter add a new stunt to bolster their séance scam business by inviting an evil presence into their home, not realizing how dangerous it is.Something I can really say about this film is that it really authentic about when it was set. From how they dress, their speech and even how the Ouija boxes look. That is something I wanted to touch on and was really impressed by. It kicks off with Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) as she is having a séance with Mr. Browning (Sam Anderson) and his daughter Jenny (Kate Siegel). They ask questions to his passed away wife and are freaked out when a presence is there, behind a curtain. It ends up getting too intense and the two leave. Alice decides not to charge them from what happened.It turns out though that they are running a scam. The candles that blow out during are done by the youngest daughter, Doris (Lulu Wilson). The presence we saw was the other daughter Lina (Annalise Basso). We learn from some interesting scenes that the father has passed away. The family is trying to get on without him, but it is a struggle. Doris is carrying on like he is just not home while Lina is acting out. We see her sneak out that night to go to a party. It is here that we meet a boy who has a crush on her, Mikey (Parker Mack) and we get introduced to an Ouija board and the rules of them. The party is broken up and Alice has to pick her daughter up.Lina makes a comment about buying an Ouija board for their scam and Alice does that. She comes up with a way to make it move without using her hands. She actually also tries to play it, but can't get it to work. Doris tries later that night and thinks she is talking to her father.Doris slowly changes and her family realizes that she actually has contacted spirits. Alice decides to actually use this to help those that seek her out, but the problem is the spirits they are contacting might not be the ones they think. Doris has a dark entity that is latching on to her. They do seek the aid of the principal at the Catholic school the girls attend, Father Tom (Henry Thomas), to help save the daughter and the family.I've already touched on the realism of time period, as being good. The other thing that I really have to give to Flanagan was he incorporated things from the original as well. The original film I didn't find to be that good and had problems. When Doris first contacts the spirit, it spells 'Hi Friend'. This is a recurring motif in the other film. This is the only time that we see it, but I thought it got a bit repetitive in that film. The rule to not play alone is used again, but this one builds on the mythology of not playing in a graveyard, which I thought was a good touch.Going from there, being that this was a prequel you kind of know how things are going to happen. I have to admit though, despite that, this film has a much more interesting storyline. Any sequel or prequel really needs to take the good things from the previous film and to build more on the story. I actually think that this one does that. They also use looking through the planchette, you can see the entities. This gives the history of the entities, why they are there and what they are doing. I was concerned for a bit that it wasn't going to sync up, but I definitely like how it plays out. It actually even explains why the events in that film happen, which is a plus.With that, I'd say that the film's editing is good as well. The film has a normal runtime and it moves through at a good pace. I was never bored and it kept me engaged. I heard good things about this one, but the original had me slightly intrigued how it could play out. For this, I definitely wanted to know more as things were revealed, which it definitely did. It was well done.The acting of the film was something that was really good as well. I have noticed is that Flanagan likes to use the same actors for his films. Basso who was previously in Oculus is our main character. I thought she did a really good job in this and I was quite impressed. I do want to see her do more in the genre for sure. Reaser was good as the mother. She has an interesting position of needing money, but also needing to do what is right. I thought it gave the film an added dimension. Wilson intrigued me as she is a cute kid. Some of the lines she said made her quite creepy and the duality of her character was solid. Thomas was good as the priest. I like that he has enough doubt early on, but the more the evidence presents. Doug Jones makes an appearance in this film as a ghoul. I'm always a fan of his work whether he has lines or not, he can do a lot with just movements and physical acting. Also want to shout out the small appearance by Siegel as well. The rest of the cast round the film for what they needed.Effects for the film were something else that I thought were well done. This film doesn't really rely on jump-scares too much, which I'm glad they went away from. The look of Jones was pretty creepy. I thought the glowing eyes were a good touch. Something else that was good was the eyes of those that are possessed. Making them completely white I thought was a creepy effect. I do believe there was some CGI in this film, but it didn't bother me. The effects were pretty solid I would say.Now with that said, this film is the rare case where the prequel is much better than the original. I thought this one had just a much more interesting story, even though I know how it was going to end. It introduced us to more mythology while ensuring that everything lined up as it was supposed to. It was edited together in a way that kept things moving and made me interested in seeing what happened next. Coupling with that was good acting and effects. The soundtrack of the film really didn't stand out to me, but it also didn't hurt it. I definitely think this is an above average film and I'm still impressed by all of the films I've seen from Flanagan. I would recommend this one for sure if you like ghost, haunted house or possession films."
" Is this a parody of a horror movie?

But I admit maybe the movie deserves 3.5 because the first 30 minutes of it were not that bad. However, after that most of the scenes were either ridiculous or very boring and predictable. And this special effects looked so cheap made. I don't know how someone can think this is a good horror movie or a good movie at all."
" Really good
",0.4927,0.9286,2019-03-12 00:00:00,8,"I saw this one with low expectations since the first Ouija-movie was so-so...but, boy, did I enjoy it! The actors (especially the Child actors) were great and the effects were creepy and cool. Mike Flanagan is truly a great director and (if you haven´t already) check out his other Movies (Hush, Oculus, Before I Wake and The Haunting of Hill House-series)."

But it's extremely hard to do a horror movie that isn't.The pacing and overall ambience is quite good just as the acting. It won't win an ""original horror movie"" award, but will keep you entertained for 90 minutes or so.I wanted to give it a 6 but went with a 7 because of the acting.Perhaps a bit more suited for families or people not used to the genre. It's a bit generic, which is not a bad thing for this crowd.If you don't expect greatness you'll enjoy it."

" Unoriginal, lacks creativity, but one of the scarriest films I've ever watched.
",0.2023,0.951,2019-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I am mainly confused. While the exposition and framing story are quite original, the plot is anything but and is as cookie-cutter as they come. If you've ever watched a film about an Ouija board haunting then you already know exactly what's going to happen. You could even guess some of the characters without watching a trailer. No actual plot twist, nothing slightly innovative or smart about the turn of events, nothing but the same old features to which we've grown tiresomely accustomed. Then why, oh why, was this film so great and entertaining? I truly ask myself that.Perhaps it was the absolutely terrifying manner in which the hauntings were portrayed and presented, both in means of visual effects and cinematography. Yes, there are some jump scares, but they are far from being the main fear factor, as the film is by far more terrifying than physiologically startling. Besides, there are chosen few films that succeed in utilizing jump-scares in a way that doesn't feel like a cheap cheat, and this one if absolutely one of the title at the top of that list.Perhaps it was the profound acting, especially by young 11 year old Lulu Wilson as little Doris. Younger actors showing such talent always impress me, but watch out for this one, she has a very dark and horrifying future ahead of her. Besides, there's something about antagonist children that makes Horror films all the more terrifying, and while this feature is usually utilized in films portraying young sociopaths - a haunted little girl has been the stuff of nightmares ever since the classic The Exorcist. Annalise Basso was also excellent as Lina, this time given a far greater (and long overdue) role than in The Oculus. In general, acting is definitely one of the finer aspects of this film.All in all? I had a great time, was kept compelled and at the edge of my seat and honestly finished watching a little frightened to go to sleep (keep in mind I'm a 33 year old man). I honestly believe more creativity and originality in terms of screen writing and story, and a good plot twist, would have made this film a solid 10. I know I shouldn't have enjoyed it that much, I know it's not as good as I made it sound here, but it's been a long time since a Horror film had succeeded in scaring me to such extents. I'd say watch it and judge for yourselves, never believe the critics, you might love the film even more than I did and you might hate it. Personally, I'd give it a try."

Never.And, because ""Ouija"" has a PG-13 rating you can be sure that both its level of horror and its visuals of gore are gonna be toned down, big-time.And, you can also be sure that (as the story progresses) there's never gonna be any good that ever comes out of playing with an Ouija Board. Never. (even if it's strictly for laughs)Yes. ""Ouija"" did have some good production values. And, yes, there were some fairly eerie moments, throughout.But, overall - Ouija's suspense-factor was sustained for far too long which reduced its story to a purely predictable level that (ho-hum!) ended on one of the most cliched notes imaginable."

",0.5106,0.8047,2018-10-23 00:00:00,7,"The start of the movie is similar to so many other movies of the same overly saturated genre: a family with a single parent, a rebellious teenager and a sweet hearted little girl get in touch with the spirit world. The first half an hour can almost be skipped as it is riddled with clichés: not enough money to pay the bills, daughter sneaking out to see her friends, teenage romance etc. However, after making it past the first half of a pretty uneventful movie, the second part makes up for it. Of course cheap jump scares are being used on a regular basis but the atmosphere of the movie changes entirely and opts for a much darker tone, a direction that succeeds in most parts. Although the plot twist (did Nazi that coming) falls short in the end, the last 20 minutes are a hellish ride of emotions even if a lot of different scenarios are crammed into it. To conclude, this movie starts off very slow, even too slow for a movie of this genre, but then delivers a strong final punch even if the ending feels a little unsatisfying."

" Sequel Writers Beware!
",0.0,-0.9948,2018-08-05 00:00:00,4,"Did Mike Flanagan & Jeff Howard even watch the first movie? I originally gave this movie a rating of 7. I thought Lulu Wilson was spectacular and creepy. It was an original story and did have some nice creepy moments. Then I made the mistake of watching the first movie. So many inaccuracies from one movie to the next. Origin took place in 1967 as spelled out on the screen. The original movie said the pictures where from the 40s or 50s. The story in the paper in the original stated Doris was 10. In Origin, she specifically told the priest she was 9. In the original, the girls were much closer in age in the pictures. In Origin, they were at least 6 years apart. In the original, ""Paulina"" claims her mother was the one forcing Doris to let the spirits in and who sewed Doris' mouth shut. In Origin, ""Lina"" sewed Doris' mouth shut and her mother had nothing to do with the spirits invading Doris. Pauline says in the original movie ""Maybe there is more than one spirit"", but we know from Origin there were many spirits, all of the people tortured by the doctor. Again, did the writers of Origin watch the original movie? One other gripe I have: I hate, hate, hate when the vengeful spirits are the victims of someone else. If they themselves were victims of this horrible doctor, why would they then go on to hurt this little girl and her family? Why wouldn't it have been the doctor or the other spirits Marcus had referred to in his writing? That line never makes sense to me. Oh, I was hurt in my life so now I am going to hurt others after I am dead? Bad choice.Bottom line, don't make a prequel / sequel if it has no bearing on the original. I changed my rating to a 4."

It is not melodramatic or overbearing, though, and is nicely intertwined with the horror elements. Suspense is always that much more enjoyable than gore in a horror film and this one has the scares and the suspense and it is rather disturbing as well, as the little girl gets more and more possessed. The effects are really great - quite stunning, actually."
" Give your ghosts a brush, they can clean your cobwebs while they're up there!
",0.4574,0.2235,2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"It is 1967. Recently widowed Alice runs a spiritualist scam business with the aid of daughters Doris, 9, and Lina, mid-teens. Buying a Ouija board to bring in as a prop for the scam/business may not have been the most sensible move, however, as it appears to exert a malign influence on Doris.This film struck me as efficient. It does exactly what you want a horror film to do: it sets out its stall, it builds nicely, it feeds you some scares, and it delivers a climax which is exciting and adequately horrifying and then, as expected, finishes of with a chilling little postscript. It does this with a good sense of period design, with excellent performances (particularly from the two girls who play Doris and Lina) and with a feeling of genuine commitment from performers and crew. At no point does it scare you out of your pants without giving you fair warning that a scary bit is on the way. I might have wished for some plotlines to have finished differently, but I can't complain at them. I can complain at the mystery thingies, however, which were never explained in any way whatsoever - what they were, what they wanted, what they were doing, and I can also complain at how the deceased father was given a role which ultimately didn't really go anywhere.I was interested to note that whereas Japanese ghost children are black and white, wet,, have wide starting eyes, and creak like doors with rusty hinges, American possessed children have white eyes, open their mouths very wide, and scrabble along walls and ceilings. I find it helps to know the nationalities of haunted children.And so that's what happened to Elliott from E.T.!
As far as horror films go, this one works well."

",-0.3291,-0.9544,2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"'Ouija: Origin Of Evil (2016)' takes almost an hour for the various elements to come together into something that starts to seem scary, with the sinister stuff sticking to the periphery until an exposition scene that marks the start of the scare-filled final act, and the ending seems to rush itself along to a predetermined conclusion in a way which suggests the filmmakers weren't quite sure where their narrative was heading until they decided they had to tie it in to the first instalment (which I haven't seen due to its reputation as one of the worst horror films of recent years) in a meaningful way. Still, this is a visually interesting and character-driven horror feature that is well-directed and doesn't rely on jump-scares to entertain its audience. It is styled to look like a film from the 1960s, complete with the old universal logo and intermittent cue marks, so it stands out from the crowd with a colourful texture not often seen in today's colour-corrected world, though some of the visual effects end up looking a little bit ropy at times perhaps more so because they stand out from the otherwise analogue aesthetic. There's still the niggling sense that the concept isn't entirely sound, though, considering it is based upon a Hasbro-owned board-game that shows up and somehow coincidentally causes the spirits, which have supposedly been in the house for a long time before the board, to start to show themselves. 6/10"

When my expectations are high I'm disappointed, but when they low, and really, really low in this case, I'm often intrigued. And yet, that doesn't distort the fact that Ouija part two is a miracle. An awful, timeworn premise (the Ouija), a vapid predecessor, and an almost certainty a worse film than, for example, ""I know what you did last summer part two."" Turns out this one is a very, very good movie. It doesn't deserve an 8, probably more a 7, but I gave it a bump just because of the miracle."

The film tries to use bits of monster horror, dread and a little body horror for its frights, only sometimes effective.Overall a distinctly middle of the pack film that lives up to what it promises, but doesn't impress."

This is actually good. It is well-made. The characters are well-drawn and well-acted. I wouldn't say that this is breaking down any new walls but there is good in doing good work. I do have a couple of small nitpicks. For some reason, Alice and Father Tom go out for what looks like a fancy dinner. It almost looks like a date if it weren't for the characters. Second, I would keep the possibility that Doris is scamming everyone until further into the movie. It would be nice to have Father Tom uncover the whole situation as a reveal.

They use the loud orchestral pops to make you jump throughout the movie, but while cheap I found many to be chilling. The PG-13 rating took away from some of the scenes. I'm not look for gratuitous gore, but some of what occurred in the movie was simply too clean to believe what was happening. The premise of the movie is a mother of two makes a living as a psychic medium. She uses various mechanisms to put on a believable show so that she can ""provide peace"" for the families who come to see her. After deciding to add a Ouija board to her business for added effect. After her younger daughter begins playing with the Ouija board, the daughter seems to gain the gift of being able to do what her mother only pretended to do for her clients. And that's where business picks up. The movie was corny throughout, and the effects were low grade. You could practically see where the harnesses were attached when bodies were thrown about. The ending was rather clunky and sudden. I guess I generally like movies involving the Ouija board. Although it's not inherent as I wasn't crazy about the movie ""Ouija"" (2014), the movie for which this movie is a prequel. But I loved the movie ""Witchboard""(1986) and it's sequel ""Witchboard 2"" (1992). So why did I like this one? All I can say is I was entertained. Maybe I'll have to ask a Ouija board.....

" Highly enjoyable and engaging sequel
",0.7056,0.913,2017-10-07 00:00:00,9,"Trying to operate their illegal scam service, a widow and her teenage daughters running fake seances for rich clients find themselves in real trouble when an innocent game with an ouija board turns into a nightmare when they unleash a terrible evil and must stop it before it takes her over.This was quite a fun and thrilling supernatural effort. What really gives this one a lot to like is the rather strong and striking action played out throughout the film. The opening seance scene where the off-screen noises and shadows around the room lead to a belief in the supernatural that eventually turns out to be a part of their scam service gives this a strong start, while there's more to like about the way this one targets the daughters as the haunting scenes grow far more dangerous throughout the film. Many of these occur through the seance scenes that are placed in here, which allows this to take full advantage of its premise with the kids playing with the board on several occasions in brief, rather fun spurts to help sell their supernatural plight. Adding to the scares is the rather heartwarming factor brought into play when they realize the true nature of their ghostly visitors coming along to help them as the scene where they all see the game-play by itself and see what's been going on the entire time. By the time it changes into the more deadly and dangerous setups later on, they generate more of an impression as the frantic scenes of her getting manipulated by the ghosts in her room, the disfigurement dream she has with her sister and the series of behavioral outbursts that slowly seem to suggest something is happening to them. Once it really throws the idea of the possession into full-force, this becomes much more fun with the events inside the basement at the end which are a lot of fun and manage to really work out some fun ideas, from the revelation of the house's history and how the daughter connects to it all to the chilling supernatural action that occurs in the basement which gives this a really frantic finale. While these here work nicely for the film, it does have a few rather prominent flaws. The main issue here is the fact that there's just not a whole lot of interest in what happens in the first half. The fact that this one goes through the idea of their scam business and then moves on to their other plight really doesn't leave this one with a whole lot of interest as it simply drags on far longer than it really should. Some of the problems are based on the fact that very little of what happens here is really all that scary, as this is content to have her worry about her imaginary friends and play with the board which doesn't generate any kind of real thrills. This does lead to a longer start-up that expected and gives this a longer running time than what should really be required here. As well, the film's rating doesn't really let it go the type of extremes this could've generated as many of the scenes are the typical type found here and don't really generate much else here beyond these jump- scare setups. Beyond these issues, it doesn't have a lot else wrong.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy."
" Huge improvement on its predecessor.
",0.6486,0.7783,2017-10-05 00:00:00,7,"""Ouija"" was poorly executed and badly received, and is generally regarded as one of 2014's worst films, so it's hard to imagine anyone eagerly lining up around the block for a follow-up film. As it turns out, the prequel ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" is a massive improvement on its predecessor.Talented director Mike Flanagan – confirming his status as the latest horror maestro by adding this to his 2016 output alongside ""Hush"" and ""Before I Wake"" – has been brought in to class up the proceedings and he succeeds admirably. Flanagan captures the look and feel of 1967 Los Angeles and adds a number of neat visual throwbacks and details (such as Universal's 1963–90 logo that opens the film). ""Origin of Evil"" also has more on its mind than might be expected, raising some interesting ideas around the issues of faith, belief and the existence of an after-life, mainly via protagonist Alice (Elizabeth Reaser), and most effectively when it examines with her belief that the supernatural force in her home is her husband attempting contact from beyond the grave.The film has a number of effective frights, with the scene where Doris (Lulu Wilson) first sees a ghostly apparition through the Ouija's planchette probably being the best jump-scare. Wilson also brilliantly delivers a monologue to her sister's boyfriend about being strangled to death, an utterly chilling moment and, thanks to Wilson, one of the stand-out scenes of the film. It's also nice to see Annalise Basso back in another Mike Flanagan film, after she showed such promise in the brilliant ""Oculus"".Unfortunately ""Origin of Evil"" goes a bit off the rails in the final act. Up to this point, much of the film thrives on how the haunting plays into the family dynamic and the feelings of the characters, but this is abandoned in favor of a seen-it-all-before haunted house explanation which feels over-the-top for this particular story. The depiction of Doris' possession also becomes a bit stereotypical as the film goes on. She spider-walks up the side of a wall, stretches her mouth to inhuman lengths, whispers malevolently in the ears of other charactersall things that feel old hat (and aren't always visually convincing), unlike the aforementioned monologue scene. Ultimately it feels like ""Origin of Evil"" succumbs to typical supernatural-horror excess, making it only two-thirds a great film, and overall simply a quite good one. But for a follow-up to such a dreadful first entry into the franchise, this film is far better than anyone had a right to expect."

Elizabeth Reaser, Annalise Basso and Lulu Wilson were all flawless and carried the movie brilliantly. Each bringing their own unique personality to the film made it so much better than it would have been otherwise.Also, let's not even compare it to the previous movies in the franchise. This one takes the lead with no competition in sight. Still, as with so many horror and thrillers recently, the ending lacked conviction. Not only that, but when the story starts unfolding you might find yourself rolling your eyes to the same clichéd jump scares, dialog and story telling.That said, this definitely deserves a viewing. It won't disappoint and will even give you some nice scares through the ride. Just don't go into it expecting something unique or unexpected story wise and you'll be fine.

The atmosphere is constantly set at impending dread, the tension slow built until pic goes into overdrive. Unfortunately so many horror films of the decade are reliant on the demon formula to fill out their respective tales, so much so it has become jaded and utterly unsurprising.This hurts this picture and it runs away with itself, rendering the big final quarter - complete with emotional baggage - as something of a let down; though the final shot has goosebump value for sure.

I did find some of the flare slightly distracting, a lot of the look was probably added in post, but in general the movie is skillfully crafted.Acting is very good, especially the kid who is as good as any classic horror movie kid character.Highly recommended for horror fans.

" Very unrealistic film
",0.0,-0.4389,2017-09-10 00:00:00,5,"This film deals with the demonic possession of children from a Ouija Board.This movie had many unrealistic things happening in it, such as the planchette moving around on the ouija board without anyone touching it, Doris's mouth hanging wide open, Doris dying in an unexplained way all of a sudden at the end. When you think that there was going to be a happy or bittersweet ending, all of a sudden, it turns out to be a sad ending.Some of the characters were annoying, such as the bratty teenage girl and the bullies who intimidate Doris at school. There are some similarities between this and Annabelle: Creation, both are prequels, both star Lulu Wilson, both are a bit better in other peoples' opinions than the mediocre sequels were. But I also found an interesting comparison I found at is that Lulu Wilson's character in both movies hate boys. Doris's character gets bullied by boys in Ouija 2 and Linda's character in Annabelle refuses to talk about boys.The rest of the characters were fine, but they couldn't even save this movie. The movie just killed them off and I'd rather for Lina to not be in this movie because she was so bratty, if she was a lot nicer and sweeter, I would've not minded her being in this movie.The acting, otherwise, is the best thing about the movie. Everyone did a great job portraying the emotions of their characters and not coming off as wooden in their acting skills.Verdict: This movie is contrived, clichéd, and forced. It's not much different from your average horror film. It's got the same cliché, sweet innocent youngest girl getting possessed. Don't expect anything groundbreaking from this film."

" Let me Tell Your Fate
",0.0,0.7556,2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"Mike Flanagan has been a director to watch since his film ""Oculus"" with his Netflix movie ""Hush"" he really gave a sense to the way he directs suspense/horror movies. With Ouija: Origin of Evil he beautifully displays yet again why he is one of the best horror movie directors working today.With today's modern horror I can see why audiences find O.O.E. hardly scary at all. No jump scares, not graphic, not gory. Which is what I think to be the downfall of movie goers these days, and I cant blame them. Over and over we anticipate scary movies to be so over the top, that when a movie like Ouija comes we push aside because it didn't meet those standards of silliness. Mike Flanagan way of creating fear is by simply placing it on the screen. it is completely silent, the way it would be at your house when you think you see something in the shadows, or you hear a bump in the night. There is no loud music, no dumb jump scare to a cat popping out of the cabinet. The fear is just THERE.another credit to the director is the way he chose to direct it. The movie takes place in the 60's and boy does he really make you feel like you are in that time era. Not only with the clothes or the cars, but the way the movie is. How the title of the movie just appears on the screen with the old school font title at the bottom, to the ""cigarette"" burns you see at the top right corner of the screen as if it signals to change the reel of the film. You even see a jump in the screen as if it were really changed! All the little details to this movie is down to flawless.The acting across the board is great, with a standout performance by Lulu Wilson playing Doris. Be on the lookout for her in future films. the way she is able to deliver lines in the most bone chilling way, literally makes you quiver. ""want to know what it feels like to be strangled to death?"" Absolutely frightening!I definitely recommend this film, as it not only surpasses its the first one that was trash, but shows a new way of horror. Go in with a open mind and enjoy the film."

The things changes when her little daughter started to communicate the spirits of her own. The chaos unleashes, the house becomes haunted and the family begins to fall apart.Keeping it simple is what worked out well for the film, despite thematically borrowed from others, scenes were kind of familiar and characters intentionally developed. Particularly the priest role was the most overused in any horror film. Followed by the twist. That turning point was good, but not a new. Nice performances and well shot film.

",0.3716,-0.8507,2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"I found this movie to be very enjoyable. For those reviews that say the acting was horrible, what horror movies are they watching? Overall this was well cast, the acting was fine and the little girl was successfully creepy. This is not a gore fest or a movie with a lot of cheap scares. It was more of a slow burning psychological scare and it worked watching it late at night alone. The movie is set in the 60s and had a great story line that naturally unraveled. It has an Exorcist feel to it that is missing from most modern day horror movies. It was successful in being creep while being entertaining and the little girl's behavior was freaky particularly when she spoke to her sister's boyfriend or used her voice to enhance her performances. However, like almost all of these types of movies the story writer felt they had to explain everything by tying it into a tired story line of evil that occurred in the house. It would have been more unique and fun to just have a bad spirit that shows up. The little bit of killing just seems forced and the last 20 minutes or so are just a mess of your typical expected story-line with this type of story. Why does the spirit control itself until the last 20 minutes? Who knows, just felt like time to wrap it all up in a neat bow which ruined the story. However it is very entertaining the first 2/3 and really demonstrates you don't need gore and cussing and teenage sexual situations to present a scare and creepy psychological situation. Wish they'd do a third installment and take it in a new creative direction."

The performances are very acceptable, specially on the older sister who has some difficult scenes on her part.I enjoyed the movie's progression, it wasn't boring or anything and it had some thrilling scenes. However, it all comes down to this: you simply CANNOT do a good thriller/horror movie with bad special effects. The enlarged mouth-face you see in the trailer gives away the poor quality of CGI and that's really pretty much you're going to get when it comes to scares. This makes the movie completely ridiculous and an overall mediocre horror experience. Producers need to start understanding that if the effects are unrealistic, the movie will suck, unless it's a horror comedy, so... please just refrain from producing them in the first place.My verdict: A fun movie if you can ignore the pathetic effects.

Let me explain why..I'll begin with the good bits.. 1. the score is pretty nice, ambient but eery and a bit sad. 2. Some of the effects are pretty creepy, especially where the possession starts to fully show. 3. There is some good suspense to be had a few nail bite moments especially as it all gets a bit crazy toward the end with a possession free for all going on. 4. The young lady playing Doris shines in this movie, very talented despite being given a painfully clichéd creepy child role, she is superb. 5. The ending was a surprise, but that's probably as I haven't bothered watching ""Ouija"" due to very bad reviews. 5. The actress playing Lina has her moments also as a promising actress. 6 Character dynamics and interactions have some genuinely believable moments. The not so good bits..1. This type of story is beyond exhausted. They try to twist it with the whole "" we can make our readings more - real with this board"" but it's not enough 2. dead parent, creepy kid, bitchy rebellious teen kid, dead parent and strong but unravel parent. 3. A creepy new fad appears and things go all eery. People get possessed, people get killed and then more people get killed- no real reason as to why these spirits are killing a whole family. 4. No real closure as to what the ""other"" things with Markus are 5. The families general reaction to hanging teenager in their stairway & their dead kid/sibling is way too nonplused. I mean you kill your sister happily then come round not giving a hoot.. but freak out only when you kill your mother. 6. Given that the dynamics and interactions have such believable moments , the chronic underacting near the end just makes me frustrated. 7. The mother is seriously irritating throughout.And exploiting your child, top parenting, how does no one step in knowing her kid is skipping school to ""work"" with her? 8. Dialogue begins to drift into cliché territory near the end as do all the effects, it's just like watching a rip of the Exorcist mixed with other known themes... 9. The end just appears so suddenly. I hate it when movies begin to show promise then just race to an ending. It just escalates un naturally fast for my liking, I mean really the kid does what like 2 readings, writes loads of junk in polish then mass murders and possesses people in a couple of days if that? 10. Daddy sews up doll mouths to stop ""the voices"" was he alive/dead when he did this? and why so suddenly, I mean if these things have been in the house so long, the mother and her kids do ""readings"" all the time why suddenly does it take this kid turning out to be some insane conduit medium out of nowhere? Surely she'd have shown signs sooner? surely they would have had weird things happen sooner? Too many plot holes in this movie which is a shame as it does have promise but the lazy approach tarnishes it's ideal."

For some reason scary movie makers think that if the movie is scary, then a complete story is not needed.And a story needs to have an ending, just like music needs to have an ending. If a music stopped in the middle, you can tell it has not reached its end. And that's how it feels with this movie. There is no ending. They just run out of story, or budget."
" Watch something else.

Unlike Lights Out (that had a few elements of originality)'Ouija: Origin of Evil' follows a Mother who is running a scam fortune telling business and her two daughters who lost their dad recently. The reason I bothered to mention their dad died recently is because they mention his departure a lot, in every scene in fact. Just in case the audience forgot. The beauty of this film is that you don't have to retain any information from the previous scene because they just blurt out exposition during any moment of plot development anyway. The acting is OKAY but it's pathetic character arcs and the character's non existent personalities give the actors little to work with.I'd recommend Conjuring 2 before i'd even remotely consider recommending this crock of crap. I genuinely found myself laughing of bordem during this film especially since the mother's source of the Ouija board was at a Cafe/Diner and people's reactions to some of the events in the film were over the top on some of the minor character's behalves. all and all just about every element of this film was a let down, from the screenplay to the direction and the fact that the film is even remotely being praised because of it's homage to it's cigarette burn on the film and opening title card featuring roman numerals is not enough to redeem this disappointment in film form."
" Great Performed by Juvenile Actor in this Horror Film
",-0.0708,-0.9813,2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Although this film is a prequel so having not seen this original, it's better to start with this one. Set in 1967 Los Angeles, the story moves so leisurely one can imagine the movie audience fidgeting impatiently for the ""action"" to start. It's slow, true, but the tension does build, and the things little Doris spies through the planchette's glass are only given in tantalizing glimpses. The usual ""shock"" scene of something thrust into the viewer's face as she peers through the glass is absent, perhaps making its actual appearance even scarier.The story: A widow supporting herself and her two children by giving seances, is shocked to learn her youngest daughter has contacted her dead father through a Ouija board. When the child finds money, saying her father told her where to find it so they can pay off a foreclosure, the mother gets the idea of having the girl help her with her seances and give actual readings to clients. She keeps the child out of school to do readings and it's surprising no one investigates this since the priest who runs the school is very aware. Things go from there to worse when something not her father's spirit invades the child.There are so many moment in which the expected horrific images are given chances to appear and those are ignored, using Doris to convey them, which makes the action even more frightening.All in all, the absence of ghostly presences, with most of the spectral action conveyed through the child makes it even more frightening., though I had hoped for the father's spirit to perhaps intervene a bit. Indeed, he does little more than appear a couple of times, perhaps not being strong enough to fight the true evil lurking in the house.Anyone who's seen the original movie knows how this is going to end, but it's still frightening when it does.Good, low-key performances by all, with a truly eerie one by the child actress portraying, who carries the story.This DVD was viewed as a rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review."

Many have given it rave reviews citing quality work.I found the film very difficult to watch. It wasn't the movie that was scary, but the acting. As in scary awful. Annalise Basso delivers a convincing performance, while Elizabeth Reaser and Henry Thomas fall in line well behind. Their performances were so bad it made the movie unbearable. Unfortunately, little Lulu Wilson is slowly becoming typecast as the creepy little girl in horror movies. I think she acted the role as best she could. Not exactly a demanding role to begin with, mind you.The movie itself was incredibly predictable. If you are looking for a good horror movie to watch, find something else. I wouldn't say it is a waste of time, but it definitely isn't the best spent 90 minutes."

But at no point do I feel that I'm seeing a good movie.Everything is Manichaean. I do not believe anything. I knew it starts with a theater and then it's for real. But is it really for real? All the actors are very bad makeup and hairstyles, it seems to be rather a comic movie. Although the girl is great, until the director decides to spoil it. What do I mean? I explain it in spoiler.At no time do I feel tension, there is no tension. There are not even scares. It takes something more than a bug to scare. Not that the end spoils the film, the movie does not say anything to me for a long time.The picture could be fine, indoors it's nice, but little else.The management is superficial. He does not know how to take the movie. It does not know how to create tension. He does not know how to draw plans.I like the genre of fear, but it is that this movie is not scary.Spoiler:The reflection of the film is the sequence of the girl telling the sister's friend about the hangman. The girl is great, the camera is kept in the girl, the girl attracts you, but the director or the editor arrives, I do not know what will have been and change the plane to the boy. He just finished with the tension. Already, even if you return to the girl, you are finished with everything. He does not go up any more. As you may not realize that."

With Patience and Attention to Detail, Director/Writer/Editor Mike Flanagan continues to Hone His Horror Movies and seems to be a Caring Creator of this Low-Budget Genre.It's Clear that the Money Spent was Allocated where it was Needed and Unlike the Majority of Horror Movies it Feels Less Like Product and more Like a Production with Everyone in on the same Vibe.While the Movie Contains a Few Tropes, ""Wide-Open-Mouths"", and a few ""Obligatory Jump Scares"", it is the Pacing, Editing, and Retro-Presentation that makes this one Different among the Same.Creepy, Suspenseful, and with Characters that are Fleshed Out to make Your Flesh Crawl and You may find Yourself actually Caring about what Happens to this Family of a Widow and Two Daughters Living Alone (or are they?) in 1967.Note...This is a Prequel to an inferior Film, Ouija (2014), made by a different Team of Creators, that was a flop with Fans and Critics."

Also, the plot elements here are similar to many I've seen in this genre. However, I felt it was quite well presented with good acting from all the cast, well directed by Mike Flanagan, and solidly written by Flanagan and Jeff Howard.Overall, this film rather creeped me out and I'm still thinking about that scary ending."

I was very surprised that they were able to convey such a creepy and horrific feeling in this movie, especially with a PG-13 rating.It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares, but gives you the tension and creepy-crawlies through the telling of the story and the fantastic acting, especially the two sisters. When Doris (Lulu Wilson), talks to her sister's boyfriend about what it feels like to be choked, I got goosebumps. And when Doris who was just staring at the TV is suddenly staring at the other people in the room, you can feel the evil radiating from her.I don't jump a lot while watching horror movies, but towards the end some of the effects that they did (without CGI) had me jumping. The scene that takes place on the stairs and with the boyfriend was just perfect.I highly recommend this one, and feel like I need to make a new graphic so I can give it more than five stars!"
" Ouija being a huge improvement as a sequel but lacks scares.
",-0.1154,-0.9919,2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"Ouija: Origin of Evil being a better sequel surprisingly, even from the lowest standard that the predecessor set back in 2014. Yes, this sequel is way better, which the first movie followed with a non-existent story, terrible acting, and clichés with teens making stupid decisions. The sequel improves with about everything. All thanks to new writers and director in this film like Mike Flanagan. Who takes the story back in 1967, which does create a classic horror movie feel that has a look with tone that The Exorcist, and other classic horror movies had. From the film's editing look with color tone, cinematography, and so on. The plot follows a widow Alice (Elizabeth Reaser), who lost her husband in an accident. So raising her two daughters alone is hard enough, all while trying to pay for the mortgage. She makes money by scamming people to believing she is a psychic reader and can talk to the dead in the spiritual world. Her oldest daughter Paulina (Annalise Basso) and the youngest Doris (Lulu Wilson) are involved in it by rigging the dining room table to shake and lighting up the candles and cause a shadow effect through the curtains. Alice discovers an Ouija board game that they can use as a prop for their scamming business. Tempting to use the board to talk to her husband. With no response besides another spirit figure that decides to haunt the family in the house. The dark haunting figure possesses Doris as she mysteriously causes injuries to her bullies at school. And concerning her mother, she tries to get Father Tom (Henry Thomas) to help bring her daughter back. As they learn about the history of an old owner to the house that used his basement for a disturbing experiment. The pros about Ouija: Origins of Evil was the theme about a struggling family, dealing with a loss, and being non-believers to the spiritual world. Of course, that changes when they bring in the board game that releases a disturbed figure to possessing the youngest daughter. The plot worked with giving more leverage to actually caring for these characters unlike the first movie. Mike Flanagan's direction and script build this family dynamic as they experience this possession and are trying to save their youngest. Also, there are better performances with Elizabeth Reaser, Annalise Basso, Lulu Wilson, and Henry Thomas. The film does have some creepy factors, seeing a dark demonic figure at the end of the hallway, leaving you feeling a little on the edge. Or seeing a hanged body dangling on the ceiling with a possessed girl that can come out of anywhere. The sinister figure does have a backdrop of details that are quite disturbing, making it a scarier threat.The con about the film for being a supernatural horror movie was the lack of scares. It had a creepy eerie direction that would have worked for the best if the movie were released decades ago. I did not find the film to be scary, which did not deliver jolts or jump scares. Maybe it's just myself not finding supernatural horror movies as scary anymore. Overall, Ouija: Origins of Evil is a better film than the last, and better than expected from how the trailer looked."
" Better then the first one
",0.4404,-0.5589,2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,Not often a sequel is better than the first movie but this one actually is better. The first one was okay to watch once but Ouija: Origine Of Evil is just creepier. Good acting from that kid Doris by Lulu Wilson. There were some good scary moments that are necessary in a story like this one. I'm not going to debate about my personal experience with a Ouija board because it doesn't matter to the story. The only thing I have to say about that is that I'ma devoted atheist but that I will never ever play with a Ouija board again. But with that experience in mind you watch a movie like this one with other eyes then you would watch another horror movie. The horror in Ouija/ Origine Of Evil isn't really gory or bloody but it got my wife pretty scared a couple of times. And that's always nice to see. It was better than I expected.
" I had nightmares about Doris
",0.0,0.8842,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"I love supernatural horror, particularly ones with creepy wee children in them. Alas, pretty much every single film that's been out in recent years has been predictable, samey and actually not remotely scary. Ouija: Origin of Evil breaks the mold here, as it has good twists to its tale, is filmed a bit differently with good effects, and actually succeeded in frightening me.The child actress who plays Doris, is great! She is genuinely chilling! As a character, Doris avoids falling into the 'irritating child' bracket that befalls so many kiddie characters, and as such, is really scary. There are a couple of jumpy scares, but mainly, it's the continual feeling of dread surrounding the Horror That Is Doris that drives the film. When the twists start to come at the end, they are really quite horrible and offer a great explanation as to why this house/family are under attack. The ending is absolutely great, and avoids terrible Hollywood clichés.In short, this film is great fun. both my partner and I couldn't sleep afterwards! I had a terrible nightmare about Doris, actually. To me, if a scary film gives me a nightmare, I know it's a winner! :-)"
" Fumbles both on human and other aspect with a passable story and occasional thrill
",0.3612,0.9669,2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"There was a time when Hollywood was obsessed with period crime dramas which seemed to have spilled on to the horror genre. It could be either the higher supply of Hollywood props leading to discounts or the ease of storytelling without having to deal with modern communication and other technology. Also in the recent times this genre has collectively matured into a less gory and more character driven plots and sometimes featuring popular actors. Ouija, the popular childhood game to invite spirits to answer silly questions forms the basis of this plot but it gets more irrelevant as the story unfolds.Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) is a recently widowed mother of two - teenage Lina (Annalise Basso) and 9-year old Doris (Lulu Wilson). She runs small scams as a fortune-teller or as someone who talks to spirits out of her house with her daughters as accomplices. She purchases a Ouija board when suggested by Lina for adding it to her props. When they get a notice of foreclosure for her house, Doris finds a package full of money hidden in their basement by previous tenants. This discovery along with solving their present crisis, also brings forward Doris's abilities to really communicate with the spirits that booms her business. Is Doris able to positively use her new ability or is she getting consumed by it?The movie establishes a moderately happy family where they collectively try to contribute towards running their house. All the standard tropes you would see like a single mother striving to stay above water, a rebellious teenager and her crush, an adolescent handling her bullies at school etc. While this is all well established, the mom's character is shown to be flip-flopping though the tone of the movie still continues to show her in a positive note. Instances like when the mom doesn't try to investigate much further into the money purse discovery, doesn't pay heed to the changes in Doris after her new ability and just pushes on to exploit it etc. With the eventual revelation about the spirit, having the Ouija board in the center of it doesn't make any sense. The acting is moderately good which has very minimal characters overall much like most other movies of this genre. Most of the scenes either happen indoors or at a school's entrance which means that the entire movie was shot in a shoe-string budget despite its period setting - considering this is observed only in retrospect shows the quality and it is worth to commend the production design of this movie. The atmosphere setup is one of the most important element in a horror movie which it gets right to most extent. But the overall quality of the story or the thrills plays the spoiler where the origin story is very under-cooked and full of holes leaving a lot of content that doesn't make sense. A serious evil doing mischievous things is what I can't comprehend in most horror movies and this movie isn't any different.Fumbles both on human and other aspect with a passable story and occasional thrill."
" This sequel strikes gold.
",-0.3612,0.9948,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"It's Halloween season and the big horror movie studio Blumhouse has released another film in their canon franchise with their famous business plan. That movie is 'Ouija: Origin of Evil', which is a prequel to 'Ouija' from 2014. I know. I get suspicious too when a studio wants to start telling prequel stories to the masses. Most of the time, they don't work, but Blumhouse and filmmaker Mike Flanagan (Oculus) really raised the bar with this prequel that is terrifying, fun, and connects the original film nicely, despite some silly problems here and there.Overall, the film works, has some great scares, some funny moments, and even has the characters doing and saying some smart things, which is usually not the case in these horror films. Needless to say, I kept the lights on at night after watching this prequel. Set almost fifty years prior to the events of 'Ouija', meaning this movie takes place in the heart of the 1960s with all of the excellent furniture, clothing, and hairdos – not to mention the great music. The Zander family is the main focus here with a young Doris Zander (Lulu Wilson) and teenage Paulina Zander (Annalise Basso) with their widowed mother Alice (Elizabeth Reaser), living in that beautiful home, reading people's palms and fortune telling. The family dynamic seems good and loving, despite the loss of their husband/father.A ouija board is purchased to help with the fortune telling business when all hell breaks loose. If you've seen the first film, you will know what is going to happen here, which the script and filmmaking perfectly captures all the horror you heard about in the first movie. If you haven't seen the original movie, then you're in for a thrill ride that will make the hairs stand on end throughout the film with all of its creepiness.Either way, I believe this horror film will do its job in scaring you, at least for a little while. There are some odds and ends that don't make sense here, and it seems like filmmaker Mike Flanagan wanted to incorporate 'The Exorcist' somehow in this film, because there are some shots and moments that were completely taken from 'The Exorcist', including the famous shot of the preacher (Henry Thomas, my man) walking up to the house and looking up upon it.The performances are decent and the scares are genuine. The time period really adds to the feel of the movie in a good way, in that it feels more organic, and there weren't any issues with social media or mobile phones. Even though there were some usual genre tropes used here, it all felt fresh for the most part and was quite enjoyable to watch. Doug Jones is billed in the film, and I'm sure you're able to pick out which character he plays, which as usual is excellent and scary-as-hell. For the Halloween season, this is the film to see.RECOMMENDED!"
" Ouija: Origin of jump scares
",-0.34,-0.9797,2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Usually when I watch a horror movie, I can remember some of the jump scares. Sometimes because I had so much tension built up before they happened or just that they were really scary and good so it is stuck in my head forever.This movie however had so many jump scares it got to the point it was just ridiculous. I mean towards the end it just became funny almost as you could predict every jump scare. Many of the jump scares are basically the actor just jumping in front of the camera with the face really close with a stupid looking cgi effect.Some of the jump scares were also more funny than scary. And the acting of the little kid are one of the worst I have ever seen: She is emotionless. I bet even if you have a demon inside of you, you should portray some emotions like hate or anger or spite... but nope... this little actor did not manage that.I have to rate this awful simply because the movie is not scary. It only relies on jump scares to ""scare"" you. It's not real fear you know."

Without giving too much away all i can say is that this installment is surprisingly good and even better than the original, its smart in using tactics and angles to creep you out! Strong story with good acting always elevates cinematic projects like this, but what truly did it for me is that it sort of defied some horror basics and played by the ""horror movie rules"" by adding a smart direction to it. Its an excellent horror film that does not rely on a heavy R rating and gore/violence to deliver chills, now that is smart. Do not watch this movie alone.Final grade, B+"

There are some gaping holes in the storyline and the acting isn't fantastic, especially when the boyfriend drops down hung from bedsheets out of nowhere and the reaction from all present is as if to carry on as if nothing happened. Goes for the snappy 'fright' loud noise moments all too often without delivering on a progressive storyline, could've been a lot better but if you're looking for something along the lines of insidious or the conjuring expect a lot of disappointment"

This second movie in a franchise (hopefully) surprises the original (which i liked overall, but not as much as this one by far) in every possible way. This is a first rate horror movie. I loved the ""70's style horror movie flick"" written all over this movie - this is clearly visible not only from the sets and the time in which action takes place, but also the movie making itself. Acting was good, especially by the two young leads. Writing was solid, directing was first rate. Overall, the first hour of ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" was pure 10/10 - it worked perfectly as a horror movie type drama, where all the chills aren't rushed and the movie was carefully constructed. Maybe the second half of this movie when the things that ""can't be explained"" a bit rashly started to be explained by the script and it lost a bit of that tension and terror of unknown. Nevertheless, this is a superb horror movie that first of all builds the story (and does not rush by doing it), introduces the characters that we start to care about (two young ladies of course) and goes for a wild climax which is good, but not as great as the first part of the movie. Two Thumbs Up for ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" nevertheless."

The IBDb rating was pretty low, the title is a bit cheesy, and the writers, directors and cast are not exactly A-listers. None of that mattered though as this one was actually pretty good.First off, the scenes were beautiful. It was like watching a warm sunset. In addition, the direction and camera angles really enhanced the suspense and intensity. The special effects were also top notch and at one point I was like, ""Whaaaat? That is cool"".I was pretty captivated throughout, although it did have it's clunky moments but not too many of them and they quickly worked their way out of them.The cast did a superb job with the young Lulu Wilson pretty much stealing the show. I'll most likely be seeing her again in my nightmares. Annalise Basso, Elizabeth Reaser and Henry Thomas also did an excellent job so I don't want to sell them short either.Overall this was a pleasant surprise with moments of nail-biting suspense.

" Good For About An Hour
",0.4404,-0.9911,2017-01-07 00:00:00,3,"I watched the original film feeling like I wanted to tear my eyes out. Then this prequel comes along. I click the play button and before my eyes I see something that looks like television show quality, a throw back to the old cult classics that I use to watch as a kid in the eighties. It was an interesting direction, but really didn't know what to make of it. I say to myself ""okay it's set in the past and we are about to embark on a journey"". All went well for about an hour, there were very little jump scares noises, if any, and only one stretchy CGI demon face(for the first hour or so). But the stretchy cheap CGI demon face was done in a way that is acceptable. There were very eerie moments when the camera would pan to the left or right catching a shadow figure in the background. But the good thing is there was no cliché jump scare sounds, it was left up to us as the viewer to deem the scene scary or not.I was actually commending the director for this old school style of horror story, no silly jump scares. But in and around the one hour mark or just a little after, all silliness broke loose. This movie now turned into jump scare central, all the gags were saved to spoil the end. It's like they didn't know where to go with this ending, or they ran out of money, and decided to make the last half hour or so an editing mess, full of unwanted scenes, and dialogue that people have seen over and over again.You can really tell when a production runs out of money these days, it had such a good back story, but instead of branching out on that story, they made it into a teenage horror drama-fest. They did this by throwing in scenes of other films we all know. This film started out good, it had a feel of a really good short story, and unfortunately that's all it was, because the last half hour was all pies and anchovies. Note to studios: Stretchy CGI demon faces are silly and just dumb, and not even teenage girls find them scary, they are a product of the YouTube generation, and it's been done to death, so please I beg you stop using CGI in horror, it doesn't belong in this genre!(or any other genre)"

" Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016)
",-0.6597,0.9883,2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"When I first heard about this sequel/prequel my initial thoughts were: ""Who the hell asked for this?"" The first Ouija was cookie cutter horror film. It use the device of a ouija board (and the mystique and eeriness of it) as a crutch for the thin, awfully written that followed. It was a completely forgettable experience, so one would wonder why the film series was brought up again. Its a good thing that first impressions are just what they are because this prequel is not bad at all.The film was in better hands when it was announced that Mike Flanagan would be directing but I was still mixed. Oculus was actually pretty great. A creative idea that was actually pretty emotional and investing. Flanagan's followup was the Netflix film Hush. I know a lot of people loved Hush but maybe these people don't watch movies often or are lenient to what they see on Netflix. Hush was terrible. I don't want to go into it here but maybe some other time I can explain how improbably dumb it really is. Anyways, this film is a prequel of sorts to the first and is based on a family who help people move on from their passed loved ones by staging seances. A ouija board causes dark spirits in the house to possess a young girl leading to trouble and at times, some wicked fun.The film is set in the 60s and you can immediately tell by the film style. The style is of a film you'd see from that era; they even used the old Universal Pictures logo at the start of the film. Its not just the post production editing of the film but the costume, music, and just all around aura is done very well. No one knows her well yet but Lulu Wilson made this film. She does a great job and there are a few moments (where the script was fantastic) and she was able to come off as unsettling, just from saying her lines. She is without a doubt the strongest point of the film.The film isn't without flaws. The third act isn't exactly fantastic as some questionable things happen and you scratch your head wondering if there could have been a better resolution. There definitely could have been. Also, the CG does look ropy at times but I think that can be forgettable as the film offers decent entertainment value. Here's a film that sacrifices scares for build up, good performances, and focus on the story of why spirits have possessed Doris and the circumstances surrounding whats going on. I can respect that.I'm usually extremely critical of horror films because these days so many films go for jump scares and have no substance. There are exceptions that are becoming smart, nostalgic, or reinventing the horror genre. I don't think there is anything innovative about Ouija: Origin of Evil but its a massive improvement over its predecessor and is a film has a good amount going for it to make for a good time.7/10"
" This prequel has no business being as good as it is.
",0.1779,-0.8761,2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"This prequel has no business being as good as it is. The first Ouija film came out in 2014 and quickly faded away into obscurity. So imagine my surprise when they decide to make a 'prequel' of all things. I hunch is that The Conjuring films have been pretty successful and they are set in the 70's, when things were a little creepier, no cell phones and genuine scary aesthetic. Imagine my surprise again when up and coming horror filmmakers Mike Flanagan was the man behind the camera. The underrated mirror horror flick Oculus and deaf home invasion flick Hush were two of his recent outings. Things were looking not too bad for this flick and to top it off, it received some pretty decent reviews. Alice and her two daughters run a scam business in which they ""speak to the dead"". The mother justifies this business by telling her youngest daughter, Doris, that it helps people move on and get closure. When her eldest, Lina, plays the new Ouija boardgames at a friends house, she tells her mother to incorporate it into her act. She does and things take a sinister turn when they scam becomes reality. It's hard to make a game board scary. The first film tried, failed and this one tries and succeeds for the most part. Any non-horror fan might balk at the idea that this film is good, but I consider this movie to be one of the most underrated flicks of the year. Flanagan knows how to build solid tension and he doesn't rely on cheap scares or an obscene amount of gore. This film has none of that. Careful framework and lighting is all he needs to create an unsettling atmosphere. Whenever someone decides to look through the ouija glass piece, you feel yourself tense up expecting something to happen. Kids in horror films are the go to for anything scary. Most movies tend to cast children horribly and they end of ruining the film. Doris, played by Lulu Wilson delivers an innocent and somewhat chilling performance as the youngest daughter. Her goodbye message to a young boy about what it feels like to be strangled to death is an excellent scene to send chills down your spine. No scary images, sounds or blood needed. Just a child delivering one monologue about suffocating you. Obviously the film is far from perfect, but it doesn't cater to the happy ending crowd either. It takes some chances and for the most part, lands them. I was surprised by how much I liked this film, which may be why the rating is higher than what others would tend to give a film like this. Had the first film never existed, this would be a bigger hit."
" Infinitely superior to the original
",0.7003,0.9842,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"I just went back and read my review for the original 'Ouija'. It was a fairly negative review overall and there was an interesting line in there about these movies being doomed before they even start making them because Ouija boards aren't scary. Step forward Mike Flanagan to prove me wrong. Flanagan is becoming a bit of a heavyweight in the horror industry with each of his films so far being very strong. Here, he does the near impossible and makes the a sequel (technically a prequel) infinitely stronger than the original was.There was a lot of great stuff here. Something I loved was that the jump scares were more about the imagery than just a loud noise. Typically these days jump scares take almost no skill at all to pull off because the damn noise that accompanies them is so loud that it wouldn't matter what happened on the screen. In 'Ouija: Origin of Evil' the scares are more about the brilliant visuals that are created throughout the film. They're the type that will stick with you afterwards and require a lot more skill to pull off.The writing is also a lot better this time around. The first one had some atrocious dialogue and incredibly stupid characters. This time there are genuinely fascinating plot points that give the film even more levels than just a horror film. The original also had an immensely weak opening scene. On this occasion the opening scene is one of the strongest in the whole film and even has its own mini-twist.The character of 'Doris' was the highlight of the whole experience. I was incredibly impressed with young Lulu Wilson's performance. Playing a regular character in a horror movie is easy, but playing a villainous character is not. She was brilliant and played a large part in making this film what it was. Altogether I really enjoyed 'Ouija: Origin of Evil'. In a world where good horror films are becoming rarer and rarer we have to stop and truly appreciate the great ones that do come along. This was certainly one of them. Keep churning out films please Mr Flanagan."
