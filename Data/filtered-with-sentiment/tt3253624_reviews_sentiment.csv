" Biased
",-0.2732,0.9798,2021-03-23 00:00:00,3,"If you're watching for entertainment purposes, it's enjoyable, if you're a Nirvana and Cobain fan, you'll notice fairly quickly, this is not an objective doc by any standard.The writing assessment - never mentions that Cobain changed his hand writing more than most of us change our underwear. His journals make this super evident. From Uppercase, lowercase, to cursive, he did not stick to one type ever.The dinner scene - It is well known Cobain had a huge arsenal of guns. Not just one, or two. Having a conversation pre suicide about the shotgun Love gifted him specifically, but none of the other guns he owned? Nah, never happened and that puts everything they say that follows into doubt.Skimming VERY quickly over Cobain's mental state - Grohl himself have made numerous statements in the Cobain Biography that Kurt would go from major highs, calling the band the best band ever, to major lows, referring to all their music as utter &*%. Kurt use to dress as a woman and request people to call him another name. He literally has a song, which is a true story btw, about living under a bridge. Cobain had many indications of Bipolar and depression. An old friend that said he looked happy? Yeah, so did Robin Williams.Cartoons & photos - Cobain referenced suicidal tendencies before, during and after the Love relationship. Drawings of hanging soldiers, photographs he takes pretend shooting himself with his guns, song lyrics, etc. Not mentioned or shown in doc.It could have been good, had it been objective and given a complete view of who Cobain was, and added their views and evidence (which is also a bit wish washy), it doesn't. The doc is biased and doesn't take a well rounded view of all the facts pertaining to the case. Worse still, it erased a major part of who Cobain was."
" It's official: Kurt was murdered
",-0.6597,0.938,2021-02-05 00:00:00,10,This confirms it for me. Courtney had Kurt murdered. The fact she has got away it for so long is galling. Tom Grant has tapes proving it. Kurt had his problems but he wasn't suicidal and he had so much more to do but she was his downfall. I can't listen to his music anymore thanks to her. Probably best I don't anyway because she gets all his royalties. God I miss the early nineties.
" I have a better understanding of the Trump cult with all these 10s
",0.4404,0.8051,2020-10-12 00:00:00,2,"Even the most ardent Courtney Love haters have to notice that this is based on the P.I.'s theory not facts. I'm fairly certain he made a nice profit. If you believe his theory you also have to believe that a heroin fueled Love was able to mastermind a murder, make it look like so much like a suicide that Seattle law enforcement with the eyes of the world on them couldn't find a shred of credible evidence AND have all this coincidence with the release of Live Through This."
" Raises some interesting questions that should rightly be answered
",0.4019,-0.7984,2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"Soaked in Bleach is an intriguing, if slightly meandering docudrama on the death of Kurt Cobain that is still to this day shrouded in mystery. For a direct to dvd documentary i remember hearing nothing about back in the day, especially one about a subject as TMZ as this, i was surprised at how good the film looked, how well interviews were together and how close to the facts it was.Though Soaked in Bleach comes in with a predisposition on what happened back in 1994, it puts it's case across rather well. The most insightful and interesting part of the whole documentary for me was how inept the investigation was by the Seattle police department into Cobain's death. They readily believed it to be a suicide based on tabloid news coverage alone, minus one forged missing persons form by Courtney Love, and if Soaked in Bleach is to be believed, conducted literally no investigation into the death and wrote it off as a suicide the same day they found the body.This fascinating insight and several more are what you will find in soaked in bleach, a remarkably decent examination of it's subject and one that's well worth a watch for Nirvana fans and true crime fans alike."
" What really happened?
",0.0,-0.4472,2020-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Did Courtney kill Kurt? Who really shot JFK? Did Neil Armstrong really land on the moon?
The conspiracies that won't die.
This film was so heavy-handed that it took me a couple of hours to get off of the ground just to write this. A narcissistic cop-turned-PI, who always wanted a movie written about his life, gets some time in the spotlight by being involved with a famous suicide, only to find his fame dwindle as the years go on. And then he found someone to listen.
This isn't a documentary. It's dramatizations surrounded by interviews. This is a documentary for the CSI generation; those who don't have the attention span for a real documentary or a realistic, balanced and unbiased view of Kurt Cobain toward the end of his life.
Are you interested in Kurt Cobain? Then watch Gus Van Sant's ""Last Days."" It's beautiful, it's poetic, and it's not officially about Kurt (because he knew Courtney would sue him because she sues everyone). Everyone is represented, even this self-important PI, Tom, who is portrayed much more favorably than he otherwise could have been (kind of a know-it-all blowhard, but not an idiot). Some of the best scenes on film are in that movie. Michael Pitt should have at least been nominated for best actor for it. Not everyone is Gus Van Sant (okay: no one is Gus Van Sant but Gus Van Sant), but it's crazy to me that someone could produce something like this after ""Last Days"". If this had come out after, then it would have been easily forgivable, but there's no reason for anything like this.
I mean, maybe you like being told what to think on every turn of events. Maybe you really hate Courtney Love. I mean, I'm not on her side: Courtney Love is a terrible musician and songwriter and seems like a horrible person. But there are lots of terrible people out there who are not murderers. But, if you really want to believe a self-loathing heroin addict, who hated the attention he got, had some complex conspiracy to murder him executed by other heroin addicts without being detected by the police, then go ahead. It doesn't change anything.
And watch ""Last Days."""
" Lies for $$$
",-0.4215,-0.7506,2020-03-06 00:00:00,1,"This ""documentry"" provides lie after lie, innacuracy after innacuracy. Leaving out the key evidence that proves suicide and editing interviewee's to manipulate the truth. Kurt didnt take a 3x lethal dose of heroin for addicts, the cadaveric spasm didnt take place. The list goes on and on."
" Coldblooded murder, pure and simple
",-0.6908,0.7049,2020-02-29 00:00:00,10,"This documentary is very well put together and based on pure facts.
The world needs to see this! It's unbelievable Courtney got away with this, she isn't a mastermind, this wasn't a higly thought out masterplan. It's all so clear cut and obvious and SHE STILL GOT AWAY WITH IT!! She's still succesful and still has millions of fans that believe and support her.. She needs to be in jail! This is maddening!"
" 10 times better than Montage of Heck
",0.4404,0.9136,2020-01-14 00:00:00,10,"Its 10 times better than ""Montage of Heck"" by far with true information. This production is definitely under rated. Hope it finds its value one day."
" Watch this with an open mind it'll open your eyes
",0.0,-0.679,2019-08-15 00:00:00,10,"This documentary will open your eyes to the truth. Poor Kurt was definitely murdered, his wife and friends were in on it. Courtney set it up, hired a detective to throw trail off her, had his friends turn on him for drugs esp dylan and courtneys ex. I wouldnt doubt courtney paid off Seattle police chief or detective on scene. How ironic is it he was cutting her out of his will and asking for divorce...then ends up dead..and with a 4ft long shotgun..cmon..and had his wallet next to him..a blind man could see he was murdered!"
" Interesting Doc
",0.4019,0.4927,2019-03-31 00:00:00,10,There's a lot of information in Soaked in Bleach which really jumps out at you and makes you think i really hope this case is looked at again
" So many obvious and unanswered questions surrounding Kurt Cobain's death.
",-0.5994,0.5255,2018-10-11 00:00:00,10,I find this movie fascinating! Courtney Love was basically a homeless youth living in the same area as me (Salem and Portland Oregon). She's about 5 years older than me. I lived in Salem and worked at Fairview training center down the road from Hillcrest training center when I was 19 to 24. It is totally believable that Courtney Love could be a murdering psychopath. Women with far less motive than her have killed husbands.
" I did a 180, and this film confirmed so much. Must see!!
",0.0,0.339,2018-08-01 00:00:00,10,"I didn't know much about Kurt Cobain because I never liked that type of music. Courtney I knew more from her interviews. Always thought that she was just getting a bad rap because of the misogyny in our culture. But after watching some interviews with Kurt, reading some documents on how he died, nothing made sense. I mean, parts of what the media are saying are laughable. It is clear he was murdered if you know anything about how heroin works or firing shotguns. After Googling to see if others were onto this, I came across the movie Soaked in Bleach! Yes, it confirmed all the suspicions I had and more. Especially haunting is hearing Coutney's own voice on tape. She is so clearly a sociopath, and I have gone from totally supporting her to a total 180 in knowing she had Kurt killed and paid a lot of people to help cover it up. I believe the truth will come out eventually. And what did she get for all that money? Sure, it gave her a career, but a brief one at that. Now, she is a rich, homely, drug addict with a washed up career whose face is falling apart from bad plastic surgery. Francis Bean will get all the money in the end, and hopefully with some support and counseling will be able to lead a healthy life. I bet deep down, Frances Bean knows Courtney Love did it too. Kurt seemed like a sensitive, decent bloke who was getting his life together, off the drugs, and rid of Courtney before she killed him and her former bandmate. Seems to be a pattern with Courtney. Maybe karma will give her some of her own medicine."
" Worst director of all time
",-0.6249,-0.9883,2018-05-05 00:00:00,1,"Just to make clear: Cobain is one of my favorite people i lived among in this planet. This documentary is so bad, is funny. Aesthetically it is awful, no taste at all like a cheap crime tv show, you must really lack talent to make something THAT bad, considering you have all of these exhibits (true of false) and still make this conservative, inhuman piece of work. Putting the horrible photography aside, putting the horrible acting (this is a mean person look the actor, he/she is trying so hard to show you that his/her character is so mean you would understand it even on mute) also aside, the ""director"" should be ashamed portraying Courtney Love as vicious by using cheap puritanical shots of ""people making out in the same room with her"" (evil duh?), ""her girlfriend touched her in a -probably- erotic way"" (a bisexual probably? What a nasty person, duh?), a junkie (as also Kurt,duh?). This is insulting at least and pure stupidity if the director took by the book the descriptions of Mr Grant - who is anyway focused in a purpose, find justice or cash a death, and, you know, i don't really care, because demonizing people through their weaknesses, habits, orientation and other paleolithic, human-hating point of views is pure TRASH and all of people made this should be ashamed.
Cobain would spit on this first, even murdered."
" If you have half a brain cell you will realise Kurt's death needs re-opening
",-0.5994,0.9581,2018-04-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the best docudrama's I have seen in a long time, totally unbiased and let's the viewer make up their own mind. For me the authorities must be plain stupid or they have a hidden agenda as for why the case isn't re-opened, it is plain for anyone with a functioning brain or basic intelligence that there are far too many loose ends to not reinvestigate, the head cop at the time was obviously a bad cop to not do basic things that any normal cop would do. Courtney Love is proven to be a liar and proven to send the investigator on a wild goose chase, the film let's the viewer make up their own minds as to why she would do this. More importantly why didn't the cops question Love more? If the investigators easily prove she's a liar why couldn't the cops do the same? Kurt's so called suicide has made the cops life easy, period. Oh and of course made Love a lot richer, apparently she owns Kurt's publishing rights and more, she's worth over $150 million. Kurt was going to divorce her and she would have had very little if he'd still been alive. Watch the movie and make up your own mind, either way it's a fantastic docudrama."
" Watch with an open mind
",0.0,-0.9869,2018-01-13 00:00:00,4,"If you know the story surrounding Kurt Cobain's death then there are no spoilers in this review.Documentaries are seen to be unembellished, an altruistic person(s) is trying to tell you a horrible truth based on factual evidence. However, ever since I watched Zeitgeist 10 years ago and subsequently discovered it contain very little factual knowledge. I have always been skeptical of documentaries. This one is no different.The first moments after watching this documentary I felt uneasy, like someone is pushing me just too hard in a certain direction. I couldn't fact check any content, and then I read Roger Ebert's review, '""it's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it."" And he was right. This film was done in a very odd way.You are subject to a dramatisation of events from Tom Grants memories. The character of Courtney is a stereotypical villain, no emotion, compassion or empathy. Constantly conniving and plotting. Tom, however, is represented as the selfless hero hell bent on getting to the truth. Regardless of the costs. It seems a bit 'panto' to be considered an accurate representation of character.The interviews with the experts also have a 'pantomime' feel. Shot in a room with a large glass roof with a storm raging outside, all that was missing was Courtney's cackle echoing in the distance.Many assertions are too woolly, seemingly contrived to give more weight to the writers beliefs. For example Kurt is described as non-suicidal, even happy. A trove of old friends are paraded in front of you to corroborate this, his depressive lyrics and song titles are put down to excessive fan analysis. I find this very hard to believe about a heroin addict who wanted a divorce and spent much of his time alone, he might not have been depressed, but happy?Factual evidence is presented but not fully analysed. We are told about Kurt's suicide note several times, it is analysed to see if it could have been forged and analysed linguistically to see if it makes sense. But at no point do we get to read what it actually says (and we get to read a lot of other things). Needless to say I have read it since, and it shows the thoughts of a depressed man, who by all accounts wants to die.By the end of the documentary I had one blindingly obvious question which seems to be ignored in the whole documentary. Why, if you were going to kill a heroin addict, would you give them an overdose of heroin AND shoot them in the head with a shotgun? Makes no sense. Its more risky, more likely to go wrong and leaves more questions to be asked by law enforcement.The documentary does do a good job of highlighting poor police work by the Seattle Police Department, but this does not mean Kurt Cobain was murdered.In summary the documentary lacked logic. The Director and Producers were clearly trying to sway audience opinions using cheap tactics and all in all it lessens the punch of some of the facts they do enlighten you with.
Be careful when watching this, it definitely needs to be taken with a pinch of salt."
