" Cringeworthy
",0.0,-0.5023,2021-04-03 00:00:00,1,"I watched this halfway through, hoping there would be some redeeming turn of the plot. But there is just one terrible steretype-reinforcing scene after the other. I cannot believe this was shot in 2015."
" The Lion King with Humans
",0.0,-0.8885,2021-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Eine sch칬ne Unterhaltung allerdings etwas zu lan g. Zudem werden einige Themen der Kolonialzeit sehr vereinfacht und oberfl칛chlich behandelt. Wer damit kein Problem hat, f칲r den ist der Film optimale Unterhaltung. Die Bilder sind einfach wundersch칬n gefilmt und die Dramatik in der ungleichen Liebesgeschichte intensiv. Es ist nicht umsonst Spaniens teuerster Film 2015. Ein bisschen wie der K칬nig der L칬wen mit Erwachsenen."
" A great Movie but not Perfect
",-0.35,-0.6921,2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this movie due to overall performances by the actors. Its a love story and the lead actors showed a real affection towards each other. You can see it in their eyes and expressions that they really love each other. The reason I cannot give it a 10 star is because it has some flaws that I would like to point out. They were living in the Africa for sometime peacefully as a couple, they should have shown what led Killian to leave Bisila behind in a hurry, was he being chased and attacked by a Mob? Then why they didnt meet each other at all?? Your love was true , you married her , you waited for her in Africa for 1 year to reunite but then you never return back or send visa/tickets for Bisila to join you. Instead you move on , marry someone else and have a child -_-
Secondly, you have stayed apart for so long, never contacted each other and after learning that Killian passed away, Bisila goed in the ocean and commit suicide, for what reason?? You were their on your own and raised your kids alone now you wanna die for someone who moved on and have no part in your life, that was not appropriate end to the movie.
One thing I was able to figure out after searching internet that Killian was not the father of Bisila's second child. That was because of Rape.
So thats my review of the movie. It is a good one and I can recommend people to watch it but its no 10/10."
" Much different from any romantic movie

Beautiful storyline and deeply moving.
Thak you so much for this film, I recommend it to EVERYONE."
" Embarrassing
",-0.3818,0.2382,2020-06-16 00:00:00,5,"Good, but not direct, a bit embarrasing. The novel is complete and sometimes you get confused with the different times that the history happens"

" Love Through Slavery
",-0.1531,0.699,2020-05-11 00:00:00,7,"As Clarence is going through her uncle's things, she finds a fragment of a letter written by someone close to her late father. She discovers things about her family's past that lead her back to Equatorial Guinea where it all began. Based on the novel by Luz Gab치s, Fernando Gonz치lez Molina's Palm Trees in the Snow (2015) invites viewers to reflect on colonial slavery through a story of unconditional love.
The setting at the beginning of this historical drama is Pasolobino, Spain in 2003. With the discovery of the letter, the clock turns back time to 1954 and the audience sees her family's history playing out with younger versions of her father, uncle, and Guinean natives. At this point in history, Spain had colonies in what is now Equatorial Guinea. Kilian, Clarence's uncle, has just started working in the family cocoa plantation in what used to be Fernando P칩, Spanish Guinea. Kilian falls in love with Bisila, a native of Fernando P칩 and one of the family's many slaves. When the political situation changes several years later, Kilian is forced to decide between his chosen family in Guinea and his home in Spain.
Through Kilian loving Bisila, the audience sees the cruelty of slavery. Typical punishments like beatings are shown on screen, as well as the harsher reality of rape and fractured relationships. The actors' performances in these scenes effectively convey the pain of this trauma, both physical and emotional, especially since Kilian intended to be friends with the natives. This is particularly true of Simon who vowed to never speak another word in Spanish after the colonists left.
Where the movie has its downfalls are in the Spanish characters. The majority of them are very set in their way of ""I'm Spanish, therefore, I am above you"". This mindset is solidified in characters like Clarence's uncle, whose dementia prevents him from acknowledging the ignorance in it. It is a downfall for this film because he is never able to come to terms with his past.
The merits outweigh the downfalls making this movie well worth watching. The acting and message both are powerful. While it's true that slavery and the related concepts of friendship and identity are at the forefront of the movie, a secondary theme worth noting is that love will prevail through time, distance, and injustice."
" Slowly worked but crafted well.
",0.3919,0.945,2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"It's a long film but sort of needs the time to get around all that goes on in the film.
Slowly worked and well crafted, it's not the same film as the English patient but certainly had that similar feel to it.
This film becomes hard to watch at times due to the hardened moments that we see unfold.
I didn't know anything about this film prior to just putting it on so it was a nice surprise in enjoy it."
" Finely produced masterpiece
",0.6249,0.992,2020-03-25 00:00:00,10,"I have seen many Mario Casas movies and it is really inspiring how he has transformed. From ""Three Steps Above Heaven"" to ""the Invisible Guest"", this journey is simply extraordinary, but with Mario's flawless acting, ""Palm Trees in the Snow"" is the best Spanish-language film I have ever seen.I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone, who likes historical dramas, based on real events from our past and with some fictional details.Scenes are breathtaking, featuring marvelous places from the Spanish mountains and Equatorial Guinea, Colors are beautiful, actors and actresses are acting so well, cinematography is above words, really finely produced masterpiece.To be simple, this is a must watch movie!"
" A wonderful movie 游뗵
",0.5719,0.8677,2020-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Palm Trees In The Snow is an extremely well made classic, wherein true love and passion of the central characters has been carefully woven around the last 10-15 years of Spanish colonisation of Bioko in Equatorial Guinea.It also showcases the selfless and relentless search of the main protagonist, in an absolutely foreign and unfriendly terrain, so that she can deliver justice and bring closure to her departed father and dementia suffering uncle.All the actors have worked very well. But Berta V치zquez as Bisilia simply stands out. She has displayed a myriad range of emotions with equal ease and conviction."
" Killian
",0.0,0.8553,2020-01-03 00:00:00,9,I loved the role of Mario Casas as Killian but I wish he'd played the role of old Killian himself!
" Gripping Spanish period drama
",0.0,0.4404,2019-09-10 00:00:00,9,"Any movie I can watch for 3hrs in Spanish, with Spanish subtitles, has to be good. This had me gripped from the start. The ending will stay with you long after the film concludes."
" Great Spanish film in this century.
",0.6249,0.836,2019-09-05 00:00:00,10,"Best Spanish film i have ever seen. You must be cry and wondered. I have no word to say about this film. Palm trees in the snow is a great film ,beautiful story , Actor actress . This Film remembered my past.
Everybody must see the film."
" Very interesting if not poignant drama...
",0.4576,-0.4601,2019-08-01 00:00:00,8,"My only criticism was the poor English dubbing of language, which unfortunately, became laughable at moments, truly damaging the effect...Otherwise? If you pay attention and follow the plot-line, very interesting absorbing romance/drama with historical context and interest."
" Heart warming story
",0.1531,0.9833,2019-07-11 00:00:00,6,"Beautiful locations, reassuring story line, brilliant actors, soothing soundtrack, wonderful cinematography, superb camera work, touching love story.Makes you believe on love and humanity once again, that spreads across colors, races, borders, riches.Only negatives are showing people of Guinea in a relatively backward color and custom, where as it might just be the opposite."
" Mixed feelings
",0.0,-0.7357,2019-06-18 00:00:00,6,I have mixed feelings about this movie. I love Spanish movies so when I first saw this I liked it but watching it now I realize it hasn't aged well. I feel like the nude scenes distract from the story and how ridiculous some of it is. The movie's about a woman named Clarence (Adriana Ugarte) who goes to the island Bioko which's part of Equatorial Guinea to find out more about her estranged father Jacobo (Alain Hern치ndez). Her father and his brother Kilian (Mario Casas) worked on a cocoa plantation owned by his Dad Anton (Emilio Guti칠rrez Caba). His dad is one of the many colonist during the time when it was known as Spanish Guinea. While working there Kilian writes in his journal given prior to his trip and falls in love with Basilia (Berta Vazquez).This leads to things getting complicated for the workers and the owners. I think the big problem is that it kind've glorifies colonialism. While it does show abuse of the workers and that not all of the colonists are evil no one really apologizes or reflects on the pain brought on to the natives. The acting is fine and the cinematography but the story's a little clunky and even insulting in some areas. A good example's a scene where this one character named Iniko initially distrust Clarence but then in the next scene they're on the beach having sex. Again I feel like that scene was there just to distract the viewer from the clunky plot. If you like spanish movies I guess you'll like this otherwise skip it.
" Moving and overlong melodrama in big budget with romances, emotion, thrills and exotic scenarios
",0.5859,0.9811,2019-06-16 00:00:00,7,"Intense drama plenty of thrills, emotion, romance with Amor Fou and soap opera. Set in 1953 it deals with a young man Killian, Mario Casas, living in the remote mountains of Huesca, he alongside his older sibling Jacobo, Alain Hernandez, undertaking a new life, and embarking on a dangerous journey to Ecuatorial Guinea where is working their father, Emilio Gutierrez Caba, on a cacao plantation and subsequentlly taking place the troubled days of Independence and triumph by dictator Macias . Many years later, after the death her daddy, a young Spanish girl, Adriana Ugarte, finds out some unanswered questions by discovering a mysterious letter. As she searches for the answers and travels Africa on a risked trip that takes her back to Fernando Poo . Meanwhile, there takes place an Independence War with turmoil, confrontation, rebellion from African natives against the Spanish, leading to fateful consequences.Dramatic movie concerning two brothers travel from Huesca which saw them to grow up to the exotic island of Fernando Poo where takes place several thrilling events, love stories and revolutionary upheaval. It packs a magnificent camera work, high production values, luxurious design, violent images and a lot of sex scenes, including intercourse on the beach. A lavish production with a deep criticism on Spanish colonialism of the fifties by using a great number of flashbacks and flashforwards. Average acting by Mario Casas as a young who never left the far mountains of Huesca and comes to Guinea to find knowledge, pain and maturity . Adriana Ugarte Is better than him as the young woman who unfolds secrets of her ascendants. Support cast is pretty good, such as Alain Hernandez, Macarena Garcia, Daniel Grao, Berta Vazquez, , Luis Callejo, Fernando Cayo, Djedje Apali, Petra Martinez, Celso Bugallo as an adult Killian and veteran incombustible Emilio Gutierrez Caba.It displays a sensitive and stirring musical score by Lucas Vidal. It contains a brilliant and colorful cinematography by Xavi Gimenez. Shot on location in Llanos del Hospital Huesca, Bahia Solano, Colombia and Palmas de Gran Canaria. The motion picture written
by Sergio G. Sanchez was well directed by Fernando Gonzalez Molina, but being extremely overlong, almost three hours . He has made some successful films as Brain drain, 3 steps above heaven, I want you and The invisible guardian. And he directed notorious Tv series as Paco's men, The boat, Luna el misterio de Calenda and a documentary, The best day of my life. Rating 7/10. Well worth watching."
" I would recommend this
",0.3612,0.765,2019-04-09 00:00:00,7,This was a beautiful shot film. There's a lot of love and a lot of sadness. It prove that. Caucasian race need to apologize to the black race. Your race brings death everywhere they go. The continent of Africa is beautiful.
" Surprisingly good!
",0.6588,0.9671,2019-03-19 00:00:00,7,"I didn't really want to watch this movie because i thought it would be the average romantic movie with an exotic setting.
But it's actually a good movie with interesting an likeable characters, and the spanish colonisation angle is treated with enough depth (mind you, it's not a documentary or a historical movie, so i am speaking comparatively).
There are some common tropes here and there, but overalli is a good and entertaining movie."
" Great Movie; English Dubbing HORRIBLE
",-0.0343,0.63,2019-01-19 00:00:00,7,"This is a great movie! However, I had to force myself to watch it until the end because of the English dubbing/voiceover did not align properly and match the characters emotions and etc. You have Africans depicting strong emotions but the dubbing is this monotoned all white American voice w/ no emotion. It doesn't match. Even the captioning was off. I would've preferred to watch the original version and select English captioning."
" Historical Fiction very Human
",0.0,0.9713,2019-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Had conflicting sentiments while watching this movie. I am very proud I can watch it in my house where I can stop and go and take on tangents to research an area of my cultural ascensencynof which I had very little knowledge. After finding out through multiple sources (stop the film 20 minutes into it) about Spanish Guinea and flipping out of my chair about how this Spanish colony had all but vanished from history books and few memories from my childhood I decided to swallow my tears (at times the film is quite blunt) and anger to see how far can I go with the story.
I am glad, very glad I watched it all the way. It puts the History and the Human passion in contrast and gives you (me) a sense of hope that in the mist of all the drama, there are souls and passion finding wamth among the desolation and transformation of a colony into its own legitimate independence. Well made, sourced and left me with a very heartfelt feeling. Bravo."
" Beautiful
",0.5994,-0.0971,2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,"It was a great movie, for those who are not sure if they should watch it or not, I truly recommend it."
" Hollywood should remake this but this is a nice epic movie
",0.5719,0.891,2018-11-30 00:00:00,9,Amazing movie.. Epic..acting is good.. Over all its a nice and nicely well made movie..
" This was special
",0.4019,0.4767,2018-06-27 00:00:00,9,"Powerful, tragic, beautiful, and it made me cry. I tell everyone about this movie and they all thank me afterwards"
" Cringeworthy with English dubbing
",0.0,-0.9803,2018-01-06 00:00:00,4,"I rarely cannot finish watching a movie, but finally gave up on this one with just 30 minutes left. The dubbing was dreadful, which had a negative impact on the acting performances, but the characters and narrative lacked depth and appealed to stereotypical typecasting of white males, particularly the lead character Killian, as victims of circumstance rather than perpetrators of evil in the history of colonialism; black women were portrayed as beautiful, oversexed seducers and black men mostly as stupid and violent. Rather than shedding light on the real history of Portuguese occupation of Guinea, it perpetrated stereotypes, including white women craving sex from dangerous, muscled, well-endowed black men. The main reason I watched the movie for as long as I did was the exceptional cinematography, which was breathtaking."
" I cried at the end
",-0.3818,0.9725,2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I've seen lately. Once again Molina has granted us such a pearl. I wish there were more movies like this one - showing the eternal values and true things in life. At the end only the simplest things matter - have you really loved, were you fateful, did you have dignity."
" I highly recommend this beautiful movie to every single one of you
",0.8293,-0.4649,2017-08-13 00:00:00,9,"I have watched many and many movies and not every movie can actually leave a big influence on me. This one did it. ""Palm trees in the snow"" (or as I prefer in Spanish ""Palmeras en la nieve"") is very deep, sad, interesting too. You have to concentrate a lot to understand everything you need to. The biggest shock for my brain was when the movie ended and 10 minutes later I just started crying and couldn't stop. It has many historical things happening besides the actual movie plot. It made me think about lives of those people in Africa, second half of the 20th century. I am quite sure it will make you too. Brought to life by phenomenal actors, it will leave a mark in your head, I know it. Highly recommending it to you."
" Fabulous!
",0.5707,0.9336,2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie. It has to be one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time. It was almost 3 hours but I could have watched another hour for sure. I am not a big fan of subtitles but this time they weren't a huge deal. I was so into the movie! I would highly recommend this fabulous movie.
" Palmeras en la Nieve: Highly Recommended
",0.2716,0.9422,2017-05-12 00:00:00,10,"The Cinematographic transposition of Luz Gab치s' (first) fine novel.It's a wonderful story, very well adapted for the screen by Sergio G. S치nchez (screenplay) and Fernando Gonz치lez Molina (Director).It's a great emotional tableau, dealing with Universal themes.So no matter what age, race or gender you are: you will surrender to the romantic charm of Equatorial Africa at the end of the Colonial Era."
