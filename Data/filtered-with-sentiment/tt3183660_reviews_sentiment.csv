" Reading the screenplay is more fun
",0.5563,-0.8756,2021-03-30 00:00:00,6,"My grandma got me a copy of the screenplay to this movie and I liked it a lot. I was really excited to watch Fantastic Beasts, but when I watched it I was kind of disappointed. They all say they are from America, but they all have British accents. That's kind of insulting. And it was really easy to guess what would happen(I mean i read the screenplay and all, but even my 6 year old brother could guess what would happen) The CGI didn't really improve from the harry potter movies. Kind of the same. But it still looks a little cool sometimes. This isn't a great movie, but at least it isn't boring. The main problem is that you don't have any feeling for it."
" A very good prequel
",0.4927,0.9144,2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,This is a solid addition to the Harry Potter saga we all love. Newt has an interesting story and the wizard world of the 1930s is just as fascinating. Nothing magnificent or special but the Harry Potter saga well love - this got me watching everything all over again.
" so unnecessary
",0.0,0.8924,2021-03-17 00:00:00,5,"This movie won't make sense if you're not a big Harry Potter fan, and if you are a big Harry Potter fan, the plot holes and additions will just irritate you. First of all, the story could have just been one movie, rather than 3? 4? 5? not sure exactly how many they're planning, but it's too many. Then you have the issue of casting. It might seem like a minor detail, but Johnny Depp is literally 30 years too old to play Grindelwald at this point in the timeline. It makes things confusing when this film attempts to weave its plot into the already established Harry Potter/Wizarding world history. This film relies on the worldbuilding of Harry Potter, but uproots the setting completely, so we are left with only a vague understanding of wizard life and politics in America. Some of the characters like Queenie and Jacob were interesting, but Newt was very one dimensional for a lead. I'm not going to keep watching this series."
" a good harry potter prequel
",0.4404,0.9611,2021-03-17 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic beast and where to find them is a great movie. amazing plot, the rising action is just the best i have ever seen in a movie so far. I recommend you watch this movie, 10 out of 10 for me."
" No story, What's the point of this movie? But CGI is quite good
",0.5704,0.8556,2021-03-15 00:00:00,5,"No story & too much CGI
I have to say that I am really disappointed of the movie as a whole. The Harry Potter movies are easily one of the best and most rewatchable movie franchises so far. And this movie is sadly nothing like the original HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the special effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue between the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional humorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just introduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would literally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn't Harry Potter become one? After all he fits the criteria).There was also way too much CGI in the movie. It became a real nuisance after a while. Especially because it wasn't even ""up to today's standards"".My final critique concerns the overall flair of the movie. It just didn't feel like it belongs to the magnum opus that is the HP movie franchise. And righteously so; why did they film it in NYC? The HP franchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I never really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it became very clear to me. You can't just change the location like this and expect the audience to embrace it. Sorry. What's next? Fantastic Beasts in Japan? No thanks. We already have that, it's called Kaiju."
" Not so fantastic
",-0.4838,0.8176,2021-02-17 00:00:00,1,"This was an interesting premise but ultimately felt like there was just too much going on, with way too much CGI. I didn't think much of the acting or the music either. The handful of references to the Harry Potter universe were amusing but that was about it."
" Spin-off I didn't wait for the main series
",0.0,0.9752,2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,"Spin-off I didn't wait for the main series. Having seen a trailer, I have understood that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is created first of all on new younger generation. It is some kind of first movie of the saga. Naturally this movie doesn't come within miles of any part of the original saga. He reminds the parody to the original more. But the parody has turned out good, first of all because all have missed the world created by Rowling. On the other hand it is the excellent family movie with excellent CGI. Initially I waited smaller from this spin-off."
" Unsurprisingly disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.0258,2021-01-19 00:00:00,1,"I am a big Harry Potter fan, books and movies. I wasn't expecting much of this movie and unfortunately I was right. I found it completely ""empty"". Don't know what else to say about it."

" Great Harry Potter fantasy
",0.6249,0.9168,2021-01-13 00:00:00,10,The dream comes true for Harry Potter fans. I loved the sense of wonder and creatures throughout the story. Really nice sceneries in New York with Art Deco stylings. Newt Scamander is well cast.
" Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them can be defined as an experience that cohesively fits into the universe created by J.K. Rowling
",0.6808,0.9975,2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"The story takes place in New York City in 1926, approximately 70 years before Harry Potter's journey. Fortunately, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a more adult work. After all, anyone who grew up with the franchise is now an adult today. But don't worry, there will be no lack of magic. The premise could not be simpler - and in fact it yields expendable and childlike scenes. But that's it, it's just the premise. The script, written by Rowling herself, is much more complex than that, inserting several layers, knowing how to insert new pieces in her large board, guaranteeing a totally new look from the viewer. As said before, the feeling is different from being in front of a Harry Potter film and much of this is also due to the way these creatures play an active role within the script, not just in a timely manner like the hippogriff in The Prisoner of Azkaban. The change of air, of course, already gives a new tone to the work.We see the magical universe of the United States being made and form in a magnificent way, with the right to president, congress and very different terms from which we have become accustomed, used in England. It is an excellent expansion of the magical world, in which for the first time we left that more restricted world of Harry Potter and started to realize that the magical world is present in the whole world, as well as in the world of non-magicians. Despite being in a world that shares practically the same rules, each witch society has its cultural differences (the American one is more conservative, in that it does not allow wizards to relate to non-wizards, for example, differently from British society).Leaving England and leaving for the USA offers us a totally different view of this world. Starting with the different laws in relation to non-majs, something that Scamander himself calls backward. It is quite curious, as it is a social / political posture that, on some levels, is similar to what Voldemort preaches, especially with regard to the loving involvement between the two groups. This question only guarantees greater depth to Rowling's creation, one point dialogues with the other, while the word ""bad blood"" (in addition to many other factors, of course), gains an even greater repulsion from the viewer / reader - see, we are speaking of a curse that reflects a position adopted seventy years before the events of A Pedra Filosofal, a gigantic backward conservatism.The interesting thing is the way the text deconstructs this archaic position taken by the Americans. Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) is the one who represents this evolution of thought. From the beginning she had already shown some hesitation in arresting Scamander, but she is in constant conflict between her duty and what she really wants to do. Her sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol), externalizes this internal conflict of the character - one is more restrained, while the other expresses her feelings clearly, acting as ideal female counterparts for Newt and Jacob. The beauty of this is that we do not need to hear this fact through some speech, but we see through Waterston's performance, who gives us a woman who is precisely in the encounter between the past and the future - she, more than anyone, represents the opening the mind to more progressive postures, something that is made clear by your willingness to save Credence and not simply kill him, especially in the final fight inside the subway.It is not that the work is absent from some slips, but its successes are able to stand out so much from the errors in such a way that we effectively feel as if we are facing something new. Although it takes place in the same universe, Fantastic Beasts does not have the same atmosphere as Harry Potter books or films, it manages to give us something totally new, familiar, but with its own identity, in such a way that we are hooked again into this universe of magic. and witchcraft. Rowling demonstrates her talent as a screenwriter by differentiating from the setting of her story, to the characters themselves, creating new personalities who do not simply copy those presented to us over the previous seven books. Above all, we are talking about a work that, despite being a spin-off, manages to stand on its own legs, allowing someone who has never seen or read anything from this mythology to fully enjoy the experience.The script also addresses topics such as fear of the unknown, repression, religious fanaticism and demonstrates an important concern with representativeness when placing a black woman in the position of president of the magical community. And that should be explored further in the next films. Here we have some ""reality clashes"" in moments of wonder. In one second we are amazed by that new face of the Wizarding World and in the other we see the characters having to deal with situations that evoke the worst prejudices and hate speech in our real world.Those who expect a production full of references to Harry Potter will be a little disappointed. But the truth is that it is good that Fantastic Animals is a work more closed in itself. There are quotes, of course, to characters like Dumbledore, to known spells, to famous surnames and to the relics of death, but nothing more than small tips or notes of what is yet to come. Rowling works well with these encounters and mismatches, uniting characters with specific functions to present a different, yet familiar, magical world.
Rowling's narrative mastery is also remarkable in the precise mix of enchantment and terror. The interesting thing is that the plot preferred not to explore Grindelwald's journey in search of a pure race: he decided to go the other way, showing the prejudice of the no-maj (the American denomination for ""muggles"") against the witch community. Prejudice becomes an essential part of the arc of Graves (Colin Farrell) and Credence (Ezra Miller), characters that underlie what we will see from now on.Yates proved to be the right choice for directing Fantastic Beasts. The director has matured a lot over the previous four features in the franchise and is already familiar with all the mythology created by Rowling. In addition, he was responsible for the most serious works of the boy who survived and knows how to print that more adult tone here. Not that children will not identify with the feature, but it is a more universal work in terms of age group, and it is not nearly as bureaucratic as Chris Columbus in The Philosopher's Stone or The Chamber of Secrets. The action scenes are able to deliver something that does not leave us completely confused and the director knows how to differentiate them throughout the film. Each brings us a different situation, allowing the narrative not to sound too repetitive. The presence of Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) is essential here as in the rest of the film. It acts as our new gateway, the non-magic that is recently introduced to all this magic. Our enchantment is ours, since we ourselves know new sides of this universe, from the new creatures, like the charismatic thief of objects that shine, to the terrifying Obscurus.Visually, the film is able to effectively present the contrast between Newt's journey and the destiny of the wizarding world, mixing scenes with lots of light and others that have a dense and gloomy atmosphere. This is very clear in the sequence where Jacob (Dan Fogler) walks inside Scamander's suitcase and walks through well-lit forests, meeting creatures with many colors, until he finds Obscurus, a beast of darkness. All this construction is very well accompanied by the melodies of James Newton Howard, who is able to resume all our fascination with magic through his songs with a more fantastic tone and inherits many of the great names, such as John Williams and Alexandre Desplat, who preceded him.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them can be defined as an experience that cohesively fits into the universe created by Rowling and also opens many doors, with the potential to captivate a new generation of fans who are discovering magic now, a definitive proof of how JK Rowling has control of this universe. More mundane than its predecessor Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them subtly presents the US context at the time, with the post-war, Prohibition and approaching financial crisis, to replace the hero's journey with a historical parallel that must reach World War II. The wizarding world has grown."

" One Big Merch Commercial

Quoting Newt Scamader, ""I've changed"", said awkwardly and flatly just as he spoke in the beginning.The characters are boring and the beasts are just random animals that we have in real life with an extra limb or something along those lines, but they don't touch on creatures that appear in the Potter books that are truly interesting. It should really be called ""Weird Beasts You've Never Heard Of and Why To Care About Them"". Even the niffler only appeared to be a ploy to sell stuffed animals and t-shirts with a cute thing on them.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them WISHES it was part of the Harry Potter series, but shares extremely little of the point and purpose. The only thing worse than the intent to try and keep Harry Potter relevant (which is completely unnecessary because Harry Potter is timeless) is the amount of VFX that weighs Fantastic Beasts down. The colour grading is fantastic but the overwhelming reliance on VFX makes it a truly ugly watch. Harry Potter has its share of VFX, I understand, but it wasn't completely reliant on it the way Fantastic Beasts is.I'm giving Fantastic Beasts a rating of 3 because it turned out to just be another greenscreen/soundstage AAA Hollywood blockbuster that cares very little for the original, lush lore of Rowling's original series and is irrelevant in its own unique way by ignoring all the deeply loved details of Harry Potter.Any true lover of the Harry Potter world will be able to see right through Fantastic Beasts guise for what it is, a really long commercial for off-brand Harry Potter products at your local Hot Topic"
" Creatures charming. Script largely unpleasant.

" Relatively decent Harry Potter flick
",0.0,0.9837,2020-11-23 00:00:00,6,"The first Fantastic beasts film is ok, nearing good status. It's an entertaining and well acted film with nice effects and movie sets but it's not very memorable and the plot is a touch of a letdown.Eddie Redmayne does a good job of playing Newt and his accompanying actors Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler all do well and have fairly interesting characters as well. Unfortunately I found quite a few of the side characters disappointing and the main villain played by Colin Farrell whilst well acted wasn't intimidating or threatening, more like a businessman.The plot's alright but nothing special, although it was fun to see all the magical animals and I did like the setting of some scenes, obviously a lot of effort went into making them. An annoying lack of action too.6/10: Good"

Its got all the special effects and a decent plot to go along with for the ride. You shouldn't be disappointed, but it won't be one of those movies you will rave about for the next 2 weeks either. Get the popcorn, candy & soda and enjoy.I start rating movies at a 5 and then go up or down from there. There is no such thing as a 10 and very hard to get to a 1. This movie is better than average but doesn't deliver enough on the plot to make it to a 7. FYI - the highest rated on IMDB is Shawshank Redemption at a 9.2."

He is a bit of an odd ball, caring more about the fantastical beasts that humans, which makes him not really fit in society.

The graphics are stunning and just Jacob Kowalski's face as he reacts to the magic around him sells the film"

" Amazing. Just amazing in every single way.
",0.8225,0.9984,2020-10-14 00:00:00,10,"There's a reason I have watched this 11 times (and counting!). This is an incredible movie.The effects are absolutely amazing. I think this movie has some of the best cinematography and effects I have ever seen. Being set in 1926, everything (costumes, sets, props) was so well done, something that is hard to perfect for a period piece. I also enjoyed the fact that the storyline wasn't overly complicated, but still rich enough to transport you inside the film. There's a perfect balance of having an original story and still tying into the original series, making this the best prequel I have seen to date. As a matter of fact I actually prefer this to the original Harry Potter series (please don't come at me!). It just feels like a completely different experience to the original Harry Potter series - while the original eight movies were more coming-of-age introductions to the Wizarding World, Fantastic Beasts feels like a slightly more in-depth dive where you got to see everything mentioned in the Harry Potter books and movies play into action.From the reviews I have read on this site, some of them seem to say that the movie is incredible, but the majority criticise it for (to mention just a few reasons) the 'fake-looking CGI', the 'overly complex plot line' and the 'bad acting'. I'd just like to say that I actually didn't mind the rather stylised CGI as opposed to it being 100% hyperrealistic, it gave a little more of a magical element to the story. I disagree with the claims that the characters and plot were under-developed - yes, there were a few too many side characters which got a touch confusing at times, but this can be explained away easily. And finally, I personally think that the cast was perfectly selected and they all fit their characters perfectly - I especially think that Eddie Redmayne was amazing as Newt Scamander.In conclusion, this is a must-watch if you liked the original Harry Potter films. There's an ideal mix of action, comedy and fantasy, and it's just such a well-made movie. The perfect movie to watch with friends.Simply incredible.-Sasha"

So many actors are like that.. they play themselves but can't ever really act when they're called to creat a character. He's way way overrated as an actor...but the other 3 were just 'fantastic'.
The movie had great scenes of the Beasts and such but there wasn't much of a plot. If it weren't for Redmayne I suspect this would have been a major flop. Kowalski too was just great... I hope the second movie has more 'teeth' to it. And Collin... I hope you've gone in another direction."

",0.6249,0.9877,2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,This review contains spoilers.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an entry into the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The movie is a prequel to the Harry Potter series and is about Newt Scamander as he searches for magical beasts in the United States. The movie stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander.The movie is primarily an exploration into the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The world is incredibly cool and visually impressive. The characters are all well written and distinct with Newt Scamander being the stand-out character. Eddie Redmayne does a good job portraying him and he is a unique protagonist for his eccentric ways. The U.S. wizarding world is also interesting as they are culturally different. It was fun to watch the world unfold on screen.The flaws I found with the movie is its plot. The villain was not at all engrossing. It became obvious that he was inside the Ministry of Magic. The movie could feel like the side characters are focused on too much. It felt like the movie was padding for time so it had to introduce side plots that had little relation to the main plot.I would recommend Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The movie is a great treat to watch.Grade: B
" Won't watch again

Giving the movie a 3 might be a bit unfair because the film still works and isn't necessarily a bad movie. I found that most characters were dull and uninteresting, the main character was ok and the muggle was kinda funny. The main girl that was with Newt I found annoying and hated every second she was on screen. The plot was everywhere and confusing. Comparing to Harry Potter is felt like a lot of magic and the way magic worse has been adjusted that it just didn't feel like the same world. The beasts and the whole losing and looking for them thing was boring and I feel like maybe if I was younger I'd enjoyed. This is not of a rant than a review. I just felt the movie betrayed the Harry Potter movies. And my last petty complaint is that the word (no mage) for muggles is annoying. Do not watch this movie and taint your liking of the Harry Potter world."

" It's Fine.
",0.2023,0.9956,2020-07-20 00:00:00,7,"I decided to revisit this film after a couple years. Let me say that the first time I watched it, I didn't like it. Upon the rewatch, I appreciate it more but still wouldn't consider it incredible.The Good:-Jacob Kowalski, Tina, and Percival Graves are standout characters that are compelling and enjoyable.-The ""beasts"" are amazingly creative and imaginative in the best way.-Set and costume design are really good. It was refreshing to see wizarding world characters in a different time period.The Okay:-The CGI is fine but with a franchise like this it could have been utilized better; a few times it feels overused...something that I can't say I ever felt while watching Harry Potter.-The plot is pretty straight forward, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but none of the desired twists land the way I think J.K. Rowling would have hoped considering she produces some really flooring plot twist moments in the original series.-The musical score is fine but not memorable.The Bad:-The pacing is rough in the film. There are some truly great moments but none of them seem to follow one another in succession. The first half of the film feels draggy.-It takes awhile to warm up to Newt as a character which isn't fantastic given that he is the lead. I understand he is supposed to be socially awkward but for the first two thirds of the film he mostly feels bland and you don't really care about him all that much.I think a key question when judging prequels is, although the story is linked to a successful property does it do enough to merit its own existence; can it stand on its own two feet without pandering or fan service moments. I believe Fantastic Beasts is able to be its own thing without elbowing the audience in the ribs about how it is connected to Harry Potter. If this were the very first wizarding world film ever it wouldn't be a knock out of the park but it would be enough to spark questions and spawn a sequel, which I guess means it does its job as an intro film well, albeit imperfectly."

" Without a charismatic lead, good characters or a good plot, its much weaker than the worst of the Harry Potter films.
",-0.8959,0.994,2020-06-26 00:00:00,5,"The Harry Potter universe has become one of the most lucrative and remarkable cinematic phenomena we know. Personally, I am one of many teenagers who read all the books and saw all the films but I was afraid when I heard about the idea of making this film. The environment is very different from what we saw in Harry Potter and, if it weren't for the mention of several elements we saw in previous films, the link would be very small. Accentuating the differences is the fact that this film takes place between World Wars and has New York as its setting.The idea for this film came from the small book ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", and it follows the adventures of their fictional author, Newt Scamander. He goes to New York with a suitcase of little monsters, some of them escape and their eagerness to recapture them puts the city in an uproar and concerns the magical authorities. However, some incidents are attributed to Scamander's animals, who refute responsibilities and end up engaged in an effort to discover what powerful evil being has caused them.The story, dark and mysterious, manages to keep our interest but the prestige of Harry Potter universe and our willingness to see how it all will end helped a lot. In fact, now we can check all its problems, which make it more boring than the worst of Harry Potter films: it takes a long time to develop and the story, initially confusing, turns out to be illogical and underdeveloped. Another problem is their poorly developed and generally one-dimensional characters. Scamander may be nerdy but he lacks charisma and leadership. The Goldstein witches goes from naive to stubborn. Credence looks like a man with a traumatic depression and Kowalski is just an idiotic ""muggle"".David Yates did a good job. I am convinced that he was decisive in preventing this film from being a fiasco. In fact, with all the problems, the overall performance of the cast, mostly little known to me, is naturally affected and only the hand of a skilled director could help them. Despite being a good actor, Eddie Redmayne does not perform miracles and is far from his best. Dan Fogler managed to be more interesting and charismatic than he, in the same proportion that he knew how to be funny and to captivate public's sympathy. Alison Sudol also captures our sympathy by giving her character a candid and sweet aura, but she is so sugary and stupid that I wanted to hit her with a chair. Another actor able of becoming sympathetic was Ezra Miller, but I think he didn't have enough material to develop his character beyond anger and a depressive cry. Katherine Waterston was uninteresting. Colin Farrell is somber but doesn't seem to know what he's doing. Carmen Ejogo is hateful. Worse than she, Samantha Morton seems to have been inspired by the wicked witch of the fairy tales. We also have the additions of Ron Perlman, unrecognizable but impeccable, and Johnny Depp, who does nothing more than an irrelevant and uninteresting cameo.Technically, this is a very visual film, thanks to tons of very high quality CGI, as we would expect. Its an expensive film, a super-production where green screen was the key. As it should be, the film is loaded with magical creatures that we have never seen before and each one is more incredible than the other. I especially liked the niffler, which looks like a friendly kleptomaniac platypus. Cinematography is characterized by good colors, a misty but pleasant environment, good use of light and dark and very clear footage. To add aesthetic quality, we have the charm of the Thirties, the golden decade for New York. Few decades have given us so much charm and style: magnificent cars, clothes and props that are still in fashion today and an incredible urban landscape, where there is no lack of fog and rain. For a moment, I almost felt like I was in a gangster movie, just missing the jazz background. The soundtrack, by James Newton Howard, is good and epic, but it is not surprising for those who has seen Harry Potter.Although the film exudes style, it lacks content, good characters and a strong and charismatic lead. Anyway, it achieved a feat that even Harry Potter, who broke box office records, managed to achieve: finally the franchise won an Oscar, for Best Costume Design, which in fact was deserved."

The movies could not been done better, no matter how many times a watched them, they dont lose any of its magic.This boring and confusing movie does not have any magic to begin with, the story is really confusing, the script is laughable in very bad way and for me the main hero is one of the most unsympathetic characters...Voldemort have better charisma than this dude.The world of Harry Potter deserves other stories, something like this but for real this time...Please miss Rowling, you had your fun."

For over a year I had a countdown app to keep of how many days were left until the 18th. But, after having read cursed child and being disappointed with how she continued the series, I was cautious about how she would illustrate the past. But Fantastic Beasts did the very opposite of disappoint. It was better than I could have ever dreamed and it's a shame that we now have to wait two years for the next one. Even if I wasn't a fan of Harry Potter I would still love it (though a lot of it would go over my head) Every fan NEEDS to see this movie asap."

I enjoy the new characters and their performances quite a lot but the film comes with problems to. My problem with this film is how uneven the storyline is and it doesn't know what it wants to be. One moment of the film will be focusing on the cute fantastic beasts but then the film switches tones to talk about child abuse. Overall it's an enjoyable film with problematic storytelling.
" Good addition to the franchise
",0.4404,0.765,2020-06-02 00:00:00,7,This film is a welcome extension to the Harry Potter series. It retains its core but also has lots of new settings and characters.

" Fantastic Films And Where To Find Them. Right Here.
",0.5574,0.9982,2020-06-01 00:00:00,9,"Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is a young British wizard who comes to 1920s New York to save numerous endangered magical creatures, who are under threat from other wizards, as well as from normal people. Along with two witches, Tina (Katherine Waterston), her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) and a muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), they race around New York and its hidden world of witchcraft in an effort to save as many magical creatures as possible and to defeat the menacing creature which wreaks havoc on New York's streets.Now, I'm not one of those people who avidly followed the Harry Potter films, although I did enjoy the ones I saw, so I came with a certain sense of expectation to 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them'. I like Eddie Redmayne and I'm happy to put my faith in J.K.Rowling to enchant me with her imagination, so my confidence was high that I would enjoy the film. And I was right. It's a superb romp through a magical world that the child in all of us really hopes exists and wishes we could be a part of.Right from the off, an auspicious start evokes a sense of wonder and foreboding, where anything is possible. Redmayne's Newt Scamander takes a little getting used to and I'd be interested to know why they decided to play him in a shy, socially awkward way. It certainly makes a change from having an overtly confident hero, but J.K. Rowling obviously has form with creating a geeky hero. Katherine Waterston's Tina is welcome as a love interest for Newt and Dan Fogle's Jacob Kowalski gives the audience a mirror image as to what it would be like to be a muggle in this magical kingdom. Good performances by both, particularly Fogle.Interestingly, they tease a potential love interest for Jacob with Tina's sister Queenie, a witch, which inverts the usual situation of the normal, everyday girl with the otherworldly male. This time it's the everyday guy and a beautiful witch, making a nice change so hopefully it's developed in later films (and perhaps other writers take note for their works).'Fantastic Beasts' moves along at a fair old pace but at no point leaves you feeling left behind. At two hours twelve minutes, it is just the right length, ending on several positive notes and leaving you wanting more. I know a second film has been released and apparently three more are in the pipeline so, hopefully, there's plenty more to come.It would be nice to see more of the Macusa wizards and witches in future films. They play a small, but important, role in this film and I think there's room there to develop a few of them into more prominent characters.Overall, it's hard to find fault with 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them'. You leave the film on a high, re-energized, and with all the magical possibilities flying around your head. Basically, you feel like a child again."
" Not As Fascinating As Harry Potter

" Write to Gu Yi
",0.0,-0.1614,2020-05-19 00:00:00,8,"The film runs through a contradictory concept of whether to follow the laws of nature or break the laws of nature. The so-called following is to accept one's own destiny. Paralyzed means paralyzed, and when the hand is abandoned, it is abandoned. Breaking the laws means changing the laws of the world. But the change is temporary, and the final outcome remains the same, just a matter of time.
Gu Yi's character feels like a human God, guarding the earth, and the rebellious disciples and followers are like Satan and other fallen angels who have been thrown into hell. As the truth was revealed, Gu Yi was not a god and had no eternal power. She also let herself live by the power of darkness.
Gu Yi used the power of darkness to fight against darkness and maintain the balance of the earth. In other words, darkness is the destination, struggle and existence of everything, but the faint fire in the darkness is fleeting.
Including the last male host, it also used Dormam's power beyond time and space to be qualified to negotiate with Dormam and protect the earth.
People will disappear after all, as will the earth, even if they are not controlled by Dormam. Compared to Gu Yi's covering up the truth, I prefer Baguio in Zhuxian, frank and open, although he is a cult, but never hides himself. Finally, he used the power of evil to protect his favorite person.
Gu Yi is also, in order to protect the most important things, do not hesitate to resort to darkness. The last words she said touched me very much:I am very nostalgic for this second alive.
No matter how powerful it is, it is still fragile, and it will still be afraid of losing the beauty of this world. After all, death and darkness are eternal. But I cherish this second, this second at the moment, a second in the future, and countless seconds of good memories in the past. Although it is fleeting and has disappeared, I can't hold it and I can't have it.
But as long as I remember, it is eternal in my heart.
If everything good is just a dream, I hope never to wake up."

" Movie compared to harry potter
",0.0,0.9937,2020-05-18 00:00:00,5,"I know, i can't compare the two different movie trilogy. But let me please because a lot of thing remind me a little to the harry potter movies. What i find unfortunately is that the feeling i get with the movie fantastic beast is nothing compared to harry potter.In harry potter you see a boy growing up. First you get to know the caracter before you're thrown in the deep with all the magic. You first get to know the caracters and the then you get to appreciate the surroundings where harry potter takes place (it takes at least an hour before the introduced everything). What i want to say is that these movies take everything slow. And thats where i fell in love with. The movies built on each other.All the slow getting to know the caracters and surroundings and then introducing the storyline is gone withe the movies of the fantastic beast. I miss the good musical effects and a person to fall in love with and follow the story of. You have newt. But instead of liking the person, he irritates me. I don't connect to the caracter because they didn't give me time to. (My opinion don't know if anyone else has the same) Im watching action that takes place but see no things that really matter. There is a storyline but its not important to me because i have no one i can relate to.I really hope the make more movies. (Because i want to know where this is going). The caracter credence barebone i do find intresting. I hope they make newt a little more interesting.

I felt the plot was a bit too simple to be perfect. The more positive sides of the film was that it was set in the world of Harry Potter, had some cool displays of magic, great action in the latter stages of the movie and I really liked the scene where the Muggle police got involved.

" Still don't see the appeal
",0.0,0.9972,2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Written by JK Rowling and directed by David Yates, Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them is film set in the Harry Potter universe and serves as a spinoff prequel to said universe.Let me start off by saying that I am not a die-hard HP fan. I've seen each and every one of the movies, but have hardly read any of the books; long story short though, I had a friend from elementary school and he was literally obsessed with the HP franchise, but I've not heard from or spoken to him since then. With that said, the HP franchise does in fact hold a place in my childhood. I've played two of the video games, that being Quidditch World Cup and The Prizoner of Azkaban, so there's that.That being said, I don't recall how exactly I felt about there being a direct spinoff of said franchise. But what I do know is that, upon my first time watching it, I wanted simply to be entertained. Unfortunately, that was not the case; at least, not at first. Upon my second viewing, my opinion on it soon changed. Upon my third viewing though, that soon began to where off.Now with all of that out of the way, do I think this is a good movie? The short answer is not really. Did I at least enjoy it? The short answer is ... kinda.Here are the things that I liked:The scenes with the Niffler - All I can really say is that that little creature was the best character in the entire movie.Dan Fogler as Jacob - When I first read about Foglar being cast in this film, I was pretty psyched. But after watching it the first time, I found myself to be pretty underwhelmed. It seemed to me that the man was pretty much type-cast as the dimwitted comic-relief-side-kick. But because of that, I was apparently oblivious to the performance that was given by the actor. I mean, when the script doesn't require him to look and act like a buffoon, Foglar seemed to have been giving the character more emotional depth than said script had called for.The makeup and costume designs looked spot-on, that's all I have to say about that.Now here are the things that I didn't like:The writing - I have to be honest and say that the story and plot-structure in this could not have been any clunkier in this.The main story focuses on Newt Scamander trying to retrieve each and every one of the titular beasts that he accidentally unleashed while in the city of New York.There are at least two subplots: one involving a troubled young boy is abused by his adopted stepmother and turns out to be more powerful than meets the eye, and the other involving a wealthy family of some king.This was J.K. Rowling's first time as a screenwriter and boy did it show; well not so much show as it did tell most of the time. This film was littered with dull exposition.And I'm not exaggerating as one of the characters literally spells out that the term ""no-maj"" is used to referrer to people who are 'non magic.' I mean seriously Rowling, you came up with the term ""muggle"" when referring to English people who are non-magic, but thinking of a word for the 'Americans' was apparently too difficult?The direction - I know I'm not the only one thinking this because I've read other reviews complaining about how grey and gloomy this film looked for most of the time.Yes, I completely agree, but must also mention how inconsistent the tone itself came across as. Within every twenty seconds, it would shift from being light-hearted and humorous to being dark and depressing a moment later.Last but certainly not least is the CGI. I could not sanction how cheap the special effects looked in this. I mean, when Newt shows Jacop the creatures for the first time, the movie tries to convince us audience that it is a whimsical scene. But honestly, I found it really hard to grasp as the creatures looked too distractingly fake.Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the big twist. When I first watched that scene alone, I was like ""What ...? Um ... okay then.""All in all, Fantastic Beasts was hyped by critics as a fun magical spinoff of the Harry Potter franchise. It was magical, but only by design, and it was barely fun to say the least. With all that said, I'm rating it 5.2/10."
" Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them

When the music comes to mind, there is a tearful feeling.The protagonist is constantly changing shapes, flying pastries, automatically stirring hot cocoa, and wiping his wand to restore everything to the beginning. Familiar lines: Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Muggle (called ""Maji"" in New York, It means ordinary people who do n't understand magic), everything seems to suggest to me that the magic world is back, as if it is within reach.They are so vivid, they are so specific, they should be like this.Innate, incomparable.Touching and memories are constantly intertwined in the movie watching, after all, no tears of excitement are left. Weeping because of joy, it has disappeared invisible in great satisfaction. What more can I ask, that magical world is still, always there, right in my heart, right beside me, and never left.Always!A friend asked, is the movie good-looking? To Hami, he is unbeatable.

" Magic continues
",0.0,0.9991,2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"So the 2016 Fantasy, adventure movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", which is a Prequel to Harry Potter films Directed by Davis Yates. This stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, a guy who is looking through old New York City many years before harry potter story, and he is looking for various creatures that has escaped from his magical suitcase. I myself am also a very huge Harry Potter fan since my childhood. And I enjoyed all Harry Potter movies too. Not only the movies but also the books as well. Fantastic Beasts is also written by J.K Rowling and once again she has shown herself to be one of the most imaginative writers working today. You can't stop admiring her creativity as you see the movie. I love all the creature designs, just like all the harry potter films Fantastic Beasts also has able to live up to everyone's expectations. What really I liked about the movie, was the way it was constructed. Action sequences and special effects are stunning. Setting up the main characters is also interesting. One other important thing to notice here is that Fantastic Beasts doesn't rely on Harry Potter films. Of course it's in the same universe, but you can't say that it's just a prototype of Harry Potter movies. It has a completely different taste. This movie stands on its own. It is something fresh, something new, something appreciable, and something definitely to be praised.
Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander is amazing in the movie. He is very likable and extremely charming. Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, who is a non magical normal person; also known as muggle. He kind of caught up in this whole journey unintentionally. He really added a lot in this movie like lot of humors, lot of funny moments. Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein also looks to be the perfect choice for her character. She is investigating the things that are going on in the New York City. She has done an incredible job. I especially liked Colin Farrell playing the villain character here. Who finally turns out to be none other but Johnny Depp. That finale scene of Jonny Deep is really cool and it looks awesome when it comes to the screen. Ezra Millar performed as required. His character is very dark, very powerful and also very horrible. A lot of stuffs are going on in this movie at the same time. This movie literally gave a perfect platform for many future projects. It's an extremely entertaining film; it is amazing and fun to watch at any time. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is without a doubt the best. You kind of get nostalgic when the modified version of old Harry Potter music comes in the movie at several parts.
Thanks for reading guys."

There have been so many great recent films (In order of disappearance, Intouchables, Death at a Funeral) that have been turned into substandard murrican versions that those of us in what is actually often referred to as ROW (rest of world) are a bit fed up. So J K Rowling gets all CGI-d up and Eddie Redmayne is roped in to play the blithering, Hugh Grant style English chap. Lots of crashy bashy chase scenes and none of the subtleties of the Harry Potter movies. Good if you cant sleep though."

" Surprisingly fun ""Potter"" spin-off
",0.6705,0.9966,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I didn't see this in theaters because I have not liked Eddie Redmayne in previous works. To me, he was always a little bit too over-the-top. So I was a bit skeptical about this. Not to mention, I've frankly had enough of Harry Potter. I love it, but there is such a thing as too much. Especially when this movie was very obviously a blatant cashgrab. But after everyone telling me how good it was, I decided to at least rent it. I'm actually glad I did. I went in with my expectations low. I wasn't determined to hate it, I just thought at the most it would be OK. It was actually quite good. Not just as a Harry Potter spin-off, but just as a fantasy movie alone. And to my surprise, Eddie Redmayne was actually enjoyable. He was fun and quirky, while not being over-the-top. I'm actually nominating him as a contender to replace Peter Capaldi on ""Doctor Who"" when this season is done. Even if you've never seen a Harry Potter movie you'll enjoy this, since it's not really connected to the other films for the most part. Will you get more out of it if you have? Yes, but only because of small references here and there that basically say ""Hey, we're in the same universe."" I enjoyed the differences in the magical world culture between England and the US. In England, non-wizards are called ""Muggles."" In the US they're called ""No-Maj's."" (As in ""No-Magic."") And there's a lot of school pride/rivalry between whether Hogwarts or the US equivalent Livermorny is better. Nice nod to the previous works. Apparently we're supposed to get 5 of these things, but honestly I don't see how. It works pretty well as one film, and is pretty self-contained. There's no big reveal or cliffhanger to set up the next movie. To be honest, I'm not even sure how it could continue but I'm excited to see how.

" An adolescent tone ruined interesting ideas
",-0.1027,0.9745,2020-02-06 00:00:00,5,"What I mean is that the adventurer tone of the original movies was perfect for the characters. Unwise kids fascinated and scared, reacting to the unknown world. That's fun to watch and the naïve kids discovering how the world works is a blast and believable family entertainment. To me, doing the same thing with adults is often a terrible decision. It could be good but it's harder to pull off. When the characters and overall story are introduced in the first 40 something minutes, the new ideas for this saga feel fresh and interesting (wizards against humans conflict, prejudice, wizards in opposition of how to face their problem with the humans, etc.), but around that time, the ""adventure tone"" takes over the movie, with ""sweet"" and ""scary"" set pieces ala Harry Potter but again, with 30 years old in the places of the kids. The kid friendly tone felt, to me, forced and kind of ridiculous and unbelievable. The jokes; the ""fantastic beasts"" introduced; the relationships formed by the characters; felt more appropriated for younger audiences or characters. The 4 leads were basically 4 clichés walking. Reacting exactly in the most generic ways to everything. The villains are done better, but they have little screen time.The visual effects were kind of weak for the most part, although they really delivered in the third act. The score was fine, but it wasn't especially good. The acting was fine too, with only Fogler making a 100% cliché of a character tolerable. A character that could've been pretty annoying in other hands. In the end, it just didn't work for me and if this is the tone the saga is going to go for, it would probably not make me fall in love like the original."
" Before Harry Potter...
",0.0,0.9602,2020-02-04 00:00:00,7,"First of all, I have to say this: J.K. Rowling is a GENIUS. She's one of the few genius storytellers that the world should have more of. She's one of the few storytellers who created an entire universe, like J.R.R. Tolkien with Lord of the Rings or George R. R. Martin with Game of Thrones. And now, after her enormous success with Harry Potter, she writes a spin-off based off of a textbook that belonged to Harry Potter in his first year at Hogwarts: ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" by Newt Scamander. It takes place in 1920's New York, 70 years before Harry went to school. The visual effects of the film certainly displayed the production budget of $180 million. The money was definitely on the screen. I went to see this movie in Harry Potter apparel, complete with a Deathly Hallows necklace, expecting it to expand on the Harry Potter universe and when I came out, I was slightly disappointed. I felt like it didn't really expand on the universe and instead aimed to be its own film, which in a way is good. Don't get me wrong; it still was wonderfully whimsical, but I feel like it just didn't have that much to offer. Because of that and also its slightly incoherent and confusing story, I'm giving this film a 7/10."
" Completely independent from the Harry Potter saga with a single small connection to put them in the same universe.
",0.0,0.8882,2020-01-29 00:00:00,6,"Because of the fact that I've only watched the Harry Potter saga and not read the books, I was completely unaware of the fact that this book was written by J.K. a long time ago as part of the Potter Universe. Nonetheless, I was pretty impressed by the imagination behind the looks of the creatures and overall how the city and everything looked, suggesting that the ideas were taken from the book of course. However, even tho the visuals were outstanding throughout the whole movie, especially in the climax, I was underwhelmed by the main character and his stiffness, boring nature and irritable tone of speaking which could not be heard even when I turned up the volume on my TV way higher. The supporting characters were also pretty pale, aside from Dan Fogler as Jacob who was an outstanding supportive role. The plot is simple, but engaging, even tho it can be pretty slow for some viewers. The villain played by Collin Farrel was also dissapointing, I guess his personality did not fit the character's shoes and that is why he was not the person to be chosen for the role in my eyes. All in all, 6/10"

" Average fantasy flick for die-hard fans of the Harry Potter universe
",0.0,0.1787,2020-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is for die-hard fans of the Harry Potter universe only. The movie has a lack of interesting characters, plodding length and weak plot that make it hard to sit through. Especially the first hour is a lengthy tale without a proper story line that mostly focuses on mild slapstick humour.However, the film is saved by its creative universe, excellent special effects and of course the numerous intriguing beasts discovered throughout the movie. The second half of the movie quickens up the pace, becomes more sinister and ends on a high note in form of an epic battle.This movie never comes close to even the worst movies or novels of the Harry Potter franchise and is simply stated an average fantasy film. The hype around this film and its sequels is exaggerated and the cinematic Harry Potter universe should have concluded with one single movie about the seventh novel ten years ago. You can watch this movie if you are an avid fantasy movie fan but anyone else can ignore this start of a new series."
" Where was the fantastic?
",0.5574,0.9459,2020-01-08 00:00:00,3,"I found this film to be poorly considered and altogether inadequate in almost every aspect of filmmaking.Acting. Casting. Direction. Writing. (A lot on the writing front.) Production standard. Production design.Premise. Characters. Plot. Narrative.Derivative and imaginatively deficient would be a good summation of the films creative writing.Stolid and slow is how I would describe 'Fantastic Beasts' as a filmed production.Disappointed is how I would describe myself.The writing is a strange derivative of the dynamic from the TV show 'Dr Who' and the world building premise of the 'Men in Black' films.Our protagonist is an out of place loner weirdo with a mission of good; a case bigger on the inside than the outside, accompanied by a companion, some local allies and a novelty creature. Dr Who already does this. Almost every episode.The world building/premise is a reusing of the 'Men in Black' organisation concept....even in its appearance let alone it's story writing function.Characters seem to function in a film time and space that is extremely plastic, flexible and whimsical.....frequently entering stage left when the script requires their presence regardless of whether there is any consistent reality, from what has been shown previously, to justify this.The most interesting character and characterization is of a cgi Ron Pearlman who appears in just one scene. Everyone else is bland and repetitive from innumerable films that we've already seen.The direction is overwhelmed by the special effects requirements whenever dealing with action sequences or larger set pieces and undersold by inadequate writing during more character focused smaller scale scenes.Production design and standards produce the most bland and boring portrayal of historical New York that I've ever seen depicted. The reading room of a public library would have more life to it. Frankly this extends to interior as well as exterior scenes. There is almost never any interest provided by the environment of the films happenings.Overblown cgi special effects complete the sorry tale.I rate 3/10 and I could only recommend this to people who are gluttons for anything Harry Potter esque. For everyone else there are much better things of this ilk to watch."

",0.3214,0.4264,2019-11-22 00:00:00,6,"I don't mean to disrespect Rowling fans, but one must look at it objectively and realize that, although the CGI in the movie could be viewed as convincing, it was sometimes purposeless.
Nevertheless, my score isn't meant to reflect the demographic this movie hoped to reach, but rather a view that spans into the totality of films.
Does it deserve 7 stars? No. Just look at the scene where the black prison guard speaks in a completely stereotypical manner, almost forced, whereas it seemed that the magic society had transcended ethnic differences which would cause these cultural aspects to develop in the muggle world.
After all, isn't the witch and wizard society born from the Salem witch trials (as explained by Hermione in HP2 or 3)? And not only that, but how little dimension do the characters having shown so little from their past?
In conclusion, and although I haven't read the book, I don't think this movie adapted fully to it, or if it did, the book fell short of the level of detail the HP series offered. Moreover, there was simply too much CGI."
" Impressive visuals don't make up for a weak story
",0.1027,0.9458,2019-10-29 00:00:00,5,"I've never been a fan of J.K. Rowling or her work and 'Fantastic Beasts' did little to convert me. Though I understood the appeal, the 'Harry Potter' series was never my thing and I always thought the films prioritised style and visuals over substance.'Fantastic Beasts' is no different in that respect. Only this time, the plot is significantly weaker and the characters far less engaging. It's clear where the budget went - visually 'Fantastic Beasts' is very impressive and it's easy to see why this film would appeal to younger viewers.As far as the story is concerned though, it leaves a lot to be desired and certainly doesn't justify the long running time. In contrast to 'Potter', it's also rather forgettable and I doubt I'd be able to recall any of the characters - or the plot for that matter - in a few years time."
" unfortunately.... It's very very boring....
",0.0,0.9891,2019-10-28 00:00:00,2,"Sadly, what could have been a colorful fun-filled romp through New York, meeting endearing creatures and characters and learning a motivational tale that gets us feeling good and ready to face the world,
turned out to be a slow-motion yawn-fest with one-dimensional stilted stone-faced cookie-cutter characters who spend most of the film dopily staring at each other or not communicating well, a tired plot tactic that is extremely annoying especially when the characters are supposedly clever. There is one story line where they attempt to state a moral, but it falls very flat.We end up not caring much about the characters because they have zero personality and we never learn Who What Why Where. The ""story"" rarely makes sense or is coherent and spends more time on evil than overcoming or resilience. A few attempts at humor go crude rather than clever. There is a bit of life about 3/4ths through, but other than that, just hit fast-forward.It's a prime example of why we don't go to the theatres any more. If a show ends up being boring or not-as-advertised, we won't have wasted time and money on it and we can fast-forward/rewind/pause/closed caption/.... all the good stuff ... as well as the great feeling of tossing it the bin if it ends up being trash. Such a shame. With the resources this group of film-makers has, everything they do should make sense and be beautiful and praise-worthy and a boon to humanity. CGI is not needed to achieve this, but a good coherent pro-peace story with characters that we care about is.Very grateful that they attempted to keep it PG and to use a bit of clever vocabulary. Enjoyed the beasts, real and doughy. They should have been the focus of the film. Over all, we were left grateful it was finally over and headed out to do something interesting and worthwhile."

However, I've never been so disappointment.
Well, except for Emma Watson in Harry Potter. She was always guaranteed to be unimpressive.I feel no connection nor empathy towards majority of these characters.
Katherine Waterston's performance of Tina is BEYOND annoying. She is so painful it psychically makes me cringe. Words cannot not describe my distaste for her. Her constant sad face brings the whole tone of the movie down.
Ezra Miller does no better. His demeanour although warranted by his treatment is lacking in believability of his portrayal.
Now Colin, as much as I like him as an actor. His character is completely disjointed. I know he is meant to be but I feel it's poorly written.Let's not start on Eddie. I don't have the strength to write forever on how disappointing he is. He brings very little and continues the trend throughout.The only saving grace is Jacob played beautifully by Dan Fogler.

" From Jk Rowling's wizarding world
",0.2263,0.9982,2019-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Back in 2011 when the epic Harry Potter saga ended I was simultaneously sad and happy; sad because my favorite franchise had ended and happy because it ended in such a beautiful way that tears came down. So you can believe my excitement for this was through the roof, and while I enjoyed Fantastic Beasts I found it to be somewhat overhyped. By no means is the film bad per sa, but the film lacks the magic that the original Harry Potter films had.First off, the acting here is spectacular. It's easily the best part of the film as were introduced into one of the finest creations of J.K. Rowling's mind, Newt Scamander. Eddie Redmayne is excellent and charismatic as the titular character is awesome to watch and he truly gives off this weird and somewhat socially awkward fella who needs his creatures. Katherine Waterston is very groovy (see what I did there) and plays along side Redmayne very well. The characters of Queenie and Kowalski are both good comedic reliefs and have great chemistry, not only with each other, but the entire cast.Directed by David Yates, he once again finds himself in the ""Wizarding World"" and while he does a fine job I would've liked to see someone new take their hand in this franchise. I do have to say that the score in the film brings me back to the early Potter films so bravo to the team for that. While the film itself looks good and has some great effects it suffered from an overwhelming and abundance of CGI. I was really really hoping it wouldn't be, but the sad truth is the CGI takes away from the beauty of some scenes and takes you out of the film as a whole completely.My real complaints of the film come from its villains. Colin Farrell is severely underused which is a shame as he is so good in the film andAlso Ezra Miller's performance is pretty bad. I get what they were going for but in the end it didn't work at all. The film may have its ups and downs, but overall Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a wonderful expansion of J.K. Rowling's ""Wizarding World"" that strives off its fun and light-heartedness and it's great performances."
" It ultimately tries too hard at being another Harry Potter
",-0.1027,0.9994,2019-08-24 00:00:00,6,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) - (M)
Tony Saad - Saturday, 19 January, 2019(STAR), (STAR), (1/2 STAR)Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them aimed to capitalise on the enduring popularity of the Harry Potter series, being the first feature spin-off film of the famous stories. Directed by David Yates, who directed the last four Harry Potter feature films, collaborated with J.K. Rowling -the author of the books, in her screenwriting debut- to create a product stuffed with clever CGI tricks and lots of allusions to the original series. While it does try to live up to its original series, it still leaves quite a lot to be desired. Still, it is not a terrible movie, in fact; I enjoyed it very much, but it sadly does not introduce anything new or memorable to the franchise, and is littered with all sorts of plot-holes.The film is set in 1926, some 60 years before Harry Potter rose. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), is a British wizard, who arrives in New York with his magical suitcase filled with... well, Fantastic Beasts! However, he bumps into Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) a no-maj (or muggle in the states), who mixes up his suitcase for Newt's, and some of the beasts escape. They both end up in the company of Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a former Auror and grounded witch for the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), and her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol, in her feature film debut). The race is on to find the beasts before they cause any trouble, while keeping the wizarding world away from the prying eyes of our world in the 20s. Yes, in 1920s New York, wizards and witches were persecuted by no-majs and lived in hiding from them.Now, this should make for a thrilling epic magical adventure, but when the whole story revolves around some beasts escaping from a suitcase, you know you're off to a weak start. To up the ante and increase the already low stakes, Rowling and Yates also included a subplot; a destructive phenomenon known as a Obscurus is on the loose, and Grindlewald (Johnny Depp), a notorious criminal, is a suspect.Personally, I do not see how this 'subplot' in anyway relates to finding Newt's beasts, as it never disturbs the flow of the main plot. What was Grindlewald's relationship with the Obscurus? What exactly was he trying to achieve? Was there something I must've overlooked -if there was, then I should know-? Or did Grindlewald like causing trouble for a hobby? He absolutely plays no real role in undermining Newt and his companions on their search for the beasts. And even then, why would Grindlewald even infiltrate MACUSA? Nobody knows. I don't know. J.K. Rowling doesn't know. Hey! Not even the man himself knows. It really was just a waste of Depp's unique talents.And that's why I liked lord Voldemort more than Grindlewald. His intentions are clear, and he plays a direct role in Harry's adventures, yet remaining in the shadows in the first half of the series, only slowly revealing himself in the fourth instalment.The award for the least necessary character in the film goes to (Drumroll please) ... Credence (Ezra Miller)! Yes. Credence is this abused and over-emotional kid who (Spoiler alert) ends up being the Obscurial that was terrorising New York. By the way, I do not mean harm to the actor; he did try hard. Still, like Grindlewald, Credence plays almost no role in Newt's search for his beasts, and somehow has got this strange link to the main antagonist that is too ambiguous for me to understand.But the characters in Fantastic Beasts are not all terrible, and some are even enjoyable. Dan Fogler's role as Jabob Kowalski was a good comic relief in the film. That said, I think if Kowalski did not bump into Newt, then he would've been of no use. But what Kowalski lacks in purpose, he makes up with his warm and entertaining personality and ability to engage with the audience even in tough situations.No film made in the last 20 years would be complete without some sort of romance. Enter Queenie, Tina's big-hearted legilimens sister who becomes attracted to Kowalski. Alison Sudol is a charming actress, and took off to a very good start in the feature film industry. Unfortunately, Queenie is just there for show, and that's a great shame. She had a lot of potential that could've been fulfilled in the film, but it never ends up being that way. When she senses that Tina and Newt are in mortal danger, she and Kowalski go searching for them. Except, Newt had a 'Pickett', a sort of mythical cricket that came out of the wizard's pockets to pick his cuffs and allow him to save Tina and himself, making Queenie and Kowalski panic for nothing.Speaking of Newt and Tina, they are both very compelling characters, but I found Tina to be a little bit dry early on the film. This is the first time I see Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterston respectively on screen, and they have both impressed me. They may not be as memorable as Harry, Ron and Hermione, but their collected and complex personalities make them more exciting than most of the other characters.The point was; there were too many characters and plot-holes for Fantastic Beasts to make sense. It is trying to be the new Harry Potter, going as far as to include the famous character's jingle at the very start. But what this film lacks in stakes, it makes up in sheer dazzling magic.Fantastic Beasts is a visually satisfying film which manages to closely emulate the magic duels of the original Harry Potter series. Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (Sherlock Holmes, 2009) presented the most tense and action-packed moments beautifully, almost reminding me of some scenes from Sherlock Holmes, which he filmed. His techniques are backed up through use of CGI that's so effective I was -I must admit- fooled into believing the beasts were actually real. Even then, projection alone does not make a film. If the story department had worked more closely with Rousselot, it would've been possible that the projection would be even more impressive.The highlight of the entire feature is the brilliant costuming. Really, I was mesmerised by Newt's suit, as it helped reiterate the character's veteran personality searching for, and rescuing beasts around the world. I must admit that New York, along with every other location including Newt's amazing suitcase, look so real to me. Seriously, everything was well built and placed, and looked as though we were really living in 1926. The Model Ts, the small shops, the metro in New York etc. all appear like they're taken from their original locations and used on set. I can say that Fantastic Beasts looks and feels so much more aesthetically pleasing than the original Harry Potter series.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them tries to imitate its original, by adding fantastic wizard fights and focussing on the aesthetics. But it ultimately tries too hard at being another Harry Potter. The characters lack the complexity of their original counterparts. I think Rowling and Yates were focusing more on making sure here were hidden information for the next few instalments than actually making a product that clearly had something to say. But the film does excel in showcasing the artistic creativities of the decoration and costumes department, and has made the original Harry Potter series a bit of justice to be fair.© Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Film Review, 2019.

Sometimes the best thing to do is watch and enjoy the shows main stream Christians tell you not to watch.The movie magic really delivers to us New York of 1926. That is a huge fascination to me and captures my attention above all else, through the whole movie.From the start of the early introduction a Muggle as a main character (Mary Lou) gets my heroic, defensive sentiment up. Must be from watching all those Harry Potter movies.Newt Scamander to me is a supper hero veterinarian. Having someone who loves and protects wild animals, as the lead character of the movie; really makes you take his side, no matter what. This is by far the greatest and best movie Eddie Redmayne stars in; to date.This movie does what all the Harry Potter movies do; makes you see that even in the witchcraft world there are good and bad. The fact that there is a immense thrust of pure chivalry from Newt Scamander; in both movies, makes this movie, give you that emotional all over feeling, we all watch movies for."

" I liked it
",0.4215,0.9941,2019-05-26 00:00:00,6,"I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world.For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure.The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch.However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest.Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!"
" One of those films where you're not routing for the characters, you're pleading for it to end.
",0.0,-0.8884,2019-05-21 00:00:00,5,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Admittedly, I wasn't expecting a great film in the first place. But, I did expect to have a watchable film as good as the last 5 Harry Potters. Those David Yates films were always poor, but they had Rowling's genius story. I'm shocked that she wrote this.
I just can't get over how dull it was."
" Fantastic beasts and the where to find them
",0.5574,0.9975,2019-05-21 00:00:00,9,"I must admit at the very beginning, I'm one of those adults who bought the small booklet, and even enjoyed it. I always appreciate when an author creates an entire world in which his/her story takes place, very few compare with the totality of the world created by JK Rowling. So no wonder that the full story of Newt Scamander has already existed in her mind, when she wrote his textbook for the Hogwarts' students and all the rest of us. But this was written from the very start as a movie, and in my mind is the fruit of the creative partnership she had formed with David Yates, who directed the final three installments (4 actually) of the Harry Potter saga.The result is both a visual marvel, a heartwarming story, and a tale of fantasy, action and suspense. Another part of Rowling's magic is the amazing characters she creates. She created here four wonderful leads, that gave room to some wonderful acting performances: Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, and the most surprising of all Dan Fogler, with whom I was already familiar as a voice actor (Mars Needs Moms) and he proves, that a good voice actor, is a good actor. One more special mention must go for Ezra Miller, who's so superb as Credence, that he almost spoils the surprise at the end of the film.Bottom line, not really a prequel, but a wonderful independent story that happens to fit into the same universe where Harry Potter exists. Don't worry, there's room there for much more."
" Amazing! I really love this movie
",0.862,0.9812,2019-05-13 00:00:00,9,"This is the ninth film of the Harry Potter Universe (wow, can you imagine that?), and actually this is the first time we are watching something from the magical world without worrying about whether the story of the movie is the same or not with the book. Because there is no book published before. In Harry Potter's story it was slightly mentioned that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is one of Harry Potter's guide books at Hogwarts. Its contents are about the guidelines for the first year of the students, written by Newt Scamander. Kind of mini encyclopaedias. There is a list of supernatural animals complete with their descriptions and classifications according to the Ministry of Magic.The story opens with the tension that hit the magical World in 1926. The Black Witch's Gellert Grindelwald is becoming a fugitive worldwide. Many mysterious accidents in the world No-Maj (term for Muggle in America), which is suspected to be a witch deed. This could lead to a war with No-Maj. Newt Scamander a witch and zoologist, saves a variety of magical animals in his little suitcase. Inadvertently, the suitcase was carried away by a No-Maj named Jacob Kowalski (and Fogler) so that some animals loose and rampant in New York city. And that is the most interesting part of this film. Newt's suitcase is fill with many unique animals, include Niffler, a kind of platypus that hobbies collecting sparkling objects; Bow truckle, a kind of living branch that likes to be stuck in a shirt; Demiguise, a kind of monkey that can appear invisible; Erumpent some sort of hybrid elephant-hippo; Occamy, the snake that ""fills the space""; Swooping Evil, which is a kind of bird and many more. Each scene that showcases them, always steals attention, whether it's when Niffler is theft at a jeweller, Erumpent is messing up at the zoo for wanting to mate or Thunderbird that's simply majestic. The space inside Newt's suitcase is so broad, each animal has its own ecosystem in it.All the characters, including the non-human ones, are fascinating and interesting. Every one of them has another big story behind, and of that, I am sure, we are going find out more in the next movies. And I think J.K. Rowling made the right decision by choosing Eddie Redmayne in the lead role. The Oscar-winning actor successfully conjure Newt as a natural and loveable figure. Newt's daily look awkward and nerdy, but turned radiant when taking care of his beloved animals. The comedy actor, and Fogler as Jacob really animate the atmosphere with the face of his selfie that looks at the action of the Wizards. Jacob's expression of screaming shock or laughing off, manages to make our stomachs shaken. Katherine Waterston is also very fitting as Tina, a strong self-willed woman - reminiscent of Hermione's figure. Tina is in stark contrast to her sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol), a sweet Legilimens magician, but not excessive. Another actor who deserves a thumbs up here is Ezra Miller as the leader of Second Salemers, a pale and gloomy ruler of Credence. Despite not many dialogues, Ezra's acting was able to make the fur stand as a mysterious, depressed young man holding his emotional overflow.Fantastic Beasts uses more modern CGI than the last film Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011). Unique monsters are very pampering the eyes of the audience. The fight scene is not so much and because almost everyone is an advanced witch, Fantastic Beasts barely offers any meaningful tension. But it still mesmerizing with the effects of black magic that we've never seen before.If you guys confess to be a Potterhead, then you should watch this movie. This movie will invite you to explore the history of the Magic World long before the trio Harry-Ron-Hermione begins. How the basics of the Magic World was created and then presented in the Harry Potter series. Invites us back to the magical world that used to hypnotize us.Well if not a fan of Harry Potter, how? Still have to watch this movie because they managed to build a new world-but-old. We don't have to watch the eight Harry Potter movies, or read the seven novels to appreciate and understand the story. This is an independent story that can be enjoyed even by people who do not know anything about Harry Potter."
" The most entertaining of the Wizarding World!
",0.54,0.9982,2019-05-05 00:00:00,4,"Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them (2016) is directed by David Yates, who directed most movies of the Harry Potter franchise from the Order of the Phoenix. The screenplay was written by J.K Rowling, which I had the book and I read the whole screenplay. It was the first time J.K Rowling wrote a screenplay. I really enjoyed Fantastic Beasts because the magical creatures were so creatively created.
Eddie Redmayne took the role of Newt Scamander, a magizoologist who went to New York to send his Thunderbird Frank there. Redmayne was fantastic being this character, he had to keep his beasts a secret so nobody would know. There was Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, a No-Maj (or Muggle in British English) who acted like an audience, he asked other characterss what was going on and they told not only him but also the audiences. I also liked Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein, she acted well and Colin Farrell as Percival Graves, who was actually a disguise. Graves was actually one of the most powerful wizards in the Wizarding World Gellert Grindelwald played by one of our favorite actors, Johnny Depp. His villainous acting was a bit weak and needed to be a little stronger and a darker character. His disguise acting was okay but when he was Grindelwald, he wasn't really in his dark characters but he was okay when he blew away 5 Aurors at the beginning.
This was about Newt going to NYC to.... I said it. Then some creature escaped from his suitcase. The creatures were really creative created by awesome CGI like The Niffler, Occamy, Erumpent, Swooping Evil,... They were like real and we wanted this universe to be real but it's not real. Dammit! I love all the creature designs, they're really cool! And David Yates had proved that he's the director who understood more about the Wizarding World more than others. This movie doesn't rely on a previous movie but set up itself. I mean this isn't a reboot and they did a really good job at creating the Fantastic Beasts series in the Harry Potter Universe. I love a lot of things about this movie, the creatures (they're adorable) (I wish there was a Hippogriff).
There's also one thing I liked about the movie: the original score. It was scored by James Newton Howard. The beginning theme was so satisfying that I couldn't take my ears off. Such a good soundtrack to listen to! I am looking forward to hear more of him.
I really loved Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them. It was such a good movie and it's one of the bests of the Harry Potter franchise. There's a lot of fun and you get to see a lot of magical things audiences wanted to see. Such an entertaining movie!Points: 7.9/10"
" Eddie Redmayne in his element
",0.0,0.9717,2019-04-27 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic Beasts is a fun start to a series set in a world we love. The film however does not rely on the premade world but instead chooses to place us in a new one. Our main character is already well developed and well acted from the start and I would think it would be difficult to develop Newt much further. I am happy to say however that we really get to see Newt's motives regarding not politics but instead the well-being of his animals. Kowalski is funny and an overall pleasant sidekick, especially when it comes to magic. Sadly the bigger plot points involving credence fall flat and Percival is not a very deep villain."

" J.K. Rowling stupefies again
",0.0,0.9661,2019-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Certainly, I can say that I grew up on Harry Potter movies tagging along with their adventures and maturing. When the end credits of the last chapter hit the screen the feeling of a loss overwhelmed and the thought of the end snuck from behind stabbing treacherously in the back. But out of the blue we get a new look at the beloved universe that might send back the vibes of joy and amazement of the unknown.Without a doubt the idea of seeing Harry Potter was in my head in the beginning but as soon as we were introduced to the main character by Eddie Redmayne, it was long gone. This chap steals you from the mere start with an incredible humbleness that hides the wit of a thousand sages and so many things up his sleeve that would make David Copperfield disappear in tears.Through a thick forest of cuteness we are introduced to the creatures never seen before. Every each of them possesses a particular set of skills that makes the desire to see more as ravaging as the fire feasting on the stack of hay. The ways in which characters are presented might be tricky and cramped but the result is really appealing to the eye.The highlight for me was the journey to the Terra Incognita of the wizard world - United States, but who am I to judge all the previous parts were mainly focusing indoors of Hogwarts. Anyhow the outside world with its own rules, unlimited possibilities and an enormous responsibility to hide the magic takes its toll by completely consuming you.The relationships between characters are extremely weird and as always things are moving only when they need, almost by a swing of a wand but in this case - a swing of a writer's pen. The reveals are not that impressive but still the action around completes the gaps caused by the dialogs.Stashing the wand into the pocket I would say that the journey back to the land of wizards gave the excitement that I was expecting and provided with a warm and cozy feeling of having miracles around. I highly recommend watching it and not less eagerly holding my almost exploding patience to watch a second part."
" Solid Spin Off
",0.1531,0.999,2019-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic Beasts is a spinoff of Harry Potter, in a universe now known as the Wizarding World. The Harry Potter series has a huge amount of content beside the story of the title character and his friends, namely, the fascinating and developed world it's set it. With a whole world of wizards that has existed within our own, there's a whole host of different options to explore this world. It begins with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the story of Newt Scamander, a British wizard who comes to America in search of a Thunderbird in Arizona but is stuck in New York after his beasts are let loose in the city. It follows him on his misadventures as he finds his loose creatures, which leads into some much bigger problems.What's interesting about this movie is that we see how the Wizarding World works aside from life at Hogwarts and in the Ministry of Magic. By having it set in America, neither of those things have a strong presence in the movie, although they are, along with Dumbledore, name dropped in the movie. Here we have MAGUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America) serving in the place of the Ministry of Magic. It focuses on the grown-up Wizarding World, as opposed to seeing the school of magic. Because of that, it still feels like the world of Harry Potter, albeit from a much different angle. The setting of New York City in the 1920s was done very well, from the excellent costume design to the look and feel of the city and its buildings. Additionally, you have the MAGUSA and some other magical places that have the same magic as the Ministry of Magic and Diagon Alley, but with a much different aesthetic. This movie succeeds because it's not a Harry Potter movie, it's a movie set in the Wizarding World. The beasts are, well, fantastic. One of the movie's biggest strengths is that the creatures of this world are spectacular beings, as one would indicate given the title. They give off that sense of wonder and mystery that the Wizarding World has succeeded in.The characters, on the other hand, aren't as interesting as they were before. Newt is played pretty well by Eddie Redmayne, but his character isn't particularly interesting. What he does is more interesting than he himself. This is, however, movie number one in the series, so give it time. Tina is in the same boat, but the audience can relate to her and her struggles. Jacob is a comic relief, and a pretty good one at that. The jokes about him being a muggle (or no-maj, apparently) entering the wizarding world is relatable, because that's how someone would act if they stumbled into this world. Speaking of, there's the whole ordeal with the Second Salem people. The whole anti-wizard part was interesting to think about from the idea of having this be what would happen if there really was an underground world of magic users. Credence was pretty cool, although that treads into spoiler territory. The ending was kind of dumb, though.Fantastic Beasts is a solid spin-off. It also gets credit because in an age where many sequels and prequels, like Force Awakens and Jurassic World, are essentially carbon copies of the originals. This could easily have been about little Newt going off to Hogwarts like in Sorcerer's Stone. It explores the world more thoroughly, which is its best aspect. It really isn't as good as most of the main Harry Potter movies, but it's a solid movie in its own right. But as the first movie in the series, it did what it had to. It gave us a good time, and left us interested in what's to come."

" Plot? What plot?
",0.0,0.9532,2019-04-01 00:00:00,4,"Being the big Harry Potter fan that I am, I was really looking forward to this. However, I was immensely disappointed. There's really not much plot happening in this, and it's very obviously a cash-grab riding on the coat-tails of the rest of the series to get it anywhere. But then again, the writers did basically take what was essentially a Zoo Book of magical animals and tried to turn it into a movie. This was basically the whole movie: ""Oh look, a magical beast that escaped is over there. Lets go catch it. Look, there's another one. Lets catch. Look, another one. Lets catch it. By the way, there's some wizard kid over there who's getting abused and might be dangers. Oh look, another beast is over there. Lets go catch it."" That's pretty much the whole movie.Ok, so there is a bit more. They try and force this whole thing with Grindelwald being in the background with some BS magical investigation, but the whole thing is utterly ridiculous. Even the characters are underwhelming. Newt is an uninteresting, no-personality, oddball. Tina is this unemotional, pathetic, weak-willed woman who just sort of wanders around. Queenie is amusing, but is an over the top ditz who talks and acts like she's in a trance all the time. The only worthwhile character is Jacob, who's amusing, fun to watch, and full of personality.The best thing about this movie is the special effects. It really doesn't have much of a story, and is obviously just hoping that the Harry Potter brand will rake in the money. It also tries, and fails, to add to the Harry Potter lore by creating things that did not appear in any of the novels or anything Rowling ever created. When it comes down to it, this movie is just something to watch when you're bored and there's nothing else on to watch."

Well, I'm here to tell you, the emperor HAS no clothes, and to be perfectly honest, it must be very very young people who are liking and rating this movie, that have barely ever seen movies, and just blunder about liking everything no matter how dull it is. This movie is so incredibly dull. All due respect to those who laboured over the special effects/costumes etc, and even the actors, who do the best they can with such a dull storyline, but in the end, nothing can save this film from being reminiscent of watching paint dry or watching grass grow.

",0.0,0.9905,2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"As someone who never fully immersed themselves in the Harry Potter fandom, this spin-off wasn't high on my ""to watch"" list. Sure, I liked the movies well enough for the continual narrative they provided (still haven't gotten to the books yet), and I understand that this parallel universe full of magic is a unique idea that hasn't been explored in this fashion, but this just seems like a tag-along to capitalize on a successful franchise. That's not to say that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) isn't good, it's just that it does require a bit of background knowledge in order to fully ""get it.""Partly because seeing wizardry and magic in the modern era might still seem odd, this throwback to the past is only made better by placing it in the United States. Both of these settings differ from the main Harry Potter franchise enough to be both a side-story as well as a prequel that explores some of the more obscure aspects of the mythos. While there are subtle chastisements at the closed-mindedness of Americans, there also wasn't much difference between the American magic and the British kind (other than what they called things). I would have almost liked it better if there were ""Tommy gun"" wands and New York magical mafias. Granted, there was a little of this last one, but not enough to be truly ""American.""In the end, Fantastic Beasts fails to deliver a solid antagonist for the ""uninitiated,"" since the anti-magic character didn't seem to affect the actions of the main character much at all, and the ""true"" villain was revealed at the end, but with no context (other than spinning newspapers at the very beginning) as to why he was bad or what he did to deserve his punishment. All this being said, Fantastic Beasts did provide a bit of entertainment and managed to show us some ""fantastic beasts"" along the way, as it promised.Another taste of magic to keep Harry Potter fans satiated, I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3.0 stars out of 5."

The cast is likable. Ezra Miller is extremely out of place in this movie. There's no consistent tone, sometimes Director David Yates makes it a fun magical movie about animals, and them sometimes it's an abusive dark sad story. J.K Rowling isn't a screenwriter and it shows, this film focusing on the small details of characters instead of giving a good story for a film. The story is inconsistent and uninteresting. The visuals are occasionally bleak, which isn't shocking for Yates, but for the most part it's a good looking movie. The music is fantastic.

The story is okay, just a bit more complicated than the first movie, but still a movie to watch with the whole family, kids included. The acting is okay from most of the actors excepted from the main character Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne. To me he's just a mediocre actor but that's my opinion.

If it requires getting rained on, it doesn't work on people indoors. And for the dead, does it obliviate the entire existence of the dead or just obliviate the death itself?

Meaning, effects, dialogue, acting, etc. was absolutely fine, as you expect from a production on this level. And while the plot wasn't a mess, or terrible, or incoherent, it seamed unsure of what it wants to do. A huge chunk of the movie is our protagonist searching for beasts, but there is nothing interesting about it. We as viewers just stumble upon them again and again, everyone knows whats going to happen, but we have to wait a few minutes before the cycle repeats. At the end of the first half it causes the movie to drag, you're unsure what the story is going to be about, since youre 45-60mins in and there seems to be no significant plot. Later the story unravels and I thought to myself ""oh, good. They DO know what their plot is."" But once again we get interrupted by creature hunting and it completely wrecks the tension that JUST started building. I do like the creatures and understand why they wanted to sprinkle them inbetween, so that you don't just get people running around and talking. But the creature part shouldve been cut back, especially because the movie spans 130mins anyways. Little moments of creatures would have been enough, have them there as helping hands or weave them into the plot (as they sometimes did).
If they really wanted to show some longer scenes with creatures, a mini-series would've been a nice vehicel for that and I'm sure the HP-Fans would eat it up happily.

" An Adolesecent Fantasy Tale
",0.0,0.973,2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"20 November 2016. Take a younger Matt Smith from Dr. Who, the British sci fi television series, place him in early 20th Century New York along with an Inception-like (2010) special effects and new visual fantasy world like Avatar (2009) along with a strong ecological theme and you get something like Fantastic Beasts. Fantastic Beasts continues the darker evolution of the Harry Potter world while inserting a comedic older muggle male character to help balance the tone of the movie. Whether or not the expanding beauty of this visual universe will retain its magic or not remains to be scene as Avatar set a new standard of imagination. And whether or not due to budget or technological limitations, the effects were not quite as great as to be expected with all the new visuals that Fantastic Beasts brought to the screen.The target audience of the movie script might be aptly described as the continuing audience who grew up from the original Harry Potter movies who were in elementary school and grew up through junior, middle school and high school. Fantastic Beasts includes the familiar ominous darkness and stark loss, evil abuse, as well as happiness, joy, and a pitch of accidental stupidity found in most of us.Overall, Fantastic Beasts is fresh, new, dark, and enjoyable with some meaningful messages endangered species, about child abuse, pain, and compassion and tolerance, something that America needs more than ever now."
" No charm, no character, no story...just CGI
",-0.4404,0.428,2019-01-11 00:00:00,3,"FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM is the latest instalment in the cash cow HARRY POTTER franchise and a total disappointment as a movie. I didn't expect much when I saw that artificial director David Yates, responsible for the shallowest movies in the Harry Potter film series as well as the awful LEGEND OF TARZAN, was at the helm, but Rowling's first-ever script promised something; it turns out she's a far worse scriptwriter than she is a novelist.This plays out as a prequel to Potter, with Eddie Redmayne - adopting a single gormless expression of wonder from beginning to end - on the hunt for various escaping magical creatures in 1920s New York. There's no plot at all, just endless chase scenes involving poorly animated CGI beasties, so the supporting cast have nothing to do expect add perfunctory romance/comedy/drama, none of which works. The CGI is blatant and used to drive the narrative, which it can't do, so by the time of the umpteenth magical battle you simply don't care. And they're making another four of these? Give me strength!"

The special effects are very good! And there is a good plot. Norbert Drageno
the main character is really funny. In my opinion Fantastic Beast is the best movie
because it's original with the special effects and its magic universe. The imagination by the author is incredible. It looks like a dream. The animals in the movie are very incredible,my favorite one is Picket because it is so cute.
Croyence is a mysterious character because we don't know if he is angry. Harry Potter fans should go watch the movie."
" A Fun Watch!

I'm so glad a friend asked me to watch this because this movie, although not as dark as the Harry Potter movies, was as enjoyable. The movie was an adventure. The special effects were amazing and I loved the Fantastic Beasts used in the film. The Niffler, the Demiguise, and the Bowtruckle were all adorable and so endearing! Eddie Redmayne was amazing as Newt Scamander and it felt like he was meant to play that role. Newt Scamander is an unconventional film hero. He's not big and muscled like the Marvel superheroes, nor is he an agile, street-smart hero. Instead, he is the sensitive and sweet type of person who your heart just goes out to. His bond with his animals, and also with his new friend Jacob was heart-warming. I loved how believable Redmayne was while playing the character. The supporting cast was great too and Dan Fogler was great as Jacob Kowalski, the clueless No-Maj who is forced into an epic adventure. The entire cast of characters brought something to the table and made the movie what it was: An absolute delight to watch!"

",-0.0772,0.8991,2019-01-06 00:00:00,5,"Me and my mum decided to watch it last night and our thoughts were exactly the same - meh. It felt like it would appeal to a young audience as a lot of it was just watching the beasts do their thing.I did think Redmayne was amazing at portraying a wildlife enthusiast; as one myself, I recognised the subtle quirks and thought his performance was spot on. The beasts were cool, though nothing hysterical or ground-breaking really happened. One of my main gripes is that I don't think the film allowed time for us to become invested in the characters, which meant that when it came to a couple of farewells at the end, the emotional impact wasn't really there. I especially think more could have been done with Kowalski, because his presence just wasn't that established. I don't blame the actor for that at all, we just didn't get to see enough of him or get to find him doing or saying anything wildly amusing or likeable.
I'm glad I finally got round to seeing this film and ticking it off the list. It was a nice watch to fill in a Saturday evening, but I won't be in a rush to see it again."

The special effects are great . . . but nowadays all special effects are, so this film is nothing special.Complete garbage."

" A Fantastic New Side of The Harry Potter Universe
",0.5574,0.999,2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,"With Harry Potter being a franchise I grew up experiencing I was of course very excited for Fantastic Beasts, I know everyone wasn't satisfied with this film but I found it to be a very exciting new adventure in the Harry Potter universe that left me excited for more to come.The magic of HP mostly carries over to this new world, it's great to see this new part of the universe from an adult perspective that makes this new series seem more mature than its predecessor. The American Wizarding community was built very well with fantastic visual effects, production and costume design that puts you in that 1920s setting.The new characters also mostly lived up to expectations. Eddie Redmayne played Newt perfectly, such a lovable and understated protagonist that allows us to feel his love for these beasts through him. Tina was a cute addition to the film, she had a great chemistry with Newt that built there relationship slowly. Queenie wasn't as developed as much as I would like but she was still a likeable and find part of the cast. Kowalski was my favourite character in this film, the perfect comic relief who had a great arc of his own and allowing us to see his a human would react to this amazing world in a satisfying way. The beasts themselves also lived up to their magical potential. They all looked distinctive and visually alive that allowed them to seem as terrifying as they did adorable.The film despite its magical elements, does have a lot going on and not all the plot elements mesh well together. There are a lot of subplots going on between the beasts and the American Ministry and they don't always play off each other well and do occasionally drag down the pacing. The tone isn't always on point with many of the lighter elements clashing with the films darker and more mature moments that leave the audience confused as to what emote they should be feeling.Fantastic Beasts is a great new addition to the Harry Potter world. It seamlessly builds the world to new heights while having its own feeling and sense of magic. The beasts themselves are visually striking and the new characters all make their mark. The pacing may sometimes be spotty and the tones may not always clash but it's a perfectly entertaining movie that sets up a new side of this world that can only continue to grow.8.4/10 - A- (Fantastic)"

No real memorable characters, no great arc, no emotional connection with anyone.So what are we left with? A dazzling visual experience, if you can look though the enormous amounts of cgi that to me reduces the wow factor.Comparing this with HP is hard not to do.

" Celebration of the the Wizarding World
",0.0,0.9972,2018-11-29 00:00:00,9,"When I first saw the film, I was nervous at first. There were so many expectations to live up to for this movie, and I didn't want to be disappointed. The movie starts off with a flash of magic newspapers, okay. Then it gets to the boat, Newt is there with his case, whispering to his creatures, hope and love in his eyes - that's when I knew. JK Rowling has done it again. I've seen this movie many, many, many times, but it always feels like the first time. My reactions are always the same, I laugh, cry, and smile at the same scenes just like I did opening night. What makes this movie so good is the fact that it's set in the wizarding world. What I loved about the Potter series has come back. Though it's a new setting and characters, somehow it feels so familiar. The new characters - Tina, Queenie, and Jacob - are so adorable and wholesome. Credence is a mystery to unfold and the cameo of Grindelwald foreshadows the dark future that's yet to come. The music just immerses me fully into the world, like Potter music always does. But what really makes the film is Newt Scamandar. He is the most sweetest, precious, angel bean cinnamon roll of a character Rowling has ever created. And as a Hufflepuff, like Newt, I'm totally in love with him. And as someone who was a fan of Eddie Redmayne before, I can confirm he was the perfect choice. With 4 movies to go and endless possibilities, this movie promises another magical adventure for a new generation. I trust Rowling with her storytelling, and I can't wait for what's ahead."
" Amazing Movie
",0.5859,0.9838,2018-11-29 00:00:00,9,"This definatly shows that JK Rowling can do more than just write novels. The plotline was great and the idea of having an extra prequel to the harry potter series makes it so much better. It was not as good as the harry potter movies, which were one of my most favourite movies series of all time, but they were still a great movie. The CGI really combined the movie and made it so much better than it already would have been. I would have liked more character development and it would have been a bit better to describe each character with a bit more of a backstory but i was able wo work without any backstory for any characters.Overall great. movie and would recomend"
" Better than Harry Potter!
",0.4926,0.9994,2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,"I am certain that this bold claim will be met with some criticism and want to point out that this is my opinion of this film, I simply enjoyed this movie more than the HP movies!
This was to my surprise as I expected the horrible dark screens that plagued the final HP films making them so dreary to watch and difficult to be truly amazed by but this film (for the most part) turned on the lights so to speak! The scenes are bright and the colors are fabulous!
I was thrilled to meet the fantastic beast characters as much as the human ones! Many movies are 'animal' type films at the expense of human acting, Fantastic Beasts is NOT one of those!
What it is is a truly enjoyable, tale of magic (good and bad, happy and well a bit frightening/ sad) and whimsy where some of these creatures we meet are as endearing as any Potter character !
The setting is fabulous, the 20's time period is perfect for jaw dropping and magical settings even before the actual magic is revealed! The jewel tones, wood grains and metallics are a delight and visually stunning creating the perfect backdrop for the beasts. Even the lovely pastels seem to ensnare you!
Newt and his friends are freshly written, well developed roles and the acting really sold these characters. Also of note is Ron Pearlman's portrayal of his character...you know you're in New York when Ron Pearlman dominates the scene!
Perhaps my favorite thing about this movie is the fantastical yet believable beasts and the interaction between them and the main characters! They are their own characters and as such become part of the family!
The inside of Newt's case was not only awe inspiring but was also home to some wonderful scenes, the disc containing deleted scenes was equally fun to watch and I found myself longing for more like the celebration and tracking the demiguise. Why those scenes were even removed is beyond me as they encouraged deeper character investment and the movie experience would have been much enhanced/better with most of those scenes in it but not enough to completely ruin the film by deleting them?!
I am also thankful the connections between this and the HP story are few and subtle enough that I can watch this and enjoy it apart from having any deep knowledge of the HP world! I do want to be swept away into a magical world by a beautiful, fulfilling story, I do not want to have to brush up on 8 films and several books worth of trivia before I can enjoy a film! There are characters mentioned in this that definitely relate to HP but not so individually or specifically that one would need to delve deep into the lore to understand what is actually happening. Grindelwald is a solid stand alone character with ties to HP stories, Lestrange is mentioned but deftly explained... all you need to know to enjoy this film is presented to you and if you miss a reference the story is still enjoyable!
Every story needs a villain and that side of this story is nothing new or groundbreaking. The villainous role(s) in this is tried and true, perhaps a bit overused and definitely given more screen time than it needs/ought to be but the other aspects more than make up for the abundance of dramaticly swirling black blobs....
The beasts themselves are breathtaking, creative, stunning and so deeply endearing in performance that they feel not only absolutely real (undiscovered and quite a bit above natural yes but whimsical and absurdly real all the same) but they also interact with the live characters in such a way that they are integral characters in this stor6 and the story is oddly ethereal and believable throughout.
This film was most impressive taking all that is wonder from the Wizarding World, adding a new level of amazement and leaving the flaws behind!"
" Its complicated and scary, at times, but still rather fantastic, haha
",0.8316,0.9665,2018-11-26 00:00:00,8,"Newt (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York with a bulging suitcase. All too soon, we learn why. Inside the carpetbag are ""fantastic beasts"", that is magical creatures unknown to earth. One slips out and its like the dam has burst as Newt runs to catch him while others escape. Meanwhile, in the city, there is a battle between wizards (one is Colin Farrell) and other magical beings and those who hate them, like Mary Lou (Samantha Morton). Caught in the middle is muffin-maker Jacob (Dan Fogler) who sticks by Newt to help battle the dark forces. From Central Park to Fifth Avenue, Newt and his gang have adventures to collect all the fantastic beasts and go back to England. Will he succeed? To explain the plot is quite difficult, so this viewer is not going to try. Suffice to say it has many twists, turns, ups and downs. Redmayne is sweet as the bumbling but caring Newt while Morton is absolutely scary as the evil Mary Lou who abuses the children she adopts on the pretense of saving them from the magical beings. Farrell is also great as the powerful wizard with a secret while Fogler is a total delight as film's comic, bewildered baker. Yes, too, the sets, costumes, and special effects are smashing.

I have watched all of the movies (except for the newest one Crimes of grindelwald) and i have enjoyed all of them.
I have only read 5 of the books and i will continue to read more of them
Cause the second Fantastic beast movie has been released i will review the first movie and tomorrow i will watch the second one.
This movie was decent.
It had pacing issues but overall i liked it.CHARACTERS
Newt is an acceptable protagonist who has personality.
We know he is an introverted guy who cares about creatures and want's them to live in peace.
They could have gone a little bit deeper with Newt as a character but i like the mystery behind him.
The biggest problem i had with him is that he didn't grow as a character and if cause of that it felt like the adventure was meaningless cause he didn't learn from it and grow as a character.
Jacob was mediocre he was just the mediocre comic relief and the guy people explain to what's going on so that we understand what's going on.
They didn't develop him enough he had motivation and personality but those where weakly developed and he was a mediocre character overall.
Porpentina was a pretty bad character as well they didn't develop her as a character and she was just there cause she is important to start of the plot and she is just there in the end of the plot.
She is more important than Jacob but she is also worse than him.
Queenie she has the same flaws as the other characters that they didn't develop her moving on.ACTION
The action lacked creativity so they just ended up being mediocre.
It's just a bunch of people casting spells and others blocking it and they almost didn't try anything new.
it was kinda enjoyable when Newt tried to catch all of the beast.
They tried something new but that ended up being decent.VILLAIN
Credence to me is ans should have been the main villain but instead they focused the plot to something else that was mildly important.
They should have made the movie longer so that they could have developed Credence more.
Credence could have been great he could have been a great misunderstood but he just ended up being a mediocre character that contributed to the ending of the movie.VERDICT
This is a decent movie with some good stuff here and there i will watch the sequel and review it and i will as well review all 8 of the Harry potter movies.
Go watch it i think you will enjoy"
" Decent Films and where to find one.
",0.0,0.9953,2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Decided to have another watch of ""Fantastic Beasts"" ahead of seeing the sequel. This, for reference, would be my third viewing of the film.In the film, Newt Scamander (played with reserve by Eddie Redmayne) is an English wizard, heading to New York in the 1920's carrying with him his menagerie of mystical animals in his suitcase Zoo. He soon falls foul of the US ministry of magic, initially via Tina (Katherine Waterston) and then her boss Graves (Colin Farell). But Graves has his eyes on a bigger target, an invisible force that is causing carnage on the streets and risks exposing the Wizarding world to muggle eyes.My experience with the Harry Potter world is pretty exclusively limited to the movies and not really the books or surrounding lore, so I think I'm judging these films not as am uber-fan, but as someone willing to judge on their own merits. That said, I really enjoyed ""Fantastic Beasts"". The period setting is great, the visual effects are stunning and the story is a premier example of creating a universe without sacrificing the narrative of the individual film.Some of the lesser known members of the cast, Dan Fogler, Ezra Miller and Alison Sudol, do an excellent job in raising their profiles with memorable performances. Colin Farrell is great also (so much so the ending is kind of a disappointment in that regard). Eddie Redmayne deserves praise too, other actors might have fought to iron out some of the idiosyncrasies in Newt and make him more of a traditional hero, but Redmayne keeps him a quiet honest boy, whose devotion to the preservation of life remains constant throughout. His chemistry with Tina is nice and underplayed too.I can see that in other reviews people have described it as a cash grab and although I understand where they are coming from - ""Universes"" can encourage lazy writing, or direction, on the assumption that people will show up anyway, but I do think there's an inherent flaw in the logic, with that as a criticism. Either the film is enjoyable to you, or not. An enjoyable Star Wars film would surely be better than an terrible film with a brand new IP."

Which is sad to say that I only liked ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."" The film's special effects and the performances in it were as fantastic as the beasts themselves but the same cannot be said for the plot. Now, it is not fair to campare the plot of a film to the plot of an entire film series.

",0.0,0.9758,2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,"Before he was even thought of, Harry Potter's name would go down in history books as one of the greatest wizards ever told. But let's back up 54 years prior to the beginning of Harry's time and let me introduce to a young wizard by the name of Newt Scamander. Newt is not your typical wizard you see, he is a ""magizoologist"" meaning that he takes care of any and all magical creatures, including the ones that ""go bump in the night.""
But this review, is not about the magical creatures, it's about the early beginnings of the first dark wizard, who compared to Lord Voldemort, who was not even heard of yet, so again let's back up. Because, like I said, this the beginning of the wizarding revolution. This movie begins in 1926, during a time when of turmoil. And a certain dark wizard started making his mark on the wizarding and muggle community, the first dark lord, by the name of Gellert Grindelwald.
Now I will say this, and then I will continue in the next review, yes, there is a sequel, the powers that lead up to the rise of Grindelwald will carry over - that is all I am saying, because of this known fact - all things must come with a price and with that price comes a great powerful responsibility. So yes, not only is this movie tied into the main Harry Potter series, but there are so many ""Potter-Eggs"" that I don't want to spoil anything for you.

",-0.3182,0.5388,2018-11-18 00:00:00,3,"Don't waste your time watching this movie. I wanted to go out during the movie, as it was so boring.
Such a poor story.I give 3 starts because of nice special effects and cute animals."
" Entertaining movie
",0.4404,0.0636,2018-11-18 00:00:00,7,Good effects and story. Not better than Harry Potter but let's see what will happen in the 2nd part.
" It's at its best when dealing with actual 'fantastic beasts', but it's just terribly uneven, I'm afraid.
",-0.25,-0.8843,2018-11-18 00:00:00,5,"'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them (2015)' is such an uneven film, going from some light, whimsical and often quite childish sequences of 'beast catching' straight into jarringly dark scenes featuring an abusive mother beating her adopted son or moments of quite brutal supernatural murder. This makes it feel like two or three totally different pictures violently forced together, each one of them being rushed and losing their proper impact and possible audience because of it. Pair this incredibly inconsistent tone and messy structure with the occasionally more noticeable, frustrating and, frankly, bad writing - including incongruous, downright poor character motivations and overall logic - and a 'sequel-bait' ending that actually makes very little sense and is a mockery of the whole ""one-time, disconnected spin-off"" idea, and you have an incredibly spotty experience that sometimes works - when our genuinely quite likeable and well played lead is getting on with the actual 'fantastic beasts' plot line - but is, even at its best, by far the worst movie to come out of the 'wizarding world' (at the time of its release). Of course, it no longer holds that title, thanks to the release of its immediate follow-up. 5/10"
" Not for anyone
",0.0,0.9316,2018-11-17 00:00:00,7,"As JK Rowling said, this new saga is not for anyone.. Only real potterheads are going to enjoy it as it deserves...great movie, wonderful cast, awesome effects, and incredible soundtrack!"
" A genuine disappointment
",-0.5106,0.875,2018-11-17 00:00:00,3,"I went into this with high hopes, since I enjoyed the original Harry Potter novels and the resultant movies a great deal.But about 30 minutes into ""Fantastic Beasts,"" I realized I was being bludgeoned by a movie that is ridiculously long on special effects and visuals, and woefully short on story and genuine character development, unlike the original books and movies.Alas, the Potter wizarding world was been infected with the same greed and hubris that overran Middle Earth in the wake of the Lord of the Rings juggernaut. The Hobbit, a simple, lovely, one-volume children's story was over-inflated into a bloated three-movie monstrosity.And now, the Potter universe is being stomped and punched and bled to death in the same manner.I morn."
" Absolute Let Down !!!
",0.0,0.4939,2018-11-17 00:00:00,1,"The film doesn't have any story at well just trying to make money for a leaving incomplete so that they can make sequel.
J K Rowling is out of Idea and threw this Rubbish to the audiences. She thinks audiences are fool to accept anything garbage she writes. I'm certainly not going to watch 3rd one."
" Better now that the sequel is out (No Spoilers)
",0.4404,0.5714,2018-11-17 00:00:00,4,"The first time around this is seemingly the worst of the J.K. Rowling films, however after seeing Fantastic Beasts II (Crimes of Grindelwald), where she connects the dots between Fantastic Beasts I and Harry Potter VI this becomes a much more interesting film. As was the case with HP VI, however, these could have easily been made into one film rather than dragging HP fans along for the profit. We know that J.K. Rowling was basically homeless when she suddenly hit it big -- and that Johnny Depp is now basically destitute and suing his managers for gross misappropriation of funds -- but that doesn't mean that the team should make sincere HP fans destitute by dragging the story out. It's a greedy little venture we're watching unfold."
" A stunning film with a few issues
",0.3818,0.9804,2018-11-17 00:00:00,9,"First of all, a majority of the casting for the characters was fantastic. Each actor or actress fit their respected role perfectly. This can be seen with Eddie Redmayne. He just played Newt in such a way that he was relatable. He was such a charismatic character that everybody loves. Also, Dan Fogler was hilarious as Jacob Kowalski. He had pretty much all of the funny lines in this film. He also was the audience character which was nice to have in a film like this. The score by James Newton Howard was incredible to hear. The costumes in this film, which are Oscar-winning, are fabulous. They look like they were taken out of a history book for what people might have worn in the 1920's. The last good thing I want to mention is the visual effects and set designs. Their production design was Oscar-nominated and you can see why. You can see how much detail went into each set that they wanted to show in this film. Same thing with the special effects. All the beasts and creatures in this film looked remarkable. Now some things that they could of fixed was the pacing in the film. The pacing was all over the place. It almost felt like they didn't know how to end some scenes or they thought the scene was too long and cut it too early. This also could be a cause of some poor editing. There were some awkward transitions in this film that didn't make sense. The last thing I want to mention is the plot holes. I feel like the writers had to ignore them or else there wouldn't have been a film. In the end, Fantastic Beasts is a stunning film that just has a few issues but I still recommend to watch."
" Right down there with the Twilight series
",0.0,0.8442,2018-11-16 00:00:00,4,"Cash grab J.K. Rowling with her merry band of Hollyweird associates wooed audiences with nice period costumes and quality production, covering a carcass of hollow story and characters bereft of real drama. It is the kind of quality writing on par with the likes of Twilight series."
" So where can we find them?
",0.0,0.9382,2018-11-14 00:00:00,6,"You know what was good about ""Harry Potter""? It had ""Harry Potter"" in the title and it was about Harry Potter. In ""Fantastic Beasts and where to find them"" there are those ""beasts"", but the problem is that the movie is not about them and has a single word about where to find them.
The film begins with a battle of a group of mages and a mysterious dark sorcerer and a bunch of newspapers headlines about someone called Grindelwald. Who is it? That's a good question. If you want to know than go watch sequel, because he is not in this one. The twist of Grindewald's exposure is very weak, it simply leads to nothing. Throw it out of the movie and nothing will change. Oh, wait, if you do that than it wouldn't be so interesting to see the sequel. It's really sad when the first movie of a cycle tries to sell you the sequel.
What is a real pity is the fact that the beasts are absolutely gorgeous, but there's too little screen time with them. The story just begins when some of them flee, later they become a secondary storyline, giving the first place to Creedence. He is a very powerful wizard, who turns into an obscurus, a dangerous magical creature, by suppressing his magical powers. And someone might say: ""But here is your magical beast and a story about it!"", but it is a very cheap move. The viewer clearly understands that the story of the beasts ends with the capturing of the last escaped creature, long before the end of the movie. Who is this Creedence guy? Why should I care for him? The whole movie feels like the creators just stuffed too much and didn't bother to make some part really good.
But no everything is bad here. Eddy Redmayne (Newt) and Ezra Miller (Creedence) are superb in portraying their characters. You could watch this movie for their performances alone. It's difficult to say something good about other aspects of this film. The editing feels raggy and awkward, the stories are skin-deep, and the sequel baiting is frustrating. The movie had potential but it lacks of polishness almost in every aspect."
" Great movie and better than the last couple HP
",0.7906,0.9718,2018-11-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie was fantastically designed by set design, acting, and costumes. The story line was good and certain characters played their part so well you really wanted to hate them, like the President lady, and love like the human. The human was the best character in this movie and really did great acting."
" The magic and wonder is ever present
",0.0,0.997,2018-11-14 00:00:00,8,"This is it, what we all wanted a Wizarding world film script written by J. K. Rowling herself.
The Harry Potter movies never had chance considering the source material being immensely dense and detailed, a lot was lost, but here you don't feel anything is sacrificed to make space for more ""important"" stuff to receive time on screen.
The best part is the writing, it has the amazing style Rowling utilises in her books, the false antagonists all the way to the big reveal.
The computer generated images are everywhere and it is a given but they are of such a high quality that you don't feel like they are fake, they look perfect.
Even to the smallest details.
The sound and music is well done, of course the Hedwig's theme is not the main theme anymore, but we get small cameos of it, however the music does not seem to have a specific distinct theme and is more of the samey bombastic orchestral piece that have become so common in movies in the recent years.
But the sound is amazing and detailed, from the faintest tick tock of a clock to bigger explosions it is well done and clear.
The acting leaves nothing to be desired, of course we have some of the biggest male actor names in the world here, Colin Farrell, Eddie Redmayne, Johnny Depp but the best duo on screen after so many years of bland duos got to be Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol.
These two along with all the amazing creatures make this movie shine bright and beautiful.
I found myself liking this film more than any of the Harry Potter films which is amazing considering how much I love Potter books.My score for this amazing start to an intriguing adventure is 8 out of 10.
Only if the music was better and the lead female was more fleshed out."
" Too much is as bad as too little
",-0.5423,0.8992,2018-11-13 00:00:00,6,"It can be seen that the director and the screenwriter are not satisfied with simply completing a fairy tale, but the world view is too limited.
The film was stuffed with too many dramatic elements, but the arrangement between the main line and the secondary line did not constitute a uniform style, nor did it have enough persuasive logic support.
The over-functionalized emotional flow rendering attempts to use ""coincidence"" to compensate for the constraints of this play, but in fact has little effect. From this perspective, the setting of ""Fantastic beasts and where to find them"" is both gimmick and cumbersome."
" Give it a chance. You will be pleasantly rewarded.
",0.8074,0.9477,2018-11-12 00:00:00,8,"I initially found the drawn out back story on the fantastical creatures and the chase scenes to be tiresome. At that point, I went and found what others said about them. Yep. Seemed like the editing was sorely lacking. Too much CGI.However, it was such a downer to quit on what seemed like such an enchanting idea, and well done scenes. So I bore on. I'm glad I did. After getting past the above two drawbacks, It became an *awesome* story, and the CGI and scenes really drove it home. I can definitely let the drawbacks slide, and I no longer see them as such drawbacks. They have the effect of drawing you in more solidly. I like the fact that the ending between the protagonist and the other person was *not* stereotypical. I mean, who needs more formulaic mulch. This was done with heart and loving attention to detail in a way that matters.And just to inform anyone who may be assessing my review: I am *not* a Harry Potter fan. I mean, the few movies I saw were alright, but my positive review of this movie is not fandomming."

Take the Harry Potter movies, who are already great, and give them a bit more of the best things they have.It has great actors, story, effects, characters, costumes and the dialogues are awesome.So Honestly, Do Yourselves A Favor And Watch This Amazing Movie.

I forced myself (and my wife) to watch this over the course of 3 sittings. It was so boring in the beginning and I really didn't care for any of the characters.I also found the CGI in this movie was a bit off putting, I am not sure if there was just too much of it, or maybe they didn't do it right or maybe the actors weren't grooving properly in front of the green screen but I really felt like Newt was talking to himself most of the time. I found his character annoying too. Nearer the end when the focus was off of Newt and his wonderfully awesome CGI beasts (blarf) the movie finally started to pick up. If this is the first in a series then I would compare it to the first Harry Potter and although I find it a bit cheesy and childish I think Philosopher's Stone did it better than this one. I REALLLLLLY want it to get better and I will give the next movie a try but it's hanging by a thread for me. Super disappointed :("

" A Worthy Prequel
",0.4404,0.8171,2018-07-29 00:00:00,7,"There has been a suggestion that this film is the start of what is apparently going to be a Harry Potter prequel series. Well, the films do occur before the Harry Potter films, this one being set in 1926, and there are slated to be five in this series to be released, but a part of me feels that as opposed to the Star Wars prequels, which Lucas was said to have envisioned long before they were released, but wasn't able to produced them due to the lack of technology and the costs involves, these films seem to simply exist to capitalise on the Harry Potter phenomena.
 Honestly, I don't necessarily believe that this is a bad thing, especially if something works, and from the results that this film produced it is quite clear that it was very well received. Okay, Cinema Sins wasn't all that impressed with the film, but then again that is Cinema Sins and you generally take everything he says with a grain of salt. Still, he is right in one thing and that this film simply exists to capitalise on Harry Potter, and a lot of flaws that he points out do hold a lot of water. For instance, I pretty much worked out who the bad guy was (the wizard Grimwald) right from the word go, and also there does seem to be two films running in tandem, though I don't necessarily believe that this is a bad thing.
 Anyway, we have this zoologist, Newt (or mago-zoologist to be more precise) arriving in New York. He says that he is interested in meeting up with a breeder of magical creatures, though as it turns out the Americans aren't really all that keen on magical animals, and in fact are hunting them to extinction. Newt's goal is to basically convince the world that these creatures aren't all that bad and that we should learn to admire them for the beauty that they happen to be. Oh, he also carries around this case that happens to be a portal to an extra-dimensional world where he keeps all of his creatures.
 The thing is, as happens with a lot of these films, is that our friend arrives in New York in the middle of a crisis. There happens to be this invisible creature running around causing havoc everywhere. However, he has other problems on his mind because his case ends up getting switched with a muggle's case (I could see that happening from a mile away as well, particularly since it was quite clear that they happened to be carrying the same case). Anyway, there is another wizard, Tina Goldstein, who is in disgrace and is doing everything she can to get back into the wizard's good books. Not surprisingly, since a muggle happens to have the wizard's case, when he opens it all of the creatures get out.
 I guess that was the better part of the film, our protagonists running around trying to get all of the creatures back into the case, and the sub-plot (which turns out to be the main plot) of the wizard who is trying to suppress his abilities, and that in turn being released as a violent force that is destroying the city, probably wasn't all that necessary. Then again, this does happen to be main stream cinema, so I guess that this sort of subplot is actually needed. Of course, you also have Grimwald lurking around somewhere, though as I pointed out, it is pretty obviously right from the get-go who he actually is.
 Still, I quite enjoyed this film - it was actually a lot of fun. I guess it was a refreshing change to the the films that basically followed Harry through his time at Hogwarts. Mind you, from what I could tell I'm not convinced that these films are going to be setting the scene for the events in Harry Potter - this one doesn't seem to have any real connection with them, with the exception of a mention of Dumbledore and Hogwarts. Another thing I liked was Newt's character - he came across very shy and reserved, which I felt was very well done. You honestly don't see many characters like this these days."

" Messy beginning for a saga, but with enjoyable elements
",0.4767,0.9864,2018-07-14 00:00:00,6,"I am fan of Harry Potter. I have read all books, seen all the movies, and even I had 'Fantastic Beast and where to find them' book long before this project was announced. So I think the idea of a movie about this is a little bit confusing. However, I went to cinema hyped and remembering all good moments Harry Potter saga delivered me in childhood. But this movie was not up to the expectations. Hype did a disservice to this title. Harry Potter is a collection of books, and all the potential this world offers, was insufficiently exploited in a movie script. In fact, I did not understand the movie's direction very well. Is this a movie about differences between magical people and no magical people? About a 'cold war' between the two worlds? About Grindelwald's dark intentions? Or is it about chasing pokemon? When the movie makes its pace, a strange scene about strange creatures appears and changes the atmosphere. It's messy and confusing, because the plot involving magical attacks, second salemers and the candidate for president is interesting and intriguing.Also, the design of the creatures was unexpected. I know they're all from the book, but in a film of magical creatures, I expected more creatures like dragons, gryphs, centaurs, etc. Something more mythological. In particular, the erumpent scene was shocking in terms of banishing the dark atmosphere that was growing with the plot before mentioned, and seems too childish.But apart form that, the movie has very good and very enjoyable elements. Colin Farrell does a powerful and menacing character, specially in the interrogation scene. I loved the character of Tina, she manages to perform a prudent, doubtful but good-hearted role, and her relation with Newt seems very honest and natural. As I mentioned before, the dark atmosphere of Harry Potter is succesfully managed, and the movie is visually stunning. Also, the work of the musical department is outstanding, having its climax in the thunderbird flight, which is a powerfull and very beautiful scene.The movie has its enjoyable elements, but fails to reach the hype with some messy issues. It is an unstable beginning to a saga, and it somehow seems that it is a movie made thinking more in the sequel that in its own. However it does not ruin the potential it has, and I hope sequels could overcome this one because we know what Harry Potter world is able to give us."
" Visually great, but what was it about actually??
",0.4423,0.8346,2018-06-28 00:00:00,4,"Despite the big hype and the film's huge commercial success, I did not enjoy it one bit. It is cartoonish silly at times without an ounce of realism. Just like JK Rowling's Harry Potter series I couldn't be bothered with anything about this movie. It's just not convincing. The visual effects are indeed incredible, but that's just it; the film is all about effects...I still don't know what the film is really about. The story was just not interesting enough to justify me sitting through this for over two hours. It was like watching a documentary on what can be accomplished with effects. Nothing else."
" The first of several Harry Potter spinoffs
",0.0,0.8553,2018-06-11 00:00:00,8,I was so excited when this was coming out. We get the world established by JK Rowling and more magic. Newt Scamander goes through New York City in the 1920s having lots of adventures and interacting with both Muggles (no-majs in America) and wizarding folk. The sisters didn't hurt either and the creatures were all well-done. Not your typical Ray Harryhausen-styled critters. But it was good for a period piece. Both American and English actors stole the show and it's a whole new ballpark for the Hogwarts saga. Now bring on the others!
" A failed historical fiction with absolutely no sense of history or intrigue *SPOILERS*
",-0.6997,-0.995,2018-06-06 00:00:00,1,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" takes the ""Harry Potter"" series in a new and exciting direction through its use of historical fiction. The story takes place in New York after 1929. In the opening scene, our hero Newt finds out firsthand how difficult it is for immigrants to get through Ellis Island. Many from other parts of the world are turned away just for being seasick, or for the new quotas instituted by the government, as was really the case back then. Newt barely gets through the exhaustive inspection process, enduring many indignities before he finally reaches land. The event humbles the aristocratic magic user, but also focuses him on the task at hand.The reason for this heightened security is a sense of paranoia in America stemming from the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, both cataclysms blamed on witches and wizards hiding within the country. The misery suffered by unemployed Americans standing in bread lines helps fuel the anti-magic movement, known as the Ku Klux Klan, into a furor. The biggest moment came before Newt's arrival, when a mysterious person revealed to the newspapers that wizards and witches live in opulent hideouts, resembling speak-easys of the ongoing Prohibition. Word of a grand conspiracy is afoot.Newt is on a mission to heal this divide and expose the true terror behind what's been happening in America. He knows the villainous Grindelwald is on the loose, that it was he who leaked the existence of magic to the American muggles, sparking the anti-magic Klan movement. With the humans distracted, Grindelwald wreaked magical havoc on the stock market, leaving the muggles frightened and subservient. Then he teleported to the Midwest, infecting the soil with his dark magic until it blew into choking clouds of dust.Newt has traveled to America as he has learned of Grindelwald's third and most ambitious plan yet. A plan to help the fledgling Nazi party through their fascination with the occult. Though he's uncertain if he's up to the task, Newt has brought with him a suitcase filled with magical creatures in hopes that they can help him stop Grindelwald. He finds a small group of rebel magic-users who he hopes will stop this villainous plan before it's too late.No.No, wait.I'm sorry, none of that happened.""Fantastic Beasts"" is a completely squandered opportunity. Despite being a period piece, it has no sense of history and uses the time period as little more than an opportunity to let its characters wear period clothes. The film takes pains to tell you it's taking place during the mid-1920s - before the Depression - and though the twenties are still ""roaring,"" everything looks drab and dull as if the Depression had, in fact, happened. This decision has long-reaching consequences as it prevents the film from being historical fiction.There is an Ellis Island scene, but again, nothing is done with it. Newt breezes through the checkpoints with virtually no incident. The film also made clear that Newt wasn't an immigrant, but someone who's simply visiting, further preventing this scene from being used to its fullest potential.There is an anti-magic movement in the film, but there's no reason for it to exist. The ""roaring twenties"" were a time of carefree excess, a time where the U.S. economy was booming after World War I. There's no crisis known to the humans that justifies such a movement taking place, as the Depression, the Dust Bowl, or even the rise of the Nazi party could have. Grindelwald is in this film, too, but isn't even revealed until the very end of the film. His nebulous presence is used in place of any real-life historical events, and is thus much harder to understand. Having seen the trailer for the sequel, it's clear this was done merely to keep this going as a series, which was to the complete detriment of this first installment.In short, this is what happens when a British person tries to understand American history or American culture. Just like John Oliver has before, J.K. Rowling failed.I'd have less of an issue with these decisions if the film had something much more interesting waiting on the other side. Unfortunately, there isn't. The entire film is very drab, dull, and slow-paced. The characters with the single exception of Jacob Kowalski (played by Don Fogler) remind me of the Jedi from ""The Phantom Menace"" - they act without passion and act a little too secretive, concealing their motivations from the audience. Only Kowalski's story is relatable as the ""everyman,"" but even then it's uncomfortable watching him be manipulated by the female love interest pretending to like him.The result was quite possibly the most boring film I've ever seen. Longest two hours I've spent in a theater. What a waste."

" It's the not-so-secret love child of Michael Bay and J. J. Abrahams after surviving a weekend at aunt Rowling's. when she was on drugs!
",0.7712,-0.9972,2018-05-18 00:00:00,2,"I don't like making bad reviews. It makes me feel bad for the actors and crew involved, and I believe they meant well.
But, as a die-hard Harry Potter fan, I felt even worst watching this movie! Insulted, even!The question that popped on my head every 5 minutes of film was ""Is this what would happen if Michael Bay would direct something HP related?"". The answer is ""Yes."", sadly.
It did take me a lot of time to finally watch this, I watched on 18th of May, 2018. Why? Well, I did have a bad vibe about it. And damn, I was right.It´s a Fantastic Show of CGI! And nothing but that! It´s like 98% of the movie is just CGI, and there are half a dozen characters around. And neither of them are important at all. The so called ""fantastic beasts"" are irrelevant! Newt is irrelevant. All of them, all of that, all is irrelevant. It has no connection to the Harry Potter world at all. They just hold wands (and just sometimes), and occasionally cast a spell.The fantastic beasts appear for brief moments, short minutes, and are useless! New has an ultra-magical suitcase that holds an entire city inside, and that city is filled with fantastically useless animals. And they show up for mere moments. But the deal is, they didn´t even have to show up. They don´t matter. At all! It seems like those scenes are just for the CGI crew to show-off, ""Look what I can do now!"", and they created scenarios inside Newt´s bag, and showed some huge and crazy-looking animals. And that´s it!Oh, and the ""Michael Bay"" touch: destruction, explosions and mayhem throughout 1920's New York City. I mean, half the city was wrecked, but at the end of the movie, the ""American Bureau for Magic"" (or whatever, I forgot the name, it's also useless!) fixed everything in a matter of minutes. So, if they could do all that, why were they worried in the first place? The CGI scenes are way too long, too heavy and unnecessary! Newt's beasts are useless, the wands are useless, the whole damn movie is pointless!The house-elves. Oh, damn. Well, it seems America is indeed the Land of the Free, because American house-elves were already free and rich by the year 1926! Wow, call that progress! However, wizards still lived in fear of muggles (sorry, No-Maj), and hid from view.It's not a Harry Potter World movie. Wizards, wands, the half a dozen spells that were cast, it could all be removed, and wouldn´t be missed. Actually, there's no plot at all, no character's depth, no meaning to anything. It's a crazy made-up story about Grindelwald that we were never told before. Maybe because it's stupid and pointless. It's like things happen at random, people are lost among the wreckage of a city inhabited by idiots (both wizards and normal folk), and nothing matters.There´s the cute friendship and love thing going on with the 4 main characters. Of course, there's gotta be a cute message. But the Aurors also killed a kid at the end, so that's nasty! Grindelwald was disguised as an Auror and nobody noticed. Tina was clumsy and dumb, and was also an Auror. Her sister read everyone's minds at all times, and never knew what to do. Kowalski, the muggle, accepted the whole magic world all too easily. Newt was also dumb, way too weird and stupid. I mean, the guy destroyed half a city just to get his pets back. Of course, to hell with civilization, let me just get my cute pets back, because humans are evil! Yeah, makes total sense, Mr. Old-School-PETA-soldier! And sure, his beloved pet saves the city (or the world?) at the end, when Newt reveals he had a special potion his big bird could use to fix everything. Completely believable. Yes, it is! It happen to me last month too! And, poor Mr. Grindelwald was also lost and confused in all that. The most powerful dark wizard (in my opinion, even greater thatn Voldemort) was completely lost. And, at the end, he got his derrièr kicked by Newt, who, I've no idea why, decided to cast a spell called ""Revelio"". I mean, why did he do that? To bring about the movie climax? Sure. But why? What was he suspecting?It´s all stupid and pointless! An insult to HP fans! I got really angry and disappointed at Rowling. And, surprise surprise, it'll be a 5 movie thing! Because, sure, let's make things worse! Money!I's a ridiculous movie! There's nothing related to HP world. The wands and spells are useless. The beasts are useless. No plot, no story, useless characters. And way too heavy on CGI!It's the not-so-secret love child of Michael Bay and J. J. Abrahams after surviving a weekend at aunt Rowling's. when she was on drugs!If you love the HP world, if you're a fan, stay clear from this! Seriously!"
" Fantastic Beasts and Why Not to see it
",0.5574,-0.8932,2018-05-10 00:00:00,2,"My wife was adamant that I should see this in the theatre. Thankfully I didn't. Same old Rubbish, Huge bunch of CGI, no script, some really bad acting (Eddie Redmanye is plain awful which is shocking). Random beasts jumping from here to there, hocus focus and blah blah. In keeping with the poor quality of the harry potter movies this one is a wastage of 2.5 hours. PS My wife slept off half way :("
" A bad side effect.
",-0.5423,0.9985,2018-04-30 00:00:00,6,"Don't read this review if you liked this movie. I wasn't expecting this to be that good even when I saw the previews for it. After having seen it, I feel a bit sad that this movie exists. The reason that it exists is because it's a cash-grab for studios. They can claim otherwise, but I really don't believe that anyone actually said with a straight face ""you know what I bet would be great? If we adapted a fake magical textbook into a movie."" It's almost like Warner Brothers execs are admitting that they'll do whatever they need to so that they can milk as much money as possible from their Harry Potter property.I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but I still enjoy the movies and books to some extent. It's a cool world and the books and movies are all pretty good. But this did not even feel like it was in the same world of the original stories. The thing I'm noticing with these spinoff movies that are starting to become a sub-genre is that they are (aside from not being that good) lack the things that people really like about the original series they are derived from. A major thing that was appealing about the Harry Potter stories was that the entire series was a mystery surrounding Harry himself and why he survived where so many others had died. The whole wizarding world was an amazing backdrop to those stories and the elements of that world often tied into the story in important ways.This movie, unsurprisingly, did not incorporate the world as well as all that. It almost felt like I was watching Newt Scamander and company play a big game of Pokémon in 1920's New York. Some of the scenes where they had to catch Newt's creatures were interesting and engaging to watch, and thank God, because there was very little that interested me for the rest of the movie. I actually thought I might be in for something good after the opening scene with the little mole creature running wild in a bank, very good choice. But after that the movie got involved in a boring plot with a bunch of uninteresting and flat characters. Proof that this is a cash grab is further displayed by the way the movie sets up a sequel featuring Grindelwald and a younger Dumbledore. I don't want to fault any individuals that worked on this movie for what I perceive to be its lack of quality. But it was sad to see so many big and good actors wasted on this movie. Really, you could have cast anyone in these roles and it probably would have done just as well and even given some up and coming actors a chance to shine. I don't know that this would ever have been a great movie regardless of how much work was done on the story, but I think there could have been a much better story derived from it.This is a fine family movie, and I won't think less of you if you enjoy it. But I ask that you not support any of the sequels that come from it. In my opinion movies like this are barring the way to a lot of good original movies like Get Out. I get it that sequels and reboots and all those extensions of existing IP make money, but if they are as bad as this movie was, then seriously it needs to stop. I've ceased to be that impressed by visual effects, which is really the only thing that this movie brings to the table, and I hope that I'm not the only one. I'm not saying adaptations like this shouldn't be made, but I would just say that if you're going to make it, at least try to make one that has potential to be good (yeah, I'm talking to you too, Rogue One). Overall Rating: 5.2/10."
" Too bad Eddie Redmayne plays in it
",-0.3612,0.9601,2018-04-28 00:00:00,7,"I wouldn't go that far as saying that this movie is bad. It's a bit of entertainment, for the whole family, with some good CGI moments. If you don't like fantasy movies with weird creatures then you shouldn't watch this one because that's basically the whole movie. The story isn't bad either, not complicated at all, and that's good if you want to watch it with the whole family, kids included. There are some big names in the cast and there are some good actors and actresses, but the major issue I have with this movie is the main character Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne. He is the major letdown of this movie, not only because of his stupid face (that he can't help of course) but because of his acting. He's just not a good actor, and I really don't get what the fuss is about this actor. I can simply not stand his face, and so why women would be attracted to him is just a mystery to me. The movie could have been much better if they had somebody else playing Newt Scamander. For the rest the movie is okay if you like special effects, that are well done, and a bit of fantasy as entertainment."

But in the end it was just very bad.The acting is bad.The monsters were just ugly as sin.I have never read the book but I just think Ezra Millers character was just bullied through out the movie and boy he was a miscast. I can't believe this guy is the new Flash.I have really enjoyed Harry Potter and his books but not this movie.The only good thing to be coming out of it is special effects and the fact that Johnny Depp was involved. Other then that. Don't waste you time."
" Exciting and endearing
",0.4939,0.9939,2018-04-15 00:00:00,8,"This movie was both exciting and endearing. The set-up is strong: while admittedly setting the stage for further entries, an entirely new magic world is introduced in New York City, with a cast of characters that are exciting to watch. The level of imagination in realizing the setting is, as the title suggests, fantastic. The digital work accomplished on this film is stunning - more than enough so to rival the best of the Harry Potter films. The cast is wonderful with Katherine Waterston- she proves to be a true leading lady- Alison Sudan -wonderfully flirty- and especially Dan Fogler. His dynamic performance and emotional relatibility is the key ingredient to the films success. While Eddie Redmayne portrays the main character admirably, his performance comes off as one-note, making it clear that his acting chops, while underutilized here, are being saved for future installments. Looking forward to what comes next in this franchise."
" Definitely not as expected....
",0.4019,0.9887,2018-04-05 00:00:00,2,"First of all I have to say that I'm a Hary Potter fan, having spent hours reading all the books and watching all the movies again and again (for those who will say that I'm a JK Rowling hater...). It's needless to say that I had big expectations from J.K. Rowling and her new films series but I was really disappointed... After watching the trailer I expected to get thrilled with her new work but I feel like this movie used the fact that all the fans and new people willing to watch J.K. Rowling's new masterpiece would pay and as a result the movie would break the box office. First of all I have to say that the plot was ok but nothing in order for you to say wow. The use of CGI during the entire movie makes it boring and ""child friendly"". I firmly believe that the magic suitcase which can travel you to a different world definitely isn't the best she can do. Also, doubtless one of the reasons why Harry Potter lasted so long was the fact that it showed us every character's personality and how all the friends matched together. It's wasn't all about the story and the production (since both have CGI) but it's about how everything was made in order to give the feeling that your part of it and make you want to participate in every scene. That's something I missed in the new movie since I made me feel like I'm watching a film for two hours and that's it. Hope the next one will do better."
" Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Review
",0.5574,0.998,2018-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a film directed by David Yates. I had watched some of the Harry Potter films years ago. Then I came to know about this particular film which was a prequel to the Harry Potter Films. Seeing the craze of the Harry Potter series in many people, I decided to give this film a try. And I enjoyed it.Plot: Newt Scamander arrives in New York when some of his creatures escape from his suitcase and it is upto him and his allies to save the day.Story and direction: This is J K Rowling's first film as a screenwriter and I can say she has done a wonderful job in creating a world where both magicians and normal citizens live together. Hats off to David Yates and team, for creating a world for creating a world I so want to be in. The creature designs were fantastic and that goes on to say how talented the crew is. The characters for this story were so mesmerizing. Each of these characters had something to be liked. The comedy also was so good and never felt forced or out of place. The action scenes were so nicely done. The production design and costumes transported me back to the 1920's. But the film, was not all perfect. The film's first 20-30 minutes, felt little flat for me. But that was understandable, as I was getting to know this world and it was a slow-buildup movie. Also the editing and VFX in certain portions of the film felt little haywire.Performances: Eddie Redmayne was very lovable as Newt. The little chacacters nuances were perfectly performed by him. Katherine Waterston also provided some great support to Newt's character. Dan Fogler was the comic relief and he was impressive. Allison Sudol was good too. Ezra Miller was awesome. You could feel the pain his characater was going through. Colin Farrell was great. And for those who haven't seen this film, I would say just wait for Johnny Depp. Yes, he is there in the film. But I won't go any further.Favorite Scene: Again no spoilers but there is a scene involving, Newt, Tina, Queenie and Jacob towards the climax that was heart-touching. I also teared up for a bit. Verdict: I had a fun time watching this film. For a person who has not been updated with the Harry Potter series, I fully understood the film. And was quite happy that the film didn't rely on Harry Potter. It's good on its own. I am going with an 8/10."
" Really Enjoyable

That's true of most sequels/prequels. This movie was made for one reason. The Harry Potter movies made money. A lot of money!! And Warner Bros were not ready to give up on the goose that laid the golden egg just yet. So they set about trying to kick start a new franchise.These movies should not appeal to me, but I do enjoy watching them!! Maybe it's because of the fun my kids had watching them, and I got caught up in their excitement. I dunno. But I find it entertaining anyway.I have a real soft spot for Eddie Redmayne, and I enjoyed his performance as Newt. In fact all of the leads are engaging. As for the movie sufficiently detached from the Potter books/movies so that a viewer doesn't need familiarity with the latter to enjoy the former. But there are enough call-backs for fans to know that we're still in the same universe. Depp filmed a secret cameo (which amazingly in this day and age, was kept a secret) Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them grossed $234 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 12th highest grossing movie of 2016. So it was the lowest grossing and worst performing movie from that universe, but considering it was a prequel, that features none of the original cast I think it did quite respectably. Enough to warrant a second movie to be released this year anyways."
" Cringeworthy Rubbish
",0.0,-0.8215,2018-03-30 00:00:00,1,"I like Harry Potter series, the last film of 2 parts was really spellbinding, and the serious tone of later books / films was oretty cool. OK, I said, this film is a part of Potter universe, and also, there are several excellent actors there - this one should be great effort. No, very loud and very clear No. Eddie Redmayne is te first and the main cringeworthy factor here - his drunken, sloppy, shaky delivery smacks of such obvious amateur aura that it makes it not even funny - it makes it sick and shallow. Evrything is a flop here - it is not a kid fairy tale, being too violent and vile. It is not a serious later Potter film, being too silly and sleazy. It is not even a parody, being too serious to its demerit. Another awful mess is Colin Farrel's part, leaving only smork and sickness

Rowling serving as a producer and a writer for the screenplay, putting pen to paper on how exactly she wants to mold the narrative and characters herself.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" takes place in J.K. Rowling's Wizardly World and follows the adventures of Newt Scamander, a wizard and magizoologist, played brilliantly by Eddie Redmayne, who has a British fairy-tale charm to him that suits the main character to the tee. The movie has a well-bonded cast with the main highlights being Katherine Waterston as a down-to-earth witch and Dan Fogler as a mild-mannered No-Maj.
Unlike the other films of the Harry Potter franchise, this one is set in New York during the 20's and has a very different vibe then your commonly known Hogwarts grounds.While the spells aren't as complex or fun as the ones in Harry Potter, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" counters with various magical creatures to its lore, making it the perfect film for children.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" continues on the magical stories of the overall franchise and it laid ground for new series of installments without the eponymous young wizard."

The previews had dissuaded me as well, because the creatures all seem to be CGI. And they probably are, but I still found myself enjoying the movie. Yes, there were too many computer effects, but the characters and old time setting were fun and well done. The music was also very good.

Not to say that you're not going to enjoy this mediocre clichefest - you're just less likely to do. The Effects - The effects are decent, but nowhere near as good as they thought they were. There is a scene where a bunch of wizards spend like 3 minutes repairing a city whose only purpose serves to show off the effects and help bloat the runtime. Some of the effects were pretty good, but there were a few that looked very bad.The Plot - This movie is too long and full of too many boring subplots. The main plot, though as painfully cliche as all the subplots, is decent. This movie probably would've been better if they stuck to the main storyline and cut out some of the nonsense (even though its jumpstarted by an infuriating suitcase and makes next to no logical sense).The Characters - Most of the characters are stupid. A lot of them have potential, but they act like complete morons. If more of them acted intelligently, this movie could've been a bit more fun.Comedy - This movie is actually pretty funny when it isn't boring or confusingly stupid. There are a lot of good sight gags and funny situations (though some of the funniest bits are in the trailer). The Creatures - I liked a lot of the CG creatures. The designs were nice and these things had presences in the movie. Some of them looked better than others, but for the most part these things were creative.Logic - As you get to a certain point in this movie, you start to notice that almost every thing that a character does contradicts something else that happens in the movie. Anything that gets established is later ignored. Its infuriating how almost nothing makes any sense. If you actually think, you'll realize that according to logic nothing that happened in this movie should've happened.

" Charms and moves ... but often in ways unintended
",0.2382,0.9992,2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"British Harry Potter-directing veteran David Yates now teams up with J.K. Rowling with the ostensible key aim of taking Harry Potter fans back in time (to the 1920s) and across the ocean to New York. This would seem like major wish-fulfilment for aficionados interested in how the wizard world integrated (or failed to integrate) with that of the muggles (then and there referred to as No-Majs - abbreviated ""no magics"") in another place in a former time. This leaves us largely free of cross-references to Britain's wizarding world already well known to us, except for single mentions of Hogwarts and Dumbledore, a brief appearance of ""our"" Minister of Magic in America, a brief if important reference to a member of the LeStrange family, and development of information on magical species that did appear or were mentioned in the Potter novels and films. Obviously add to that the key importance attached to wizards Grindelwald and star-of-this-story Newt Scamander, as here played somewhat idiosyncratically (if of course ultra-Britishly) by Eddie Redmayne. In Redmayne's hands, Scamander is a slightly uneasy mix of absent-minded and capable, clever and inexperienced, attractive and oafish. The perfomance is OK, but looks a bit uneven. Certainly, his character needs to be reined in by someone, as indeed it is - very beneficially, by 3 characters - as the film develops (see below). The huge question here, then - and actually a very significant one from the point of view of enjoying the movie - is how one approaches ""Fantastic Beasts"". Just what kind of mindset should the viewer adopt as he or she gets comfortable in the armchair?For me, this does not fully work as ""another Potter-like wizard movie"", and I'll say that straight out, for any benefit to others that statement may have.Given that the main storyline here (magicked up from no real basis in Rowling's book) does NOT actually hinge upon Scamander's attempts to recapture animals of varying degrees of wackiness or cuteness that have escaped from his suitcase, I did - I must admit - let much of this (relatively time-consuming and centre-stage) aspect of the film wash over me. Surprising, given that the Rowling book was about that, but naturally you can't make a film out of an encylopaedic bestiary...! At some level the film work with the magical creatures is of course beautifully done, but it integrates with the NY surroundings better in some cases (as when an Erumpent goes to the Central Park Zoo looking for potential mates among rhinos and hippos), worse in others (as a ""Niffler"" grabs jewels and coins from stores and banks). Presumably, it is a kind of kiddy-fare, though it must be said that Fantastic Beasts is NOT especially a child's film other than in this aspect. One thing I did like about these chunks of the film was the Redmayne-Scamander conservation message, which is not overdone, but done... As ever in the Potter universe, an intriguing aspect is the co-existence of the magical and normal worlds, and the Big Apple take on this is quite spectacular. However, it must be said that the recreation of 1920s NY is magic in and of itself - something to be absolutely lapped up and appreciated by anyone willing to distance themselves a little from the ""Potter"" content of the movie. Likewise, an effortless and yet tour-de-force performance as an ordinary (if perhaps atypically kind, decent, patient and well-meaning) New Yorker is put in by Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski. In portraying this Polish-origin would-be baker of Polish-style paczki donuts. Fogler does not put a foot wrong in a performance as someone who accepts and then comes to relish the magic he is suddenly exposed to in his hitherto tough and humdrum life. It's a pleasure to watch him, and only magnified when he rather quickly becomes a subject of love interest for the overwhelmingly kind, mind-reading witch Queenie Goldstein, as played with absolutely aplomb by Alison Sudol, who looks a pretty picture in her 1920s outfits. Queenie is way out of Jacob's league in terms of looks, but she grows to love him anyway, and this sweet pairing is a highlight of the film. Since Queenie's older and more serious sister Tina (played nicely if with restraint by British actress Katherine Waterston) rather rapidly forms a pair - of sorts - with Redmayne's Scamander, we have the 2 pairings that are the strength of the film, one might even say irrespective of various other more or less-relevant scenes and plots that come along. At some level, this is then a two-charming-couples-in-New-York-in-the-Twenties movie, which provided this viewer with considerable satisfaction in and of itself, and - while that was most likely not the makers' intention - it works, so why knock it?Jon Voight is in there but doesn't do much, in a section of plotting that scarcely gels with the rest of the film. Colin Farrell does play a key role and does pretty well, as does Ezra Miller as a disturbed young wizard suppressing his wizard-uality (yes, it's that kind of reference) and causing death and destruction as a result. The closing scenes of the wizards' repair and restoration by magic of all that destruction brings the old city and lives of its inhabitants back to centre stage, and it was for me a profoundly and surprisingly moving experience to see things put to rights, in the company of stirring and touching music from the ever-reliable James Newton Howard.Overall, I enjoyed ""Fantastic Beasts..."", but seemingly for various eclectic reasons that won't necessarily appeal to those seeking to take this ""next JK Rowling adapation"" straight, at completely face value."
" Lackluster spinoff from the Potter-verse
",0.0,-0.1089,2018-02-15 00:00:00,6,"British wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) shows up in 1926 New York carrying a suspiciously animate briefcase and soon strange beasts are running wild in Manhattan. Superimposed on this situation are some secondary stories of a dark wizard trying to establish a magical Reich, a disgraced Auror (Katherine Waterston), and a muggle cannery worker (Dan Fogler) who wants to be a baker. There is not much of a plot, the movie is primarily a series of CGI set pieces strung together. Typical of Rawling's 'Harry Potter' stories (and movies), there is a lot of clever imagery and imaginative moments that serve to cover frequent inconsistencies or lapses in logic in the plot and the ending of the film is especially contrived and flimsy (see 'goofs' for details). The 'fantastic beasts', while well rendered, are not particularly interesting, perhaps because they were just made up for the movie (the vivification of 'mythical' creatures was one of the highlights of the Potter series). The movie also suffers from the trend in the HP series to make the 'magic' more action-friendly: the wizards now handle their wands like handguns and fire spells at their nemeses, making 'magic battles' look like shootouts in Star Wars. The script is OK and the actors are all quite good in the roles (especially the central three characters) but overall, the movie is an uninspired 'by-the-numbers' opus targeting a guaranteed audience of Potter-philes."

Engaging & Most Of The Characters Are Very Likable. However I Found That Some Of The Scenes Were Not Given Enough Time To Develop Before Moving On To Next Scene. Overall A Very Good Family Film; Full Of Magic & Charm."
" Mostly For The True Potterheads
",0.4215,0.9807,2018-02-10 00:00:00,5,"This will be one of my simplest film reviews on IMDB, as it is pretty clear to me along what lines this film will be split. Casual fans of the Harry Potter universe? They'll probably leave a bit disappointed or mystified. The true Potterheads (who know every nook and cranny of that universe)? My bet is that they'll come away with a much greater sense of enjoyment.For a basic plot summary, ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" tells the story of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a young wizard with a penchant for studying odd creatures. While just trying to conduct his studies, he gets mixed up in a power struggle between the muggles (or ""no-mags"" as they are referred to here) and the wizarding community. His only ally seems to be Tina (Katherine Waterston). In a separate subplot, a wizard named Graves (Colin Farrell) is fixated on a boy named Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who seems to be more key to this storyline than his meek appearance would suggest.I consider myself a very casual fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I've read all the books, watched all the movies...and that's it. No multiple readings/viewings, no obsession over all the little details and names. To me, the Potter universe is more shallow than deep (my own experience here...I know that universe is indeed quite rich if one chooses to do a deep-dive). I enjoyed watching Harry and Co. grow up in their journey together, but that is about where ""Harry Potter"" ends for me.As a result, there are two reasons why I found this movie to be just middle-of-the-road:1. Put plainly, the story of Newt Scamander just isn't as engrossing as the other previous material. Whether this was meant to be the case (more of a ""side quest"" mentality) or whether the execution was flawed I can't say for sure, but to me this was a tale that just kind of meandered in terms of narrative. For a movie that is supposed to be the launching point for main character Scamander, it sure spends a lot of time elsewhere. One wonders, then, if Scamander was used more as an ""excuse"" to re-enter the wizarding world than being fleshed out as a great character within it. Even the charming acting of Redmayne couldn't quite make me believe that I was seeing anything special in this case.2. This is the kind of movie that obviously is building off fragments of the Potter universe. Because most fans are of the obsessive variety, I think, there isn't all that much context given. The film just assumes that a base layer of knowledge is already present in viewers...a base layer that I did not posess. A good example of this: the reveal of the name Grindewald in the opening minutes of the film. That name did nothing for me, and nothing was ever really done to hammer the significance home. The film just assume viewers know the significance of his place in the wizard world.So, I think this is one of those reviews that leans more towards my subjectivity than perhaps the overall quality of the film. This isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. Based on filmmaking alone, it is probably more of a 7-star film. However, in terms of its appeal to me personally, it gets dropped down a few pegs. I'm just not a big enough Potter fan to understand all the little inside winks-and-nods or ""easter eggs"", and those are things that must be understood to truly be enveloped in the experience."
" A very charming and entertaining movie! (no spoilers)
",0.82,0.9919,2018-02-09 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a movie starring Eddie Radmayne and it's apparently a Harry Potter prequel, although I did not see those movies. This movie tells the story of Newt a wizard who carries a suitcase full of fantastic beasts and from there all sorts of complicated things can happen and so we have a movie.I'll start by saying that for a guy who never seen a Harry Potter movie this movie made me wanna directly watch all those movies. It balances so well magic and real life story with some great set pieces that feel like you are in the 19th century or whenever this movie is set. It was a very entertaining movie with a fantastic performance by Eddie Redmayne. I don't know why this guy reminds me of Matt Smith and his 11th doctor from Doctor Who. Eddie's performance is very good in this movie and in my opinion very underrated. The other performances were also good and really gave the characters enough humanity to make them believable. The score was also excellent, once again James Newton Howard proves his a master with movie music. He scores an extremely versatile music score with comedic and dramatic music blending in so well. The story is somewhat rushed and underwhelming, although I got the overall main plot but certain sub-plots were very weird and not emphasized enough to absorb me into the story. The visuals were great although no match for The Jungle Book. If I was to have some issues i'd be that the movie is not so emotional moving when it tries to be or that some scenes and characters felt weird along with their motivations but overall I got the point of what the movies was about with them. Overall a good movie with good performances and very good music, excellent set pieces especially the costumes (which won an oscar btw), but somewhat of a underwhelming story and some weird scenes and characters. 8/10"

To be honest, I didn't read it, I just peaked a little. As much I saw, well, it's just a list of all creatures and who found them, etc. But when they turned into a film, it's superb. Some say the movie is all about visual effects and all, but compared to the book, it's a huge difference. It's like heavem and earth different. The actors performed amazingly and I loved their performances. The plot is good and it's good to see all the amazing creatures. That reminds me to tell about visual effects. The visual effects are very good. I even felt that those creatures were real in the real world. At that time, I kind of wished I was Newt. All in all, it's a great movie like Harry Potter films."
" Well composed glimpse into a small segment of the Potterverse
",0.2732,0.5246,2018-02-08 00:00:00,8,"I've made an account just to add this and downvote a simply rubbish review that was on the front for this movie. I believe the majority of negative reviews come from the fact that the movie actually requires you to do a small amount of independent research to understand the background, leaving most people perplexed when things happened without explanation. This is highly rewarding for those that have read the source material, as the movie does not hold your hand, or provide droning exposition to make sure Grandma understands.In my opinion, anyone with an understanding of the references this movie leans on (American witch hunts, Fantastic Beasts the book, and the ""Potterverse"") will love the movie."
" A great Harry Potter prequel

In his latest travel to the United States, he has an accident with a normal guy and together get involved in a deep mystery which is threatening the normal course of every day events.Although it doesn't seem much, this plot manages to create a wonderful atmosphere, powered by some very impressive CGI, keeping you interested in the faith of the main characters and their creatures. It's a very good display of magic in the same universe which brought many wonderful moments in a lot of people's childhood. The actors do a good job in portraying their characters, making the whole story more pleasant, very enjoyable and also unexpectedly funny! It's a must see for every Harry Potter fan, every fantasy loving person and everyone who enjoys this genre."

",0.0,0.9889,2018-01-26 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it was first shown and, honestly, I rated it with one star. Where was the magic of Harry P? Where was the friendships? I was truly bitterly disappointed. But I bought the DVD because I loved the music and then a little bit of magic happened. I liked it! Seems that on the second time around I was able to take in the story, much of which had passed by me. However, it was only watching it the fifth time that I understood the nuances of the screenplay.
However, now we come to the negative side of the see-saw. I found the small pieces of exposition jarring. JKR could have done better. And I know that because I've written a few things myself. Unbelievably, I found Katherine Waterston's early parts in the film, lacking in timing, but it was only a few times. Yes, Eddie Redmayne mumbled a bit. I'm English, living in the UK and even I had trouble understanding some of his words. Seems to be an wretched pattern nowadays. I still don't know what part the little flying azure bug had but perhaps that'll sort itself out. And that's about it, so back to the positive.
The special effects were astonishing, Dan Fogler was very funny, the music (of course) was sublime and praise must go to David Yates and his production team. And although she may never read this, thank you, JKR for giving us this wonderous and magical world, and I look forward to the end of 2018 for the second instalment."

Though there are some details in the film which I found good; like production, how they make everything fit the historical context which the story is based on, for example the briefcase (being the resource of Newt's magical products, being relevant to the story of the motion picture), also the production design, costume design, I like how the played with the colors, and used some specific ones to create a good photography.
One of the reasons why I don't like a lot Sci-Fi or Fantasy movies is because of the use of many special effects, but I was quite pleased with those shown in the movie.

We already know what New York looks like. We already know how spells work. We know the government and dark sorts of magic are the ""enemy"" in this universe.
The movie didn't know whether it wanted to be for grown ups or kids. For people who like action and mysterie, or fantasy and comedy. I'm sorry, but you can't put all those things together in two completely different stories in one movie, if they have no connection what so ever up until the very end. You know what were never really the enemy in HP and thus a completely cool and new Potterworld concept? _Muggles_ as the enemy. The Witch hunt, anyone? Not a single school or save place to teach magic and keep hidden to write a movie about? How the English witches and wizards spread their magic across Europe and America in medieval times? 
Well, maybe the shock value of seeing witches and wizard students and alike burned at the stake or hanged, but it sure as hell is a better idea than a cliché scavenger hunt in a cliché setting with cliché, unfunny comic relief characters in a cliché city. My god, from all the places in the world, after the beautiful castle and nature and beautiful sets in Harry Potter, you choose a dirty, dark, filthy, busy, well-known city? And then not even having any consequences to the distruction and eyewitnessing that occurs? Then what is the point?! There is no reason this story should take place in New York or any city really.
And the pairings. Oh goodness, the awkward pairings. With Queenie and Jacob as the ""Charming, funny, sweet"" couple and Newt and whats-her-face, Porpensia? (dear lord, such an unbearable, unlikable character) as the ""socially awkward illogical couple"" I mean come on. The books may be different but the movies all have a shocking lack of chemistry between the romantic pairings. Yikes, how awkward to watch.
And performances so wooden, like that of whatsherface Porp.. something, or the eyes averting awkward pile of unintelligible acting from Eddie Redmayne, the ridiculous ""No-Maj"" word, every scene with Queenie's borderline slutty character, That Rhino matingdance, the enraging ILLOGICAL decisions the character made to create more drama-, all at least worth a cringelevel of 56 failed handshakes.Even as a big Harry Potter fan, this movie was boring to watch. Two hours of shiny CGI along with two different stories, five different villains and four heroes who are about as interesting to watch as watching paint dry. Not even the forced, shoved in references to the original franchise do not help, as one of the last things we find out from this movie is that Johnny Depp is gonna be the main villain. Noooooooo...
It hurts."

The plot is about creatures running rampant in New York city and the main characters need to return them to a magical suitcase before non-magic folks discover anything about the wizarding world. Even though it was about magic, I still found myself getting lost in the well executed plot. It was set in the olden days and never once broke that setting.The screenplay of this movie was decent. There were times I had trouble understanding what somebody said and had to listen closely. Although that happened, I was glad the actors stuck close to their characters. Which brings me to the next point, the acting was really good and never broken. At first, all of the characters had different motives which made it exciting when they decided to work together to get the creatures back in Newt's suitcase. The special effects for this story were quite interesting and well done. It was fun seeing a whole new world full of magical creatures in the suitcase.There was never a time where I thought anything looked kind of fake, it all seemed quite real. The music in the movie was quite subtle. I had watched it last night and even now I barely remember any of it. In my opinion, that's good because it matched the scenes and didn't mess anything up. The editing was pretty nice as well. I'm sure somebody who read the book would be unhappy with me right now because of how I'm being so optimistic about the movie. I'm being honest, the plot progressed well. The only issue I had were some of the cut scenes to the orphanage, they were sometimes unnecessary or too quick. Overall, this was a good movie that I would definitely watch again sometime in the future."

It's about restoring the balance of things in America with the release of a ""Thunderbird"" creature by young wizard Newt Scamander, barely in his 20's. Like Hogwart's, there is a magical school and a Congress of Magicians, but it's all in the U.S.A. circa 1926. As always, great production values. Enjoyable on it's own but I can't possibly go through another ""5 Part Series"" as the Harry Potter movies just got darker and meaner with more death and destruction as the series progressed. However, I did like this first one and Johnny Depp might make a great ""foil"" if he doesn't over-act, which he sure tends to do. ""No-maj"" people and wizards in love? Unacceptable!

Not in the slightest. This is, quite literally, fan faction of Dr Who in the Harry Potter world. How so?Matt Smith. At the time this movie was produce, Matt Smith wasn't too far retired from Dr Who. And look at the similarities. The hair, the bow-tie, the general demeanor, the magic stick.1. The hair, combed over hair style. While Newt's is more fluffy than Matt Smith's Doctor, it's still the same general combed over style. Matt Smiths' was just more styled in a clean version.2. Bow ties are cool. Bow ties, nothing more.3. Similarish overcoat and dress style.4. Tool of choice. The magical wand vs the sonic screwdriver. Generally just as ""magical"" and the key to their general survival, but can function without it.5. The protection of misunderstood life. While this is common place among Dr Who, David Tenant and Matt Smith were most profound for this in the recent series, communing with misunderstood life, which wreaked havoc upon humans.6. A portable dimensional space. TARDIS or suitcase, both are bigger on the inside to house unimaginable things.7. Travel. The TARDIS is both a form of space transport and time travel. While the TARDIS is capable of time travel, here's the first real obvious difference between the two. Apparition is just teleportation, something both Time Lords and Time Agents are well versed in. The TARDIS is capable of changing its appearance due to the chameleon circuit. Obviously, Matt Smith repaired this to turn it into a suitcase for this movie, before it short circuited and reverted to the familiar police box again.8.The Doctor has been capable of traversing alternate universes, albeit by accident, in the most recent series.The Doctor ended up in the Harry Potter universe and adapted. His immense intellect allows him to pick up magic very quickly, which is just another form of science, based on the universe's rules. This is explained in the episode The Shakespeare Code, where ""witches"" use and terrorize William Shakespeare. He continues his belief that life is sacred and must be protected. He stores multiple life forms in his TARDIS. His antics match that of Dr Who in sticky situations.I've heard things about this movie from other people, and I've finally come around to watching it, with nothing else to watch, and can see nothing but Dr Who as a wizard.Good job, J.K. You made a fan-fic and dubbed it a new series in your own universe. Still a good story, by Dr Who standards, but mislabeled."

Set in 1926, Newt Scamander arrives at the Magical Congress of the United States of America with a magically expanded briefcase, which houses a number of dangerous creatures and their habitats. When the creatures escape from the briefcase, it sends the American wizarding authorities after Newt, and threatens to strain even further the state of magical and non-magical relations. The film does have quite few issues, I mean even it's conception is weird. Apparently this is based of a book that's based of a textbook in Hogwarts. The actors are all good choices my favorite being Eddie Redmayne as Newt. Colin Farrell was also good as Percival Graves, Katherine Waterson was good as Tina, I'd say most of the actors were good. Except Ezra Miller he was just playing some weak emo kid. The problem with the characters is that even the main ones like Newt, Tina and Queenie. They were all quite uninteresting. The best character in the movie is actually revealed at the very end of the film and is played by Johnny Depp. When Johnny Depp plays a pale weirdo it usually isn't good. Unless everything else is and he's only weak link. The ending was kind of good but I was hoping that the events of the film who would lead to the consequence of the wizarding world being exposed to muggles and would be left open to explore that in a further film. The best thing I can say about the ending is that it feels like a complete when I watch it. The special effects were good and they seem to be keeping David Yates on directing the rest of the wizarding world movies, I mean he's been on this franchise since Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix( which is the first Harry Potter film I saw in theaters and went back saw the rest became a fan and finished the series). You would hope David Yates directs other types of films soon to expand his horizon but the direction was good. If any I wasn't big on the writing for this movie. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a nice start to this prequel series set within the wizarding world with good actors, effects, direction but just overall poor writing. I'm giving Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them a three out of five."
" Mind blowing experience
",0.0,0.6908,2017-10-30 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I've seen this year.Don't understand some of the poor reviews.This films based on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, one of the companion books to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Simply incredible. Watch this movie and unleash your imagination. I saw most of the Harry Potter movies.However, this one has a very similar theme, however way more engaging.The movie is set in New York in 1926, seventy years before the Harry Potter series, and features Newton Scamander as a main character."
" Surprised by the negative reviews on IMDb
",-0.4215,0.9967,2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"As the heading suggests I am very surprised by the negative reviews on here, I am a big fan of the Harry Potter movies & wasn't overly keen to see a new franchise start up just yet as they did such a good job with the original films, so I did wait a while to see this film, but I was impressed with how much better it was than I thought it would be. This was a great prequel to the Harry Potter world, this movie does a good job at setting up a whole new world without relying heavily on the original Harry Potter movies. The things I liked about the film: The visuals - were outstanding here as all the monsters were really well done & quite different from what we have seen before (especially that oversized rino). Especially once you seen what was inside that suitcase, the world & monsters within really were visually impressive.Characters - Newt was generally a like-able character as the main hero, I hadn't heard much about him before but thought he did a good job in this film. Kowalski was good as the comic relief for the film but also added some surprising emotional scenes towards the end of the film which I did think was a nice addition to his character. Colin Farrell as Graves was quite menacing as the main villain & the nice little twist at the end only enhanced his character too. The only negatives I have for the film is that as it kicks off a new universe I feel that there was some things left unexplained such as the Lestrange character, sometimes getting the feeling that often happens in set-up movies that there are many story lines crammed into the one movie, however we can only hope that these story lines are touched on more in future films.I am now certainly looking forward to the fantastic beasts & where to find them franchise & what lies ahead."
" Good for television, bad for movie
",-0.1531,0.9488,2017-10-16 00:00:00,4,"Its mediocre TV entertainment at best. I cannot just believe that David Yates did both last Harry Potter movies and this movie. Seems like totally different directors. Harry potter 5,6,7a,7b are all totally amazing and this is crap. Guess Steven Kloves (screenplaywriter of HP 5-7b) was important.In this movie, the idea with a wizard zookeeper is kinda interesting, but gets really boring fast actually. And the plot continues in its horrific fashion. Also the agents repair the whole city in a flash. No, just no, the repairing magic is serious magic not performable by most wizards, sure in Harry Potter 6 we saw Albus Dumbledore (best wizard who ever lived) do this kind of magic in one apartment, and it was way slower than when these ""agents"" repaired the whole city.Gellert Grindelwald was only seen in a short glimpse, and it was strange and awkward, the battle ended in 10 seconds, nothing interesting, zero novelty in that battle.OK so in all it was a very bad movie like 1 or 2, but there are of course some positives with it, since i gave it a 4. The main character, the zookeeper is actually an interesting awkward personality. And the scenery of this movie was very very good. I love the art deco environment its trust worthy, just because of this i gave this movie 3 points extra."
" I hope the magic will return
",0.4404,-0.9291,2017-10-10 00:00:00,5,"Generally speaking, I enjoyed watching this movie, but there certainly are some flaws which I hope will be fixed in the upcoming ones. Let's start with the protagonist - Newt Scamander. I thought he was fairly likable, but I was waiting to find out more about his past, his personality and his quest, which never happened. I don't know if the producers thought it was worth waiting with the reveal of his backstory till the next movie, but can't agree with that. The other characters: the muggle (or no-maj) baker Jacob Kowalski - likable and funny. I also liked Queenie and the romantic subplot between them. The ""main"" side-kick, Tina, however, was nothing but an utterly boring character with an equally boring backstory. I kept wishing she wouldn't stick around for the whole movie, but she did.The main problem I have with this movie is the messy plot which is supposed to be about Newt and his journey, but somehow ends up bouncing around the presence of an ""obscurial"" in New York city, a creature never mentioned in any of the HP books/movies btw, which only adds to the confusion. I personally didn't quite understand what obscurials were and why everyone was freaking out about them.Then there's the bad guy who doesn't really seem bad nor good and you spend more time hating the obscurial boy's cruel stepmother. The obscurial is supposed to serve some purpose I guess, but is destroyed in the end so the subplot never fully makes sense. The kinda bad guy turns out to be Grindelwald which is cool for those who have read the books, but otherwise the reveal just feels awkward.And last but not least... Where is all the magic?? The beasts are present and there are some magical elements. The entire bar scene was probably my favorite part of the movie because it finally felt like being back in that magical universe we all came to love. But otherwise - very few spells were cast and when they were, it was completely stripped of any emotions which felt wrong because of how much emphasis there was on the emotional aspect of spellcasting in Harry Potter. Overall, it was a fun enough movie but with underdeveloped characters, and as a whole simply didn't feel magical enough. Not giving up on this franchise though, and I hope the magic will return in the next movies!"
" Another crappy movie...
",-0.5574,-0.9898,2017-10-07 00:00:00,3,"Hmm... where to start? I watched this sh!t on the last day of school with my friends at a farewell gathering. And what do we usually do when we're at a gathering? Movie-watching. and that 2 hours and 15 minutes was a f*king waste of our precious time! At first, we thought that we will go back home all sad and unwilling. But after seeing this shitty film, a feeling of disappointment and anger rush to our hearts. No story. Bad plot. Lame and ridiculous CGI. Bad acting. Misuse of actors and actresses and so much f*king more! F*ck this film! F*ck Warner Bros. Pictures!"
" Not very impressionable
",-0.0938,0.9885,2017-10-01 00:00:00,5,"I watched it without any expectations but even then I felt that bad director effect that in my opinion had fantastically ruined the 5 harry potter movies. Yes, we fans would accept and love everything that is thrown at us and the director and Warner bros knows it, hence they just makes a movie with paper thin characters with zero plot or character development, all-over-the-place story, and anti-climactic effects. But since we are a sucker for the universe, the characters, the whole magical world we will just smile and throw our money at them. David Yates is one of the most horrible director who knows how to ruin good franchises much like Zack Snyder or Ron Howard and the fact that he is being allowed to reprise his role as a director for another franchise is beyond me. The HP movies were saved because of talented skilled actors who knew what they were doing. Same would probably happen to this franchise since there are even bigger names attached like Johnny Depp and Jude law and also the potter heads fanaticism would do the rest. WB would get hits after hits while the director just rides on the success of his mediocre direction. oh, and lets not forget the special effects which were pretty spectacular and did like 90% of the job, the creatures or beasts are great but their importance to the original story is just so minimal that its ridiculous. Trust me,this movie would have banked in the box office if it didn't take place in the Harry potter universe or the name would be attached with Harry potter."
" More style than substance
",0.0,0.9203,2017-10-01 00:00:00,5,"1926, New York. Newt Scamander, an English wizard, has just arrived in the city, complete with a suitcase full of magic, including a rather mysterious creature. He soon discovers that wizards and witches are not looked upon favourably and is soon in trouble with the authorities, due to them clamping down on wizards and witches. When his magical case is switched with that of an everyday, non- magical citizen, adventures ensue.A prequel to Harry Potter, and I'm not a Harry Potter fan. This said, the movie initially seemed to have a decent, intriguing plot, so I had hopes for something good, well, better, more substantial, than Harry Potter.Alas, it was not to be. The movie soon falls back on the Harry Potter formula of style-over-substance disguised by a host of sci fi / fantasy themes, terms and effects. Ends up just being special effects for special effects' sake."
" Tried to cram too much into one movie but a decent watch
",0.0,0.9922,2017-09-30 00:00:00,7,"One of the more obvious reasons I wanted to watch this movie was that I'd been watching all the (more recent) Harry Potter movies in theaters and this was, in a way, a Harry Potter movie, so I felt an obligation to myself to go and see this. Another was that the setting was in America. While location was never a concern for me, because magical word, who cares? just saying this was going to happen in America got me curious. Would it be different? How? Would we see some of the people from the HP series when they were younger?! (You have no idea how much I need this)In a way we did get slight mentions of Dumbledore and Hogwarts, but they were never really the focus of the movie. The one character that did overlap both worlds, however, was Grindelwald. I won't really go into too much detail here because that would mean SPOILERS and honestly, I hadn't known about him until this movie.In terms of human characters, I was rather disappointed. We have our main protagonist, Newt Scamander who has a bunch of nearly extinct creatures in his suitcase, is studying them, and is trying to get one to Arizona, its natural habitat. But other than this quirky habit of caring for them and doing strange mating rituals, there's not much else to him. Yes, he's brave, yes he's got some connection to Dumbledore, but not much else.Even his suitcase had more personality /sigh/We also meet Tina who is part of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) and the one who ends up arresting Newt when he first arrives in NY (his niffler escapes and causes mayhem!). Of course, her arresting him and taking him in clue us in that she's been demoted and is no longer supposed to be arresting wizards (for some reason). Instead of letting Newt go, she becomes his shadow and ""helps"" him recover his suitcase, which had been taken by a No-maj (muggle) who mistook it for his.I initially didn't care much for her because she was just doing her job, but as the movie progresses she becomes more annoying. I also felt it was harder to connect with her because she was the more selfish of the characters. All her actions were less because she was worried about exposure and more about trying to get promoted/recognition. Even at the end, when she had a change in character, I still didn't like her because her change came from self-preservation.Then we have Jacob Kowalski (aspiring baker) and Tina's sister and roommate, Queenie Goldstein. Jacob is the no-maj who just happened to be at the wrong place when Newt's niffler causes mayhem in NY. I think I was particularly attracted to Jacob's character because he was a no-maj and was just so fascinated by the magical creatures. He helped out Newt care for them in the suitcase, he got chased by a huge Erumpent that wanted to mate with him, and still didn't freak out because technically this stuff isn't supposed to exist, right?And then we have Queenie, who seems to be pretty lady of the series. She looks good and knows how to use that charm to her advantage! She is also well versed in legilimency, a sort of mind-reading ability, which I absolutely loved. I actually didn't think she'd be a main character but she surprised me in actually taking action (unlike someone else in this movie)Just going to say that near the end she has a scene with Jacob that legit broke my heart.Overall I think the movie was OK. It really tried to cram so many ideas into a 2 hour (ish) film, which I felt was its biggest downfall. I mean, the majority of the movie was spent finding the creatures that had escaped Newt's bag, which I felt should have been enough for the one movie. But then they had to add the whole exposure aspect, which was less detailed and more rushed."
" Written for an American audience, they say. BAD idea..
",-0.6408,0.5788,2017-09-29 00:00:00,5,"Understand...Americans don't like GEEKS for heroes. And honestly...we're sick of Johnny Depp's phony accent. I tried to like this film. But in all honesty, in reading the books and character profiles, I half-expected Scamander to be some ""Indiana Jones""-archetype. Instead...he's a miserable geek for whom I cannot endear myself. In the future...consider what characters are most successful with American audiences."
" Possible recommendation
",0.0,0.7009,2017-09-28 00:00:00,7,"It was OK as an independent film, but the fact that it linked to the Harry Potter universe it was slightly disappointed in my view as I was expecting the Harry Potter feel to come across in it, however it was somewhat creating its own feel to it by trying to establish itself as the first to the Potter franchise. Now I may have done that for you and I understand that but I didn't get that when I watched it. Frankly I got a bit bored at moments although Eddie Redmayne is a fantastic actor and he nails every role he has, I wasn't as invested with his character this time. I can't remember what really happened after they see the destroyed house, so clearly it didn't have a massive effect on me as a film, I might recommend this to someone but it would not be my first recommendation.

" Negative reviews are misleading reviews. This is a separate series with entirely its own host of merits.
",-0.5719,0.9977,2017-09-25 00:00:00,10,"It is really quite absurd to me seeing even one negative review left for this wonderful movie, let alone the generous handful there are. To be led by them is to be misinformed. You can't help but get the impression that the individuals disappointed by Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them are individuals who came to the table demanding a continuation of the Harry Potter series, and that it never promised to be. This film features a new, exciting range of faces and that in itself is refreshing, tipping just the right amount of the cap to the previous films.What Fantastic Beasts does is continue that wonderful style of story telling. Every bit of the thoroughly entertaining whimsicality remains and if anything, I'd consider this to be a slightly more uplifting and child friendly contribution to the wizarding world of Harry Potter.You are convincingly thrown into the hustle and bustle of 1920's New York from the very start and it must be said there is such great emphasis on that 'fantastic beasts' element throughout all of the film. It feels truly educational in its style yet suffers not one moment of slowing in its pace or in its excitement. As an adult I thoroughly enjoyed this film but I feel for children it must achieve the delighted height of the early Harry Potters plus some. J.K.Rowling's mind is the most creative of any author, and now, screenwriter.The criticisms of the digital production are beyond me, as are any criticisms of the acting... I think we all know by now that the performances of Eddie Redmayne and Colin Farrell are no less than stellar every time. Alongside this I was pleasantly surprised by one perfectly apt addition to the voice cast, in Ron Perlman.All fits incredibly snug in this movie and its a true 10/10 for me because although the most pernickety among us will find one, or at most literally two, of the minutest details to fault, I review anything put before me at its very end. I judge it by the satisfaction I come away with and actually I came away with every bit of satisfaction and enjoyment from this film that I ever envisioned I could."

The plot is inventive and subtle. I've watched the film many times and the little ways each character reveals themselves is so intricate and layered, and often humorous. They obviously love working together, crew and cast, whatever discomfort helps define the notes. The script is marvelous, the music is magical, the sets are beautiful, the photography exceptional. They've got up an ingenious cast. It's hard on me to have had my favorite films almost ignored by the awards ceremonies this year, but those contests are becoming more and more impossible to respect"
" Rowling Disregards the Age-Old Maxim That Even a ""Great Writer of Fiction"" Rarely Translates Into a ""Great Writer of Screenplays""----
",0.7783,0.7628,2017-09-23 00:00:00,6,"---Operating on the assumption that a ""winning team"" is always a winning team, the leading creative talent responsible for the Harry Potter films reassembled to produce this Potter-affiliated prequel---but with one major change: JK Rowling, herself, wrote the screenplay (rather than the very talented ""Potter"" films screenwriter, Steve Kloves). The result---for those aware of the maxim that a ""Good (even great) writer of fiction rarely makes a good writer of screenplays""---is as predictable, as it was avoidable: a meandering mess of a screenplay, with poor characterization, a too- broad storyline, and superfluous characters galore...---The fact that Rowling's screenplay made it --intact--past individuals (such as Mr. Kloves, credited as a producer on Beasts), who surely were aware of its serious shortcomings, speaks more, I believe, to the clout and power of JK Rowling (and collaborators' fears of offending her) than on anything else. Indeed, Rowling has, unfortunately, morphed over the years, from a serious writer of excellent fantasy...into a Twitter-addicted ""celebrity,"" with a serious interest in (and opinions, on) politics.... As we have seen (too many times) with actors who buy into their own self-importance, their talent usually suffers in the process....----Examples of poor (even absent) character development in the film abound: from the almost totally nonexistent ""backstory"" of the chief protagonist, Newt, to the overly-broad depiction of ""typical"" Americans---to (seemingly integral) characters who are introduced--- only to inexplicably disappear completely....Our introduction to Newtreveals to the viewer a largely self-centered and one-track individual,who is oblivious to those around himself--- to the point of treating the likable Kowalski character with contemptuous indifference (handling him roughly, for example, and showing not the least concern toward him for injuries he may have suffered). Absent are any discernible ""lovable,"" Asperger's-type traits--such as self-consciousness or a studied effort to please. Plot devices---such as flashbacks--that could have introduced more of Newt's history to the audience (and provided some emotional connection) are absent. Nor are we provided with any compelling reason for Newt's ""mission"" to the US (other than the lame explanation that one of his animals needed to be released ""in Arizona"").....It is thus very difficult to empathize with (or even like) the character--or become involved in his nonexistent ""mission""...----The other main protagonist in ""Beasts"" is Tina--who is introduced to us as a nosy, authoritarian-like, snooper, with an almost pathological need to be deemed ""in charge."" It almost boggles the mind that Rowling would have had her barge into the PRESIDENT'S office--after she ""arrested"" Newt for bringing unauthorized magical creatures into New York (having recently had her clearances for making arrests ""REVOKED"" by that same President)...In addition, the low-level nature of the offense, itself-- makes the character appear not only insufferably self-important---but utterly clueless..Boh the character (and actress who portrayed her) are stiff and wooden in Beasts (and not very likable ).....---I do not know how many Americans Ms. Rowling personally knows--or how much time she has spent in the US--but, judging by her portrayals of Americans in the film, I would say that her exposure to both have been minimal....Depictions of most of the characters are overly-broad and loud (with Brooklyn accents and slang in liberal usage). For her secondary protagonists, Rowling uses cardboard, 1930's-era film staples, such as the""Dumb-Blonde-With-Big-Heart-and-Hot-Body-Falling-For-The-Homely- Joe""(Queenie), and the ""Honest-Working-Stiff-With-A-Dream,"" (Kowalski). Despite the hackneyed characters, it speaks volumes that these two are the emotional ""stand-outs"" in the film (due both to the excellent portrayals by the actors---but, especially due to the fact that the character of Kowalski is the only one in the entire film whose backstory has been at least minimally flushed out; we both KNOW his dreams and motivations---and his inherent decency).... ---One of the most glaring deficiencies in the story, however (and utterly incomprehensible) are the ""disappearing"" characters. Take, for example, the ""editor"" of the NY Daily and his sons : quite a bit of screen time is used in introducing us to the editor (with the stereotypical ""underperforming second son"" attempting to be noticed by a father only interested in his super-star, Senatorial ""elder brother""). And WHERE, exactly, does Rowling TAKE these characters--or us? Not ANWHERE....After a bizarre and unnecessary, newsroom visit by the editor's younger son--who drags a family of anti- witchcraft activists in his wake, hoping to interest his father in covering their story in his paper--the editor's elder son, a senator, makes an exceedingly unlikely, non-senatorial put- down to one of the anti-witchcraft zealots (who is a repressed wizard), causing him to seek vengeance, by killing the Senator during a speech later that evening....And the younger son? After his relatively involved introduction as a very angry, sleighted, younger son, who believes that witches have infiltrated NY---he simply VANISHES FROM THE REST OF THE FILM. Other than a millisecond's brief shot of his face at the very end of the film---not a PEEP is heard from him again...WTH was the POINT of even wasting the celluloid on this character? ....Glaring script errors such as this are rarely seen in big studio films---even more rarely, in super-big-budget films...Again, a simply inconceivable--and elementary--basic storytelling error...----The musical score to the picture is lovely---as are the special effects. The ""magical creatures"" are...somewhat magical...although, perhaps not quite as inventive as they could have been. The depiction of different time zones and regions--only yards apart--within Newt's ""suitcase"" is a very visually appealing concept, as are the majority of lesser magical creatures in the speakeasy Newt and his three protagonists attend midway through the film....Together with the quintessential ""happy ending"" that audiences prefer, and fairly decent acting (especially by secondary players Logan and Sudol), the film is worth a viewing....However, if one is expecting Beasts to rise to the level of the HP films, you are bound to be disappointed, as the WRITING has failed this film---quite unnecessarily..."
" A Prequel to a Prequel
",0.0,0.9982,2017-09-21 00:00:00,8,"I'll admit, I watched the film a few times before rendering a vote, but I found it to be a decent entry in the ""world"" of Harry Potter. I am one that hasn't read the books but saw every movie and became a decent fan of it that way. If you've seen the films and paid attention to little details, ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" actually ties in pretty well. The problem is, many will miss that.This movie has a big cast, and several stories running through it. Some I liked, some I didn't. The story I could do without was the election one (with Jon Voight), it seemed to weigh the story down. I understand it was meant to expose an element, but it wasn't that necessary to do so in such a convoluted way. If they just nixed this all and took a few sentences to explain it instead, it would have saved 20 minutes of the film.I liked the story of Jacob (the aspiring baker) and how he happened upon Newt (played by Eddie Redmayne) and Porpentina (played by Katherine Waterston) and Queenie (played by Alison Sudol) and those 'Fantastic Beasts' - and 'where to find them'. The 'beasts' were okay, some very colorful, some not really fully realized as I would have liked to see them.Creedence (played by Ezra Miller) was a bit of a letdown for me -- maybe because of the unveiling wasn't ""dark"" enough of a creature for me, but a CGI puff of smoke and even before that, I was trying to get a feel for the character and was all over the place on it. I've seen scarier more threatening ones in PG movies and I think this movie needed a better one. And Creedence's story overall needed to be better fleshed out.The story that confuses folks the most is the one of Percival (played by Collin Farrell). This is why I watched the film a few times before it dawned on me that this is what will connect it to the franchise. When I finally 'got it' was when I thought this was a good prequel to a prequel.The 'Percival' story just got really bogged down and drawn out to get to the point - and I would think the die-hard Harry Potter fans got it immediately --in the end, and that was the unfortunate part. I would have liked more clues THROUGHOUT the film leading to the reveal at the end. Why? Because of those somewhat Harry Potter fans like me, it took a minute to 'get' -- but after I realized what was going on, I am looking forward to the next installment. What is it, I think..? Well (And warning -- here maybe a BIG SPOILER!!!)'Percival' wasn't really 'Percival' but ... the dark arts master Gilbert Grindenwald! Wow!!! If you're now still wondering who Grindenwald is, then I can understand why the whole thing is still confusing. However, what is important to know is that Grindenwald and eventual Hogwarts Professor Dumbledore have a huge...and I mean HUGE ... history before Harry Potter. This is an exciting prospect.I think this was an attempt to bring the Grindenwald/Dumbledore story into the Harry Potter franchise/world. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them"", introduced you to those that will be important to Harry Potter's world, but this now is their World. Don't discount this film. There are so many hints to what is to come. But ya gotta go through this first. And don't miss the'subtle' but interesting barb of the two competing best Wizardry Schools, one in North America, Ilvermorny and Hogwarts! Two Wizardry Schools?!?!? Wow! For me, this film is getting to some very excellent upcoming stories was longer and got convoluted than need be to get to (or understand for some) and made what could have been a really great film entry into the next side of the Harry Potter world, a longer one than need be."

I went in with low expectations and it was worse than I thought possible.Spoilers belowPlot-wise, almost nothing happens, but even what does happen is tough to follow. The main characters make non- sensical decisions. The characters have no chemistry although the movie tries to force relationships. There is one particularly cringe-worthy scene near the end consisting of a drawn out goodbye that just didn't need to happen. Just because you have the two main characters be opposite gender doesn't mean you need to pair them up. The 'fantastic beasts' in the movie were okay. Nothing truly fantastic though. There are a few cute and amusing moments, but they are overshadowed by how ridiculous the main character acts around them. This guy has been trying to save and protect magical creature for, presumably, years and yet he is incapable of keeping them secure and in order to recapture them runs around like an idiot breaking things? He's an adult, not a 10 year old trying to hide a puppy.Additionally, one of the ""creatures"" on the loose is apparently a human who has been traumatized. Uhhhhhh, kinda messed up to treat that character as less than human....and then just kill them and literally no one talks about this. There is no reflection on the part of the characters as to what just happened. It's just ""see!!! *Newt's* creatures weren't killing people - it was that freak"". Is that really the takeaway?

Newt is in over his head, and only by some quick thinking does he get out of it. And then there's the romance (sort of) between him and Tina, and that of Jacob and Queenie.So, is it a perfect movie? Yes...and no. The positives first. The acting is first-rate. Eddie Redmayne as the shy, almost Asperger-like Newt, is fine in his role. He's passive, yet shines when he has to and takes command. Katherine Waterston as Tina is fine, if somewhat bland in her role. Colin Farrell as Graves is excellent and Johnny Depp provides a startling cameo. He has only two lines, but packs menace into each of them. The other parts are well handled.In particular, Dan Fogler as Jacob and Alison Sudol as Queenie, a seemingly bubble-headed flapper, is nigh on perfect. Unlikely, yes, but perfect, and the ending sets up a possible reunion. His line to Queenie at the end--""I wasn't even supposed to be here...I wasn't supposed to know""--is touching and heartbreaking.The music is, at turns, sprightly, dramatic, and moody, yet never overpowers the movie. The direction is solid, and the period detail along with the mythical beasts is fine. The CGI--what else can you expect in a movie like this--is superb, yet never dominates.Now, the downside. There are plot holes--big 'uns. (A few spoilers ahead). Kowalski at the bank seemingly causes the disturbance and the bank manager thinks he's guilty of potential theft, yet no one ever comes around to question or arrest Jacob.As well, Newt wonders about Graves' origins, and at the end he casts a spell to reveal Graves' true identity. However, unless there was a scene cut out where even a little exposition is given about Graves, then something is amiss.New York is not as crowded as it should be. My mother grew up in the Bronx in the 1920's and she remembered it as being VERY crowded, but here, while there are a number of people, it isn't as packed as it should be. Cinematic license, I guess...but it stood out to me.There are a couple of other outstanding unresolved plot points--mainly the fate of the Obscuris, well acted by Ezra Miller--so perhaps they'll be addressed in the sequel. Overall, though, I found it a fascinating flick and one I'd definitely buy the DVD for."
" Great story
",0.6249,0.8778,2017-09-18 00:00:00,10,"MlFantastic Beast and Where to find them is directed by David Yates, who directed Harry Potter and the order of the Pheonix (2007), Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince (2009) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 (2010) and part 2 (2011). Which goes a long way as David Yates is very familiar with Harry Potter. This movie has a stellar cast of talented people. Eddie Redmayne, Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight, Colin Farrell and Dan Folger. The academy award for costume is well deserved. Look at how the costumes not only enhance the actors' performance in their gesture, moment, and posture. And the textures and colours of the 1920 costumes look at authentic and pleasing.Don't go to watch this film as you would a Harry Potter movie. I personally found this movie far more entertaining than Harry Potter movies. Go watch it. If you like it good but if you do not then..hey. it is okay."
" Excellent production design is not enough to save convoluted plot involving ho-hum magic world derring-do
",0.2668,-0.9693,2017-09-16 00:00:00,5,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is J.K. Rowling's first screenplay. Rowling's tale is a prequel to her Harry Potter franchise neatly set in a Roaring Twenties New York City. The production design is probably the best thing about the film and for those (like myself) who yearn for such nostalgic enterprises, one can remain glued to the screen until the film's climax, despite the limitations of a paltry script.In truth, Fantastic Beasts probably could have used a better appellation such as ""Much Ado about Nothing."" Until the convoluted plot kicks in, Rowling serves up a decent enough protagonist in the form of author/researcher/ magizoologist Newt Scamander (winningly played by Eddie Redmayne). He carries around a beat up briefcase which is a portal to a magical world filled with the aforementioned beasts. When the so-called fantastic creatures start escaping, Newt falls afoul of the Magic Congress of the United States (aka MACUSA), who have strict rules about non-magic people knowing about their secret world. A defrocked enforcer, a witch by the name of Tina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterson, in a part where there's little to do) tries to rehabilitate her position by bringing Newt in to answer to the Congress for violating their rules. Only problem is that his briefcase was inadvertently switched in an encounter with an ex-factory worker, the ""No-Maj"" Jacob Kowalski and Newt is unceremoniously released.Kowalski is the comic relief here and Rowling has some fun in contrasting the sophisticated Newt with the unkempt American. There is a rather good scene where Kowalski interacts with Newt's beasts after falling into the briefcase and emerging inside the magizoologist's world of wonders.Rowling gets into trouble by introducing too many antagonists and by the denouement we're thoroughly confused as to who we should be mainly rooting against. First there's Mary Lou Barebone, a no-Maj crusader against the magic world, who is reminiscent of the Temperance League fanatics from the Prohibition era. Barebone's main claim to fame is she's the abusive mother of Credence, a problematic teen who we'll get to in a minute.Worse is MACUSA's Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves, who blames one of Newt's creatures for killing prominent senator Henry Shaw Jr. Before you know it, Graves accuses Newt and Tina of conspiring with the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (another one of Rowling's antagonists who shows up much later), and the unlikely couple are sentenced to death. I'm not sure why Graves is so sinister but I suppose Rowling needs such a character to root against as a representative of rabid intolerance. No need to explain how Tina and Newt escape but suffice it to say, they do!Things get more convoluted when we find out that Credence is the host of an Obscurus, some kind destructive energy creature that wreaks havoc on New York City. When the MACUSA enforcers show up, they're forced to kill Credence as he's the host of the uncontrollable Obscurus. Newt somehow reveals that Graves is actually Grindelwald, who ends up arrested by MAGUSA, not before surprisingly objecting to their non- fraternization policy between Maj and Non-Majers.I couldn't help being reminded of the scene in the Wizard of Oz when the Good Witch Glenda puts everyone to sleep in the poppy field and a similar sequence of events happens here. With the Obscurus revealing its power to ordinary folk, Newt enlists one of his creatures to fly throughout the city, dropping a magic potion on all the inhabitants, erasing their memories and ensuring that the secret magical world will continue to remain incognito.Fantastic Beasts features some whimsical, romantic scenes between Tina's sister, Queenie, a telepath who falls for Kowalski, who ends up (with Newt's help) in opening up his own bakery store. Much more disappointing are the fantastic beasts themselves--seen in similar incarnations, in fantasy films, of the last few decades.Maybe it's a question of a lack of true stakes here or simply Rowling's inability to bring her tale to a fitful and truly exciting conclusion. See the 'Beasts' for the visuals and don't focus too much on the plot."
" Gentle and warm film full of subtle emotion
",0.5859,0.9775,2017-09-15 00:00:00,10,"I utterly enjoyed this gentle and non-standard Hollywood film. Non-standard in terms of a story and building up of characters but standard in terms of special effects. And this is why I actually enjoyed it: we are getting a story outside of the classical Hollywood hero-villain dichotomy, that is developing gentle characters that do not comply to masculine or feminine norm. I definitely recommend it but do not expect Harry Potter and any similar character here."
" A Fun Film, but only if you're familiar with the Wizarding World
",0.2846,0.9968,2017-09-14 00:00:00,6,"I really did enjoy most of this movie. I loved the four main characters, Newt, Tina, Jakob, and Queenie, and thought the movie probably could've been made around the four of them, but there were two side plots that felt completely out of place. They start the film with newspaper clippings on the disappearance of Gellert Grindelwald as well as stories on the New Salemers. None of this matters to Newt, who only wants to find Fantastic Beasts, as well as deliver one of them to Arizona. That's all well and good, but he gets entangled with the New Salemers, and later the MACUSA, the American Ministry of Magic. If you're unfamiliar with the Wizarding World, then a lot of this, especially the story of Grindelwald, might be confusing. I watched it with my father, who'd never seen the HP series (except the first movie, when it first came out), and he found it to be confusing. I found myself explaining the different spells and words to him, as well as explaining who Grindelwald was because they just never explained it very well. The same goes with the New Salemers. All we know about them is that they're super religious and anti-witch/wizard. The New Salemers felt like a cliché and were just put in for Tina's demotion from Auror to make sense. There was a lot of this that I did like. I really wish they'd spent more time on the actual Fantastic Beasts. The 1920's time period was absolutely delightful, especially with Muggle/No-Mag Jakob experiencing everything for the first time. I don't think the story was completely thought out, and it could've been a lot better. But, still fun for fans of Harry Potter. I really hope they clear up all of the questions in the second film."
" Terrible
",-0.4767,0.898,2017-09-11 00:00:00,1,"Maybe I'm just prejudiced because I saw and enjoyed all the Harry Potter movies, but I found Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them to be a total bore. The filmography is okay, with good angles and a clear picture. My issue comes from the storyline. I appreciate the idea of trying to bring the wizarding world to America, and to New York, but the whole story is extremely tedious and boring. I'm currently still watching it; I'm not even halfway through and I think I'm going to discard it. The magic is gone."
" Potter world meets Dr Who (fun questions)
",0.0,0.8041,2017-09-05 00:00:00,5,"Was it just my imagination or did this look more like a Dr Who special? The actor looks like he could play a young Matt Smith, and the bow tie and scarf just scream Dr Who! As for the suitcase - well it's bigger on the inside (sound familiar?), also the muggle companion strikes a chord. Maybe I just watch too much Dr. Who and not enough Potter."
" Trying to function in the no-mag world
",0.0,0.9795,2017-09-04 00:00:00,8,"As I expected, the reviews of this movie are extremely binary. Some people liked it to loved it. Others hated it to one degree or other.I unreservedly fall into the first category. It isn't a perfect movie. Few are. But it's imaginative and fresh. We begin with a world that we're familiar with. We understand the wizarding and muggle/no-mag worlds. The script can be imaginative and original without having to justify anything that happens or explain its context. The audience already expects such activities.Certainly the plot isn't fresh. It's ground has been trodden many times before. But that's part of its charm. The world is familiar and the plot is familiar, so Rowling could take her wizarding world and make an entirely new story unconfined and unconstrained by the monumental Harry Potter history. Perhaps it was written for a slightly different audience. After all, Rowling is likely feeling very limited as a writer if all she is allowed to write is a continuation of a story that she has already told. The universe she created is diverse and complex. She should be allowed to explore it from other points of view.I do wish that the marketing of the movie had been less reminiscent of Harry Potter. I applaud the relative lack of pyrotechnics in the movie and its more muted volume than most movies have these days. But from the advance publicity, I suspect that some people went to the movie with unrealistic expectations.So kudos to the movie and its fresh look at the wizarding world. I applaud those efforts, and the movie gets my ""thumbs-up"" from me."
" Boring, just boring
",-0.5574,0.3625,2017-09-01 00:00:00,4,"Let me just say that this film is nowhere CLOSE to the original 8 films. The storyline is so cliché you can tell the ending 30 minutes in. The romance between character was so forced that this part seems like it was written by a 10 years old who hasn't even touched a girl's hand. I will give credit to the graphics and the monsters since they are really realistic. But just like the previous Harry Poter movies, fights between wizards are practically cheap laser tag with almost no strategy involved."
" Worrying means you suffer twice
",-0.7096,0.7351,2017-09-01 00:00:00,10,"This is the first film of what is anticipated to be a multiple part film series (at least 5 films). It takes place in NYC circa 1926. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is in NYC from Britain. He is a collector of ""fantastic beasts"" and is attempting to keep them from extinction and use said creatures to instruct wizards about them. While in NYC he runs into difficulty and finds himself at odds with an Obscurial (a young powerful wizard who use the dark force) and Mr. Graves (Colin Farrell). He allies himself with Tina (Katherine Waterston) clearly a future love interest, Queenie (Alison Sudol) a mind reader who oozes with Luna Lovegood simplicity and a likable human (Dan Fogler).There are a few things to note, one is the differences in culture and slang between the US and English wizards. The names lack the astrological significance as the Potter series. The magic words also appear crude and unlike English words made to sound Latin. There is a single reference to Transfiguration Professor Albus Dumbledore. He was famous for his defeat of Gellert Grindelwald. This is part of the background for the film.On the surface, the film appears to have let loose the special effects people and then create a film around it. Newt Scamander starts off as a low key character devoid of the personality normally associated with Rowling's characters. All this should change with the next film."
" Amazing.
",0.5859,0.9734,2017-08-28 00:00:00,10,"Well, I can't understand how people can rate this movie with less than seven out of ten. Starting with the story, I really loved it, the idea of writing something before the Harry Potter's legacy was pretty nice. The magical creatures were lovely represented. I really enjoyed all of this movie's things. The acting was excellent too, I can only say congratulations to all of the parts that made this project carry on. Please, don't underrate this movie because of the bad reviews that you've seen, in my opinion they are not correct. Enjoy the movie."
" Fantastic Derp And Where To Find Derp
",0.5574,0.9147,2017-08-27 00:00:00,6,"I tried to enjoy it, but I didn't find much to enjoy myself. The character who gets accidentally embroiled in the situation is the most interesting thing in this movie. I'd rather follow him than the mumbling lead.The other characters are barely memorable, plot is incredibly so-so. An extra star awarded for Johnny Depp being in something that isn't made by Tim Burton, even if his screen time in this instalment was barely a minute long.Check it out, a lot of people like it, maybe I wasn't really ready for it or had Harry Potter on my mind but for me it was simply ""meh"". Not overtly bad but not overtly good either."
" Goes stale very quick.
",0.0,0.8757,2017-08-23 00:00:00,3,"Gets off to a good start but just doesn't fulfill its promises. Eddie redmayne plays what an American teenage girl would view as a typical clumsy bumbling charming English man, this takes a lot away from the character and thus the story line. The film seems to focus too much around the will they won't between Tina and newt, this also takes away from the story line quite a bit. Jacob is introduced as a somewhat idiotic sidekick and never gains much more status that just the comic sidekick, a shame as Dan fogler has a fantastic acting range that is far from reached during this film. Graves played by Colin Farrell has the potential to be a very interesting character and is one of the only good casting choices that were made, he's secretive and sinister but again the film rips up its foundations only to replace him. Fun for kids but wouldn't recommend if you are looking for cinematic brilliance."
" Shows American Wizards as the AH's we really are
",0.0,-0.9937,2017-08-18 00:00:00,7,"I would have rather seen the British locale instead of New York. They showed what kind of people we truly are. I don't like David Yates directing. He may be everyone's friend on the set but he is also the director who cut off the Dursleys on HP changed the endings & filmed the half blood prince in Yellow lights.The best director would have been Chris Columbus who did the 1st 2 HP's and was faithful to every aspect of the books. He set the standard. It would not have been such a great series of films if Columbus had not directed the 1st two films. I wish he could have directed them all.Yates allows the DP to swoop past everything so fast, we can't enjoy or appreciate the background details & props of the wizarding world. If not for the pause button, I never could have read the alert meter. Without the DVD extras, I never could have seen the carvings. Same goes for the wonderful international costumes they failed to show us. The only Macusa magic features were the 2 house elves, the alert clock & the animated messages.While the actor portraying Newt looked like a match for his role, on several occasions he had an inappropriate smirky grin which did not go with the scene or dialogue. His facial expressions did not match the scenes. He was not believable in his delivery. Only his appearance fit the role.I did not care for the character Tina in any respect. I did not like her role, character, the plot or her acting. Nor did I care for Macusa. The building or the people. Nor the story line & the stupidity involved in the characters, carelessly & incompetently losing animals. It was written & filmed like a vaudeville slapstick comedy full of stupid AH Americans. Being one myself, the recognition is unmistakable.Then we had the death pool. Who would keep something like that at the Ministry unless they held frequent executions. Not to mention the sickening grins & patronizing attitudes of the 2 women trying to put them to death. As if they were enjoying the task of killing fellow wizards. And where was their wizengamot trial? Then the Macusa president orders the death of a child for violating rules they never went to wizarding school to learn. Since when are children executed & without a trial. The plot of the Senator also did not fit.There was also that ridiculous, offensive breeding dance by Newt which we could have lived without. And the repeated escapes of a niffler because the word ""Reparo"" wasn't in Newts vocabulary. He also didn't connect as compassionate toward his creatures. He was very lackadaisical & unconcerned about them. Not to mention not securing the case to keep them from harms way. Since when does an expelled student have a wand or be allowed to disapparate or perform magic? Yet, expelled Newt does all these things.It was one thing to use a tri-wing design on one creature, but the same wing design on 2 was absurd (Thunderbird & Occamy.) Not to mention the similarity to a hippogriff. I liked the creatures & efforts but not their lack of diversity. Some creatures were quite neat but we barely saw them. The plot was awful & poorly written. A shock for a Rowling novel. I agree with the actors about the utter waste of money creating real props for drawers that are never opened. Millions are being wasted. However, the saving grace was the characters Jacob & Queenie and the actors who played them. They stole the show completely. His giggle water scene was hysterical. As was the bowtruckles scene. Utterly enjoyable from beginning to end. I could have watched them another hour. They could have left Newt & Tina on the cutting room floor as they thankfully did for Jacob's prior girlfriend.Newt overdid the stumble bum persona & made his character too stupid to be a creature expert & too dispassionate to be a caretaker. His inappropriate facial expressions did not match the dialogue or situation such as grinning about not turning the swooping evil loose inside his suitcase house with Jacob. Or his total lack of concern when Jacob was bitten in the first place by his escaped animals, no less from repeated slap stick suitcase swaps & bad, unsecured luggage latches.However, the movie is worth watching just to see Jacob, Queenie & the creatures. Especially, the bowtruckle. Thankfully, the next film will be in the UK.But as with all her books, she always includes a wizarding villain; ad nauseam. They think we can't enjoy a movie or book without a nasty bad villain. There are other stories without ""evil versus good"" wars. She just cant let go of Voldemort & now Grindlewald.But this movie seems to unintentionally imply what happened to Dumbledore's sister. She must have been an Obscurus after the 3 human boys terrorized her. After seeing the power of Dumbledore's sister, Grindlewald went to seek one in the US. They haven't told us any of this yet, but I suspect they will. Ending the series in 2024 with the famous duel & the search for the deadly hallows.After 8 prior movies, I expected better from Rowling. I like the idea & creature plot but only the 2 characters & actors for Queenie & Jacob and their relationship. The actor playing Jacob was brilliant, endearing & funny. One of the best acting jobs I've seen in a long time. Queenie's performance perfectly complemented Jacobs. They made the movie worth watching. More time with the animals in the suitcase would have been nice & a better job of magicking the Macusa building would have been nice.Please bring back Chris Columbus to direct. You can have tea with Yates on your own time."

Should i expect in the next part of this movie, to see in the background JCVD (no disrespect intended ) running around like a blind bat with a gun in his hand?! i am just saying.... But as an overall it was a fantastic experience, (the Niffler was such a really cool dude) so thank you for this movie. P.S. I absolutely loved Colin Farrell in - In Bruges (2008).﻿"

Digital filter abuse is to this time as green gels and fluorescent lights were to the 90's and blue gels, bee smoke and Venetian blinds were to 80's.

The movie is so frickin' grey she couldn't make out what was going on for most of the movie and I kept reaching for the remote to adjust the color, tint and contrast. I'm guessing the design of some the creatures was colorful and 'fantastic' but by the time the Director got done desaturating everything you couldn't tell. To give you an idea, the Sun comes out at the end and even it looked washed out. It's also one of those 'whisper to explosion' movies so you have to ride the volume.I guess you can tell I have no comment on the film's content.

" Rating: B
",0.0,0.9992,2017-08-06 00:00:00,7,"I was never a hardcore fan of the Harry Potter's movies, but I did enjoy all of them, especially the last ones, so I was excited enough to get out and watch it in theaters. I have to say this right off the bat: you don't need to have seen the previous adventures of Harry Potter and his friends to watch this movie and that's something to praise!Every single prequel, sequel or spin-off always have some sort of bond to the first movie(s), but not Fantastic Beasts. They actually made an effort to achieve a good film without depending on the other famous story and heroes, this is a new start for a new (I hope, amazing) adventure with new characters, new spells, different places, rules and names (humans that were called Muggles are now called NoMag, for example).As for the story and characters, everything's just great. Eddie Redmayne does an excellent job portraying a caring, loving and vulnerable character like Newt. He's very likable and he's able to hide his past without it being too cheesy or lame. Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski is another perfect casting, he's hilarious and he basically plays us, an audience member. He doesn't know what's happening, he needs explanations about everything and everyone which doesn't really help the movie since there's a lot of exposition scenes, even if they're understandable for a movie that needs to set up a new world (like I said, it has almost nothing to do with the other one). Still, he was the reason behind the biggest emotional moment of the whole film and he's, for sure, the audience's favorite character.Another great surprise was the portrait of Tina (an investigator who's trying to figure out the mess that's going on in the city) by Katherine Waterston, she was able to capture that needed emotion on the right moments and was also a very likable character. Colin Farrell as Percival Graves was amazing, even if he doesn't appear that much. He was still connected to the biggest (but obvious) twist of the film.David Yates does a fantastic job as the director, he clearly understands this magic world like no one else and I hope he stays for the rest of the franchise. However, his editing team doesn't seem to be on the same page in terms of quality. There's a ton of CGI and editing mistakes and some cuts aren't that fluid. Another issue with this movie is the pacing: there's a lot of needed and cool character building moments, but there's also a lot of scenes that are just ... there. Every scene with the creatures is so exciting that, when we're not watching someone trying to capture one of them, the level of interest decreases a lot.There are some good twists throughout the film, but there's a lot of narrative issues like the ones I mentioned above. Heavy exposition scenes with Jacob, a lot of entertaining scenes that don't have any purpose for the story and all of this combined gives birth to a somewhat slow pacing. The villain is not something I really bought into it, but I guess I'll just have to wait for the next movies.In the end, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an enjoyable film, it's a showcase of the magic and creatures of this new world, it sets up a whole new franchise, but it's still a good movie (learn a little bit with this DC Comics). Great characters, excellent performances with perfect writing and a nice story to introduce us everything that's new. Some editing flaws plus a lot of exposition scenes and a pacing sometimes off brings the movie down, but still to an entertaining level.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Mentioning of Dumbledore twice doesn't make it Harry Potter
",0.0,0.8303,2017-08-03 00:00:00,3,"Why was this movie made? I really do not know. More money from the Harry Potter success, milking the cow? Did the American public need a Harry Potter style movie on their soil? For sure it wasn't to make a good story, because if there is something this movie lacks it is a descent and logical plot. Compared to the Harry Potter movies it is full of flat, meaningless and predictable characters and events. The magic duels never come close to the original movies. All the references to the original movies (*mentioning Dumbledore and Hogwarth once or twice) are meaningless and unnecessary and clearly only to make sure people do not forget it is a Harry Potter spin-offIt is not often I fall asleep during a movie...this time it happened...once...rewind...twice..rewind...and almost a third time but fortunately I was rescued by the end of the movie...well almost, I switched off the ""emotional"" ending"
" Not Bad for Rowling's First Movie Screenplay
",0.431,0.9973,2017-08-02 00:00:00,9,"As a lifelong Harry Potter fan since 1997, I was pretty excited about getting some more movies about the Wizarding World. It was even cooler that the creator of Harry Potter herself was going to write the script for the first Fantastic Beasts movie. That made me even more excited about it. I did enjoy watching the movie a lot.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them takes place in the 1920's during the Prohibition. The movie is about Newt Scamander traveling to New York for his research of magical animals. During his trip, a No-Maj (Muggle) named Jacob Kowalski finds out about Newt and his magical creatures. While trying to re-captures Newt's animals, they have to find out what kind of creature is attacking the non-magical community with the help of Tina Goldstein and her Legilimens (magic's version of telepathy) sister, Queenie Goldstein.The movie has a great cast. The best actors in the movie were Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, Colin Farrell as Percival Graves, Dan Folger as Jacob Kowalski, and Ezra Miller as Credance Barebone. I enjoyed their characters and performances the most. I can identify with Newt as a character because I'm also a shy person who loves animals. Also, the supporting cast of characters were also great.It was cool seeing more of the magical creatures of the Wizarding World than was shown in previous entries in the Harry Potter franchise. The animals were one of the best parts of the movie. Also, it was great seeing more of the magical community outside of the United Kingdom. I really enjoyed that and the 1920's setting.There were moments in the movie where I had a hard time understanding what people were saying which wasn't helped with all the loud explosions going on in certain parts of the movie. Newt Scamander was the worst offender because there were times where he was mumbling and I couldn't understand him at all. Another thing I didn't like about the first Fantastic Beasts movie was the twist involving the main villain. Even though I heard about the twist beforehand, I still didn't care for it.Despite its flaws, I still enjoyed the first entry of the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them spin-off movie series. The movie has a really good cast. The characters are enjoyable. It was great going back to the Wizarding World that I knew and loved for the past twenty years. JK Rowling did a pretty good job for her very first movie screenplay. Hope she keeps it up for the other Fantastic Beast movies. Can't wait for the next entry in this Harry Potter movie spin-off series."

Even though it may be an amazing thing for the fans it may not be that interesting for people who do not have any attachments to the series. The movie itself is very basic which falls short of making the viewers feel excited. Also, even though the ""beasts"" adds a nice lore, there is nothing more than them. Even there is other contents regarding lore they are not covered and it feels lacking. It may be done on purpose the create hype for future movies, however, I believe that it could have been more than that.

This is a sweaty, bestial movie that feels like last night's deep fried chips at a cheap eatery. Are you ready for a blob-a-saurus on heat in a blundering charge at a hapless human holding a vial of mating essence?It is grey, grey fog of blasted apartments. Your senses are doodled with by the spirits of Al Capone and his thugs. The chief characters seem to need to dampen their hankies at every scene.Visually it is a whoosh between old steel and mushy strawberries. In a truly sooty scene we witness loyal wizards slammed to their knees by Madam President. She orders magickal handcuffs to whisk their arms behind their backs. Madam is often pleasured by punishing those who serve the system in misty-eyed obedience. In a final rancid scene, this overseer of American wizards commands her gang to blast a much-abused boy into chinks of nothingness using the might of their gun-wands. This money-gurgler movie will spread underground slime for some years, with further editions rolling into 2024. Buy tickets if you like skinned knees. Return to Harry in re-runs paradise."
" This movie was no disappointment. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm glad that J.K. Rowling created it.
",0.4754,0.9813,2017-07-21 00:00:00,9,"This movie really brought joy into my heart as I was able to see the past wizarding world, and not just the Harry Potter era. The Harry Potter movies and books were amazing, don't get me wrong. I've read the series a total of seven times and I've watched the movies whenever I had a good 2-3 hours to spare. But the Harry Potter movies and books lacked the story behind the magic. Sure, that franchise included things with Grindelwald and some of Dumbledore's past, but not quite enough. Fantastic Beasts peeks at the wizarding world in America around 1926, way before the birth of the famous characters Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Watchers need to keep in mind that this movie is part of a series, so only a part of the plot is to be revealed. Also, if you are looking for a movie that is similar to Harry Potter, I must disappoint you. This movie is darker and has no magical school. I must disagree when people also say that the characters aren't likable. I've taken a certain liking to the main character Newt Scamander, and all the rest of the protagonists. There is an added bonus for those who are huge Potterheads though. You'll find yourself face to face with many references from the original HP series, like bow-truckles, Albus Dumbledore's name being mentioned, and more background on the dark wizard before Voldemort, aka Gellert Gridelwald (he was Dumbledore's childhood friend). You really need to be a Potterhead to understand a lot that's coming from Fantastic Beasts. Anyway, great plot, good characters, and beautiful graphics overall!"

I am sorry, but I have to admit I have no chemistry with any characters from this movie. I never read the book, therefore, I can't judge the original story. But all I watched this movie, the story is boring and plain. I will leave the movie in 20 minutes if there are no CGI processed. It is a movie built on CGI, the story itself is sadly empty.During this movie, there is only a few magic is needed, more like a magical background setting adventure story for kids. It made me miss Harry Potter, its plots are packed and trilling.Not so many things to talk about this movie, just some random thoughts below:First, the bad guys clubs, that supposed to be a very major person from the books according to other reviews I read online; however what I able to recalled from the movie about him are only the beginning newspapers warrant for arrest and the ending's exposure, and there is nothing else about this bad guy's bad history.Second, illogical love between the pretty younger sister and the no-maj. Third, Tina, the character just too pale and overacting, when I say pale I am not meaning to her skin, it is about her characteristic less role, simple head less thought and impulsively. Fourth, trust me the chubby no-man has better acting skills among all. And the main character, mr.nert? I knew he is a good actor, but I just can't find a favor from this character. Peace out."

One hour in I was still wondering what this movie was actually about because it was just unfocused. After that first plot was completed they suddenly switch the focus completely and throw in this random stuff that was mentioned in the beginning only as a side note.The effects were OK, but not enough to safe the movie for me.

" Mediocre Movies and How to Avoid Them
",-0.296,0.9992,2017-07-16 00:00:00,6,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is an American/British co-production from last year (2016) that runs for slightly over 2 hours plus roughly 10 minutes of credits. If you read the names of writer J.K. Rowling and director David Yates, you have possibly guessed correctly already that this movie takes place in the Harry Potter universe, namely roughly 70 years earlier, during the days between the two great wars of the 20th century. Fittingly, the visual style of the film reminded me of Boardwalk Empire on more than one occasion. So I guess they did a good job with making things look the way they were back then. But of course, in the center of it all is no gritty crime drama, but it is all about the fantasy. The world of magic is a taboo at that point and a secret society tries their best to keep it that way and to keep people away from finding out about the infinite supernatural possibilities that are out there waiting to be explored.This is where title character Newt Scamander comes into play. He is a young wizard traveling from Britain to the United States and we follow his journey involving new friends and creatures during these 120 minutes. He is played by Eddie Redmayne, the actor who won an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking not too long ago, and I must say I like him quite a bit. This is also why I am fairly disappointed how things turned out here. Despite playing the central character, Redmayne never really was given the opportunity by the script to show us his range. Some supporting players had better material than he did. Speaking about supporting characters, I was surprised how the biggest supporting characters were played by relatively unknown actors here, but hey, Rowling made Radcliffe and Watson famous, so maybe she wanted to do something similar here, even if the actors I am talking about are of course grown-ups already. I am not sure. Perhaps it would have been the better opportunity to choose established and famous actors for these roles like they did with Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman back then to mention just a few. Still I believe that these relatively unknown actors did a decent job for the most part. The core problems here are elsewhere. The one main problem is that the film keeps losing itself in visual effects on many occasions. And no matter how good they may be, they can never make up for lengths in the story and insufficient character development. This is also the aspect which eventually got me giving this film a thumbs-down and a negative recommendation.I do believe that this film is worse than all the Harry Potter films. Good actors are wasted for characters that are really not well-written at all and also do not make a lot of sense. Yes this especially refers to Colin Farrell here. By the way, after Gilliam's Parnassus movie (because of Heath Ledger's death), this is already the second time he plays the same character like Johnny Depp in a film. And here we have also already the possibly biggest surprise of this film we have here. They managed to keep Depp's inclusion (even if he is gone seconds later again) a secret. Depp, however, will have to do something really great in the upcoming movies if he wants to get this franchise on course. Yep franchise. Of course they are cashing in further with the Potter universe and there will be up to 5 films about Newt Scamander and his companions in the next years. Judging from the quality of this one here, I think one could have been enough. Oh well, there is certainly some irony to the fact that this one here won an Oscar, an achievement that none of the Potter movies have in their uncountable number of awards. Then again, I don't want to be any more disrespectful. The costumes were good I guess and it can be noted that a film can have great costumes and still come short overall with regards to everything else. Or lets say most other aspects. Of course the effects are strong, in quantity and quality, but like I said: To me it looks like they were used very much to make people forget about the lack of sufficient character developments and convincing story-telling. The introduction to the world and new city in the first hour was decent (so was the botched execution scene) and had the film kept that level, I'd certainly have reacted more positively to it all. But it did not. ""Style over substance"" is a fitting description and I suggest you watch something else instead. I must also say that this hardly felt like a Potter film to me. Apart from occasional references like Dobby, the film felt like a standalone movie, but maybe that's also because the story will go on for a long time still. Not a good standalone movie though. I truly truly hope the second film will be better.Correction: I liked it more on rewatch, so I will give this one an additional two stars and raise it from previously 4 to 6."

This film sets up a beautiful new world in a world that is very different from the one we were used to seeing in Harry Potter. Although some (like myself) were hoping we would come out feeling like we just saw another Harry Potter film, this is a completely different movie. The acting was great, the look and feel of the film was good, but a lot of the story was left untold or just moved too fast for the audience to truly grasp what was going on. But in the end I look forward to what is next in this new franchise, and unlike (the name) Kubrick, the name Harry Potter is what truly keeps this new series alive.Read more at theVade."

At first I seen harry potter and doing no looking into the movie I ordered it. And man it was great the plot is vastly different then the kids harry potter and it feels more adult for us kids who grew up with watching the movies and now are adults. The acting was great tho I did kinda dislike the 1920 NYC accent. But other then that I cant complain it was a wonderful movie and one I will share with my kids some day.

Multiple sequels are already in production, which assume this series will be another Harry Potter blockbuster. I had better things to do and walked out."
" It's no 'Harry Potter' but it still entertains
",0.6124,0.8902,2017-07-09 00:00:00,7,"We will never be able to capture moviegoers' excitement of, love for and connection with the 'Harry Potter' series, whether we're talking about the blockbusters or the books. This point should be understood in order to fully appreciate 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,' and even so, it's still hard not to compare it with its sibling series.To get it out of the way, it's true 'Beasts' has commonalities with 'Potter,' including the fact that the story comes from the pen of J.K. Rowling, takes place in the same universe (albeit a few generations earlier) and it's directed by David Yates (who also directed the final four 'Potter' films). But there is a lot more at the center of 'Beasts' than meets the eye.We're introduced to Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who arrives in New York City from London with a magical suitcase filled with...well...fantastic beasts. New York City has been under siege due to magical disturbances with notorious evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald at large, which gives rise to an anti-magic movement that forces the American magic community underground. After a chance run-in with a ""No-Maj"" (non-magical person/muggle) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and fellow magic person Tina (Katherine Waterston) in a bank, Newt and his newfound friends (along with Tina's flirty sister Queenie, played by Alison Sudol) are taken on a wild ride through 1920s NYC to capture escaped creatures while battling a sinister force in an ""obscurial.""Aside from the core cast, there are some other noteworthy castings in Colin Farrell as Graves, a high-ranking official from the American Magic Ministry, Carmen Ejogo as President Seraphina Picquery, Jon Voigt as a high-profile NYC banker and a bonus cameo from Johnny Depp himself. The cast are not the best part about 'Beasts,' though. The CGI has got an upgrade from the days of 'Deathly Hallows Part 2' in 2011, and the focus on all the crazy, creative creatures featured here makes this most apparent. Additionally, the score from James Newton Howard brings to life a lot of what takes place on screen.Again, it's not the best thing to come from the mind of J.K. Rowling, but 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is an exciting thrill ride through the magical world that we've come to know and love."

It was so slow getting started that I almost wanted to leave... then all the stories started to come together and the movie took off. Once it did, it was wonderful. Rowling seems to have spent 45 minutes introducing us to all the characters and the plot lines to the story. She did not rely on formulaic characters or stereotypes so it takes time to see them as they are. (Technically, we are now ready for four more movies without the need for any introduction). I loved this movie and thought it was a wonderful world to go to."

Similar to the Harry Potter series it seemed to magical and mysterious throughout, while giving a twist that was executed perfectly and I personally see it as a challenge to the Harry Potter series as it gave a unique experience that you wouldn't normally feel with this type of movie. The movie had a comic feel with distinctive ideas such as the ""beasts"" and I would definitely recommend a watch. Eddie Redmayne was perfect for the role as he portrayed a type of vulnerability while showing the independent wizard that he is. Dan Fogler's role as Jacob was played extremely well which helped to exaggerate the vulnerability of Newt and Jacob combined. the innocence of these characters is again exaggerated by the brutal, blunt face of Collin Farrell who at the beginning I didn't see as the correct character villain however as the minutes continued I grew to the character choice. Would definitely recommend a watch as this film is perfect for just about everyone."
" Confusing and a lost opportunity
",-0.1027,0.8694,2017-06-21 00:00:00,3,"Disappointed!There is a reason why, for example, music artists have a producer - it's hard to notice one's own faults, and the producer can to a much higher level see what can be improved and steer the project in the right direction. The same goes for films of course, and here is a film that is written and produced by the same person - J.K. Rowling. And my guess is that no one dared challenge her on this idea and how it should be written.The main problem is that the script is bad. It lacks character development. It lacks humour. It lacks flow. It lacks sharpness. It is confusing most of the time. On numerous occasions I found myself not understanding what I was watching. That is either explained by a very bad storytelling, or a sudden onset of dementia on my part. Who are these characters? What do they want? Why are they there? Why is Graves involved with some sort of orphan boy, looking for a special child? Who was this child supposed to be? I never found out! The idea is good, it's just not handled well. Rowling could have skipped that dark part of the story and just concentrated on the fantastic creatures and the fun things they would do. It lacks OUMPH as it is now.Another problem are the actors. Stiff, stale-faced people with no quirks or interesting personas. The only one I found interesting was Alison Sudol portraying Queenie. Great energy and charisma! She could go far. The rest, including the more famous actors, acted poorly to say the least.Sharpen up next time! (Hire me)"

It was actually very fun to watch it and good for spending extra time. The movie has very well-made visual effects and I could see how much money would've been spent on it. I had wished to have watched it in the cinemas. However, the plot proved it to be just one of those big-budget fantasy movie. So do not watch it for the story, I would say. The story line is very predictable and unoriginal, but I liked some scenes that were visually wonderful or humorous. It was also very interesting to see all the fantastic beasts that have peculiar characteristics- I wish there would've been more story about how he got them and what they are like. Overall, I did like the movie, and I would love to see the sequel of this one."

I'm going to respond to complaints with counterarguments. A big complaint is that Eddie Redmayne (Newt Scamander) mumbles most of his lines and doesn't make eye contact enough with the other actors. I've got an answer to that: Newt Scamander is meant to be a shy, socially awkward guy. When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense that he mumbles. You've met people that mumble. And the eye contact problem? His character is supposed to be a guy who connects more with animals than with any other person. He's not exactly used to talking to people.The next complaint is that the CGI is not perfect. Does it matter? Nope. Does it still support the story? Yes. Moving on.The last complaint is that there is no plot. There's a plot. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to summarize it. There are two stories going on at once during it, but it's still a plot. I hope the complainers found this useful, if they've even read through the whole review. They probably haven't."

The plot was a bit scattered to me the first time i watched it but then again its setting up more movies so it has to cover a lot. Despite what people said after watching it twice i completely understood what happened and can have a good idea whats coming next. Newt is by far my favorite characters in the HP universe now and idc what pottermore fanboys have to say about it. kawalski or however you spell it is an extremely funny character getting exposed to the wizard world and acted like many of us would and he portrayed the character very well.

But David Yates and JK Rowling managed to amaze me. I've seen someone saying that it's only a series of useless but fun facts that make this film long and with no story. So, indeed some parts can be debated. But you can't tell me that there's no story. To me, the plot is well represented and thickens throughout the film. The Harry Potter universe is entirely respected. The special effects are well done: it's just like we could adopt some of these strange animals to home, like a cat or something. Also, the acting is excellent especially from the main character (played by Eddie Redmayne). I won't write a novel to express my feelings. But I think that this film is a must see at least once."

There are so many plot holes and unqualified actors or actresses or the writer(s) are getting worse in film history now. This has cash grab written all over it. There is no depth in any of the characters or plots. Everyone and everything happens nonsensically. Johnny Depp has become too Hollywoodized in his acting roles after 2007 for my tastes.

I thought it was boring. I thought (from the title) that it would be Newt looking for fantastic beasts, you know, like the title suggests. Nope. There's another pointless plot line to the movie. I did like the characters for the most part. Jacob is a likable character and adds some comedy to the movie. It was nice to see some of the creatures mentioned in the books but the CGI was way off. This was a big budget film and the CGI looks like it's from 10+ years ago in some parts. I think the American 1920s setting doesn't really help as it makes this seem really far away from the Harry Potter series. I felt like it's running time was half an hour too long, which was a shame, I couldn't wait for it to be over as the plot was predictable. The characters actually in the main plot points I didn't really care about. Also I really struggle to understand Eddie Redmayne, he tends to mumble a lot!

But because I generally like whimsical stories, I found this one to be fairly entertaining. I like the creativity involved in putting together the 'beasts' of the picture, even if most of them looked like composite animals from planet Earth. Eddie Redmayne in the lead role of Newt Scamander was a bit of a puzzler though, in as much as it seemed like he reverse aged from his roles in ""The Theory of Everything"" and ""The Danish Girl""; I didn't know what to make of that. He actually did strike me as a teenager even though he's in his mid-Thirties, so more power to maintaining a youthful look as one gets older. Dan Fogler was good too as somewhat of a comic relief character and would be baker. Since I'm not up on the world of wizards, the story was a little confusing at times but I got the gist of it. In fact, I'd be up for a repeat viewing at some point, maybe before the next movie in the series comes out. Unless I get obliviated."

And some things (like the Niffler) are cute and somewhat amusing.The film does rely far too much on CGI creatures, which I suppose is understandable given the source material. Another reviewer said the first half of the film is like ""going to the zoo"", which is fairly accurate. Also, I thought the two child actors were pretty awful. Credence, who is a central part of the story, is just awful... really ruined the whole film. The albino girl was no better."

The movie takes place 70 years before the events in the Harry Potter books and we follow Newt Scamander, author of one of the books mentioned in the Harry Potter books and just as a reminder, Newt is the grandfather of Luna Lovegood's husband. But this is not the only connection with the Harry Potter books and movies, because let's face it, we Potterheads are going to watch the movie (besides the obvious) to discover those connectionsAbove all, the movie is pretty good. Comparisons are unavoidable but let's remember, magic or no magic, this is a spin-off, no Harry Potter in here! We are presented with a new set of characters, some where mentions less than briefly in some Harry Potter book but of course, we remember who they were. You can see J.K.Rowling writing in here (not as in Cursed Child, double sigh) and we must be grateful for that because we all feel like 15 years ago, really enjoying ourselves while watching the movie. For newcomers, this movie is a fantastic way to enter the Wizarding World that you have missing so far!On the other hand, there are some plot weaknesses, which we will obliviate ourselves because we were waiting so long for this moment that it doesn't matter. The movie might be found to be a big long (2h 20min approx), taking a lot of time catching the fantastic beasts meanwhile there was another subplot that in the future will be more important. Here comes one comparison: I had the impression that American wizards are more into action than British ones, but then we must remember something: in this film we see the adult society and in the previous ones it was the school society, so comparing them is like comparing Quidditch with Exploding Snap! There is more action, more magic, more explosions and more adult themes, but let's not forget that this movie is directed to your inner younger self.There will be 4 more movies to come to keep enjoying this new magical era and we are really intrigued to watch them because for once, we have NO reading material!!! Visual effects are one actor more of the movie, brilliant as always. To create all these creatures was a challenge that they did more than succeed as you will be fascinated with them and after leaving the theater you will be looking for the nearest book store to buy the book (if you still didn't have it!). As an extra,you will get goosebumps when hearing Hedwig's Theme; and if you don't, muggle/no-maj you!!Overall we are faced with a really entertaining movie that keeps the spirit of the previous ones. It has new lovable characters, new information for us to enjoy, and questions left unanswered that we hope will be answered in the upcoming films. We have until 2024 to keep enjoying tha magic."
" Couldn't see the movie
",0.0,0.3506,2017-05-27 00:00:00,1,"First off, I'm willing to admit that my rating might (maybe) have been higher if I had been able to watch the movie.Our son loaned us the BluRay/DVD and we settled down to watch the movie with no per-conceived ideas. We are not Harry Potter fans but did enjoy those movies. We did not even realize that this story was by the same author and in the same universe.Part way into the movie, we were debating whether our inability to see what was going on was due to (a) lack of lighting in 1924; (b) the director trying to establish a dark feel movie (unlikely based on the apparent subject matter; (c) a cover-up of poor/cheap CGI.In any case, we just gave up. We like to watch movies but we also like to actually see what is happening on screen.IMDb claims 4 more in this series. They need a new director."
" Everything I hate in a movie
",-0.5719,0.9728,2017-05-14 00:00:00,2,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is everything I hate in a movie – and then some. (I would have walked out if I wasn't with Marie.) The movie has 15 minutes of plot and two hours of CGI, most of which does absolutely nothing to do with the story or the plot. (""Mommy! MOMMY! I got a new CGI program! Look at all the fantastic beasts I've created! Can we hang them on the refrigerator?!"")That the movie wastes an excellent cast is also unforgivable. Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterston have little with which to work, but the screen comes alive when Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler (a Muggle, uh ""No-maj"") all too infrequently appear together. And, there's a tiny little cameo in the last scene of the movieThe good news is that the movie is 2:15 long, so I had lots of time to look through my pockets in hopes of finding something sharp enough with which to gouge out my eyes. And, to ponder how the actors must have felt spending endless hours on a green screen stage, emoting to a tennis ball. I felt especially sorry for Eddie Redmayne in the scene where he's required to perform a rumpant mating dance. (Don't ask)If you like the Harry Potter movies, you'll probably like this one. Otherwise, avoid like the plague."
" Haters gotta hate
",-0.7845,-0.9808,2017-05-13 00:00:00,6,"This movie seems like it's not enough for 180 million spent. But if you give it anything less than four stars, then you're either 1: a Harry Potter die-hard who is disappointed; 2. someone who hasn't seen enough movies to know what really is a bad movie; or 3. you just have no imagination.... and by no imagination I mean you have to stop whining about the character development.... or do all your movies have to be three and a half hours long? Suck on it haters."
" It was really good.
",0.4927,0.9527,2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"Meeting Newt Scadamander and exploring an unknown part of The Wizarding World are incredible. The best part of the movie is the screenplay which is written by Rowling. There was a huge difference between this one and the Potter films. I wish she would have written their screenplays, too.I have to say that Eddie Redmayne is the best choice for Newt. His performance was so good."
" Surprisingly boring and obnoxious
",-0.4767,-0.6753,2017-05-07 00:00:00,5,"It felt like the creators (?) literally said to each other, ""This is the Harry Potter world! People love this stuff! Let's just make sequences that go on and on and on. They'll eat it up! They won't care whether the participants do things that make sense or seem to have a single pair of functioning neurons between them!"" The particular failure is in the main character. Most of the time, Eddie Redmayne does one of two things: affects an obnoxiously clueless, staring leer as he passively watches events unfold around him; or listlessly chasing after creatures he can't possibly capture by hand, having somehow forgotten that he has wizardly ways of obtaining them without provoking them to destroy everything within a half-mile.Even the music was uninspired; but against the memory of John Williams, what isn't? Oh, there were good effects, and eye-candy sequences, and a few isolated moments of interesting characters. But the whole was far, far less than the sum of the parts.Just disappointing."
" What a waste
",-0.4215,-0.4517,2017-05-06 00:00:00,1,I am unhappy that I wasted 6 bucks to rent this. I did not even make it half way and was fighting to stay awake. I love the Happy Potter series - read all the books and say all the movies in theaters. I still rematch the movies when they are on TV. This is beyond disappointing. It has absolutely no redeeming factors - except perhaps that I did not waste even more money at the theater. I will never read or watch anything again by this author. This is trash.
" Horribly boring mess!
",-0.8172,-0.9469,2017-05-05 00:00:00,2,"I have NO idea why this movie has such a high rating. It was one of the worst big budget movies I have seen in years. And I VERY MUCH expected to like it a lot! Where to start? First off, none of the characters are well written or developed. The story moves at a very slow pace, and I normally like movies that take their time telling a story, except there is not really much story or plot here. The extreme over use of CGI, makes the movie unbearable at times, and the CGI is not even amazing or good, but looks like 15 year old CGI. VERY FAKE looking. The whole thing is just a mumbled jumbled mess. No story hardly, no interesting characters, and a blah look overall and tons of fake CGI. A borefest."
" Pretty to look at, but . . .
",0.2732,-0.3604,2017-05-04 00:00:00,5,"As the summary states this movie is pretty to look at, but that's about it. The story is incoherent and lacks focus, which results in a rather boring experience. The only believable character is played by Dan Fogler, who acts human and reasonable and is actually fun to watch. Maybe because he plays a muggle? The rest of the cast tries hard and I don't mind Eddie Redmaynes mumbling way of speaking, but they all have a problem with the non-logical behavior of their characters and the forced and not very surprising progression of events."
" Just average. Not fantastic
",-0.4449,0.3895,2017-05-01 00:00:00,3,"J.K Rowling, not content with having milked 'Harry Potter' for all it was worth (quite a lot as it turned out) has now decided to expand her 'wizarding world' with this sort of spin-off series.Sadly this first instalment isn't that fantastic, in fact it's lots of special effects holding together a paper thin plot that seems largely to involve poor Eddie Redmayne running here, there and everywhere trying to catch whichever creature has escaped from his suitcase next.There are moments, yes, when this film actually lives up to its billing, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes, but this was a load of old nothing really."

One item on the list is fantastic beasts and where to find them, by a fictional author. This movies takes place in the same year tom riddle was born. The next three movies will get closer and closer and most likely end in 1945 I believe. Was not meant to be a prequel but jk Rowling has changed that as of lately. We will see grindwald...we will see him go evil...we will see a younger dumbledore. All of the films should be about a 19 year timeline within the story. If y don't like it you don't like it...but understand why there was so much cgi. This is just the spark to an enormous backstory. Not to mention the intimate relationship between grindwald and albus which was completely diminished once he turned. Albus has never loved someone intimately since. This will help us better understand his nature in the Harry Potter serious. He has always known his destiny. And you will see why"
" Dark, Violent Movie - Not Appropriate for Kids or Adolescents
",-0.5994,-0.998,2017-04-29 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie tonight on RedBox and found it very disturbing and dark, especially in its treatment of children. It is much darker than any of the other Harry Potter movies. Also, its main characters are people in their late 30's (which doesn't add to the appeal for children or young adults). On top of this, it was also a boring, slow-paced, un-engaging movie until the last 15-20 minutes (which only somewhat redeemed the film), with CGI reminiscent of a bad video game. I do not have children, but if I did, I would not let them see this movie.*SPOILERS coming* I was not necessarily intending to write this as a review with children in mind, but I am very angry with the way this movie treats children. While some of the other Harry Potter movies are dark, none of them comes close to the evil in this movie. With the exception of the 4 main characters and the various children, every character in this movie is portrayed as self-serving and evil, with the majority of violence being done to children. Let me elaborate: there is the evil ""mother"" character who adopts orphans and then emotionally and physically abuses them (she beats and cuts them), and forces them to distribute anti-witchcraft pamphlets. There is the evil wizard (who turns out to be Grindelwald) who also emotionally and physically abuses a teenager and acts like a pedophile (he caresses the teenage boy's face, clasps him close, physically harms him, pretends to be his ""friend"" in order to manipulate him, and forces him to betray his own sister). The main ""dangerous creature"" in this movie turns out to be literally a demon from this possessed, tortured, abused teenage boy. How does the movie avenge him? It doesn't. In fact, the female witch president of the USA kills the boy because his demon ""accidentally killed a no-mag (muggle)."" On top of these very dark themes, there are also inappropriate sexual moments. This film is clearly directed at adults, and not at children or teens. A female character is shown in lingerie, seductively dressing in front of two men she's just met. A disgusting and prolonged CGI scene shows what is basically a sexually-charged magical rhinoceros with a glowing red organ who spends about ten minutes trying to ""relieve itself"" on one of the human characters. There are other sexually suggestive moments involving men eyeing a woman's cleavage.I also did not find any of the characters to be likable except for the Polish guy who wants to start a bakery. He is truly likable. Okay, in the last 10 minutes or so I also liked the witch Queenie, too, and I thought the way the movie ended was one of its few redeeming qualities.Last of all--toward the beginning of the movie is a long CGI segment clearly intended to showcase all of the 'magical' CGI animals designed for this movie, but it involves poor Eddie Redmayne squawking like a bird and--I kid you not--trying to do the mating dance of a sexually charged magical male rhinoceros.A very strange, dark movie. I only like the ending."
" Saturated With Illuminati Themes & Satanic Symbolism ~ Fantastic Beasts Is Clearly Pushing A New World Order Agenda
",0.743,0.6644,2017-04-28 00:00:00,1,"This is not just harmless entertainment. It is intended to steer the the uninitiated masses thought processes and spiritual beliefs.The character of Mary Lou Barebone who denounces black magic as wrong & harmful, is depicted as an abusive zealot. Although it is never explicitly stated that the character is a Christian, it is very heavily implied. JK Rowling is known to have a longstanding hostility towards Christians and Christianity.This film is not something young children should be exposed to because it is jam packed with occult references and impressionable minds are likely to be influenced by the positive portrayal of occultism and not recognize the proselytizing intent. This material advances an anti-Christ worldview.The twisted message Fantastic Beasts gives to impressionable children is...'yes the demonic does exist but it is not wrong or dangerous, it is good fun & anyone who says otherwise is evil.'Making potions and casting curses or spells on other people (witchcraft) is presented as good when in reality it is not. I expect to get a lot of down votes for this review because unfortunately people will always excuse this franchise."
" wonderful addition to Wizarding world...beware Spoilers
",0.5719,0.9972,2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic Beasts and where to find them, proved to be a wonderful movie and the latest chapter in the Wizarding world of JK Rowling,. This one set in the JAZZ age US 1926 sees magiczoologist Newt Scamander come to US on a mission to find a new animal for a birthday present for someone (Leta Lestrange? Dumbledore). A comedy of errors ensues as bags get swapped, eggs get laid, beasts run loose, and the shambling outsider, more at homes with animals than with the most vicious creatures on earth: his fellow humans; brings mayhem and finds what looks like true love! But not before getting arrested by a down on her luck Auror, Tina Goldstein,demoted but hopes to get her old job back . Meanwhile some strange force is at work causing chaos and fear in NY. New acquires new friends who work to recover his animals and uncover the mystery of the strange force. Fantastic Beasts proves to be a wonderful addition to the canon by Rowling, who may not know much about Syria; but knows how to write an engaging story with wonderful characters. 4 of the lead characters are quirky, each a little out of joint with their lives, while a fifth has a dark agenda. Unlike the Harry Potter series, FB takes place with characters who are mature wizards and witches, so magic is carried out with abandon and casually. The Goldstein sisters magic plates and food at a meal; character apport (teleport) here there and anywhere, except into MACUSA HQ. While we learn Queenie Goldstein can read minds (legilimens) with ease. (very useful for blackmail) An article has compared FBs wizards and witches to the Marvel and DC superheroesthe former being more human and humane and the latter: militarised supermodels. Its Dr Who vs Star Trek for 21st century. A whimsical dinner shows us the 4 characters with their foibles looking anything but super ; with sister Queenie holding a one sided conversation with wannabe baker Jacob (Can you stop reading my mind for a moment) Kowalski, while the more prickly sister Porpetina (aka Tina): cautious curious and fearful and Newt look liking ill at ease, and wanting to be somewhere else. As the story proceeds, the 4some are drawn closer together, and a near shared execution at the hands of the mysterious mr Graves (about whom Newt has growing suspicions) drives Tiny and Newt together as both then go on the run; 'Mr Scamander' being replaced by ""Newt' and a visibly less officious and more relaxed In the midst of all the marvelous magic hocus pocus and animal hi jinks, there are 2 surprising sets of love stories, with Queenie and no-maj Jacob on the short axis and Newt and Tina on the longer one, needing that most potent of plot devices: an execution, to catalyse the relationship . The final scenes show clearly the sisters unwilling to let their men go, but we till have to wait till part 2 to know how they are brought back together. Alas i can only give it 10, as i enjoyed this even more than the harry potter stories"

Her realities are more real than ours in that the multitude of details is exquisite. Enter Stuart Craig, the person responsible for set design. Even if you were not a committed Potter fan like I am, the film is amazingly beautiful and the plot presents a good mystery story."
" Fantastic CGI, but not so fantastic story...
",-0.5739,0.9941,2017-04-24 00:00:00,3,"Not being a fan of the universe that Rowling created and not much of a fan of ""Harry Potter"" as such, then I had very little interest in watching ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" actually, but I had the chance and went to watch it with my wife.And while she found it to be a good movie and enjoyed it, then I was in the opposite side. I didn't enjoy ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" one bit.Sure this movie was amazingly great and astounding to look at visually. And believe you me that there was not spared on the special effects and the visuals in this movie. The CGI effects in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" was off the charts. And that alone is almost enough to make it worthwhile to watch the movie, almost...What deterred me was how the was the amazingly boring storyline. It took forever for nothing to happen, and that was a massive anchor around the movie, dragging it down to the point where it became unbearable to witness.It seemed like the entire movie was just a stream of random scenes put together, in no particular order, for making a complete movie. There was a disturbing lack of a red thread throughout the course of this movie.As for the acting, well they surely had managed to get some great names and talents along for the ride, but the pick for the lead role was a bit beyond my comprehension, because Eddie Redmayne seemed to be as lost in the story as the rest of the audience. He stuck out like a sore thumb among the likes of Colin Farrell and Dan Fogler.I walked out on the movie shortly after 50 minutes into the movie, when the main character started to do a mating dance. That was just the pinnacle of ridiculousness and I tossed the towel in the ring at that point. It was just too much.I am sure that there definitely is a massive fan flock for this movie, given the success of the ""Harry Potter"" movies (and books), however it was just a swing and a miss for my part."
" Looks like Men in Black in Vintage style

The movie is Good, but I don't fill anything new, and look I am watching ""Men in Black"" in old classic look. I don't read the book yet, so I am not judging the book. I think today's book writers when they write, so they think about movie point of view. At last overall movie is good but not as I expected."
" Well...that was disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.982,2017-04-23 00:00:00,3,"Let me start out with why I was really excited about this film: I am in some ways Eddie Redmaynes character. In fact, I watched to film on a plane back from researching wild animals in Africa, so you can imagine the idea of (finally) getting to see all those amazing magical creatures of the HP universe on the big screen was quite something to look forward to for me. why didn't I go see it in theaters you might ask? well because the trailer already showed that it didn't have much to do with the title in my opinion. the idea of these animals in the most bleak New York I have ever seen instead of the lush green grounds of hogwarts (not that it had to be hogwarts, but green) was not very enticing, but on the plane, I decided to watch it none the less.So here goes: Eddie Redmayne is a good actor, we have had proof of that, and while he has done some truly terrible work too (Jupiter Ascending), I did not mind his acting here at all, only that it was a terrible character. Sure the: animals over humans mentality is to be expected, and quirky is an ever present character trait in JK's work....but a straight up ""shut in"" who never once makes eye contact with his partners in crime, but is somehow expected to build relationships with them? yeah....not someone I would choose as a main character. Not to mention that, for all those who are familiar with Doctor Who....his entire character is almost an exact copy of Matt Smiths version of the British doctor. Has an unexpected ""hideaway"" that is larger on the inside....bowties, over large shoes, and just a weirdness about him, that, if his passion shows makes him very endearing....only that that passion only appears two times in the whole movie. Really not happy about this (and MS is my favorite doctor)about the rest? yeah so I am sure there were more colors than grey in old NY....also I doubt everything and everyone looked that clean and neat. A problem you often get in old representations of NY, like in King Kong, and even the final scene in Sleepy Hollow....but that does not make it excusable! it makes the animals seems even more out of place than they already are, and adds no interesting setting for any of the story. a large winged snake in a dark attic just isn't as fascinating as it would be in a tropical forrest! The Animals as a whole were a disappointment. lazy copies of existing and slightly changed real creatures most of the time, with no explanation or sometimes even the name. the ones in focus for the character even have very little appeal to them. a kleptomaniac echidna, and a wird reptile-bird that is almost a deus ex machina (even more than the deus ex machina that frank becomes in the end, if you want to find a cool way to obliviate NY in one go...ask MIB2, they did it right). overall, as a researcher of animals, I found it heart breaking that once again, the animals were only a ""entertaining"" side note"" in a movie that supposedly dealt with them.Which brings me to the plot (for anyone who is still reading). Would it have been so hard to make one of the escaped creatures the thing that Grindelwald wants to use against...well....we don't know against whom. We know very little about his interests from the last few HP books, and this film does nothing to tell us more. The actual idea of the dark power within a suppressed wizard could have made a great stand alone film...but sadly it was the main idea in a film that was supposed to focus on something else. and since this is getting a bit long, let me (only) mention two more things about this film: the wizard government of America might be the only one that is worse than the actual government we currently see over there....seriously...incompetent, violent, and....just just awful!!! and last but not least, the biggest sore on the ass that was this movie: Johnny F*cking DEPP!!! believe it or not...but I found Colin Farrel to be perfectly cast as a disguised Grindelwald....but oh man what a waste. not only do we know nothing about his characters motivations other than: power and destruction....but sacrificing any information for the ""shocking"" reveal in the end is ruined by A) the strong emphasis on Grindelwald during the intro means he has to appear somewhere B) Colin was the only villain, so of course it was him C) if you show the back of the head of the secret villain in the first scene....don't follow with the back of the head of the villain in disguise with THE EXACT SAME HAIRCUT!!! was I the only one who found that very obvious? and D) (felt like the movie giving me the D here)....Johnny Depp is the worst choice possible. an actor once hailed as great on a steady decline into ridiculousness. any movie loses all credibility in my head nowadays for casting him....and this one is no exception. more so since it tries to make it the ""twist we all wanted"" that we really didn't. sad to no longer see colin in this project, who knows, he might have saved it."
" Nothing Like Harry Potter
",-0.2755,0.5597,2017-04-23 00:00:00,4,"I have to start off by saying, I absolutely love the Harry Potter films!! I have watched them all probably over 100 times, I can quote the entire first 5 movies while on. I have shirts, shoes, a hat, and even a wand. I love the films, especially since I grew up with them. The beginning of the movie is sort of entertaining, but the movie is not and will Never Be Harry Potter. I wanted that ""Harry Potter Magic"", but this movie was nothing like that. Put it this way, if this film came out before Harry potter, then those films wouldn't have done as well. I honestly believe this would have killed the Potter fandom before it became a thing."
" I love the HP world, but this piece has poor script, weak direction and video-game-like CGI
",-0.7506,-0.6122,2017-04-23 00:00:00,5,"I have been a tremendous fan of Harry Potter since the first book and movie. When I say tremendous fan, I mean I read all books many times, cried at some points, watched all movies many times in the theater. I was excited to see a story of Harry Potter's world in the theater again. I was not expecting much and, even then, I was disappointed. The script is weak and the direction doesn't add anything to it. My overall feeling was I was watching a very childish film. The plot is predictable, the jokes are not creative. Also, the CGI is so unnatural that I thought I was watching a video game at many times during the film."
" An Ambitious, if Narrow, Compliment to Potter's World
",0.7351,0.9849,2017-04-19 00:00:00,5,"JK Rowling's new Harry Potter world-extension isn't so much a prequel as it is a loose, distantly relevant novella. People wave wands and use familiar lingo. Footnotes from the wizarding world take flesh and form out in the wild and there's a bit of familiar name-dropping to keep us all invested. Eddie Redmayne takes top billing as the introverted naturalist with an extensive collection of traveling wildlife, but as the name implies, the beasts themselves are the real stars here. A live-action jaunt through the monster manual, it's an interesting, unusual turn if not a terribly fulfilling one. Many times, I felt like I was digging through the guts of an info-rich companion book and not a free-standing tale. There's the framework of a story, of course, but it's awfully dry, light fare and the real focus is quite clearly on establishing a deeper lore for the growth of the franchise. The effects work is strong, as it desperately needed to be, and I enjoyed the unexpected aesthetic of magical society at play in the roaring twenties, but there isn't a lot of meat on these bones. Disappointing, since the Potter films are brimming with precisely the kind of depth, warmth and rich, implied back-story that this is missing."

A huge focus on the protagonist leads to underdevelopment of the main villain. The movie ends in a whimper when compared to the initial build up.You won't even feel frightened from the main villain who goes off as quickly as he comes. On the positive side, a huge production budget lends to gorgeous animations. You are able to see many of Rowling's creations come to life. Its a fun to watch how they are unique in their own respect with magic complimenting their personalities.Watch the movie just for these Fantastic Beasts and hope that the sequels are able to do justice to the series."

",0.0,0.8445,2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Or is it a long time has passed? As you probably know already without me having to point it out, this is based on a book by the Harry Potter writer (even in the movie there are references). I haven't read the books (I know shame on me), so I can't compare anything from Potter books or this in specific.What I can tell you though, is that this has great special effects. And a really neat story to carry too. Is it predictable? Yes of course it is, painting peoples characters pretty easily. But while people claim this to be more of an adult version of Harry Potter (and there is some light violence and death), this still can be called a kids movie. It's an adventure for everyone sort of. You can actually enjoy this without thinking too much. There is so much visual stuff in there, that your mind will be opened"
" Cat and Mouse, Niffler and Newt
",0.0,0.9934,2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"An interesting idea from the world of Harry Potter is that wizards could possibly exist parallel to our reality. You can take that world with you and throw suspicious eyes to previously innocuous things. Discarded coffee cups could be port keys. Strung-out homeless people, holding passionate conversations with themselves, could be talking to a great witch or wizard with a concealing charm that we mere muggles can't see. Their private world is such a marvelous amalgam of centuries past that it translates effectively regardless of whether it's 1920 or 2020. What ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" brings is a stunning marriage of the eccentric wizarding world, and New York during the roaring 20's. More than simply changing the venue to a different nation, FB (we are now using this shorthand, word count be damned) grows the fantasy without losing the familiarity of Rowling's brilliant series.One of the greatest elements of this setting is the preexisting climate that parallels the wizarding world. So much of New York's society in the 1920's was underground. The laws dictating temperance and gambling made for an underworld so iconic that it comes to mind, today, much quicker than the standard lifestyle at the time. Think back to when Harry took his first trip to Diagon Alley, through the back of a pub, to the brick wall, a secret knocking sequence opened you to that amazing world. All the best nightclubs in New York in 1926 worked the same way. Between these two subcultures, everything in the margins of the setting holds something astounding.A small concern I had before going into FB was how much time they would take bringing the audience up to speed. As it turns out, virtually zero. If you have no knowledge of the world of Harry Potter prior to seeing this movie, you will unfortunately be lost. For those of us who have devoted a shameful amount of time to accruing Potter knowledge, it's appreciated to get into the theater and hit the ground running. The familiar John Williams score brings us into the cobblestone streets of New York before we get our first glimpse of dark magic. Graves (Colin Farrell) investigates the Nomaj (muggle) streets after a dark force has destroyed half a block. Graves is a Tim Burton wet dream, all black and white without a hint of grey. Based on what we know of the title, a beast is loose. Soon an awkward Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) docks off of Ellis Island wielding his Mary Poppins case that bumps and squeaks with life. Redmayne has a great way of being both boyishly innocent and obliviously selfish in his pursuit to acquire his beasts. He has a one track mind and doesn't seem to have much regard for collateral damage. How he accomplishes this whilst remaining likable is (adjective pending.) The climate of the city is tense. The magical community is up against a Salem-like resurgence of anti-witchcraft evangelicals. Newt couldn't have arrived at a worse time. The Nomaj community's blind fear of magic is paralleled by the magical community's ignorant fear of magical creatures. Newt, obviously, becomes a suspect for the havoc wreaked in the city, and the rest of the film is a whirlwind of cat and mouse, niffler and Newt.We are introduced to many creatures and characters that I won't spoil, but there are two actors who deserve high praise for bringing a level of joy to the feature that makes FB endearing. Dan Fogler as the Nomaj Kowalski, adds beats of humor that are easy to overlook. With Redmayne playing everything straight, the comic relief is necessary but requires Fogler's discipline. The other is Alison Sudol as the witch, Queenie. Sudol is contagious in how much fun she has with this role. Queenie is the perfect complement to Kowalski's fish out of water Nomaj. Their dynamic with each other and as supporting characters is the highlight of the film. The Harry Potter films matured into some truly dark territory that FB doesn't quite venture, but the more kid-friendly feature doesn't feel overly precious. The mysterious antagonist and conflict may grow too far into the absurd for its own good, but how it all fits into the beloved world doesn't give the impression of a spin off cash-grab. The hunger for all things Potter is insatiable and the inevitable sequels to come have an admirable bar to hit."

" worse than Harry Potter
",-0.4767,0.461,2017-04-15 00:00:00,1,I never liked Harry Potter except the 3rd and the 4th movie.But this is far worse.Don't see it.It is a waste of time and money.No story just visual effects.How do they convince people to like these movies??As i have heard there will be more movies like these.Thank God i didn't see it in cinema.I stopped it after half an hour.J.K.Rowling is not a writer!!
" 8/10 I really enjoyed this movie. I loved almost everything.
",0.8173,0.9853,2017-04-15 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The special effects were incredible! The story was great, the characters were great. I loved the creatures and the world they live in. I thought it fit very well into the Harry Potter world which is important as does take place round that world. I also really liked how we saw a different side of the wizard world than before. And how different the culture can be by just looking at a different country. I never really thought about how the wizard community would change based on what part of the world you're looking at. However I wouldn't give this movie a 10/10. I loved almost every aspect of it. And while I completely agree with the casting of this film, I think the actors themselves could use some work. They were all lovely and very good at what they do, however I wasn't totally convinced. Katherine Waterston, for example is a good actress but she always had a worried look on her face throughout the whole movie. Even in moments when her Character, Tina, had no reason to be worried. I felt like Eddie Redmayne (Newt) showed very little emotion through the course of the movie. He wasn't nearly as bad as Kristen Stewart was in the Twilight saga but who can be? Anyway, overall this was a very good movie. I would buy it! I think the acting could use some work but this was still a wonderful film."
" Well, everything's in the title itself, you watch it only to confirm.
",0.2732,0.99,2017-04-14 00:00:00,5,"I don't want to be so negative like the film critics, but this is a big disappointment for me watching being a film fanatic. I don't think anyone who loved 'Harry Potter' film series would thumb this new beginning. This is not like 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' from the same universe, but different trilogies. I was excited for something like that, as a concept wise, for the fresh tale from from the fresh characters in the same universe. I don't know about the book version, but the film did not click for me.It had a bunch of nice characters, and to set in the Harry Potter universe, really it should have been a masterpiece. The major drawback was the story. There's nothing to appreciate the screenplay. It's about some creatures from the magical world got out in the human world, just like 'Jumanji'. So our hero struggles to recapture them. Meanwhile, some others too involved in and the reason will be revealed in the final stage.Nice casting and great visuals. I won't point out its director's fault, because he has done his duty very well. He's also will be the man behind the rest of the sequels. I think it deserved the Oscars for the costume design. Not a bad film, particularly for the kids. Comparing it with the Harry Potter franchise makes it a worst film, but independently it is an okay film. So the initiation was average, but I'm still expecting the follow ups to be much better.5/10"
" A darker spin on the Harry Potter universe, in a visual feast and engaging cinema!
",0.4003,0.9962,2017-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a beautiful film. It looks like a cross between an Edward Hopper painting and Raoul Walsh's gangster pictures of the 1940s but with a heavy dose of magic in the foreground to boot. To watch David Yates' film makes for a wonderful juxtaposition of styles akin to the finest steam-punk.Set in 1920s New York, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them follows Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne, fresh from his Oscar win for The Theory of Everything) as he attempts to hunt down some mysterious monsters who threaten to unravel the secret magic community and user in tragedy.As this is from the pen of Harry Potter novelist JK Rowling, you can expect an ensemble cast of friendly and shady characters interacting in their own world of intricate details that is as threatening as it is tempting. It's Garden of Eden stuff on a Hollywood scale - something that David Yates mastered in the final Harry Potter films he helm- ed.In fact, it's a surprisingly dark affair with social satire undertones that border on Terry Gilliam territory (who would make an excellent choice of director for future films in the inevitable franchise).The less you know about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them going in, the better so I won't spoil the surprises for the sake of this review but I will say that if you enjoy well crafted fantasy with gorgeous production values and a twee tone, you can't go far wrong with this. But of course try to have patience because these types of films need a little more concentrated viewing then most other."

Better just get a beer and sleep. There are not too many worse methods to invest your time. Why do they make movies like this?

" A World Full of Magic
",0.0,0.7227,2017-04-05 00:00:00,5,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" delves into the wizarding world of J.K Rowling. The movie takes place in 1926 New York. Though being a good movie overall, showing a great display of CGI effects, it lacked character development and is scattered with several under- developed plots that tie together at the end, leaving you confused as to what was happening. Most of the movie is spent with four characters searching around New York for creatures that escaped from a magical briefcase in which they were held in. There is also a guy who is searching around for a kid with magical powers, but never really tells you why he needs this kid. The movie ties the plots together, ending with heroes versus villains fight. Yet a confusing plot throughout the movie, I still enjoyed and hope to see more to come of J.K Rowling's stories."
" Long-winded title, excellent movie.
",0.5719,0.9609,2017-04-05 00:00:00,10,"Personally I found this movie to be 2+ hours of excellent entertainment. This is one of these movies where I simply cannot understand how people can give one and two star ratings stating that it is garbage etc. I do not get what these people expected? Maybe they just have to complain? The original Harry Potter books are very much books for children or young adults and so is this movie. It is a highly entertaining story in a magical universe with some adventure, some suspense and a lot of humor.The magic and the magical animals are quite cool. The pocket universe (or whatever they are called in the Harry Potter world) is simply gorgeous and cool. The story is not really much to write home about but it does not have to be. This is a magical movie where the magical atmosphere is what makes the movie. It is a good enough story involving a bit of suspense, action, friendship, bad guys, quite some humor and, of course, a lot of magic. More importantly perhaps, the story is not overly stupid nor does is try to peddle crappy SJW nonsense messages about gender or diversity nor climate. This movie delivers where it counts as far as I am concerned. It is entertaining, plain and simple.If I should endeavor try to find something to complain about it would probably be that the lead character was fairly bland. He did not really have much charisma. That and the fact that I never really understood which, despicable (presumably) acts the main opponent, Grindelwald, had actually committed before the events of the movie.On the whole I enjoyed the movie a lot and although it is perhaps not the absolutely best movie I have ever seen but it still deserves a top rating."
" An Entertaining TransAtlantic Excursion
",0.4404,0.9973,2017-04-04 00:00:00,9,"I deliberately avoided this one for a while because I initially thought, ""oh no, not some diluted hogwarts cash-grab"" but you know what? I really enjoyed this film. Set in roaring 20s NewYorkCity, we get to explore the differences in how wizard affairs are handled on the other side of the pond, how bureacracy and bias affect relationships between the magic world and the ""no-majs"" (yankee for muggles) and how this leads to misunderstandings and internal strife.(This is much more exciting than I just made it sound) The pacing, visual effects and characters are all excellent. Great performances from a great cast. Eddie Redmayne is suitably quirky as a secret agent/zookeeper with a soft spot for muggles and creatures of all kinds. Also delightful in the role of Queenie is Fine Frenzy who bears an uncanny resemblance to Rachel Weisz (I am in love with both actresses) She is one to watch out for. Colin Farrell turns in his best performance since In Bruges. I really cannot overstate how much I liked this cast and cared what happened to them (even the cgi beasts, that range from adorable to terrifying) There are some minor plot points that could have been better handled, but they really did not take away from my enjoyment of this film. I would definitely recommend this on 4k bluray, streaming or wherever you may find it."
" I enjoyed it immensely!
",0.5562,0.995,2017-04-03 00:00:00,10,"I freely admit to still be going through ""Potter withdrawal"", but if you are a fan of the entire Potterverse, there are sly little ""Easter Eggs"" throughout this film, that are just delightful. Eddie Redmayne was a solid choice, and his ""Harry"" to Dan Fogler's ""Ron"" was inspired. Since discovering this world within the books in 2002 (late to the party, I know), I've come to a better appreciation of what recreating this world on the big screen entails. Sure, the purists will gripe about the amount of CGI manipulation, but in point of fact, building sound stages and shooting on location is expensive, drives up the budget and by extension, the ticket prices, so I'm okay with CGI. But this movie gives a view into ""wizarding"" communities outside Great Britain that didn't get enough attention in the books or the movies. Ms. Waterston and Ms. Sudol were wonderfully right for their rolls as big sister/little sister, and to that, I only have one gripe: Tina should have kissed Newt. And Grindelwald: Well, let's just say, the payoff is good!"
" Loved It, But...
",0.5994,0.958,2017-04-03 00:00:00,7,"As someone who has loved the Harry Potter books and movies, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, which is visually stunning and delightfully continues the Potterverse. However, viewers who have not read the books -- seeing the HP movies is not enough -- might find themselves a bit lost. Beyond that slight obstacle, I would have liked to have seen the Second Salemers drawn more sharply and sinister from the start, Eddie Redmayne (who I love and was perfectly cast as Newt Scamander) not swallow his dialogue, Graves/Grindelwald and Picquery recast with more energetic and dynamic actors and at the end Picquery, to show her gratitude to Newt and just a glimmer that she ""gets it"" to have made some gesture to somehow assist in Frank's safe journey to Arizona alone (I don't believe Frank can make himself invisible but if he can that was not made clear). The way things ended between the MACUSA President and Newt fell a bit flat. I think these changes would have made FB even more enjoyable."
" Great Movie. Ignore the bad reviews.
",-0.2263,0.9647,2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"lets be honest here. Whenever a movie franchise is successful. You get a certain kind of level of standards and expectation and along with that comes the annoying and all to distasteful need to hold a certain work of art/literature/motion picture to your level of standards and expectations. in my humble opinion this movie was great. It has all the magical qualities of a previous Harry potter films (the earlier less darker films with a new twist , plot characters to keep on delivering good films. anyone that disagrees with this doesn't need to be writing reviews.Thanks for taking the time to read this, you be the judge if you enjoyed the film, either way JK Rowling wont loose sleep over it.4 out 5 stars."
" A more positive review
",0.5984,0.9937,2017-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Alright due to the number of negative reviews here I decided it needed some more positive ones as well. As most people my age I grew up with Harry Potter, I loved the books and enjoyed the movie and spent a lot of time in between each book reading fan fictions and dreaming about the Harry Potter world. Still I can honestly say I feel The Fantastic Beasts is the best of all the Harry Potter movies (if you categorise it as a Harry Potter movie). This is mostly due to the completeness of the story as a movie in comparison to the Harry Potter movies that only felt complete in its book form and often lacked essential details for the story to make sense as a movie. This might be obvious as this was written as a movie from the start, but I still find it an important point.In this movie we are introduced to the wizard world in America which is shown to have a lot of issues. I really enjoy how J K Rowling has used the history of the time and brought real societies into the movie, giving it a sense of realism and grounding it to our world. Of course not everyone might realise this (myself included, I was never good in history). As the story develops however, it seems a bit like two parallel story lines happening at ones and one not completely finishing. This I find is quite reasonable as this is the first movie of a series after all and you need some side action (+ I love the fun creatures).The main character Newt Scamander kind seem a bit weird at times and a bit hard to understand, nevertheless I found him quite relatable due to this. As someone that often comes across as a bit shy and introverted there is very few relatable characters on the screen, but I do understand how it might be seen as a bit unusual to have this kind of lead when we are not used to it.In the end I really love how well the story references to the Harry Potter books. There was not a single point which made me doubt the story and everything just fits, even solving some unsolved mysterious."
" A dash of STAR WARS flavored with a dash of Harry Potter
",-0.6523,-0.4416,2017-03-29 00:00:00,7,"This film of a JD Rowling novels spins some elements of her HARRY POTTER series and some of the well known STAR WARS movie series. Set in New York City between the world wars some quite fascinating travelogues of Manhattan of the era are one of the better aspects of the movie as well as some of the photographic sequences the trademark of STAR WARS and HARRY POTTER. With these fine points in mind the general storyboard and the general editing technique produces a product well below the stratospheric, top of the market standards still associated with STAR WARS and HARRY POTTER. The problem is it has none of the unexpectedly delightful storyline twists and supernatural premise elements which made the previous two series so memorable."
" Terrible Movie
",-0.4767,0.7686,2017-03-28 00:00:00,4,"To start, I have never seen a Harry Potter movie so my opinion is unbiased. This movie isn't worth seeing. It had so many plot holes that it wasn't funny and it dragged on so much longer than it should have. This movie was 2 hours and 13 minutes but you could have cut off at least half an hour if you took out all the useless conversations and the exposition. This movie, although it was dry and boring, the music and sound was very good and it was very good with the camera work. This movie also has a perfect love story waiting to happen, which I was routing for but they completely denied the possibility of it."

The movie is very well down.There are slight hints to harry potter world with mentions of Hogwarts, the ministry of magic, The textbook that harry potter uses in Hogwarts ""Fantastic Beast where to find them""The movie does stay true to roots. Gellert Grindelwald is portrayed by Johnny Depp and during the film we can see that the character has a gay Ora around him in the way he touches and speaks with Grivence and his hair style. When Gellert even mentions Dumbledore there seems to be a sign of affection.The movie is a standalone and leaves you satisfied.

" This movie had potential, they just couldn't find it
",0.0,-0.859,2017-03-25 00:00:00,4,"I didn't have great expectations about this movie. Even though, I was completely disappointed. There's a lot of things that I find wrong about this movie, so get ready for it.First of all, it lasts a little bit more than 2 hours. It felt like 4. I like long movies, this wasn't entertaining or interesting enough.The main characters, boring, unlikeable and at times even annoy. How is that an expert in fantastic creatures keep losing them? I was hoping to see a strong female character, that didn't happen either. Madam President seemed very promising but she doesn't really do anything. Secondary characters Jacob and Queenie were actually my favorites. I would gladly watch a movie about them.The creatures were okay. You get to meet a lot of different ones but you don't get to fall in love with any of them because the movie is not actually about the creatures but about some crazy evil power terrorizing New York. Everyone remember the hippogryph in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. That could have happened here, but, although the movie is quite long, apparently there wasn't time for that. I really like the invisible one, I would've loved to see more of it.BIG SPOILERS AHEAD: The other big problem that I have with the movie is how ridiculous certain actions were like there's a scene in which Newt uses the spell accio to capture one of the creatures. Really? Couldn't you think about that before? In another scene, Jacob kicks a door that was protected by magic and manages to open it. Wow, who came up with that? It's just stupid. The invisible creature becomes visible from one moment to the next. The characters often seem to forget they are wizards and don't use magic to their advantage. They erase citizens memories by using magic rain, but somehow people inside their houses, not being touch by the water, seem to be under the spell as well. Nothing makes sense sometimes.This movie had potential, but they couldn't find it. Honestly, the plot was like two completely different movies put together. One aiming to be a funny adventure (it doesn't really achieve that too much, but you can tell they try) And a creepy, dark, strange movie about evil and destruction. The whole city is torn apart and no one seems to care and the villains kind of suck. If they wanted to make a movie about Grindewald they should have done that. He's one of my favorite characters from the Harry Potter's books and he is not even actively in them. Make a movie about Dumbledore's youth. That would be amazing. Don't praise movies just because they're part of the franchise. It's not worth it."

Eddie Redmayne kept telling people that his beasts were not dangerous. Imagine a five tons rhino-like monster chasing you and just it wanted to mate with you. Was it dangerous? A monster broken into you Jewellery store, stole 10 millions worth of diamonds from you, and broke everything in your shop. Was it dangerous? Either Eddie Redmayne was lying or the story was poorly written. Talking about Eddie Redmayne, 90% of time, he showed his left face to the camera. And he always looked at wrong places or wrong angles. Why? Why? Why? It made me headache when I saw him act. Did he really think his left face looked better? Where was the movie director? I hope he can answer my question. Too much CGI. Even if the producer can afford it, his production team just don't understand how to use it. The result was fake looking stuffy scene after scene. I was induced to watch this movie by a poster, because I saw Johnny Depp on it. Turns out Depp only play an unnecessary role for about 10 seconds in the last part of the movie. I felt cheated. Hey Johnny, shame on you. You should not have participated in this kind of grade B production. I still feel cheated.The story is weak. Production was weak. Acting was poor. This movie is overrated."

Now, I need to write down my opinion in my first review here. Yeah, it's that bad.The story doesn't exist. There are a few subplots, but no main story. We have animals, magical politics, mages versus humanity, a baker, an investigation. If you choose one of it, you have a great idea for a film! But no, they didn't decide, they wanted all of it for this two hours! That's the main reason why the movie is awful. You have magical animals in the city... nice base for an adventure! The head of the American wizards is an evil sorcerer who wants to use black magic to conquer, even if he had to kill little children... what a great idea for a dark, gritty story! The world is divided, we have magic and the other, grey world... and the war is coming. The fat worker wants to start a new bakery with the lil' help by the wizards.... let's make a comedy! ... No, they wanted to make everything in this two hours!After the end credits, we are at the starting point again. We cannot let the humanity observe the magical world... so after we have destroyed New York, we have to rebuild it in like two minutes and then wipe out the memories of the whole city! (I hope they thought about that couple thousand dead people in the houses.) We have lost the animals... but we can cache all of them at half-time of the screening time without problems! There is a man who knows everything about us now... but we can delete the memories with a rain, so doesn't matter! ... If you see the first five minutes, it's enough. Nothing will change!The film is lying to you. Before your execution, you can see your merry memories with your mother... oups, a memory where you are hitting a bad step-mother. Why? Because subplots! If they will know the magic is real, there will be war... nope, we can wipe the memories, never mind. But if you flies with a car in plain sight or use magic at home, you're dead to the magic world! Memory wipe? Hmmm... never heard of it. You need the proper wand to use magic... but if you are evil, you can use the Force. You cannot use spell in the streets... let's teleport all the time! We don't need to think about the plot if you can be anywhere in a sec!It's not about the animals, it's not about America, it's not about anything, only about money and franchise building. And with franchise building, they are actively destroying the old Harry Potter series.A movie without consequences is boring."

K Rowling created and scripted the famous saga of the ""Harry Potter"" and David Yates realized these But with this new movie we are entering a new universe and a new saga of its own.This film is fantastic as its name suggests and everything is wonderful there the animations and the special effects are fantastic and completely bluffing, Eddie Redmayne as Norbert Dragonneau, Katherine Waterston as Tina, Dan Fogler in the role of Jacob Kowalski, Alison Sudol in the role of Queenie Goldstein, and finally Not less brilliant Colin Farrell in the role of Percival Graves, to name but a few. We must not forget the whole technical team who did an extraordinary job, there is no secrets, to make a great film, it takes all the ingredients that I have just listed and you will see a film with great Spectacle for all public, the one that marks the cinema. Despite all these positive points, we will always be unhappy, but we will only have to see those who have the eyes of children and who still want to dream the space of a very great moment of cinema that will take place before their eyes astounded and Who will be delighted to have seen such a pretty thread. The ensemble will also be served by the soundtrack of the excellent James Newton Howard who ensures as always and gives each time a plus to the films of which he composes the original music. At the beginning of the credits a furtive apparition of Johnny Deep in view of the opus two of which everyone looks forward like me. My conclusion this film is stunning and will delight millions of people for many years."
" About magic, without magic
",0.0,0.9871,2017-03-14 00:00:00,3,"First of all it is sad to see that so many people rated this movie 10/10. Why? Have you not seen anything any better in your life? It is really hard to believe and I hope this is not the case. Or are you just a paid service for the film industry? Second, let's assume that this movie was intended for kids. Targeted age group like 8-14, maybe? Fair guess? It is a Harry Potter movie after all. Now why would you spend 100+ million on a story that has no moral at all? Kids, what have we learned? That flying blue serpents can change their size and teleportation is used only when it is not needed (vs. when you are locked in a cell)? Do we know what was the whole movie about? No? It was definitely not about saving the innocents or helping those in need. Poor guy who had been beaten regularly by his step-mother and also been betrayed by the only man who had seemed to ever care about him got shot dead for no direct reason by a bunch of lead magicians. Could they have tried to free him from the obscurus? Sure, at least they could have tried. Yeah but did they? No. Did they feel bad about just killing the boy? Maybe in the bottom of their hearts, but without any visible signs it is hard to tell. Third. The only character you could like was the bakery guy. I rooted for him a lot to get the most out of his situation and elope with the pretty blonde girl who seemed to be caring for him :) How did it end? They said goodbye because that is the 'rule' in the world of magic and he was given money (silver eggshells) instead. Point made very clear - let go love, take money instead. Kids, I hope you were listening.All in all this movie was spectacular, gripping, I liked most actors in their role, and it was full of sh_t, thanks to the storyline. If you create a magical word that could be a getaway from real life which has its real life problems and real life cruelty, why not make it a nice one where people care about each other and love is more important than wealth? Especially when the story is meant to be told to children."
" Just... awful

Extremely bad director, bad scenario, bad characters, bad soundtrack too.But that's not all, the worst thing in this movie is the story. Several days ago I gave it another go and just realized that even I, a complete amateur writer, would've been deeply ashamed if I would write such a story. It's that bad. Everything evolving about some ""magic"" animals, who look gross, don't do anything cool, it's basically a movie with pokemons.Obviously there will be fans, as it happens with everything bad. But this move gave me such sour taste after (well, couldn't actually finish it because at some moment after half I catched myself looking at my wife who was also looking at me, and we both started to laugh and said ""dafuq is this ?"" Then we just closed it and started to look at a Supernatural episode who was 10x better than whole Fantastic beasts. And it wasn't even a good episode compared to others :)TLDR: If you like Fantastic Beasts, my son, you have a severe issue."

" It feels good to be back in Rowling's world again
",0.4404,0.9988,2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Despite the enormous financial success of the eight-part Harry Potter series, adapted from J.K. Rowling's equally successful books, they never seemed to reach the heights of greatness that their box- office receipts would suggest. The main problem the few directors chosen to adapt the novels faced was having to condense the increasingly bulky word count into a coherent 2 hour plus movie. They were never anything less than fun and enchanting, but the films suffered from cramming in too many plot-lines and character backgrounds, and often felt like they were frantically lunging from one scene to the next. With Potter's time at Hogwarts now over, many wondered where Rowling would go next, and if she would even return to world of wizards, witches and house-elves at all.To the fan's delight, she chose to keep her first screenplay within the same universe as Hagrid and Voldemort, but instead focus on a character frequently mentioned in the books as an author and good friend to headmaster Dumbledore. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was the name of the textbook Harry, Hermione and Ron would often brood over, and Newt Scamander the man behind it. The development of this revered encyclopaedia of the many weird and wonderful creatures unknown to mere muggles is the focus of Rowling's first movie attempt, and the action jumps back in time to 1920s New York to find the young Newt - played with a delightful hunched eccentricity by Eddie Redmayne - discovering a world completely different the one in his native Britain.He is in the U.S. to raise awareness of the need to protect the beloved creatures of the world, and comes with a magical bag stuffed with the oddities. But much like the dangerous world Harry Potter grew up in 70-odd years later, the wizarding community live in fear of an evil wizard named Gellert Grindelwald (I won't spoil who plays him), who has recently murdered several aurors all over Europe. However, Newt has more pressing issues when some of his fantastic beasts escape, and his suitcase accidentally ends up in the hands of bumbling wannabe-baker and muggle ('no-maj' in American) Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). Teaming up with recently-demoted auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), Newt must round up the creatures wreaking havoc while convincing the Magical Congress that his pets aren't to blame for several unexplained deaths happening across the city.There's certainly a lot going on in this movie, and early on it feels like Rowling is asking a hell of a lot of the audience in taking in this new ensemble of new characters and a whole new kind of wizarding world (wizard-muggle relationships are strictly banned here). Yet the story quickly falls into place, and Rowling delights in creating a wonderful array of genuinely fantastic beasts, each with their own unique look, quirks and special abilities. With a hushed voice and gently inquisitive personality, Newt instantly brings to mind Sir David Attenborough, one of the greatest human beings on this planet. His briefcase is like a tardis, containing an entire zoo of exotic creatures, each with their own habitat to suit their needs. When Newt takes the awestruck Jacob for a grand tour, it's almost like watching an episode of Planet Earth, and this use of commentary on the state of species' endangerment in the real world adds a bit of depth to the story.Although Alfonso Cuaron certainly made the best entry into the Potter film franchise, David Yates has been the steady hand to guide the series since number 5, so it's of no surprise that he was chosen to take the reins again. Like before, he brings a flair to the magical moments, and the special effects constantly impress (while they may not be up to the recent Jungle Book's standards). Yet the best scenes are during the quieter moments, and in particular a scene at dinner involving a dazed Jacob and Tina's sexy sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), and their charming flirtations. Newt's friendship with Jacob forms the emotional backbone of the story, and Fogler damn near steals the entire film. There's also fine support from Colin Farrell as a shady Congress official, and Samantha Morton and Ezra Miller as a fanatical mother and son rallying no-majs against wizards. While the climax may descend slightly into fight- the-CGI-fart-cloud nonsense, it just feels good to be back in Rowling's world again."
" Extended Potterverse gets its feet wet with imaginative, fun story
",0.5106,0.995,2017-03-07 00:00:00,7,"At long last, a return to the world of ""Harry Potter"" — and a test to see what kind of legs ""Potter""-themed but Potter-less stories might have on the big screen. Directed by franchise mainstay David Yates with a script by no less than J.K. Rowling herself, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" has all the right minds and talents to guide the brand into the future and capture more than just the ""Potter""-obsessed audience.When it comes down to it, not being a ""Harry Potter"" story is the toughest piece of ""Fantastic Beasts"" to swallow. There's no substituting for Harry, Ron, Hermione and co. Yet thanks to Rowling's direct involvement, however, we feel warmly invited into another corner of the Potterverse, one that exudes the same exceptional world-building that has charmed millions of readers and viewers over the last nearly 20 years.""Fantastic Beasts"" follows magical creatures collector and activist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a British wizard who arrives in New York City in 1926 on a secretive mission who becomes unwittingly entangled in American wizarding business after a creature escapes his briefcase. In his effort to wrangle it, he performs magic in front of a no-maj (the American term for ""muggle"") named Kowalski (Dan Fogler). He's caught by Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a witch working for the Magical Congress (MACUSA) and turned in to MACUSA authorities who — led by auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) — have been investigating devastating attacks by a invisible magical force, and are dealing with immense political pressure from a senator, not to mention a witch hunt led by Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) and her adopted children.It's all a bit messy, but with every new character and creature, Rowling builds out more of her world, fleshing it out with details true to the spirit of ""Harry Potter."" It's something only she could write — at least for this first foray into uncharted ""Potter"" territory. The many characters and story components would've probably worked better with more time to develop (i.e. as a book), but we're still easily pulled into her story.The casting is outstanding and the quality of the performances nearly overcomes the lack of emotional investment we feel in the characters as a result of the plot complexities. Redmayne, for example, defies the typical portrait of a protagonist. He's guarded, socially awkward, yet unabashed, which makes sense given his profession, but Redmayne gives it such nuance. We are left wanting to know more about him, and all the characters: Waterston is a refreshing change of a pace for a leading lady and even Fogler defies his typecasting in a lovely way. Curiosity toward the characters isn't a substitute for investment, but it's a consolation prize few blockbusters with similar troubles are even capable of handing out.The tone of ""Fantastic Beasts"" is a little more whimsical than the grimness of the last few ""Potter"" films, even though all the main characters are adults and many facets of the plot (and concepts) cater toward a more mature audience. The whimsy comes in the many creatures and all the hijinks involved with finding and catching the ones that get loose. Unfortunately, the final action sequence feels more like a scene from ""Transformers,"" but the smaller ones are clever and inspired, usually involving some quirk that educates us about a particular creature.If ""Fantastic Beasts"" is just about building new structures and establishing new parameters for more films set in Rowling's world, then it does its job. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" the first book, was one of the weaker books and films of the series as a whole, but undoubtedly it generated a curiosity to see more of where the characters and story might go, and it went to rather amazing places. If the same holds true of this would-be franchise, we're all in good shape.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Review for more"

Fans of the ""Harry Potter"" films will love all of the little references thrown into the film. As for the villain of the film, I was pleasantly surprised at how interesting they were and the ultimate climax was quite satisfying. Jacob is defiantly the character to keep an eye on, I feel he is the strongest in the film. Overall, it was an unexpected and enjoyable journey, I can not wait to see what follows."

Just bombarding with visual effects is not going to bring in audience. The story is simply there to show all the creatures that they want to show. The whole film looks out of sync and just visual effects no longer works!!!"

Don't want to spoil but they used one character as an exposition device all the way through and then sacked off at the end like it was nothing. Meh acting, less than exciting story. Bloody awful lot. Just cashing in on the Harry Potter name .just really boring.For a while it is exactly what movies are supposed to be ... entertaining! I liked the unusual animals but the magic imagery is a poor copy of the HP imagery. After a while the beasts and animals are just more HP type animals. Unlike HP story lines which always had stories within stories within stories this is shallow by comparison."
" A Great Start for the Harry Potter Spin Off Franchise

Each character is likable and interesting, sadly except for the villain character, who's only purpose is to set up the sequel. What's even more impressive is that the film didn't need to unnecessarily set up the first Harry Potter film even though it's a prequel, unlike past prequels where they have unnecessary scenes just to set up the original film. Overall, Fantastic Beasts is a great start to a new fantasy prequel franchise."
" Completely off the Magic!
",0.0,-0.9321,2017-03-04 00:00:00,2,"I am completely disappointed with this movie. It lacks in story, characters and ""magic"". There is nothing to be considered magic in an American pre-war atmosphere. And I would never have thought that the US accent would harm so much to this movie, almost as it would be a parody (a cheap one) of a famous movie. Don't get me wrong I love US accent but here it is completely out of place. The characters are weak and also the beasts are mere mix-ups of real animals or horrid mutations, (I have never seen a hypo-rhino with a brain tumour that big or a Puffer-tiger).Honestly you coulnd't come up with beter ideas? Poor creature concepts. It feels like Jk Rowling had a second thought about ""no more Harry Potter movies"" and rushed a quick book to make up for lost time."

" Not enjoyable at all
",-0.3412,-0.9706,2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,"This is a total cash grab. If it's wasn't for the Harry Potter-related pedigree, if this was just some fantasy Disney or Dreamworks movie, nobody would pay it any more attention than countless other FX films.It's just not good. It's boring. The characters are bland and pointless. The story is nonsensical gibberish. Period. You don't have a good movie with that right there.But it's also produced poorly. NYC looks sterile and fake. It never seems like they aimed a camera at a real street or a carefully built set. It's that shined up virtual set that George Lucas brought us in the Star Wars prequels. Bleh.The titular beasties are absolutely uninspiried. Napoleon Dynamite's ""liger"" is about the extent of what you get. A platypus that steals jewelry. A rhino with an inflatable snout. Every animal is 2-3 actual animals mashed up.These ""magical world"" movies are making the movie-going public weary. How many of these can the put out and make money? Weird magic people who live in complex fantasy worlds with lots of rules. BFG and Mrs. Perigrine's Home for Unusual Children come to mind.Harry Potter succeeded because it was the story of a family and the central characters were children discovering a whimsical new world. And the princial photography was shot on location in actual historic buildings. The CGI supported the story. In this movie, the CGI is the central character. Why would anyone care about a bunch of fake animals and a mumbling main character we know nothing about? And that's why this prequel doesn't work... it thinks that it can make 5 movies about 1920s NYC, the magic world and beasts. It fails to realize that HP succeeded because it was a family story about a boy who happened to live within a wizard world and had a whole epic plot centered on his family. The wizard world was the backdrop. Even the name ""Fantastic Beasts"" is a tip off that the screenwriters are clueless. Plots need protagonists and villains. We need a family, a motivation, emotion. Not bland characters chasing fake looking beasts. Ugh. Awful. Skip it!"
" Fantastic Movies and Where to Find Them
",0.5574,0.6904,2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"J.K. Rowling does even better this time. This film is less childish than the first two Harry Potter movies in some ways. Redmayne and the entire cast were excellent. The 1920s atmosphere was swell. I have not read the book as I thought it was going to be another book that is leaching on the success of the Harry Potter franchise. The only book of hers outside the HP series that I read was The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which was alright but was not HP or anywhere close. Now I am reconsidering my decision of not reading this book."

Colleen Atwood's and Stuart Craig's work was awesome. Otherwise, this was total crap. It was overblown dreck; so full of itself that it forgot to tell a watchable story. Eddie Redmayne was out of place, as were Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton and Jon Voight. Voight has become nothing more than a washed-up, irrelevant actor, willing to do anything for a paycheck. Morton and Farrell are so much better than this. The visual effects were nothing new or spectacular and the ""cute, little beasts"" were ugly and irritating. James Newton Howard's score was just average. So, other than the sets and wardrobe, this movie sucked. Two stars for Atwood, two stars for Craig, zero for the rest of this silliness."

He realizes a wonderful movie with a lot of magic and a beautiful story! I explain me: First, the soundtracks. Throughout the movie, your mind is carried away with the sound. You can't resist. It's always with magic, that make you feel so good and in the story with the characters. That make you feel all of emotions! You cry, you're laughing and smile with characters. I always love the music from movies but in this one, this special. In second time, characters are good, the game of players is just and not over played. The main character is Eddy Redmayne. It's a very good actor. He has already played in ""The Danish Girl"", ""The Miserable"" and a lot of big production. This movie is the first for him who he played for children. He receives some rewards for this movie and for ""The Danish Girl"". The director chooses him for this and we understand why. He brings something mysterious. In last time, the story has something special. Is not easy to follow ""Harry Potter"". The director has made that with genius. Every event is chosen for different raisons. First, it's always surprising! And that explain one thing every time. To finish this review on Fantastic Beats, I have one thing to say: I love it. The director has managed the challenge."

Why is this wizard so incompetent that so many creatures managed to escape?Also, perhaps in the tradition of Harry Potter, this Newt character is played by an actor with the same blank expression throughout the entire movie. This guy isn't particularly cute. Is there a reason this actor was chosen, or have they run out of good actors with British accent?The special effects was pretty good, except in one scene where Newt was petting a creature, it looked as if the creature was added on later.The story was so-so. I don't particularly like the main character Newt. The fact that there was very little character development may add to this feeling.The female co-star isn't particularly attractive, but at least she has more facial expressions.For some reason, there is no feeling of watching a magical movie. It feel as if I'm just watching a bunch of CGI clips.I'd rather re-watch an early episode of Harry Potter than this movie."

" I liked it (Detailed Review)
",0.4215,0.9989,2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"When I heard of the announcement of FBAWTFT movie, I was extremely excited and overwhelmed, because I really miss Harry Potter and like any dedicated potterhead I have a continuous thirst and craving for the wizarding world. However, my expectations for the movie have dropped to rock bottom after reading The Cursed Child. I was afraid and worried that the movie might actually ruin my favorite series of all-time.And since it's an original screenplay, I can say that it's a quite frightening experience when you go to watch a movie that is based on your favorite book/film series while being completely clueless about the plot and the characters.Yesterday, I finally got the chance to watch it, and I got very emotional from the very first second when the Hedwig's theme started playing. And after watching the movie, I'm glad to announce that my worries were put to rest. I might be biased but I liked it, despite its many flaws. It gave me a nice feeling and made me recall beautiful memories. It was funny, entertaining, visually and aurally stunning and I enjoyed every Harry Potter reference. I think Harry potter is still way better, but this one is good too. It's kind of like a grown up version of Harry Potter for us the grown up potterheads. (Spoilers ahead, don't read if you haven't watched the movie)The movie has two major story-lines, Newt Scamander and his beasts and the second story-line was about the weird events in New York and the 'Obscurus'. I was intrigued by the latter very much. It made me think for a while and wonder if Ariana Dumbledore is an Obscurus too. I hear there was a deleted scene about Credence survival. Please make him survive, I liked this kid a lot. I don't think we knew everything about him. They didn't tell us about his parents or how did Mary Lou find him and why does she hate his mother so much. I want more of him. Colin Farrell did a great job as Graves, I think he stole the show. I really wish if they would keep him as Grindelwald instead of Depp. I liked him more. And BTW, what did Grindelwald mean when he looked at Newt and said ""Will we die, Just a little?"" Was that an implication that they both were seeking the deathly hallows? I hope so. I'm madly interested in Grindelwald and I only hope that Johnny Depp will do justice to his character.Eddie Redmayne was good as Newt. I think he acted the awkwardness and shyness of Newt well. But his character was one-dimensional with no development. I really wished that they let us know more about his past Instead of some of the heavily CGI creatures' unnecessary scenes. Harry Potter had better CGI-ed creatures without claiming to have fantastic beasts in its title. And that Leda Lestrange mention! Is she related to Bellatrix? And what did she do to Newt? The movie brought up a lot of questions that hopefully we will get answers of in the upcoming movies.The main characters were okay. Not bad and not good either. I think the flat characters is one of its biggest flaws, unlike Harry Potter complex great characters. The No-Mag was funny and he asked the right questions to enlighten the confused muggle viewers. The sisters are fun. I dislike Queenie a bit because of her brutal joke about Hogwarts.And I really liked Rowling's political statement on suppression and fear of other and her criticism of the segregation and racism between muggles and wizards (expressed from both sides) in the American magical society.I'll have to warn you that the movie gets cheesy and predictable at some points, but overall it was entertaining. You won't regret it, especially if you're a potterhead.The movie is like an appetizer and it lays a foundation for the upcoming 4-movies. Hopefully they will be better. I still have faith in Rowling's imagination and I really can't wait for them. Especially after the hint from Rowling that the famous Dumbledore and Grindelwald duel might be on the final film. And I hope that some of the old characters will get back. I'd love to see a young Snape, Lily, Siruis or Lupin."
" A brand new, different story
",0.0,-0.7123,2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"I've just watched the movie, and I began to notice how it was really different from Harry Potter arch-story. Harry Potter arch-story, as I realize, focused more or less 90% on Harry himself. From the books and the movies, it's Harry's teen life, his social adaptation to the magical world, and his personal thoughts and principles (and romance), along with his struggles with his problems and against his enemies, lurking behind his back. It may be comparable to some movies about teens' lives. This one is American magical world, in adults' point of view. We get to see the American government of the magical world, and how they work. I can say it's a bit fascist (correct me if I'm wrong), since you can give people a death penalty for exposing the magical world, without further investigation. There's no hearing like in Harry's case, nor a prison (I'm not sure, is Azkaban only within Britain's jurisdiction?). It's just a plain decision. Graves speaks, and the witches do. And it's pretty scary. The plot and the characters may not be strong aspects in this movie, but of years of Hogwarts, I'm genuinely delighted seeing the world of wizards and witches, further, broader, and deeper."

And they would have been confronting each other happily ever after, but then came a sociophobic British pokemon catcher moonlighting as a WWF volunteer, and it all went haywire...Just as a disclaimer, I'm a total muggle, devoid of any worship for the Harry Potter universe. So all these people who are so powerful, but only as long as they have a phallic symbol in their hands to play with, have absolutely zero effect on me, well, maybe besides cracking me up. Yet I was hoping that maybe the ties of Fantastic Beasts to HP would be loose enough for me to enjoy the story it tells. And while the connection was pretty thin indeed, at least allowing me to understand what's going on without the previous experience of watching the Harry Potter movies or reading the books, the essence of this film was still too weak to my muggle taste.Yes, we're given some sort of conflict. The magically endowed people are in hiding, something like what the mutants were doing in X-Men: First Class. And, just like in First Class, the mere mortals don't really enjoy the perspective of having such potent and unpredictable neighbors. Those who want to retain the status quo are obviously the good guys, but there's this mysterious baddie who rebels against the set order of things and wants the magical world to be reckoned with at last (wonder if he wears a metal helmet too). To make things worse, some chaotic forces wreak havoc on the peaceful city, threatening an already shaky balance.So what's gonna be the last straw that breaks the camel's back? What will be the center of this convoluted story? Maybe a tormented and cast-out creepy young dude played by Ezra Miller, who's been brilliant at portraying such twisted and complex characters since The Perks of Being a Wallflower and We Need to Talk About Kevin? Maybe an unlikely bond between the depressed foster kid and our loner monster lover? Maybe a fragile feeling between a sensitive ginger Brit and a hyperactive American brunette? Nah, forget this petty nonsense. We'll put in the very center of the story a kleptomaniac platypus and a huge whale/hippo in heat. And don't forget a big shiny griffon, because this is what the audience wants to see!Seriously though, Fantastic Beasts suffers from the same illness the whole Harry Potter franchise seems to have been susceptible to from the very beginning. That is, it brings in so many visually fascinating, but substantially hollow things, but when it comes to the real human drama it's awfully shy to develop things or let them at least be fully revealed. The mysterious villain remains a mere rumor until the very end, and even when he's finally exposed you're left to wonder what's so villainous about him at all. The chaotic threat to the very foundations of the world gets disposed of within minutes with no second thought, making you guess what the fuss was about to begin with. And the characters that showed the most promise walk into the sunset without ever unfolding their true potential.In this story full of magic and weird creatures, the only character that stands out is that poor no-maj who just wanted to get a loan in a bank and simply ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. For him, this kaleidoscope of magic flickering and slapstick action is genuinely novel, so the guy is enjoying every second of it. And why shouldn't he? After all, his real life takes action in a canning factory, so a fairy tale dream would make a pleasant distraction. But it's not the dream itself that makes it so precious, its the inherent fleetingness of it which allows you to take only the best into the real world. And while Mr Kowalski had been graced with a gift of oblivion, nobody is gonna erase our own memory. So, when the two hours are over and the credits start rolling, we'll be unfortunate to ask ourselves: true, it's been all cute and easy to digest, but is that really all the film had to offer?"
" At least we got Jacob and Queenie, and Niffler!
",0.0,0.991,2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"The story is honestly anything but interesting. We got the good guys, the bad guys, the collateral, the good guys win and save the day. There is nothing compelling or unpredictable plot-wise.The biggest downfall is perhaps how bland and outright boring the main characters are, except for the Queenie-Jacob romance subplot. They had chemistry and comedy, as a result managed to spice up an otherwise totally generic blockbuster. As for the creatures, Niffler successfully fulfills the same kind of comedy-relief role as Queenie and Jacob.The secondary downfall is TOO MUCH CGI! If Hollywood is good at one thing, it is spending tens of millions on absolutely terrible special effects. The climax battle is so overblown and confusing that I couldn't care less what is going on because the good guys will inevitably win."
" Statist
",0.0,-0.8999,2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"The things I loved about the Harry Potter series, namely, the anti- authoritarian themes have been completely flopped; where suddenly even though there is a giant wall full of ridiculous rules, we must obey them anyway. The congress of magic makes each situation they encounter worse, yet in the end, they are portrayed as friendly do-gooders. The 'congress' even almost wrongfully and intently killed the protagonists and murdered a troubled child (when the situation was under control), and this is just ended with a friendly farewell, with absolutely no resolution."
" Magic is gone, replaced by seven different visual effects companies
",0.0,0.9893,2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"It is always good to try to summarize a movie you've just seen before you judge its quality, and in the case of Fantastic Beasts, the summary simply doesn't make any sense. It mixes things up, bringing up various ""magical and wondrous"" situations that, on further scrutiny, simply don't add up. But the special effects are great.One thing you learn, though, by... err... watching between scenes? is that they have fully prepared for sequels. They have prepared a purely American magical world, with its own quirks and idiosyncrasies, brought in characters that did almost nothing, but are interpreted by great actors like Jon Voight and Johnny Depp, they left some things unsolved and they made the effort to force Eddie Redmayne act very well in this film.However, one question I have to ask: why on Earth would anyone want sequels to this? It was a bland, nonsensical film filled with impossible to empathize characters like an almost autistic hero that loves animals more than people, an ambitious yet mostly incompetent auror that puts everyone in danger for her own sake, a child like floozy that reads minds only when it doesn't matter and a non magical character that does nothing but follow people around. The villain is hiding his intentions for the entire movie only to expose them for all to see in the final scenes for no real reason. The rest is filled with a side story about child abuse and special effects over special effects.OK, I agree, people are hungry for magic. Anything would work, as exemplified by many of the nonsensical plots in Harry Potter that everyone just gobbled up, but at least those were real books, with real story lines. This was just an ""Insert coin"" sign made into a movie. I lost all confidence that Hollywood, J.K.Rowling advising or not, is capable of bringing the sense of magic and beauty that the original books and films had.Bottom line: Probably Redmayne is an awkward person in real life, too, so it wasn't too difficult for him to play the role, but act he did and he did it well. For that alone I rate this average. Other than that, a pretty picture with no substance and a bitter aftertaste of greed."
" Fair on the eyes, not much content
",0.3182,0.8806,2017-02-26 00:00:00,5,"I wonder if I am getting to old for this but the fact is I found this movie only so-so.Eddie Redmayne was as good as he could be, considering what he was given. I could not relate to any of the characters. Dan Fogler provided several humorous moments, although that seemed to be the single reason for him to be dragged along throughout the movie.The special effects were terrific – I especially loved the scenes where we were first introduced to Newt's creatures. Each was very different and that entire scene was very magical. However, it was just pretty stuff being dumped for the sake of dazzling the viewer.There just did not seem to be much story to it, or what is there is underdeveloped and confusing. Newt has these creatures and some have escaped so he needs to find them. Also, there is a bad guy wreaking havoc throughout Europe (no background whatsoever on the guy). And then there's this weird disturbance distributing mayhem throughout New York.The way these facts came together did not feel tremendously well done and there was just too much going on, with no clear thread uniting it. I feel like this movie can only be truly appreciated by people who read the book because I for one was very confused.Unfortunately the movie did not interest me enough to want to watch the sequels and I cannot say I recommend it."

However, I can't and it is not because of expectations or anything, I didn't have any, but it is because they messed it up really badly.The movie starts off showing headlines, newspaper articles showing about a mysterious and bad man who is never again mentioned in the movie. At the end of the movie a random person suddenly goes: POOF! ""Hello! I was actually that villain you read about in the beginning of this movie. Remember? Since it stated he was a bad guy, we can end the movie when I lose."" Weird isn't it? You'd assume J.K. Rowling knew how to structure stories but this is some 3rd grade writing right there.Nevertheless, the movie kicks off by following the character 'Newt' who accidentally unleash magical creatures over the city of New York. This was a rather bad idea of him as Newt should know that if you enter the city of New York in movie... Well... It will be destroyed. Anything that Newt does in this movie doesn't really matter because, despite the title, magical creatures have nothing to do with the movie. The subplot is suddenly what takes over just so they can destroy New York city.The adventure and joy of Harry Potter and magic was good there for a good portion of the movie but got a massive beat down when the creators realized the credits were suddenly approaching. If you would cut out the last 1/3 of the movie, I'd given it 7/10. I would probably thought it was a surprising abrupt ending. Now though... I never want to see that low level of story telling ever again.Side note: Did you know how many times New York have been destroyed in movies? I googled and some guy counted back in 2014 to 66. They movie industry really blowing that place up."

This one, however, is a lengthy yawnfest. I cannot find anything interesting in this. There's no story, no relatable or lovable characters. Even the CG effects are poor. None of the creatures look real.Halfway through, it becomes clear that the movie is about child abuse. Yeah, hell hath no fury like a child abused. He turns into a tornado that rips New York apart. Beware, parents who spank your children's asses.PS: How come Jacob the baker is played by an actor so unattractive? What did that mind reading Witch see in him other than a pig?The movie makes a lot of money, and garners positive reviews. This is a good example that shows that a poor movie can still be a moneymaking machine, and professional movie critics are full of crap."

But having been a fan but not fanatic of the HP series, I found this movie a mostly boring offshoot of the same. Yes, I see the ties to HP, foreshadowing, etc. but the plot, dialogue, characters, even some of the effects fell flat for me. And I do enjoy effects-rich movies, as long as they support and don't overshadow good characters and good story-lines. But this movie had neither. It never hooked me in to wanting to discover. I think JKRowling is an excellent author, and I did enjoy the HP books more than the movies because they're richer, deeper, and I felt more immersed in that world. And though I did not read this book, perhaps it's a better read than film. I find it hard to believe this will be a 5-part movie series, but there is probably enough momentum with JKR and HP fans to keep it going."

" An enchanting film that brings joy and warmth to your heart
",0.7783,0.9979,2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"I remember feeling very sad when the last Harry Potter film hit the theatres. It was the end of something I deeply loved growing up. Now, JK Rowling's wizarding world is given another chance to be showcased on the big screen. Not only that, the magic moves beyond Hogwarts and London, making its way all the way to 1920s New York.Instead of Harry Potter, our new hero is Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a magical creatures enthusiast, who famously wrote 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' - a text book that Harry and his friends would study 70 years later. Donning a fine blue coat and carrying a briefcase filled with magical creatures, Newt arrives in New York with the intention of reaching Arizona to send Thunderbird back to its natural habitat. However, upon the escape of his most adorable, yet incredibly astute Niffler (who also has an insatiable desire for shiny things), Newt meets Jacob (Dan Fogler), a No-Mag (US equivalent of 'Muggle', which essentially means non- magical folk), who accidentally lets some of his creatures loose in the city. As it turns out, there couldn't be a more terrible time for this to happen. New York is currently ravaged by a mysterious, destructive dark force, and Newt's creatures quickly became suspects by the members of the MCUSA (Magical Congress of USA). One of them is Tina (Katherine Waterson), a disgraced Auror, who quickly grew a liking for Newt but felt compelled to do her duty to report Newt to the Congress in order to keep the magical community safe. As expected from JK Rowling, the magical world depicted in this film brimmed with wonder and charm. Fans of Harry Potter would be pleasantly surprised at the re-appearance of the familiar spells such as 'Obliviate' and 'Alohamora'. The audience is also introduced to new magical concepts, including the 'Obscurus', an uncontrollable, sinister force that appears inside children when they try to suppress their magical powers and the 'Legilimens' – mind- reading art. We see for the first time, the extravagant, majestic interiors of the MCUSA and the riveting world of fascinating magical creatures inside Newt's briefcase. I felt I was in the shoes of Jacob, gawking as I discover all this for the first time. All the characters in the film are delightfully likable, particularly Newt and Jacob. Naturally introverted, Redmayne portrays Newt's shyness and innocence magically. His love for his creatures is contagious and we really connect with his passions. Fogler as his unlikely friend is equally brilliant, giving us most of the laughs in the film. The lovely ladies of the film - Waterson and Alison Sudol as her sister Queenie, their beauty and authenticity shines. The relationships they form with Newt and Jacob begins delicately, but we find that they're actually very compatible with each other. Colin Farrell shows his versatility as the villain Percival Graves. It was a little odd seeing him waving a wand instead of a gun, but he was nevertheless believable.Fantastic Beasts is extravagantly produced, especially in terms of its production and costume design. This, along with masterful CGI to bring the magical creatures to life and a vibrant score (James Newton Howard), the end product is a film that is visually enchanting. It also has plenty of heart, about love and friendships that could form at the most unexpected times. No matter how old you are, or whether or not you're a Harry Potter fan previously, it is a film that would bring joy and warmth to your heart."
" No plot or memorable characters
",-0.296,-0.4194,2017-02-12 00:00:00,3,"Sincere apologies to Potter fans, no offense intended. It has cute moments, but it's driven by plodding story lines and happenstance. The CGI is very over used, with little to no practical effects involved. Eddie Redmayne plays an animal rights activist that wants creatures to be free...so he keeps them trapped in his suitcase. He plays the character more than a little quirky, hardly ever looking at the person he's speaking to. He also may or may not do a mating ritual with a glowing rhino. (contender for most awkward movie moment of 2016) I would sum up the plot as an Asperger's patient playing Pokemon Go for 2 hours."
" Yet another beautiful tale
",0.5994,0.9713,2017-02-09 00:00:00,7,"J.K. Rowling knows what is going on in our world and what people really need these days. Exactly this is portrayed in this movie. You can read all the reviews of it; in fact this is my second review here, in response to a very negative one regarding the movie. If there are no character developments here, then there are neither in the Potter movies. I don't want to raise spoilers but I assure you this movie is - if not anything else, lovely. It touches your heart if you have ever felt anything shown in it. In an honest, innocent way, the way you do not learn at school, the way you can only grasp by experience or from a storyteller who knows how these emotions really work. It is not a Harry Potter movie and it should not be treated as such. It is the first part of a different story line in the same world. Of course it is not as profound but we still have four movies to go. But this movie's path is paved with the same principles as what we see in the Potter movies, it shows us moral and consequence. Also how to treat each other and everyone and everything else around us: with respect and love. We are in dire need for such stories. I have high hopes for the sequels which will along with this one - I really hope, show the qualities above for generations to come."

I fell in love with it! It brought me back to the magic and mystery of Harry Potter but it was also very original. Eddie Redmayne was so likable and sweet and unique and smart in this film and I fell in love with his character!! I fell in love with the other characters as well and it was such a great story!!! The beasts in this film are so unique and awesome and you want to learn more about them.

I first read harry potter when I was a 14 years teen. I used to dream about Hogwarts, getting an invitation from there.Most hilarious thing was, I used to chant the spells. I grew up, but craziness for this, never faded away. whoever loves Rowling's world, he or she will definitely love it. We all know a few about the great battle between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald.Just like the duel between Harry potter and Voldemort, this is also a famous battle in the wizarding world. As a H&P fan, I must thank Rowling and of course, David Yates, for this wonderful spin off! And, Eddie Redmayne, What's to say about him! Always keeps surprising with his prolific acting! Such a gem!"

But this movie had such a bad story, that in the end even the special effects couldn't make it up to a good impression. The characters have zero depths, the main is very hard to understand because of mumbling, important and unimportant story info is just thrown in without any previous explanation... The two good things were the special effects and the actors player reasonably well. But this can carry only so far in a movie and the plot really ruined it. For younger viewers this will be still a great watch I guess, but for anyone over 18 - be prepared for a very flat storyline whith bits and pieces scattered around!"

I still don't know who the blond guy was at the end and why he was hiding behind Colin Farrell's mask. This movie was nothing else, than a visual effects demo for the company who made them. I actually fell asleep and had to re watch the last third of the movie after I woke up. It was very well made for what it is and the acting was good, but that still doesn't make it a good movie."

I think he's one of the most over rated actors and constantly looks as if his mouth was frozen while saying ""Pork"". This means it's often difficult to understand what he's saying and I get tired of fighting to hear dialogue.Effects are OK. sets great, dialogue poor, acting mostly average, direction average and ability to captivate very low.

" Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: A Re-Entrance into the Magical World of Harry Potter
",0.5574,0.9847,2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"After a six-year Harry Potter deficit since the last Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter fans were rewarded with a new addition to the Magical Universe, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, plus its four future installations. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them once again captures and delivers the magical Harry Potter experience. Fans and moviegoers will once feel the captivation of magic as they watch the film, which for American viewers takes place in familiar territory, New York City.Like the critics, I agree that Fantastic Beasts appealed to my Harry Potter fanaticism. The film has deeper meaning as well, drawing parallels to animal rights, child abuse, social relationships, race relations, and feminism. First, Newt Scamander was one of the few wizards who truly cared for the magical beasts, and he devoted his life to protecting them because he knew that they were being hunted by people such as traders, merchants, and hunters. By writing his popular book, Scamander was able to save the lives of countless creatures because he had brought attention upon them. Similarly, in our society, there are certain groups of people who hunt animals for sport or for superficial benefit. Scamander is an animal-lover, representing today's few animal lovers. In the United States, such immoral practices such as captivating sea animals and forcing them to learn tricks to entertain an audience in Sea World continue, but should be stopped. Animals, like magical beasts, are meant to roam free in the wild, without fear of being killed by menacing, meddling humans. Moving on, child abuse is a subject of concern in the film. Clearly, Credence was extremely troubled, as he was regularly beat by his mother, Mary Lou, for minor actions such as coming home slightly late. He was an obedient child, and protected his sister, so he was abused by his mother, and eventually protected by Tina. Gradually, Credence showed greater signs of internal trouble and eventually manifested into the Obscurus, a dangerous creature. While this was part of the storyline, the problem of child abuse is outlined and demonstrates the problem of child abuse in society, and how it negatively impacts children when they grow up. Next, social relationships are displayed in the movie. Evidently, Newt Scamander was a shy, introverted person. He never looked anyone in the eye, but rather liked to keep to himself and his magical beast-friends. This was an aspect of his appearance I found significant because it accurately portrayed real people in society. Unlike the people in most films, not everyone is wild and extroverted. Having a shy Newt Scamander was appealing in its uniqueness. Next, race relations was exhibited as viewers saw the tensions between No-Majs and wizards. People such as Mary Lou were against witches and wizards, speaking against them. She was likely scared of them and their power. On the other side, wizards were not happy with humans such as Mary-Lou, and some people in the wizardly world even wanted to overpower the No-Majs and rule them. This is similar to society, as race relations can develop tensions as people get scared of another group and generalize group characteristics. This is not moral because people are all different, and cannot be all generalized. Not all magical people are dangerous or evil, for example, and not all people of a certain race are dangerous. Finally, this film relates to feminism with the strong roles of Tina, Queenie, and the head of the Magical Congress. Tina displays the struggle of the modern woman, unable to garner the attention of others, and mistaken as someone who doesn't know what she is doing. However, she helps Newt along with his journey, and becomes an indispensible character of fortitude and strength in the film. Queenie is seen as a confident, daring woman, similar in strength to Tina but in a alluring and feminine way, showing the meaning of feminism with a combination of feminine and feminist. The head of the Magical Congress, Madame President, is also a woman and is the most powerful witch of the government. This high position of power is rare for a woman, especially in the early 1900s time period where the film is set,considering not even today have we not had a a woman president. Finally, the movie had vivid, exciting visuals, finally allowing readers to understand what the beast of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack looks like, and the embarrassing yet endearing mating dance to attract it, by Newt Scamander.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a fast-paced film that brings viewers and fans back into the magical world of Harry Potter, with familiar stars such as Eddie Redmayne and Johnny Depp. Audiences will find deeper meaning rooted into the story, like all of J.K. Rowling's works, such as societal patterns and issues that continue today. J.K. Rowling has demonstrated an incredibly remarkable talent in her screen writing debut, and will continue to satisfy and thrill viewers for years to come about the magical world, fabricated from her creative mind. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has been nominated for two Oscars at the 89th Academy Awards, Best Production Design and Best Costume Design, and the sequel is set to be released in November 2018."
" Bloated, boring and ugly to look at.
",-0.6808,0.9958,2017-01-28 00:00:00,4,"I'm perplexed by the glowing reviews for ""Fantastic Beasts,"" as it seems to lack any of the wonder or warmth of the best of the ""Harry Potter"" movies. The titular beasts are not-so-fantastic, rather appearing as very garish, cartoonish CGI creations - instantly pulling us out of the film and its new world-building. Every set piece is just constructed with endless green screen and lazy computer effects. There's nothing exhilarating or awe-inspiring on display here - just one video game cut scene after another. (And I'm a video game fan, so I'm not belittling them; but the point is that as a movie with such an emphasis on visuals, there's nothing here that you haven't seen done much better, including on home gaming consoles.)Eddie Redmayne, one of the most overracted actors alive, is woefully miscast as Newt. He takes scenery-chewing to Nic Cage levels, minus the fun. Every facial expression, every little tic, is so overly calculated and overly accentuated that it begins to evoke memories of Simple Jack from ""Tropic Thunder.""Colin Farrell is stuck in another supporting role that doesn't play to his strengths, completely forgettable and generic. Ezra Miller seems to be in competition with Redmayne to see who can chew the most scenery - the kid is just awful. There's a not-so-secret cameo appearance that was announced before the movie hit theaters (ostensibly to counteract any potential fallout due to the actor's recent personal issues and allegations of doemstic abuse) - and this actor, who was once so talented, manages to ham it up even with just two pieces of dialogue, and leaves very little hope that he will be a menacing or charismatic villain in the (god help us) sequels to this movie.There are numerous supporting actors who seem tonally and aesthetically wrong for the 1920s setting - the whole crew of wizards, for example, look like a bunch of Abercrombie models playing Prohibition dress-up. You know how the undercut haircuts are all the rage right now, loosely based on haircuts from that era but upgraded with the skin fading, etc. that barbers back then did not have the means to do? Well, that's pretty much how everyone looks in this movie. Even Colin Farrell is rocking a hipster undercut that just distracts. Katherine Waterston is awesome. She looks the part, she puts Redmayne to shame as an actor, and she inspires a lot of faith for her role in ""Alien: Covenant."" She is the lone saving grace of this film.It's a shame about the rest of the performances and the glaringly poor CGI special effects, because honestly, the other attention to detail paid to the city and its era is pretty impressive - there are lone shots in the movie, the ones mostly devoid of the miserable SF/X, that are quite impressive and lovely to look at. The costumes for average city folk (less so the wizards...) are lovingly fashioned. There are hints here of what a great film this might have been in the hands of a better director, someone who didn't make a film as bad as ""The Legend of Tarzan,"" with a cast of actors who mostly aren't hamming it up and totally misfiring on every level.Maybe the sequel will rectify these issues."
" Review - Fantastic beasts and where to find them
",0.5574,0.802,2017-01-27 00:00:00,4,"Movie started with a nice music which reminds you that you are still part of harry potter universe. Then comes the big bad dark wizard to show his presence. The movie then takes a softer turn and introduces ""Newt"" (Eddie Redmayne), a young wizard with a bag full of beasts. A British in America. His acting was actually quite good. The beasts of Newt were visually spectacular and interesting.Then the dark mass was brought into story and Colin Farrel was after it. He was using a young boy to catch the mass to gain more power (can't tell you the whole story, can I?). The whole part was boring.Along the story line, Mr. Kowalski's character was introduced. His love story and mix up in all the magical story was better than most of the movie (including the magical congress of USA).What I liked most? Visual effects were very good and keeps reminding you of harry potter. The love story and humor of Newt and Mr. Kowalski was good. Revealing of the dark wizard at the end and the actor who played it was the best part. Nope.not telling you who he was, but he booked me for the upcoming second part of the movie.Overall, I think it was a bit of a disappointment. But the acting of all the characters was not bad."
" waste of time and space ... why they even made this crap ... is a ? to me
",-0.7003,0.9581,2017-01-26 00:00:00,6,"The story is very weak, the film seems like it was thrown together overnight. The plot was very weak, though there are some elements of good comedy. This film just seems like a cash cow to piggy back off Harry potter. All of the HP films were better than this. Think people voting this film way too high. The film is basically a wizard trying to find his pets whilst a terrorist wizard looks for some lame CGI obscurus. It doesn't even explain why hes looking for it. Yeah that's the whole film. Next to no story, just throws CGI creatures at us.I would have liked to see more of a magical world and a stronger story. The main villain only had a few minutes of air time at the very start and at the end. (Probably due to the amount he charges) But I guess this was aimed at a very young audience who love CGI creatures that they've never seen in the HP universe. Like the dragon thing that increases or decreases in size to fit the space. But in the suitcase they stay very small not fitting the available space. I feel they could have made this film a lot better if they focused more on the story line. Also the teleporting gimmick is way too strong. No wizard could do this in previous Harry potter films which are much further in time in the HP universe. So wizard's got much weaker than those of 1920/30's?"
" Fantastically Boring!!
",-0.4374,0.6402,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 and that is purely for the cgi ONLY!! The film itself never gets going. It's dull.The entire script is built around the magical creatures doing damage to NYC. Thats It!! I love Harry Potter but this is a major disappointment after waiting to see it for so long. You believe in the characters featured in the Harry Potter series, in this you don't know enough about them to give a s**t. Live, die who cares!! Dan Fogler's character is good, but could of been great. What a waste. I know as much about Newt now, as i did before watching the film. There is no character development. The story line is boring. The characters are boring. The beasts themselves are OK, but overall i expected more !!This film left me literally yawning, hoping it would get better. - IT DIDN'T!!Unfortunately there isn't one shining point to this film. Another pointless attempt at storytelling, devoid of any substance or creativity. Utterly disappointed."
" Great Addition To The Harry Potter Movies
",0.6249,-0.9563,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"From the mind of J.K. Rowling comes ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them,"" an amazing tale of the adventures of a young wizard (perfectly played by Eddie Redmayne) who goes to NYC in the 1920s in order to retrieve and find homes for fantastic, magical beasts that would otherwise be destroyed by the wizarding community.Redmayne will face many serious hurdles during his mission: not knowing how to navigate NYC (specifically Manhattan); being unfamiliar with the rules of the wizard community in NY; both wizards and non-wizards fearing the fantastic beasts and wanting them destroyed; and the wizarding community not sanctioning his search, capture, and release (into safe zones) of the beasts.A larger threat is a powerful force that wreaks destruction and death in NYC, threatening to unveil the wizarding world to the normal humans. A fantastic, magical beast is blamed; and Redmayne has little time left to prove to the wizards that the cause of the mayhem is some other, supernatural force. If Redmayne fails at what he must do, a war between normal humans and wizards may erupt; and all the fantastic beasts in Redmayne's care will be destroyed.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Redmayne and his wizard friend/love interest are sentenced to death, and we see the manner in which the execution is carried out. The executioners mention that it won't hurt, but I think it will! ""FBAWTFT"" was much better than I anticipated, and it is a very good companion piece to the ""Harry Potter"" movies. But it does suffer from two huge plot holes -- or shenanigans, as I like to call it -- that cannot be easily dismissed. The wizards have the power to reverse any damage to property, and remove memories of magical experiences by normal humans. In addition, the wizards can wreak such havoc upon the world and there is very little that the normal humans can do about it. One wizard can probably destroy a small country in a day. So why do the wizards fear having their existence revealed, and some possible war against the normal humans happening?Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Fantastic start of the Pentalogy.
",0.5574,0.9925,2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I am not going to lie, i went into the movie theater with such high hopes and the movie absolutely delivered! Honestly, what a beginning to this franchise. Let's talk a bit about the characters. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Newt Scamander is on point. I was sceptic at first, when i heard that he was cast to portray him, but his work on the screen proved me wrong. His gestures and body language are what really made his character so believable for me. Dan Folger as ""the fun pal"" Kowalski and Erza Miller as ""the main villain"" Credence did great job as well. But the biggest surprise and the best performance for me was Collin Farrell's. His portrayal of Percival Graves was so good, that when he was revealed as Grindelwald's Johnny Depp in the end, i almost felt bad, because that automatically meant, that Collin will not be returning for the sequels of this movie. One thing that i was certain about after finishing the movie, was that some viewers who are not a hardcore Harry Potter fans, would be complaining about the story's pacing. What i'd like to say to those people is that it was necessary. The exact word is necessary, because we had to believe Newt Scamander's love for magical beasts and their large amount and scale of existence in Harry Potter's world. What i can promise to those people, who really felt the plot like a let down or anything of that nature is that they have to be patient, because what's about to come will blow your mind. If David Yates stays true to the books, we are about to witness some of the greatest events before Harry Potter's birth and the greatest duel in wizarding history. Give this franchise a chance. If it didn't win you with the beginning, it will 100% with the next movie."
" Surprisingly Disappointing
",-0.25,-0.6689,2017-01-23 00:00:00,4,"As a real supporter and lover of the original Harry Potter films, I was more than excited to finally watch Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, but was severely disappointed. The movie lacked a clear plot until the final climax scene, which seemed to come out of nowhere, the dialogue was clumsy and stiff, and Eddie Redmayne, a normally incredibly gifted and talented actor, seemed strange and uncomfortable in his lead role, and was very hard to like, as he established strange and awkward relationships with the movie's supporting characters. Not only did the writers/director fail to relate Redmayne's character, Newt, to other, more relatable and likable characters, but they also did a lazy job of relating his character to the magical creatures he cared for, which might have saved the day. Overall, the film just seemed sloppy and not well planned, and I am very sad to say that I wouldn't recommend this one."
" It's not so fantastic.
",-0.5685,0.9911,2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Grab your wands, spell books, wizards and witches, because the world of 'Harry Potter' is back for the long haul with J.K. Rowlings' book 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to find Them'. This film is the first in a set of five upcoming movies and begins with a good amount of character introductions, but not necessarily origin stories. Instead of taking place in a somewhat modern day London or even that of the magical place of Hogwarts, 'Fantastic Beasts' takes place in the 1930s in New York, which is around the same time that King Kong would have been climbing buildings. So before Harry Potter himself was even born, this whole fantastic tale took place, which follows a young man named Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who travels from England to the USA to release a beast of a bird in Arizona to be free. Scamander is a bumbling and clumsy young man, so it's easy to see how and why he would lose his literal briefcase full of beasts out on New York, which is the main stage and story for the film.Meanwhile, there is an evil wizard named Gellert Grindewald who is on the loose and is one of the most dangerous and most evil wizards there ever was, along with a U.S. group that hates all wizards and witches that tries to take out Scamander and other wizards and witches. Scamander has some help on his quest with two sisters named Tina and Queenie Goldstein, who work for the U.S.A.'s version of the Ministry of Magic called the Magical Congress of the United States of America, which is mostly led by a sinister yet conflicted man named Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), who has taken to an abused young boy named Credence (Ezra Miller). Filmmaker David Yates is back in the director's chair again, as he will be for all five films.Yates knows the world of 'Harry Potter' very well, as he directed the last four 'Harry Potter' films, and leaves the kid jokes at the curb. 'Fantastic Beasts' is a very dark and sinister film, although it is filled with wonder and amazing creatures. What Yates and Rowling do well is fully immerse you into the magical world of wizards again, with different spells, fun buildings and creatures, and hints of bigger back stories that are not fully told yet. This setup of a film introduces us to some great characters and plot points that will be the focus of future films without giving much away here, which was a nice touch. There are some mentions of a few characters from the 'Harry Potter' films, but again, 'Fantastic Beasts' stands on its own and is fairly easy to separate the other movies from this.The world here is bleak and full of adult themes, leaving the funny kid jokes on the back burner, which I admit, I miss here, but the new comic relief comes from Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, who is a muggle whose dream is to open up a bakery. By just being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he is tangled up with Newt and this world of magic, and he steals every scene he is in. I really hope they bring him back for future films in a big way. 'Fantastic Beasts' is a great start to a new 'Harry Potter' franchise, despite the bleakness throughout the film.RECOMMENDED!"

" Such a disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.9659,2017-01-22 00:00:00,1,"I never leave reviews but the amount of disappointment I felt from this, was too immense. I felt ROBBED after watching this rather terrible,,,,,terrible movie. This reminded me of the movie The Golden Compass which I hated terribly. It had the same sort of magical creatures that look so unrealistic that you simply cannot delve deep into the movie because constantly you are reminded that this is a movie. The CG was even more unrealistic than before (is it just me or do the CGs get worse with the development of computer graphics). Honestly, they relied too much on CG and making the whole movie No-MAG like that it just seemed like AVATAR, which, by the way, I hated terribly as well. Honestly, this was such a disappointment that I was MAD after seeing it, and I can't believe they are making this look like a spin-off of the wonderful Harry Potter franchise because it does not have the depth nor the characters that we so deeply loved. It honestly has no connection to Harry Potter at all. What I hated most was that the plot was so stupid. Too many things happening at once and none of them being intriguing. The characters were so stupid, they made a terrible choice for the the main character Newt because he seems to be far too much an outcast but at the same time lacks the interesting or even lovable oddities that outcasts usually portray. All the characters were not memorable and they lacked depth so much to the point that I felt no attachment to any of them and I was confused on what side to root for. The climax of the movie ended so abruptly and pathetically that I literally felt like a leaking balloon. I cannot fathom how this movie has such a high rating, and I think that it is due to the fact that the desperate, crazed and very heartbroken fans of the Harry Potter franchise, who had dearly waited for a movie that contained the charm of Harry Potter, had cast their love upon anything and when that happened, a part of their souls latched itself onto the only living thing that resembled magic that it could find: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them itself."
" More of the same
",0.0,0.9945,2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"If you liked, let's say the last three Harry Potter films, you're going to enjoy this film just fine. It's cut very much from the same cloth, with excellent special effects, wizarding world oddities, unsuspecting muggles, wand-waving, all that jazz. Unfortunately it also shares a lot of flaws with those three movies. The colour palette is still pretty grim and dark, as is the general mood of the world. The characters are quirky and likable, but also rather one-dimensional or at least they don't grow a lot during the movies. The dialogue goes up and down in quality, though can be quite excellent in certain moments. And yes, dear J. K. Rowling, we get it. Bureaucracy is the root and symptom of all evil. All. Evil. Can we please move on to other subject matters because this is getting tedious.On the other hand the film does improve upon certain things. It's nice to see the American wizarding society, though as stated, it shares certain annoying similarities with the British one. All the eponymous fantastic beasts are simply fascinating and the movie broadens Rowling's world excellently. I also like that the main character Newt uses these critters in combat as well, because for some reason the makers of these films seem to think that magical combat has to consist of fast-flying coloured blobs of light. And nothing else!All this criticism aside, I cannot help but admit that I like the movie. I love the Harry Potter universe and I will see these movies however many they end up making. But that doesn't mean that I cannot point out the flaws. I love it that much."
" Magic Dr Who vs Arcane MiB
",0.0,0.9361,2017-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Written by Mrs Rowling, an author as successful as she is unimaginative, i.e., tremendously, this film happens in a city where wizards form a society of bureaucrats and Gestapo agents. Despite truly immense powers, they fear the non-magical, inferior race and hide from you mere humans, instead of teaching you and making babies with you. Anyway, I'm not sure how this works but I digress: the point is, the movie is full of Men in Black chasing illegal aliens throughout New York and lackadaisically wiping people's memories.Here lands an odd but friendly British wizard with awkward manners and a luggage much bigger on the inside. He soon finds a companion and on they go travel-ling through time... no, I'm kidding... through New York, chasing harmless but troublesome creatures. Still, the protagonist is so reminiscent of the Doctor that it could explain why I rather enjoyed most of the film.I really enjoyed the 4 main characters actually, the good guys; it's all fluff, well played and entertaining running and flirting. For the rest, well, it's not as if the writer plagiarised well known series so as to save her energy for other aspects of her craft: events more predictable than they come, dull villains, loose ends, amateur climax, endless epilogues... At the 2/3rd mark, the Beasts start to outstay their welcome."
" Surprisingly very entertaining
",0.659,0.8539,2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"I have to say that I saw this movie with apprehensions because so many bad comments from people I know that told me all kinds of things. I wanted to see it anyway because I simply don't trust others opinions. And once again, I was right. This movie is very good!I personally thought it was in a way better than the Potters' series because we actually SEE MAGIC, all the time, everywhere and a lot of action. In Potter's movie, the overall was based on the story because we had to understand the characters and their roles. In this movie, we know Newton Scamander already so the movie can be aimed at the subject, not the characters. Although that part too is covered, don't worry.I think this one could have lasted 3 hours without having any dull moments, it actually has a length of 2:13 hours and I can tell you I haven't seen the time go by.If you like action, fantasy, magic, intrigue, some really funny moments, you will enjoy this movie greatly.This is my opinion and I respect it!"
" Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a weak attempt at a Harry Potter revival, it's drive being to instill nostalgia and sadness
",-0.296,0.8802,2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"Eddie Redmayne was the highlight of the movie, and his superb acting skills helped the movie to elevate itself to the top of the box office (we don't know if that is true). The movie had magical elements, which included magic, wands, and apparating. It was truly a stellar motion picture that children will find entertaining! However, parents, be warned that there are some frightening scenes between a child named Credence and his inner soul. We highly suggest you walk into the movie with this knowledge. Other than that, A+++++++! P.S. My associate, Mickfleigh, deems that this movie merely triggers nostalgia in the hearts of Harry Potter fans, and a Harry Potter marathon is recommended to follow immediately afterwards."
" Expecto Samethingicus
",0.0,0.9976,2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"I saw this movie a few nights ago and i found it enjoyable up to a certain degree. I like certain parts about it, and disliked other parts. As is tradition: Good sides first, bad sides later.Good sides: A fun new story: The story on itself was enjoyable enough. Newt Scamander arrives in New York with a briefcase full of the most outrageous and fantastic beasts known and unknown to man. But then... a few escape and he finds himself to be arrested for doing it on purpose. Dunn.. Dunn. DUUUNNNN Rowling's Imagination: we are once again astounded by the fantasy that J.K. Rowling has to offer to us. The animals are as crazy and as adorable and as awesome and as cute as you can think of... and possibly even more so. It is truly fun and mind-blowing to see that she has made this world come alive and i agree with one of the muggles: ""I know i'm dreaming, because i don't have the brain to make this up."" New lands to explore: We get to see a new side to the Wizarding World that JK has created, besides just seeing Hogwarts in England. This time it is New York and how the magic society works there. Effects: The special effects and the animals that are there in the movie look truly amazing. The special Effects department did an amazing job to make everything look real.Now for the bad parts, because it does have those too. Same Things happen: I must say that despite the fun story, it was predictable. Main guy gets in trouble, the Ministry goes after him and only makes things worse. They react as you would expect. They don't trust the main character and say he is out of line when suggesting something even a little bit crazy... You live in a magic world! Nothing should be too crazy for you! We are also again confronted with problems that should not be there in the Magic World. You have an entire world in your suitcase? Why do you need a place to stay? Same humor: I'm not sure if this is to blame on JK, or on the director David Yates, but we have the exact same feeling and scenes as the last 4 Harry Potter movies. The same type of acting, the same type of emotions (or lack thereof), the same type of awkward moments. It is the same thing again. There is little new in that regard. You watch the same movie, just a different setting and story. Special Effects: It is also listed as a good thing, yet i'd also like to point out that the movie heavily relies on that. In the first few Harry Potter movies the special effects were only a part of it, not the backbone of the movie. That has changed now. The real 'magic feeling' is gone, so now the directors and producers need to make it look good for it to stay interesting.All in all i liked the first time watching, but i must say that it will take a while before i will see it again. The awkward acting and the same type of pacing is difficult to enjoy after 30 minutes of the same.There is no natural feeling to the movie. I felt like i was watching a scene-book. You don't watch an entire movie that is put together perfectly so that one scene flows over into the other. You're watching scene 1. Scene 2. Scene 3 and so on and so on.6 i can give it. a 7 is a bit too much."

As Yates delivers a refreshing and whimsical film. Sure, it doesn't have the characters we've come to love, but with the creatures you encounter and with the added humor of J.K Rowling, you will come to grip with the fact that this movie will leave an impression. Best movie with stun technique drawing.In 1926 the British wizard and ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander arrives by boat to New York City en route to Arizona. Newt Scamander brought with him a suitcase with abundant of magical creatures. a Niffler escapes from his magically expanded suitcase and Newt Scamander attempts to capture it, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they accidentally swap suitcases.

However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her Legilimens sister. Queenie and Jacob are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to marry or even socially interact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters abundant magical creatures. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After re-capturing two of the three escaped beasts, they re-enter the suitcase, which Tina takes to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts is responsible for killing Senator Henry Shaw Jr. They decide to destroy Newt's suitcase and erase Jacob's recent memories. Director of Magical Security Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death, but Queenie and Jacob rescue them. Meanwhile, Percival Graves (the highest official in wizard community) approaches Credence Barebone, Mary Lou's adopted son, and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, he wants Credence to find an Obscurus. Graves believes it has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Mary Lou found Credence's wand, but Modesty claims it is hers. When she is about to be punished, the Obscurus is unleashed, killing everyone except Modesty and Credence. Graves arrives and dismisses Credence as being a Squib (a non-magical person of wizard ancestry), and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the Obscurus' host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a rage, he unleashes the Obscurus upon the city.Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle into human form, Picquery and Aurors arrive. Picquery decides Credence must be executed to protect their magical society, but a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. Finally, Graves is revealed as Grindelwald which is criminal in wizard community.

",0.6705,0.9857,2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,"First of all I am a huge Potter fan so I already prepared to watch this with a hint of trepidation but as a big fan of Redmayne I didn't stall too long to watch. First of all its too long , potter films generally are but the books require it. Secondly it doesn't look like a potter film to me and the use of potter spells and dumbledores name felt a little forced. I also Absolutely love the fact that HP is definitively British and whilst New York in the 20's is as good a setting as any why not just develop the potter universe in England? Farrell is average I am not a fan of his so would have taken a lot to convince me otherwise. The film also looks like it's building to something but doesn't deliver, it opens the door to countless options and franchises so there's opportunity to improve but this was not a great start for me! The positives are it looks terrific the main characters queenie, newt Jacob etc are solid in their own right and will probably feature in the future. But for me revert back to the uk bring back Potter actors Gambon Maggie Smith etc and restore the universe to its done self."

I watched it to the end, and felt like I'd been duped into spending my money to see a film built on the backs of the other Harry Potter films... and if they're seriously considering doing sequels I would reconsider ... I wouldn't recommend going to see the film if you're going in the hope of seeing a brilliant storyline.. I would recommend if you are just watching it for the special effects which in my opinion are fantastic."
" Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016)
",0.5574,0.9956,2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I read the books as a teenager and was enamored with the wizarding world that JK Rowling managed to create. The films aren't without flaws but they were very enjoyable for the book lovers and casual movie fans alike. The films were enjoyable for adults and children alike. Initially, I didn't care for a spin off or prequel to the Harry Potter franchise; I didn't need anything in that magical universe anymore. I was of the opinion that Rowling should have closed that chapter of her life and focus on a more unique project. However, I still decided to check it out as I heard many people enjoyed this film.I'm sad to say that I did not like it anywhere near as much as the Harry Potter films. The first hour of this film seemed so inconsequential and bland. There's an overabundance of CGI usage to depict some of the beasts. While some scenes with the beasts look great, others looked so reliant on CG that it was distracting and takes you out of the picture. The first hour of the film focuses on introducing the beasts that escaped Newt Scamander's briefcase. I quit the film an hour in because I was sorely disappointed with what I saw.After getting back to the film, I'd say the film gets stronger in the second phase. Once the severity of the Obscurus is revealed the film becomes a bit darker and engages the audience more. There are still questions to be asked and I expect them to be answered in the trilogy (I'm not very fond of the idea of sequels to an unnecessary film). While the film gets better, it still carries none of the charm and fun that made the Harry Potter films so special. The HP films had a purpose and you knew that everything was well thought out, I can't say the same for a very uneven FBAWTFT.I'm not the biggest Eddie Redmayne fan. He can put in a tremendous performance but isn't in many films that I really like. He was a considerably weak leading man. Its hard to get invested in his character who is just there and becomes second to whoever else he is on screen with. Katherine Waterston is committed to her role and was one of the best features of this film. There seems to be other characters who are kind of thrown into the film to serve the plot. There are also a few easy way outs in this film. Something big gets solved by a convenient circumstance that gets explained on the spot.This film failed to make a good impression. It has prolonged action sequences and an introduction of many new types of beasts, however outside of a few references to the HP universe the film just feels like it doesn't need to exist. I don't have a lot of faith in the expected trilogy but its going to exist and I pray that it is better. Right now this film is what The Hobbit was to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. LOTR was great and we absolutely did not need The Hobbit trilogy. These beasts and this films concept do not need finding.6/10"
" The adventures of Danish Transvestite and his Jewish platypus
",0.34,0.9502,2017-01-16 00:00:00,2,"I have few major problems with this movie. Them being:1) The characters. None of them are interesting. None of them stands out in any way. They are all just grey mass not worth of caring about. Even thought this movie focuses on adults, 11 years old Harry Potter and his story are infinitely more mature than this movie.2) The Harry Potter universe. It wasn't this meh and uninteresting, not ever. I am sure at least 50% of Harry Potter fans could create a better story to take place in Potterverse than FBAWTFT is. I have no other way to describe the world building than the word ""awful"". 3) The spells. Most of them look pretty lame and cheap CGI even in the first Harry Potter movies. In FBAWTFT's case it looks like they made their target audience younger because only young people could find these special effects impressive or cool. They look mainly awkward. 4) Politics. Oh god, the politics. Thought the politics and media were bad in Harry Potter? Justice system sucked? The ministers of magic being a liars and all the press backing up corrupt leaders? Court working solely on elite's favor? FBAWTFT showed that this is still the case. The leaders are baddies. This time it isn't that annoying/personal because a) you don't care and b) it is so bad.I even have to make second paragraph about the politics because they play such a big part of this movie yet are extremely unfitting to its universe. The movie takes place in the 1930's and its take on life in those days is one-dimensional and cliché. The take is so black and white it almost seems like propaganda. The political side of this movie makes it half a political thriller -similar to Captain America. If you don't know, Captain America is a political thriller according to its fandom. Actually it is action movie for children. FBAWTFT is a lot like that, except it lacks action and adventure... making it just a political thriller.. which totally is not a political thriller. At this point, I have no idea what this movie is or tries to be.Also, This review comes from a person who grew up with Harry Potter and whose life Potterverse has played a huge part in."
" CGI Galore
",0.0,0.9882,2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"Lots of weird cgi-created creatures (well done), story-line meh, character-development or -likeability compared to the Harry Potter movies also meh, acting okayish. Conclusion: Fantastic Beast and Where To Find Them is no fiasco or total fail but lacks of real substance and I would have preferred a more daring approach storylike. Why not telling the story of bad ass Lord V. and/or the parents of Harry Potter, or the lifetime story of Dumbledore, or at least something like Mr. S. hunting fantastic beasts across the globe in peculiar spots. Anyway, most of those beasts it seems to me are already in the fantastic suitcase of Scamanders, so we missed all the adventures of hunting and collecting those creatures... Somehow this movie reminds me of Mr. Lucas - he wrote and made movie-history with his first trilogy of Star Wars and then, well lets be tender, he lost a lot of his capability to write anything resembling an interesting and captivating story. I got to say of all the possibilities to expand the Potter-universe Mrs. Rowling voted imo for a bad (boring) option. This flick is imo a lot like Disneys versions of Alice in Wonderland - you get a lot for your eyes but not much for your mind and heart. And ofc you get the obligatory Depp in it. The 2+ hour movie tasted like a chewing gum to me - the longer I had to chew it, the more it tasted like blabla. Next."
" For fans of the fantastic
",0.5574,0.7168,2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Small disclaimer: I was never a huge fan of the Harry Potter books or movies. I think I was maybe just a little bit too old when they came out, because I really like fantasy and I tried very hard to like them. Read three books and got bored, watched two movies and got bored.That's why I was surprised to like Fantastic Beasts so much. A large part of that is due to Eddie Redmayne, who is simply brilliant in his role as Newt Scamander, the wizard obsessed with magical beasts and protecting them. Reminded me a little of Gerald Durrell, whose books I read over and over again growing up (or maybe Steve Irwin, if you've never heard of Gerald Durrell). Socially awkward and distracted, it is delightful to watch him become confident and authoritative when interacting with the beasts he loves so much.His story is quite a simple one, trying to catch the beasts that escaped while on his way to Arizona, but it plays out against a much larger backdrop of political intrigue as suspicion and paranoia build in the wizards' community, who are deathly (and reasonably) afraid of having their existence exposed to ordinary humans."

",0.0,0.9902,2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Just 25 minutes into the movie, and I thought, this is so much better than Harry Potter, or should I say, Popper. I know that many adults loved the Harry Potter movies and/or books, mostly because we are still kids at heart. Not that there's anything wrong with it :) Childhood was mostly great too. However, movie after movie and/or book after book, it was childish, albeit Harry Potter and his friends kept growing, the story, nonetheless, remained the same. Great! No quarrels there! But this is better; Fantastic Beasts is so much more intelligent, and entertaining to boot. It's almost magical, and the almost is key since the movie never becomes childish. Excellent acting and directing, amazing visuals, and based on a terrific book by the same author, beautiful J. K. Rowling."
" Entertaining Adventure
",0.6369,-0.978,2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the magician Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) comes to New York City. While listening to the speech of the non-maj Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) telling that witches and wizards are dangerous, he lets a Niffler escape from his magical suitcase. Newt tries to capture the creature in a bank, but he stumbles upon the non-maj Jacob Kowalski (Dan Folger), who is a cannery worker unsuccessfully trying to raise a loan to buy a bakery. Newt captures the Niffler but he accidentally swaps his suitcase with Jacob. The former Auror Tina Golstein (Katherine Waterson) arrests Newt since he has not registered as a wizard in New York and brings him to the MACUSA. However, when she opens his suitcase, she finds only donuts and baked goods. Newt is released but his creatures flee from his suitcase at Jacob's apartment. When Newt and Tina find Jacob, Newt wants to obliviate his memory but Tina decides to bring him to her apartment since he is wounded and confused. She introduces her sister Queenie (Alison Sudof) to Newt and Jacob, and Queenie and Jacob feel immediately attracted by each other. During the night, Newt brings Jacob with him through the magical suitcase to help him to search for the creatures that are missing. However Tina takes the suitcase to the MACUSA and they are arrested since she believes one of Newt's creature is the responsible for killing a senator. However the wizard Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) accuses Newt of conspiracy with the notorious wizard Gellert Grindelwald and Newt and Tina are sentenced to death. What will happen to them?""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is an entertaining adventure with a flawed story. For example, why Newt needs to travel by ship if he may move using his magic? The cast is excellent, highlighting the cameo of Johnny Depp. The CGI is top-notch and despite the running time, the viewer does not feel bored. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Animais Fantásticos e Onde Habitam"" (""Fantastic Beasts and Where They Live"")"
" Fantastic meh and where to yawn and meh

It isn't bad but doesn't make you want anymore. And I think that is why they had to shoehorn Johnny Depp in at the end of this, because otherwise no one would care enough to watch a sequel. The dude playing the wizard looking for his pets is meh. The story felt like filler. I honestly have no idea why people consider this film anything other than mediocre. I guess die-hard Harry Potter fans are so desperate for more Harry Potter stuff on the big screen that they are willing to pretend this film is something special when it really isn't."

I can also understand why it was set in New York , it opens up a whole new chapter(s) for its biggest market and this has already recouped it's $180m budget. The CGI and recreation of late 1920s NYC was amazing . Great cast and a beautiful love story between Jacob and Queenie . Colin Farrell's was excellent and he the wittiest line 'put down those wands' interesting cameo in there too .Overall this was a good film , thoroughly entertaining , 7.5/10 not quite an 8/10 with the love interest between Jacob and Queenie the unexpected added bonus particularly after the negative line 'who would marry him' Enjoy"
" Welcome Back, Wizards
",0.4588,0.9894,2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"As a Harry Potter fan, it is hard to judge ""Fantastic Beasts"" without comparison to the Potter films. Fantastic Beasts has its own magic and charm, but gone are the supporting characters--Dumbledore, Snape, the Dark Lord, etc, which made the Potter stories so good. I can't see any of the characters introduced in ""Beasts"" as stepping into those roles. Colin Farrell does well as the dark magic heavy; Eddie Redmayne is great as Newt, the Zookeeper. As usual these days in Hollywood the special effects carry the day and make what was an OK movie into a very watchable one. They say this story arc has five more movies and I would imagine they'll take the story right up to the birth of Mr Potter. Should be fun!"
" Mostly for children
",0.0,0.9806,2017-01-11 00:00:00,5,"Finally got to see Fantastic Beasts last night as the new releases haven't quite reached our multiplex yet. Had a feeling that this film was mainly aimed at children and that was certainly confirmed. The stars of the film are undoubtedly the fantastic beasts. Even Eddie Redmayne as Newt is very much the supporting actor to the beasts. Fairly certain that this is exactly the way the kids will like it and quite sure that the 7-13 year olds will love it. The romantic tension between Newt and Tina was also completely lacking and again very much aimed for the younger audience. The script and story play second fiddle to the fantastic beasts, but there's always something interesting going on, so it's fairly entertaining. The people who have been brought up on Harry Potter may also enjoy the film as there are the occasional Hogarts references scattered through the film."

The film has no pacing at all, the cast should be ashamed to have taken the money to be in something which is no more than a CGI fest. Some of which - including the ending scenes are even taking the mickey out of that - The film is boring, the characters have no empathy with each other, the love interests risible, practically none of the creatures have any personality at all. the scenes are chaotic and move between locations with no discernible logic. This is no doubt the worst thing I have ever sat through and seemed endless.I would have left early had I not been stuck in an end of row seat. I needed a drink to recover from the sheer frustration of sitting through it."

The movie is a promising one with more of the world of Harry Potter from the US, with more creatures and with more characters. I have to admit some parts of the movie were like a lecture on the beasts and I found myself in a Care of Magical Creatures Class (no complaints from me, but people may find that a bit boring). But, the overall story line was written in a harmony with the original Harry Potter books. And Johnny Depp as Grindewald was especially a nice touch in the end. Finally, why don't we have more of Harry Potter when we have this more money and popularity seeking Marvel, DC extensions. I mean wouldn't we want more of the quality Harry Potter universe when we see insanely cheap superhero movies. (such as Batman vs Superman)?"

" Rowling meets superheroes
",0.0,0.9875,2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"I've seen all the Harry Potter movies, courtesy of my 20 yr old daughter growing up with the saga. HP's beauty was all about these young characters growing up in a challenging world. Magic helped making it fascinating, but never came close to overcome the characters and their story. In a way, one would exit the theater thinking the real world is not so different from Hogwarts, if you are able to look carefully into it. Fantastic Beasts is a completely different piece of work, like a B superhero movie transposed in a JK Rowling setting. Characters are thinly developed, a plethora of magic animals are introduced without any real explanation or meaning, and the only thing remaining are stunning but repetitive special effects. It may be a crowd pleaser, but certainly not something JK Rowling will be remembered for."
" It's actually kind of offensive...
",0.0,-0.8172,2017-01-02 00:00:00,2,"I just watched Magical Beasts and where to find them and I'm really turned off by the American Wizards.1. The bad fake New York accents.2. They all wear 1920s clothes, perfectly mundane 1920s clothes .Why do the British Wizards get to wear the cool eccentric robes but American wizards dress so plainly? And ""No Maj"" is really, really irritating.3. Finally, the British Wizards have no death sentence but American wizards kill pretty eagerly. They know New York isn't Texas, right?!? Also why do the Wizards reflect the No Maj / Muggle politics? I would have hoped wizards (as they can travel anywhere very quickly) would have a more unified culture. And America wouldn't be treated as a uber modern / strict / harsh place. They need permits to have a wand?! And again... Why don't they wear robes? These are European descended wizards. Why wouldn't they have robes yet in the UK wizards wear traditional Wizard garb all the time. I feel J. K. Rowling is showing some innate bigotry against Americans here that has depleted the whimsy factor and made this portion of the wizarding world unnecessarily cold, sterile, and in certain aspects idiotic.And don't get me started on their rules about wizards not being allowed to interact with ""No Maj."" God, I hate that term... America's English developed differently from the original British English partly thanks to the Webster Dictionary changing particular words. So WHY would Wizard slang be different?! It makes no sense! Perhaps someone should have shown her the Halloweentown movies from the Disney Channel featuring the late Debbie Reynolds. That was Harry Potter-esque yet set in America without taking away the whimsy and sense of Old World magical charm. And didn't require turning Americans into vaguely obnoxious stereotypes. It was charming despite the low budget. The wizards in America SHOULD have behaved just like the ones in the UK. People are people no matter where you are, after all. We are all human. Skip this. And re-watch Halloweentown in Debbie Reynolds memory. You won't regret it.Also ""I have trouble reading Brit minds because of the accent."" WTF!???"

JK is rolling in clover and one wouldn't grudge her that, but recycling the wide-eyed characters of Harry Potter films requires no imagination. This film left us literally yawning, hoping it would get better. No luck there.Many, many movies are escapist entertainment, rather than high art. That's okay, Hollywood does amazing things with sound and images, and the product doesn't always have to be profound to be well worthwhile. However, this rehash was as entertaining as television wrasslin', with none of the charmingly ingenious characters.Ideal if you're entertaining very young children. Aside from that, less fun than watching people at the mall."

The main character Mr. Scamander is excellent. His acting is very natural, suited to a person of Witch world, or a graduate of Hogwarts, introvert and scientific oriented. I liked this movie, but it is not kind of soul-touching movie. Funny, simple, science-fiction, fantasy. Start of the movie is excellent. End is also excellent. In between, it gets a bit boring, but attracts curiosity and questions in mind throughout. Movie is the continuity of Hogwarts magic emblem including the ministry of magic, Hogwarts praise, magic wands, magic spells, Non-Maj or Muggles, hidden magic world.

" Review proof, to be honest.
",0.5106,-0.3315,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"J.K.Rowling has such a strong fan base that any movie based in her magical world is essentially a licence to print money. After eight films from seven books we've also had a sequel of sorts (The Cursed Child) and now a prequel of sorts.Written by Rowling herself in her first screenplay, the film concerns Newt Scamander, a minor figure in the original novels.The movie clearly has a huge budget ($180m) and it shows on the screen. Beautifully detailed settings and costumes (1920's Manhattan) and excellent special effects don't come cheap and yet here they are.Of course it would be nice to report that the thing is a triumph, but there are a few problems.To start with - the script. There seems to be at least three or four different movies going on at once here. Newt and his chums seem to be in one of those animal adventure movies where people capture wild beasts and then deal with them back at the compound - sort of like ""Hatari!"", but with wands. There's the heroic Newt, the no-nonsense girl sidekick, her sister with the heart of gold and, in the Gabby Hayes comic relief role, the would be Baker who is non magical and so, conveniently needs to have everything explained to him, which makes him extra popular in the exposition scenes. Then we have the doings back at the Mission House where a religious fanatic mother has to discipline (read ""abuse"") her wayward charges until one who has hidden dark powers gets their own back with fatal consequences. It plays a bit like ""Carrie"", although there's no bucket of pig's blood involved.Then there's a really quite undeveloped bit about a family of a wealthy Newspaper Proprietor whose has two sons, one running for the Senate (in scenes that suggest he's running against Boss Jim W Gettys) and one who appears to be a wastrel and a disgrace to the family name. (I kept thinking of Groucho in ""Horse Feathers"": ""You're a disgrace to our family name of Wagstaff, if such a thing is possible."")And then there's the Magic stuff which seems to lack the charm that was found in Hogwarts. This movie is set in America and American Magic just seems nastier than the English kind. There's segregation to the point of apartheid, the death penalty used without a blink of an eye, registration of immigrants, black market animal trading... it all seems a bit dark and vicious. Colin Farrell gets to look all brooding and glowering as ""Mr Graves"" and rushes about waving his wand dramatically and threatening durance vile and a fate worse than death to our heroes. These four different films keep rubbing up against each other in a variety of ways, seemingly in the hope that sooner or later the resultant friction might ignite something that passes for a plot.It probably doesn't, but there's certainly a lot of sound and fury and CGI and people do things that are intended as excitement and at the end everyone realises what fools they've been not to listen to our hero all along and the sensible no nonsense girl surprises us and herself when she realises that she really can't live without him and Johnny Depp shows up and the movie ends. There are, apparently, four more to come.And then there's the gender politics of it all. Was I the only one who found the scenes where Mr Graves takes Credence out into the back alley to share ""their secret"" a bit dodgy? There's so much hugging and face stroking and whispered ""I just want what's best for you"" going on between a powerful middle aged man and a vulnerable teenager that it gets to be a bit.... well... dubious.I've read that Graves is acting in ""a fatherly way"", but then comes the genuinely shocking moment (perhaps the only genuine shock in the film) where Graves slaps the boy across the face. Presumably ""in a fatherly way"".Potterworld is, let's face it, resolutely heterosexual. Hogwarts must be the only boarding school in the known Universe where no teen aged student has ever developed a crush on another same sex student. There's not even a flamboyant art teacher. Dumbledore, we are told, is gay, but since there's no actual indication of this in either book or film that hardly counts. And he needn't have been played by Kenneth Williams (""Hello, I'm Dumbledore and this is my friend Sandy."") to get the point across.Sure, the strong women role models are all there in spades. Hermione, Mrs Weasley, Professor McGonagall, Ginny are all strong, independent role models for girls. The President in this new film is a powerful woman - and a powerful woman of colour at that. Rowling gives all sorts of kids who read the books someone to relate to. A bit nerdy and getting picked on? You could grow up to be a hero like Neville. A high achieving girl who gets pressure to be ""more feminine""? Say hello to Hermione. Asian or black and trying to fit in? The Patels and Cho Chang are just what you need. Gay and worried about coming out? Well, there's...... well...... sorry, you're on your own.And now there is a relationship on screen that could be seen as homosexual and it's age inappropriate, abusive and manipulative. Really?"
