" Could have been better, significant goofs
",0.5719,-0.9563,2020-10-28 00:00:00,5,"The storyline is good- A paraplegic girl on recovery goes to stay with her estranged father at his lone mansion in the woods, wherein strange happenings begin, with a presence that does not want Jesse, but then there's more to what meets the eye.The film stars on a good note, has a few spooks and scares, and it could have been better but gets more illogical and meaningless towards the latter 1/4th.One major goof towards the end is - it is shown that Jesse's angry father Leon kills his wife Kate's illegitimate baby born from Moses and throws it in the lake, but how then does Kate manage to conduct a voodoo ritual with Moses' African witch doctors and bury the same baby in a grave ????? Seriously this is too illogical.The filming is commendable, ideal for a horror setup. Acting is good by all actors, but the ending.....nah... That was not ideal.5* is fair enough a rating."
" Why Such Good Romance?
",0.7579,0.9787,2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Why is it that there are so many horror movies with cute couples in it? STOP. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite movies. Not that it's ground breaking or anything but it's just a simple concept that's exacted nicely. The acting leaves a bit to be desired but I think the main actress fits the role perfectly. I think what keeps me coming back to watch this movie is that it's a good ghost story with a interesting, unseen twist. I think it's good at it is and if you don't expect more from it then you'll enjoy it."
" Not a bad movie at all
",0.431,0.9667,2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"Do watch this movie, the plot is really good and unexpected. I thought its going to be some normal teen scream movie but the story blew me away completely. Again this movie doesnt have many jumpscare scenes. The ending was really good. Sarah Snook was outstanding. This movie deserves better ratings to be honest!"
" Nonsense ending
",-0.4019,0.0,2020-09-26 00:00:00,2,"The movie finally took an interesting turn in the end and bamm it ruined everything.
I mean wtf is this ending. ""Take me home, my love"""
" ""Swampbound Wheelchair""
",0.0,0.7823,2020-09-09 00:00:00,3,"Empty watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend.I basically gave this a shot because Sarah Snook looked cute and it was a horror movie I hadn't heard about. I had really expected it to get a lot better from there. Sadly it doesn't.The opening sequence is an odd choice, but it's just a mechanic to get her in a wheelchair, which I really wanted to love, but it is used a cheap way to debilitate her and add to a fear of helplessness when it sort of does the opposite. As someone who has had to use a wheelchair before, it separates the character from most of the audience because they don't have that frame of reference: it's alienating usually. The movie has to be really good and draw the audience to relate to the character before they can overlook things that seem foreign to them.There are some really good sequences with the ghost, and it actually reminded me of ""Evil Dead"" quite a bit, but it did sort of devolve into what looks like two girls mud wrestling, so I'm hoping that wasn't a factor.The story is all jumbled and clunky in how it's told so it ruins all the parts that would make it interesting, but even with a good mystery / twist, I think the movie would have been average at best, and instead it's a waste of time. There are so many better movies out there to watch."
" Not memorable, but decent way to kill time
",-0.8201,-0.5423,2020-08-04 00:00:00,6,"The scary scenes weren't exactly scary, and the climax was pretty meh. I gave it extra stars for decent cinematography and acting."
" An okay film with a decent enough twist
",0.2263,0.1147,2020-07-05 00:00:00,4,"The film isn't terrible. The acting is adequate and there are a few scares. I suppose my biggest gripe comes from the fact that I have lived in the area seen in the film my entire life and weird voodoo rituals and altars really don't exist. Too much of the film is over the top and neither Jessabelle nor her ""father"" are likable to really care about. If you like ghost stories with the back drop of crime and drama I recommend it. If you find convoluted over telling ghost stories, skip it."
" A bit of a muddled snooze-fest
",0.0,-0.9953,2020-04-06 00:00:00,4,"Jessie (Snook) is moving into her boyfriends house and is also expecting a child. Shortly after leaving her old house behind they are involved in a car accident, her boyfriends pickup being t-boned by a large truck. Jessie awakes in hospital only to be told that unfortunately her unborn baby did not survive. Neither did her boyfriend. Two months later after much rehabilitation and treatment, she is allowed to go home, or more relevantly, to her fathers home to continue her recuperation.Jessie's dad Leon (Andrews) lives in an isolated house by a river. The house is old, dilapidated and a little creepy (as these houses always are). Dad does not speak much and he tells Jessie that she can stay in her mothers old room. Her first night back home is restless and it appears that she may be seeing things too. The next morning it Jessie is home alone, and while looking around comes across some video tapes that her mother made for her before she was born. The contents of which become more chilling.Ok now the first thing wrong with this film is the audio. I moan time and time again about bad audio and here's another film that just gets it all wrong. The music is far too loud for the dialogue, along with the area affects and background ambience. Everything drowns out what is being said and it quickly becomes annoying. It is also badly equalized, with the loud sections bursting your eardrums while seconds later you are turning up the volume.The acting is passable if nothing spectacular but then none of them have a great deal to do, with the exception of Snook. Snook is actually a reasonable actress but the material and direction given to her here is not the best. The script is very lazy and quite simplified and the story tries to use jump scares more than intelligence or actual good film making to build atmosphere. Unfortunately (if you rely on them) most of these jump scares miss their mark and fail, resulting in a rather weak dull story that plods along with no real pace.Jessabelle is also jam-packed full of inconsistencies with many things seeming rather absurd and pointless. I won't go into the main part of the plot and its twist, but really, why wait twenty years? Just completely nonsensical in every way (other than for making this dumb movie). Set in Louisiana, the fake accents begin to grate very quickly, it is a real shame they couldn't find a suitable filming location and had to film in another state. Not sure why though, when most of the film is shot in the interior of a house (or set design of one).In the end it is difficult to be kind to this movie as there is not a lot going for it and plenty going wrong with it, though I have certainly seen worse films this year alone. If you're bored one night then stick it on to help get some shut-eye, otherwise give this one a miss.
The Sage's Rating: 4/10"
" Not a bad horror film. Nearly! Lots of good aspects. Too many poor ones. Spoilers at end of my thoughts!
",0.7377,-0.9989,2020-01-27 00:00:00,4,"Not a bad movie IMO. I enjoyed it mostly. Small amount of characters in movie and they all did an excellent job especially excellent the father role Plot holes? Yes. What movie doesn't? But like all good movies they can be easily disregarded. Building anxiety with the unknown elements slowly developed with what I found the more that was explained the more it wasn't or more uncertainty building. But not all to slow or more uncertainty becoming frustrating, very well paced. Almost all story in one location which was done very well. BUT... SPOILER BELOW!The ending did not work for me at all. When Jess is revealed to be Jess only and not Jessabelle the ending fell apart for me. Jess it is explained was probably adopted as the white mother had a baby with a black lover. White father is furious as colour of baby confirms his wife has had a lover who is babies father and brutally kills Jessabelle and her real father. Mother than had died from her illness though I wasn't sure whether the husband played some part in her death. The role of the voodoo became quite confusing for me. And in this day and age the misinterpretation of voodoo being all evil, chicken sacrifices and curses etc is outdated as the Voodoo beliefs is as far as I am aware based on Christianity. Still this would be acceptable (within a horror movie) with the death of the father as he was horrific a baby and adult murderer.
But at the conclusion when under a voodoo curse Jess pushes herself into the lake, believing her mother was pushing her tied in to the wheelchair, I thought it was just going to be some kind of cleansing when Jessable kissed her on the forehead the curse would be released untied to the wheelchair and she would swim to the surface both mentally and physically both Jess and Jessable at peace with the past. Even then it would not have made total sense as she was totally innocent of the violent and evil precedings but hey, it is a horror film. But no! She is mentally drowned and vacted her body taken over by Jessable. Despite Jess herself being totally innocent of any crimes or evilness. With such an abhorrent ending all the plot holes just become too much. How did a pregnant woman who gave birth to a baby be quickly allowed to adopt another baby so quickly. Why was Jessable's murder not be investigated by police and why didnt Jessable's mother tell the police? Because she feared her husband was going to kill her even though she was dying anyway? Jess being totally innocent of anything but her mother and her lover BOTH be insane enough to kill her as a grown woman from beyond the grave to resurrect their child? Jess was wary of her unstable and aggressive to the man she thought of as her father but she still had to be killed for his crimes. Wouldn't Jess's love of high school days notice a huge personality change when Jessable occupied her body? Plenty more unconvincing or ludicrous parts of plot but there is plenty I have stated here to say how the film for me fell apart at the conclusion.
Overall very disappointed in conclusion of movie though I did enjoy it overall mostly. But could have been so much better in my opinion."
" Really good movie
",0.4927,0.8999,2019-11-21 00:00:00,8,"I really like this movie, it was different and genuinely creepy. The acting was great and the twist was unusual. It was nice seeing something fresh."
" Good, although flawed climax
",0.4404,0.26,2019-11-01 00:00:00,7,"This movie is very good for the first hour and 15 minutes and then some unfortunate writing and directing mistakes cap it off with a flawed climax. Nonetheless, there are some genuinely creepy moments and some scary in your face moments, and some misdirection which takes good advantage of genre conventions. For me, a rating of 7 means a movie has some moderate to serious flaws but is nonetheless still worth watching more than once."
" Average. Nothing new.
",0.0,0.3299,2019-08-06 00:00:00,5,"Jessabelle is a movie that has a lot of potential. It has a good and interesting story, the movie has a really well done progression that makes you want to watch it. But sometimes I think that lacks of realistic performances, because when the actress is doing something that would put her sad, she smile, which create some really awkward moments. It's a cool movie to watch but at the end is a one horror movie more. Did not has nothing special."
" Scarry and terrifying...!!!
",0.0,0.4118,2019-07-30 00:00:00,8,"Overall a great movie. This was a real horror movie because horror movies are supposed to scare you and it did that perfectly. Terrifying jumpscares and creepy scenes. However, it contains one or two things that don't make any sense. But it fulfills the requirements of it's genre. I would recommend it..."
" Gee, guess what happens?
",0.0,-0.8873,2019-07-23 00:00:00,4,"The movie was decent, for the most part. The continued popping up of VHS tapes got old really quick. Them using a whole freaking tape for not even five minutes was stupider. I mean, at least have it add on to the original. Where there was snow before, now there's filmed footage. More spooky then grossly underused tapes. Again, it was good until you get to the bloody ending. No, there's no blood. Where to start? Them showing her controlling the wheelchair, uh, not scary. Okay, I get, it's in her head. If it was, she wouldn't have been taken over in the water. But they showed it, which meant the binding should have been there. Then, like with every other stand alone horror movie, evil won. Yip yip yaiah. Same thing as every other movie now. Slashers don't count as they usually get a sequel. Disappointed in what could have been a better movie."
" Great Thriller
",0.6705,-0.5994,2019-07-22 00:00:00,7,This one is worth a watch. It's got all the necessary twists and bumps to raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Poor Jessabelle...nothing was her fault.
" Not my cup of tea horror wise, but definitely enjoyable
",0.7964,0.9341,2019-07-08 00:00:00,6,"Jessie (Sarah Snook) early Into the film gets hit by a car and spends the rest of the majority of the movie in a wheelchair. She is beautiful in this and Succession on HBO! This has fair bit of awesome bits like a very gross bath scene and when Preston (Mark Webber) gets attacked. I'm blown away this didn't receive a hard R-rating at least for terrifying subject matter! This is nothing special, although has a great story and a few cool shots. Also Mark Webber is one of my favorite actors because of movies like Snow Day, 13 Sins, Green Room, Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World, Antibirth, Boiler Room, and Don't Worry He Won't Get Far on Foot. Jessabelle is solid 6.5 from me."
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,0.0,2019-07-06 00:00:00,4,"I thought this would have some Louisiana atmosphere as did ""Skeleton Key"". I didn't experience much of that.
Very simple, spelled out theme.
And imagine if you will, a universe where physical therapy doesn't exist.
Could not wait for it to be over."
" Huge horror fan and this delivered the scares
",-0.3612,0.9569,2019-06-07 00:00:00,9,"This film was horribly panned by critics and viewers alike, so much so that it only appeared on my radar as a new addition to Netflix's catalogue recently. Reading the synopsis, I decided to give it a go for a few minutes and was engrossed all the way through.Firstly, Sarah Snook is amazing as the lead protagonist.
The idea of her being unable to walk was an excellent subconscious sell to me personally that made every cliche encounter all the more intense. I also loved the idea of her mother reading tarot cards in the past for her present self and the slow pacing by which said tapes are revealed to both the character as well as the viewers. The twist at the end was excellent, don't expect Shutter Island and I guarantee you will be entertained."
" voodoo in hollywood
",0.0,0.8952,2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you how important race relations are in the deep south. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" GET OUT OF THE HOUSE
",0.0,-0.8807,2018-11-10 00:00:00,8,"Jessabelle (Sarah Snook) was involved in a crippling car accident that killed her boyfriend. She reluctantly must return to her rural Louisiana home with her rough exterior father (David Andrews). She discovers old VHS tapes made for her by her deceased mother reading tarot cards. Her dad forbids her from looking at them and destroys them. She also reunites with her high school friend Preston (Mark Webber) contrary to the wishes of Mrs. Preston. Jessabelle sees and feels a presence in the house, a ghost that she believes is herself and wants her out.The confusions maximizes about 55 minutes into the ghost mystery and then answers come slowly.The film was well done. Sarah Snook made me think of Emma Stone (The Help) in this role. I actually felt a chill and had goose bumps near the end of the film, something that is rare for me.No swearing, sex, or nudity. If you liked this film you might also like ""Find Me."""
" Saw that twist coming.. Zzz..
",0.0,-0.7643,2018-09-29 00:00:00,4,"Couple scares. Plot was confusing and simple at the same time. Nothing new here. Check it out, but don't expect anything great."
" basic horror flick containing all elements for the genre.
",-0.5719,-0.598,2018-08-31 00:00:00,7,"This movie was good for a thriller/horror, but not great. (I'm not saying it is terrible or not worth taking time to watch) this is simply for the fact that it's the kind of movie where the viewer (especially being a horror movie nut like myself) is able to predict what will happen before it happens, but I enjoyed it enough to watch more than once if I've caught it on a movie channel. I suggest you take the time to watch this movie because whether it's ""slow"" like the other reviews are saying, it all comes together in time. I don't think it's slow, but it's suspenseful, which i enjoy is a key factor in horror / thriller movies."
" This is very similar to one Turkish horror movie
",-0.5719,0.4767,2018-08-30 00:00:00,6,"There was a Turkish movie called ""Dabbe 4: Cin carpmasi"" which was released a year before this one. Either the writers are friends or SOMEONE (this) is ""inspired"" from the other one"
" Underrated!
",0.0,0.757,2018-08-02 00:00:00,7,"Why such a low rating on IMDB?? It it definitely one of the best horror movies I have seen in recent years. It has great atmosphere and an original plot with a good portion of mystery and detective elements. Sarah Snook is really amazingly good in her part. And the film is scary, it reaches its goal perfectly! The atmosphere of the house she is forced to live in is really uneasy and eerie. You really feel walking in Jessies shoes as the story develops. By the way, I dislike horror films with an evident plot. I like horror films with a secret at the core of their plot which is (at least partially) resolved in the end. There are so many users here claiming that the plot reminds of a certain other movie and is predictable and has been done before. To me, it was a very original story, and I did not guess the secret until the end. And I have seen the other film the users are referring to and found it completely different from Jessabelle. If a movie is set in similar surroundings, it does not mean that the story is the same!
Give it a chance, it is worth it and way better than your usual horror flicks."
" Mediocrity Lurks in the Bayou
",-0.296,-0.9921,2018-02-06 00:00:00,5,"A woman torments her wheelchair-bound daughter from beyond the grave with VHS tapes in this voodoo-themed supernatural thriller. Written by Robert Ben Garant and directed by Kevin Greutert, Jessabelle (2014) keeps you guessing until the end, but an engaging mystery and attractive lead isn't enough to save this mediocre horror film from Blumhouse Productions.Tragedy strikes pregnant Jessabelle ""Jessie"" Laurent (Sarah Snook) when her fiancé Mark is killed in a car accident, which also causes her to miscarry and become paralyzed from the waist down. Now wheelchair-bound, she returns home to Louisiana to live with her father, Leon (David Andrews). For some reason Leon has kept her mother, Kate's (Joelle Carter) old bedroom sealed and reopens it for Jessie. Neither Jessie nor their housekeeper seem to think this is odd.Jessie, who believes her mother died of a brain tumor, discovers tapes her mother recorded as a message for her eighteenth birthday. This instigates several disturbing encounters with a dark-haired phantom (Amber Stevens West). Leon tries to destroy the tapes but ends up burning to death. At his funeral, Jessie reunites with her childhood sweetheart, Preston Sanders (Mark Webber).Together, Jessie and Preston investigate the strange events and their connection to a local voodoo church. They discover a baby's skeleton buried in the bayou with the same name and birth date as Jessie. The local sheriff (Chris Ellis) discovers the child's origin too late to save Jessie, who is attacked by the ghost of Kate and a voodoo priest named Moses (Vaughn Wilson). I won't spoil the ending, but it's a crazy plot twist that might have been interesting if it was developed a bit more.Sarah Snook is an Australian actress mostly known for appearing nude in the infamous film Sleeping Beauty (2011). She graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Arts and performs admirably in Jessabelle, albeit with a sloppy Southern drawl. She spends most of the movie wearing low-cut dresses aimed at cornering the teenage boys who have never used the Internet to watch porn demographic. I'll give her character credit for not taking whatever inheritance her dad left and getting on the first bus out of town after watching him inexplicably burn to death in a shed.There aren't many films set in the Louisiana bayou and even less featuring voodoo. That's what originally drew me to this film, and I wish it would have more fully explored the subject. Jessie never attempts to understand her mother's dalliance with the dark arts until the last moment. It would have been more interesting if she tried to learn something about voodoo and combat whatever dark spirit was tormenting her. But Jessabelle's fast pace doesn't give the characters, or the audience, much time for reflection.The film grabs you and races toward its conclusion, not giving you time to stop and ask questions like: why wouldn't Jessie's dad get rid of his wife's clothes and personal belongings after 18 years? Why would Jessie's dad make her stay in Kate's old bedroom, where she could discover the video tapes, instead of her childhood room? Why does the ghost of an infant look like a grown woman? Why did Kate have a wheelchair, when she committed suicide and wasn't actually sick? Why does Jessie take a bath fully clothed?Okay, the PG-13 rating answers that question.Critics and audiences panned Jessabelle (25% and 31% on Rotten Tomatoes), but I didn't think it was nearly as bad as more recent horror films like The Hatred (2017) and Annabelle: Creation (2017). It has creepy atmosphere, a mystery that keeps you guessing, and a strong lead, but it just doesn't take any risks. Jessabelle would have been much better off with an R-rating and a director who wasn't afraid to get creative or push the envelope."
" It does not come as a scare, but it's a good story.
",0.6872,0.2334,2017-08-25 00:00:00,6,"This film tells the story of Jessabelle, or Jessie, a girl who went to live with an aunt as a child after her mother's death. When she breaks both legs in a car accident, she's forced to return to her father's house, which is a stranger to her. In her old paternal home, she will rediscover the memories of her late mother, as well as a spirit of her past that will disturb her. The script is, thus, explained in few words and does not seem to bring additions to the traditional ghost story: a girl who is forced to discover an obscure part of her past by the supernatural intervention of a ghost. However, despite this lack of originality, the script works well and the story is well done. It takes place in rural Louisiana and makes good advantage of traditional black cultures and beliefs, such as vodoo and African witchcraft. Perhaps this use of vodoo is, in fact, the only remarkably uncommon note in this film. The end is based on a very nice and surprising twist plot, cutting the predictability that is felt throughout history.Sarah Snook did a good job in the lead role, and the supporting cast does a competent job as well. What I would most emphasize, however, is the good performance of the director, who has shown himself capable of horror without recourse to liters of false blood and limb amputations, as he was accustomed to doing in the ""Saw"" franchise. Cinematography is good but not brilliant. The scares are good, but don't properly frighten those who are inveterate fans of horror movies. It's enough, however, to cause some discomfort and tension, which is also pleasant."
