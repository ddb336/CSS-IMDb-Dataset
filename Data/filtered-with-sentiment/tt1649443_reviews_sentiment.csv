" Not as good as the first but fairly entertaining!
",0.5329,0.9779,2021-01-25 00:00:00,6,"So it's not the best of the rec films , but the setting and storyline really make this movie.
There's a lot going on and you'll definitely have had to watch the previous films to understand it, but hey this film if you watch it on a whim is pretty fun
The setting of the boat is claustrophobic but not quite as good of a setting as the original but it's very interesting as to what can happen.
The acting was pretty darn good and so was the cinematography.
The zombie makeup was better than the previous films I thought and I enjoyed seeing Angela return to be the zombie slayer that's he is!"
" Good sequel sets this franchise back on tracks after the third movie blunders
",0.4404,0.9744,2020-11-16 00:00:00,9,"I really missed this one out back in 2014! I guess after ""[Rec]³: Génesis (2012)"", I thought the series was doomed and probably never paid any attention to it. The third installment suffered from the old ""third movie fever"": first movie was great, [Rec]² (2009) was good, but the third movie was just ""meh"". Having the third movie weakly linked to the first movie was, maybe, the best part about it.It's not the case here at all! ""REC 4: Apocalipsis"" is, indeed, a sequel to all the previous movies and links them all together in a good way. (It's loosely linked to the previous movie, but I guess even the producers knew it was better not to mention that one that much...)After the events of the [Rec]² (2009), special forces enter the building to blow it up, but things go south after infecteds try to kill them. In the midst of all mayhem, Guzmán finds Ángela alive. When they wake up, some time after, they find themselves in a ship turned secret lab, where military and doctors are not very friendly towards them. There's no apocalypse taking place, so the title is kinda misleading.The plot is good and up to the point. It keeps itself serious and attempts a good pace at storytelling. Even with some minor setbacks, overall, I think the plot was good and well-presented.I love the acting on most Spanish movies. They are usually top-notch and ""REC 4"" is no different.The setting is filled with tension and feelings of clausthrophobia and fear. Nowhere feels safe. Most places are not safe all. There is a lot of gore, as expected, and it was effective. Some cheap CGI here and there, but, overall, the graphical effects are pleasant to see.All in all, a good ride and a nice installment for the REC franchise. I would definitely recommend it to zombie and horror movies fans."
" This movie.. It's not good.
",-0.3412,-0.1818,2020-09-01 00:00:00,3,"I wasn't against the idea of a non-found footage REC movie, so I didn't come into this film without much in the way of preconceptions or prejudice. The movie is well-shot, the FX are great, the acting is also pretty good. And that's where the good ends.The idea was there, but it wasn't at all developed. The screenplay is stale, the dialog is boring, even when good actors are saying it. There is a plot, but there's no attempt at investing the viewers into it. The characters are also boring, have no arcs, and you can't even call them cliché'd or stereotyped, as there practically isn't any characterization behind them. They make weird choices without any semblance of motivation, and end up being just cannon fodder to the zombies. Speaking of which..The zombies aren't scary. They aren't creepy, they aren't menacing, they're just.. There. This is basically what all the points in the previous paragraph culminate into - if you're not invested in the characters/plot, you won't be invested in the threat, no matter how well done the latter is. What made REC and REC 2 zombies scary is nowhere to be found in this movie. Just skip it."
" Decent ""ending"" of the series...
",0.0,0.2165,2020-08-24 00:00:00,6,"Considering the usual cheap ending, I wouldn't be surprised if the fifth part happens, but to the fans of series this will be very satisfying conclusion for the time being. First thing I have to say, there is no found footage point of view, which is movie's first flaw. Second flaw is a lot of really bad camerawork which is really noticeable during the fight scenes. Third flaw is lack of any kind of creepy and horror atmosphere. Pair it with the ending and fourth part of the series is by quality very close to the third part. It is, however, saved by the return of Manuela Velasco which get's rid of the parasite and is again the main character and cute as ever. All in all, to the fans of the series movie will be a nice piece of fun, but the rest (if there is any, considering this is the fourth part of the series) should avoid it. Just don't expect to be scared or to experience the great atmosphere of the first two parts. There's none of that here. 6.5/10!"
" A nice ending to the series
",0.4215,0.9854,2020-05-28 00:00:00,6,"Rec 4 is the last film of the Rec franchise and stars Manuela Velasco, Paco Manzanedo and Ismael Fritschi. I liked this movie and I think it's a good last part to the series. The acting is OK but I don't think anyone realy stands out much besides maybe the scientis villain played by Héctor Colomé, I like the setting and I think the story is interesting enough and sometimes it's pretty suspenseful even though it's not very scary. My big problem with the film is the fact that it doesn't look very good visually wich I think it's needless since this is no longer found footage, there are also some moments that have so many cuts and weak lighting that I can't tell what's going on.
Overall it's a good final chapter to a series I love and it's also very entertaining in fact despite the fact that it is not as good as Rec 2 I would actually say it's more entertaining then it.
6.3/10"
" Misses the engagement of the first one
",0.2732,-0.9155,2020-05-20 00:00:00,1,"The last installment of the series is not a nice goodbye. In times it relies on what came before and other times, it presents things that have nothing to do with what came before.The main issue of the REC series is the problem with deciding where the horror comes from. The story overall can't find what causes the transformation and therefore gives different explanations in each movie. This one ditches the found footage style which has its own promises but fails to deliver them. The horror is the least present and often times, the structure becomes predictable.Unfortunately, this final movie of the franchise is forgettable and doesn't offer much to its viewer."
" Where the Devil Resides
",-0.6597,-0.9896,2020-05-03 00:00:00,10,"The relocation of the Devil (the parasite) was particulary interesting in this final installment of the franchise.
First, the Devil relocates himself in Angela= an angel, which is reminiscent of the fall of Lucifer. Of course, an angel is the messenger of God. In the secularized modern world, an angel becomes a reporter as a part of the mass media. Angela is an earthly messenger of the world as opposed to the angels as heavenly messengers. She pursues accidents and tragedies in the chthonic society, and, as a result, she contracts a virus of pure Evil.
Then, the Devil resides in a soldier, i.e., the agressive nature of man, which perhaps can be associated with the Crusades or the imperialism. Secularized man resorts to the power built on the hypocritical cause. The Devil slides into this gilded nobleness of man.
Finally, the Devil, who is chucked out from the vessel (the conscious) into the ocean (the collective unconscious), enwombs himself in a fish, or the ichthus (a symbol of Christ).
In the age of science, all the supernatural elements including the Devil are chucked out from the secularized society of the 21st century. He no longer can live in the conscious of our mind. Where the Devil can reside is only in the Christ himself.
The ""Rec""series are very entertaining piece of an analysis on the religion and the evil in the postmodern world. I enjoyed them very much."
" Cliché end.
",0.0,0.8157,2019-11-26 00:00:00,5,"It's a good go-ahead but a bad one. The film is about Angela's story after she escaped the building. The surprises inside the film obviously liked it. Especially the images shown from the 1st and 2nd movies were beautiful. It's really ridiculous in some parts of his fiction. The end result is the same as many virus-related films. Apart from the first one, I would say that three other films were definitely shot for money.
The reason is that I think the concept of other films is more action oriented. If you do not watch movies other than the first REC.⭐ 100/50"
" Rec 4 Apocalypse returns to familiar shores but bloodily sinks mid-route.
",0.0,0.7447,2019-10-04 00:00:00,3,"Balaguero returns to direct, Velasco is back to finish business and no more wedding shenanigans. This was poised to be a claustrophobic restoration of a series that commenced with one heck of a statement. The original 'Rec' is one of the finest horror exports ever conceived. Its sequels on the other hand, not so much. Alas, after the continuity shattering third instalment, this final entry (apparently...) was the one to infect us all ferociously. Yeah, it's not. In fact, it's easily the weakest chapter yet, and another clear reason why this franchise should be shot in the head and severed by an outboard motor. After the apartment was quarantined, news reporter Angela is rescued and escorted to a remote facility in the middle of an ocean, only to find that an infected test subject has escaped and is chomping on all the passengers.Ensue carnage as the small crew of survivors literally scream, stare and flee from the oncoming disease. Now, as much as I scorned the religious flair of the ""infection's"" origins, it did hold some originality and thematic grip. Seems as though Balaguero, aside from presenting some archival footage of an exceedingly greater entry, forgot about the possession mumbo-jumbo and wait straight for a parasitical presence instead, essentially tarnishing the purpose of the previous entries. Honestly, I don't know how many times I have to say this, but continuity is the most crucial element to any franchise. Period! Never mind the CGI monkeys, self-destruct sequence and infected growls that resemble stock sound effects of a grizzly bear. It's deemed pointless if the film fails to continue with its over-arcing premise. What made 'Rec' the unique ""zombie"" horror that it was, has now dissipated by becoming as generic as any other entry in the sub-genre.It's not just the plot though. The found footage style has been swapped out for a basic inexpensive aesthetic that unveils more budgetary weaknesses than anything else. Why? It's called 'Rec' for a reason! The characters were stupid. The acting was mediocre. The frenetic editing meant audiences couldn't see anything. The dim lighting didn't assist in that department either. Oh, and the horror was non-existent. Gone are the days of claustrophobic apartment hallways where every turn could result in a nasty bite.It's not all terrible. I will say that the character of Nic was incredibly likeable and really was the true hero of this story. Anyone who can pretend to hack into security cameras with just a few keyboard presses deserves to have their time in the spotlight. And the prosthetic gore, which easily could've been visualised, showcased excellent makeup work so I appreciate the authenticity.Still, it deviates so far left from the original premise that it's essentially its own film entirely. The new direction doesn't work for me, and prepare yourselves for a fifth entry that involves a fish. Watch this space. It's going to happen. Now, ""vamos!"""
" Where's the Rec?
",0.0,-0.9049,2019-08-17 00:00:00,5,"""Rec""'s final chapter is really disappointing. The first two films of the saga were interesting especially for the fact that mockumentary was the technique and the narrative strength of the story; in Rec 3 we see that this particular expedient is progressively abandoned, and all of the effectiveness of the film is lost. Rec 3 is the worst among the four movies, and the fourth chapter manages to create an horror movie better built and without too much meaningless splatter. But the result is still disappointing: bad acting; unfocused moral positions of the characters; too easy final. And, mainly, the total loss of the mockumentary, that was all that made the series, at first, interesting."
" Awful
",-0.4588,-0.802,2019-07-08 00:00:00,2,The worst of the series... by far. Terrible acting and lots of yelling.
" I liked it
",0.4215,0.7717,2019-07-02 00:00:00,7,"I marathoned all the REC movies and both Quarantine Movies, and this was the last one I watched. After being pleased with Quarantine 1 and 2, and liking REC 1 and 2, REC 3 disappointed me. This did not. This got some jumps out of me, and made me want the final 2 to escape. If you were disappointed with REC 3, this will bring you joy. I recommend this movie."
" generic ending
",0.0,-0.0541,2019-04-04 00:00:00,5,"It does not come close to the success of the first and second films (I prefer to forget the third), does not appear to be from the same film franchise, but I thought it was going to be worse by the critics, it was a generic ending. A pity, as it had a series of ideas that could be raised and left open but nothing was taken advantage of. Worth a note 5. It is worth remembering that if this film franchise had started in Hollywood and by the hands of a James wan, it would explode of success, generating many spin-offs."
" 7.5. An excellent finale, don't expect too much, and you will be surprised!
",0.7088,0.25,2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,"Rec 4 somewhat links with the 3rd film, as one or two characters from the wedding are on a ship at sea with television reporter Angela, and a crew of scientists attempting to find a cure for the disease. It was the best of the franchise to me as the setting was far more isolated then the other films: increasing the tension and the disaster which could unfold if the virus broke out on board the ship (which of course it did). However, the film provided plenty of adventure and action with less horror (jumpscares) then the other films, which was a pleasant break from zombies jumping out of Shadows all the time. The adventure to the film inclined when the scientists started looking through Angela's camera footage from the first film in order to discover more of the virus: how it lives on through a host by inserting a (worm?) creature inside him/her. Great film, it's way underrated at 5.4."
" Not great, but a competent way to end the series.
",-0.5559,-0.9776,2018-11-30 00:00:00,7,"After seeing REC 3, I was very discouraged at the way the filmmakers had taken the series. With this film, they go back to the story and tone of the first two films. The biggest difference this time is the setting. The location this time is a ship at sea. Another change is that again the filmmakers decided to abandon the POV shooting style that they used in the first two films. The POV style was not used in REC 3 but they also changed the tone of the film into horror comedy. This time, they go back to straight horror.The film begins with the Army taking over the operation dealing with the apartment building. A special forces team is sent to destroy the building and while they are setting bombs they are attacked. They also hear a woman screaming and rescue her. It turns out that it is Angela, the reporter from the first film. The story then moves to the ship.Then Angela wakes up and is being tested by a doctor. We also find out that there is an elderly lady that was the only survivor of the events that occurred in REC 3. Angela is taken to the bridge and meets Nic, a tech guy who is trying to recover video from Angela's camera. He recovers the footage and sends it to the lab investigators on the ship. The lab is trying to develop an antidote for the virus. Suddenly, there is a blackout and an infected test monkey is released and attacks the ship's cook. Then the film really gets going. The attacks come fast and furious. Because REC 4 is shot in a traditional way the action is more elaborate and gory. The crew members begin getting infected a real havoc around the ship. One of the doctors named Ricarte finally sees the footage that was on Angela's camera and it reveals the moment that Tristana transfers the parasite we saw in the first film into Angela's mouth. Ricarte immediately tries to surgically extract the parasite from Angela but his assistant is attacked and she escapes. Angela insists that she is not carrying the parasite. Guzman confronts her about it and she accuses him of tricking all the people on the ship. It is revealed that Angela transferred the parasite to Guzman during her rescue. Ricarte is convinced that there is no other way to prevent the spread of the infection so he sets the timer to blow up the ship. Guzman corners Angela and the parasite attempts to enter her mouth but she kills Guzman before it can happen. Nic gets a lifeboat and Angela jumps into the ocean to flee with him. The ship blows up and they get away. The last shot is of the parasite in the water but I think the filmmakers make it clear that the story ends.This film ends the series on a pretty good note. I get that they couldn't repeat the POV style of the first two without seeming redundant, but this film works on it's own. It is well done but not as innovative and entertaining as the earlier films."
" A disappointing end to a brilliant series
",0.1531,-0.9254,2018-11-29 00:00:00,6,"The first 2 were brilliant and the 3rd was acceptable, but this was just extremely disappointing. Weak storyline, badly titled, confusing plot holes and just a complete let down"
" All Zombied Out!
",0.0,-0.0617,2018-10-24 00:00:00,5,"There's good news and bad news concerning Rec 4: Apocalypse.The good news is that thankfully, this is not a ""found footage"" film, so you won't need anti-nausea medication to watch it. The bad news is that there is an overabundance of hand-held camera footage, which combined with poor lighting and the inevitable lightening like editing, renders much of the climactic action impossible to follow coherently.This is a pity, as I liked the idea of most of the narrative of this sequel to the first 2 episodes, being confined to an ocean-bound ship, similar to Alien or Diehard.Unfortunate though, is the manner in which the story unfolds whereby the writers keenness to provide twists should have been moderated. We end up with a plot in which all the major characters, try to shaft one another at some stage and therefore aren't deserving of our sympathies. I just about cheered when the boat's self-destruct button was ultimately pushed, but was totally confused by one of the final scenes, which seemed to show hundreds of zombies still on board. From where did they come? Beats me. Unsurprising therefore, that I think it was sensible to call time on any future sequels."
" Works a treat
",0.4019,0.6131,2018-09-07 00:00:00,7,"APOCALYPSE is the fourth and final instalment of the long-running REC series of found-footage zombie flicks, following on from the unconnected third film. This one' takes a refreshingly visceral approach to the material, harking back to the intensity of the first film. It's not as good as that, not by any means, but it's a step up from parts two and three. The setting is a grubby and isolated ship, this time around, where a bunch of rather cold characters find themselves at the mercy of the exposed virus once more. I was delighted to see Manuela Velasco back as the put-upon Angela too, and very good she is too. Her performance is matched by others in the cast. This one's not a found footage film but it feels like one, with lots of fast camera motion and shaky action; I thought that, aside from some dodgy CGI effects, it worked a treat."
" Not the worst way for the franchise to end
",0.5096,0.9552,2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"After watching the third installment, it felt like the franchise is dead and they have completely ruined it. but surprisingly enough the creators understood their massive mistake and got back on course with the final chapter.Again, just like in part 3 everything looks more professional, more of a ''Hollywood'' style, if i may. They chose to move away from their ''homemade'' horror niche into the mainstream, which was not such a massive fail in comparison to part 3, which was utterly atrocious. The original main character, who started the series off is reintroduced, which is already a massive plus, since people have already grown to like her awesome performances in part 1. This time action takes place on a ship and takes more of an action movie kind of a route instead of its original shaky, thrilling and scary setting. They opt for more fights and bloody scenes, instead of jump scares and suspense, which was not horrible in this case, but it took a way the original feeling the first two parts gave us.Altogether, the final installment explained quite a lot, everything we have seen before came together, was a little out in the open and blatant, but still a massive improvement from part 3. It has been announced it is the final chapter, but the creators left it very easy for them to continue this series, if they wanted to, with a very open ending with a lot of future possibilities. So, perhaps we are going to see REC 5 after all?"
" A dire ending, and an insult to the classic first two films...
",-0.743,-0.941,2017-04-22 00:00:00,2,"Rec 1 and 2 are two of the greatest horror films ever made.Using found footage, they were able to add incredible immediacy, tension and rawness to a tired genre and established an identity all of their own.The second film also managed to raise the stakes by adding a really creepy Satanic dimension to proceedings. I was utterly gripped by the story and was looking forwards to 3 and 4 to see where the story would lead.It went only one place...straight down the toilet. Rec 3 and 4 are almost tragically bad. Selling out everything that made the first films such bona fide classics in favour of tired cliché. This particular film is just a poor man's Resident Evil. I don't suppose we'll ever really know what happened and why the creative team made such poor choices, but it's a real pity. They had the formula, they'd set the story up perfectly...but then they fixed everything that wasn't broken, and completely broke it.No series I've ever heard of has betrayed itself in this way before, and we can only hope it never happens again."
" Not a great way to end the series (if, indeed, this is the end).
",-0.5096,0.9902,2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"REC 4 opens as army doctor Guzmán (Paco Manzanedo) and soldier Lucas (Críspulo Cabezas) rescue TV reporter Ángela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) from the apartment block where the original movie took place. The trio are put on a quarantine ship where scientists conduct experiments into creating an antivirus. However, the true nature of the infection means that it isn't long before the survivors are running for their lives from drooling, crazed, flesh-hungry 'zombies'.Part 3 of the REC series had quite a lot of detractors, but I enjoyed it for its refreshing change in approach, which saw the introduction of a touch of humour and a lot more splatter. REC 4: Apocalypse is a return to the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of the first two films (but thankfully, with minimal found footage style camera-work); as such, it will be seen as a welcome case of 'back to basics' by many, but to me it felt very predictable, and, as a result, less satisfying. I also found the gore lacking and was surprised by how few scares there were.Oh well, at least director Jaume Balagueró had his heroine strip to a tight white vest and got her good and sweaty for the finalé (sometimes, it's the simple things in life).5.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 6 for IMDb."
