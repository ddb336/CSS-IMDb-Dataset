" Hopeless
",-0.4588,-0.9457,2021-03-20 00:00:00,1,"Nate Parker's directorial debut The Birth of a Nation emerged from the cloud of the ""#OscarSoWhite"" controversy, placing it in the earliest position of any 2016 film for Oscar contender status as it presented an assailed film industry it's quickest and easiest P.R. rehabilitation scheme. However, the racially-charged subject matter and ensuing controversy over actor/director/co-writer Nate Parker's 1999 rape allegations doomed whatever commercial or Academy Award prospects the film originally seemed to have. For some, it was a matter of pride to attack Nate Parker whose past activities and September apology tour were merely part of ""rape culture,"" a social cause relevant to modern college campuses.For others, it was a matter of pride to defend Parker whose media take-down was merely an attempt to silence a historical film about black rebellion. For others, the fact that Nate Parker's marriage and alleged rape involved a white woman brought into ""question"" his black credentials. The unproductive, circular debates on slavery, racism, rape, gender and history made it a much easier for critics and awards organizations (outside of the NAACP Image Awards, Black Reel Awards or African-American Film Critics Association) to write-off the film altogether rather than have to contend with debates, protests and boycotts possibly being waged at their doorstep.By late 2016, the awards season conveniently had other and better-reviewed contenders dealing with racial issues to choose from including Moonlight, Fences, Hidden Figures and Loving. Unfortunately, the controversies have completely overshadowed the film and little has been discussed about the film itself. The film tells the story of Nat Turner, a slave who led a violent rebellion in Southampton, Virginia in 1831. The film largely diverts from historical accuracy to create a Braveheart meets 12 Years a Slave drama that downplays the complexities and even harsher realities of the real-life events to engage in a less morally ambivalent story. In doing so, the film lacks any original, or even meaningful observation of the situation.Instead, the film uses a traditional storytelling frame in which all the events seem staged for an easily-identifiable affect whether it be planting the seeds of a later event or simply making certain characters unsympathetic rather than giving weight or purpose to their actions, beliefs or ideas. To his credit, Parker does demonstrate an ability toward directing as he produces good-enough performances, and fine aesthetics from cinematography to production design within a historical period drama. Still, his film lacks heft in the storytelling department. The pacing, while consistent and spacious, fails to give the characters enough depth or room to shine, especially Aja Naomi King who might have had an extremely compelling role in the film but instead fades into the background becoming merely nothing more than a symbol of victimization.Much of the film lingers on dehumanization followed by the slowly unraveling reactions in Nate Parker's performance as Turner, which seems designed to make the final events more perfunctory. Nevertheless, the scenes of gut-wrenching torture of slaves are never matched by events that are triumphant in reaction. Instead, the film comes off as an exercise in despairing for its own sake. It is never uplifting or inspiring, nor does it provide any solace or satisfactory answer to the dehumanization that had transpired throughout. Instead, it presents a harrowing, and sorrow-filled experience made complete with an unsatisfactory last salvo that arouses no excitement. It ends on a seemingly defeatist and hopeless note, worded in aftermath.By the rolling credits, it becomes apparent that The Birth of a Nation has literally nothing to offer its audience as it's story remains as depressing as it started. Its history is that of convenient Hollywood fantasy. Its frame provides no insight as it sinks under the weight of its own lack of originality. Its revenge quenches no blood-thirst. Its end lacks any hope or productive send-off. It's less apparent, considering its poor overall results, what all this hurrah, controversy and debate was for. Such disruption of social harmony demands a better film with at the very least, something to say worth thinking about afterward."

" Was Nat Turner even a real person?
",0.0,-0.9241,2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,"TBOAN was a good movie even for a race bait movie.Its about slavery and slaves fighting to be ""free"" in The United Dogs of America. (I would have used Snake but dogs are more vile creatures than snakes. ).This movie uses the bible as if its historical. The lead actor was excellent. The other actors were good too.
The story is simple. Its about racism.
It has violent parts and overall its a great movie despite it being a race bait movie.Upon marketing before release date there was a lot of stigma and backlash at the movie. That didn't bother me I still went and saw it. It didn't make want to get an axe.
It didn't end in a happy ending. 200 years later we're still slaves. Nothing has changed. like Nat Turner in 2020-2021 you have to accept slavery for ""SAFETY"". If you want freedom you are an evil, horrible, despicable person.Verdict: solid film if you love a race bait movie especially if you're a Cay Key 3ey."

" A great lesson in how not to pace a film.
",0.6249,-0.9113,2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,"This movie is two hours long. That's it, including credits. That said it feels long. The actual rebellion doesn't start until 1:25:00. Maybe that would be fine if the movie was longer, but honestly the lead up is very unnecessary.There's too many characters, number one. While Samuel Turners turn from ""decent"" slave master (if such a thing really exists) to desperation causing him to violate his normal boundaries is interesting but I don't care. I didn't need it to feel the impact of him rising up against his former childhood friend. What's more, I question the accuracy of much of it. I know he was a preacher, but that aspect is downplayed. Some of the rest borders on ridiculous such as his Aunt being dead after stitching him up, seemingly fine, the night before. Also the rape of his wife, while terrible, is treated like an afterthought. There may be a grander message here about what life was like for them, but it comes at the expense of time that should've been spent on the protagonists. Nate Turner comes off surprisingly thin for a movie about him. His rebellion feels like it should have more impact in a film specifically about that.I could've easily sat through an hours worth of the rebellion and spared somewhat obvious explanations for why he could read (he was taught), why he was a slave preacher (white slave owners asked him to be). It felt a bit like one of those superhero origin films where they feel the need to tell you where Batman's bat ears were shipped from. Sometimes the audience can just fill in gaps themselves.Moreover the cinematography is bland. The shot composition is weak. It feels more like a better than average made for TV movie, not one made for theaters.It's not a terrible film, but rather a disappointment. It's called Birth of a Nation in reference to The Birth of a Nation (1915), a film that is both terrifyingly racist and revolutionized filmmaking forever. This in no way does the latter, but at least it isn't the former."
" Incredible documentary

This movie highlights the heroic efforts of on man who defied the system of oppression and dirty past where Africans were treated as much as cattle... Men were treated as piece of property, owned, and demeaned. This movie is the very challenge that the US deals with today. We can not put people in a cage, beat, starve, and mistreat an entire race of people and then surprisingly wonder why these same people are living below the poverty line and have social issues and are in jail. This movie highlights the beginning of the stop of this mistreatment. If shows the mental fortitude and strength necessary to fight oppression. It's telling that this movie is still controversial in this day. It shows the sins of this nation. The only way to overcome an atrosity like this is two fold and exactly like any other misfortune. One, stop the abuse. Two,acknowledge and repent if the wrongdoing. This heals our shortcomings. This is also not new... Germans make sure they never forget what happened with their racial cleansing. They do this because the want their people to know they are over it, ashamed of it, and are now compassionate. U believe this movie starts the discussion."
" Failed to recreate history
",-0.5106,0.9625,2020-02-19 00:00:00,4,"The birth of a nation is a period drama movie directed by Nate Parker and stars Nate Parker, Armie Hammer, Colman Domingo, Aja Naomi King, Penelope Ann Miller, Jackie Earle Haley and Mark Boone Junior in the leads.The movie is based on a slave rebellion in 1831.The concept of the movie is good but fails miserably in execution. Although the movie touches a very sensitive history but still the movie fails to connect.The screenplay of the movie is very slow and at certain points it seems that the movie has came to a standstill.Direction is ok but the most impressive in the movie is acting by Nate Parker. He had done his job with utmost honesty and perfection but he had been laid down by himself with poor execution.Background music and location is good. Acting of support cast is good. Overall movie will disappoint you although it has few of beautiful scenes."

Before I watched the movie (quite the undertaking by the director and star of the movie, same person), I did not read anything about it, but after watching it, I wanted to see how much was based on actual facts and how much happened exactly like it was depicted. And because I googled it, I saw that the title of the movie had been used before ... by a movie made for the Klan or was used by the Klan to further their agenda.So I guess in a sense this tries to take that stigma away from it. But back to this movie here and it is a tough watch. So many things that are being done to human beings, that at the time were not treated as such. And even the better white people seem to have their issues to put it mildly. When things go south (no pun intended), but even before the depiction of violence is quite vivid. So nothing for the faint hearted or squeamish.You may see where this is going, but it won't change the effect it will have once it reaches that point ... riveting, draining and quite powerful!"

Not only do they use whiteface to lighten the skin color of the actor's faces, but they actually use it around their mouths, similar to a time in history where blackface over-characterized certain features they wanted everyone to see...black and white people. There was an entire era of hyper-mockery, and they are using it in this film. I am pretty disgusted by this fact. If you didn't notice the first time around...rewatch it.The story line was good as it portrays the black people uprising in the face of oppression; a part of history that needs recognized, but I sit wondering if I missed anything else oppressive in this film."
" I recently found this disc on the 25-cent close-out sale table . . .
",0.0,0.9675,2018-10-24 00:00:00,4,". . . of my local video store. How could something in such a fancy jewel case fail to merit space on even the sold-for-a-dollar shelf? I wondered. However, when I tried to solve this puzzle by actually viewing THE BIRTH OF A NATION, the answer became as clear as filtered water: This flick is on the Wrong Side of History! As Minority Spokesman ""Canny West"" lectures us about the need to reestablish Slavery in the USA at Leader Trump's Right Hand, this week's headlines highlight the fact that the latter luminary has taken the lead in this direction already. ""The Art of the Deal"" author is the first prominent American to figure out a way to clear a lucrative profit from the so-called ""Peculiar Institution"" in almost Two Centuries! He's chuckling all the way to his federal reserve bank (Branch T) while depositing pure net gains from Mauritania's per capita escaped-slave-recovery honorariums, because America's ICE Agency is allowing U.S. taxpayers to foot the entire bill of overhead costs in transporting scores of highly-coveted individuals BACK to their Homeland, famous across the world for being Today's biggest bastion of Slavery. Mr. West contends that one or two races are better off in the protective embrace of the Master Class. Just as Leader Trump already has pulled off the feat of mixing in some Johnny-come-lately trouble-making short-term U.S. ""citizens"" among the legions of deported undocumented masses, don't be surprised if some of the back-stabbers sharing Spokesman West's ROOTS find themselves among those with one-way tickets to Mauritania. Hopefully, if BIRTH OF A NATION defies the 25-cent table by spawning a sequel, its filmmakers will eat some crow and note that a Man of Peace--Mr. West--has come along with a Better Idea."
" ""To watch a strong man broken down is a terrible thing.""
",-0.4404,-0.9906,2018-08-21 00:00:00,8,"I was surprised to see Nate Parker's name attached to this film as writer, producer and director, along with his portrayal of the principal character. For a first time project from a fledgling director, this was quite the masterful accomplishment. I recall the Nat Turner Rebellion from high school history class but had long forgotten that it took place three decades before the start of the Civil War. Parker tells his story with all the frightening horror that accompanied the history of slavery, and traces Nat Turner's devotion as a man of God to his eventual transformation as a leader of a rebellion to condemn that brutality. As usual, there will be those who decry the picture for racist elements, but what should concern anyone is why a movie shouldn't be used as a viable means to teach others about the historical record. Granted, there will be errors both of commission and omission in the telling, but taken in a broader context, the film is successful in depicting the evils of slavery and how blacks and whites working together was required to eventually eliminate it via a war that ripped the soul of the nation. This picture is a not a reworking of the 1915 silent film classic of the same name, though I did find an interesting connection with that picture, in as much as respected stage and silent film actor Henry B. Walthall lent his name to the character of Reverend Walthall in this movie, effectively portrayed by Mark Boone Jr."
" Worth watching
",0.2263,0.9816,2018-08-21 00:00:00,6,"A powerful story inspired by true events. A winner of two Sundance awards. But the question is, is it entertaining? The film is well made and generally the acting is quite good. The film has atmosphere and is somewhat moving. However, the story is slow to get going and just sort of plods along to a very predictable ending. For production quality and direction we would give this movie an 8, for entertainment the most we would award is a 4. Will we watch it again, probably not."

Some movie do not ever get close to the hype Like The Godfather or the The Godfather part II. or The Silences of the lambs. Or The Godfather part III. This a good movie. It is kind of sad. But it did have a good story line. It also had good acting. If you like history dreams this is a good movie to see. PS. to the haters. Women and children are not always so innocent. I am white and have to say the slave owners got exactly what was coming to them. It is a shame there didn't kill more and get way with it.

I admire Nate Parkers effort to bring forth a piece from history that would show that black culture didn't just sit back and accept their circumstance but fought for freedom, but he chose the wrong direction. The movie was supposed to be about the actual rebellion, and it should have gone straight to the battle. It took tooo long to get there and when you get there , the battle lasted all of 5 minutes in a defeat that ended with a black man hanging from a tree and whites clapping in the background. ummmm no. people pleasing ending, psychological warfare and the emasculating of black men in film and theatre is getting really tired."
" Great music and locations, not much else
",0.6249,-0.9457,2018-02-12 00:00:00,3,"I frequently caught myself pulled in to the location settings and music, working together to create an immersive feeling. However, Nate Parker is not a talented actor, writer, nor director. All of his contributions lessened this movie. The overall quality and tone of this movie would be excellent for a middle school project, but lacks any real perspective on the events transpiring. The white slave owners come off as more of villains in a 70s blacksploitation movie, than the institutionalized evil they represent. The lack of substance is alluded to in the title itself: an attempt to link this work to something older and more infamous. It tries to assume a place in the debate by namedropping, rather than offering any ideas of its own."
" A long dull slog
",-0.4019,0.9405,2017-12-24 00:00:00,3,"Nat Turner (Nate Parker) is a literate slave and preacher and his owner Samuel Turner (Armie Hammer) decides to use Nat's skills to try to calm down other unruly slaves. However, when Nat continually witnesses the atrocious way that the slaves are treated he decides that he can stand by no more and with the help of a small group of fellow slaves he decides to overthrow their owners' violent regime...The Birth Of A Nation is a well-intentioned, but frequently dull film. Whilst there clearly is a story here, Parker doesn't seem in much of a hurry to tell his story - the film flits between atrocities and preaching, but without any glue to hold the two things together. There's no real character development on offer here and Parker doesn't really teach us much about the era either; I have learned to take biopics with a pinch of salt as we all know that they can often be 'historically inaccurate', but I still think it would have been nice if there were more in the way of content.Parker presents the whole thing in such a dull and one-dimensional manner that it's almost impossible to care about anyone or anything (and believe me it is hard for me to write these things knowing how badly slaves were treated in the 19th century), but those are my honest feelings on this film.There were a couple of things that I liked about the film; the score is good and the era has been captured very well. Parker does give an impassioned performance and although his film is problematic, his performance is nothing short of superb - although I found it distracting because of how much he reminded me of Jamie Foxx. He's well supported by the likes of Armie Hammer and it's always nice to see Jack Haley in any picture and he's great in the limited scenes that he appears in.All in all, The Birth Of A Nation is a pretty poor film that sadly doesn't have a particularly engaging narrative and is filled with poorly developed one-dimensional characters whom it is hard to really care about (as I said before it pains me to say this, but sadly it's true). This is Nate Parker's directorial debut and in fairness I can see potential here, but let's hope that he improves his craft on his next attempt."
" Well-intentioned but clumsy and, for the most part, unoriginal and dull
",-0.5499,-0.8581,2017-10-21 00:00:00,4,"Virginia, 1820s/30s. Nat Turner is a slave on a cotton plantation. Through his eyes we see the conditions the slaves have to live under, in particular, the brutality of the slave-owners. Due to having the rare privilege of being able to read, Nat is a Christian preacher. His ability to influence other slaves is used by the slave-owners to their own ends, and ultimately by Nat to fight back.Based on a true story, and produced by, directed by, written by and starring Nate Parker, this movie had the potential to be a powerful examination of the inhumanity of slavery. However, for the most part, it doesn't go anywhere new and is quite dull in its delivery. The first 70% or so of the movie would be only interesting to those who had never seen a movie or documentary on US slavery before. Pretty stock standard stuff, with one-dimensional characters and predictable plot. Quite clumsy at times too, with unnecessary symbolic imagery that is almost laughable. The final 30% sees the outcome of this brutality and is fairly interesting, with an ending that is reasonably powerful. However, it is underdeveloped and demonstrates how bad the pacing of the movie is. Instead of spending 70% on overdrawn setup and 30% on hasty conclusion, Parker should have built up the pace and spent more time on the outcome.On another note, the choice of title is interesting. The 1915 film The Birth of a Nation is one of the most controversial and divisive movies of all time. Directed by cinematic pioneer DW Griffith, on the one hand it is lauded as a seminal moment in movie history, due to its cinematographic innovations. However, it is also one of the most racist movies ever made, ending up as a pro-Ku Klux Klan propaganda campaign.If one of the aims of the 2016 The Birth of a Nation was to reclaim what the title means and set the record straight, fair enough. Just a pity the finished product doesn't come anywhere close to living up to that billing.Watch 12 Years a Slave instead."
" Really good film
",0.4927,0.9687,2017-10-08 00:00:00,9,I found this a really good film that entertained me throughout. I won't get all dramatic like some that lie to review however it was good and I don't need to say anymore. I usually love this kind of film so it was a no brainier for me. I have watched it once on my own and once with my family enjoying the experience both times. I would truly recommend this film.
" One of the Very Best American Slavery Pictures
",-0.1458,-0.9953,2017-09-30 00:00:00,10,"I'll qualify my review by saying that I was raised in the Deep South by my parents, who were prejudiced Caucasians, and that because of their influence there was always a part of me that felt we were better than people of darker skin tones. That part of me didn't completely die until I was already in my 30s, and I would go as far as to say that a large percentage of Southern ""white"" children, especially those born before the latter two decades of the 20th century (I was born in 1963), had prejudice to fight off, rethink, and come to terms with. I have heard horror stories from other Southern ""whites"" that I will not repeat here, but let it suffice to say that a hatred of Blacks is alive and well, if diminishing. I hope it's diminishing anyway. So, what about this film? 12 Years A Slave was riveting, but this one did it for me in a way that no other slavery film has to date--and I've seen most of them, and a few handfuls of Civil War films to boot. The take-away from films like this one is that there is really nothing to fear from the ""other."" Now I do realize that European Caucasian culture somehow developed the idea centuries ago--Elizabethan times if not long before (where Blacks were called Blackamoors)--that Caucasians are somehow more intelligent than people born on the African continent. They claim they get this information from the Bible, but I have actually studied that book from cover to cover for nearly 50 years, and nowhere in it does it say that those of the Hamitic line are less of anything than those of the Japhetic or Semitic lines. So Ham made a mistake 45,000 years ago and had sex with his own mother while they were all drunk? So what. The child's name was Canaan, and he was born perverted and cursed. Ham was never cursed. Yes, he was shunned by his two brothers, but there was no curse lain on him for his actions. And, even if there had been, is this to say that everyone allegedly of his bloodline would be cursed. What we are really talking about here is pseudo- intellectual bull malarkey drummed up by European ""whites"" so they could have somebody work for their lazy royal arses. After all, as we moved into the Colonial era, there were very few Caucasians left to tend the fields of the wealthy. You see, they had all been sent off to various wars and killed. What to do? Enslave Africans, of course. All that said, there is no support in all of the Bible for slavery after Saint Paul begins to dismantle the slavery system by introducing a societal leveler, being Christianity--where, ideally and the way it should work, you don't get to be rich and you never have to be poor. And you certainly never have to be a slave--except a willing slave to Jesus, which is quite a different thing altogether. When I am crucified in that particular system, it is my choice, not the choice of some inconsistent and often sadistic master. God help every soul who has died with hatred in their hearts for the Black man and woman. The Judgment is still yet to come."

Nate Parker gives us an excellent performance, although ""12 Years a Slave"" was a better film. The original film ""Birth of a Nation"" was the first film to be shown at the White House. It's Reconstruction message brought about protest and a resurgence of the KKK.

" Very Good Depiction Of The Leader Of The Most Famous Slave Revolt In American History
",0.4927,-0.9991,2017-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Aside from the Nat Turner rebellion, most slave revolts in America have been largely forgotten - in spite of the fact that the largest slave revolt in US history took place in Louisiana 20 years BEFORE the Turner rebellion. ""The Birth Of A Nation"" offers us director, writer and star Nate Parker's perspective on the Turner rebellion. The movie receives a lot of negative comments which are probably based primarily on Parker's own controversial past. (He was accused of sexual assault while this movie was in production.) It's also possible that there's a segment of whites who have difficulty confronting the subject matter. I found this an engrossing movie that built well to its climax and in the end was moving and inspirational. The movie isn't without it's flaws but it provides a sobering perspective on slavery in the American south.That in itself, mind you, might be the movie's biggest flaw. The sobering perspective it provides is just another sobering perspective. It doesn't really offer anything fresh about the treatment of slaves in the south, simply reminding us that slavery was a brutal institution that dehumanized an entire race of people. There are some historical issues with the movie. First is the scene depicting the brutal rape of Turner's wife Cherry - which seems to have been invented by Parker for the film and becomes what you might call ""the last straw"" leading Turner into rebellion. But there's no evidence that it ever happened. I also thought that Parker softened the blow of the rebellion itself, perhaps to make Turner seem more noble? It was a bloody revolt that deliberately targeted white women and children and not just the men who owned the plantations and the slaves - but we didn't see much of the slaughter of the women and children. Turner's capture toward the end of the movie held Turner up as a model rather than offering the truth. In the movie Turner seems to hold his head high as he gives himself up. The truth is that he hid in the woods for a couple of months until he was discovered hiding in a hole in the ground by a white farmer. Parker clearly had an agenda here - to turn Turner into more of a hero than he was. The film also doesn't offer much analysis of the impact of the revolt. Was it successful? It's hard to say how to measure the success of such a revolt. No slaves were freed by it, and in the immediate aftermath of the revolt literally hundreds of blacks - slave and free - were murdered, and many laws were enacted that oppressed blacks even more than they already were. Little of that gets mentioned at any length. So the movie has its issues. However, I personally thought that the movie overcame those problems. In the basic flow of the story, the history was accurate enough, although the movie chose to have Turner remain the property of Samuel Turner up until the rebellion, whereas he had actually bounced around a fair bit. Perhaps that decision was made so that Samuel would be a sort of composite character representing all slave owners - but it creates a historical problem when Nat kills Samuel at the beginning of the rebellion since Samuel had died several years before the revolt. Turner was a preacher - taught to read and familiar with the Bible - and he definitely believed himself to be called by God for a greater purpose. That is a recurring theme in the movie: that Turner believed himself to be God's instrument, and the ultimate revolt to be God's vengeance against the white oppressors. In that, it points out that religion can be used to promote violence and killing as well as love and peace. I suppose it also raises the question of whether such violence and killing is sometimes justified - which are actually very relevant questions in today's world, where religious-inspired violence is becoming commonplace. In the movie, Turner helps an indebted Samuel save his plantation by being rented out to other whites to preach submission to their slaves, carefully selecting only ""approved"" verses from the Bible to justify slavery but is shown to become increasingly uncomfortable as he becomes more aware of Bible verses that condemn slavery and seem to justify violent rebellion against oppression.The movie depicts a lot of violence. There's rape, there's beatings, Turner himself is mercilessly whipped when he's believed to have become too ""uppitty"" in his preaching, for lack of a better word. The actual rebellion – while softened in its brutality - is still shown to be a violent and bloody one. Parker's performance as Nat Turner was extremely good. He's been criticized by some for (as the director and writer) placing too much of the focus on his own character, but that strikes me as a ridiculous criticism. The revolt is probably the most famous slave revolt in American history and it's remembered as the Nat Turner Revolt. How you could tell the story of the Nat Turner Revolt without focusing heavily on Nat Turner is beyond me. I also liked Aja Naomi King's performance as Cherry. The title is intriguing. ""The Birth Of A Nation"" seems to deliberately reference D.W. Griffith's 1915 ""Birth Of A Nation"" - which presented a very different story, steeped in racism and a defence of the Ku Klax Klan, which was just beginning to reorganize as that early movie was released. I'm not sure the point that was being made in taking the name - but it's obvious that there was a point.I think this movie does overcome its weaknesses and offers us a glimpse of some of the issues that confronted the past and that, in some ways, are still confronting the present.

" Powerful and thought-provoking
",0.4215,0.9777,2017-08-21 00:00:00,8,"A polarizing film that I don't think has gotten a fair shake. I liked it and thought it was a powerful film, even if it was a little romanticized and formulaic in some places. To start with, Nate Parker turns in a great performance as Nat Turner, and Aja Naomi King does as well as his wife. The rest of the ensemble cast is strong. The cinematography is beautiful, and Parker captures several beautiful, haunting images, the most indelible one for me coming when Turner notices a white girl skipping across a porch with a black girl skipping behind, playing, and yet on a leash. It's violent, but it also has quite a bit of tenderness, and is effective in showing that the enslaved were thinking, feeling people, just like you and me, and it also honors their culture. Lastly, it's accurate in showing the context for the rebellion (and certainly as accurate as many lauded historical films), and I think its power lies first and foremost in showing us the events unapologetically from an African-American's perspective. Parker uses a bit too much of a heavy hand at times, not uncommon for a first-time director, but this is a film that should be seen, and with an open mind.I think we've become so inured to scenes of brutality that they don't register with us anymore. We see slave owners brutalizing their ""property"" – human beings – and our reaction starts becoming either (a) oh yes, I've seen all that before, I know, I know, and by the way so-and-so shot it better, or (b) surely he's over-the-top in this scene, shamelessly exaggerating and distorting history. I think we have to acknowledge that these things happened. They happened. Lynchings. Ripping families apart. Rape. Extreme cruelty. Humiliation. Even the most liberal view at the time still believing in the black man's inherent inferiority. And on and on. This was the context of the rebellion. It's almost entirely accurate, or a reasonable portrayal where history is not known, and I forgive it for the places it may not be as artistic license - most notably Turner's own wife being raped, which was scrutinized so much that I think people missed the larger point.We're taught about the glory and honor of the Confederacy in most history classes, and oh yes, by the way, Nat Turner led a bloody rebellion three decades before the Civil War. You're going to tell me that the myth of the noble Southern gentlemen, the slaveowner who took loving care of his ignorant slaves for their own good, is more accurate than what this film shows? You're going to have the one-star reviewers with comments that literally begin with lines like ""Not saying slavery was right, but"" and then say racism no longer exists in America? Nat Turner was a man who was highly intelligent, learned to read and write despite having limited educational opportunity, correctly likened slavery of blacks in the south to the slavery of the Israelites in Egypt, and (very) courageously attempted to rebel against extreme injustice. The film gets all these things right. Why do we not see him as a hero in our nation's history? Killing women and children is horrible, but put it in context, and ask, what was happening to Turner and his people before they did that? For centuries. To millions.The name of the film of course disrupts D.W. Griffith and his glorification of white supremacists, but it also makes us pause and think that for a portion of the citizens of our country, July 4, 1776 was not the birth of their nation. They were still in chains, and had not been able to declare independence. It's interesting to think of Turner's rebellion as that seminal moment, as the birth of a new nation, and I would not have thought of any of these things or known as much about him without this film. If it goes too far in depicting him as a 'nice guy', not showing all of those he killed in his uprising or not showing the odder side of his religious visions, well, maybe we should be thinking that a romanticized view is both a reaction to both our current culture, as well as a perspective someone else has that we haven't considered before. Making us think. You know, as artists do."
" Should never have been talked about as an awards contender
",0.5423,0.9942,2017-08-13 00:00:00,5,"It's quite strange to fathom at the time of writing, that many months on from the initial hype of The Birth of a Nation's Sundance appearance, where now controversial actor/director Nate Parker found his film to be an early year Oscar contender, that this film was ever talked about seriously as a film worthy of taking home golden statues and becoming a box office hit and after a lacking awards season and a box office run that barely saw the film make back its marketing costs, it seems as though The Birth of a Nation noise was just that and nothing more.It's hard to pinpoint just how much of an effect Parker's past misdemeanours or cloudy background had on Birth of a Nation's ability to transform the Sundance hype (where it was sold for a record amount of money to its distributor Fox Searchlight) into anything substantial and its likely it did play a large part in hampering its potential as a film audiences flocked to but at the end of the day it's also likely that those initial vocal supporters of the film realised that this Parker passion project in which he directs, writes, stars in and produces just isn't that accomplished of a film.The true story at the heart of Nation, that of slave preacher turned rebellion leader Nathanial Turner is a worthily famous one and while Parker and his co-writer Jean McGianni Celestin have taken certain liberties with the story for cinematic purposes, Nation just never gets us totally committed to the goings on in the narrative from Turner's romance with fellow slave Cherry, his commitment to God and the Bible or his eventual rebellion, they all feel like components of the film we should feel more for and while there's horrific scenes playing out before us (Parker should be commended for showing the true atrocities of the time and not shying away from them) that certainly aren't for the faint of heart, Nation's inability to connect us emotionally is a failing that can't be overcome.Much of this blame must be placed at the feet of Parker who has taken years to get this story to the big screen, his direction lacks polish with some uneasy surreal dream sequences and visions in particular shoddily done, his acting a little too forced and script work lacking in polish and had he perhaps handed over more control to another it may've allowed him time to nail the core of this story that feels half-baked, a college film masquerading as a Hollywood quality drama.Final Say – An important story to be told, a film with some strong individual moments and one that in the face of recent Hollywood controversies surrounding lack of diversity and colour representation a timely story too boot, Birth of Nation should never have been spoken about in the same sentence as Academy Awards and while this long gestating Parker project showcases certain abilities for the budding filmmaker/actor, there's still a long road for him to take before he makes a truly awards worthy film and a road likely that not remains blocked for him forever due to a past that will shadow him in Hollywood for the remains of his career.2 ½ uncomfortable sermons out of 5"

Instead it's dull, slow, and predictable. White people make promises, and don't keep them. Young Nat Turner learns to read, and soon discovers he is different from other slaves. The Bible seems to comfort him at first, but then it makes him mad. The slaves join him and fight bravely, but everyone dies at the end. Nothing is a surprise from start to finish, except how much screen time is taken up by panoramic picture postcard views of cotton fields and trees festooned with Spanish Moss.Nate Parker has made a very boring movie about a very complicated and charismatic man. It's sad that the only powerful action sequence in the entire film comes when Nat Turner's father beats down a slave patrol and escapes into the night, never to be seen again. That scene takes about two minutes of screen time, and then it's gone. Nothing Nat Turner himself ever does is half as compelling or convincing.Four stars for the film maker's courage in attempting to tell the story. It was a risky move -- and he sure paid the price."
" Race Bating?

Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915) was a pioneering masterpiece in the film world I finally watched it in 2009. Then I gave it a 1 star rating and wrote this in my IMDb review: ""I find the intellectual airy fairy commentary in the 10's section of the reviews here to be disturbing. Frankly, I think you people should be ashamed of yourselves for promoting this disgraceful homage to slavery and murder. Slavery is at the very least murder of the soul. But we all know that was the least of it's offenses. ""The Birth of a Nation"" is a bad film because it promotes a reprehensible ideology. The merits of it's production values are irrelevant. And not that it should make a difference but for the record, I am a southern white male."" Readers at IMDb have rewarded me with a 46/92 rating. What a surprise. What we have here 100 years later in the new ""The Birth of a Nation"" (2016), finally, is the truth about slavery. Even ""12 Years a Slave"" was too cowardly to go where Nate Turner has gone. THAT film, ""12 Years a Slave"", would have you believe that some slave owners were benevolent. Really... This film is unflinching in its accurate portrayal of what slavery in America was like. It is stomach turning to watch the horrific beatings, rapes, torture, and just general bondage of people; and what other choice could there possibly be? Not showing it and pretending it didn't happen? Then add that it was conducted as routine commerce. Yes, other humans, slaves, were bought and sold; and there were no legal restrictions on what you could do to that person. These Crimes Against Humanity were done in the name of God, Christianity, and the U.S. Constitution. In the 40's when it was Hitler and the Holocaust we prosecuted and executed those responsible. Here, we just call it a difference of opinion and ""states rights"". Ask yourself this: is it possible to be a Christian in America during the slave holding years and, own, beat, and rape, other people because they have a different skin color than you; and then when you die be welcomed by God into Heaven? Just wondering. The performances by Nate Turner, Amie Hammer, Penelope Ann Miller, and others, are sensational for their commitment to authenticity. Actors are notorious for weakening their portrayals by forcing a sympathetic facet into the inventory of an utterly unsympathetic character. Kind of like trying to show the human side of Hitler. Armie Hammer does not fall into that trap. I knew he was in this film but I had trouble finding him only to discover that he was the behind the unrepentant face of a vicious slave owner with zero redeeming qualities. That takes guts and talent. Nate Turner is also good. His only weakness is that he is wearing so many hats in this production: lead actor, director, producer, screenwriter, etc. Being in that position is tough and he does it well. But he does a better job as director for his fellow cast members. His character, Nat Turner, is lynched in the end; and apparently with the many portrayals of lynchings inventoried in American cinema over the last 100 years plus, it has taken an African American producer/director/writer/actor to present that horrifying event from the perspective of the man being lynched/murdered. It is powerful and about damn time. Apart from this film's well crafted and honest depiction of the worst chapter in American history, it has served to magnetically draw out current day racists. This film turns race baiting on its head by telling the whole truth about slavery and drawing out racists who cannot handle it. Need proof? Read some of the reviews here with 6 stars or less. What's most amazing is that these reviewers are not even ashamed of themselves. So, racists? Unload! I'm looking for a worse than 46/92 here. Come on. I know you can do it."

" Amazing Story That Must Be Told
",0.5859,-0.9813,2017-06-27 00:00:00,8,"I cannot understand the hate this movie has received. The mere 6.3 rating (as of June '17) this movie received is far below what it deserves--in my opinion an 8, but a 9/10 would be perfectly understandable. I think it's mighty ironic that switched halfway through the boring Star Trek Beyond (7.1) to watch this riveting drama.Disclaimer: Perhaps it is due to the fact that I am black that I find slave movies fascinating for all the exact reasons I find World War II movies fascinating: the existence of a distinct, clear, and unforgivable evil in our history being shown on screen, as well as the pathos evoked by the victims of such evil. These stories become the ultimate drama, incapable of being considered melodramatic because of the real horror they portray. I like to think that the critical art consumer in me sees past this movie preference and can rate the film objectively.So why does this movie deserve an 8 or 9 out of 10? Excellent acting, a fantastic score, and the unapologetic and accurate brutality depicting a story of unquestionable heroism. Nate Parker becomes Nat Turner, a slave preacher in the 19th century who led a slave revolt. The pacing is excellent, you follow each rise and fall of multiple characters until Turner is pushed over the edge to commit his acts. It's been compared to Braveheart in other reviews (e.g. Matt Seitz at rogerebert.com) and I think that comparison is apt: it's bloody, inspiring, and perhaps too kind to the hero, but not in a way that ruins the movie. All of Turner's actions in this movie really happened, it's just the omissions that make it less than perfect.So this movie would deserve a perfect 10 were it not for some minor historical inaccuracies. For example, Turner's revolt also killed children, and while the slaves are shown killing women, they omitted the killing of kids. They omitted many of his ""visions"" that may have been signs of his mental illness. His death happened slightly differently. It's hard to think these revisions were done for any other reason than to make him seem flawless. But even those who opposed the violent evil that was slavery should be depicted for who they really were. This brings it down to an 8 for me. The overall movie is mostly accurate and incredibly well-told.I can speculate why this movie was rated poorly, even by those who haven't seen it; I urge those who would rate this movie lowly to please watch it anyway."

BIRTH OF A NATION (aka, WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE GRAPES OF WRATH) that the ONLY way to deal with Urban Unrest back in the 1800s was a thorough axle greasing (which gave rise to the expression, ""The squeaky wheel gets greased""). Now Director Benny Boom carries this theme forward with another True American Story, ALL EYEZ ON ME. Mr. Boom makes it clear that the protagonist of this Tragic Tale emerged from a deep gene pool of UltraViolent Urban Guerillas, not unlike Parker's earlier Nat Turner Doomed Hero. Abraham Lincoln was 22 years old when Nat got greased, causing this Great Emancipator to found the G.O.P. on a Repatriation Platform. Though as President, Abe was gunned down like NAACP Leader Tupac Shakur, Grateful Americans carved a giant replica of him on Mount Rushmore for his Great Idea. ALL EYEZ ON ME carries Parker's saga of Nat forward nearly 200 years to prove that America is NOT a safe or suitable environment for transplants with the characteristics of Nat and Tupac. It shows Tupac causing the death of an six-year-old from his own clan in a public park, while committing numerous other felonies against his misplaced cohorts. It shows some guy named ""Shug"" also engaging in countless violent felonies, as well as a stray prison-yard murder as another example of fraternal warfare. The U.S. Government is justly criticized for wasting nearly half its budget to lock up nearly all the Urban Males, and many of their Moms, such as Tupac's. Leader Trump MUST redirect a small fraction of this ""corrections"" budget to implement Abe Lincoln's own Grand Correction plan of repatriating a kidnapped, hostage population to the more suitable environment from which it sprang. Leader Trump should start with the Will and Jada Smith Crime Syndicate, which the ALL EYEZ ON ME whistle-blowers finger for Tupac's slaying, if not Shug's. The Streets of Chicago have been stained with ENOUGH blood, let alone L.A., Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Houston, New York, Philadelphia, etc. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 in favor of Leader Trump's Muslim Deportation Proposal Today, so it seems unlikely to scotch an idea adopted from the also revered Abe Lincoln which will curtail any more of this ALL EYEZ ON ME-style UltraViolence."

As a boy, he catches the eye of Penelope Ann Miller, mistress of the big house and wife of Sam Turner, a relatively easy going plantation owner. Miller teaches him to read between cotton-picking chores and he grows up to be a charismatic preacher, inspiring blacks and whites alike. The master buys a pretty young slave, Aja Naomi King, and she and Nat fall in love and are married.However, business is business, slaves are chattel, and King is sold to another family, a painful experience for the spouses. As Nat grows and gets around as a popular preacher, he witnesses the horrible indignities imposed on slaves perceived as truculent. Really. One man is shackled against a wall and has his front teeth knocked out with a hammer and chisel in order to force feed him.Nat is gradually turned against slavery, shows signs of ""uppitiness"" and is whipped, while the others put candles on their doorsteps as moral support. Finally, having had enough, Nat organizes a small rebellion and takes revenge on the most iniquitous red necks before the rebellion is subdued by the U. S. Army and all of the rebels are killed, including Nat Turner and countless innocent blacks, whether slave or free.It's artfully photographed and the lighting is dramatic and evocative. You can almost smell the magnolias. It looks more like Louisiana than Virginia, what with all the live oaks and Spanish moss. But no matter. The moonlight, the ethereal mist, and the thick-trunked trees turn the scenes into a kind of fairy tale, only it's the kind of fairy tale in which Hansel and Gretl get thrown into the oven.The acting is of professional caliber, with Nate Parker perhaps giving the weakest performance as Nat Turner. The action scenes are convincing.But now, ethics require that I crawl out from under the protective carapace of political correctness. I don't know that it's a particularly good idea to make films like this. Every racial, religious, and ethnic group has some history of persecution and suffering at the hands of an enemy. It's impossible to list them all, nor should it be necessary. The reason I'm suggesting that movies like this should be carefully crafted is that there is already enough divisiveness in the country as a result of slavery and there must come a time, sooner or later, when the bitterness has to abate. Nobody now alive was ever guilty of owning or whipping a slave, yet the anger has followed generations through the movement of time.I'm thinking of seeing a film, ""Glory"", in a black neighborhood theater and listening the audience's deafening cheers as the Union's black soldiers attacked and killed Confederates -- not an isolated incident because the same screams of joy erupted during a screening of a dismissable movie, ""Grasshopper,"" in which a furious Jim Brown beat the hell out of a villainous white man. The gulf between blacks and whites in this country is as wide as the Great African Rift. That's how a Swedish Nobel Laureate described it in 1944. We can forgive or forget nations we've been at war with -- Great Britain, Mexico, Nicaragua, Germany, Japan, Vietnam. Isn't it time to forgive one another's ancestors?The story of slavery and Nat Turner is powerful enough in its raw form. The director needn't have had Nat Turner smile while being hanged, and looking upward to see an angel descending for his soul. The angel is black. Is Nate Parker suggesting that there is a heaven for whites and a segregated heaven for African-Americans? I apologize if this offends anyone but it's all very confusing.Well, whatever propagandistic value the film has, it's worth seeing based on it's aesthetic and informative merits. We don't hear much about Nat Turner's rebellion. We might hear even less if William Styron hadn't written a popular book about it."

What's ""typical"" is the response from certain reviewers (read:white) who seem hung up on Nat Turner's actions rather than the REASON why he acted the way he did. These reviewers are aghast that the real rebellion resulted in the deaths of ""innocent"" white women and children of slave holding families YET they conveniently sidestep the feelings of a slave having known that 'massah' and any other white male could sexually denigrate his wife, sister, mother, or preteen child at any time. It's almost like white males are supposed to be ""entitled"" to do whatever they felt and if someone who is impacted ""reacts""- like Nat Turner- then that person is at fault. In real life Nat Turner may have killed white women and children in the rebellion but these same ""so-called innocent"" white people didn't have any heartburn over the inhumane brutality suffered ad nauseam by black women and children. Based on many reviews seems like the same savage primitive attitudes of many whites haven't changed in the past 185+ years since the events of this movie."
" A gritty tale of how religion and sexual abuse inspired a slave rebellion.
",-0.3612,-0.9937,2017-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Films about racist national histories are part of an ongoing quest for redemption. The history and scale of America's film industry has given it more opportunity than others for storytelling about its past, and slavery remains pivotal in its national narrative. While many slavery-themed films are framed around the fight for freedom and equality, others explore less noble themes like revenge, sexual abuse, and the manipulation of religion. These latter themes are featured in The Birth of a Nation (2016).The film's title is an inverted homage to the notoriously racist 1915 cinematic milestone of the same name. That film led to a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan and a century of racial turbulence that ranged from legally sanctioned violence to still unresolved systemic discrimination against African- Americans. The 2016 film is based on the legendary but true tale of black slave Nat Turner who led America's first revolt against white owners in 1831. As a young boy, Nat was told by a shaman that his body markings signified he was a prophet. His slave-owner family made him read bible passages and he grew up to become a gifted religious orator. In harsher economic times, brutality against slaves increased and many attempted to escape. Nat's slave-owner sold his services as a preacher, to give sermons that black servitude and white supremacy was God's will. As he witnessed increasing violence against slaves and the violation of black women, including the rape of his wife, he turned from preacher to revolutionary. His oratory inspired others to join in a brutal rampage of white killings before he and his small army were all hanged.This is a cinematically important film, despite the ambivalence some may have over the messianic depiction of Nat Turner (played by director Nate Parker). It has an epic quality that covers several decades of history and it reaches into the very core of American race-relations mythology. The narrative dynamic emanates centrally from Nat which sets the film on a 'great man in history' trajectory. However, the birth of the anti-slavery movement undoubtedly had a more complex set of social and political influences than an angry man's quest for rape-revenge. Nate Parker skilfully manages his characterisation of the many sides of Nat Turner and he is well-supported with a predominantly African-American cast. While the depiction of brutality echoes many similar period- drama films, the triggers for rebellion portrayed in this film and the role played by religion cast the history of black America in a different light.For the most part, this film depicts the slavery era with gritty and bloody realism. Many viewers will wonder if the director became carried away with the theme of Turner as the slave messiah, particularly in the disappointingly corny climactic moments when he is about to enter the kingdom of angels. However, the importance of the film outweighs its uneven direction and melodramatic stereotyping by shedding light on lesser known aspects of African-American history."

",0.5719,-0.4588,2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,Social Esteem is an important human right. Parallels with the Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith come to mind with the brutal rebellion of Nat Turner and the men who accompanied him. The Klu Klux Klan began as a backlash but in reality the conditions of slavery prior to Nat Turner's righteous uprising were easily comparable. They were difficult and dark days that overwhelmed and overcame Nat's owner who in the end proved to be no better than his neighbors. Manipulation of soul and body for the profit of power and domination must come to an end sometime. A Christian burial and due respect to the remnants of the rebels remains seems a fitting beginning to give this important historical event the social esteem it demands.

The movie never really takes off and by the time it gets to it's main point there is only 30 mins left. Before that we spent an hour and a half wondering what the hell the movie is about. The purpose and the main topic of the movie should have been introduced much earlier. Also I would have expected a much more violent approach that would've brought the message across much clearer. The whole movie seems more like a one man show and it appears more like stage for Parker to show off his acting skills than a serious movie about an important topic of the history of America. Apart form some nice crane shots and Parkers solid acting there is not much good to say about this movie. All in all I must say I was very disappointed and I hope that someone makes a remake of this movie and shows the story much clearer.

",-0.128,-0.9932,2017-03-30 00:00:00,7,"A good film , though it has extremely violent events , sadism , physical abuse , lynchings and other racist excesses . Nat Turner's Rebellion , also known as the Southampton Insurrection , is set against the antebellum South , it follows Nat Turner (Nate Parker), a literate slave and preacher , he was highly intelligent and learned how to read and write at a young age and he grew up deeply religious and was often seen fasting , praying or immersed in reading the stories of the Bible . Then , his financially strained owner , Samuel Turner (Armie Hammer) , accepts an offer to use Nat's preaching to subdue unruly slaves . Later on , there takes place the brutal sexual assault by white men on Turner's wife (Aja Naomi King) , it feeds a rage that sets the rebellion in motion . Soon after, , Nat leads a slave rebellion that took place in Southampton County , Virginia, during August 1831 . As Nat orchestrates an Southern uprising in the hopes of leading his people to freedom . The film packs crude scenes full of brutality and cruelty in which the African-American slaves suffer humiliations , flagellation , beating , degradation , and mistreats by their owners . As Nat Turner witnesses countless atrocities - against himself and his fellow slaves . As Nat Turner well played by Nat Parker carries out an upheaval against the ruthless proprietaries in the antebellum South , this rebellion occurred in Southampton Co. VA. August 21- 23, 1831 . Nat Parker gives an acceptable acting as the literate slave and preacher who orchestrates a bloody riot . Support is frankly fine , such as : Penélope Anne Miller , Aja Naomi King , Gabrielle Union , Mark Boone Junior , Colman Domingo , Aunjanue Ellis , Dwight Henry , and special mention for Jackie Earle Haley as the villain slave hunter Raymond Cobb , among others . It displays a thrilling as well as sensitive musical score by Henry Jackman , adding evocative African songs . Colorful cinematography by Elliot Davis , being shot on a former plantation between Springfield and Clyo, Georgia, about thirty miles north of Savannah . The picture was well shot by Nat Parker and it was filmed in a month , approx . Nat has filmed with all of the power and realism at its command but some scenes in exploitation style , including strong tortures , lashing , rape , grisly killings and many other things .This ¨The birth of a nation¨ is correctly based on true events , these are the followings : Turner rebellion was, according to his own writings, based on spiritual visions . Turner had various visions , as ""the Saviour was about to lay down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and the great day of judgment was at hand"" . Nat attempts to challenge racism and white supremacy in America, to inspire a riotous disposition toward any and all injustice in this country and abroad and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change . Led by Nat Turner, he started with several trusted fellow slaves, and ultimately gathered more than 70 enslaved and free blacks, some of whom were mounted on horseback . The rebels traveled from house to house, freeing slaves and killing all the white people they encountered. Because the rebels did not want to alert anyone, they discarded their muskets and used knives, hatchets, axes, and blunt instruments instead of firearms. The rebel slaves killed from 55 to 65 people, the highest number of fatalities caused by any slave uprising in the Southern United States. A white militia with twice the manpower of the rebels and reinforced by three companies of artillery eventually defeated the insurrection . The rebellion was put down within a few days, but Turner survived in hiding for more than two months afterwards . The rebellion was effectively suppressed at Belmont Plantation on the morning of August 23, 1831. There was widespread fear in the aftermath of the rebellion, and white militias organized in retaliation against the slaves. The state executed 56 slaves accused of being part of the rebellion . In the frenzy, many non-participant slaves were punished . Approximately 120 slaves and free African Americans were murdered by militias and mobs in the área . Across the South, state legislatures passed new laws prohibiting education of slaves and free black people, restricting rights of assembly and other civil rights for free black people, and requiring white ministers to be present at all worship services."
" Book and non-violence versus weapon and upraising.
",-0.296,0.9902,2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"The best thing about this film is the script that based on the real. Such films are really worth a watch, before that, worth to be made. But did it depicted accurately is what we don't know. So here the effort should be appreciated and everyone who involved in it. It was about the African-Americans during the early 19th century. The film focused on a boy who learnt to read and write became a preacher. He taught his community about all the good and bad. But it all comes into question when he realises that what he reads in the book is not the same in the real world. He has been in the path of non-violence all his life and now at the crossroad, he forced to take a weapon and fight back for the freedom.An inspiring film. If it was well written and made, would have been an Oscar material. Though the actors were good and well shot in locations. Nate Parker was brilliant in the lead, as well his direction was not bad, particularly in his first attempt. Previously, he had done some fine roles, but this is his best appearance. Perfect length and pace to sit for it patiently looking for the next events in the narration. Had some too much violence in a few scenes, but those were very much needed. Despite the film telling a true story, it did not appeal enough due to the lack of proper improvement in narration. Which I blame for not availability of proper information and records. Surely one of the best among in the year, not one of the top films of the year. So it is a must see then.7/10"
" Trump Supporters Campaign to destroy this Movie also on IMDb

" Terribly Slow And Uninspiring
",-0.5574,-0.9346,2017-03-04 00:00:00,2,"I love movies based on true stories, especially when the topic of slavery in antebellum America is concerned. Yes, there were several excellent examples, but this one is simply NOT of them. This one is extremely slow, boring, vapid, languid, uninspiring,gray, bland take on a Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831, and nay, it fails to deliver miserably on all levels. Even a whole team of good African-American actors could not save this mediocre take from dragging and falling into pieces already first hour. The further the film goes the more boring and terribly misfired it becomes, just a waste of time, effort and money. The nature is beautiful, several scenes are good, but all of them drown under a leaden weight of unimaginable lack of energy, drive or gusto. Nate Parker cannot deliver the main part as well, he is never above average or simply blank. No, sir, this is not the movie you'd like to watch to get a hefty history lesson on slavery. Glory was a mile better despite some drawbacks."
" The Birth of a Nation
",0.0,-0.9932,2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"Birth of a Nation is Nate Parker's directorial debut and I was initially sceptical about watching this film after the harsh criticism it received and the controversy around the portrayal of the events. The best way to describe this one for anybody that is not aware of the plot is ""Django Unchained"" meets ""12 Years a Slave"" although toned down slightly in budget and quality of direction. I loved this film a lot and the vision and passion that Nate Parker conveys with the script is unparalleled. Something that I was very concerned about with this film is whether or not it would fall into the trap of ""The Free State of Jones"" because many audiences complained that it was too long and boring however this film is consistently interesting and thought provoking from start to finish. Unfortunately, the editing throughout felt extremely rushed. It was almost as if they were scared to leave the camera on a character too long in case the audience lost interest and the editing is overall very sloppy which is one of the major flaws with the picture. I would have loved to see them take their time with the shots and extend the film to the 160 – 170-minute mark to allow for further character development but I understand why they didn't because of the hatred that previous similar films received. For the first hour of the film, it wasn't very emotionally captivating and I struggled to relate to the characters a lot. The film also loses its footing and trips over common clichés within the biographical war drama/ period piece films which takes away some of the innovation presented by the mostly superb cinematography. The characters should have been given more freedom to traverse the world as they often felt detached from the setting and environment of the film due to a lack of interaction. The film also features some very thought provoking metaphorical imagery although it often feels very forced and doesn't blend well with the structure of the narrative. An additional flaw with the film was that I felt that Nate Parker was trying way too hard in this role and was seriously desperate for acting recognition. That's perfectly understandable as this is his directorial debut although he has often quite obviously constructed scenes that allow him to stand out and seem the superior actor in relation to the rest of the cast. Moving away from criticisms on the film, what I thought it did really well was to eliminate the stigma surrounding historical settings in the film industry today where average movie goers often associate historical events as boring and tedious and I honestly can't imagine anybody being genuinely bored at this film. It just moves so fast and the events are truly brutal and relentless. Some of the scenes in this film are excruciatingly hard to watch and the film isn't scared to push the boundaries of the ""15"" certification. This really worked to its advantage to show the horrifying events although some viewers will be turned off by the onslaught of violence and torture. The personal peak of the film for me was the score. So expertly chosen to reflect the actions on screen and breathe life into scenes that are otherwise quite bland. The music really worked for me and there wasn't too much to the point where it felt like a music video much like other titles this year (Suicide Squad). The gore and injury detail is so well realised, absolutely horrific and shocking leaving some scenes cemented into audiences minds for days after watching the film. There was a singular scene towards the end of the film that absolutely floored me with its gruelling depiction of violence and rebellion which was followed by an uplifting and inspiring resolution and overall this film gave me way more than I could have hoped for or was expecting.

" Save yourself 2 hours and just read the reviews.
",0.4939,0.8986,2017-01-16 00:00:00,4,"The problem with THE BIRTH OF A NATION isn't the controversy surrounding the title, which it reclaims from the acclaimed 1915 silent film by DW Griffith. It also has nothing to do with the stigma surrounding the film's director Nate Parker and co-writer Jean McGianni Celestin, accused of raping a woman back in 1999. The simple fact of the matter, amidst a film festival circuit buzzing about Oscars for this little film, is that it is not that good.This is described as being a passion project for first-time director Nate Parker (who also stars in the lead role of a slave named Nat Turner), who financed much of the film with his own money and worked tirelessly to bring the forgotten story of a rebellion to the big screen. Based on true accounts, this is another film in the lives of the Antebellum south where slaves are brutalized on screen and audiences are meant to both marvel at the art while feel shame for living in a country with such dark historical chapters. There seems to be a resurgence of slave-based films, going back to Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" and followed by the masterful ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Lincoln."" In a time when race relations are at the centerfold of a political election cycle and splatter the front pages of the news every day, the subject matter has never been more relevant or controversial.There are certain moments in the film where an emotion rings true, or the camera catches a glance of something remarkable. Overall, I felt like I was rewatching a copy of better films. For a first-time directorial effort, this is in no way a failure of intent. Watching the film, I think Mr Parker simply paid one too many homages to similar films that have come before.Nat Turner is a slave who is raised to read and write by the wife of his master. Growing up, there is little evidence that Turner or his family experienced an onslaught of torture, and in fact his relationship with his mother and grandmother is in many ways the center of the film. When grown, Turner begins preaching the gospel, and word spreads of the ""colored preacher"" who may have a way to reach slaves in various plantations and bring them to the salvation of the Lord through sermons and prayer. He becomes a celebrity of sorts, brought house to house by his master, Samuel (Armie Hammer). Along the way, he marries, has a child, and begins to ponder the true meaning of the Bible and whether or not it flies in opposition to slavery itself.The story goes that Turner formed a militia of slaves from nearby plantations, murdered their owners, and worked their way to the center of town in attempts to overpower the whites and bring about a coup where slaves all over the South would rise up in opposition. Set in 1831, this occurred no less than 30 years before the Civil War, and the idea that tensions were bubbling up for so long only helps one to realize the fragile state of the country during the time of slavery.The story of Nat Turner itself is a beautiful testament to God and the idea of self-worth. In the hands of a more skilled filmmaking team, there is no doubt that this story could have been a movie worth remembering come Oscar season. There is simply no subtlety in the film, which recreates similar movies nearly shot-for-shot, including a final execution scene that is all but plagiarized from the finale of ""Braveheart."" We have seen movies that deal with outsiders coming together to overcome a great challenge before, and when watching ""Nation,"" there was very little to distinguish it as more than white noise in a tapestry of repetition. Even the final fight and coup amounts to little more than 20 minutes of the film and features the standard villain who eventually faces his death in a moment meant to illicit cheers from the audience (in fact, this scene felt like something straight out of ""The Patriot,"" another Mel Gibson film about revolution and war).As an actor, I can attest to the strength of Nate Parker's performance as a man who comes to term with his own destiny. I can also praise Aja Naomi King who plays his wife, Cherry - a woman bought as a throwaway slave but ultimately becomes the catalyst that gives Turner his strength and devotion. I can separate the controversy from the film itself. I think most artists should have their work judged separately from their personal selves, regardless. It's just a disappointment that there's not a whole lot to write home about."
" Great Film from Beginning to End
",0.6249,0.9916,2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"I typically shy away from these types of films because they are emotionally tough to handle for me. But I was urged to see what all the fuss was about.From its beginning, I could tell that this was going to be a real ""film"" not a typical American ""movie"". The opening scenes were nothing short of captivating. From the imagery to the film score to the basic camera-work. It was all very well executed.It seemed real, as if you were actually there. The characters seemed very relatable and embodied a lot of the traits in people we know today.The historical accuracy has been a hot topic, but I still haven't read a cogent argument that challenges the basic historical framework of the plot. It can serve as a useful tool in history classrooms to show a very important figure in American history.So I'd recommend everyone see this film. It's definitely worthy of all the coveted awards it received, including Sundance's U.S. Jury Grand Prize for Directing. I can't wait for the great Nate Parker's next work."
" Great American Story
",0.6249,-0.9043,2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"This is a GREAT American story that must be told. This story depicts the majority of our American history and Nat Turner is one of the more famous slaves to rebel against his captors. Mr. Turner is famous because he didn't only want to escape, he wanted to turn the tables and exact some revenge. Mr. Turners story has all but been lost in the history books because the fear of mutiny strikes fear in the hearts of all oppressors. I highly recommend the movie, especially to parents with children that are at an appropriate age to discuss bigotry, racism and other atrocities. This movie is a fantastic conversation piece."
" A Story Well Told
",0.2732,-0.9581,2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"Let me begin by saying the film, Birth of a Nation, is a fictional story based on the events of Nat Turner's attempt at leading a slave rebellion in August 21, 1831, in Southampton County, Virginia. Personally, I thought this film was a story well told. The pace is deliberately slow, pulling the viewer into a terrible world, experiencing the unjust nature of a white community regarding blacks as less than human. The story captures the ubiquity of this attitude and the sense that one's life as a black person had little value. While brutality and cruelty against blacks are evident throughout the entire movie, the graphics of such behavior are kept to a minimum; which I thought, in conjunction with other details, both subtle and overt, worked very well in conveying the fearful environment in which slaves had to endure their entire lives. The story proceeds in a manner that the viewer has to consider the ultimate actions of the protagonist, who is pushed to the edge of the abyss and chooses to make decisions that will affect himself as well as others. Unfortunately, this film has invited a number of commentators who are, in my opinion, racists, white-supremacists, and whites who don't care to hear about this time in our country's history or seek to disavow and downplay the suffering of blacks. Also, I strongly disagree with comments which claim this film is a ""sanitized"" version of said history. This film's atmosphere is created in a more subtle nature and with regards to its historical accuracy, seriously, it's an artist's fictional telling of events and, as a well-told story, I would certainly recommend viewing Birth of a Nation."

Most people just sat in the theater, in the dark, at the very end. Then, lights up, and a standing ovation. I've never seen this kind of response to a movie. When a filmmaker can have this kind of impact on an audience, you know you are doing something right. I hope this film replaces the other Birth of a Nation, as a reference point. The movie was beautifully acted. The settings and costume were realistic. The pacing was fluid. Any issues I had, which were minor, I can chalk up to a novice filmmaker and a skeleton budget.

" Easier to watch than 12 Years A Slave and one that is very much worth seeing, but nothing earth shattering either.
",0.3589,0.7681,2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"""You got purpose, its in you."" Nat Turner (Parker) is a different type of slave. He is literate and a preacher. He is treated better than most slaves and remains calm and obedient. When he begins to speak to other slaves around the south he notices mistreatment and worse. No longer able to stand by and do nothing he leads a slave revolt that ends up changing the country. Going in I was expecting ""another brutal slave movie"" along the lines of 12 Years A Slave. While it did not shy away from the horror of slavery it was more about the reasons that led up to the uprising and had more of a Free State Of Jones feel than 12 Years A Slave. That fact alone made this easier to watch. I'm not 100% sure how historically accurate the movie is but it is a movie that should be seen and understood. Things like this can happen and people can take a stand not based on how they are treated, but how they see others treated. That is an important lesson. Overall, easier to watch than 12 Years A Slave and one that is very much worth seeing, but nothing earth shattering either. I give this a B."

This act not only serves to sooth any agitated slaves, but to also line his master's pockets.Having to bear witness to all of the inhumanities ignites a rebellious flame in Nat, and soon his sermons turn to declarations of mutiny against their slave masters.A powerful and poignant depiction of the real life 1831 slave revolt that ravaged Virginia, this debut by controversial director Nate Parker may accentuate the story slightly but still delivers an impactful and stirring message.

Not because of it's inability to keep me enthralled, but rather due to the it's in your face portrayal of the early lives of African American slaves in the USA. We have all read and watched movies based in this time and subject. The brutality and victimization is ours to deal with and reflect upon. The movie flows well from beginning to end. The characters are well thought out and develop cleanly in the film. The dialogue seemed sometimes forced and coercive but nonetheless keeps true to itself. The scenes of immense degradation were tough to view but essential to the plot and the movie. I commend the fact that the title ""Birth of a Nation"" was reclaimed in a movie about strength and fortitude rather than it's predecessor of cowardice and fear."

This movie actually shows what is still going on in the present day, the only thing is that these kind of inhuman state systems are being hidden. The poor thing is everyone knows about how much people are suffering just right now, but the majority is unfortunately composed of ignorant characters. I hope this movie will bring some ideas into people that are behind these world order systems. The performance of the actors were perfect. Especially the leading actor Nate Parker, this is a top performance and a very realistic art. I will support Nate Parker's career by trying to watch all of his movies, seeing that he directed and played such a good movie. I hope that one day a country that is full with justice, is righteous, and doesn't enslave people(note: there is no difference between the modern and old slave system), gives equal rights to everyone will rule over the world and cure all these racist diseases, and prevent them from happening again. This movie shows that God will at the end give strength and victory to the people that have suffered because of racism and injustice. This is just like the term Karma, which has the same meaning, you can do bad for a little while, but after that things will turn sides, and the people responsible for such inhuman acts will regret the bad they have done."
" Birth of a Nation might not be perfect but it is a competent retelling about a catalytic moment in the black freedom struggle.
",0.7004,-0.9165,2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"History favours the brave, but like any form of art, it is also about perception. Whether that perception is a result of inner expression or manipulated by external influences, what matters is the manner in which it is told. Bold, controversial and violent, The Birth of a Nation is a period drama that is as powerful as it is important. Most of all, this film functions as a cinematic memorial to one of the first freedom fighters that would eventually give rise to the American Civil Rights Movement.His name was Nat Turner and although not shown in the film, he received the same fate as the fictionalized William Wallace (who was famously portrayed by Mel Gibson in Braveheart). Played by Nate Parker in his directorial debut, Nat is a slave with compassion for his fellow slaves. He is also in good standing with his master Samuel Turner (Armie Hammer) but the latter has problems of his own, including mounting debts and alcoholism. They were friends since childhood and Samuel's mother was the first to notice Nat's incredible ability to read (this was a time when literacy was considered a gift, and rare even for white landowners). With this 'ability' Nat is allowed to preach the Bible to other slaves with the intention of putting the fear of God into them. It works for some time, until Nat witnesses the ugly and often heinous atrocities of slavery. The inevitable happens when Nat perceives scripture as a double-edged sword – that which justifies slavery and that which justifies retribution.Based on the actual 1831 salve rebellion in Virginia, and co-written by Parker, The Birth of a Nation is a slow burner during its first two acts. Visual artistry notwithstanding, Parker's nuance is the cogs and wheels turning in Nat's head. Did he snap or was he disillusioned by his own sermons? Although the result is an explosive finale that is both brutal and disturbing, the answer to that question lies in the way Nat is perceived. With collateral damage on both sides, history has all but condemned Nat Turner as a mass murderer, much like what English history says about Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace. But the director has us believe otherwise; that Nat was more like a hero whose actions influenced a far bloodier war 30 years later in the emancipation of slavery, and hence the title.Yet at its core, this film is a penetrating enquiry into the ongoing struggles for justice and equality, the fine line between the use and abuse of authority, and also whether the history taught today is factual, or eroded, or sanitised. Whether Nat lost his faith or manipulated scripture to justify his rebellion is of little importance because The Birth of a Nation is competently made and told with grit. Like Steve McQueen's relentless 12 Years a Slave before, the theme on dehumanisation is rampant and doesn't let go even during its most harrowing moments. Even so, Parker's narrative may not be as flawless as McQueen's Academy Award winning masterpiece but it's still an effective undertaking for a debut director; And given the racial uproar behind the new Trump administration, perhaps even a well-timed film that takes a stab at a challenging dilemma – intention versus action."
" A movie that needed to be made
",0.0,-0.9965,2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"This is a story that needed to be told accurately even though it is incendiary and painful. It's obvious there were many tough choices to be made in what to portray. Because it's a true story all the more reason for making everything balanced and fair. This is a movie that falls somewhere between Django and 12 Years in tone. No Django like heroics would be right. I think that despite some faults they got the balance more right than not.The brutality against the slaves has been shown so many times on screen before but it's well portrayed here - the rape, mistreatment, murder, abuse and of course whipping by every kind of evil white plantation owner. What's different here is the ludicrous preaching that was used to keep the slaves in line. Some less one dimensional plantation owners are shown too. On the other hand it's difficult to make a movie about the uprising accurately including all the brutality of killing women and children and still keep sympathy for the slaves. Some accuracy had to be sacrificed for the sake of the story by leaving that out. At at time like this where racial conflict is the worst in decades, it is an incendiary movie. The problem is the Braveheart aspect of this movie could incite hatred but if it happened why shouldn't it be told? The acting is good. Nate Parker as Nat Turner reminds of a young Denzel but less indignant. Aja Naomi King as his wife Cherry is quite good too. She had an irritating look in some CW show before but that's all gone here. Armie Hammer is surprisingly believable as the slave owner who was okay turned not so good. His disguise of ugly beard and bad teeth worked well. Penelope Anne Miller is suitably sad looking as the good bt helpless white woman.Troubling and painful."

For your better understanding i will use comparing with other movies. So, you probably know that almost every year film-industry give us historical movies based on slavery-racism-segregation problems in US. It is a standard situation, it always was and always will. Some of the movies gave us deep dramatic stories with good directing and brilliant acting like in ""12 years of Slavery""(2013), ""Selma""(2014) and "" The Help""(2011), and some films was just a blood- action like ""Jango""(2012) although it was tried to hide under the mask of ""historically fair"" drama. What are you going to see in ""The Birth of the Nation"" is a mix of all mentioned movies + one more iconic 'brave' guest. Nat Turner from his earlier years knew that he was not typical child that he has special role in this life, this idea was predicted by slave-African shaman. Children years, brought double values into Nat life, one side he saw brutal life-lesson from head hunters on other side he was deeply integrated into Turner family (with help of Elizabeth Turner)where he learned to read and to carry word of God to the people. When his master (Samuel Turner) wanted get money on his preacher-slave by renting 'abilities', Nat saw hidden true life of that time. Anyway, we get product based on historical true events, but looking deeply on it - you can see only mix of different movies for each part; part where we see slave-live, based on - ""12 years of slave"", revenge from priest-rebel, based on ""Jango"", ...result of this revenge-revolution - ""Brave Heart"". Maybe Director (on behalf Writer) aka Nat Turner - Nate Parker used old rule: ""Good Artists Copy; Great Artists Steal"", when he made first debut film? But if to be very true, you will not feel any sorry for Priest-rebel at the end of movie. Because what he did, and the result what he received - can not be called - ""The Birth of Nation"""
