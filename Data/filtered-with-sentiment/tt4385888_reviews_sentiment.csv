" I'm glad this film was made
",0.4588,0.802,2021-04-07 00:00:00,9,This is an incredibly personal and intimate film. It explores the lifeline at several various stages and touches on the fragility of all of this.The story telling is unconventional and the performances are strong. The lighting and camera is subtle. It's beautiful without drawing attention to itself.... except when it's intends to do so.
" A wonderful movie with great perspective
",0.8316,-0.1306,2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"I don't know how people can't like this , I say forget the reviews and just watch it. You can thank me later ."
" Simple, Yet Effective
",0.4767,0.9896,2021-03-13 00:00:00,8,"I can't quite explain why I find this film so compelling. It's one of those movies that I know won't move everyone, but for what it's worth, I believe that 20th Century Women is an enjoyable watch for many reasons.One: The choices in regards to the films' structure and style are arguably eccentric, but they function so strongly within the narrative that I can't imagine this story being told any other way. The emphasis on exposition and visual aids was certainly risky -- they pay off because the film welcomes them with open arms.Two: Annette Bening is absolutely incredible. This was actually the first film I ever saw her in, and she gives a performance that is so grounded that you empathize with her right away. Her character is one that longs to understand everything modern, specifically her teenage son, yet too often cannot get past her own ""old-fashioned"" ideals. She's the kind of woman that we all know of (she may even be our own mother), and Bening plays her with so much charm. The entire supporting cast is wonderful as well.Three: The themes of parenthood and generational ideologies are very well done, and for a film set in 1979, still relevant today. Whether it be the indie rock scene or the spirituality of menstrual cycles, 20th Century Women shows how everything can turn into a debate, and a topical one too. The movie is timeless in how it approaches the gaps that form between people -- from parent to child, women to man, women to women, and kid to kid -- and how we can start to overcome those differences.20th Century Women is not a perfect movie by any means -- the pacing is slow at times, and certain scenes feel unnecessary to the plot. That said, it is a simple and sweet story that never loses sight of its message. At the end of the day, what more do you need?"
" One of the most beautiful and deep movies about relationships and coming to an age kind of film
",0.6361,0.9899,2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"""20th Century Women"" completely took me under guard, and I was not expecting such a deep and beautiful movie. In two hours, it manages to introduce and develop many important topics. It exploits a difficult and interesting relationship between a single divorced mother and her teenage son. Can be also considered part of the whole coming to an age wave, showing the struggling of young boys and girls trying to understand who they are and what they want out of life, this is well portrayed by Jamie and Julie. All this in an era where society was deeply changing, new values were arising thanks to the more liberal approach toward sex, intimacy, alcohol and drugs. This is very well highlighted by the music.Speaking of which, I have to really praise the soundtrack. It contains a really good mix of punk/rock 70s tracks and old 40s and 50s music. This establishes even more the clash between two generations, that despite their differences, manage to find some common grounds and come together in the end. I really liked how the story was developed: we are able to listen thoughts of main characters, which is their story and which are their struggles. This really made me bound and care for them. I was glued on my TV from the first minute, until the very end. Never felt bored once and I think that the runtime is just perfect. I do not say this a lot about movies.Acting is amazing, I personally liked Elle Fanning, and I truly believe that here she showed how skillful she can be. I enjoyed as well Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig and Billy Crudup. A little bit disappointed Lucas Zumann. Don't get me wrong, he was not bad, however something in his interpretation was missing, and he did not fully convinced me.I truly enjoyed how it was shot and there are a few sequences that are very visually appealing. Director was not scared to push a little bit boundaries, making few experimentation here and there, playing with colors and filters, but he never overdid, maintaining a very nice vibe. What to say? I definitely recommend it and I personally think that this is one of the best films that A24 released. This company until now never disappointed me. I don't even know how this is possible."
" Toddles along. No dynamic storyline. No real actor's chemistry. Not bad, nothing exciting either. Kinda boring...
",0.5031,0.7254,2021-02-22 00:00:00,5,"No drama. No fun. No action. No suspense. No originality.Is it bad? No, not really. But it just toddles along, without ever becoming a gripping portrait. It's lacking life...I know, I know, it is suppose to be laid back and slow burning and eighties kind of cool, but it just does not sparkle. And it lasts for almost 2 hours.Not any good? Well, the actor's are good in other movies. They are still worth watching. But you gotta have the patience of wanting to watch paint dry..."
" Its a fine portrait of growing up in an aging Time.
",0.3612,0.4019,2021-02-20 00:00:00,6,"I believed every character, they felt authentic. I appreciate that they are flawed. More often the film becomes too vocally informative, to a preaching degree causing a tonal shift of sorts."
" Annette Bening is outstanding
",0.6124,0.9942,2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"20th Century Women (2016) was written and directed by Mike Mills.Annette Bening stars as Dorothea Fields, who is a single mom living with her son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann). Three other people play important roles in the movie and important roles in the life of Dorothea and Jamie.Greta Gerwig portrays Abbie Porter, who lives as a tenant in the home. Billy Crudup plays William, who is also a tenant. Elle Fanning portrays Julie Hamlin, who is bonded to Jamie, but refuses to have sex with him. (She is sexually active, but not with Jamie.)The ensemble acting is superb, and director Mills knows just when and where each character belongs on the screen. As good as the others are, Annette Bening is truly outstanding. Bening is the Sun, and the other characters revolve around her like planets.The movie is worth seeing in any case, but even without the interesting plot it would be worth watching just to see Bening at work. I highly recommend it.We watched the film on the small screen, where it worked well. 20th Century Women has a pretty good IMDb rating of 7.3. I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 9."
" It's slow, but very good
",0.6474,0.9649,2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"The movie is very slow, and at times I wished it would move along, but overall it is a quality movie with very good acting. As a man I found it interesting that the story was called 20th Century Women, since from my personal prism I saw it more of a coming of age story about the male son. However, I can definitely see how someone else would focus on the women as the central protagonist(s) of the story.To help with this slow pace, sit down with a glass of wine and enjoy this movie as the lives of each of the characters is slowly revealed."
" Subtle and Heartfelt
",0.5423,0.9975,2021-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Depressing but ultimately heartfelt. I came out smiling more than I cringed. I went inward more than I like to while escaping into film, but it made me do so in a way that had me come out feeling better than when I went in.The story is simple enough. A depression-era mother raises her fifteen year old son in 1979 with the help from house guests that rent rooms out from them. There's a lot about feminism, the world around them, and how each person deals with that in a group and on their own.The film had a number of deep, well-thought lines of diaglogue that make for great quotes about life. One of the first is when Jamie, the son, asks his mother Dorothea if she is happy. ""Wondering if you're happy is a great shortcut to just being depressed.""The second, is when Dorothea is talking to one of the housemates about being with her son at a bar.
""You get to see him out in the world, as a person. I never will.""
This line really gutted me. You think about parents, about how much they love their children and how much they want them to be healthy and happy and grow up to be good people. After all that, they turn into teenagers, rebel against their caretakers, then go off to live life away from them. Parents so rarely get to see the people their children turn out to truly be. To be a fly on the wall. To be embarrassed of them, embarrassed for them. To be proud when they make the right decisions and just get to see them as they are when noone is around. It really is a soul-crushing idea. How dare they make me think about all that. And well done. Excellent writing. You can tell the the director Mike Mills took a lot from life and was able to put it in to meaningful and ponderous dialogue between characters.The story is done with subtlety that is character driven. Some of it is typical, but much of it will hit everyone at least once. The loneliness of growing into an adult, the isolation of being a parent, and the confusion of older generations seeing how the world is turning out are all areas that will hit close to home emotionally.All the actors were great, especially Bening, who I could listen to while she reads the back of a paint can and I'd have a smile on my face.It didn't feel like your typical American drama fare. There was far less screaming, death, and drama that usually goes in to these days. It was quiet, fast-paced, and organized into nice pieces. The drama was in the thoughts it left you with about your own life and the kind of life you want to leave for your children.How can we put the small amounts of what we know about the world into them without giving them the pieces we are embarrassed about? How can we urge them to find themselves and learn more than we could ever teach them, when we have our own pitfalls that stop us as individuals from becoming who we truly want to be?"
" WHAT A DEPRESSING SOUL-LESS MOVIE!!!
",-0.5386,-0.7303,2020-12-21 00:00:00,3,"I can't even believe this got so many good reviews?! While the acting was very good, the whole script wreaks of pathetic, lost people, who have no grounding, spiritual core and are obviously completely ""lost souls"".
I literally started out being able to relate as I too am a single mom who had my son at 33. I also was born in 1963, so felt like I could somewhat relate to the son. I was engaged to my son's father but had to keep postponing the wedding due to unhealthy issues he was dealing with. So in essence, I HAD to move out and became a full time single mother.
And yes, I lived far from my relatives, so was unable to rely on them for additional support. Yet, the craziness of how this mother was so closed off and irresponsibly raised her child really started to get to me, and make me nutso.
I think there are many single moms out there that do a GREAT job of raising a son. Where was the discipline? Where was the value-teaching? Such a sad pathetic film!!!"
" Sure this movie had some point..just wished I had seen it
",0.3182,-0.9684,2020-10-28 00:00:00,2,"This is more of a critique, than a review. Before I started the movie in my player, I read the reviews here on IMDB from others who have seen this film. I thought, nah, I'll watch it for myself. Well, for the most part, the reviews were right. Boring, tedious, preachy are words I would use on the surface for this film. Don't get me wrong, great performances from all the actors who were involved, but I never got THE POINT! Perhaps the message was lost because a male director/writer (Mike Mills)was writing/directing from a very screwed up female viewpoint. Was it a film about poor parenting? YES! Because THAT much was obvious. Was it a feminist/anti hetero male statement? Was it an anti smoker ad? Who exactly was spouting anti smoking garbage every 20 minutes back in 79?? Maybe Mills himself is a confused feminist? If being confused, or listening to confused people talking on and on for 2 hours is your thing? Then go for it. Don't really know, but I'm going with the majority on this one and say SKIP IT!!!"
" Almost something special
",0.3446,0.9738,2020-08-06 00:00:00,8,"This movie has done a brilliant job of making you feel and care for its characters. As the film progressed, I felt deeply attached to these characters. The plot's realism and the character motives' realism add to the film's immersion. The acting is top-notch from top to bottom and the directing is also something to be marveled at. This film, from an artistic perspective, is a beautiful achievement.My key film negatives are the ending and the incidents leading up to the end. The film's final half-hour felt somewhat forced and rushed. The result the characters receive seems to happen sort of out of the blue with verbal indications given to the audience. In the context of the movie, it was still moderately effective for me, but I finished the film wanting more.Overall, it's a beautiful film with a flawless 1st and 2nd act. I would recommend this movie to plenty of people and do not regret watching it."
" Strong, plausible, characters lead this oft-told story.
",0.5106,0.128,2020-07-20 00:00:00,7,"Lucas Zade Zumann (""Jamie"") steals this 1970s coming of age drama as a young lad being brought up by his chain-smoking mother ""Dorothea"" (Annette Bening). Whatever you do, don't expect much structure to this - the premiss being that he is being brought up not just by his mother, but also by 3 other boarders whose approach to morals and ethics is about as varied as they come; with his mum trying to keep his compass broadly pointing in the right direction. It's a meandering tale about self-realisation; not just of the youngster but of his mother too as they have to deal with the regular issues that impact on any family - sex, drugs, drink etc. In itself, it isn't anything spectacularly new - we have seen these stories many times before; but there is a chemistry between the two leads - and Elle Fanning, Greta Gerwig and Billy Crudup contribute well as the purveyors of credible alternate scenarios for ""Jamie"" to sample."
" Warm trip back to the seventees
",0.2263,0.93,2020-07-17 00:00:00,8,"Lovely character depictions by star actors, set in a beautiful time and place. Sit down, watch and connect to a series of believable and worthy people. Also, enjoy the nostalgia."
" Missing some pizzazz
",-0.296,0.6124,2020-07-15 00:00:00,7,I wanted to like this movie but it was just too slow most of the time. I didn't feel invested in the characters like I think I should have and the plot just fell short for me.
" Fails Miserably as a Period Piece
",-0.7096,0.7646,2020-07-12 00:00:00,1,"If you are a younger person, and you think 1979 was as portrayed in this film, you have been seriously mislead. I was 17 in 1979. This film doesn't represent it accurately, except for a few Bohemian elitists from places like Coastal California or NYC. Even in those places, people and experiences shown in this film were quite rare.This film is so steeped in elitism its astounding. Annette Benning and Greta Gerwig are very talented actors, but they are unable to give this film any redemption. Don't waste your time."
" Great feel-good film and music
",0.6249,-0.6649,2020-07-11 00:00:00,9,"The film is great. The negative reviews are more about our current political divisiveness, than they are about the film. Trumpbillies won't give a positive review to a film that portrays Jimmy Carter or Annette Bening in a positive light."
" Watch the a game of acting
",0.0,0.9961,2020-07-10 00:00:00,8,"20th century woman is a showcase for all it's actors where they can shine because they play this wonderful characters. Everybody here is good top to bottom but Greta Gerwig, Elle Fanning are really standing out and even more so the absolutely incredible Annette Bening. How this was a ""only"" a Golden Globe nomination and not one for the Academy Awards is beyond me. In every scene she is just so believable but giving you a performance where you feel like you have not seen that before. After 4 Oscar nominations and performances like this one or in ""Film Stars don't die in Liverpool"" and ""Mother and Child"" she truly deserves the golden statue.
As for this movie it his great written characters, great actors a very unique score and the setdesign and locations are so gorgeous that you wish you could live there. It is about finding one's own identity and place in live, about pain, growing up and a mothers relationship to her son and vice versa. A great peace of art."
" Generation gap is inevitable, it's natural
",0.3612,0.9062,2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
the screenplay is so refreshing and works as if it is a timeline that's guiding us to various span the movie is trying to tell the story. The characters are beautifully portrayed and the storytelling is nicely layered and explored.What did not work:
with many explorations and experiences the kid settles down finally with self realization, I would have been glad if that area was explored more.Final verdict:

" mother's private memoriesthe in 20th century
",0.0,0.1027,2020-05-12 00:00:00,10,"After six years, Mike Mills once again brought us a new work, this time about his mother's private memories. Also a semi-autobiographical creation, Mike Mills, through his unique perspective, cuts into the life styles of the last century from the perspective of women, allowing us to glimpse the cross-section of the 20th century American society and its several For generations, the differences in dealing with people and the very different pursuits of life together constitute the 20th century that people love and hate."
" Beautiful picture
",0.5994,0.985,2020-04-24 00:00:00,9,"Mike Mill's feminist picture - a real success. Beautiful storytelling and sublime acting about the realities of being a woman - a mother, a best friend, a daughter, and what it means to be raised by a woman. Every line written by Mills feels real and goes straight to the heart; a real sensitive and powerful piece. Beautiful cinematography by Sean Porter, everything about this film indicates strong artistic and directorial choices. Would definitely recommend a watch."
" A coming of age for all ages
",0.0,-0.4404,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"""It's 1979, I'm 55 years old and in 1999 I will die of cancer from the smoking. They don't know this is the end of punk. They don't know that Reagan is coming. It's impossible to imagine that kids will stop dreaming about nuclear war, and have nightmares about the weather. It's impossible to imagine HIV, what will happen with skateboard tricks, the internet."" -Dorothea FieldsExtremely heartfelt, funny, and heartwarming. A movie about the relationships we want to have instead of the ones we are expected to have, and about the people we want to be instead of who we ""should"" be. An homage to the present which ultimately shows us that the coming of age is not a moment, but rather a life."
" Why It Was Hard Growing Up In The 1970s
",0.0772,0.8564,2020-03-16 00:00:00,4,"This movie stars Annette Benning as the miserable failure of a mother and combines this popular theme with favorite of a decade or so ago, the It Sucks To Go Through Puberty in a Well-To-Do family in the 1970s theme. Miss Benning (who is wonderful in the role; I've been an admirer since The Grifters) is a Strong Woman raising her son on her own, but doesn't know what to do with a teen-age son, because she's a woman, so she enlists two other women, of course: Elle Fanning, who's friends with her son (who is in love with her) and sleeps with other boys; then she comes over to the house so she can TALK with the boy and sleep IN the same bed, but they're friends, really, so she can snuggle up to him, but he can't touch her. Also Greta Gerwig, who makes him read radical feminist tracts.Things go from bad to worse. I wonder why."
" An unconventional coming of age story
",0.0,0.6124,2020-03-09 00:00:00,8,"I real enjoyed this movie. From the incredible ensemble cast and the way each character's arch was developed, to the editing and sound editing which gave incredible depth to a lot of transitional scenes. This story about a young boy growing up in a house full of women and what is refreshing about it is that it is not told solely from his point of view."
" Beautiful
",0.5994,0.9935,2020-02-29 00:00:00,10,"There's a point in this movie where it goes from being a well directed drama to an emotional amd haunting meditation on the passage of time. It probably was always like that, but from that point forward the themes of the movie become a lot clearer. If you've seen it you probably know what specific scene I'm talking about.Growing up. Growing old. Dying.The cast is spectacular. Lucas Jade Zumann and Elle Fanning are great as the two childhood friends facing the awkwardness of sexuality.Annette Benning is, as usual, heartbreaking as the mother who must face the fact that his son is growing up.Billy Crudup is also great and has a great chemestry whith BenningThe real show-stealer is however Greta Gerwig. I knew she was a great actress from films like ""Frances Ha"", and of course we all know now that she's an amazing director, but her performance in this movie is out of this world. Everytime she is on screen the movie becomes even better than it already is. The fact that she wasn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar is criminal.The ending is heratbreaking and beautiful. It ties all the characters and themes togheter in an unforgettable montage that had me in tears.Beautiful"
" Like Seinfeld with more character and fewer jokes
",0.5423,0.9873,2020-01-18 00:00:00,9,"I'm rating this an 8.5 because its worth seeing for anyone attracted to the topic. Otherwise maybe closer to a 6.5 since it's short on amazement and thrills. The critics like it also, because its that kind of film: character-driven.For me, it's a romantic tragedy, like life, and not like life. All the characters are imaginary of course because it's fiction, yet occasionally presented at their genuine human best, like life, so I fall in love with them...except unlike life I can never know them any better than this, thus only romantic, not real, and that's tragic, and life is also romantic and tragic and sometimes very much like this story, except you know the people, so life is romantic, tragic and also truly thrilling and heartbreaking.I wouldn't suggest any improvements except finding a way to cut some of the filler. Of course some people would call those the best parts. Jus' sayin'."
" Fantastic Performances
",0.5574,0.9495,2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Blown away by this film, and the fantastic performances by the ensemble. Annette Bening, I don't know how you do what you do... so well. Greta Gerwig also knocked it out of the park, and there's a particular scene at the dining table, that will stay with me forever ~ in a good way! Mike Mills has become one of my consistent favorite directors in the past decade. Loved it!"
" Its imperfections make it shimmer all the more
",0.0,0.9989,2019-12-13 00:00:00,7,"Dorothea Fields (Annette Bening) is at a loss. She's 55, divorced, has a 15-year-old son, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), and lives in a crumbling joint with a quartet of disparate, lost souls. It's 1979. She's ""from the Depression"" (as Jamie recurringly relays) and feels hopelessly out of touch. She figures she had a kid too late, and will, as a result, never be able to fit his needs as adeptly as she'd like to. He's growing up in a world where young people worship punk heroes and manifesto toting intellectuals; she grew up in a world where merely surviving was the utmost priority in one's life - there wasn't time to rebel and there wasn't time tackle ennui head on. Jamie struggles to understand Dorothea and Dorothea struggles to understand Jamie. And that scares her. So she, without making her intentions clear, enlists the help of the two other women of the house, Julie (Elle Fanning) and Abbie (Greta Gerwig), to help raise Jamie in the ways she feels incapable of overseeing herself. Both women, luminous and promising as they are, though, are perhaps too distracted by their own problems to make such aspirations come to the idealistic fruition Dorothea's looking for. Julie is a troubled 17-year-old who interminably gets high and laid to cover the emotional scars left on her by a deficient family life that's prompted her to platonically sleep over with Jamie almost every night. Abbie is a radical 24-year-old photographer recovering from cervical cancer and wondering how her recent personal setback is going to affect her professional ambitions. How Dorothea figures either woman is going to help Jamie grow up to become a great man is perplexing, maybe even humorous because it's such a dizzy scheme (if you can even call it one). ""20th Century Women,"" aimless and emotionally tumultuous, is the third film of Mike Mills, the writer/director first who captured critical attention with black comedy ""Thumbsucker"" (2004) and then stepped into the Oscar conversation with ""Beginners"" (2011), the deeply moving family drama that won Christopher Plummer an Oscar for playing a 75-year-old man who comes out of the closet to his grown son. Like ""Beginners,"" ""20th Century Women"" is semi-autobiographical for its maker. ""Beginners"" is about his father, and ""20th Century Women"" is about his mother. But whereas ""Beginners"" was a focused, heartwarming account of renewed familial affinity and of the painful inevitabilities that come with death, ""20th Century Women,"" essentially without conflict, climax, or resolution, is scattered and fragmented, like a memory or a quickly pieced-together scrapbook. Mills is welcoming of the untidiness - he doesn't want emotional responses to arise between the travelings from plot point A to plot point B. He's more interested in seeing how we take to his assemblage of characters, who are, without a doubt, the film's most remarkable facets. These are the kind of fictional individuals, so hard to find in our ever crowded cinematic landscape, that think and breathe and feel; immediately after we meet them do we determine that they'll stick with us far longer than anything else in the film. And that people over story sentiment is both ""20th Century Women's"" biggest strength and greatest weakness. One can suppose that it has to be foundationally strewn - it is, after all, capturing a year in the life of five fickle entities who don't know what the hell they want out of their existence - but one can also suppose that Mills' unwillingness to let traditional structuring make its way onto the scene prevents us from becoming as immersed in the movie as we'd like to. We adore the characters living their lives in front of us, but we never feel like much more than passing friends if only because their motivations are mounted with scattershot energy rather than intimate precision. But our attachment toward ""20th Century Women's"" ensemble is enough to warrant impassioned commendation. Bening, incandescent and robbed of a deserved Oscar nomination, stuns as a woman so infatuated with providing her son with what she perceives to be the ""best"" upbringing that she ultimately loses sight of her own worth - and that a woman of a certain age can cinematically be represented not as an all-knowing mother but an always questioning flibbertigibbet is invigorating. Zumann, only 14, holds his own against heavyweights; Billy Crudup, as the former hippie who never much matured past his own ""Make Love, Not War"" days, steals scenes with his humorous evasion of societal conformity. But it's Fanning and Gerwig, actresses who grow more fascinating with every onscreen performance, who make the heftiest impression. Fanning, only 18, has proven herself as one of her generation's gutsiest performers - her filmography's seen her playing a transgender teenager in ""About Ray"" (2015), and it's also seen her portraying a would-be supermodel in auteur Nicolas Winding Refn's psychological thriller ""The Neon Demon"" (2016). Fanning rarely takes on a role that doesn't propose a challenge, and her characterization of Julie is no exception. She's alternately hilarious and poignant as a wild child simultaneously attracted to trouble like a moth to the flame and general familial stability. Gerwig, the independent film goddess quietly making waves in the industry, is ""20th Century Women's"" most touching character - she wants to be an artistic iconoclast and a youthquake who stands out in the crowd, but the setbacks that have infested her personal life have forced her creative appetite to come second to merely surviving. The movie finds her at her most vulnerable, and as a result does she become its most riveting character. Unlike the individuals constantly surrounding her, she's forever at odds with the person she is and the person she wants to be. Gerwig makes that uncertainty thrilling. But in essence are all the performers in ""20th Century Women"" thrilling - finding the emotional cruxes of their parts with exceptional detail, we, without fail, connect with Dorothea, Jamie, Julie, Abbie, and William and maybe even see a little bit of ourselves in them, in their unending attempts to figure out who they really are. One can wish that Mills' approach were less mosaic and more orthodox. The material would benefit from forthrightness. But there's a lot to love in ""20th Century Women,"" and, like life, its imperfections make it shimmer all the more."
" Very strong film. I don't understand all the negative reviews.
",-0.0276,0.988,2019-11-04 00:00:00,8,"This is a very strong film, unless you only like fast-paced action films; I'm going to go out on a limb and say you'll probably like this movie.As is the norm with A24... it's a good film.I don't really have much to complain about. I belied in the world of the film, I believed the characters were real, etc-- the world and logic of the film was well established. There were a few tropes of the genre, but some strong writing and direction makes one look past this without really thinking about it.
I actually cared about the story and wanted to see how things played out.The story is a bit disjointed, but I think that works to the film's benefit due to the type of storytelling it's going for, which overall is very effective.I'd recommend this film to pretty much everyone that likes good movies.8 out of 10"

",0.0,0.9833,2019-10-12 00:00:00,7,"A glimpse at a time in history, and a family upbringing that only Mike Mills knows. 20th Century Women is a unique little film, with a unique perspective of a matriarchy. It comes across as a split between a San Francisco ""Zine"" and a Noah Baumbach comedy. It explores the concept of what it means to be a better man, and how to learn how to be one in a house with no father. But visually speaking, Mills keeps it vivid, exuberant and fun. He authentically captures California in 1979, the punk-rock scene and early stage feminist movements. Ironically enough, this film premiered weeks before our modern day feminist movement took shape. Great performances define this film as well, notably Anette Benning. Standouts include Elle Fanning and Greta Gerwig as a pink haired hipster who not coincidently resembles Lady Bird. On another note, If you ever wanted to hear the best discussion of menstruation ever put on film, 20th Century Women has it. That's no easy task."
" I look for silky linings, but you're rotten to the core
",-0.6652,0.0814,2019-09-20 00:00:00,3,"A not unpleasant watch, but it felt like the elements refused to come together. The characters seemed so distant and only partially revealed.

The music is by far the most interesting thing."
" Felt a Bit Forced vs Realistic
",-0.4588,0.1233,2019-09-13 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)This film tried really hard to be unique, quirky and independent spirited but perhaps that is just an honest portrayal of the three women and a 13 year old boy as they all lack a solid life direction. The divorced mother figure is hippy-spirited and more of a 'friend Mom' than a parent. After her son survives a tragic accident, she asks two older girls to help give him direction during his early teen years. These two girls are deep into feminism and jaded or trying to find themselves as well. So this 13 year old boy has some interesting life lessons and the mother got more than she bargained for. Why would this mother sluff off so much important parenting to two girls still finding their own way in life? Is she just as lost as the others? This film addresses how and why people made life decisions; most often bad decisions. These three women try to teach the boy things they had wished they had learned earlier. There really isn't a core plot here; more of a snapshot in time and a peek into the minds of the characters as they look for direction from wherever. It was well-acted and well-produced."

" A quiet, intelligent masterpiece about who we are
",0.7964,0.68,2019-07-13 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this movie five times. The director, MIke Mills, is describing what it was like growing up in Santa Barbara in 1979. The acting is terrific. Dorothea is a single mother trying to raise a 15 year old son named Jamie. She worries when Jamie plays a game with his friends that lands him in the hospital. She calls upon two other women to help her. One is an artist who lives with them named Abbie. The other is Jamie's friend, Julie. They throw themselves into the task. Sometimes, it is comical. Abbie teaches Jamie how to pick up older women, and Julie teaches Jamie how to smoke. All the characters are very likeable, but they are all struggling with their own issues and Jamie seems to grow the most when he helps them out. Dorothea grew up during the Depression and struggles mightily to understand the Punk Rock scene. But what works in the end is that they all care about each other and they are all available to each other. 1979 is described as a pivotal moment in our history. A clip of Jimmy Carter's 'Crisis of Confidence' speech is shown when he railed against the growing fragmentation in our society. So, come for the acting and if you listen carefully, you will hear the film's quiet message about who we are."

" Beautiful story of family and growth
",0.7579,0.977,2019-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Mike Mills' 20th Century Women is one of the most purely crafted expressions of family and boundaries created in recent cinema. Once he had his daddy issues sorted in Beginners, the film that led Christopher Plummer to a stellar Oscar win, Mills sorted the motherly influence in the story of his teen approximation via a moody Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann) being mentored by women in three different places in their lives: Dorothea (Annette Bening), his mother torn between her Depression era upbringing and unconventional womanhood post-war; Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a cancer survivor dangling on the precipice of familial and cultural limitations; and Julie, the brazen friend bridging the sexual and platonic divide. This documentary of finding and losing their way is like a homey visit on rewatch.Fanning and Gerwig are never better in their free wheeling determination to be modern women, but Bening as the progressive but tiringly sensitive to the often assaulting change of the day. Wisdom--and certainly some seasoned incredulity and stubbornness--aid Bening in the pensive mother who can take in your assumptions to life and give a devastating response of ""Well, yes and no"" that has Film Twitter a buzz for many-a year. At odds with that great split between revolutions (be it WWII or the sexual revolution), Dorothea is strong enough to contend with tribal parenthood but she is unprepared for the velocity change has taken (If only she could see microgenerations in the world of social media!). Forced to see a world and a son changing in front of her eyes, Bening proceeds with cautious optimism at her son's future.The film never lets you ignore the passage of time; it somehow jumps around without ever losing the moment. Yet, you are given a fully realized creature: a lovingly constructed family ready for a seismic shift. 20th Century Women streams on Amazon Prime and Kanopy; please enjoy this tremendous movie from A24!"

This is a movie about women living in the ""me decade"" the way 'Willie Wonka & The Chocolate Factory' (1971) was about candy making. The fringe characters seemingly ignore the actual predominant cultural influences of the day (hair care, bad fashion and TV watching) that would have been inescapable except to prison inmates and grad students of the day. (It'd be like watching a movie about our present decade (""the teenies""?) but no one having a cell phone.) Similarly, the cultural zeitgeist is inaccurate. For example, the few men in this movie are inconsequential losers marginalized into roles as handymen or therapuetic sexual facilitators. HAH! Everyone knows that men's obseleteness is another decade away when Billy Crystal makes 'When Harry Met Sally' (1989). (But seriously, if any time travellers are reading this, forget Hitler - take out baby Crystal!) Dorothea (Bening) plays a too hip for any room older Mom informed more by pre war America then the affluence and bigness of post war America. She knows what is coming (the 80's?) and worries for her only son. She enlists a rag tag group of strays whose only apparent qualifications are availability and angst (again twenty years to early) to guide the boy into manhood. The predicament for Dorothea is, except for her son, she seems to like not giving a hoot about anything else. She resigns her self to her smoking habit and the fate therein and barters not with money but invites to dinner parties heightened only by the guests own social ineptness. The son (Jamie) lacks the charm or charisma to believe that anyone except Mom would take an interest in him. In fact, 'Jamie' probably grows up to be Billy Crystal's 'Harry'. Greta Gerwig is wonderful at nailing down the wistfully eccentric 'Abbie'. I'd watch her ""reading the phone book"". You know, because typically one associates reading a phone book as tedious and boring but she is so wonderful that it would still be worth it. Oh, did that explanation seem patronizing and condescending?! Well, that's how I felt watching this movie."

It's a coming of age film, with a boy that lives with his single and lonely mother. It's a feminist film. It's an era film. It's a tribute from the writer/director to his mother. It's a movie made by a guy from Berkeley. Yet for me it was a movie about open minded people, a little too ideal to be believed, but interesting to watch. It's a typical life movie, where the characters are more interesting than the story, if there is one.I like how the actors played, the direction was good. There were moments that I felt were real, maybe too real to enjoy - I got that speech with ""you love the image of me, not me"", too. I can't recommend it to everyone and you definitely need to be in the mood to enjoy it: a quiet evening with the spouse maybe. Young people have so many things to learn from it, yet they won't and it's just sad. Watch it. You might like it as much as I did."
" 70s nostalgia
",0.0,0.9312,2018-02-19 00:00:00,7,"In Santa Barbara, California during the late 1970s, Dorothea Fields (Annette Bening) is an unconventional single mother in her fifties raising a pre-teenage son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann) in a household that seems to contain a makeshift family which includes two single tenants (Great Gerwig and Billy Crudup) and a girl next door (Elle Fanning) who is two years older than Jamie.It's rather easy for the viewer to feel comfort around the folks in this commune-like home especially with Bening playing the head of the house. She exudes charm, warmth, and humour - especially in a scene when she is trying to understand the appeal of modern (at the time) punk rock music. The characters also bring us down memory lane when feminism was in its early stages. We see both the fascinating side of this movement and some of the absurd side.The decision to show what happened to each character's future at the end might not have been necessary with the exception of Dorothea's. The fate of the other characters seemed ordinary and conventional considering the unique experiences they shared in the 70s. However, this might be the point. Perhaps, this was a way of expressing grief for a period (the 1970s in this case though it could also be appended with the 1960s) when self-exploration and self-expression were much more attainable than in the decades that followed with mega-greed and less economic freedom for the average person.""20th Century Women"" could have been cut by twenty minutes or so but it was a nostalgia journey well worth traveling."

It is NOT boring. It has its pace and it is exacly what it has to be.
I identified myself at different levels. I was born in 1958, just like the main actress (great performance). And like Dorothea I had a daugther when I was in my 40s (she now is 15, like Jamie, Dorothea's son) and I don't know how to talk to her, I don't like much of the music she likes and so on. 
I was a teenager in the 70s, so I identified with Jamie, great character: I wish I had one thousandth of his self-consciousness when I was his age!This movie was oxygen for suffocating US major's movies, after sequels and remakes and CGI shows finally something to think about."
" Bening Couldn't Save This Clunker
",-0.3875,-0.9345,2018-01-27 00:00:00,3,"What a strangely empty, self-indulgent and ultimately meaningless movie this is. What poor use of a reliable cast. Bening is wasted in the role of a middle-aged, single mother of a teen son. Her strength is in her ability to use words - to speak; her voice. She has been given so little to say here; the script is almost non existent beyond the basics required to drive one pointless scene to the next. In the moments where there might be a confrontation of some sort, she chokes - stuttering and spluttering in frustration because she has nothing to say. This is so frustrating. This is an actress who needs words. Yes, she has an interesting face and is very emotive facially and physically, but it is her voice we want to hear.Other actors are similarly wasted or misused. Billy Crudup who was wonderful in Rudderless (highly recommended) is reduced to nothing more than a quasi-romantic, handyman whose function is as a foil for the female actors and to spout occasional New Age nonsense. Greta Gerwig, another interesting actor is strangely muzzled in her role, and Elle Fanning is totally miscast as an angry, vulnerable teen who uses sexual promiscuity to act out against her therapist mother who appears to have no idea what is going on in her daughter's life. She is an actor I really don't get; she has the ability to seem vacant, and empty, and she strangles the life out of every line, using the wrong emphasis on words so that just about everything she says loses all meaning and becomes a monotone. I do not understand her appeal. The actor who played the boy was adequate.The story - plot - whatever is beside the point in this movie. It is more a string of lightly connected reminiscences from a young man's perspective. It starts nowhere and that's about where it ends up. We do get an idea as to the trajectory of these people's lives, and that is interesting. It is a slice of life from a specific point in time. It is interesting to see the fashions and other accouterments of that period in history - I did like that.On a final note - did this kid ever go to school?"

That said, it felt like Mills was counting on setting, performances, and thematic richness to bail out a story lacking in plot. Did they? Yeah...a little. But a little more story and a little less white liberal nostalgia would have been nice."
" Great story about a bunch of people in transition
",0.6249,0.9626,2017-10-27 00:00:00,8,"I was looking forward to watching this movie because I liked Beginners, by the same director and I was not disappointed: this story has a similar understated quirkiness, but it is a bit less melancholic.The whole cast is convincing as a group of lost souls living in Southern California in 1979. Annette Bening is Dorothea, the 55yo single mum of 15yo Jamie. Due to their age gap, she finds it difficult to connect with Jamie. Dorothea asks Julie, a teenage friend of Jamie and Abbie, a lodger in her house, to help her raising Jamie.Their unconventional living arrangement is completed by William, another lodger in Dorothea's house. In his 40s, William could be a much needed father figure for Jamie, but the two do not get along.Increasing tension in the house pushes Jamie to run away with Julie. This in turn leads to a temporary re-connection with Dorothea, but we gather that their relationship was never easy or close and it is only in memory that Jamie finds solace and understanding for his long deceased mother.1979 was a transitional period: the end of whatever was left of the hippie era and the beginning of the yuppies. Punk rock was about to die, but it still seemed in good shape. Unfortunately, that was also period during which were developed some distortions in our society, perceived as ""liberation"". The growth of technology, fast travel, fast fashion etc...which resulted only in increased stress, frustration and chaos.I felt almost nostalgic watching a not too faraway time when people could live life without cell phones and the internet... However, without the internet I would not be here writing reviews... Great story though, and great soundtrack: a lot of Talking Heads' music is featured in the film, which I liked since I am a fan."

But the presentation was so pleasant. The screenplay carefully picked the right events, and the dialogues were good. The book fanatics would go and look for the original source it was adapted from. But the truth is it was an originally written screenplay, and that's why it got a nomination at the recent Oscars. Another way to say, it inspired by the director's own childhood life, being raised by his mother and sister.This is the story of a single mother, whose teenage son is struggling to blend with the world. Then they have two roommates, one a woman in her 20s and a middle aged man. Beside a girl of her son's age visits regularly and sometimes secretly. So how all these people influence in the boy's life is the story that revealed. His mother being from different generation and not understanding the present world, which was the year 1979, where the film sets in.From the director of 'Beginners', yet another unique film. Thematically there's nothing special, though it was carved with the excellent bunch of actors made the difference. I'm not sure the title was perfect for what the film narrated. Yes, if it was Annette Bening's Dorothea's story, then it justifies. But the story does not have one perspective of narration. All the main characters like Bening, Elle, Greta, Crudup and Zumann, shared screen equally. So, instead I would have preferred the title, '20th Century Tale'.Greta kind of reminded me Kristen Stewart with the hair like that. Two hours long drama with some funs. Really a good film. The topics it brings in for discussion were interesting, especially which is in the current era. Films like this should be watching.

So perfect! And Bening...I just love her more every time I see her. How she embodies each role she plays and exudes this new personality for us to see...wonderful stuff!However, the younger generation also embodied wonderful performances -- Elle Fanning, Greta Gerwig, and Lucas Jade Zumann were exquisite!Probably not a guy's film, but just what I needed to see today.

The kid is solid. Gerwig and Crudup do their usual good work. Fanning is stretching out into a more adult role. Writer/director Mike Mills is building a nice resume.

All at once she is progressive and traditional. She is confident yet flaky. Bening portrays this complicated woman with such incredible conviction and poise, and despite the absence of grandstanding emotional outbursts she delivers what I believe to be an Oscar worthy performance. Fanning and Gerwig turn in fantastic performances too, both doing so with subtlety and charm which caused me to feel genuine empathy for their troubled characters. Lucas Jade Zumann puts forth a fine turn also as the sensitive young man who is seeking to find truth in his life and frustrated at his mother's reluctance to do the same.The film moves at mellow but fairly active pace and uses a nice technique involving duel narration from both Bening's character as well as her son. The soundtrack is also worthy of mention too. An excellent mix of songs from the period including two tracks from the Talking Heads - never a bad thing.In all, writer & director Mike Mills manages to draw from his own experiences as a young man an produce an incredibly sweet, heartfelt and sentimental piece of work that really captures this pivotal period of history. Tackling issues such as personal identity, fear of change and what it all means to let go of the past and embrace the future. A very fine film and outstanding performances from all involved!"

Much of the movie features the characters (the mom, her son, his friend, and some tenants) discussing their past, but also focuses on the women's liberation movement. Unlike many movies set in the era, there's no emphasis on the clothes or music of the era. This one is all about the characters' relationships. And rarely have we heard female sexuality discussed this openly in a movie from the US.Mike Mills previously directed ""Beginners"", about an elderly man who comes out as gay to his son. I've liked both his movies so far. Probably the most interesting scene is at the end when the characters discuss their future. It's also good that, despite the spate of terrible things that happened in 2016, there were a number of female-driven movies (20th Century Women, The Boss, Ghostbusters, Bad Moms). I recommend it, and I hope to see more movies like it."

Mills who directed ""Beginners"" about his relationship with his gay father, now turns to women; one specifically being his mom. The film is set in 1979. Annette Benign stars as Dorothea Fields, a free-thinking single mother of a 15-year-old teen named Jamie. Dorothea is having a bit of a rocky time in raising Jamie, so he asks her bohemian punky tenant Abbie and Jamie's childhood female friend Julie to help raise Jamie. So oh oh oh Jamie's crying!! Sorry Van Halen. Actually, Jamie is not crying so much and takes the opportunity to reinvent himself and be more risqué in his choices; so it eventually becomes a Jamie ""coming of age"" experience. Mills' personal touch on his direction and scribe of the film was tender but a few times it did its bit of dragging; but not enough to hurt the film's overall narrative. Bening was sensational as Dorothea. Elle Fanning continues her hot young streak with a crafty performance as Julie. Billy Crudup was solid as Dorothea's male tenant William. But the 20th century woman which was the great thespian queen of the bunch was Greta Gerwig for her standout performance as Abbie. So go and hit on those ""20th Century Women"". **** Good"
" A Postcard to the Baby Boomer Generation that was raised by 20th Century Women
",0.0,0.9982,2017-06-22 00:00:00,6,"The greatest thing about ""20th Century Women"" is the cinematography. The backstories, glimpses of the future, and story progression is sometimes told in a series of poignant short vignettes graced by self- narration from the individual characters of the film. This technique seemingly allows you to peer through the changes in characters over long periods of time without being burdened by the minor details. It is a beautiful film that is well executed. ""20th Century Women"" is a 2016 film that offers a commentary on the baby boomers who grew up in the 1970s in Southern California, some of whom would go on to be responsible for the largest creation of wealth in history.The year at the opening of the film is 1979. The setting is Santa Barbara, California, perhaps one of the most picturesque beach towns on the west coast. Jamie is a 15 year old teenager who grows up in this liberal city; however, he is raised by a divorced single-mother who goes by the dated name of Dorothea. As Jamie narrates to the audience, Dorothea was older than most women when she had Jamie. She was from the Depression era. As a ""20th Century"" woman, Dorothea insisted that Jamie was raised by the ""community"". One member of this community is a girl named Abbie. Dorothea runs a boarding house where the free-spirited Abbie is a tenant. Abbie is an aspiring photographer who has a strained relationship with her own mother for turning her into a ""DES daughter"". DES was a fertility drug that many women used that was later discovered to cause cancer. Abbie learns that despite surviving the cancer that her mother's use of fertility drugs gave her, she will never be able to have children. As this drama progresses, Abbie takes refuge in Dorothea and Jamie. She also helps Jamie navigate his first teenage crush who happens to be his best friend, Julie. Julie also chooses to take on the role of being a part of the community who raises Jamie. When Jamie learns that his mother went to Julie and Abbie for advice on how to raise him, he begins a rebellious streak. Like so many other teenagers of his era, he runs away from home to attend a rock concert. Abbie and Jamie form a brother-sister like relationship. But Julie and Jamie never end up together romantically. This forms one of the major conflicts in the story. Dorothea has her own relationship problems. At its core, Dorothea represents women who pursue the ""safe choice"" in relationships instead of pursuing the people they are attracted to. Julie, on the other hand, pursues only the men she is attracted to and feels that a physical attraction is different from an emotional attraction. Jamie eventually confides in Julie that he loves her. But Julie says she cares too much about him as a friend to have sex. Julie is a witness to the women's liberation movement. She even participates. During one scene, she tells the story of her first sexual encounter using ""spit"" as a lubricant during a deeply awkward and inappropriate dinner conversation with Jamie and Dorothea. Julie and Jamie eventually grow apart. But Dorothea eventually benefits from the same movement and finds the courage to approach William, the man she is attracted to. At the beginning of the film, he is promiscuous and narrates aloud, ""Women didn't have to look one way or another or be a certain way. I think that I just, I want to win them over so that I won't be lonely. But once I have them, I don't really know what to do with them"". Dorothea changes that. The story of ""20th Century Women"" culminates with Dorothea finally accepting the generational gap between her and her son. She can never truly connect with Jamie the way she wants to. The community can no longer raise people's children. But that doesn't mean Jamie and Dorothea don't have a good relationship. The film could have been better if it weren't for the abrupt ending. After building the relationships of the characters so well, the film ends with the main characters describing the rest of their own lives using voice-overs. To a 21st century baby, how does one explain the charisma of a ""20th Century Woman"" like Dorothea? Future women will be more like Julie and will benefit from the sexual liberation movement that the baby boomers advanced. In one touching scene, Julie confidently discusses her own sexuality to Jamie by explaining her attraction to men, ""Their bodiescause you don't exactly know what they are going to look like or smell or feel like until you do it. But yeah, half the time I regret it"" she says candidly. ""Then why do you it?"" Jamie inquires. ""Because half the time I don't regret it,""."
" The Education
",0.0,0.9909,2017-06-05 00:00:00,7,"The most significant aspect about this movie is that the main character (the kid) is in the middle of the story but also is not. It is more about the influence of other people on him then growing up. His education in different ways is the most interesting idea of the writers. Both Elle Fanning and Greta Gerwig are well written characters and add an new layer to the movie (esp. in the middle part and towards the end). Annette Bening as mother is also well performed and illustrates a contrast to the other two women although she is also busy with raising her child.The movie has a nice atmosphere, good dialogue (esp. when talking about the life) and convinces with mostly interesting characters and an all in all worthwhile story.In contrary the movie is quite wordy in the first part and the story is well written but sometimes to monotonous. I also think that they could've gone more in debt with the character development esp. of the kid's character.So should you see it? Yes! If you want to watch a soft drama about life and growing up you won't be disappointed. With some vivid scenes and the life itself as an overall topic the movie masters to create an optimistic atmosphere. If this isn't your style you should probably leave this one out."
" a semi-autobiographical treatment thrives for encapsulating the zeitgeist of its time
",0.0,0.9672,2017-05-20 00:00:00,7,"American filmmaker Mike Mills' third feature film, 20th CENTURY WOMEN is a semi- autobiographical treatment thrives for encapsulating the zeitgeist of its time through the eyes of his alter ego Jamie (Zumann), a 15-year-older living in Santa Barbara in 1979, and those who are involved in his life at that stage, including his single mother Dorothea (Bening), Julie (Fanning), the girl-next-door he cottons to, and two tenants sharing the same roof with the mother-son pair: a free-wheeling cinematographer Abbie (Gerwig) and William (Crudup), an ex-hippie-turned- mechanic, that's the central quintet.Each character is given a magnanimous character arc to lay bare their problems and quirks, Dorothea is concerned with the communication blockage caused when Jamie reaching adolescence and asks both Julie and Abbie for help, to infuse their feminine wisdom to ease the process, but the mirror has two faces, in Jamie's book, it is her who has drifted away from him, emotionally speaking, her ingrained sadness and loneliness has hog-tied her from even attempting to seek a new lease on her life. Bening puts a defiant face to sort out a mother's indefatigable stamina conjoined with hapless frustration, whenever the camera leveling at her, she radiates with élan and candid, no matter how platitudinous her lines are, her masterclass delivery is the ballast of this snappy but also self-indulging reflection of an ineffectual Bidungsroman, interlaced with lengthy voice-over and token signs-of-the-times. As a patent feminist manifesto indicated by its name, Mills makes heavy plays of its female characters, Abbie, stricken by cervical cancer and runs the risk of forfeiting motherhood, is the most sympathetic character and a ginger Gerwig is perfectly cast, she is tasked with the ""menstruation"" oration, because of her time-tested screen persona: she can be radical, quirky, but simultaneously vulnerable and self-effacing, a quality so unique that often errs on the side of being typecast. Elle Fanning's Julie, on the other hand, tiptoes between adolescence and adulthood, dangles Jamie with her dalliance with others yet maintains a chaste relationship with him (he has been entrapped in the friends zone for too long), but that's what is part and parcel to be an impressionable young girl, especially a pretty one and those equally impressionable young boys need to respect that! From that viewpoint, we might find the film tends to be a tad didactic and patronizing since the story chiefly sets the main key on the more conventional ""the kid is alright"" arc of a cisgender boy, who has grown up in a household peopled with women who are much more interesting than him, even the undervalued William, who is not exactly a conventional father figure, but Crudup is in one of his most relaxed and unassuming forms, somewhat inward-looking but alternately exuberantly charming. While one might feel underwhelmed by its self-referential narrative and jarring by its often clunky dialogue, at the very least, the film has a congenial flair of communion among its main characters, and from the opening aerial shot introducing its locale to its eye-soothing vintage production, to the time-lapsed novelty of automobiles in motion, 20TH CENTURY WOMEN proves that it has enough ammo in the cartridge, but the shooter himself is not a dead-eye."

It follows three principal female characters and charts the influence they have on our teenage protagonist. Annette Bening is the freewheeling mom, doing the best she can without someone to provide a positive male influence for her son. Greta Gerwig is the boarder who teaches him about girls and music. And Elle Fanning is his female friend who refuses to be his girlfriend. The conclusion he and the movie comes to seems to be that women are necessary but confusing. I found myself irritated by all of them. They spend all of their time trying to teach him what and how to think without ever letting him develop an identity of his own.The film is entertaining enough, but there is something lacking, and I'm not surprised that it wasn't one of the stand out movies of the year. I love Bening and would watch her in anything, and she does as much as she probably can with her character, but one can't help but wonder how much better a performance she could have given with better writing and directing at her back.Grade: B"

Even President Carter is uncertain about the times. America is moving on to a new decade and indeed soon to a new president. With these changing times the characters are concerned what music and dance are considered cool or not.This is a well acted ensemble piece with the just right amount of kookiness. Look out for the awkward discussion about periods during a dinner party scene.The narrative moves ahead of time as the adult Jamie reflects back as to what happened to some of the characters, all that smoking Dorothea does will have an impact on her health some years for now.The film is rather uneven and I felt oddly paced, the running time is too long and there is little plot in it."

" Girlhood.
",0.0,0.9869,2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"What appears to be a coming of age feminist film, turns out to be a wonderfully honest portrayal of multi-faceted relationships in a tumultuous time. When is time not tumultuous? Exactly. It's the late seventies, the soundtrack is punk, America has a wonderful president (although they don't know it) in Jimmy Carter, and the hippie aesthetic of the sixties is being put to the test.As mother hen Dorothea, Annette Bening is wonderful in a complex role that requires strength, vulnerability and passion. Single mother to her teenage son, Dorothea asks her artsy boarder, and Jamie's platonic girl friend, to help raise the boy.What could have easily spiraled into a mushy, messy, melodrama, is instead a visceral slice of life, where crap happens, folks react, drama ensues, some resolution is found, some is not. And amid all the drama, there are bits of clever humour sprinkled in for levity. There is no clear, point to point plot trail here, just an extended family dealing with life as it unfolds.The performances are exceptional across the board, with Bening a likely Oscar candidate. Superb."
" weird, complicated, beautiful as life
",0.4939,0.9956,2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"The most unusual and violent scene in director Mike Mills' 20th Century Women is the opening scene. A car suddenly bursts in flames in the parking of a supermarket. The year is 1979. Is this a violent act (not unusual for a period when racial and political clashes often turned so) or some mafia coup? It turns that it's just an old car overheating. That's the most extreme scene, the rest, even some fist-fight between teenagers, is just life. Real life, brought to screen with talent and emotion in one of the best films I have seen lately.It could be the story of the coming to age of a 15 years boy with a rather intrusive and dominant single mother. It could be a film about a period of confusion in history, or better said the beginning of many consecutive periods of confusion, when values were eroding and the old generation of leaders were having too many doubts to be able to continue to lead. It may be the story of a single mother, born after WWI, raised during the Big Depression, who dreamed to become a fight pilot but WWII ended to early for her to fulfill this dream, who fell in love, gave birth to a child, got divorced, and raises her child as well as she understands, in the friendly and tolerant atmosphere of California ten years after the Flower Power era. It may be the story of three women at three different ages of their lives coping with loneliness and failed relations. It may be all these and more.The characters in 20th Century Women are weird because they are true. They are actually weird as in real life, weird as each one of us is. Fabulous acting helps to make these characters live persons which remain with you as viewer long after the screening ends. Annette Bening as the aging mother gives a performance which reminded me some of Meryl Streep's finest. Elle Fanning acts literally since she was a toddler, and grows into becoming a formidable actress – this may be the role we shall remember years later of her as a growing and mature teens (but are not teen girls more mature than teen boys as a rule?). Greta Gerwig is a real revelation, she enters her messy character and makes it true. Lucas Jade Zumann succeeds to be real, complex, and likable – with him Hollywood has a new teenager idol, I hope it will not break but rather lunch his career. I do not know where director Mike Mills hid until now, but before I applaud his work I would like to praise script author Mike Mills who wrote a story that lives on screen, moves the viewers and brings back the time when things started to go wrong but the emotions and kindness of the people prevailed which is always a reason to hope. The only objection I would have is related to the exaggerated use of quotes, this may have tried to convey a feeling of what the characters were reading and were influenced by, this seemed a little precious and verbose – too little shade however for a shining film experience."
" All Movie Families Are Dysfunctional
",0.0,0.9964,2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"Let's start by getting the plot of 20TH CENTURY WOMEN out there. Dorothea (Annette Benning) is a single mother in 1979 California, a free spirit left from the sixties raising Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann) in a large house where she rents out rooms. Jamie has reached the age of 15, that time in life when young boys become young men, and Dorothea isn't quite sure how to handle the change. To help she enlists the aid of those living under the same roof.Julie (Elle Fanning) is about the same age as Jamie. She creeps into his room at night to sleep with him but never to have sex, preferring to be his friend instead. This doesn't stop her with sleeping with most of the other boys she meets nor from Jamie having a huge crush on her. Julie's mother is a therapist who drags Julie to every group therapy session she gives which does more damage than help in Julie's case.Abbie (Great Gerwig) is a photo-journalist, cervical cancer survivor and late adolescent of the seventies, into punk rock in a big way, colored hair and all. Like Dorothea she is a free spirit as well but more mature than most in the house. Jamie shares a love of punk rock with her, a theme that plays out throughout the film.William (Billy Crudup) is a handy man living in the house, doing an extreme restoration on the house in return for a roof over his head. William is another holdover from the sixties who discovers himself in the arms of most women he meets but finds no comfort there. Not recruited for the mission of helping raise Jamie at first, the two have little in common, he does end up helping.With all of that set in place as the movie progresses you begin to realize that perhaps Jamie isn't the one who needs raising among this group. Or perhaps all of them need to be raised. Dorothea, eager to take on help in trying to form this young man into an adult, soon finds that she's not quite comfortable with the directions each may be taking in their aid. But isn't that part of discovering your child growing up? At the same time she begins rediscovering herself at the same time.So is this a good movie or a bad movie? That will all depend on several things. Let me start by saying this movie has art film written all over it. It is given to long patches of dialogue and narration followed by pensive looks between characters. In reality no one talks or reacts this way. And few families are as dysfunctional as we see here. But that's true of nearly every movie family ever filmed in the last few decades. All are emotional messes attempting to find solutions. Without being depicted that way my guess is film makers feel they would be doing little more than putting mundane glimpses of daily life on screen which could make a boring film.I will be honest and note that during the first 40 minutes of this film I found myself checking the time marker about every 8 minutes to see just how much longer I would have to endure this film. But then things started to change. It wasn't just that it took a while to depict who each character was so much as it was that heavy handed art film atmosphere it took on immediately. I for one find it tedious to watch scenes put together without apparent rhyme or reason that go nowhere. But then something happened.While I at first could care less about any and all of the characters I found myself growing to like these people, to feel concern. I wanted to carry on forward and see what happened. I wanted to know if they would be able to move this young teenager forward or not. At the same time I wondered if they would be able to discover that they were suffering from their own problems with maturity as well, if they would realize that they needed to move forward in life at the same time. Would all of them be able to survive the unintended experiment Dorothea had laid out for them when the film began? The movie is well made technically. The acting for the most part is extremely subtle, especially that from Crudup and Gerwig. Benning comes off as the oddest of characters here with the most use of those pensive stares I commented on earlier and often replying to situations or dialogue with a single word, ""Well"".In the end I would say that I enjoyed the film and was glad I watched it. Some will, some won't. If you decide to watch it give it a chance though. Don't start and then give up immediately. Don't watch it while doing laundry or making dinner or drifting in and out. Sit down and watch it start to finish. Then reflect back on your own journey through life. After all, aren't we all just a tad dysfunctional at times?"

Many people choose films by which actors are in it, Directors, genre or trailers but I'm getting into the habit of Who's investing it in?Both A24 & Anna Purna are two of many independent companies that are making interesting, fresh and investments in sometimes off beat projects.Sone of these will be hits for you, some not. But it feels like the investments are less about making tons of money (although that's nice) and more about doing good work.That's where I stand on 20th Century Womaen - its good work. And not in the faint praise kind of way. Its solid, thoughtful, genuine and captures the zeitgeist of its time and memories. Would I recommend it to everyone? No, but I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to let it be what it is.To me the title seems a mis-nomer and maybe an anachronism but the writing, direction, acting and editing all seem in step. I pretty much liked each performance and appreciated how each was a true character and a metaphor for modern day ""strum un drang"". It is what it is and a metaphor.Take the opening scene where the mother and son are at the market only to discover their car has exploded into flames with smoke and fire billowing from the wreckage. If you don't see that as a symbolic message, you're not paying attention. I also really liked how the charter responses and reactions were atypical and broken the Hollywood conventions. When Dorethea's 15 year old son takes off on a whim on a trip up the coast of California without telling her she is understandably upset and concerned but her reaction isn't anger and punishment but to simply find relief in re-connecting with him happy he is fine.Of course the biggest underlying theme - how does a mother raise a boy to be a man? - brings about a clever and unique solution that doesn't come across as schmaltzy, gimmicky or disingenuous. The way that men and male figures swirl around the periphery highlights Dorothea's own struggle in raising her son without a father figure and her lack of clarity on "" manliness"". The same is true of the other female characters who each seem to struggle with their relationship to ""the other"" (eg: men) yet each seems to find a way through, come to terms and end up ""ok"" with who they are and where they are.Elle Fanning's character of Julie has an odd yet honest and unique relationship with the son Jamie (Lucas Zumann) in that she comes to sneak in to his room to be friends and sleep together but never have sex. Yet outside that relationship she sleeps around but is otherwise responsible. Seems odd but so is each of us - not to ourselves but to others.Yes, this movie moves slowly because it develops organically and has a strong naturalistic feel to it but I was never bored and frequently captivated. The editing and special effects were purposeful and helped me to feel there was a balance between their inner and outer lives.For me a couple of the standards for a good film are: Is it memorable? And will I watch it again? For 20th C Women (despite the title) the answers are yes."

He not only has a protective, chain-smoking single mother, Dorothea (played by Annette Bening), but she recruits his girl friend, one word, not two (Elle Fanning) and her boarder (Greta Gerwig) to help look out for him, to teach him ""how to be a good man."" Three moms could be a bit much, and is, but he is graceful under pressure, even when Gerwig inducts him into feminist thinking with Our Bodies, Our Selves. The resident handyman (Billy Crudup) could be a decent masculine role model, but he and Jamie just don't connect. The movie has a lot of cultural references to the 70s that may make you laugh or shake your head. A group of Dorothea's friends sit around to listen to Jimmy Carter's preachy bummer of a speech about the ""crisis of confidence"" among Americans and the need to get past rampant consumerism. This impolitic speech was reviled at the time (one of the characters says, ""He is so f-----"")—and now sounds distressingly prescient.

" 1979 coming of age narrative features endearing characters but a plot that wears out its welcome
",0.6124,-0.9451,2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Director Mike Mills is back after six years with another sensitive exploration of family life, following the 2010 release of Beginners, a fictionalized story of his father who came out of the closet past the age of seventy. Here Mills tackles a coming of age tale set in Santa Barbara, California, circa 1979.Mills' strong suit is his characters, all of whom exude a heady verisimilitude. The main focus is on the relationship between a divorced mother, Dorothea (Annette Benning) and her teenage son, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann). Dorothea has two boarders in her home: the 20ish photographer Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and aging hippie carpenter William (Billy Crudup). Also in the mix is teenager Julie (Elle Fanning) who develops a platonic friendship with Jamie, and often sleeps over in Jamie's bedroom without his mother's knowledge.Throughout the film, Mills provides a back story for each of the protagonists in a series of flashbacks, narrated in voice-overs by one of their principal counterparts (Dorothea's back story is narrated by Jamie, for example). He intersperses documentary footage and still images that correspond to the era in which each character grew up in. Titles of prominent books from the 70s also manage to find their way into the narrative as bookmarks of sorts, coupled with a soundtrack that features a combination of an ethereal-sounding theme along with late 70s punk music.Each character has a distinctive history--whether it's the chain-smoking Dorothea, troubled by her lack of a relationship with a man; the equally troubled Jamie, pining away for Julie, who won't reciprocate his desire to become intimate, and fears that she's been impregnated by a teenager who's simply used her for sex; Abbie, dealing with a diagnosis of cervical cancer; and William, once a member of a hippie commune and unable to break his habit of desiring casual sex with women.For a while, Mills' plot keeps one's interest. There's Jamie's rebellion against his mother which leads to reckless behavior—at one point, the rebellious teenager almost is asphyxiated while playing a deadly choking game with a group of other reckless teenagers. Abbie finds out that her cancer isn't fatal and also gets what turns out to be a false diagnosis that she won't be able to have children anymore. She also propositions William and they sleep together.At a certain point (perhaps 90 minutes into the film), Dorothea reveals in a voice-over that she'll die of cancer in 1999. We're expecting Mills to wrap things up at this point but no, he drags his story out to almost an unnecessary two hours in length. The problem is that there's little variation or suspense in resolving the problem in Dorothea and Jamie's relationship. Early on Dorothea tells Jamie, ""we've got to talk,"" and Jamie replies, ""whatever."" It seems we hear the same thing at the end of the film which suggests there's little new to learn about the ongoing mother-son conflict. Mills introduces a long-winded dinner table scene in which Abbie castigates those in attendance for being embarrassed talking about ""menstruation."" Later, Dorothea tells Abbie she's been a bad influence on Jamie, pointing him in the wrong direction with her new-found feminist interests.Finally, the big ""resolve"" is hardly a bang and much more of a whimper. Jamie and Julie drive up the coast and settle in a cabin where Jamie's ""nice guy"" routine fails for the last time to entice Julie into bed. When he disappears, Julie frantically calls Dorothea, who drives up with Abbie and William, to find the errant son. But when they get there, Jamie has suddenly returned and the air feels like it's totally dissipated from the proverbial balloon.The fate of the principals, so emotionally descriptive, is perhaps the best part of the film. The narration informs what happens to all the protagonists, with Dorothea finding happiness with a new man in her life and Jamie eventually reaching adulthood and fathering a child.20th Century Women features good acting all-around, with Annette Benning aptly conveying the confusion of a mother whose teenage son displays stirrings of desire to leave the nest. Mills' characters are endearing but his episodic description of what happens to them eventually wears out its welcome. This is a film that could have been almost half an hour shorter and somehow Mills needed to think harder about how to build suspense and bring his 20th Century Women to a more satisfying conclusion."

Life for 15 year old Jamie was different than it was from me. I had two parents, but I didn't have a skateboard.Yes, I can remember Jimmy Carter being president. But I didn't see his impressive and remarkably modern 'Crisis of Confidence'-speech, which is an important feature in one of the scenes of this film. There's only one thing which caused somewhat nostalgic emotions: making mix tapes. Yes, I did that too.'20th Century Women', which is essentially about a mother raising a son, has nice scenes. I really liked the explanation about punk rock music to the 55 year old mother: she complains about the lack of beauty, but exactly that is the strength of it. There are many such scenes, with small but meaningful events, telling a lot about how life was in the seventies.But the story itself didn't captivate me. Jamie's mother thinks she can't raise Jamie on her own, so she involves his best friend (a girl) and a photographer who rents a room in the house (also a girl). They teach him lots of things about sex, music, seducing women, and life in general. All characters are in a way in search of there own destiny. So, a lot of soul searching is going on. Anyway, the film contains one of the best one-liners I've heard in years: 'Wondering if you're happy is a great shortcut to just being depressed'."

It also reminds you what a treasure Annette Bening is, and how easily she can create truthful, real yet conflicted female characters on the screen. The increasingly impressive Elle Fanning and Greta Gerwig are also great. The icing on the cake is Billy Crudup, who always seems to make interesting choices which serve the story rather than his ego as an actor.I loved taking the trip back to the 70s, listening to Talking Heads, imagining how exciting New York must have been around then. I loved the detail of the interconnected stories and hints at how complicated being a woman can be.

This was an excellent semi autobiography but not necessarily an excellent film . It meandered too much and at one stage could have been 9/10 but in many other parts it was 6/10 . When it was good it was really good eg the speech by President Carter , but when it was mediocre it lingered too much making it inconsistent from an entertainment point of view . It was billed as a comedy and there were some comic moments but they were seldom. What really made the film was Abbie played by Greta Gerwig she was the glue that kept all the characters together , she was Jamie's muse and her story was THE story . From near tragedy to triumph whilst being the character most in touch with the others apart from Elle Fanning's character who she saw too much of herself in. For me I could see so many similarities to my own life that it became very personal and the soundtrack was amazing - 1979 was MY year of music . I enjoyed the film , I'm glad I saw it , it could have been better , but it was good enough as it was for an enjoyable slice of entertainment."

",0.8316,0.9942,2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Writer/director Mike Mills has a keen eye for all the nuances of idiosyncrasies the represent full character development. He has been nominated for his major films including an Oscar nomination for 20TH CNETURY WOMEN and other nominations and awards for BEGINNERS and THUMBSUCKER. The man has a gift for comedic writing that also carries a punch. His ability to allow his actors to absorb his characters and then appear to be simply having conversations is a true tribute to a fine director. The 1970s was a strange decade, a time when in response to the public sentiment to the Vietnam War turned concepts of introspection and playing out of emotions regarding sexual freedom, drugs, parenting, single mothers in a time when many husbands failed to survive the war, the free living style of running away from home to try a 'new life' at the expense of others – all of this an more created the hippies and many other aspects of the zeitgeist that Mike Mills captures so well.Love, life and the struggles of a mother (Annette Bening, brilliant as always) bringing up a son Jamie (first Vitaly A Lebeau then the more mature form in Lucas Jade Zumann – a spectacularly talented new actor) in the early 70's. The ignorance of a free spirit (Benning) against the needs of a young man (Zumann) trying to find his true character and beliefs. Living in a bohemian household shared with 3 like-minded spirited people to help pay the rent (Julie – Elle Fanning, Abbie – Greta Gerwig, and handy man William – Billy Crudup) his mother tries to establish bonds that he cannot deal with. She cannot deal with his inability to talk and enlists the help of other females in his life to share the burden of his upbringing. Slowly life unravels for them all without understanding how. In spite of their perceived struggles, they all go on to live defined lives without any serious consequences. The film is peppered with excellent 'discussions' about sex, drugs, current music, considering the future (or not), and parenting and it all results is a wonderful mishmash of intersecting lives trying to figure out the meaning of being here in the universe. Annette Bening is absolutely brilliant and the supporting cast is consistently excellent. This is a film that slipped by audiences and hopefully will enjoy a full life as a DVD or on television re-runs."
" More Anecdotes Than Overall Story, But Still Very Interesting
",0.611,0.9869,2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"During this film, one of the main characters receives a book on feminism that he proceeds to dissect chapter by chapter. I feel like that is a very good metaphor for what ""20th Century Women"" is like, too...more a collection of loosely-related stories then a solidified whole.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), a boy being raised by single mother Dorothea (Annette Bening) who wonders ""if you need a man to raise a man?"". In hopes of giving Jamie more perspective on life, Dorothea enlists the help of his contemporaries, crush Julie (Elle Fanning) and hard-core feminist Abbie (Greta Gerwig), to help guide him through adolescence.At its core, ""20th Century Women"" is an admirable film. I can easily see what the filmmakers were ""going for"" in terms of themes. If certain parts make you feel uncomfortable (like a scene teaching people to be comfortable saying the word ""menstruation""), that's the goal. I can very much appreciate filmmaking of this caliber, as I am always looking for a good ""thinking piece"" sort of film. I like to be challenged, and this does that in spades.The problem with the movie, however, is that it doesn't really feel like much of a connected whole. As I said, it is more a collection of interesting anecdotes/acts than anything cohesive. Almost the anti-""Boyhood"", in a sense (that movie was just one long narrative). As such, it is difficult to judge what ""20th Century Women"" is really supposed to be about in terms of overall plot.So, my final take on this film is that while I appreciate its frank discussion on many controversial issues (takes that made me question my own beliefs), I can't really rank it much higher than these seven stars due to its issues with cohesiveness."
" A warm funny coming-of-age story that asks ""do you need a man to raise a man?""
",0.5859,0.9989,2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"The coming-of-age genre looks at turning points like sexual awakening, maturing identity, and rites of adulthood. Often gender stereotyped, they tend to use a retro-nostalgic lens because we feel safer looking back. The film 20th Century Women (2016) follows these genre cues but in its own way breaks out of the usual gender boxes with a narrative that pivots on a few words delivered innocently: ""Don't you need a man to raise a man?"".It is 1979 in free-spirited California where 55 year-old divorcée Dorothea (Annette Bening) feels inadequate in raising her loner 15 year-old son Jamie (Lucas Zumann). She enlists the support of boarder Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and Jamie's best friend Julie (Elle Fanning) by asking them to talk to him about the kind of things a teenage boy cannot talk about with a mother. The three women are intelligent, open communicators and Jamie is immersed in a feminised world-view, with a post- hippy handyman friend providing a token male presence.What follows is more like a rich montage of charming moments than significant narrative developments. Jamie is taken to cool music places, has long private chats with Abbie and Julie, is given feminist literature to soften his emerging masculinity, and is sensitised to the sexual ethics that will shape his future relationships. Among other things, he learns about loving the whole woman not just her sexual parts; the physiology of female orgasm; and the value of platonic friendship. As a period piece, it richly evokes the fashion, music, and customs of a time that many audiences will view through rose-coloured glass: a simpler, safer, and more truthful time.Greta Gerwig and Elle Fanning are cast perfectly as embodiments of the growing girl-power of the era. But the acting dynamics are driven entirely by Annette Bening and Lucas Zumann. While the story may be about Jamie's entry to manhood, it is told through Dorothea's eyes. Benning convincingly portrays the full emotional gamut of the single mother of a teenage boy: overwhelming love; confusion; anxiety; and struggling for, while steadily losing, parental authority. Zumann is wonderful in his role, balancing premature worldly wisdom, innocence and youthful passion for life. The film's plot is as laidback as the era it depicts, but the characterisation and performances have depth and sincerity.This film challenges the popular wisdom that a boy needs a father to make him a man. Jamie's emerging masculinity is femo-centric, emotionally sensitive, open and responsive. In one sense, this coming-of-age story is as stereotyped as any other because of the way it portrays tension between gender differences. But it inverts the usual 'boys are active agents/girls are passive victims' binary. In a world where traditional definitions of family are under constant debate and renewal, this film adds another viewpoint on how to teach young males to respect females. While it is an entertaining and engaging comedy-drama, it also asks serious questions about how is it that in the 21st century we still raise men who commit violence against women."
" Underrated, uplifting, harmless and revivalist
",0.25,0.8381,2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Underrated, uplifting, harmless and revivalist, Women is a film that somehow slipped under the radar not quite getting the attention it undeniably deserves. Mills's prowess here to manage to make a completely uneventful story feel convoluted, nuanced and relevant. 20th Century Women is carried heavily on the shoulders of its actors, impeccably led by the always spotless Bening, rising Fanning and omnipresent Gerwig. Paradoxically though Mills doesn't manage to aptly translate to the screen his own sharp and charming script; as whole the film works - and gets its message across (even if it doesn't have to) - but as we're sitting through the film, it feels slightly rusty and slow, almost craving for a bump or a twist. The staleness is harmless though as the characters' likability is palpable and the charm overabundant, rendering those small flaws feel non-existent in hindsight."

Basically set during the summer of 1979 in Santa Barbara, Southern California, it the story of three women exploring love and freedom, and the 20th century world changing around them. Dorothea Fields (Golden Globe nominated Annette Bening) is a single mother and landlord of a boardinghouse, she is concerned about her teenage son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann). Therefore Dorothea enlists the help of the two women closest to her, Jamie's best friend Julie Hamlin (Elle Fanning) and her tenant, quirky punk photographer Abigail ""Abbie"" Porter (Greta Gerwig). With their help they guide Jamie through in whatever they can, while also exploring their own interests and temptations in life, whether for love or career. Dorothea herself also finds a growing relationship with mellow handyman William (Billy Crudup), who becomes another role model to Jamie. The connections between the mother, her adolescent son, his provocative neighbour and friend, and the free-spirited artist boarder are all fragile in ways, but through the culture and social changes going on serve to bring them closer together. Also starring Vitaly Andrew LeBeau as Young Jamie, Alia Shawkat as Trish, Alison Elliott as Julie's Mother and Thea Gill as Abbie's Mother. Bening is a hoot as the erratic mother, Fanning is good as the savvy teenage friend, Gerwig gets many great scenes as the interesting lodger, Zumann does well as the rebellious teenage son, and Crudup is a likable mechanic friend. The characters are what really make this film work, the relationships between them and their exploits make interesting viewing, there are the right amount of funny moments as well, including the memorable discussion of the word ""menstration"", it is also very clever in its use of future narration from the characters about their own circumstances and the historical events happening at the time, it is written fantastically well, no wonder it got nominations for the script, overall it is a splendid alternative coming-of-age comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!"

It's a slice of golden nostalgia that's pretty damn irresistible.There's no plot or resolutions in any generic sense. It's a small part of a remembered  section from someone's past, its characters and setting a search for some understanding of where the changes in life began to take shape.If all this seems a bit too rosy, it probably is, but in a way that's earnest and real. It's not so much nostalgia for its own sake as it is an understanding of how the small moments and the people inside them shape a life, if even subtly. In that sense this film is indeed rosy but not unnecessarily so.The menstruation scene around the dinner table with Greta Gerwig is comic gold."

Set during the under social change 1970s in sun-dappled Souther California, the film perfectly captures the era's aura of transcendence, adaptation and radicalization of the sociopolitical climes as well as one sweet moment in contemplation of punk and new wave meeting like chocolate and peanut butter. Excellent acting, a novella-like storyline and gently handled yet strongly enable direction mark for a gem of a film."
" 70's Centred Women
",0.0,0.9987,2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Mike Mills's second feature film is in a reverse sense the twin sister of Barry Jenkins's ""Moonlight"" (I let you decide which one is the evil one), as both films deal with a troubled relationship between a mother and a son. In ""Moonlight"" however, the mother is all too absent while in ""20th Century Women"" Annett Bening's Dorothea desperately tries to remain present in her son Jamie's (Lucas Jade Zumann) life. The main plot revolves around her idea to instruct his best friend Julie (Elle Fanning) who is only two years older and their roommate Abby (Greta Gerwig) to help her raise him. Due to their respective age (55. 24 and 17), these three women are supposed to represent the past century, however all of them mainly represent the year 1979, the year the film is set in. In the course of two hours the screen is overflooded with audiovisual markers of this particular time period from commune-like gatherings in Dorothy's house to constant smoking, from a punk rock soundtrack to old-fashioned skateboards, from a postcard California-dreamy Santa Barbara to the emergence of feminist thinking, which is indeed very cleverly incorporated through original writings of leading thinkers. The way feminism and female sexuality is presented recalls Mad Men's style of retro commentary which makes society's views on women seem out-dated and overcome until you realise they unfortunately are not. All of this is loosely held together by the story described above that is constantly accompanied by an almost distracting nostalgia buzz which is clearly due to the director's emotional attachment to that era. Given that this is a highly autobiographical work, this is excusable. But it remains a problem nevertheless. Still, on an audiovisual level the film is undoubtedly engaging, since the bright colours and the turbulent soundtrack create a very vivid atmosphere. Even the quite contained plot would not necessarily be a problem, if the script was a little sharper. There are definitely a variety of interesting lines about life, death, sex and friendship in there, but they never form a coherent bigger picture.. If the nostalgia is the film's heart, then the performances are its pulse. The cast definitely fill the scenes with life in a compelling manner while you just wish that they could demonstrate their emotional repertoire a bit more. The three lead actresses all have quite clear-cut positions in the narrative, so that they don't get many chances to truly explore their characters. But in every second they are on screen, they prove once again just how completely in control of their craft they are. Annett Benning has been rightfully praised a lot. She delivers a brilliant portrayal of a free-spirited woman and a deeply caring mother who has to come to terms with the development of her teenage son. Her inner turmoil between staying true to her central values as freedom and self-determination versus still managing to keep track of what her son is up to as well as her bewilderment at cultural signs of the current times (that are a-changing) are played out with nuance and precision.As for the women constituting the other two corners of the generational triangle, there is on the one hand Greta Gerwig who plays a Greta Gerwig-character like no one else could. Abby is surrounded by a severe tragedy though as she has survived cancer due to which she is probably not able to have kids. On the other hand, Elle Fanning proves once and for all that she is not only already an incredibly versatile actress, but that it would not be in the least surprising if she is one of the A-level stars to come. With her absolutely flawless run of films like ""Trumbo"", ""The Neon Demon"" and now her dazzling performance in ""20th Century Women"" as the slightly profligate but somehow still profoundly innocent and ultimately just lost teenager Julie, one is quick to draw a comparison to the young Kirsten Dunst in ""The Virgin Suicides"" who also managed to bring a conflicted aura of dangerous despair hidden under pure beauty to the screen. We can be very excited about what the two of them will create together in Sofia Coppola's next film ""The Beguiled"".Where Mike Mills's script, as charming as it is, lacks some edge and focus, his directing is compelling and full of interesting ideas. Letting all the main characters share the voice-over narration is an effective move, the camera-work is steady and precise (in contrast for example to the sometimes overtly dramatic and shaky framing of ""Moonlight"") and shots that could be simple depictions of moving cars become thrilling rides due to a unique choice of ""Stargate Sequence""-like beams of colour blurring on a screen making the film regularly look like an old VHS recording when perceived on an acid trip which is (intentionally or not) a very fitting effect within the 1970's context. Despite its flaws, 20th Women is definitely worth seeing, since it ultimately makes up two enjoyable hours with great performances which however hint at the potential of a slightly deeper film this could have been if it had aspired to move a bit beyond the mere homage to a time period. Still, I give it seven stars, but I have to admit, Annett Bening, Greta Gerwig and Elle Fanning could probably be shown baking banana bread for three hours and I would be intrigued."

",0.5994,0.9844,2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"This is a very good film. For a change, extensive use of voice-over is justified by its clever counterpoint with what we see on the screen. And what we see is a fine ensemble of actors making the most of an observant, intelligent, compassionate script by writer/director Mike Mills.His work pays tribute to his mother and the women of his mother's generation, who were brought up in the Great Depression, suddenly given huge opportunities when their men went off to fight in World War 2, and then had the strange experience of having those doors close on them when the fighting was over. How do they react to the generation of women below them, who want to reclaim those opportunities, and have analysed how they need to go about doing so.Annette Bening, in one of her quietest but strongest performances, brings tremendous warmth to the leading role, with solid support from young Lucas Jade Zumann as her son. Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup and Elle Fanning complete the main character list with understated, unshowy, completely convincing performances.I loved it."

Then a few years ago she made a comeback of sorts in ""The Kids are All Right"" and I started to get stirrings all over again but then I didn't want to break up what she had with Julianne Moore. But now she's back and it would seem she's up for grabs and I'm head over heels all over again.The movie, of course, is ""20th Century Women"" and the Academy are absolutely bonkers; they've completely ignored last year's best performance by an actress.

'20th Century Women' Synopsis: Dorothea (Annette Benning) seeks the help of Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and Julie (Elle Fanning) to raise her son, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann). '20th Century Women' is about relationships, primarily of a mother and son. Mills delivers a personal story with genuine feeling. I loved the other dynamics as well. The characters of Abbie & Julie are strong as well. You watch 3 women in different age groups, help a boy know a little more about life. They speak differently, their relations to the boy are vastly diverse, but they're women, who define feminism & the practicalities of life. Mills keeps the narrative heartfelt & by the time this story ends, you're with the characters & you feel for them. Mills' Screenplay, which has earned him a Very-Worthy Oscar- Nomnation, is superior. The Writing is super-strong at all times. I don't recall a single moment when the film lost me, I was with the film throughout. Mills' Direction is simple, but well-done. Cinematography & Editing are super. Roger Neill's Score is perfect.'20th Century Women' is embellished with maddening performances. Annette Benning steals the show & how! Her portrayal of a mother trying to her raise her son without a father, is beyond marvelous. Its hard to keep eyes off the screen when Benning is up. Benning has delivered several memorable performances in her fabulous career, but in '20th Century Women', she surpasses herself. And to the Academy, what in the world made you not nominate her? If this isn't acting of the highest order, then what is? Following Benning, are Elle Fanning, Greta Gerwig, Lucas Jade Zumann and Billy Crudup. Fanning is a treasure. She delivers a restrained, believable performance from start to end. Grewig, a criminally underrated performer, is only getting better with every film. She's fabulous here & the attitude she carries to portray a women fighting a serious illness, is nerve-wracking. Zumann is natural to the core & his scenes with Benning, are the emotional core of the film. Crudup, sandwiched between 3 beautiful women & a rebelling teenager, is a delight. He gets a smaller roll compared to the others, but he leaves a solid impression. On the whole, '20th Century Women' is A Wonder Of A Film. Two Big Thumbs Up!"

This is due to some gimmicky directorial choices by Mr. Mills which only widen the generational gap of the characters and period details. He overuses archival footage, voice-over narration, recognizable pop music, and timely references in order to fill in exposition about the times. But in doing so, he undercuts the dramatic tension of his plot and story. His pacing is too leisurely edited and the characters' action take a while to coagulate and interact. However, the words from his script are eloquent and quite effective as he creates vibrant characters worthy of your attention. Mr. Mills also assembles a lively cast of actors that elevate the material. Annette Bening's understated performance as the independently minded Dorothea, a former 60's free spirit, is terrific. She shows the strength, frustration, and wit of a woman coming to terms with her teenage son's formative years. Playing her son, Jamie, is Lucas Kade Zumann, a talented young actor who is so natural and convincing in his role.Adding strong support are Greta Gerwig as Abbie, an advocate of 80's punk rock chic dealing with personal issues, Elle Fanning as Jamie's love interest and sexually confused girlfriend, and Billy Crudup as Dorothea's boarder handyman, a screwed-up product of the 70's himself.20th Century Women time travels and sifts through the years while its characters deal with various trends and historic events. The film celebrates female ingenuity and empowerment with its wonderful dialog and an engrossing story, even if there are some missteps on their journey to self discovery."
" So boring
",-0.3804,-0.4636,2017-02-04 00:00:00,2,"Reading the reviews of this bore-fest movie, I thought it was going to be this wonderful coming of age movie that would not only entertain but maybe even enlighten....NOT!!! I understand that the acting was good, which it was, but when do you watch a movie strictly to review the acting? NEVER!! This story is so slow, so boring, so meaningless that to give it any consideration for viewing is a huge mistake. I think the writing is so poor I'm amazed this ever got to the big screen. A great cast cannot and will not turn poor writing into a good movie.I kept thinking that at some point the movie theme and direction would straighten out and actually engage me....WRONG. This way too long of a movie never finds it lane, there is (in my opinion of course)just nothing here worth watching."
" Several all-time classic scenes in it!
",0.0,0.9888,2017-02-01 00:00:00,10,"'20TH CENTURY WOMEN': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new critically acclaimed comedy-drama, from writer/director Mike Mills (who also performed both duties on 2005's 'THUMBSUCKER' and 2010's 'BEGINNERS'). It tells the story of a single mother, in 1970s California, who asks her two friends to help her raise her son. The movie stars Annette Bening, Greta Gerwig, Elle Fanning, Lucas Jade Zumann and Billy Crudup. It's received mostly rave reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for several prominent awards. I absolutely loved it. Dorothea (Bening) is a single mother, who lives in a house (in 1979 Santa Barbara) with her son, Jamie (Zumann), and two friends, Abbie (Gerwig) and William (Crudup). She's worried about Jamie's well being, and she thinks he doesn't have enough positive role models in his life. So she asks Abbie, and another friend of Jamie's, named Julie (Fanning), to help watch out for him. Jamie and the three women all struggle through life's problems together, while also teaching each other about life. The film is hilarious at times, and there's several all-time classic scenes in it. The performances are all great (especially Bening and Gerwig) and the characters are all likable (I especially like Abbie). The movie is also extremely touching, and involving. I cared a lot for all of it's main characters; I really wanted them all to succeed, and be happy, and I could really relate to a lot of their issues (especially Jamie). A lot of my relationships with women, throughout my life, have been very similar to the relationships Jamie has with women (in this movie). So it's a film that really speaks to me. I've heard it's somewhat autobiographical too, and largely based on the director's childhood. I think this shows, by the amount of passion he put into the film, and I also think (because of this) that it's a must see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"
" Meh, Benning and the Soundtrack basically carry this bland film
",-0.0772,-0.8371,2017-02-01 00:00:00,3,"This was a pretty dull and pointless self-indulgent film that was only made interesting thanks to Annette Benning's talent and the soundtrack (especially if you were ever into the punk scene). Other than that, most of the delivery is bland and dull, the story basically goes nowhere, and I didn't really care much about the characters fate (although I did smile when they talked about Abbie's ending). The story basically revolves around the life of a teenage boy in suburban Southern California, who lives with his mom, two renters, including an artsy woman who gets him into the punk scene, and an aging hippy man who doesn't say much of interest. He also has a girl who is close to him, but doesn't have sex with him. However, she often talks about her other sexual partners, which is a source of obvious frustration for him. There is really nothing special about this family at all, and their conflicts and ""struggles"" are so ordinary, so bland, so suburban, so narcissistic that I just didn't give a crap.This might be appealing to those who remember the late 70's, and the punk scene, but otherwise, it's not worth your time."
" Sensitive New Age Guy Films Feminist Critique of Feminism. Or something.
",0.0,0.9883,2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"In late '70s San Bernardino, a Greatest Generation protofeminist, now a chain- smoking middle-aged long-divorced single mom with authority issues, Dorothea Fields (Annette Bening) is losing control of her fifteen-year old skate punk son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann). They inhabit her creaking Victorian manse which is under continual remodeling (Symbol Alert!). To make ends meet, Dorothea rents rooms to Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a brooding twenty-something hipster and recent cancer survivor, and William (Billy Crudup), a handyman, mechanic, and New Age seeker who can't accept the end of hippiedom and grow up. Joining this merry band is Julie (Ellie Fanning), a lonely pouting brat two years older than Jamie who hates her family (natch), sleeps around (a lot), and spends most of her free daytime hanging out at Dorothea's house and her nights in Jamie's bed (it's not what you think!). Free spirits, let us call them all.The tension comes from Jamie's emerging but directionless young manhood. Dorothea is a loving but incompetent parent, and the father has long since abandoned the boy. But at least she gets it that Jamie now needs more guidance than she can give him. William is too much a loser to be of any help, so she enlists Abbie and Julie to serve as Jamie's mentors (mentrices?). Julie asks the film's core question: ""Don't you need a man to raise a man?"" To which Dorothea (beating Murphy Brown by twelve fictional years) replies, of course, ""No, I don't think you do."" Well, let's see how that works out.Abbie introduces Jamie to the fading punk scene and to feminist literature dealing mostly with female sexual satisfaction. The result is a lot of pointless anger, noise as music, and Jamie's growing obsession with — oops, I meant ""awareness of"" women's genital fixtures. To help him further along this path, Julie steals Dorothea's car, she and Jamie rent a motel room and, oh, you'll just have to see for yourself, won't you?In weird first-person epilogues, the main characters all tell you how their lives will turn out ten or twenty years hence. Happy, married, and with children, mostly. The takeaway seems to be fundamentally conservative yet with more than a mere nod to feminism: traditional (the now-requisite adjective) marriage and family are the norm to which we snap back, even after periods and episodes of error and oddball experiment; yet feminism has taken some of the starch out of that stiff standard. And yes, because of it a young man becomes a better man, the ""sensitive man"" of certain feminist plans (see Mansfield, Harvey C., Manliness [2007]). Or maybe it's just that a parent's love makes up for most parental failings. With a little help from our friends. And the house? Like Humphrey Bogart (a running allusion), it belongs to another, more self-certain age, an age Dorothea is trying to restore, if only in its outward forms, while her life itself is being rehabbed by the social, sexual, technological, and political constructions of the times. Is it a comedy, really? Nah. More of a ""sweet lost mood"" pic in homage to the director's mom. The acting is completely convincing, though, so much so that you find yourself coughing and swatting the cigarette smoke away. Worth seeing, but without lasting effects."
" Three generations of women deal with social and personal change
",0.0,-0.8305,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"As the plural title suggests, the film limns the range of woman's lives in the last century, the century of feminism, its achievement and its restrictions. The release coincided with America having its first chance to elect a supremely qualified and experienced woman president — but opting for a ludicrous, disastrous male. Dorothea is the centre, a character of both ambition and suppression. She dreamed of being a pilot but entered the war too late and was grounded. Only in the epilogue do we learn that her next husband fulfilled her desire for a few years of flying before she died of lung cancer. Having wanted to fly herself, her compromised success at the end is being flown, being a passenger. Annette Benning in type and appearance here evokes Amelia Earhart. But in Dorothea, a woman with Earhart's desires has to play out a different role than the destiny she desired. Earhart had no kids. Dorothea also presents an unusual type of mother. The independent spirit that would have suited her flying serves her badly as a mother. At son Jamie's school she sides with her truant son instead of the principal. She relates to Jamie awkwardly, talking and acting unconventionally then retreating to her maternal role in defence: """"You can't talk to me like that."" Jamie's recurrent complaint is that she doesn't connect to him as a mother. Having borne him at 40, their separating gap is cultural as well as in age and role. She takes in stride the discovery that Julie is sleeping (albeit chastely) with Jamie. She doesn' t mind or judge either girl's sexual activity. But at her dinner party she retreats to priggish decorum over Abbie's ""menstruation"" and Julie's recalling her first intercourse. Dorothea's instincts are for the spirited and free, but she always draws herself back. So too in her scenes at the club and when the colleague asks her out. The contrast between her suppression and the two girls' openness encapsulates woman's limited liberation over the century of the suffragette and the feminist. Also unconventionally, she enlists her two women tenants' aid in making Jamie a man. A boy, she avows, doesn't need a man to teach him how to be a man. Women can provide better models and instruction. Indeed one of 1970s feminism was the questioning of traditional masculinity. What is the good man for the good woman? Julie's lesson on gratifying women provokes a bully's assault on Jamie as ""a fag"" for respecting the woman's needs. She teaches him (the woman's strategy) not to confront or challenge another man's ignorance. Also, ""Guys aren't supposed to look like they're thinking about what they look like.""William is on the cusp of the new manhood. ""I know how to get women but I don't know what to do when I have them."" He's respectful and sensitive when Abbie comes to him in emotional need for a sexual relationship. Presumably William's second wife leads him from his mechanic job to his preferred life, making and selling pottery.The other women provide variations on Dorothea's compromised or limited freedoms. Abbie's mother is a therapist whose only relationship with her daughter is professional. Abbie comes to her group therapy sessions but doesn't speak to her mother outside them. Or in the ones we see. Relying on her instincts rather than theory, Dorothea is the more effective mother. Julie's mother also retreats from her in shame or anger.For the second generation women their new freedoms prove challenges. Abbie is the more aggressive, as we see in her approach to William. Julie is more compliant, submissive, in her affairs. She is so accustomed to sex unconnected to love that she can't have sex with the boy for whom she really cares. Neither girl finds satisfaction or fulfilment in sex, or drugs, or unconventional relationships. Both undergo contemporary dangers, Abbie her cervical cancer and Julie a pregnancy scare. For all the warmth in this community there remains an abiding insularity. That is confirmed by one narrative strategy in particular. A separate biographical summary is provided each major character in turn. The characters are in the same story but each also has his/her own, a self apart from the plot and its interconnections. There is a self apart from the characters' interchanges.When Dorothea's old Ford bursts into flame at the supermarket it's an emblem for the century, with its wars, violence and loss. The film is about the 20th Century as much as it is about its women. The news clips and President Carter's telling speech about the modern malaise that results from instant gratification foreground the socio-cultural history off the period. For women helped define the century, its advance, its opening out of individual and collective rights, its only partial advance (see election above). Hence the specific setting, Santa Barbara in 1979. Dorothea is the early pioneer, her tenants the future. For the characters and the culture alike, social and personal changes challenged people's available resources and experience. Hence the emblematic description of the untalented punk rockers: ""It's like they don't care. They got all this feeling but don't have the tools they need to express itit all comes out as passion.""For all the failures of the century the film appends an optimistic epilogue. In addition to William and Jamie, both young women grow on to have families and satisfaction, perhaps in retreat to the traditional female stereotype, perhaps not. Abbie even gets two kids, her doctor having warned her not to have any. The happy ending may seem an anodyne imposed on a saga of fall-shorts and frustrations. Or it may be the logical observation that however we fail as a person or a culture life goes on. We have another chance. We may blow that too, but we have another chance."

Perhaps not every audience member will recognize the reality of this apparently eccentric cast of characters, but people who came of age in the 70s, particularly in California, will. And even those who didn't should be able to feel the real emotion of these exceptionally well-acted roles. Every one of the primary cast members offers a three-dimensional, psychologically deep performance. Bening is extraordinary as a woman in her fifties, unvarnished and beautiful, lonely and loving. Lucas Jade Zumann, as her young teen-aged son, seems to grow into his role as he grows up. Elle Fanning and Greta Gerwig are distinctly different women with depth and wit, and Billy Crudup plays his small role with a nuanced sincerity. I was not ready for the film to end. I can't believe that none of them was nominated for an Academy Award... but so it goes."
" ""20th Century Women"" is too personal to appeal to the masses and too insignificant to deserve two hours of your time.
",-0.34,0.9975,2017-01-23 00:00:00,2,"Mike Mills is a music video producer, graphic designer and writer/director of documentaries and feature films. He has made music videos for Yoko Ono, Moby and Air. He has done album art for the Beastie Boys, Sonic Youth and Ol' Dirty Bastard. He also makes posters and fabrics as part of a series of works called ""Humans by Mike Mills"". Why this biographical sketch of Mike Mills? Well, it might help you understand his films. Two of the first three features that he wrote and directed (not counting 2005's ""Thumbsucker"") are semi-autobiographical. His 2010 film, ""Beginners"" is about his father who came out as gay late in life (a role which won Christopher Plummer an Oscar). Mills' 2016 feature, ""20th Century Women"" (R, 1:59), is about his mother, a role that earned Annette Benning some awards season love.In 1979 Santa Barbara, Dorothea (Bening) only has one child and she's divorced from the boy's father, but she still has a house full of people. Besides her 15-year-old son, Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), there's the boarder she took in, a 20-something photographer and cancer survivor named Abbie (Greta Gerwig) and William (Billy Crudup), the middle-aged handyman who is gradually renovating Dorothea's 75-year-old house. Then, last but not least, there's 17-year-old Julie (Elle Fanning), who doesn't technically live in the house but might as well, as she often climbs in through Jamie's bedroom window to talk and sleep with him, as part of a very close but platonic friendship. Dorothea also frequently invites near-strangers over for dinner, such as someone she meets at a music club or local firemen who help her out of a jam.As a mother, 55-year-old Dorothea is loving and devoted, but also insecure and kind of clueless. She's deeply concerned about raising her son to be ""a good man"" in the absence of a regular male influence. (She rarely dates and William and Jamie don't really connect.) Dorothea's solution is to ask Abbie and Julie to help her raise her son. She wants Julie to look out for Jamie and Abbie to share her life with him. Both are a bit confused by the request, but agree to do what they can. Abbie lends Jamie some feminist books from a college class she took, Julie teaches Jamie to smoke like a man, and neither of them is shy about talking with Jamie about sex. Jamie keeps insisting that he's fine, but his world does begin to expand, just as his mother also comes out of her comfort zone to experience more of the modern age.""20th Century Women"" is boring and basically pointless. The film is billed by Mills as a love letter to the women who raised him. (Besides Bening's portrayal of Mills' mother, Gerwig's character is loosely based on Mills' sister.) Most of us were raised by a mother and/or had strong, loving female influences in our lives to whom we owe a great deal, but few of us would expect people to sit for two hours learning about the women who nurtured us. It's not that Dorothea is uninteresting as a character, but she doesn't come off as any more interesting than my own mother, for example. What's more, there doesn't seem like there's much to learn from Dorothea's permissive and scattershot parenting style and, excepting the epilogue voice-overs at the end of the film, none of the characters really grow much – or have the potential to inspire us very much. The acting is excellent (especially Bening), but that does little to entertain when it's in the service of an otherwise unimpressive film. ""C-"""

",0.296,0.6705,2017-01-22 00:00:00,4,"Big disappointment. There is zero dramatic tension in this leisurely-paced coming of age, homage-to-Mom film. A period piece set up the coast from LA near Santa Barbara in the late 1970's, it is the tale of a 15-year old boy and his single Mom who is worried he needs help becoming a man. So she fills the household with helpers. The characters talk and talk and talk and Bening smokes and smokes and smokes and by the end of the film you wonder why anyone backed this rather self-obsessed little indulgence. Bening is the center of attention, and she tries hard, but she wears as much as she delights as Mom. The other characters seem like stage props with lines. I found it hard to get with most of them. Several people walked out of the screening I attended. I was tempted."

I thought when the first historical footage was shown that there would be a little hint of connection to a more substantial indication of plot. But there was none. Little snippets of sex before birth control was readily available, and vague connections to the opening of the sexual revolution of the 70s. A bit of the roommates sharing houses, casual sex, therapy sessions, but nothing to maintain interest in the characters or their lives.

" Terrific ensemble cast, with career performance by Annette Bening
",0.4767,0.9977,2017-01-21 00:00:00,9,"""20th Century Women"" (2016 release; 118 min.) brings the story of Dorothea, a divorced woman in her mid-50s, and her 15 yr. old son Jamie. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Santa Barbara, 1979"", and Dorothea's car is engulfed in flames while she and Jamie were grocery shopping. When they finally get home, we also get to know Abbie, a 24 yr. old orange-haired photographer, and William, a Mr. fix-it-all, who both are renting rooms at Dorothea's house. Then there is Julie, the 17 yr. old who hangs out at the house for no apparent reason. When Dorothea feels she cannot handle the unruly(?) Jamie by herself, she enlists the help of Abbie and Julie. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the long-awaited new movie from writer-director Mike Mills, who last surprised us with the outstanding ""Beginners"" (now already 6+ years ago). Here he brings a character study of a group of 5 people in the late 70s. This movie immediately connected with me, as I saw pieces of myself in ""young"" people: Abbie (Born 1955), Julie (born 1962) and Jamie (born 1964). I was born in 1960. The movie features an all-star ensemble cast, with an almost unrecognizable Great Gerwig as Abbie (and on the heels of another outstanding role in the recent ""Jackie""), Elle Fanning in perhaps her best role to date as Julie, Billy Crudup as William, and newcomer Lucas Jade Zumann as Jamie. Surely we have not seen the last of him. But the biggest applause must go to Annette Bening, who brings perhaps the finest performance of her career as the well-intended but at times confused, sad and/or lonely Dorothea. Mills brings us these characters in rich detail and nuance, much to the viewing public's delight. Ever wonder what a ""cool cigarette walk"" is like? You'll find out in the movie. Music plays a ventral role in the movie. There is a fine original score (mostly electronic) by Roger Neill, but even better are the song placements (Talking Head, Black Flag, David Bowie, the Clash, and many others).""20th Century Women"" premiered to great acclaim at the New York Film Festival last Fall. The movie opened wide this weekend and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely although by no means close to a sell-out. Doesn't matter. This is one of the finer movies of the year, for me anyway. If you like a richly-developed character study with an all-star ensemble cast, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""20th Century Women"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

" A fine film with one too many things squeezed in
",0.2023,0.9948,2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"With a title like ""20th Century Women,"" it's unfortunate that the title takes away so much from the male characters, arguably an equally as important aspect of this tiny movie's impressive ensemble. Set in the summer of 1979 when times were changing without anyone noticing, it was a shift of culture that in retrospect took everyone by surprise. Mike Mills (the director who's other semi-autobiographical story was 2010's ""Beginners, a movie about an elderly man coming to terms with his sexuality) clearly has a lot to say in this movie which he both wrote and directed. It's just too much crammed into too simple a movie.Until I heard that this was based on the director's life I would have assumed this was a knock-off of ""Almost Famous,"" perhaps the greatest coming-of-age movie ever made. Both movies follow in similar tread, defining a culture that is based on drugs and hard rock. The hero of the story is Jamie (Lucas Jade Zumann), a 15 year old boy who's mother is Dorothea (Annette Bening), a staunch totalitarian that has a more sympathetic ear for her child's needs. They live in a house in southern California that is large enough to rent out tenants. Abbie (Greta Gerwig) is a photographer with flaming red hair and a knack for photography. She is a damaged soul. Also living there is William (Billy Crudup) who is both a handyman and father-figure for Jamie.As he enters his teenage years, Dorothea begins to see changes in her son that would have been filled with a father present (his absence is not touched on in the film). She recruits both Abbie and Jamie's friend, Julie (Elle Fanning) to try and guide him towards adulthood in her stead. This is one of the stranger aspects in the movie: that we see Dorothea and Jamie have a healthy relationship and yet suddenly she feels unmatched and lost in raising him. The tone shifts from nurturing mother and friend to stranger almost scene to scene, and I was left wondering what happened.Through Abbie, Jamie learns about the feminism movement and a bit more about her checkered past (an ovarian cancer survivor with little chance of ever having her own kids). Amidst the Oscar buzz for Bening, I found that Greta Gerwig was the real star of the movie, dancing a tightrope between comedy and tragedy with ease. With Julie, he sees a girl that sparks his interest and yet she brags about the other boys she has been with. The movie goes on and on sparking scene after scene in which voice-over tells us more about the characters than the words ever do. This is a gimmick of the director that he also overused in 'Beginners.' The narration helps create a more present image of the characters we see, but the film becomes more and more existential and loses a lot of the charm found in the quieter moments.The film also takes many sidetracks and turns that amount to nothing. An affair between Abbie and William is a prominent feature in the beginning and yet these characters never acknowledge each other again (even though they live together). Jamie's relationship with his childhood friends is glimpsed in a few moments, and yet the film would have us believe that he does nothing but sleep and hang out with 30 year olds found around his home. There's a lot of ground covered in the film's astonishing 2-hour run time, and in the end it was simply too much for one movie to process thoroughly.There's one moment in the film where Dorothea confesses that she will never know her son the way he really is. After going out with Abbie and hearing about the good times they had, Dorothea says ""You get to see him out in the world as a person. I never will."" Abbie (the photographer) pulls out a blurry Polaroid of Jamie smiling, dancing at a party in a blissful moment. Dorothea regards the photo and smiles. Out of all the moments in '20th Century Women' (both good and bad), this was the one that sticks in my mind. It's great writing and one of the more perfect comments on a child's relationship with their parents. Too bad the rest of the film wasn't as insightful."
" Brilliant!
",0.6239,0.9856,2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"What I loved about 20th century women was how evocatively it built the atmosphere of the time it was representing. The film was a sensory mood board of features from the years it captured and I really felt I was experiencing a passionately curated dip into the past. The films keeps up the momentum of engaging narrative, music and visuals and even the small intimate moments captivate the attention. I always love an unconventional pairing within a story and there was a sensitive exploration of relationships within this film which where fascinating because of the clever combination of differences. I Loved the matriarchal mother Dorothea she was a brilliantly tough sharp minded woman but her character highlighted the repressively resolute attitudes from the older generation within the set time of the film. In one scene, even an older woman as forward thinking as Dorothea didn't want to address the stigma of menstruation or the freedom women should have to talk about sex when two young female characters try to open up, and it really reflected the teething period of quickly changing ideologies. The film was a refreshing break from all the motivational career pursuit films, as the lives of the characters seem happily enriched through the exploring of literature and art in their own homes. The end sequence was unexpectedly emotional and gave a lot of wisdom to mull over!"
" A Multi-Generational Cultural Exchange
",0.0,0.9901,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"The scene feels remarkably familiar – Dorothea (Bening), the matron and saint of a Santa Barbara household circa 1979 leans in on her son Jamie (Zumann) listening to ""Fairytale in the Supermarket"" by The Raincoats. ""They know they sound terrible right?"" she says. Abbie (Gerwig), Dorothea's avant-garde lodger interjects; ""yeah, but it's like they don't care. They got all this feeling but don't have the tools they need to express itit all comes out as passion."" Dorothea fixates on Abbie's intonation, like listening to language she's only now grasping. She gets it...but then she doesn't.Much like Abbie's defense of The Raincoats, Dorothea believes she has all the passion to be a proper mother, but she lacks the right tools to support a son who is growing older with each passing moment. She decides to enlist the help of two young women; Julie, Jamie's best friend and crush and Abbie a free spirit who was recently treated for cervical cancer. The only other man in the picture is William (Crudup) a well-meaning former hippie with a gift for mechanics and a passion for pottery. Between them all, the stalwart Dorothea hopes to quietly guide her son through his formative years which pit her depression era approach, to Jamie's recession era resentments. ""Don't you need a man to raise another man?"" asks Julie. ""No I don't think you do."" 20th Century Women starts with competing voice-overs and uses a collage approach to convey the surfaces of each character's inner life. The collages are stuffed to the brim with stills of 1930's gloom and 1960's turbulence all set to audio of proto-punk, Jimmy Carter's Malaise Speech and ""As Life Goes By"" from Casablanca (1942). It's an awkward mix; one that creates an echo chamber of sorts.That subtle discordance of people talking at and not to each other, runs through the first half of the film. Jamie's coming-of-age story, a volatile mix of stubborn familial resentment and unrequited love clobbers together with Dorothea's own midlife crisis. ""I had Jamie when I was 40."" Dorothea says; a fact that can help explain Dorothea's free-range parenting approach, but also helps explain why Jamie's sharp insights cut so deep. For a while there it always seems like its Jamie versus Dorothea, pulled apart by an ever widening generational gap.Then, like responding to the blessing of a wartime parlay, the factions in this film begin to center and calm. It is during this truce that the film begins to really take off, presenting its characters with vibrancy and humanity while flying through a more nuanced story arc. Almost independently both Jamie and Dorothea learn their goals are one in the same and the differences they have are little compared to their mutual respect for time which presents itself in rainbow tinged tracking shots and subtle fast-forwards.And at the center of 20th Century Women lies the affable Annette Bening who suitably captures the zeitgeist of a generation no longer with us. While most might pigeonhole Dorothea as a madcap eccentric or worse a passive pushover, Bening wisely lets the character's inner strength shine through. Dorothea is unabashedly a one of a kind lady. She invites strangers to dinner, invites herself to punk clubs, leaves early, and then comes back days later alone. She verves uncomfortably with post-sexual revolution mores yet she quietly takes frank conversations about menstruation in stride. She does all this because she knows that with every encounter, every meeting, every stranger there's a chance for exchange.Of course 20th Century Women is not without its problems. While Bening, Gerwig and Fanning all do wonders in their roles, Zumann fails to endear the young Jamie to the audience in any meaningful way. Part of it is due to the part as it is written. The film is loosely based on the life of director Mike Mills thus Jamie at times feels more like an avatar than a real teenager. Additionally it's ironic that despite constant paraphrasing of feminist literature, 20th Century Women would struggle to pass the Bechdel Test. Our three women characters orbit Jamie's life and analyze his actions and motives like he's the center of their universe.Yet, while the film uses the wider Women's Liberation movement as window dressing, allowing the external conflicts of the film to melt away to reveal honest internal pain was a stroke of genius. Genius enough to maybe be interpreted as a meta-text on standard storytelling practices being a form of patriarchal oppression. That however is a discussion for another day. 20th Century Women is an artfully rendered film with plenty to say about the passage of time, the commonality between the generation gaps and the unifying love of mother and son."
" Life in fast motion
",0.0,0.999,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"20th Century Women isn't about giving us some epic look at a group of friends or a family, but it is about the passage of time with people who are warm and caring and in a genuine way. Mike Mills isn't a saccharine filmmaker, but he also doesn't shy away from sentiment - I always have to point out this is separate from sentimentality - and the feeling that I came away with from the comedy 20th Century Women is this warmth from all of the characters, and this feeling that I know these people, whether I did or didn't (and I actually did in the sense that, at times, the mother and son were me and my mom for a short period of my teenage years, so there's an authenticity just there to me).There's so much empathy for everyone here that it adds to the authenticity of the emotions, even for Greta Gerwig's Abbie who is, in essence, another 'Greta Gerwig' character like I've seen, or think I've seen, in other movies (her quirky wisdom seems akin to last year's Mistress America at least). While she is my least favorite person in this movie, she's given a history and many moments, surrounding one of those terrible things that happens to people and there's not much to be done about it, or could've, it's out of the hands of anything *to* be done. There's so much work done on the characters here by Mills, getting us to like them despite all of their flaws or those moments where they don't act with logic or sense, that it doesn't matter that there isn't too much of a story. This is the story of these characters in a short span of time while also, as if looking on from some other, ethereal plane, about what this time meant in the context of what came before 1979, and what was to come.Among the actors here, Lucas Jade Zumann is the breakout star as the 15 year old Jamie, but I was so taken with Benning and Fanning as the 50-ish, ""she was in the depression"" as she's described mother and the 2 years older than Jamie but that matters so much pleutonic friend respectively. I wonder if the film would've worked with any other actors in the roles, but really I can't imagine anyone else. Every time Bening's on screen she gives Dorothea this feeling of 'well... I guess this is happening now, what do I do about it, I'm not sure', and while she can get angry or concerned she's never one to go too over the top - this is the anti-Fences in that regard of being about a kid scarred by a parent - she does care about what happens to her son, with the ""inciting incident"" in screen writing terms being him almost dying from doing one of those dumb-s*** things teenagers do on a dare. It's a unique and subtle performance, filled with a sense of... questioning, uncertainty, which is harder to pull off than it looks.Fanning, meanwhile, is also having to underplay, which is good to see. This is an impressive year for her between this, Live by Night (which she was the best part of) and the Neon Demon, and she's different in all of them. I want to say I like the work she does here the most even as (or because) it's the least likable one among the bunch (and keep in mind she's a born-again Christian in the South in LbN). Mills's writing provides Fanning a great deal to make Julie come alive, but I found her not saying things, the way she shows Jamie how to hold a cigarette, when she is saying little, and then when she is backed into doing something that she should want to do but doesn't go for - going past being 'just friends' with Jamie in the last third - how she responds is devastating. It's like, 'no, don't act this way', as opposed to simply looking at her as a ""B""-word, which is how a hackier writer could've gone with it.Oh, and I must reiterate this is a comedy, and it's funny as hell. There's certainly some dramatic stretches, but Mills mines a lot of humor out of generational splits - Bening's face as she hears early Black Flag, and then trying to ""move"" to it with Billy Crudup, is one of the funniest things this year - and it's a tricky balance that Mills finds between making the feminism (yes, actual literature and quotes spoken in voice-over from essays) serious AND humorous. We don't doubt that the feminism of the characters is pure, but there's also that question that's posed: how much is really appropriate, or can be legitimately understood, by 15 year old who barely knows who he is in this world? And on top of this Mills is having fun and some daring as a filmmaker, using psychedelic colors to show cars driving at times, and going not for the slow-motion but fast-motion speed, but not for comedy - the aesthetic point matches up with what the movie's about: life moves too fast, and we have to try and keep up with it best as we can and grow with things and become better people as everything moves too quickly. If it's ultimately too episodic to be anything really great or up to be there with the very best this year, I'd still tell anyone who likes smart character independent(ish) movies centered on teenagers and adults to see it immediately; it has a good place alongside The Squid and the Whale and, to a less taboo extent, Diary of a Teenage Girl."

",0.0,0.9978,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Elle Fanning uggh yes. Okay, now that that's out of the way lets get to this film. This seemed like an unconventional coming of age film and that is basically what this was. Its not a mindblowingly amazing film and has some flaws. However, what I thought was a flaw may have worked for another viewer. What I can say though, is that the film left a better impression on me than I thought it would.The performances of this film are great, particularly that of Greta Gerwig and Annette Bening. Gerwig is such a real character who is pained but absolutely does what she wants to do in life. She has a hard time finding love but her very open nature makes her identifiable. Bening is tremendous in the best role I've seen from her. She's an easygoing mother who is worried about her son and how he deals with life. Remarkably cool but nuanced. Also, Elle Fanning good lord I love her. Okay, I had to get that out of my system again. All of the characters have substantial depth and you do not leave the film feeling like a character's story was underdeveloped. The main core of characters are all in close proximity with each other and through their interactions you get to see their turmoils, struggles, and comfortable nature with each other.The stories of the characters of the film are at times told by themselves and they seem to be telling the story from a future time, where they have experienced the entirety of their lives. I liked this technique of expansive storytelling. However, there are other things in the film that don't work as well. The slideshow of images of the culture of the 70's seemed gimmicky and didn't exactly add to the film's narrative. It seemed like an attempt to be able to grab viewers but wasn't exactly necessary. There are also times where the scenes have a ""psychedelic effect"" where the car races off in the highway in a dreamy haze, full with the colors of the rainbow emanating from the car. Again, I thought this was quite gimmicky and trying to harden the fact that this film was supposed to be set in the 70s.I think one of the things that worked with the film was its humor. There is a lot of it, and while its not always subtle and funny a good amount of it works to make you chuckle or really laugh. Its not something I was expecting but is definitely something that made the film more memorable. There are some scenes that really, really work and help you really want to live in the frame of the characters. The film really focuses on women at the time and a teenage boy trying to navigate in a sea of women in his life. While its not always accurate about men, I think its doing a pleasant job of trying to connect the two while showing some of the plights experienced when men and women try to understand each other. What you get here is a well acted, humorous films that works to entertain.7/10"
" Gripping, emotional, and unique.
",0.1531,0.9866,2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"20th Century Women caught me by surprise, this wasn't on my radar until recently, and thank god I found it. This movie is amazing. The story follows a young boy growing up without any prominent male figure so his mother and people around him help raise him. This movie has a very entertaining and enjoyable story that will make just about anyone smile. The acting in this movie is very good, Elle Fanning is only becoming a better actress in each and every movie she is in. The music, while subtle, helps bring emotion to each and every scene. My only problems with this movie is with some of the editing and cutting. In some cases, scenes didn't transition well. One minute we're watching these characters party and having a great time and within 30 seconds we're right in the middle of a really deep and sad scene. The movie should have transitioned the scenes better so that way the audience could have gotten emotional along with the characters. Overall, the editing errors weren't big enough to effect the overall film. 20th Century Women is smart, witty, funny, emotional, grounded, and thought provoking."
" communal confusion
",-0.296,0.9447,2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/director Mike Mills has found a niche, and a form of therapy, by exploring and exposing his life in a most public manner  on the silver screen. Beginners (2010) brought us the story of his father's (an Oscar winner for Christopher Plummer) late life pronouncement of homosexuality. This time, Mr. Mills turns his lens and his pen towards his mother, and he seems to understand her much better in retrospect than in the summer of 1979 when the film is set.This can be viewed as the story of three women, masked as a coming-of-age story for a teenage boy. Annette Bening stars as Dorothea, a chain-smoking single mother in her mid-50's who seems to have surrendered to her own sadness and loneliness, while simultaneously trying to make sense of a changing world. One of her tenants is Abbie (Greta Gerwig), a photographer and NYC punk scene drop-out, who is now battling cervical cancer. The third female is the seemingly always present Julie (Elle Fanning), a sexually promiscuous and borderline depressive 18 year old who values the platonic friendship she has with Dorothea's 15 year old son Jamie (Lucas Jade Zuman).Factor in another tenant in the form of laid-back handyman and former hippie William (Billy Crudup), and we have a makeshift family in a communal setting that seems almost normal for 1979 Santa Barbara. Dorothea enlists the other two women to show Jamie their lives – the intent being to influence his growth in ways an older mother can't. Of course, Jamie is at the age where exploring life isn't necessarily best served by tagging along on a trip to the gynecologist with Abbie or having no-touch sleepovers with Julie.Ms. Bening finds her groove as the story progresses and we feel her struggling to connect to each of the characters. When William plays a Black Flag song, her reaction is priceless: ""They know they're not good, right?"" She doesn't mean it as a put down, but rather her attempt to understand why her son is drawn to this. An even more emotionally naked moment occurs when Jamie is reading a passage from ""The Feminine Mystique"" to his mother. It's a passage that captures what he thinks of her, as well as what she thinks of herself  a mostly invisible woman finding it difficult to be a parent while also maintaining a self.Mills is not one to be nostalgic or glorify the past. His brilliant writing includes lines like ""Wondering if you are happy is a great short cut to being depressed."" The movie can be slow moving at times, but it's the best I've seen in awhile at expressing what makes us tick. The film is what Running with Scissors should have been. Real people are sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, and sometimes annoying. Each of the characters here are all of the above (just like you and me)."
