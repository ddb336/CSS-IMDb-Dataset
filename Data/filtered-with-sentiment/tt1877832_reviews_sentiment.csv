" Excellent
",0.5719,0.9643,2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"Review By Kamal KQuite possibly the best of the X-Men franchise, both original and prequel reboots. The acting was amazing for a Sci-fi movie. James McAvoy's performance here was really good. The McAvoy/Stewart scene was pretty epic. I wish this was the last of the X-Men movies cause it was such a great bookend...but sadly they made more...crappy ones. Fight scenes were very good. Showcasing different powers were done well. Seeing the old X-men was very nostalgic and seeing their fates at the end was very heartbreaking if you ever watched the previous movies before the prequels."
" THE GREATEST X-MEN MOVIE
",0.6369,0.9398,2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"This is the greatest X-Men movie in my opinion, without a doubt, the story and the acting are phenomenal, the ending is fantastic, and the effects in this film are amazing. Alongside all of this, the cast is massive and full of great actors, it's sequels may not have been amazing, but this movie paves the way for them nicely"
" Lazy retconning undermines an otherwise fun film.
",-0.1531,0.8013,2021-02-03 00:00:00,6,"The film would be a lot more engaging if it wasn't in a much larger series. The storyline uses an interesting take on time travel and the writing keeps the mechanics mostly clear and clean. Likewise, Singer's direction keeps the proceedings grand and satisfying with inventive scenes and period detail. But fundamentally this film is a soft-reboot of the series that mainly exists to erase X-Men 3 and other media properties the fans were not fond of. In short, it is fan service."
" X-Men: Days of Future Past 2014 Review
",0.0,0.9971,2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,"Time travel can really be a mixed bag, either they hit it home or they just make no sense. Days of Future Past does it just right. It can be confusing at points, and especially at the end, but you can still piece it together pretty well.
The action though, is definitely the highlight of the film. Right from the start Days of Future Past really shows off an amazing range and use of powers from some new mutants, and some old. That really carries through the entire film too, making you even care more about side characters from the previous X-Men installments.
The Quicksilver kitchen scene was probably my favorite.
Acting wise, other than McKellen, Stewart, and Jackman who have all proven themselves in the past films, James McAvoy does an amazing job as young Prof. X.
I really think my only complaint with this film is the pacing, I had a real probably with this movie slowing down, picking back up, slowing down, and picking back up. It made the film seem a lot longer than it was and honestly made it drag a bit.
But other than that, action was amazing, the execution of time travel was well done, McAvoy had an amazing performance and was all around a good watch. Definitely a good mix of the old, and the new enough to make any X-Men fan happy."
" Could've been so much better.
",0.4902,-0.7701,2020-12-16 00:00:00,7,"Great ideas but sadly not that good writing. A ""coward"" writer i would say, it's the feeling when curtain moments could've been so much better but due to the writer they had to be these unsatisfying and illogical ways. There are some good moments but overall the movie was so disappointing, but still worth watching."
" Worse X-men movie yet.
",-0.4767,0.9823,2020-11-14 00:00:00,2,"I haven't seen the Dark Phoenix yet but it can't be worse than this. First of all, if this was a drama movie then it would be outstanding, but this is not what X-Men should be. As an action movie though it's one of the most boring movie ever! Although the movie carries a sentimental value, and the plot is somewhat neeth and clever, absolutely NOTHING happens action wize, which is sad when you concider what a X-Men movie should be. A thrilling, clever, heart thumping, action packed ride with interesting characters showcasing their abilities creatively. Sure, It's always nice to see Wolverine and all our favorite X-men characters on screen, but what's the point if you never get to see them in action? It's like buying a Ferrari for the sake of just watching it with no intention of ever driving it. That's just pathetic and totally waste of time. Steer clear of this stink bomb and watch something else. You can thank me later!"
" An excellent movie

" A Milestone
",0.0,0.9991,2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,"I am not very used to films that have characters from the comic book universe as their theme, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about the characters and the films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of events starting with prequels.This film begins in the relatively near future where Humanity has gone to war against mutants, seen as a real threat to the future of the world. And they are winning! There are fewer and fewer mutants thanks to the Sentinela Program's hunting robots, created decades earlier with the mission of developing defenses in an eventual large-scale war. Isolated in what appears to be an inaccessible spot in Tibet, the surviving X-Men allied themselves with Magneto and what remained of the Mutant Brotherhood in a kind of last stronghold of combat. Here, when using their gifts and abilities together, they decide to send Wolverine (the most resistant and the only one capable of self-regeneration) on a risky mission to the past, in order to interrupt the chain of events that would give rise to the Sentinel Program and waging war before it even starts.The film is excellent in every way, but it is necessary to be attentive to understand well, given that it takes place at the same time in the present (which corresponds to a future close to ours) and in the past. Brilliantly directed by Bryan Singer, the film has a very pleasant pace and there are no dead moments or scenes that feel out of place. Everything works like clockwork. Of course, the action is an essential part of the film. The script is original and creative, but accessible enough to be understood without having to think too much. On the one hand, it gives a logical follow-up to the events of the previous films, and on the other hand it creates a temporal paradox where the whole story is corrected, so the films that will come later will focus on this new line of events. I believe that one of the most symbolic moments of this film is the short conversation that young Xavier has with his older alter-ego of the future, a truly anthological moment.The cast is massively inherited from previous films and is composed of great actors. The majority, therefore, are already familiar with the characters, and there are many characters and a large number of great actors. The quality of the material given to the actors was reflected in the quality of their work, which is really good. Hugh Jackman has all the prominence in this film and knows how to use it. The character Xavier appears in its two cinematic versions (the mature Xavier by Patrick Stewart and the young Xavier by James McAvoy) and the same goes for Magneto/Erik (the young version is brilliantly played by Michael Fassbender while the mature version belongs to the impeccable Sir Ian McKellen). Jennifer Lawrence shone in the role of the cruel and cold Raven/Mystique and Halle Berry finally managed to find herself as Storm after a series of average performances. The film also features Nicholas Hoult, Ellen Page, Anna Paquin, Peter Dinklage, Shawn Ashmore, Omar Sy, Evan Peters, Josh Helman, Famke Janssen and James Marsden.In addition to these merits, the film has excellent production values that should be highlighted. Its a Marvel film and there are huge millions of dollars involved, which is quite evident from the beginning. Visually it is a show in itself, with great visual effects and the best CGI that money could buy. The scenes and action sequences are great and the effects are a bonus, although the final fight sequence against the robots sometimes seems excessive. As happened almost always in this franchise, the film has excellent sets and costumes and there is a pleasant feeling of time in the scenes from the Sixties, thanks to all the details that we are observing. Cinematography is good and uses color and shadow well. The editing work was impeccable. I think it is fair to also greet the makeup department and the great soundtrack by John Ottman."

How could Logan just ""Wake up"" back in the new time line, but have also been active in it? He's clearly got a past with all of them, but is now some how completely unaware of it?? Did everyone have to reintroduce themselves to him or do his memory's come back??"

" Best X Men movie ever. Even better than Logan
",0.7964,0.9911,2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,"Very action packed, thriller movie and the best in the x men movie series even better than Logan. The movie has comeback of many characters from past movies which was one of the best things about it. The story was mind blowing, very intelligent and thought provoking. Movie has very intense fight scenes, action scenes and very suspenseful story progression that will keep you at the edge of your seat thought the whole film. Very captivating, gripping, has excellent catchy visual effects, cgi, fast paced, and great screenplay. Everything about the movie is excellent. I have watched it more than 10 times and still desire to watch it another time. Very underrated film which is better than Logan in terms of literally everything like story, screenplay, action scenes and music. Watching wolverine getting old sucks. The movie has young active wolverine unlike old, vulnerable one in logan who could barely run on his own. The movie is literally a Masterpiece. A must watch for action adventure movie lovers"
" 1981
",0.0,0.8473,2020-08-06 00:00:00,10,Enjoyed this very exellent written and drawing comic in 1981 with it's what if. The story in the movie is taking a different path and show sentinels more envolved showing they could have been the scariest thing ever created by men. This story in the comics made it so that we understand we do not want this future. This movie did an great job in showing this.
" Fresh premise
",0.3182,0.905,2020-08-04 00:00:00,7,"This film uses a rather fresh premise to expand on the X-men franchise. Sure, it is not the only film to use time travel, but it really uses it quite well here to bring all the characters together in new and interesting scenarios. The overarching conflict is a bit contrived as the sentinels are there ""just because"" but the heroics make up for it."

" From Present to Past to make a great Future
",0.6249,0.9931,2020-05-13 00:00:00,8,"X-Men: Days of future is an superhero action movie directed by Bryan Singer and had an ensemble cast of Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, Josh Helman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Nicholas Hoult and Anna Paquin. The movie is seventh instalment of X-Men franchise.To be honest if you have an option of seeing so much stars in one go and that too with a good plot you shouldn't miss the opportunity.The best part of the director is despite of having a huge star cast he is successful able to focus on each star and had done justice with their abilities. The plot is predictable but knitted beautifully. The screenplay is crisp and evenly paced so that despite of fast speed of the movie you can understand what's happening. Background music is another strong point of the movie and the visuals effects are mesmerising.Acting is great, stunts are marvellous. The Only little drawback which few audiences can feel is too much predictable plot.To conclude the review about the movie, the movie is enjoyable and entertaining. X-Men franchise lovers will love the movie."
" James and Michael are awesome!
",0.6588,0.8519,2020-05-12 00:00:00,9,"James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are awesome in their roles as Magneto and Professor X.
Just as Hugh Jackman as Logan.This is the best X-Men film right after Logan."
" Very good
",0.4927,0.8997,2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,Very good. Really enjoyable. Engaging. Well done 20th Century Fox!
" good movie
",0.4404,0.9499,2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,The story line in nice. The timeline may bother some people as it may be difficult to understand how Charles Xaviers was alive after the Xmen: the last stand. But the action and the effects were truly amazing. Wolverine had a major part in this edition of Xmen but I would have enjoyed more if I could see more of his fighting scenes. As a whole the film is interesting through out and will not bore you even for a second. A must watch.
" The Ultimate X-Men Flick
",0.0,0.9992,2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Both prequel and sequel to the original X-Men trilogy, Days of Future Past is epic entertainment that incorporates all the best elements of the previous films and brings the mythos of the comics to adrenaline pumping life.You may wonder how a movie can be a sequel and a prequel at the same time.. The short answer (I doubt there is a simple one) is that in the near future earth has been reduced to a dystopian wasteland in which robotic sentinels have enslaved mankind and hunted mutants to the brink of extinction, and the only way to defeat them is to prevent them from being created. So one man must go back to 1973 to change the past so that all can have a better future. And it's going to be a hell of a lot harder then he could have imagined.The plot is obviously somewhat more complex than that of the average superhero action flick, and I haven't even begun to get into the really complicated parts with people's past and future selves meeting and the questions about the nature of time itself. This story could easily have ended up convoluted and badly disjointed, and trying to explain it here is rather difficult, but when you see it on screen it all makes perfect sense, or at least as much sense as anything with time travel does. Beyond merely being coherent, the story also brings serious depth and a good degree of unpredictability.A story is of course only as good as the characters that fill it, and Days of Future Past is filled with excellent characters, brought to life by some of the best actors in Hollywood. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender made tremendous impressions as young Xavier and Magneto in First Class, and if anything they're even better here. Last time McAvoy was highly impressive as Xavier the wealthy and gifted playboy. Now he is absolutely brilliant as Xavier the tortured, substance abusing genius living in the ruins of his dreams. He brings remarkable pathos to the role, and watching him regain his ideals and his purpose is an inspiring experience.Fassbender likewise distinguishes himself, his intelligence, intensity, and personal magnetism (pun intended) evident in every scene. As Magneto he knows that his actions have and will continue to cause suffering and death for many and that people consider him a monster, yet he is firm in his belief that he is only doing what is absolutely necessary, which lends him a twisted nobility even as it makes him all the more dangerous. Jennifer Lawrence also matches her previous performance as Mystique, with her inner turmoil over her identity and nature as fresh and as relatable as ever. Between Xavier's idealism and Magneto's anger, she is torn between choices which could set herself, and all mankind, down very different and irreversible paths.While their time on screen is relatively brief, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen nonetheless bring a commanding presence which affects the tone of the entire film. Yet as great as these actors are, the real star of this movie is the guy with the claws. After six times playing the role that made him famous, Hugh Jackman has truly perfected Wolverine. Like he's fond of saying, he is the best at what he does and what he does isn't very pretty. Only this time he can't just claw his way to victory. As the one man with full knowledge of what the future holds, he has to be diplomat and leader, pushing people who are at their very lowest to work together to save the future even as his own past continues to haunt him.Lest this review give the impression that Days of Future past is all deep themes and character development, this is an action blockbuster, and it is an awesome one. The effects, both practical and CGI, are amazing. The sentinels are gorgeous, in a frightening robotic way, and the filmmaker's have come up with an even more impressive display of Magneto's powers than when he hoisted the submarine in the last movie. The battles are exciting and well choreographed, and find a number of creative uses for the various mutants'' powers. I especially enjoyed the scenes with young Quicksilver, which were clever, visually stunning, and utterly hilarious.Days of Future Past is the kind of summer movie that delivers in every way. It's smart, deep, well acted, well paced, suspenseful, action packed, and something of an emotional roller coaster to boot. Familiarity with the source material will bring greater appreciation but even those who have never opened a comic book will enjoy it. This movie is so good it literally wipes away the memory of weaker entries in the series. May is not yet out, but I feel safe in saying that the best movie of the summer is here."
" An Ok X-Men Film ⛪
",0.296,0.7243,2020-04-14 00:00:00,6,"While I was Watching this I thought it was Good but in my opinion it is not the Greatest X-Men Film.Good Parts of the Movie:° The Sentinels from the Future fighting the Future X-Men scenes were the Best Scenes.° The Wolverine meeting the Past Xavier and Magneto was Good to see.° The Past 1970's setting was Done well.° Magneto Lifting the Stadium was Amazing.° The Future X-Men Barely Escaping was Done well.Bad Points:° If Striker doesn't get the Wolverine's body then how does the Wolverine go through the Weapon X Program?° I wanted to see more of the Future X-Men and There story of what happened a bit more. They concentrated too much on the 1970's.° I wanted to see Bishop more.° Why doesn't Quicksilver follow them on the Mission?Overall, It was a Good Film but they really should of put more time into the Future X-Men."
" One of the Better X-Men Movies
",0.4404,0.7677,2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"X-Men: Days of Future Past was an interesting movie. I think that the whole Kitty Pryde being able to send people back in time was stretching her powers a little lot. However, I did enjoy seeing many new characters come to life on the live-action screen. Even though characters like Blink, Warpath, and Sunspot all had minor roles, I enjoyed seeing them in action, and think that they should get more prominent roles if they are integrated into the MCU. I think that Mystique should've been more true to the comics and been a true assassin, but that's not the way Fox took it unfortunately. The only reason I rate this movie higher than most of the other X-Men movies is because of the diversity in characters."
" Fun to the X-treme
",0.5106,0.9201,2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"If you're looking for a movie that has twists and turns and a plot that you have to pay attention to the movie to follow, this is it. I can easily say this is the best film in the X-Men franchise. It's got humor, heart, and a greatly satisfying ending. This is the ultimate geek movie. I mean what other movie has Jean Luc Packard and Gandalf in the same movie. (The actors of course, not the characters. That movie is too awesome to exist. This film is X-traordinary. There are too many boring parts though. But when it comes to action, this film delivers. This is why it's one of the best movies in the summer 2014 movie season.

" Yet another great entry in the series
",0.6249,0.9854,2020-03-20 00:00:00,7,"The X-Men series consistently delivers style and substance you don't generally find with fantasy films. I enjoyed the different characters, and the actors - as usual in these films - are very good. Although the film is a sequel to 'First Class', it starts in the future, and then goes back in time to follow on 'First Class', and then simultaneously plays in the past and future, so it can be a bit confusing. But - in typical X-Men style - they handle it so well that everything makes perfect sense.The visuals are insane! This prequel series is not as action-packed as the original trilogy, but it is captivating and a pleasure to watch. It's actually amazing how they made this fit into the series, with incredible attention to detail and taking all previous films into consideration. Stunning!"
" The X-Men sequel we craved so desperately since X-Men 2!
",-0.5659,0.9978,2020-02-28 00:00:00,8,"The Last Stand and First Class were both enjoyable but this one manages to capture the atmosphere of the first two films so well; it's a nostalgic trip while also being something new and fresh. The mutants have reached an apocalyptic state where sentinels reign supreme and are causing the near extinction of mutant-kind. Professor Xavier, Magneto and co. all gather in a remote location in order to change the past and affect their present, attempting to cease the existence of sentinels. With the help of Kitty (Ellen Page), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent back in time to reunite the professor and Magneto in their youth and find Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) in order to restore peace and order for their future. It's a top notch action-packed film while also having an emotional core that is genuinely effective; the exploration of Xavier's broken psyche and attempts to find his way again through Cerebro are wonderfully realised and beautifully performed by James McAvoy. The action is pretty flawless and extremely fun; Quicksilver's (Evan Peters) Pentagon jailbreak is visually amazing and very reminiscent of the legendary Nightcrawler White House scene previously in the series. Blink (Bingbing Fan) has really great abilities projecting during the fight scenes, making them some of the most memorable action sequences I've seen in recent years. There's too much to talk about in just one post but the ensemble cast are all brilliant and there's a genuine care and affection for the Marvel source material by returning director Bryan Singer, writer Simon Kinberg and the entire crew. Can't beat the X-Men theme tune too"
" Fantastic
",0.5574,0.9865,2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,"A perfect blend of the original cast from the original trilogy and the new cast from the prequel trilogy, X-Men: Days of Future Past is an epic, time-travel, action filled movie with, once again, solid themes, top notch visuals, great emotional weight and awesome acting.
The cast - both old and new - worked fantastically together and it was such a pleasure watching them all on screen.
Though, Incredibles 2 clearly took several ideas from this, sometimes practically doing rip-offs.
While I'm not going to get into any debates about the timeline and where exactly it all fits in, I will say this: the complaint about the cast not aging is a bit silly. Logan/Wolverine is the perfect proof that the complaint is silly. He doesn't age one bit over the hundred or so years that he's been around due to his powers, so it falls into logic that the characters' powers and such are probably helping keep them look like they've hardly aged. I could be mistaken there, though.
This is a fantastic movie and highly recommended."

This trend was bucked when The Wolverine was released last year, and this continues with Days of Future Past, quite possibly the best film in the decade-plus-old series. Rather than any of the actors, the story is the main star of the show. Flashing between two timelines, Wolverine is sent back in time to prevent an apocalyptic war from ever beginning in the first place. It's engrossing stuff, despite the inevitable leaps in logic and ignorance of one of the basic elements of time travel (which I will not get into now). It all culminates in a riveting and spectacular final sequence that tops anything any of the prior films have pulled out of their sleeves.

",0.6369,0.8984,2019-07-05 00:00:00,10,"X-men had introduced the franchise. X-men 2 was a worthy sequel. But after flops like ""the last stand"" and a passable reboot like ""first class"" i'll admit i had my concerns about this movie. Hugh jackman had left the franchise to focus on other projects and the latest film didn't work as well as it's predecessors. The formula seemed to be use one character to carry the story and use the other characters to give the lead someone to work off of. Much like a lead singer and a team of back up vocalists. Despite the films claiming to be about a team, they never felt like an ensemble piece the avengers franchise has managed.This film came closer than any other to being about the team. The film begins in a dystopian future 2023 where a few free mutants are running and hiding from machines called sentinels that are designed to hunt down and kill anything that doesn't present as baseline human. In a desperate gamble to undo the entire war they have been losing, they send wolverine back in time to stop the event that triggers the whole war of humans vs mutants.From this point on we follow wolverine in 1973 as he attempts to re-unite a younger professor x and magneto in the past while the future 2023 team has to fight off the attacking sentinels to buy him enough time to get the job done.With bryan singer returning as director, actors hugh jackman (wolverine) sir patrick stewart (professor x) and sir ian mckellan (magneto) this movie serves as a sequel to the original x-men movies and the new x-men movies by tying up the two timelines and in essence ""ret-conning"" the damage done by brett ratner's ""the last stand"". While at the same time properly helping the new cast with a proper ""passing of the torch"". Actors james mcavoy (professor x) and michael fassbender (magneto) finally get play the parts they were hired for by showing the audience their characters damaged friendship while still remaining true to their own convictions.The story telling is top notch, the acting is spot on and the special effects compliment the film beautifully at every turn. This film is quite possibly the best in the franchise and leaves the audience with a sense of hope for future x-men movies"

It seems the humans have gained the upper hand and the mutants are on the ""brink of extinction"" which would also kill the franchise, something they attempted with this film. They must stop the humans from getting Raven's DNA which allows them to build better mutant killing machines.Only Logan/Wolverine Man (Hugh Jackman) can go back in time, or at least his mind. Appropriately, he wakes up in 1973 a bit groggy with a lava lamp by his side and Roberta Flack eerily singing ""First Time Ever I saw Your Face"" a song more popular in 1972. Logan must get the team back together and convince them of the mission. Much of the film consisted of springing Magneto, which wittily included another era song by Jim Croce. Unfortunately they ran out of royalty checks and couldn't continue with that fun.The action/comedy/drama was a let down from previous films. While the film maintained the special effects, I felt Jennifer Lawrence's acting talents were wasted, although I predict she will take over as the slow motion/ stop action mode blue skinned princess from that Avatar blue thing.The film had potential, but the script fell short. Still worth watching as a fun popcorn film.Parental Guide: 1 necessary F-bomb. No sex. Jackman shows his butt again."

The plan requires Wolverine to reunite Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) with Magento (Michael Fassbender) to appeal to Mystique before it's too late.Visually, ""Days"" is a bit of a step up from ""First Contact"". Some of the effects are striking, particularly around the portal work in some of the present day fight scenes. Other effects, such as the Beast transitions are again improved upon. Plot wise though it's not as tight, driven by a desire to include all the X-men they possibly could (often more than one incarnation of them too) leading to a messy story that occasionally sacrifices some logic for spectacle. Why, for example, they decide they need Magneto with them for the mission is purely to provide Michael Fassbender with more to do. That's not to say it's not a clever story, managing to accommodate so many characters and bridge the gap between the original ""X-Men"" trilogy and this new series is no mean feat, let alone finding a way to explain a bit more of Logan's history and retcon the events of ""X-Men: Last Stand"", the unwanted sequel that all but killed the original run.The action scenes are particularly strong in this one, both in terms of seeing the X-men fight the sentinels as a team and in one like Quiksilvers ultra slo-mo scene (worth a whole additional star on its own.)Though perhaps not the most logical, ""Days of Future Past"" is one of the best in the series."
" X-Men: days of future past
",0.0,0.9964,2019-05-24 00:00:00,10,"I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters - but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot - and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves).What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations - at least as far as I'm concerned - is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists - what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride."

The best pieces of this film that complete it are the speech scenes. You also get a perfect blend of action and such a great score with this film being in the hands of Bryan Singer. Although the plot is very familiar to James Cameron's Terminator: Judgement Day with a shapeshifter that threatens the outcome of a particular species. It obviously isn't anything new but for an xmen film plot it is absolutely genius.This is definetely up there with Watchmen, The Dark Knight, etc. Truly an ambitious comicbook film.

I ended up leaving, thinking it was possibly my favourite X-Men movie.Rewatching it, for only the third time today, I still had the same initial thought, and the same thought at the end.
I have to applaud this series of movies for hitting some interesting social and political hot zones. I love both versions of Charles and Eric, but I prefer Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique over Rebecca Romijn. I really enjoyed Quicksilver too. The kitchen scene in The Pentagon is a real highlight.The movie also has an excellent villain in Game Of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, playing a mutant-hating arms manufacturer with an awful name Bolivar Trask. A bloody anagram of Stark, as a surname is lazy and awful.X-Men: Days Of Future Past grossec $233 million at the domestic box office, to end 2014 as the 9th highest grossing movie of 2014."
" An incredible film that ties both trilogies together.
",0.0,0.9879,2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"One of the more difficult plots to pull off in a film is that of the simultaneous prequel/sequel. Perhaps the most famous of this plotline is The Godfather: Part II (1974). However, I would argue that X-Men: Days of Future Past perfected it. Just like X-Men: First Class (2011) before it, Days of Future Past takes the retro stylings of its decade (this time the 1970's) and places a plot intertwined with the well-known figures and events of the time. It also simultaneously puts the X-Men in a dire and hopeless situation in a distant future, thus driving the need to go into the past to fix the initial conditions that got them into this quandary. Plus, most of the film is driven by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), which just shows how vital he is to the series.In a return to form that was sorely missing in the previous two films of the series, Bryan Singer directs a film that requires the plots of each of its predecessors to create its narrative. Some will say that the ending negates the need for any of the other films in the saga, but I would almost argue that the other films are needed to show just how much was saved by traveling into the past. This film needed its four predecessors in order to become an awesome wrap-up for the series. It's definitely my favorite of them all, including its sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse (2016).Not only is the action incredible in this film, but the character development is commendable. The scene-stealing comedy of Quicksilver (Evan Peters) tied with his slow-motion sequence completely cemented this film as the superhero film all others should strive toward. I would have been fine if the series ended at this point, as it accomplished everything the X-Men series needed to, thus giving Bryan Singer the end of the trilogy he truly wanted to create with the original trilogy.An incredible film that ties both trilogies together, I give X-Men: Days of Future Past 5.0 stars out of 5."

To handle this time-traveling extravaganza, Bryan Singer returned to the director's chair and provides a movie that never gets lost in its own conceit.Singer's biggest strength is his ability to place comic heroes into our reality, with the film covering real world threats that move beyond the mutant microcosm. The film is also visually stunning with the Nimrod Sentinels battles, as well as the instantly iconic Quicksilver sequence, viewers are treated to some of the strongest action in this franchise.

I have never really liked McKellan as Magneto. He gives a good enough performance but I always thought he was a bit too old and not masculine enough. Fassbender though is a great piece of casting. He exudes power and menace. The scene where he lifts the stadium is quite breathtaking. All the characters are enjoyable in fact, especially quicksilver whose scenes are perfection.

I had two virtues to look at this1. The events of 1973 of mystique killing stark leads to this movie. Now you should think that X -men , X- men united and X- men last stand never happened and that is why Xavier and others are shown alive. So if stark was killed this is the next movie after X-men first class and forget all parts ever happened. This way you will love the movie.2. Now u have to think this way also that this movie never happened ( in future events).
Because the purpose was to stop mystique from killing stark and they succeeds in it.
Now this means that stark wasn't killed And was arrested and sentinel program shut down.
That makes sense in making all the X men movies and in X- men last stand whatever happened is the true happennings, Xavier is no more , Jean and all othersSo This movie is just about ifs and buts, had this happened that would have happened and had this thing changed this way those( first 3 parts happened)Wat I gain from this movie is that stark was never killed by mystique and the events of past in this movie led to first 3 X men movies and that is to be believed. The future events shown never happened because the purpose was served.
I will say watch this movie without thinking much and just believe the future events shown in this movie never happened cause sentinel program never happened.So a thumbs up to the first 3 parts .An altogether perspective is that after first class it was X men and then united and then last stand. So DofP never happened not in past not in future.Greatest movie"

",-0.1531,-0.9233,2018-12-16 00:00:00,5,"The film was basically a feeble attempt to link the old Patrick Stewart generation of X-Men to the new James McAvoy breed, made apparent by the crossover scene where Stewart meets McAvoy.
I did like the new X-Men; Blink, Bishop and Warpath (although I couldn't really tell you what Warpaths power was except to see really far)
The new guy Sunspot was good but he seemed only a means of having an opposite for Iceman (in the previous films they had Pyro to do the same thing)It made no real sense in the storyline of Stewart's timeline; at no point in the previous films had they even hinted at the threat of Trask's machines, yet it apparently stated long before his time?
Are we supposed to believe too that Wolverine was brought back from Japan to the USA by Stewart and McEllen (at the end of the preceding Wolverine film) and thrust into a sudden war? A war that engulfed the entire world yet Japan (for the events of his last film) was completely ignored?And how did Stewart come back anyway, they never do reveal that big plot hole; last I saw Jean tore him apart at the atomic level, something only Wolverine himself could survive? He's a psychic not a healer.The ending too seemed odd, Wolverine had changed time and as expected only HE remembered the timeline before which is fine, but suddenly Jean and Cyclops were alive as though they were saying 'discard the previous films' (which to be honest is no great loss)
And showing Wolverine in the past being dredged out of the river by Mystique impersonating Stryker suggested a sequel with him joining McAvoy's lot which we know won't happen because throughout the film he haddn't yet been used by the real Stryker to give him his adamantium claws."

Special effects are superior. A star filled cast also features: James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Michael Fassbender, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, Nicholas Hoult, Peter Dinklage and Patrick Stewart."

I can't think of another film series that merges the old cast with the rebooted cast in such a clever way.

It doesn't matter if you don't know about Comics, because is a well written plot for all the audience, maybe you have to see its prequel for understand some scenes, but you can understand it without it, it's an entertaining movie for all people, with a lot of good characteres, good performances of very famous actors, some entertaining action scenes and an ending that make you feel satisfied with the movie. The message of the movie is that the mankind is one and that wars mustn't exist, we all can live in a Pacific world without racism and fear of the unknown. 
This movie corrects the mistakes of X Men: The last stand and open a new vision of mutants in the 20th Century."

Unfortunately, the mutants - and the humans helping them - are all getting slaughtered by the Sentinels, machines that were created in 1973 by Dr. Bolivar Trask (played by Golden Globe Winner Peter Dinklage) by using the DNA of Mystique (played by Academy Award Winner Jennifer Lawrence). Professor Charles Xavier (Played by Golden Globe Nominee Sir Patrick Stewart) explains that, in order to win this battle, Wolverine (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman) must travel back in time to 1973, using Kitty Pryde's (played by Academy Award Nominee Ellen Page) abilities. He must join up with younger versions of Professor X (played by Golden Globe Nominee James McAvoy) and Magneto (played by Academy Award Nominee Michael Fassbender) to help prevent the Sentinel program from taking form.What an amazing film. Not just great; AMAZING. Everything from the direction to the acting is awesome. The effects are amazing. The soundtrack is amazing. The actors are amazing, particularly Jackman and McAvoy :) I'm just going to say it; this movie is GREAT!!!"
" disappointment
",-0.5106,0.9263,2018-09-03 00:00:00,5,"I don't really understand why people seem to like it so much. I really enjoyed First Class - I thought that the plot was original and entertaining and I wish the director hasn't changed. This movie seemed cramped with emotions, complicated timelines and characters. Actually I'm not a big fan of time travel as a plot device, I think that if you use it you have to really weigh it and do it smartly and here it felt like they had to invent loads of new stuff that was absent from other movies just to make it work. I would have preferred it they just continued exploring the rivalry between young Charles and Erik and didn't invent this huge apocalyptic story."

" My favourite one
",0.0,-0.1531,2018-08-04 00:00:00,10,Out of all of the X-Men movies this is probably my favourite one because both the past versions and the future version of the x-men including the cast members merger together all for this incredible movie.In an alternative timeline the Sentinels have taken over and have nearly wiped out every mutant. But the X-Men are still fighting them. So Charles tells Logan to go into the past to meet his younger self and stop Mystic from ever killing Trask so that the sentinels don't invade.The movie as I stated above is my favourite and the acting was just perfect.My favorite scene was when Beast throws Wolverine and Logan's scream was just classic. If you enjoy the X-men movies or just love the X-Men in general then this movie is for you.
" My favorite X-Men film
",0.4588,0.97,2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie in theaters with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Good cast with new faces and perfect throwbacks to the past of the X-Men. Wolverine really steals the show and we get the Sentinels, those mutant-stomping robots that could be compared to the Frankenstein monster. I especially liked James McAvoy as Professor X, the leader of the X-Men. There were other superhero sagas I enjoyed, especially the Avengers, but this one took home the gold. It might be even better than that one. And it leaves the door open for a sequel. If you enjoyed First Class, this could be the one that outdoes it. I found this movie much better than X2. I wouldn't mind watching it again either."
" Yessss. Finally a good X-men in 11 years.
",0.4404,-0.9358,2018-07-07 00:00:00,10,Wow. Just wow. This film really surprised me as it combines both the old cast with the new cast. The film has a good way of showing us what has happend to the world since X-men the last stand and the wolverine which came out the year before this did. The plot is the world is overrun by robots called the sentinels which were created by Boliver Trask in the 70s but before that he was killed by mystique. The X-men have spread out over the globe and stick together in order to survive. The X-men decide to send wolverine back to the 70s to stop mystique from killing Boliver Trask. But in order to stop her he needs the help of Charles Xavier in the 70s but he isn't in a wheelchair he's walking using drugs but the drugs make his powers go. Wolverine succeeds but also needs the help of magneto but he's in prison cause he accidentally made the bullet curved which killed JFK. But in order to break him out they use quicksilver to break him out. They work together and they manage to stop mystique but also reveal to the whole world that mutants exist. The movie as whole works together so well. But the best thing about it is that the previous films don't exist in the X-men universe as they are now wiped out. So that means no more X-men last stand and no more X-men Origins wolverine
" ""Days of Future Past"" is X-hilarating
",0.0,0.9795,2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"4.5 out of 5 stars (nearly a classic)X-Men: Days of Future Past is one of the best films of the long-running X-Men franchise. It combines everything I love about the franchise: Interesting characters, good humor, and engaging action sequences, once again under the direction of Bryan Singer, the man who arguably started the public's fascination with comic book films. If you have not seen or have a general dislike of the X-Men films, then this will only confuse you. If you love the films, this one will entertain you.Logan (Hugh Jackman once again proving he's the only man for the role) has joined forces with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his once-foe Magneto (Ian McKellen) along with a rag-tag band of mutants who are fighting against the Sentinels, giant mutant-hunting robots created by Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage displaying that his small stature does not hinder his ability to intimidate).The situation has escalated to the point that the mutant's only option is to send someone back to 1973 and stop the Sentinels from being created in the first place. A mutant with the ability to project people's brains back in time does so to Logan so that he can get a younger Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) to assist him with this. Once there, he discovers that it was Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence once again displaying her amazing acting talents) who unintentionally caused the present problems. Unfortunately, Charles is in a mental funk at this point, and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is still up to his old tricks. Time is of the essence, however, so Logan must accomplish his mission or risk the annihilation of the mutant population.I cannot begin to describe how much this movie surprised me. The trailers made it look as if it would be one of two things: absolutely amazing, or just okay. Thankfully, it was absolutely amazing. The plot moves quickly, the characters are as engaging as ever, and all of the humor hits the mark. The story was written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn (Vaughn directed X-Men: First Class, which breathed new life into the series), and the two of them have that rare ability to balance humor and seriousness without there being tonal whiplash.Dinklage is the perfect man to play Trask, being so intimidating that you forget his dwarfish size. He is one of the best villains I've seen in this series, the second being William Stryker in X2. The viewer can hate and understand his goals at the same time, another rarity in an action film. The real standout performance is Jennifer Lawrence, who commands the attention of the audience whenever she's onscreen. Provided she doesn't pull any Lindsay Lohans on us, Lawrence should have a long and prosperous career. McAvoy also succeeds at playing a broken man while not making his character depressing. My only complaint is that some of the actors don't get a lot to do. Halle Berry shows up as Storm in the climax, but that's about it. Hopefully, she will get more to do in the next film.All in all, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a fantastic movie, mixing the five star rating by a grain of salt. It's funny, action-packed, and absolutely amazing.Rated PG-13 for Sequences of Intense Sci-Fi Violence and Action, Some Suggestive Material, Nudity (one humorous scene) and Language (not all that much)"
" Best of them all.
",0.6369,0.9815,2018-06-16 00:00:00,9,"It's clearly the best of all the X-Men films and the whole franchise including the Hugh Jackman Wolverine Stand-Alone movies and Ryan Reynolds appearances as Deadpool. This is a nearly perfect crossover of the old X-Men trilogy, the new bunch of mutants and at the same time this film deletes every mistake made by X-Men: The Last Stand. It's just sad to see that it's Wolverine who is going back in time and not Kitty Pryde. It would've been a perfect opportunity to give her a bigger role here. But it still works. Hugh Jackman has great chemistry with Michael Fassbenders Magneto and James McAvoys Charles Xavier. Also big parts for Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique (here way better than in First Class), Nicholas Hoult as Beast and a small but scene stealing moment for this incarnation of Quicksilver played by Evan Peters (and by Aaron Johnson in The Avengers: Age of Ultron). It's a fun ride. It's a time travel movie well made. It's handling a lot of characters very well. It's entertaining from start to finish."

",0.6486,0.9725,2018-04-25 00:00:00,8,"'X-men Days Of Future Past (2014)' serves as an apt goodbye to the original cast and a fitting initiation of the new one. This time-travel feature includes some great characters and interesting ideas but an occasional lack of action that does make for a drier watch the second time around, once you know where things are heading. Still, the lulls in excitement never last too long and there isn't usually a lack of character to drive the admittedly somewhat complex plot. The set-pieces that do occur are lavish and well designed, featuring interesting villains and impressively rendered superpowers clashing over two time periods. It's engaging stuff, compelling and interesting throughout. Most importantly, it's entertaining. 8/10"
" This is still by far the Best X-Men Movie to date and Its actually my favourite Marvel Movie!
",0.807,0.996,2018-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I was completely blown away after watching this movie. This movie was fast paced and filled with fantastic action sequences and great direction from Bryan Singer. One of the best things about this movie is the story itself, it is very well written and very interesting and it also provides some emotional scenes that motivates the characters including the audience to have hope and conquer your fears. Even though there are lots of characters in the film, They don't feel overcrowded and overstuffed and they don't feel like they are shoehorned in . A lot of these characters are well fleshed out and likable. This movie was never boring!If you don't know the plot of this movie, It's about a dustopian future in 2023 where the mutants are facing extinction because they are being taking over by the sentinels (Mutant killing robots). The sentinels have already hunted down a large population of mutants and humans who are helping mutants to survive and killing them or sending them to prison. Wolverine and the X-Men has found refuge and has decided to send Wolverine back in time to 1973 to recruit the younger versions of Prof. X, Magneto and Hank Mccoy to prevent the assassination of Bolivar Trask being set by Mystique. This assassination is what started this sentinel chaos in the future 2023. Prof. X thinks that if this assassination is prevented, that means that the future is reset and all of the X-Men characters are all alive and safe and sound. This also wipes out the sentinels in existence when this assassination is prevented. My favourite part of this film is Quicksilver. That quicksilver scene is one of the best and coolest scenes in a comic book movie ever! and probably my favourite scene in the movie. The Soundtrack for that scene was frickin perfect! Michael Fassbender killed it as Young Magneto! He was such a bad ass in this movie! and James McAvoy was great as Young Prof. X. I thought Jennifer Lawrence did a pretty great job as Mystique. She was a bad ass in this movie.There are a lot of great scenes in this movie that I will not spoil but if you watch this movie, you are going to like it! I definitely have no issues with this movie.What's so great about this movie is that it's never boring. even if the action isn't there, you are still invested and interested in the story for this movie and the interaction between these characters. The Time Travelling story of this film is very interesting as well.Overall it is a great comic book movie filled with awesome action scenes and emotional scenes to it and the characters are well written and fleshed out and you can actually care about them and be able to understand their motivations. The standout of this movie like I mentioned earlier is the story. It is so well written and satisfyingly epic at the same time. therefore, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best X-Men movie ever! I'm gonna give X-Men: Days of Future Past an A+"
" A good effort, but I expected more from the original comic book movie franchise
",0.648,0.989,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is the fifth X-Men film (let's not include the Wolverine movies in this count) and does a good job of linking the original trilogy (2000-2006) to the 2011 prequel, 'X-Men: First Class'. The story starts off in the not-too-distant future (i.e. a decade or so after 'X-Men: The Last Stand'), where the Sentinels have almost hunted mutant-kind - and some of human-kind - to extinction. The plus side of this is that we get to see grown-up Professor X (Stewart), Magneto (McKellen), Wolverine (Jackman), Shadow Cat (Page), Storm (Berry), Iceman (Ashmore) & Colossus (Cudmore) - plus new additions Sunspot (Canto), Bishop (Sy), Warpath (Stewart) & Blink (Fan - who? Yeah, even I don't know who Blink is - some sort of weird mix between Nightcrawler & Psylocke) - and how they're living in the Terminator 4-esque future. The solution? Send Wolverine into the past to try to stop the Sentinels from being created. (I'm not sure how Shadow Cat's phasing ability inexplicably lets her transport people to the past...)This is where - in 1973 - we're re-introduced to young Charles (McAvoy) & Eric (Fassbender). There's some good moments as they meet Wolverine for the ""first"" time, including drafting in Quicksilver (Peters). I'm glad they hinted that Magneto is his father, but it's a shame the same actor won't be playing him in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. We also meet Dr Trask (Dinklage, solid as ever), the creator of the Sentinel program and find out how Mystique (Lawrence) is out to assassinate him. I'm not sure why the films have so much focus on her, when she's not really that interesting a character in the comics and certainly not as pivotal as the films make her. Beast (Hoult) is good and I'm glad they got one of the original five X-Men in there with Xavier (no sighting of Angel at all!). It all gets slightly confusing, as the ""future"" X-Men fight off Sentinels to stop Wolverine from coming back to the future (had to be said!), while the ""past"" X-Men fight Magneto, Mystique & Sentinels separately!There's some pretty massive set pieces at the end, with all the sets/costumes of the 70s looking great/realistic too (including Nixon!), but it all seemed just a little lacklustre to me. A few things don't quite add up and I had higher expectations from the future battles, as well as from the young Professor X/Magneto dynamic. It felt to me like it was building to something massive and the pay-off wasn't quite there. Sure, it's an enjoyable ending (I'm still looking forward to 'X-Men: Apocalypse') and does a good enough job of linking the films/characters, but I think Fox bit off more than they could chew. It was a little slow in parts and Wolverine certainly seemed like a passenger with not much to do. There were certainly some fun scenes and some exciting scenes, but not enough to elevate this to 'Avengers' status."

" Solid...when it takes itself less seriously.

Not sure that this is true, but this movie works best when it laughs: history jokes and character tensions and winks at the camera. The moments of fun are great, and the moments of seriousness are almost unintentionally amusing. A little too much. Comics were never meant to be literature, and this movie mostly remembers that. A fun ride."
" Only got better with rewatching
",0.4404,0.708,2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"Probably my favorite movie out of the entire superhero genre. It can't compete on pure cinematography with Whedon, or the creative reinterpretation of Nolan, or even the visuals of Snyder.Consider, though, that it adds meaning to 4 prior movies that were made in the shallow days of hero movies, retroactively creating motivations and plot foreshadowing in almost 8 hours of cinema that weren't meant to go anywhere, while developing the relationships between the main characters and progressing the story lines of side characters in the background.It's an incredible work of art, and the piece that made me a huge can of Bryan Singer.However, it does sadden me that to get the full emotional impact from the film you have to watch X1-3 (and Wolverine Origins, too), which are nowhere near as good films and are extremely dated by today's genre standards.When I really want someone to watch this movie, I still do make them sit through the 8+ hours of backstory, but at least I feel a little guilty about it =P"

Things seem to go from bad to worse for the future of mutants.We are tempted to focus on James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, not to mention Hugh Jackman, but despite being fourth in the credits the center of the story is Jennifer Lawrence. She plays the pivot pin of the entire situation. Raven is a product of her past and Lawrence does a great job of showing her struggle to overcome it. Why is Lawrence fourth in the credits? I recently saw Logan and can't help but make comparisons. Both have action and destruction right and left, but this movie manages to do it without the gore and mutilation. Logan has little substance in the plot, but this movie delivers an engaging plot. In this movie we have good acting from most if not all of the majors, while in Logan, all the performances were mailed in. The reason I compare the two is because Logan has a IMDb rating of 8.2 and this one, as I write, an 8.0. This movie is so much better, in all aspects."

" Days of the future cast
",0.0,0.9792,2017-07-10 00:00:00,7,"While I liked Days of Future Past, in the end I felt a bit disappointed - not by the film itself, which was fine, but by the realisation that it was made as a rebooting vehicle.The story is fairly easy to simplify down to ""X-Men meet Terminator"", but the action scenes are good, some are even great, the main cast is doing a good job (James McAvoy for example seemed to me to be doing a better job than at First Class), while the (shorter than we'd like) presence of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is always superb. Peter Dinklage makes a fine villain, although his role could be bigger as well.The usual problem with this sort of time travel films is, ironically, the predictability. It was a particularly easy guess that the future heroes would die, but the mission would succeed, so no harm done. Which makes the death scenes of heroes like Storm or the parting words between X and Magneto lose all of their dramatic value, and work simply as a way to say goodbye not to the characters, but to the actors. Which brings us to the second issue - this may be just a personal quirk, but I do not appreciate alternate timelines. I realise it's a very common comic-book trope, but it seriously bothers me to have a film end by telling me ""you know what, all the previous X-Men films never happened! Jean is alive, everyone is happy, hooray!"". While I understand the reasoning, both dramatically and from a marketing point of view ('we want to make films with the new actors, because these ones are old' or something) I find it dishonest, cheap, and more importantly, subversive to all the previous movies.So all in all, I liked the film, but would much prefer it if it had somehow set its divergence point at some point after the Last Stand - though I will admit I don't see how they could do that AND include the new cast."
" Restores the X-Men series to what it was
",0.296,0.9283,2017-07-07 00:00:00,10,"Having Bryan Singer back in charge clearly makes all the difference in the world. This man was born to make X-Men films. The first two X-Men movies were excellent, also done by Bryan Singer. X-Men: the last stand was an OK movie with some very bad logic flaws but the two wolverine films prior this were terrible in my opinion. The first thing this movie does right is it appears to disregard these completely. Because of X- Men: the last stand, Bryan Singer had his work cut out for him to undo all the logic flaws and I must say I was a bit skeptical after the epic fail of superman returns, but you can clearly see that Singer has done his homework and created a magical film with a lot of heart in the story and characters. Without giving too much away, I will say that every scene is breathtaking. The story is a well-constructed piece of emotion and heart. What really makes this film work is the complexity of the characters, especially Charles Xavier (professor X, both older and younger), Raven, and Magneto. What all these characters have in common is they are all tortured souls. As for Logan, well, Hugh Jackman is always fantastic, but the real star of the show is McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence. All of their characters help you to feel something for them. This movie presents a time travel paradox, if you cannot look past that or are a viewer that prefers mainly non fiction, or cannot take sci fi leaps of faith, ignore this review. We'll both be better off.See this film. It is probably the best superhero movie of the last decade. The only ones that are of the same caliber of superhero movies are Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. In some ways this film is even better. Rating: 10"

However, after re-watching Days of Future Past on FXX, I think I was too harsh on the film when it was first released in theaters. If you think about it, it's basically the Terminator set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (YES I'm saying X-Men is apart of the cinematic universe because I'm sick to death of all those dumb asses who call themselves ""true Marvelites"" who are saying ""X-men isn't.""). That's the dumpy, pathetic moneymakers at Disney talking. Well, X-men is and always be Marvel's favorites, even as the years wear on. Without spoiling the entirety of the film itself, X-Men: Days of Future Past is a redemption mark for the entire X-Men franchise. Also, it was great to see Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart working together!"
" Fattest Mystique, Casting Ruined Prequel to a Great Original X-men Trilogy, Reason I think for such bad casting choice inside the review.
",-0.0516,0.9872,2017-05-08 00:00:00,7,"If you seen original X-men trilogy Rebecca Romjin personified Mystique perfectly any true geek could rave about it for hours how she was supple, agile, mercurial and rubber like she was imagined to be. Superhero movies like any other good fantasy fiction have to be best make believe as it can be especially each character. Here comes prequel movie series to original Classic X-men movies with The First Class and we get Fattest Mystique anybody could imagine Jennifer Lawrence, it was disrespect to the character. I mean how did she land the character in 1st place, she could never be the actor that would come to anybody's mind when imagining the cast. Even let us say Jennifer Lawrence comes to audition how could somebody of her physique would pass the audition, what did she do for casting folks to overlook the main aspect the character. Only thing that comes to mind would be casting couch which Hollywood biggies don't like to talk about and boy she must be really good at it too. If you seen the movie she in pure Mystique form she looked more like somebody who ate Mystique rather than the supple mutant, considering she was also actress who played main lead in "" The Hunger Games"" around same time didn't seem to one prepared for that. Sorry if you think I am being disrespectful but as a absolute geek I was hurt when they disrespected the character by that casting choice. Even the best way she used to show Mystique's physical ability herself without a body double was by doing that side squat bend like if you remember when she did when she was on table in Paris hiding behind Xavier from Magneto.The height of Jennifer Lawrence worship is so extreme that the complete story concept was changed, Mystique powers just mimicked to look like somebody not take their powers. So same way the sentinels made from her DNA wouldn't be powerful with powers but just mimics. Now that was big goof but now the director knew that therefore made a Rogue Cut.This all really ruined the movie for me cause like I said before Superhero movies all the actor must look the character more so than any other movie type. Some folks might argue she is acts well but they surely could find somebody who acts well and actually would fit the look and physique. I do appreciate she slimmed down a lot by third installment of the movie series but then there were even worse casting goofs in that movie.But since the movie is from amazing original X-men storyline and hence got a hit but would have been bigger hit if the makers had been sincere."
" Surprisingly amazing movie. Would Recommend.

To stop the catastrophe before it happens, Professor X(Patrick Stewart) and Magneto(Ian McKellen) send Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) into the past to prevent the ongoing war.Directed by Bryan SingerStarring Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This movie is just great. It is one of the best X-Men movies and is just a great time.The types of people who like this movie will be those who enjoy the original X-Men franchise and people who like fun, fast paced action.Would Recommend# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Hugh Jackman was excellent as Wolverine. James McAvoy was excellent as Charles Xavier as was Michael Fassbender as Eric Lashner. Equally, both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were both excellent as the older counterparts of Charles and Eric respectively. Jennifer Lawrence was great as Mystique. Nicholas Hoult was great as Hank McCoy. Peter Dinklage was excellent as Bolivar Trask. Speaking of whom, Trask was an excellent villain for the most of the movie.The story of this movie was, albeit confusing to the overall timeline, very interesting. The entire third act was flawless. The stakes were very high and that added to the story. The overall ending made the movie look like its purpose was to tie up loose ends and plot holes. I liked the cinematography was good all the way out but from the third act onward was when it became really good.The effects were awesome.The action included was excellent and looked really good. Every character in the movie was utilised effectively and served a purpose to the story.The Quicksilver segment was amazing. The hints towards Weapon X was incredible. Eric's speech at the end was amazing and memorable and really served to the development of the character. Personally, I enjoyed the first two acts but it was from Act III that this movie became amazing.9/10"

" Good. Evil. And somewhere in between.
",-0.3612,0.9973,2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" begins solidly if unremarkably. New and well-known characters are introduced. A legendary enemy is revealed. A plot linking present with past is established. This is engaging stuff, and the film quickly sets itself up as an engrossing adventure with a serious tone and high stakes. It all makes for something entertaining but not special.Something happens along the way, however, and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" begins to resonate stronger and appeal more deeply. In a scene where the Charles Xavier of the past is confronted by his future self, the film ceases to be a run-of-the-mill superhero adventure. It becomes the story of a man with the power to impact the world. It becomes an observation of his journey and his impact on the characters and world around him, past, present, and future. It becomes the human story of understanding fear and embracing hope.Bryan Singer's spectacular ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is more than a sequel to ""X-Men: First Class"" or a prequel to ""X-Men."" It is a wrap-around event that courses through and changes the world of the previous films. It is a grand piece of entertainment that respects what has already been established in the franchise's universe and opens up a dynamic future. Pulsing with memorable and exciting set- pieces, the film is a solid action outing but, more importantly, has the soul of a character piece. It observe the journeys, the developments, the shifts, and the fulfillment of its colorful, comic book characters.The story is involving, but the story's characters are its highlight. They generate humor, warmth, anger, and excitement. Their arcs are tragic, epic, and triumphant. Their eyes are haunted and hopeful. They are the comic book gods of a new Olympus, but they are as human as their audience.Bryan Singer is blessed with a cast that is able to at once communicate not only the fantasy, mutant elements of their characters' bodies and brains but also the disparate humanity punctuating their actions. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen serve as godfathers and guardians of their younger charges. James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender are both brilliant and burdened. They are ideally cast as broken men on separate paths.Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult both capture the vitality and impetuous juvenility of youth. They have suffered loss that colors their arcs, and it shows in their words and reactions. Evan Peters, as Quicksilver, is an underutilized revelation with spirit and humor.Anchoring all of this is Hugh Jackman. Here, he is asked to stay in the background, but his charisma and knowing ferocity hold the rest of the cast, and the film, together. Jackman's Wolverine is now a leader and a less an antihero. His mantle of teacher, like that of Xavier's in the previous films, suits him well.Singer turns in a film composed of exhilarating action beats and satisfying character drama captured with a subtle visual style. His 1970s are subtly swinging and sepia-toned. They are as vibrant as the cinematic world makes them out to be. The future is dark and cold. It is drained of color in crisp contrast to the 1970s.Singer's tendency to shoot his cast in closeup accentuates the importance of character over spectacle. It is a refreshing change of pace for this type of film. Cinematography, editing, and score all complement each other and sell the film's overall quality.All of this results in one of the most accomplished and, in short, best superhero films ever made. The drama, the humor, the action are all sharp and well-measured. The production is outstanding with its blend of artful comic book flash and focus.Of all these well-appointed elements, what makes ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" so excellent are its themes and emotional center. The film is more than a superhero romp. It is a film about struggle: not just the struggle against larger-than-life enemies, but the personal struggle with what human beings are and what they are meant to be. It is about struggle against the march of time and memory. Most importantly, it is about the triumph of hope over fear and over that struggle. This beating thematic heart of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the reason the film succeeds at such high levels. It is the grandly important center of a fantastic film."
" Time travel is an engaging addition to the X-Men franchise
",0.34,0.986,2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"There was a lot of love for DAYS OF FUTURE PAST on its release. It's a sequel to the X-MEN prequel FIRST CLASS that also ties it in to the older cast from the original X-MEN trilogy of the 2000s. As such there's an absolutely huge and sprawling cast of characters but director Bryan Singer just about manages to keep a grip on things so that it doesn't get too confusing.What surprised me about the film is that the much-lauded plot is nothing more than virtual copy of that seen in the TERMINATOR films, although perhaps as the comic pre-dated THE TERMINATOR it's James Cameron who did the ripping off. Certainly the story, about a future annihilated by sentient robots and the survivors sending back a sole hero through time in order to avert the disaster, is all too familiar, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is fun, that's for certain. There's a huge cast of familiar and unfamiliar faces and a constant stream of effective CGI to keep viewers occupied, so this is never a boring experience. The future scenes are clichéd and amount to little more than an FX showcase of robots vs. mutants with lots of mutant death to boot. The main story, which takes place in 1973, is better, benefiting from Hugh Jackman's likable Wolverine and James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender doing their best with their engaging roles. Some of it is still too familiar, a lot of it is too over the top, and Peter Dinklage's villain is oddly irrelevant, but this is still a fun watch, albeit not one I'll be quick to revisit."
" One question.. How can Professor Xavier is alive?
",0.3818,0.9676,2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"Hi all,I have one question, How can Professor Xavier is alive after he was died in 3rd installment (X-Men Last Stand) by Jean. May be I have missed something or may be this is plot hole?However, I loved X-Men movies but when I was watching this series second time then this question raised in my mind. Can anybody please clear this confusion ?? I think I surely missing something here as this can't be plot hole. If it is then it would be biggest mistake in movies for me.My favorite character of course is Wolverine. I would love to watch logan in Cinema. He is just awesome."
" Maturity shows on the actors
",0.0,0.9883,2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"So it's been 14 years since the original X- Men movie. Many actors were teenagers when this series started, but in this version they have grown up in more ways than one.Maturity shows on their acting and their ability to express subtle nuance in the acting which makes this movie more rewarding to watch.Dare I say that this is the best of the many X-Men movie that came along. Bryan Singer still have the ability to turn all the subtitling of the plot into convincing visual landscape. This is a very entertaining movie at all levels.I hope they would continue the X-Men franchise in this direction in the future. A movie well worth watching."
" An EXceptional Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.996,2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"I have watched every X Men movie ever made, I like almost all of them, they have amazing characters and thought provoking themes, I was beyond excited for this movie it was easily my most anticipated of 2014 and it did not disappoint me at all I was blown away by a superhero masterpiece than is the only superhero movie to come close to the greatness of The Dark Knight Trilogy. For one this film is perfectly balanced, despite all the characters and plot threads present in this film there's never any overlap, wasted characters or clunkiness, I was invested in every part of this film. Hugh Jackman was brilliant in this film not only is he hilarious as usual but he also fits right in with McAvoy and Fassbender characters who once again are fantastic together, we get the sense that these two now have a history that has deeply effected them both. One of my favourite elements of First Class was that we saw Xavier in a different light and this film is no different, we see him now as a broken man who is all out of hope and it was a brilliant way of showing his character. The future isn't in this film a whole lot but it's used in just the right ways, we have all the characters from the future together again which was so satisfying to see and seeing them all taken down together was amazing to watch unfold and helped to showcase the power that these sentinels have. The Sentinels are perfect antagonists for the future time-line they are clearly a menacing presence who make you realise the intense nature of the desolate future. The past time-line mostly centres around Wolverine and his allies trying to stop Mystique from murdering Bolivar Trask played to perfection by Peter Dinklage this story line was done just as well as the future, it was just as intense and the eventual cutting in and out of the time-lines added to the intense nature. The eventual conclusion of the past was done perfectly, it was really heartwarming to see Charles pore his heart out to Raven added to their bond. This last fight was devastating to watch but was ultimately satisfying in its conclusion of having the time-line restored and bettered. This is one of the only films that has ever made me disappointed after it was finished, because I won't get to watch it for the first time again but I could not be more pleased with the film itself, all the characters have returned and are better than ever, it perfectly blends everything and as a hardcore and committed X Men fan this film was just a tribute to the characters of the comics and the franchise itself. 100%/A+"
" A good addition to the X-men franchise
",0.4404,0.9209,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"A good addition to the X-men franchise. What makes it original is the strong contrast between the future scenes featuring a final band of X-men standing up to the power-absorbing Sentinels, and the scenes from the past featuring a young Xavier and Magneto.The future scenes feature some impressive special effects and earthquakingly powerful mutant-on-Sentinel battles. The opening sequence in particular is a cracker.The scenes set in the past are interesting for their insights into the early years of Xavier and Magneto but don't have the same oomph. James McAvoy is a little too fragile as the young Xavier - he's not a persuasive match for Patrick Stewart and seems to be easily outclassed by the young Magneto.The climax of the movie is a tad pedestrian, but taken as a whole this is worth a watch."
