The lead role played by Sushant Singh Rajput made us believe that he is MS Dhoni himself. It shows how a small boy from Ranchi has big dreams to catch. MS Dhoni faced so many hurdles in his way up but ultimately manages to reach to the top and win millions of hearts in India and all around the globe. One thing to learn from this Film and the story of MS Dhoni is to always follow your passion and dreams. Yes you will have many difficulties and hurdles on the way up but how you tackle them and get through them makes you what you are in the future. If you have the will and courage you will definitely achieve your goals.

" Inspiring Movie
",0.4215,0.9988,2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"MS DHONI : THE UNTOLD STORY! AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT BY SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUTFrom the beginning of the movie every one must have understood that their hearts gonna stop for a few moments! And they have not been wrong. I'm not highlighting the plot in detail as I'm pretty much interested not to unfold the story line as many of you will go to watch it.Let me talk about the best parts. First of all, Sushant's tremendous acting and dedication deserve a big thumbs up. Next Anupam Kher and Rajesh Sharma rightly have adjusted themselves to their spots. Herry Tangri (Yuvi) excellently has scaled himself with his character. Kiara Advani (Sakshi), Disha Patani(Priyanka) have given their best too. Well, now I must talk about the cinematography, here Santosh Thundiyil has done a brilliant job. Especially Dhoni's train capturing scene leaving his job and Dhoni's coming out of the dressing room scene during the World Cup (2011) Final help a lot to excel this film. Undoubtedly fantastic cinematography it has. As a director Neeraj Pandey is of course successful but somewhere it has lacked a bit of his special touch. Though it doesn't matter because you will not find a single moment that can make you bore. The story has real gravity and it successfully has followed the tag line i.e ""The man you know... The journey you don't"". Truly it has focused on his journey- his struggle, ups and downs etc. The dialogues are very inspiring and heart-touching at many places. It is around 190mins' movie. You may think it's quite long but trust me after watching it you'll think if it could be of 5 hours that would have been perfect.... Even the Dhoni-haters can't deny that.. Actually there's so much to tell about. Anyway, let's come to the background sound... Truly effective though at some points it could have been better. Except that the editing has been done quite well but truly it's the place where it has lacked a bit. At few points it seems to be less glued... sudden turn of the movements and emotions is visible. And another important part is the story line which is of course very good but few interesting points it has actually missed. It would have been much more better if there's a bit more details about few facts like Wicket Keeping, Yuvi, Dressing Room situation after the WC2011 Final. But still it's fine as I have said earlier that it has focused more on Dhoni as a man.. especially his journey... Otherwise it is actually excellent... Or better to say super-excellent! And oh yes casting is just amazing.So finally I would like to conclude like this. If you wish to watch it don't wait for the review just go for it. One thing I can assure you that you will not regret for a moment. But you may regret if you don't watch it or watch it by downloading from internet. If possible for you to spend some money please try that to give your respect to the hard works done by the cast and crew. I don't feel like giving marks to this movie as it may look disrespecting but taking it as a work of art I'm giving 9/10. Please don't listen to someone else if you feel like going then go...!!P.S - I respect you, Sushant Singh Rajput... Your career is going to get a big hike after this. 'Excellent' is just a word for you.Caution - You may find yourself in out-of-air-condition while the last scene happens, in spite of knowing the upcoming. ;) :)N.B- If a second part of it comes out, I'll not be surprised. There are lot more facts deserve to get unfolded.

This movie had some sentimental scenes that makes you cry especially after scoring good runs in a big match after years of struggle. The attitude of the actor matches exactly like the real M.S Dhoni. However, the editing is poor, the scenes are stretched, 3hrs is a long haul. They could have added more of Dhoni after becoming the cricketer that could involve captaincy skills on and off the field, that is missing."

" Painfully long with uninspiring and scattered story-telling!
",-0.5707,0.9974,2020-05-09 00:00:00,4,"This is one of those films where you feel if you watched a different film from what the world had seen, since it unanimously got positive reviews and for me it couldn't even come close to an average watch. Writing a review almost 4 years after the film's release doesn't make much sense but since my views are quite in contrast to what the world thinks, I felt like at least penning my views for once.This biopic has the regular trappings of a rise-of-underdog, rags-to-riches story. The conventionalism could still have been overlooked if the narrative was compelling. Alas what we get here is a repetitive series of montage sequences that makes for uninspiring storytelling of a cricket legend.The film at one point very rightly says that life is full of struggles and you need to keep batting the bouncers being constantly thrown at you. This applies true to the film as well which keeps throwing repeated bouncers at you all through and you are supposed to struggle through it. Not quite a pleasant experience especially when you expect entertainment from a film. Just to point down some major boring aspects of the film.
the Dhoni-Yuvraj Singh face off that the film brings pretty early in the plot was a very interesting premise but is never addressed in the film eventually. This thereby ends up being a cheap gimmick of using an actor (Herry Tangari) who resembles a young Yuvraj Singh, just for the kicks without any contribution to the narrative.the love story between Dhoni and his first girlfriend (Disha Patani) is extremely boring without any emotional gravitasif that wasn't enough, another love story soon follows with Dhoni and another lady (Kiara Advani) and the track is, more or less, similar to the earlier love story. Even if the first love story really happened in his life, it could have been easily edited out of the biopic, like many other tracks were.Dhoni's bonding with his friends could have been more riveting. They end up being some uninteresting characters in his life, whom we don't connect with much.All his family members from mom, Dad (Anupam Kher), sister (Bhumika Chawla in a forgettable comeback), brother-in-law and his coach (Rajesh Sharma), selector (Kumud Mishra), railway head (Kali Prasad Mukherjee) don't have defining moments in his life other than being used as mere spectators in the montage sequences of his matches.his life as a railway ticket examiner is a track that is overplayed beyond requirement making it protracted and monotonous.on the contrary, his rise to fame with his entry in the Indian National team is one aspect which you wish to have experienced better and stayed with more. Alas that is just hastily treated in quick montages. Even his gradual progression to being the captain of the Indian cricket team is simply fast-forwarded. One doesn't quite expect the film to show his interactions with fellow cricketers (which would have been a logistically difficult task to achieve). But there are no tracks explored in his personal life as well, other than the insipid love stories.the climax predictably set amidst the 2011 World Cup which India won, doesn't have the edge-of-the-seat moments either.at a runtime of almost 3 hours, this film is painfully long with boring romance tracks, repetitive montage shots of his cricket matches and uninspiring storytelling.at the end you wonder if the film was actually tracing Dhoni's dream? And what exactly was Dhoni's dream? If it was to make it to the National team, it is achieved by interval point. If it was to win the World Cup, that never comes across in the film! With the lack of a definitive pain-point, the film meanders aimlessly.Sushant Singh Rajput makes a modest attempt at playing Dhoni but seems one-dimensional after a point. The film very smartly edits and merges real life cricketers and match footage with the footage of Sushant Singh Rajput playing Dhoni. In the starting reels, it also shows a young Dhoni with Sushant Singh Rajput looking much younger and also shorter in height. But beyond these technical achievements, one expected better storytelling from accomplished director Neeraj Pandey."
" A film worth watching
",0.2263,0.9092,2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"The film starts with 2011 World Cup finals with Dhoni entering the field to play one of the most crucial innings of his life. The story then goes to the flash back and film begins with the birth of Mahi. The story covers his family background, their aspirations and expectations, Mahi's childhood and adolescence years. What strikes the most throughout the first half is the way every character who has played even the minute role in making of Dhoni- the captain, has been depicted in the film.It doesn't matter if you follow cricket or not as Mahendra Singh Dhoni's journey is inspiring, to say the least. The man comes from a humble background and defied all odds to etch his name in the history of Indian cricket. You'll also get to relive the two World Cup wins under Dhoni's captaincy- those moments will definitely make you chant 'India, India' once again. And you won't be alone!"
" Honest review.
",0.5106,0.9874,2020-05-04 00:00:00,10,"Unbelievable movie, I have no word to Express what I feel after watching this movie,Well I love this movie a lot not only because it is based on life of M.S Dhoni but how much he had struggled to reach this landmark in his life.Even he had lots of problems and obstacles yet he never let himself down and loose his patience.This is not only reflected in his life but also on field too when even in intense pressure situations he has lead his team to historical wins
It's very emotional and motivational movie. They were so poor in early life seriously life is not so easy . His father was a pump operator. He was tc ticket checker .When he brought first bike with his own money he went in dhaba for celebration with his all time supporting friends. After achieving this all he was not satiesfied even he want many more from life and try to bloom his tallent in cricket. He continues his training in cricket. He play many many matches on the behalf of railways and state level. After the this all struggle he got the chance in a indian team.
After that we know Ms dhoni is best captain,player,finisher of in the entire world. Today in this world anyone cannot take place of ms dhoni . ms dhoni we love you a lot . you won the 2nd world cup for india.
It is having everything what we need in a movie fun ,excitement,lesson,motivation and it also teaches us the great support given by teacher and friends.
We indian must got a many poisitive attitude from this movie."

Sushant Singh Rajput is a Perfectionist much better than Ranveer Singh, Nailed the Role Of Most Successful Captain. Best Direction & Songs as well."
" It should have been much better as non biopic
",0.4404,0.9486,2019-12-15 00:00:00,7,Neeraj panday has been making thriller. But this feels like a non biopic movie. Dhoni is so calm and cool. But in the film Sushant Singh acted like extrovert. He didn't had that cool attitude. They should have showed nail biting matches . Cinematography was very weak. Before interval when it rains and a trains arrives chanting Dhoni Dhoni!!!!!!! And he gets inside and becomes cricketer . That same old chamatkar pe chamatkar of bollywood continued. But its worth a watch

If u follow dhoni's crucial International cricket matches and interviews where he talks about his early career etc etc. then u can skip this flick. Flim is trying to portray him some kinda god. Lack of dramatic moments, bad dialogue r the major weak points, like they just shown few moments of final matches of world cups...that is enough? Zero interaction between him and his teammates.. what makes him such a good leader ? But it has time to play same love story scenes again twice . Sushant doesn't resembles to dhoni anyway , neither close to his looks nor his body language, on the other hand guy who play yuvi got those things. Editing done horribly, nearly 30 min can be removed from the movie.

" A Captivating Biopic on Mahendra Singh Dhoni
",0.0,0.9997,2017-06-15 00:00:00,8,"A biopic is incredibly burdensome as a great degree of research is involved in the creative process. Such real stories can completely falter if the actual realities are poorly replicated on the silver screen. In addition, if a biopic does not display key details it doesn't really explore the realities accurately. Biopics can also largely misfire if the actualities are severely distorted. Neeraj Pandey's MS Dhoni: The Untold Story is not a backfire because it does not fall prey to these aforementioned issues. Essentially, it accurately shows MS Dhoni's legacy without spending an overdose of time on needless content; this is no hogwash.This film beautifully shows MS Dhoni's childhood, his passions, and his struggle. This film is several notches above Azhar(2016) because it has an eye for details. Dhoni's family's values are explored well through the initial scenes. In the initial stages, his slow and steady movement towards cricket via wicket-keeping is a delight to watch. His relationship with the Bengali coach is well portrayed with good use of light moments. In this phase, the best moments are when Dhoni gets to bat the first time. Instead of just focusing on his successful hits, the film focuses on the encouragement young Dhoni gets with each hit. The film brilliantly shows how one kid's passion for batting becomes a big hit in that local area in India. It was quite intriguing to see how Dhoni uses numerous cricket tournaments as a window of opportunity to take his game to the next level. However, Dhoni's journey to incredible success was quite arduous. There were no dearth of setbacks in this rocky road to becoming a legendary Indian cricketer. This untold story examines these lows and details Dhoni's reactions through these moments. It was increasingly fascinating to view Dhoni's emotions and how he emerges stronger after each major low in his life. In fact, it was quite interesting to see how calm MS Dhoni was during certain mishaps. For example, Dhoni's calmness during tense moments like missing the flight to the Dilip Trophy was brilliantly presented. In addition, the film splendidly recreates all of Dhoni's major successes including the 2011 World Cup. Ideally, it was increasingly special to view his family witness all his major matches via television. However, the moment that takes the cake is the grand finale which many Indians will love viewing. Basically, the 2011 world cup victory was a big moment and that finale by Dhoni is one that will touch many. Neeraj Pandey (the director of exceptional thrillers like Special 26 and Baby) has proved that he can make great films outside the thriller genre. His direction, screenplay, and dialogue is quite good. He exits his comfort zone and helms a biopic which hooks the audience till the climax. The film has a proper flow despite some unnecessary comedy (which is definitely fun to watch). Essentially, the film works due to a lack of snags. This picture does score in several other creative elements but the director successfully collaborates every element together. Basically, this biopic is a ship which did not sink like other ships because it had a highly skilled captain. If Tony D'Souza directed this film, it would've been far less effective like his Azhar(2016). Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an exceptional performance as Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He gets into the skin of the character and his enormous effort is clearly visible. This character has quite a few layers and Sushant demonstrates them with a high degree of success. In my honest opinion, his best scene was an incredibly difficult emotional breakdown. In this one moment, Dhoni is informed of his special someone's demise and it hits him really hard. Instead of hamming it up badly, Sushant keeps it real and portrays this heartbreaking moment brilliantly. The scenes where he has to juggle between exams and cricket are brilliantly enacted. In fact, you can actually observe the struggle period and his acting makes it more natural. Such moments make his triumphant victories even more beautiful. Disha Patani is sweet as Priyanka Jha and her importance in Dhoni's life is well explored. The beautiful lass underplays her role well. It is such a delight to see her genuine love for Dhoni and her demise is quite agonizing. Kiara Advani doesn't have a big part but she plays a pivotal role in Dhoni's life. Her romantic moments with Dhoni do distract a bit but they are beautiful to view. She has acted well despite the limited screen time; it would be wrong to deem this as a blink and miss appearance. Anupam Kher is excellent as Dhoni's father. His concerns for his son's future are realistic and he enacts these moments effectively. His best moments appear when he watches his sons highs and lows in the big cricket matches. However, his best scene is the finale in which we see his tears of joy for the grand victory. The rest of the cast are all effectively utilized as they all have important moments in the story. Amaal Mallik's music is great with some beautiful songs like Jab Tak and Besabriyaan. Arijit's Phir Kabhi strikes a chord for its lyrics as well as the excellent singing. Chiefly, the music has been beautifully crooned by the numerous musicians involved. On the whole, this is a great biopic which completely deserves all the love it got from the audience. It accurately presents the story of our Indian skipper and it does not shy away from the lows of his career. It is backed up by research and there is no major distortion of facts. Only a director of Neeraj Pandey's caliber could've pulled this off with such a great degree of triumph."
" Justice done by Sushant to such a great personality
",0.8176,0.9432,2017-06-09 00:00:00,10,"What kept going for me to watch this movie and recommend everyone to watch this aspiring documentary is justifying the title of Untold Story. I have watched Dhoni playing in Kharagpur when he was working for Indian railway. Knowing his personality and the way he used to handle pressure even then to those in final moments of World Cup was a daunting task for any actor to match. Sushant did a perfect justice to such a legend. You won't feel that you are watching a movie rather you will feel getting involved in it. This movie depicted that you can make a perfect recipe of success by your determination and your clarity of thoughts irrespective of what kind of imperfections are there in your individual skills. Dhoni might be not the best batsman in world, not the best wicket keeper in world, not the best captain in world when you go by stats but Dhoni is someone who brings the perfect recipe of yielding a result which his fans expect from him for his team.A would say it is a must watch if you want to treat it as a biography or documentary rather a movie."
" Cricket is passion

Its not a movie it is a Motivational thought.Cricket is my passion but in the captaincy of MS Dhoni cricket become my love. So no doubt I am the fan of M S Dhoni. Sushant Singh Rajput played a beautiful role in this movie. people comparing Sushant with Dhoni but please everyone understand Dhoni is Dhoni no one else can get his place.

" The biopic on India's celebrated skipper, Mahendra Singh Dhoni
",0.5719,0.9676,2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"MS Dhoni:The Untold Story is a biographical film, based on the life of Indian Cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni.The movie starring SushantSingh Rajput ,Disha Patani ,Kiara Advani and Anupam Kher is directed by Neeraj Pandey. The Biopic is one of the most anticipated Bollywood Movies of This Year. If you are die-hard fan of MS Dhoni and cricket ,you are bound to love this film, which reverse its protagonist Spread over three hours, Dhoni: The Untold Story takes you through various events and places in the life of ""Mahi"", as everyone calls him in the movie. I have always been a Dhoni admirer. A movie on his life was an emotional, at times almost spiritual experience for me.Most importantly, the movie does not glorify Dhoni but shows him as a near-flawless character. Overall, it is an above-average performance if one looks at it in terms of accuracy and details. It is a simple story with an underlining message that you can be a small town boy but if you have talent and a little bit of luck, you can be unbridled. MS Dhoni:The movie follows the journey of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a budding cricketer from Ranchi, who became the most successful captain of the Indian Cricket Team. He was a ticket collector before he became a cricketer. The movie begins with the ICC Cricket World Cup Final (India vs Sri Lanka) in the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai where Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) is watching the match live on screen. He decides to take the stand, and tells the authorities that he would go for batting if the wicket falls down. Dhoni takes up his bat and leads down the stairs interacted the roar of the crowd.The movie then goes into a flashback in Ranchi, Bihar in 1981, the year Dhoni was born. Dhoni's alleged rivalry with Yuvraj Singh and a few senior players also finds a mention in the film.The Untold Story shows Dhoni's love, struggles, rejections, luck, insights into his personality (including his most used words, definitely and process as well) and his rise in Indian cricket. Barring a minor glitch here and there, the movie manages to keep the viewers interested. The film has its flaws, misses here and there and falls a bit in the 'death overs'"
" Very interesting watch
",0.4576,0.9427,2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,"I wasn't sure how this movie would be. In fact it was an excellent watch, holding the interest throughout.Biopics are not necessarily interesting and every celebrity or sportsperson's saga does not necessarily make for a good story. Dhoni's was superbly depicted, even for those who are not always cricket enthusiasts.The story played out well, the acting convinced, the sets were realistic, cinematography superb.The songs could have been avoided but the makers obviously needed to keep commercial interests in mind.All in all, this was a very good film and well worth watching. It is on hot star."
" We know him as Dhoni, but this is the tale of Mahi.
",0.0,0.9992,2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Usually Indian film fans are divided according to the regions. Because if you turn any corner in that country, there's another film industry, another English alphabet replaced to rhyme with Hollywood. They have got their own bunch of actors, filmmakers and films. They might be divided over films and film productions, but they always united when it comes to cricket.Remember one and a half decade ago an Indian film about the same sport made into the Oscars, but did not win. This film was based on the life of one of the greatest Indian and world cricket player. So length into breadth of the India, it was a highly anticipated sport- biographical film. India has a long history of cricket. It was brought into the country by the British nearly half a millennium ago. It is called a gentlemen's game, which means only rich and royal people can play.So in India, cricket was always been a game highly influenced in big cities. Players from those places are high in demand till recently. Talents from second and third tier cities never been noticed. But some player made it because of political and other sort of influence. That's changed forever when Mehendra Singh Dhoni's success inspired millions of people. Made youngsters to take bat and ball believing someday they can play for their state or in the national team.If you are an Indian, I'm sure you had heard many things about him, his difficult path to stardom. There's nothing much difference in the life journeys of his and Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. They both were ticket sellers/collectors. Struggled through to initiate their profession, but in a different field. Now they're superstars.In Indian films, it's only recently the trend had started in biopics. For a cricketer, it is an ideal initiation. Remember Sachin Tendulkar's documentary film is due to release in this summer, but it is an international project. It can't be neglected because of his hardcore fans, not just in India, but across the world. He had retired a while ago, but still fans chant his name during the recent games.I know this director, since one of his films was remade as 'Someone Like You'. Bollywood films are always very stylish, but slips away while depicting realism of India, Indian society and culture. That's where I lost interest in them. I watched it for MS, since he plays/played for my team CSK who is known as Thala.Seems funny, some of the lines that translated into Tamil. But culture wise, it is understandable. A boy was born on the 7th of July '81, but soon the narration shifts focus on his childhood in the late 80s. A fine football goalkeeper, but changed his sport after an unexpected offer. Extremely interested in batting, but his opportunity was being a wicket keeper.When he enters his teenage, he had learnt to play his own method. Particularly in batting which is the least given privilege to him by his coach. Supportive parents, but from above that, the great friends gang, he had with him at all the good and bad times. The first half is all about the cricket. In fact the whole film was about him and the cricket, the rest of his life was not concentrated enough. I mean on other stuffs, except the romance that takes off during the beginning of the second half. So basically that's where you will come to know this guy is a man with feelings and emotions like you and me.We all knew him as a cricketer, a great cricketer to say. Since his romance parts come into play, for a brief moment the sport was set aside. A love story kick starts. All those who believed he's a superhuman, will come to realise after witnessing Bollywood style of romance, which is basically how happens in real India. He's not an emotion showing type, especially in public or during the game. But there's a scene in the film and when it appears, that's really heartbreaks. No offense, but it looked Sakshi demanded a proposal than expecting it to come her way naturally.I was bothered about the songs, but they smartly merged them with the storytelling. Particularly commercial films can't afford to lose the blue print of Indian cinema, since songs are the free television commercial, to popularise the film prior to its release. All the actors were great. The lead actor was at his best, especially when it comes to the technics in the games to match the Dhoni's style of play. Most of the locations are the actual locations, including the school, grounds and house(s). I think it was a good move.The film was not entirely true. They have changed the events to suit the cinematic. A man's 30 years of life journey to put into a 3 hour film, it has to be done and they did it neatly in Indian style. Some people are complaining about this and that, but that's understandable if you understand the concept of filmmaking, particularly money making film.Only the first two acts were very gripping. The final act was predictable, if you are an ardent cricket follower. Because you know everything on field about this man which is what covered in those parts. And the rest of the film was like behind the scenes of a film called his life. This is a wonder film, and I know the majority of the Indians won't miss it or had already watched it. But for the outsiders, this is not a bad flick, even if you don't know the sport or the player. Worth a try, otherwise definitely recommended.8¬Ω/10"

" Sushant Singh Rajput Delivers His Finest Performance in an Okay Biopic!
",0.2942,0.9943,2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Sushant Singh Rajput's talent comes full circle with 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story'. As the cricket legend, Sushant gives his all in a performance, that comes across as an embodiment, rather than an impersonation. 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' explores the life of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, right from his journey from being a ticket collector, to a trophy collector and the world-cup-winning captain of the Indian Cricket Team.Director Neeraj Pandey chooses a worthy true-story as his latest project, but succeeds only partially. The film is too long at 3-hours & the Writing is never remarkable. Of course, Dhoni is a man made of pure merit, who's seen tremendous struggle, before emerging into a phenomenon. But, 'The Untold Story' has an average Screenplay, that arrests in parts.Pandey & Dilip Jha's Screenplay is alright. Despite choosing to tell the story of a real-life euphoric figure, the Writing never soars. It works in parts & works best when it sees its protagonist off the pitch. Also, the Dialogue are surprisingly weak. Definitely, a much stronger Screenplay was the need of the day! Pandey's Direction is decent. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Music by Various Artists, is melodious.Performance-Wise: Sushant is great, no two options on that! Of the rest of the cast, Anupam Kher is remarkable as Dhoni's father, delivering a genuinely heartfelt performance from start to end. Rajesh Sharma is wonderful as Banerji, who's the first to realize Dhoni's potential. Kumud Mishra excels as well. Bhumika Chawla as Dhoni's Sister is nice & its refreshing to see her on-screen after so long. Kiara Advani as Dhoni's Wife & Disha Patani as Dhoni's Girlfriend, are strictly okay.On the whole, 'M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story' rests on Sushant Singh Rajput's genuine talent to sail through."

",0.0,0.9221,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Ms Dhoni The Untold Story - Is a fantastically made movie which is like two sides of the same coin. The first half which shows why Neeraj Pandey is one of the best directors in the country. While the second half shows why Neeraj Pandey should never make a love story.Sushant Singh Rajput is bloody impressive with his uncanny resemblance to MSD, not just in terms of looks but also the expressions.Anupam Kher, Kumud Mishra, Rajesh & Bhumika are the backbone supporter of this film. Disha Patani looks pretty. Kaira Advani is suitable as Sakshi. Overall a good team in supporter.at last, I am a Dhoni fan but this movie is beyond fans of Dhoni or fans of cricket... For general audience this will be a movie that's not just a treat but also a complete package."

" MS Dhoni The Legend Man
",0.0,0.9833,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"The movie focused really well on the life of MS Dhoni before he became a household name. Sushant Singh Rajput did a great job. He had a challenging role and his hard work showed in the way he projected MSD, in terms of looks as well as expressions. We all only see how a player plays on the ground but we don't want to know his struggle and his hidden story. This movie tells the hidden story of Mr. Dhoni and reveals his actual character. Sushant was absolutely brilliant and flawless in the movie. this movie was not only an entertainer but also keeps you hooked to it for a good three hours. And rarely has a Bollywood movie been this good. There are no secrets to success it is the result of preparation and Hard Work. In last this is the best ever sports based films ever made. I"
" M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is a typical Bollywood but liked the acting of shushant
",0.5719,0.998,2017-01-15 00:00:00,4,"Well people let me tell you something very important about each one of you who comment or posted their replyGood thing to know : 1. Every struggled person who realizes how hard he/she is been through his/her life will certainly make him/her tough and M.S. Dhoni is one of them but lets just admit he has a passion for cricket and so as everyone one of you has a passion for something, difference is if anyone has a guts to follow his passion and achieve all his goals. 2. Well it made me search too on google not because finding how she looks and all but because the girl in the movie acted simple which make us to think this is something sad has happened to someone who is good enough to follow his passion and bring glory to our country. Well i will not talk about human nature over here what people thinks or do at some situation which is what happening over here but if someone told you about it and no movie would have been made then I guess 70% wouldn't have been so sorry about it. 3. Lets just assume that happens 80% of what we have seen in this movie but the producers should have selected the wrong series where both met in 2005 in a flight and India vs Pakistan match was ongoing. Let me tell you the result India(2)- Pakistan(4). India lost that series. Now, quoting dialogue from a movie ""Don't bring anything for Valentine just win the series"". Well if this movie was to make someone inspired then at least producer should have thought about changing the series timeline. 4. My Thinking the movie: Movie was below average and was rushing as if director's or producer's main focus was to show ""There is always a woman in a success of every man"" but I didn't see anything if expand the facts(Losing series). 5. Overall : MS Dhoni for me is a man who made us proud by winning both format world cup. He is not some heart-broken silly person lets be real now. He has a passion for cricket and works hard enough for it. I am not only proud of MS dhoni but I am saluting to all those guys who has a passion and work for it really hard until they get it because I am not that person to have guts like that. His struggle and toughness made him so successful since he had to deal with lots of stupid selectors or Cricket Board. My real life story sucks more than this, the thing is there is no movie made on my life. Now see how following passion gifts you with delights. Go and follow your Dream! Your story will also be shown to the world. **Note **: Now when I say passion or dream this shouldn't had to be like ""I want to be best programmer in my company"" don't lie to yourself, i am not saying this can't be your dream but I know people lie to themselves sometimes and that's where you become the biggest failure more than me. Thank you Guys! Be real Be you!"
