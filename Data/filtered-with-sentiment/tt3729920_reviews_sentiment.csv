" Great haircut
",0.6249,0.2572,2021-02-21 00:00:00,3,"Really, really boring. The most exciting thing to happen here was Jessica Chastain's extreme haircut. Disappointed. Great cast with Chastain and James McAvoy doing their best but the story is just loose and wandering, not interesting, even as a character study its vague. Multiple disjointed flashbacks take us back to when our couple was happy and in love. I think I might have fallen asleep at some point but I'm not sure it would have made any difference. Follows a young couple as their marriage crumbles after the tragic loss of their child and is shown from each of their perspectives as they try to reclaim the life and love they once knew."
" A middling compromise
",0.0,-0.8519,2017-03-20 00:00:00,5,"The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby was originally intended as a movie to be focused on a man's perspective as his wife disappeared out of his life. When writer-director Ned Benson brought star Jessica Chastain on, she asked him about Eleanor's perspective and he was so enraptured with this question that he wrote an entire version of the movie dedicated to her view point of the marriage. The two films were shot simultaneously, but times and audiences being what they are, the distributor cut a third version of the film so that audiences could experience the whole thing in one go. As someone who has seen all three versions of the films (his, her and them) I can tell you this is a mistake. The best way to experience the film is by watching some combination of the Him & Her versions (pick your poison, watching either one first has its benefits and drawbacks, although ""Him"" does start earlier in the timeline than ""Her"").The problem with Them is that it reveals that Rigby is actually a very simplistic movie. It's the story of married couple Connor Ludlow (James McAvoy) and Eleanor Rigby (Jessica Chastain) whose marriage has suffered a devastating blow. Rigby tries to kill herself and when she is unsuccessful she leaves her husband and the two begin separate journeys of discovery. The joy in the Him & Her versions is seeing the different ways the two people experience the same event. Rigby and Ludlow both disappear from each other's narratives for long periods of time posing questions about certain events, questions that get answered when you watch whichever of the two movies you choose to watch first. There's also a handful of scenes that are the same in both stories but the tone and information conveyed is different, showing how people can interpret things differently. All the joy of this is wiped out of the Them version in which everything plays chronologically and we don't get multiple versions of the same scenes. It's an okay movie, but it will leave you wondering what the fuss is all about."
