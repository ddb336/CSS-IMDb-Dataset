" Not the best but not the worst either - middle class
",0.5035,0.9774,2021-03-07 00:00:00,8,"Action without an end and in the next second everything is peaceful and the familie is in the foreground. This line runs through the new movie ""Fast and Furious 7"".Apparently, the balance in between is very well chosen, because why else would this movie so popular.Finally, the family is completely reunited. So there is of course Vin Diesel as ""Dome Toretto"" and Paul Walker as ""Brian OÂ´Conner"" as the two main characters who guide us through the movie. Of course it is also a action movie like the last past.The director of this film was James Wan. The saddest thing is that this is the last movie with Paul Walker because he died. Rest in Peace!Deckard Shaw is looking for revenge on his brother Owen, and doesn't want to let anyone of Dom's crew live. First, he's targeting Federal Agent Luke Hobbs to get information. The mysterious Mr. Nobody offers Dom his help, but not without a return. I want the crew to procure a secret surveillance program whose developer has been kidnapped. Other people are also interested in the programme.I am a huge fast and furious fan. So I am very critical view about the new film. First the good things. I think the film is a really good action film that actually fullfills everything that such a movie must bring with it. It is a great story with gripping scenes and of course an excellent soundtrack. So on the whole, this is an extremly good produced movie. But for me personally the cars play a too small roll because their is a little bit more focus on shooting. Of course thats also a part of fast and furious , but I think the relationship between the two things was much better in the first three parts and much worster in fast and furious 6.Overall I will give the film an 8. out of 10. It is one of the better fast and futious in the last years. I recommended the film for teenager and adults who like cars and action very much."
" Memorable Race
",0.0,0.141,2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,"The Fast & Furious 7 is the best one that I like of franchise of fast & furious from then until now. The franchise of fast & furious called ""The Fast Saga"". Although the fast saga will have many films and many spin-off films in franchise, fast & furious 7 will be the first choice when I want to watch some movies again.
After I watched this movie, I think that proceeding of films is quite good not too slow or not too fast. But started films rather switch to many stories, if you don't seat all the time you might be confused about some character that how did who come. And the point of films is continuation of fast & furious 6 that if you never watch before, sometimes you might confuse about the point of films.
That continuation of the fast saga is attraction to the audience to follow the story of the franchise of the fast saga. Because if you don't watch some films of the fast saga, you will confuse that how did it come, who is he/she etc. Productions of this films is rather exciting for me because most of scene use the car proceeding. When scene that racing car and speed, I feel emotional with it because camera angle is rather realistically it make me excited with it. But some scene is exaggerate such as the scene that release the car from the aircraft to valley that in the real world nobody can do it. I think overall of production is good for me because the fast saga still be the fast saga that still keep the concept as well. This is enchantment of the fast & furious.
Before I watch this movie, I rather to expect that the movie will give me feel very excited and the point continuation of fast 6 because in the trailer of movies have spoilers about connection point about fast 6 and fast 7. But what I got it is more than I expect because some point in the movies come from some part of some movies in the fast saga that I forget it. So, I have to go back to watch it for understand about fast & furious 7 more than before. All of this is small impression after I watch it.
Finally, if you want to try to watch some action movie fast & furious is a good choice to watch it but if you don't like the fight or intensity, you might be passed this movie."

" Three attracting points of Fast and Furious 7
",-0.1531,0.9834,2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"I have saw a lot of movie before like Harry Potter, Transformers, etc. However. The series of Fast and Furious are my recent favorite. I have heard a lot of friends talking about Fast and Furious is an excellent movie series, however, I never watched it until I watched Fast and Furious 7 this summer vacation. I was deeply attracted by its driving skills, actors, and story line of the movie.
First, I want to talk about the driving skill of the movie. The driving skill of the movie can make auditors feel so excited. The protagonist in the movie always drive fast, and when we think they are in danger, they will use their perfect driving skill to pass every danger.
The actors of the movie also is the point. The actors have high recognition, and a lot of people watch this movie just for the actors. When I saw the actors, and I know why people love them. The actors are so handsome and pretty, and you will think they are perfectly fit in these characters. Therefore, that's the second point why I like this movie.
Third, it is about the story line which is full of crime. The protagonist are all criminals, and they keep committing the crime which is so different from what we watched in other movie. This kind of story line can surprise audience and also can catch their eyes.
These three points are the reasons why I love this movie. For its driving skill make me feel excited, the actors are so attracting, and the story line is very special for me. By these points, I am deeply attracted by this movie. I am looking forward what kind of new experience will its new movie-Fast and Furious 9 bring us."
" An exciting and epic experience

On this table are two prescription bottles. A hospital would never let you have access to medication of any kind."
" The Best in the Furious Franchise
",0.128,0.3134,2020-10-25 00:00:00,10,"This one, with its over the top action, international adventure and, of course, fast cars, has an heart wrenching resonance for the fans of the previous films.
Paul Walker tragically passed away during production and that loss is palatable lending the film a very real emotional weight.
A fun thrill ride with poignancy that'll leave even the harshest viewer with a tear in the eye, FF7 is a blast of adrenaline from start to finish.
And the cast is stellar.
Hit the NOX."
" It's good to see so many good women out there.
",0.7003,0.9929,2020-10-01 00:00:00,6,"Every woman that came out of the movie, from the sexy lady in the first race place to the powerful, dynamite bodied queen, were a good women. It was also fun to watch them as they were full of women appearing in what looked like service shots.
However, I had no idea what the story was about. I think this is a movie that only fans of the series and those who love the main character before they see the movie will enjoy. In a stand-alone film, the protagonist is usually set up in a sorry position. It's fair to say that the element of sympathy is essential in order to attract the audience to the protagonist. In the case of the series, the protagonist is the hero, so he doesn't have that situation. In the case of a series, it's important to create a person who has that situation. In this film, the writers seem to have forgotten that. Also, there are too rough details and the way the situation is resolved became boring.
However, this is the kind of movie I want to see. I don't want to see a classy movie. I want to see erotic and wild movies. In that sense, I want to support the direction of this film. I hope the director gets a good script advisor so he can make more interesting ones."

" Escapist fun
",0.5106,-0.8075,2020-08-08 00:00:00,5,"While the three films took place in a pocket universe - yes, I have thought way too much about these movies - between 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Furious 7 was the first movie to make a step toward the future. However, it would have to do so without series star Paul Walker, whose death on November 30, 2013 would make this his last film.After the tragedy, shooting was delayed for script rewrites. Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes and this film served as the end of the story for Walker's character, who retired from the family.This movie also saw Justin Lin leaving and James Wan - who created the Insidious and Saw franchises - coming on board.It also introduced new nemesis Deckard Shaw, brother of the last film's final boss. He's played by Jason Statham and he was so popular - and worked so well with Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs character - that he'd eventually turn good. I don't know how, seeing as how it looked like he killed Han. This movie also introduces Kurt Russell as Mr. Nobody, a government agent who gives a mission to the team that brings them into conflict with Shaw, as well as Tony Jaa's first English-speaking movie and an early role for Ronda Rousey, who made this at the same time as The Expendables 3.The film ends with Dom and Brian going their separate ways, along with a series of clips of Walker's character across the past several films. Yeah - it's pretty emotional.This film more than doubled the carnage - car-wise, that is - with 230 destroyed to make this."
" More over the top slam bang action in Paul Walker's last film
",-0.1372,-0.9536,2020-08-08 00:00:00,5,"Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) is the older brother of villain Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) (incapicitated in FAST AND FURIOUS 6, 2013) and is a Special Ops killing machine who goes after the crew. They are assissting government agents to resuce a hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has been kidnapped by African mercenaries and Shaw is determined to stop them.Usual high octane stuff (much of it CGI of course) with some mostly silly over the top set pieces that you'd expect. Statham does his scenery chewing best as the tough guy villain. If you like big budget over the top action movies, then this one is for you.Regular star Paul Walker died during the making of the film, making the film something of an unfortunate milestone for the franchise. It would be followed by a sequel: F8: THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS (2017)."

" Ugh, no, please get realistic...
",-0.4019,-0.9785,2020-08-05 00:00:00,2,"I'll say it straight out: I HATED this film! From the huge amount of improbabilities, credibility issues, way too much CGI, questionable action sequences and stupid plot (what was the film about again??), I hate this film with a passion.I have a lot of respect for director James Wan, but - sorry to say - 'Furious 7' is by far the worst entry in the series - yes, even worse than 'Fast and the Furious 2'. The opening scene already warned me nothing here was going to make sense, and everything was going to be overblown for effect only - to the point of becoming preposterous. In fact, it was...Jason Statham stars as Deckard Shaw (brother of Shaw from F6, played by Luke Evans). Deckard is an annoying, over-cool character. And Statham is just being Statham again. (I'm beginning to think this guy can't really act and I'm having difficulty telling his films apart, as he always has the same damn character traits. Get a new agent!!).'Furious 7' now plays like a superhero movie. If the series was intended to be fantastical with superheroes, I'd have accepted this, but the series started out with ordinary characters and everyday events. Absolutely everything here happens on cue, and there are way too many coincidences, conveniences, and close calls. Tyrese Gibson once again serves as comic relief, but this time around way more distracting and annoying than funny (not that he ever was!). It ruins every inch of suspense there might have been.There are also way too many characters here, and too many different teams. Eventually the film becomes so confusing that I later didn't care anymore what side the characters were on and who was pursuing who. Oh, and when did our heroes become merciless killers? Yup, they're happily shooting people without blinking - like a John Wick movie (I HATE John Wick movies!!).There are some amazing action sequences, but ultimately it doesn't compensate for the lack of realism, and so CGI-heavy that they're completely forgettable. The scene with the car jumping from building to building was just absurd! With a runtime of around 137 minutes, I found the film at least 30 minutes too long. At times I also forgot about some of the main characters because screen time is divided between way too many characters. I didn't like the film the first time around, and enjoyed it even less the second time. This is a film I want to forget. What was it about again...?? I've already forgotten anyway..."
" So many mistakes..
",0.0,-0.9756,2020-08-04 00:00:00,3,"Don't know where to start but there are so many silly mistakes in this movie. Start off with apparently one bad guy clears his way into a hospital to see his brother, singlehandedly without any marks and killing about 20 cops on the way.. Super hero movie?? I know Fast and the Furious movies have some wild stunts but many of the mistakes, likely the wrong way for this, in this movie are just silly.. Just shoot already! Talking with this bad ass bad guy instead of just ending it. And how did they get out of those towers?? Many of such things in the movie.. Sometimes painful to watch..
Decent action movie that could have been way better with a few tweaks. Enjoyed some of the other movies a lot more."
" the best of the fast & furious saga
",0.128,0.9718,2020-07-02 00:00:00,10,"I love this franchise !!! The action scenes are spectacular, great cast, great performances, good cinematography, good camera work and sometimes funny."
" High stakes, fast cars, exotic spy hijinks
",0.0,0.9093,2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"The seventh installment in the Fast & Furious franchise sees the return of Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) as two mercenaries specializing in fast cars. This time the film begins with them resting on their laurels, but their past exploits are about to catch up with them.Furious 7 is probably the most interconnected of the Fast & Furious films. It really requires you to have seen the previous films, or at least it heavily rewards you having done that. Everything from the individual character arcs to the villain himself are building upon the events of the past films and I bet the film would be rather difficult to follow if you haven't seen them. But that's definitely a point in the film's favour, not a weakness.The film's strengths are those of the franchise. It has style in abundance, most of all. It has fast cars, cool soundtrack, suave characters, great actors, hot chicas, high octane action scenes, spy stuff and the kitchen sink as well. And the addition of Jason Statham to the ensemble cast only strengthened the formula.Regrettably, Paul Walker, one of the two main leads of the franchise, passed away in a car accident during the filming of the film. The film was completed using his two brothers as stand-ins, and if you didn't know that, you absolutely wouldn't notice. The film's script was also reworked a little bit in order to retire Brian as a character, and it's a fitting, touching send-off to a great character. Full marks.I still maintain that Fast Five is my favourite movie in the franchise so far, and after that I'd probably go with the first one, but this one would be a close third."
" Fast and furious 7
",-0.5719,0.9898,2020-06-10 00:00:00,10,"For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie.This is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be ""realistic"" at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can't accept extreme action, they be all like: ""yeah, right, that's SO unrealistic""! Dumb people.Here's what I don't like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he's alright, it's just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he's just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you're into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain't cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.The movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don't totally buy. He's a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he's bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don't buy it.Also there's some other stuff that I didn't like. There's this ""computer chip"" with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.OK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won't let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.There are a couple of 'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!Good thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!And of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you're reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad."

Also in the final scene we see Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) Letty (Michele Rodriguez) Roman (Tyrese Gibson) Tej (Ludacris) Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) sitting on the beach and looking at Brian O'conner with sad looks and it is understood that they are not acting, but their sadness is real and they think back to Paul Walker who died in that terrible car accident.
Finally a song in memory of Paul starts with some scenes of all the episodes where he was present and finally Vin Diesel in the car reached by car by Paul Walker will see one of his brothers, who run together the last race and then their paths divideDuring the filming of this film, Paul Walker died in that car accident and was replaced by Paul's 2 brothers with Paul's face processed on the computer, during the film I noticed from the face when unfortunately Paul was replaced.WE WILL NEVER SEE IT AGAINToo bad that these words recited by Vin Diesel want to make it clear that Paul Walker is unfortunately no longer there and we will never see him again in the next films of this saga.GOODBYE PAUL, WHO FOLLOWED THE FAST & FURIOUS SERIES, WILL NEVER FORGET YOU."

Cars are already great as usual. The action scenes with cars are much more unique than the old series. Paul Walker, on the other hand, plays in the movie as if he is not dead. They did a very good job at making metaphors. They brought integrity to the script. It was good for integrity to put cross sections from Tokyo drift. But what I don't like is that they gave very little role to a guy like Dwayne Johnson in this movie. Unfortunately, Dwayne made little appearance in front of our eyes, as she was hospitalized by kicking a man, slapping, and being hospitalized for a long time."

",0.0,-0.9244,2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"I watched The Fate of the Furious and Hobbs & Shaw without seeing Fast & Furious 7, figuring that it wouldn't matter much since they're all practically the same film anyway: dumb as hell, with extremely silly action sequences, very fast cars, really hot women and indestructible heroes. I wasn't wrong: the plot for 7 is fairly forgettable: the good guys try to stop the bad guys from using a surveillance program that can locate anyone, anywhere on the planet. Meanwhile, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) seeks revenge for his brother, targeting Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team. It's not a particularly imaginative or compelling storyline, but it's the outrageous action that really matters, and director James Wan really goes for broke, delivering some of the craziest big-budget carnage to ever hit the silver screen, never allowing the laws of physics or the mortality of his characters to get in the way of sheer spectacle.As the movie unfolds, numerous expensive vehicles are trashed and buildings are wrecked, but none of the good guys gets so much as a scratch, not even when involved in a high-speed head-on collision or when leaping from a speeding car onto tarmac. None of it is meant to be taken seriously, and those looking for any semblance of realism will be sorely disappointed. Die-hard fans of the series, however, will no doubt love the sight of Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) hurtling from one high-rise penthouse to another in a W Motors Lykan Hypersport (I admit it... I had to look that up) and Dwayne Johnson brandishing a mini-gun. For me, though, the highlights were Tony Jaa (as a mean Thai henchman) kicking ass, and the brawl between Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Abu Dhabi bodyguard Kara (scary yet sexy MMA fighter Ronda Rousey, who should definitely team up with Gina Carano for an action film).7/10, which is how I rated parts 6 and 8 as well."

" Furious 7 (2015)
",-0.5719,0.9225,2019-12-07 00:00:00,5,"Directed by James Wan. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Tyrese Gibson, Dwayne Johnson, Nathalie Emmanuel, Kurt Russell, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Elsa Pataky, Ronda Rousey, Tony Jaa. (PG-13)The gearhead gang is back once again (excuse me, ""family""), this time taking turns pursuing and being pursued by the brother (Statham) of the last baddie they took down. The street racing component is limited to a single brief scene at the beginning; the rest of the time, they're just IMF with hotter cars and smaller vocabularies (an undercover heist at a party in Abu Dhabi feels at times like a plagiarism of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise). If the last few outings were really dumb, this one is just plain stupid--raucous fun in fits and bursts, but too long, too over-the-top, too overstuffed, with flashy but pointless camera movements masking a firm sense of space, geography and logic. Less mayhem would have been a good thing, none of Gibson would have been a great thing. A few familiar faces make brief appearances, but the real stars will always be the cars and stunts; it's just a shame that so many of those stunts are too obviously staged/digitized and too physically impossible to legitimately thrill. Johnson is sidelined for most of the movie, but his bicep flex during the climax is one for the ages. Walker's final film, and the fitting farewell that caps the film is handled with surprising sensitivity.47/100"
" The stupidest one of the series!
",-0.5707,-0.917,2019-11-29 00:00:00,3,"James has an amazing talent, and he used it to create one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Now, visually, he manages to create some beautiful shots, and some of his action sequences are really great, in the ridiculous and beyond over the top and physics kind of way the franchise turned into. But I have to blame him for making a movie that chose the easiest and dumbest turn every time something remotely interesting or surprising could've happened. And also for the atrocity of the intro, which is basically an MTV music video.But that takes me to the writing. Not untalented, because I really like how they, movie after movie, manage to connect the whole franchise. But as soon as they have to write the dialogue and exposition, they turn into the worst. This might be related to the fact that the lead actors are atrocious, but still.But that takes me to the acting. How can I only blame the writers when they can't expect even one good/decent acting scene from the cast (other than Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson). Vin Diesel's acting is regressing from a very low point. The same is happening with Michelle Rodriguez. The rest never had any potential.Whatever. The movie is terrible, it takes itself way too 90's seriously while they have cars flying in the next scene. It's a mess and a waste of James Wan."

It is touching where it needs to be and badass where it should be.
Furious 7 blends action and drama in a wonderful way. It is a beautiful end to Brian O'Conner's saga. A person can't help but tear up during the end scene which acts as a tribute to Paul Walker. It is 110% worth the 2 hours and 20 minutes to watch."

However, that's part of the appeal I suppose, to watch something that could never happen in real life. Number 7 is a decent flick, and I don't have too many complaints. I'd say my biggest gripe is with Tyrese Gibson's character, Roman. Why is he even in these films? I know he's supposed to be the comic relief, but honestly, do you think a professional team would keep a guy that does nothing but whine and complain, and can't even offer any benefit to the team besides being an annoying, loud-mouthed braggart? It's silly to think that above everything, high flying stunts included, that's the part that's hardest to believe for me.RIP Paul Walker.

And it is, as the lasts chapters, an anonymous action movie that on a side lost all his race characteristics (supercars are introduced just as a spectacular elements, without an unchangeable role in the plot) and on the other risks to lose itself in the sea of mediocre action movies. The introduction of Jason Statham confirms officially this evolution as before did the entrance of Dwayne Johnson. And in fact the movie is full of long, predictable fights with or without arms where those that in the firsts film were pilots now are kind of ninja or 007: I really don't understand how Dominic Toretto can raise a car just with his hands or destroy the street with the foot.In conclusion, the movie is a sufficient action, that forgets the most part of its supercar movie and concentrate all its efforts producing a commercial ""sparatutto"", with all the negative points of a entertaining movie (bad dialogues, annoying irony, superficial characters etc)."

" A Good Sendoff To Paul Walker
",0.4404,0.9901,2019-08-17 00:00:00,7,"Furious 7 is a solid entry in the Fast and Furious franchise but it's, by no means, spectacular. I know you shouldn't expect too much from one of these movies, but, while, I liked and had fun with the film, I still think it's not on the same tear as the previous two movies. This is now the highest-rated movie of the franchise on Rotten Tomatoes and I don't think it warrants that. While I can definitely say I enjoyed this more than the first four installments I think it not as good as Fast Five or Six. The story has two main faults that put it bellow those films for me.The film does many things right. It is a lot of fun despite by grips with it. Vin Diesel and the rest (for the most part) reprise their roles here and they do a pretty good job. The effects, like in the last two films are very well-done as well.I also love what they did in the end. I loved the tribute to Paul Walker at the very end. It was sweet and served as a nice send-off too him. I'm glad he went out on a fairly high note. I didn't even notice it was his brother doing many of Paul's scenes. Whether it was the effects or the way it was shot, they did a good job in that regard.The action is a lot of fun as insane as it is. I warn you will have to suspend your disbelief immensely to enjoy the action here. This took the over-the-top nature that the previous films had and intensified it to the tenth power. The action seems to get crazier with each film. However, despite it was still highly entertaining. This film might have the most and greatest action scenes of all the movies; even Fast Six.However, as I stated before I have two major problems. One is that the film seems very unfocused. The previous films all had a simple structure and a basic singular goal. In this movie it starts out with Jason Statham's character hunting Toretto and the group. However, then it shifts to this completely out-of-nowhere plotline regarding the God's Eye and Djimon's character for the entire middle portion and Statham gets put on the backburner. Statham occasionally shows-up to remind us he's in the movie but not much focus is given to him.Statham should have been the main villain and focus. He's the more interesting villain and one presenting the most personal conflict for the heroes. It's like they needed this other plot just to give the rest of the cast something to do and to show more over-the-top fights. Instead he's played as more of an afterthought for most of it which is my second big problem. Also the way he gets beaten is extremely underwhelming as well. Kurt Russell is there but he doesn't get to do much either. That is more of a minor grip but it irked me.Overall, Furious 7 is an entertaining film with some great action. If you like Vin Diesel and the rest of the Fast crew (except Han) you won't be disappointed. I don't think it's as good as the previous few installments but still found it serviceable and a good send-off for Walker. If you like this series then check this out."

" Furious 7
",-0.5719,0.9466,2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Amongst the hype of the death of the incredible Paul Walker, James Wan and his crew managed to pull off the brilliance that was the seventh installment of the Fast and Furious Franchise (Styled as Furious Seven.) On a whole, the franchise started out as a small-time, home-bound film regarding street racing and yet as it progressed, the franchise developed into an international action genre, that worked in favor for the films. For this one in particular, (Furious Seven) it was an excellent action-packed film peaked with fury and yet well-rounded off with a touching tribute in honor of a fallen comrade. And I guess that because these films taught the significance of family and substance in loyalty it was absolutely shattering as the movie came to end, signifying that so did the life and career of Paul Walker, and the legacy he left behind in the character of Brian O' Conner. On the other hand, in terms of screenplay and layout of the film, the special effects and action sequences were very much over the top bringing vast entertainment and a unique feel to the highly grossing and thrilling ride viewers take along with the cast. Rest In Peace Paul Walker."

Not only was it ridiculously absurd many times, the action in general wasn't even done well. lots of shaky cam. the fights were hard to follow and didn't flow well with the different battles like they did so flawlessly in the others. You can easily tell it was directed by a different person. I looked up his previous movies he directed and most of them were horror films, including the first Saw. it tried to take itself too seriously and get too emotional. the rock was barely in it. that along with the characters they previously lost made this team a lot less fun than the last two. also in previous ones, everyone had their roles, with some overlap. in this one, everyone could fight and shoot. Statham was awesome as a villain but was very underused. And the other villain was stupid (2 viewings)"
" Living life in the Fast Lane
",0.0,0.9817,2019-06-03 00:00:00,9,"Fast and Furious 7 is an action-packed movie that will get your on the edge of your seat, make you laugh, and drive all your attention into the movie screen. After watching Fast and Furious 7 I couldn't help but feel the need to go do something dangerous the adrenaline rush this movie gives you is unlike any other. The feeling that you cheated death just by watching the movie is absolutely remarkable. There are many scenes in this movie that give me this feeling but the two stand out the most are when Brain (Paul Walker) gets trapped in a bus sliding off a cliff and he runs up the bus as its going off the edge and grabs hold to Letty's (Michelle Rodriguez) spoiler on her car. Although some of the CGI in this particular scene looked a little unrealistic the focus was more on Brain and did no the effect the power and meaning of the scene. And the other is when the crew backs their cars out of a flying plane and parachute down to a small mountain road. This was absolutely insane to watch as they had real footage of them dropping these cars out of a plane.
The whole plot of the movie was dealing with the kidnap of Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) over a surveillance device that can use any camera or microphone to find anyone and anything within minutes called God's Eye. Finding the chip to this device leads them all over the world including Dubai where Dom drives a 3.4 million dollar supercar, the Lykan hypersport, which contained the chip through three buildings tens of stories in the air. During all of this Brian's wife is kidnapped and they are forced to hand over the God's eye chip. With the chip in the wrong hands they now have to have Ramsey hack the system but the only problem is is that the bads guys with the chirp and in a helicopter and she needs to be within one mile for the hack to work. They basically play hot potato with Ramsey in cars while being shot at from above until the hack is complete. They then blow the chopper out of the sky in a dramatic car jump grenade shot. They recover God's Eye and the security of the world is restored.
This is the director's, James Wan, first action movie as he was more formally known for his work in the horror industry. But it's safe to say he nailed this and I would hope to see him creating more action movies in the future. Wan did a great job giving the movie an intense feel the whole time except when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) who is the crew's jokester/ladies man that lightens the mood would speak up. Roman never failed to make me laugh and is an essential part of the movie to create a more well-rounded crew. Although some of the stunts were a tad far fetched, that's what I would have hoped to expect from a Fast and Furious movie, it's what keeps us coming back for more. I also cannot say enough good things about the soundtrack to this movie I personally have downloaded over half of the songs from this movie and listen to them all of the time. And finally, my favorite part about this movie was the tribute to Paul Walker at the end. Paul has been a huge part of the Fast and Furious movies and his character Brian is more important than any other character in these movies. The tribute Wan gave to him was very respectful and brought tears to my eyes as well as many others. Overall this was a great action movie with a lot of different elements that are entertaining for everyone. It is a movie I would highly recommend seeing and a fun movie for people of all ages."

Well in an effort to binge this franchise I finally watched it. So far my favorite of this series has been Tokyo Drift and Fast 5 but Furious 7 holds it's own. The makes of this franchise know what people want to see and this delivers even more of it. The action is non-stop, the stunts are ridiculously insane and the characters are over the top macho versions of themselves. The ending was also a very sweet memorial to Paul Walker. Jason Statham makes for an incredible villain that I actually think they underused just a little bit but he still is great in his role. Vin Diesel is exactly what everyone wants him to be in the film and he is great at it. I don't particularly see why this instalment seemed to be so massive compared to the others but then I also get at an enormous run time and the scope of the action that this is as close to action-epic as you get. It was definitely a fun watch and gets the adrenaline pumping and is anything but boring. I also think previous cast members Gal Gadot and Sung Kang were definitely missed as well and Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson were underused. Still, consider me a fan of the series and this one was a must see on that list! 8/10"

Furious Seven is no exception here: we have a fast, outrageous and crazy action film that f###s the laws of physics in beautifully stupid ways, but at least it's memorable and HONEST stupidity, unlike Michael Bay's movies which fail in embracing that investing stupidity. Director James Wan knows that he's doing a movie that's basically Looney Tunes mixed with 80s-90s action-movies such as Speed, and he freaking loves what he's doing. Vin Diesel is having a ball and so is The Rock, Paul Walker (who died during production), Jason Statham and even 80s-mainstay Kurt Russell (who freaking owns every scene he's in). So get prepared for the movie-equivalent of a ready-to-eat meal and turn your brain off; it's cinematic bliss that relishes in its over-the-top nature.Furious Seven gets a rock-solid 4/5 stars."

",0.1027,0.9847,2018-03-05 00:00:00,3,"Watched this the other night, and I can't believe all the good reviews it is getting. I just oon't get it. I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece, I knew full well going in this was going to be a car chases and explosions thrill ride sort of movie. Well, we got the car chases and explosions, but for me there was no thrill ride. I found most of the stunts visually uninspired and boring, and in spite of usually being able to turn off my brain and go with it, in this case I spent most of my time shaking my head in disbelief. This was so over the top it made old episodes of The A-Team look like a documentary. It wasn't so bad I stopped watching, but the thought did cross my mind. To all the ""it is so bad, its good"" folks, I usually like that sort of movie, but I don't think this one fits the bill, and since I enjoyed Crank 2 I think that says plenty enough. If you dig it, more power to you; if you haven't been following the franchise, go re-watch the Transporter or anything else for your car chases and explosions fix and give this one a pass. A certain amount of hoak and cheese can be fun, this was just too much for me, and I'm not the only one."
" Best Fast & Furious movie to date.
",0.128,0.0219,2018-03-05 00:00:00,9,"When I say this is the best F&F movie so far, and yes even better than Fast Five. I mean it. Furious 7 rarely fails to entertain me at any point in the movie despite numerous viewings. That's how good it is. Everything from the action to the complete absurdity of it all is cranked up a notch. As only Fast & Furious knows how to do. Although, Dom slamming his foot onto the ground and having it collapse beneath him is a little ridiculous even for Fast & Furious.With Furious 7 you also have arguably the second best villain in the franchise in Deckard Shaw. Right behind Hobbs if you go with the notion that he was a villain in Fast Five. Who's sorely missing for most of this movie by the way. As for Jason Statham's performance here it's very reminiscent of a lot of his past roles. So if your a fan of him like I am you'll love him here.Finally, we all know this is Paul Walkers last outing as Brian O'Conner and I think that's why I cherish this movie so much more. Knowing that Brian is never going to gear up with the gang again is a hard pill to swallow, but seeing how nice a sendoff they give Paul makes it all the easier to bare. That's why I give this movie a 9 out of 10 if only for some of the stuff being a little too ridiculous even for Fast & Furious standards."

Soundtrack was great.The entire film is worth a watch If you love fast cars, action, and a movie that has no dry times I would highly recommend not only checking out this movie, but also check out the whole series. The characters in the movie knows how to stay loud and proud after Paul Walker passed away, but on the other hand familiar faces from past Fast&Furious films appear in this movie and that is great how Chris Morgan and James Wan did to make this movie all about the Fast & Furious family. The ending did get me all teary eyed with it's poetic tribute to Paul Walker, a perfect sendoff which fans will appreciate. If you like action films,""Fast and Furious 7"" will not disappoint you.

",0.6124,0.9707,2017-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Furious 7: Movie Review.Furious 7 is a film with little bit taste and touch of Humor and it is also sad and emotional too at the same time. Some Action Sequences are good and well executed. James Wan Direction is good.The fight sequences of the movie are well directed as well as well performed. The performances are enjoyable. Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Kurt Russel, along with rest of the cast are amazing in their respective characters. Story is not so great but visually its thrilling till the end. As for Paul Walker and his performance, he is charming as ever. It makes me sad and emotional that I have watched a last performance by him. It makes me emotional to say that this film marks the final appearance of one of my most favorite character of this series, Paul Walker. His performance in the movie is above all and its emotionally touching. The Tribute and Honor to him at the end of the movie is very emotional and touching and very well directed to say goodbye and farewell to one of the legendary character of the Furious series- Paul Walker- Brain O' Connor.Fast and Furious will Never going to be the same.--For Paul---Thank you Paul Walker for Entertaining Me. You Will be always in my heart and in my memories. You will always going to be one of my most favorite character in Fast and Furious films for all time. Furious 7 is the movie which always going to be close to my heart because of Paul Walker.All over, Furious 7 is a good movie.

" Good Fun and a Paul Walker tribute
",0.7351,0.6361,2017-09-24 00:00:00,8,"Fast and Furious 7 takes action to the next level from Fast and Furious 6, a notch higher. Keeps your adrenaline pumping for more action as the movie goes on. The mix of fast paced action, and heartbreaking emotion keeps you on the edge of your seat, whilst Dom and his crew drive cars out the back of a plane thousands of meters above the earth and Letty starts to remember her past.Acting is excellent for most characters, Jason Statham particularly brilliant. However he does not receive enough screen time, as, understandably, more screen time is given to Paul Walker, leading up to the final farewell. Vin Diesel does his thing, being a badass with no emotions. Every action sequence just had to be filled with at least one moment of something happening and the actor tried to be funny and every person in the audience chuckling to themselves about it. The action scenes are supplemented by smart-alecky dialogue, good sentiment and endless corny homilies about the value of camaraderie and family."
" Furious 7
",-0.5719,-0.8718,2017-09-03 00:00:00,7,"This seventh entry in the non-stop high-octane franchise became one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, it is dedicated to the memory of its star Paul Walker, who tragically died in a car accident halfway during production, I was hoping for a suitable tribute, and a great film, directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring). Basically following the defeat of Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), and past crime pardoned, Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel), former FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the rest of their team have returned to America to live normal lives again. Brian is enjoying being a father, while Dom is trying to help returned lover Leticia ""Letty"" Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen Shaw is in a coma, his older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) swears vengeance against Dom and his team. Shaw next breaks into the office of DSS (Diplomatic Security Service) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) to extract profiles of Dom's crew, he and Hobbs fight, Shaw escapes after detonating a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom learns from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) that she is pregnant again, he convinces her to tell Brian, but Dom is called by Shaw, who is in Tokyo, Japan, he detonates a bomb that kills team member Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang). Dom visits Hobbsijn hospital, he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother, Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, he also meets with and races Han's friend Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), who gives him personal items found at the crash site. At Han's funeral in Los Angeles, Dom notices a car observing them, after a chase he catches the driver, it is Shaw, they prepare to fight, but Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire. The team are led by Frank Petty aka Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), he offers to help Dom in stopping Shaw, if he helps him to obtain God's Eye, a computer program that can use any digital device to track down people and turn a device into a weapon, and they must save its British hacker creator Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a mercenary named Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou). Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), and Tej Parker (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) airdrop their cars over the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, they ambush Jakande's convoy and rescue Ramsey, she tells them she gave the flash drive containing God's Eye to a friend in Abu Dhabi. The team there and find the friend, Safar (Ali Fazal), who has sold the drive to a a billionaire, this leads the team to a party where they plan to get it back, they escape after Letty fights with Kara (Ronda Rousey), the Head of Security for the billionaire, and Dom and Brian use a fast car, with brakes damaged and crashing through the near buildings. The team use God's Eye to track down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory; Dom, Brian, Petty and his team attempt to capture him, but Jakande and his men ambush them, they flee and Jakande obtain God's Eye. Petty requests to be evacuated by helicopter when he is injured, Brian and Dom continue without him, the team have no choice but to pursue Shaw, Jakande and his men to Los Angeles, meanwhile Brian calls Mia, she tells him about her pregnancy, he promises he will retire and fully dedicate himself dedicate to her and their children, once they deal with Shaw. Brian and the team are pursued by Jakande in a stealth helicopter, and with an aerial drone, Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye, Hobbs watches the team in trouble on the news, he leaves the hospital, and eventually catches up, to destroy the drone with an ambulance. Ramsey regains control of God's Eye and shuts it down, Brian engages Jakande's team member Kiet (Tony Jaa) and kills him when he falls down an elevator shaft.

Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead, Letty cradles him and reveals she has regained all her memories, including their wedding day, Dom regains consciousness, simply saying ""It's about time."" Shaw is taken by Hobbs to a secret high security prison; Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe Brian and Mia playing with their son, they acknowledge Brian is better off retired with his family. In the end, Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he's going to say goodbye, Dom says, ""It's never goodbye."", but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad, as Dom remembers the times he had with Brian (with flashbacks from the previous films), they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions. Also starring Elsa Pataky as Elena, Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot as Gisele and singer Iggy Azalea as Female Racer. Diesel delivers as the team leader, Walker gives a good final performance, his remaining scenes completed by younger brothers Caleb and Codym and brilliant CGI, there is good banter between the supporting cast, and Statham is a suitably nasty villain. The majority of the films have been more style over substance, thankfully this has a well crafted story, especially the moving and fitting goodbye to Walker, featuring the brilliant chart-topping and Golden Globe nominated ""See You Again"" by Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth (which overtook ""Gangnam Style"" as the most watched video on YouTube). Obviously there are the over-the-top moments that border on ridiculous (cars dropping from the sky and parachuting), but you can't complain with the many cool cars, and exciting stunts, chases and explosions, a really entertaining action thriller. Very good!"
" One last ride - not a bad action flick i like it
",0.6542,0.7766,2017-08-15 00:00:00,9,"A really good movie and not a bad action movie I really like it, the whole gang is here. Fast Five (2011) is still to me the best one and my favorite in the franchise and then it would be Furious 6 than The Fast and the Furious I think this would be my fourth favorite film in the franchise. It is an entertaining fun fast paced action film and that really a good one. But it is not perfect I have issues with the film which I will get to it but first I want to write goods about this film.I can't wait till I watch The Fate of the Furious I am getting on Blu-ray next week so yesterday I re-watch this film and I have enjoy it. Furious 7 is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the sixth highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide â more than the franchise's first five installments combined â making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released on April 14, 2017.The film's about Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. The cast includes: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. I like this flick they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces. Kurt Russell is in this and like I have said in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 my review I hated his performance in that movie but in here I loved him he was awesome and a really good guy and likable. He has more to do in this film than he did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is always terrific and a bad-ass I absolutely love him. Jason Statham is a crazy motherf***** in this I have enjoyed him I always wanted Statham as a bad guy. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz Dom's girlfriend was hot as always I have simply enjoyed her. The rest of the cast was alright.The issues with the film I have is: Why is shaky cam in the beginning of the fights between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham and on the end of the fights between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that really hurts this film. I got a migraine because of the shaking cam.Dwayne Johnson was only in the beginning of the film and for the rest of the film he was departure he appeared only on the end of the film in the final showdown I only wish he would be more in this film and he would have more to do but I still have enjoyed his performance awesome. Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto is useless in this movie she doesn't do nothing her character is just wasted and useless. I don't know why they put her character in this movie. Lucky Michelle Rodriguez fulfill the emptiness in Dom's crew. Car's with flying parachutes also doesn't fit in the film because of the metal weight parachutes can't hold that kind of metal and some unnecessary CGI was used in this film that also hurt the movie. Those are all the issues I have, I can't wait for The Fate of the Furious to see it I heard it is a good film.The rating this film get's is a A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but those issues in my opinion hurt the film. Paul Walker died in November 30 2013 so his two brothers Caleb and Cody Walker replaced him and they help to make this film right so I have enjoy from all three brothers performance. R.I.P. Paul Walker my favorite actor and my all time favorite character of the franchise Brian O'Conner. This film is dedicated to his memory which I love.

" Business as usual
",0.0,-0.7682,2017-07-20 00:00:00,6,"Another year, another FAST & FURIOUS movie, this one standing out as being the last to feature Paul Walker due to his untimely death in a car accident (what else?). As such the film plays out as a tribute to the actor of sorts, particularly at the climax, and it's occasionally distracting to see his role completed by old clips, stand-ins, and CGI. The rest is business as usual.Having hospitalised Luke Evans in the last movie, this new film sees Jason Statham on the rampage and seeking revenge on our team. He begins the film by putting The Rock in traction before crossing wits with the normal crew in a variety of exotic locations including the UAE. This film is overlong and features a variety of drawn-out sequences which are completely unbelievable for anyone with a basic understanding of the laws of physics; the writer seems obsessed with having cars flying through the sky, a theme which pops up time and again.Fans of the series will know what to expect by now and this is very much in the spirit of the previous instalment. There's a stand-out multi-vehicle car chase which is a real highlight along with some tough fight scenes and a lot of CGI heavy explosive action. Statham is on great form even as villain and he does show Vin Diesel up when he appears. Newcomers include Nathalie Emmanuel and Kurt Russell, who are both welcome presences. Best of the lot is my personal favourite Tony Jaa, who has more to do than in the recent XXX: RETURN OF XANDER CAGE."

It would have made more sense to have The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift directly precede Furious 7 instead.Anyhow, I thought Kurt Russell was an excellent choice for playing ""Mr. Nobody"" in this latest film. It was poignant watching some of the scenes with the late Paul Walker, and at the end of the movie something must have gotten into my eyes. With the return of the major cast members, Furious 7 delivered the goods that made the series so popular and injected some nitrous. Someday, I'm going to have watch all seven movies back-to-back--but in the right order."

",0.0,0.8848,2017-06-13 00:00:00,6,"Granted that I can't claim to be a fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" series, but still have managed to gotten around to watching them all whenever the chance presented itself. Though this is definitely not movies that will lure me to the cinema. It took me about two years after its initial release to get around to watching ""Furious 7""; yeah, these movies are not high on my to-watch-list.""Furious 7"" was every bit as I had expected, which wasn't much. Sure, there is an abundance of cars and action here, which is essentially the only thing that the franchise is about.Story-wise, then ""Furious 7"" was every bit up to par with the previous six movies. So if you enjoyed those previous movies, you will also enjoy this one. Just don't expect storytelling on a grand scale.Personally I can't claim to have any interest in Vin Diesel or his inability to act and his monotone delivery of every single line. However, Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez is what I enjoy watching in this franchise. The cast is actually quite alright, and has been so throughout the entire franchise. It was quite nice to have Tony Jaa and Kurt Russell show up in ""Furious 7"".There is a lot of action and cars in the movie, as I mentioned earlier. Personally I don't care much about cars in any way or fashion, so that has little appeal to me. The action, however, now that was top notch. Actually, some of the scenes were just so over the top and campy that it was hard not to laugh at how ludicrous of it all was. I mean, the scene where Dwayne Johnson breaks off his cast and goes to pick up a Gatling gun to take on a helicopter was just too much. I was actually ready to turn off the movie when they dropped out of an airplane in their cars and almost all of them practically managed to land spot on the road, that was just downright ridiculous. And finally the scene where they had a car jump through three buildings was also seriously too much.""Furious 7"" is definitely a movie made for the male audience, so it is filled with testosterone, cars and action.While it certainly is an entertaining movie, it is also a movie that you shouldn't take too seriously, because it is just blown way out of proportions and lacks a sense of realism. ""Furious 7"" is hardly a groundbreaking movie by any means, but proved to be just as entertaining as the previous six movies in the franchise."
" Great Send-Off to Paul Walker (1973-2013)
",0.6249,0.9982,2017-06-04 00:00:00,8,"Since its fruition in 2001, the ""Furious"" movies has been a high octane franchise that churns out exciting adrenaline-pumping action mixed with colourful characters and intense story-lines. The first of the series had a ""Point Break"" thing going for it. The second one was a letdown due to Vin Diesel's absence, but it was still exhilarating. ""Tokyo Drift"" was the worst of the bunch. The forth one was great the Vin Diesel and Paul Walker came back and came into the idea of adding fast cars action with espionage James Bond themed stories and since then it has never looked back. The series from 4-6 had shifted gears towards action films very reminiscent to popular movie franchises of the 1980's and 1990's and each film was played solely from the heart, which is a good thing, because never once does it feel forced, doesn't insult your intelligence and not played for cheap thrills. ""Furious 7"" follows that trend like the 4-6 of the series only this time instead of jumping for joy in excitement, I was in tears of joy because the movie was well made, but tears of sadness as this was Paul Walker's last film before his tragic death.To be frank, I was a little hesitant of seeing ""Furious 7"". I was scared, that this film was just there to cash in another franchise just for the sake of it. I also thought that Paul Walker's death would be too much heavy-cargo for me to sit there and realize that I'm watching an underrated performer to never grace the big screen again. Another thing that made me hesitant was that Justin Lin was not coming back this time around to direct. And though James Wan was great in his directing debut in the franchise, we see that action is not the genre of his craft. Granted there was some great usage of slow-motion captures and Wan seems at ease with the ""Wan-cam"", but still many times the editing of the action can be a bit rusty and sloppy and the close cuts and the zooms make the action hard to follow at times. It's still ten times better than ""Taken 3"", but the scenery is opaque and indecipherable at times. There are some really cool moments like when Brian O'Connor's (Walker) speeding down the transport and was about to fall to his demise, but was successfully rescued in Letty Ortiz's (Michelle Rodriguez) car. Sadly, the action scenes are not in the same league as series 4-6. The showdown was a bit of a disappointment, the drone fiasco left very little impression because I was more excited about an epic showdown between Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). It truly pales in comparison to ""Fast 6"" where the entire swat has his and her time to shine. Although she was best thing to happen in ""The Expendables 3"", I thought Rhonda Rousey was badly wasted here as a Head of Security to an Abu Dhabi billionaire.Even though the action was not up to par from the series 4-6, it was still very character driven. It was great to see Walker and Diesel go at one more time for one last ride. Dwayne Johnson was Luke Hobbs shows why he's valuable asset to the franchise. Michelle Rodriguez shows she one of the toughest action film stars out there and it's a pleasure watching her kick butt. Jason Statham is by far one of the best villains in the franchise in hopes he plays more villainy characters in the near future. And even though I may have been a bit down on the action, it's still fun to watch in all its over-the-top imagination. The pacing is executed briskly up to bring some action and character develop,meant. Very entertaining and a nice swan song for Paul Walker. The last five minutes of the movie were very emotional and it was handled in a very crisp, tender moment and the epilogue to O'Connor was fulfilling and very well executed. Even though there are more sequels to come, there's part of me that wished this film would end the franchise because the ending was so perfect. After the credits rolled I really left the theatre satisfied given I was entertained, engaged and filled with tears in both joy and sadness as O'Connor drives his fast-car into the heaven's above."

" Powerful, Emotional and one enjoyable ride; Would Recommend
",0.8316,0.9993,2017-05-17 00:00:00,7,"Directed by James WanStarring Vin Disel, Paul Walker and Jason StathamPlot Overview: âSoon after his brother was crippled by Dominic Torretto(Vin Disel)'s crew, Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) seeks revenge and tries to seek out those who harmed his brother.This movie is not only a powerful tribute to the guy who started this entire franchise, but is also an immensely enjoyable popcorn flick that succeeds without the burden of handling Paul Walker's death. I applaud James Wan and the rest of the crew for managing to make a movie incredibly enjoyable yet also incredibly upsetting. Wan had the burden of making a standard F&F popcorn flick but on top of that saying farewell to Paul and he did it in such a beautiful way that he must be applauded for that. Even without the heartbreaking tribute at the end, this movie stands on its own two feet as an immensely enjoyable popcorn flick and could have ended the franchise in the best way possible.Half of this story was a by the numbers revenge story about Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) hunting down those who crippled his brother. While this arc was done pretty well, it pales in comparison to the other half of the movie which was attempting to bid farewell to Brian O'Connor/Paul Walker. I think that this half of the movie was flawless and really pulled at your heartstrings. The ending was also incredible and genuinely heartbreaking which is the first time a movie like that has drawn genuine emotion from me. It was(and should have been) the perfect way to end this franchise. Alas they didn't end it here but that is another matter entirely.It's very hard to comment on what was Paul Walker and what wasn't but regardless the character of Brian O'Connor was played very well and you could really feel emotion conveyed through it. Vin Disel was alright as Dominic Torretto but I think that the emotion he emitted was genuine which is actually heartbreaking, and I don't want to even think about going through that, but it doesn't necessarily prove his worth as an actor. Jason Statham is the the God of War incarnated. He is a living metaphor for badass and he really shines in this movie. That said, I think they could have done so much more with his character. Granted, Deckard Shaw was easily the best villain this franchise has ever had but I think they built him up to be this unstoppable force but then he only had one or two scenes that were genuinely noteworthy. Another great thing is that every character's actions is in someway justified. Vin Disel has Han's death to motivate him and Jason Statham has Owen Shaw's disability to do so. Aside from the main actors, everyone else does fine from Michelle Rodriguez to Kurt Russell but none of them really stood out. I would also have liked to see a LOT more Hobbs because he was the reason this franchise became what it is today.From a technical standpoint, this movie is pretty good. The cinematography is pretty nice and it looks very good. Some of the effects(such as the Dubai sequence) looked awesome whereas others(such as the house sequence) looked unbelievably fake and awful.As far as I'm concerned, this movie needed to provide fun action sequences and bid farewell to Paul Walker in a powerful way. This movie achieved both. They handled each aspect of it so magnificently and beautifully that it was just a treat to watch. 'When I see you again' is an amazing, heart wrenching song that I wholeheartedly believe should have won the Oscar. As a side note(and if you haven't watch the movie you should stop reading now), I would have made one alteration to the end of this movie. In the scene where Brian and Dom and driving down the road as a tribute to Paul Walker, I would have liked them to have both the characters be driving the cars they drove at the end of 'The Fast and the Furious'. If you can't remember them cars, then here is a link http://img1.rnkr-static.com/list_img_v2/192/280192/870/the-fast-and- the-furious-cars-u4.jpg . While it may not have need to happen, I think that doing that would have been a beautiful send off to Paul Walker and would have ended the franchise in a flawless manner.In conclusion, this movie is a very enjoyable popcorn flick that also has a powerful tribute and message so I do recommend that you see it.7/10Would Recommend"
" Fast & Furious 7
",-0.5719,0.1713,2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"After the events in 'Fast and Furious 5' where Dominic Toretto and his friends defeated terrorist Owen Shaw in London they thought they could finally relaxÂ they didn't count on Owen's tougher brother, Deckard, a former SAS soldier who is now out for revenge. He has already killed Han in Tokyo now he is after the others. One bomb puts Hobbs in hospital and a second destroys Toretto's house nearly killing him, Brian and his family. After Han's funeral Dom goes head to head with Shaw but they are interrupted by a special ops force led by 'Mr Nobody'. Shaw gets away then 'Mr Nobody' explains why he is there; a hacker known only as 'Ramsey' is in the hands of the terrorist group led by one Mose Jakande and he wants Dom and his crew to get her back before the terrorists get their hands on her 'God's Eye' programÂ a hack that gives access to all CCTV cameras which uses facial recognition to find anybody in minutes. If Dom gets her back he is promised use of God's Eye to find Shaw. Of course it will not be easy; they will have to parachute, in cars, to a remote road in a Caucasus Mountains; jump between building, in cars, in Abu Dhabi; and finally back to Los Angeles where Jakande is coming after them with a helicopter gunship and drone equipped with missilesÂ not forgetting that Dom and Shaw must face each other once again.If you are a fan of over the top action then this is the film for you; a minimum of time is spent to explain what is going on before getting into the nearly nonstop action. Expect numerous explosions, car chases, shooting, fights and some exciting (CGI assisted) stuntsÂ one couldn't expect a stuntman to jump a car between the upper storeys of three skyscrapers! It isn't just about the action; there is also a solid cast who have developed a great chemistry over the course of the seven films. This is particularly true of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker as Dom and Brian; this leads to a poignant farewell for the later character as a tribute to the actor who tragically died during filming. The rest of the regulars were on good form to and fine performances from new-comers too; most notably Jason Statham who is great a Deckard and Nathalie Emmanuel who impresses as Ramsey; I wouldn't be surprised if they return in later instalments. Overall I'd say this was probably my favourite 'Fast and Furious' film so far; the action was great and the characters are people anybody who has watched the whole series will care about."

" One Preposterous Stunt After Another
",0.0,-0.8987,2017-04-29 00:00:00,3,"With his brother in a comatose condition in the hospital, ""Deckard Shaw"" (Jason Statham) swears vengeance on ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) and his team who put him there. Now, while this should certainly be a possible cause for concern to any normal person, the fact of the matter is that Deckard is a highly trained and extremely skilled professional assassin who has a terrorist organization at his disposal to help him out. Fortunately, Dominic also has some resources of his own with ""Luke Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) and a shadowy government official who calls himself ""Mr. Nobody"" (Kurt Russell) who have separate agendas which coincide with Dominic's plans to kill Deckard before he can kill them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this picture definitely had the talent to be a very fine film. Unfortunately, the director (James Wan) resorted to one preposterous stunt after another which made this film look rather ridiculous in my opinion. Having said that, those who are fans of this particular franchise will probably love this movie for the simple fact that it has plenty of action and some of their favorite actors. Unfortunately, the complete lack of realism severely damaged its credibility in my eyes and I have rated it accordingly. Below average."

" ""Furious 7"" begs us to further embrace the insane joyride and ignore the rest
",-0.6705,0.9679,2017-04-26 00:00:00,6,"After ""Fast & Furious 6"" shifted the action of this mega-series into a gear not known to man â one resembling a superhero movie far more than an action franchise â those following the ""Fast & Furious"" had to either get on board or jump out. So the mantra for enjoying ""Furious 7"" is ""embrace the insanity."" You either get a kick out of it or you don't.For all the crazy stuff they pulled in 6, there's an equal or one-up in 7. In the last movie you had the crew trying to take down a massive cargo plane; in this movie you have cars skydiving out of a massive cargo plane. Even when you can guess something insane is coming, you still can't believe what the filmmakers decided to do. For example, a sequence in Abu Dhabi involves the crew needing to steal something locked inside of a rare and exotic car locked in a safe room at the top of one of the city's biggest buildings. Need I say more?The plot holds a little less water than 6, and to say that any ""F&F"" plot holds any more or less water than another is a big difference. The film is put in motion by the events of 6, as that film's baddie, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), is in a coma, and his special ops older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wants revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and company. Plausible, except that Deckard has an uncanny ability to track people down, show up in the right place at the right time, sneak into government facilities, perfectly time explosives and stay one step ahead of everyone â all by himself.OK, easy enough to embrace that insanity. But after Dominic decides to go after Shaw, a mysterious suit and tie named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) shows up with a small army to save the day and offer Dominic all his resources to track Shaw down if he and his crew can rescue a hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a band of mercenaries led by Mose Jakande (Djimon Honsou) and find a device she invented called the God's Eye that turns all devices into the world into a personal surveillance system that can track anyone Â All this to justify sending Dom, O'Conner (Paul Walker), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) to the Caucasus Mountains, Abu Dhabi and beyond. It's not longtime series writer Chris Morgan's finest work.With the ""we don't care about physics"" cat out of the bag, the sky is literally the limit for what these characters can do or endure. The highs of the movie come from this potential for unbelievably imaginative sequences, but so many scenes lose suspense because we know that our heroes can fall, roll over and get crushed countless times and emerge virtually unscathed. In fact, it's kind of ridiculous that Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) actually ends up in the hospital after a ""nearly fatal"" fall early in the movie. The film's most suspenseful moment involves O'Conner, but perhaps because Walker's untimely death during production had audiences in suspense over how his character would bow out.Walker's unfinished work is hard to detect. A few scenes seem out of place in an effort to use actual footage of Walker whenever possible, but if you had no idea he died during production, you'd be taken by surprise by the film's tribute ending. It really only provides us emotional catharsis for losing Paul Walker, not for the departure of Brian O'Conner from these stories. His character arc just doesn't feel complete, but undoubtedly there was only so much the filmmakers could do.Horror aficionado James Wan, taking over for four-time ""F&F"" director Justin Lin, brings a lot of Lin's style and adds a signature in various 90-degree camera rotations that usually follow characters in action sequences when they are not standing upright and usually in the air or falling. In a way, these shots acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the action scenes.""Furious 7"" probably takes itself the least seriously of all the movies thus far, and in that sense, it makes all the ridiculousness easier to stomach. Gibson's Pierce is really forced into the jokester role, and he manages a few laughs that he wasn't getting (from this critic) in previous films when he was prematurely being shoehorned into that stereotype. And Hobbs' return after being out of the middle act of the movie is perhaps the biggest signal that we're all supposed to just be having fun together.These movies haven't quite done enough to reach a higher echelon of quality given the relaxed attitude toward good storytelling, but it's clear to anyone that they are not trying to meet any needs beyond a fun time. Hence, each movie grades out pretty similarly, with a little variation here and there. If we weren't familiar with and invested in the characters and if the budget for these movies weren't so astronomical that we could have fun watching them just because they have the money to show off, the litany of flaws would be more apparent. The high entertainment value and lack of substance pretty much offset each other, resulting in movies that are immensely watchable yet only so satisfying.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" A fitting farewell for Paul walker
",0.0,0.9984,2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"James Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director's chair since the third installment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn't seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn't feel like it was anything special. I'd always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn't until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn't follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that ""cars don't fly"" when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn't necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes.By the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth installments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacris), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen's brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God's Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto's team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God's Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles.Gisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can't go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan's knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining.The greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We've grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean's Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean's where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker's untimely death. You can't help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I'm glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favourite after Fast Five."

" When did this series forget it is about cars?
",-0.2263,0.804,2017-04-13 00:00:00,4,"I want to make it clear, first and foremost, anyone dying is a tragic thing, Paul Walker was far too young and his career was only just beginning. I don't want my opinion of this film to be considered disrespectful.Furious 7 is so, so far from what the franchise used to be that I found myself ceasing to care. When did this series forget it is about cars?Set after the events of Fast and Furious 6, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his friends, excuse me ""family"", become targets for Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is out for revenge after they killed his brother. Toretto's team is recruited by a shadowy covert operation to hunt Shaw down, but to do so they need a device called The God Eye, a computer hacking tool that can simultaneously access all of the cameras in the world.This film has excessive action sequences, often running for twenty minutes or more at a time, explosions, attack helicopters, predator drones, hundreds of half naked women everywhere, flashy cars for no reason at all, bad jokes, product placement, over-long running time and most of all lazy writing. Sounds familiar right? Yet unlike many Michael Bay films this gets a free pass from critics?? This is appalling.At first I had high hopes; the opening features Dom attempting to remind his Amnesia-saddled girlfriend Letty of her past by taking her to Race Wars (a key moment in the first film) as well as his visit to Tokyo and speaking to the forgotten lead actor Lucas Black from the third film Tokyo Drift. An early bout between Statham and Dwayne Johnson's returning Agent Hobbs was also excellent.But it lost me after the sky-diving cars (yes, sky-diving cars, if you haven't seen the trailer) when our heroes, for the most redundant reason ever, must go to Abu Dhabi. After a manic mountainside battle they somehow go to Dubai in the flashiest super cars which even Toretto wouldn't drive. A Bugatti Veyron, seriously? Where did they get one of those? From the local Dubai Veyron rental service?? Going to Dubai is because a chip required for the God Eye device had been installed in a super carÂ literally no reason why. This makes the sixth movies' idea of putting a valuable microchip inside a tank inside an armoured motorcade seem believable!But why all of this nonsense? Why do we need a God Eye device? Because Jason Statham's character is so skilled that he can virtually teleport around the world completely untraceable. Or as I like to call it: lazy writing.The film is a constant, constant battlefield after the first twenty minutes. Not only do we have Statham appearing randomly throughout, but we also have Djimon Hounsou as aÂ aÂ bad man? The character development is astounding. We have his stock Asian martial artist, as well as a random burly woman in a dress for Michelle Rodriguez to fight once.This film is just immature nonsense; a weird mash of Mission Impossible, Michael Bay films and The Expendables.The action sequences when appreciated in isolation are impressive, that scene in Abu Dhabi is awesome and certainly something I've never seen beforeÂ But I need story substance and narrative cohesion to care; the Fast films used to have some semblance of structure to them, now its just a barrage of noise."
" Furious 7
",-0.5719,-0.9871,2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"Review: The Fast & the Furious 7Do you like street racing, violence, and fancy cars? Because the Fast and the Furious series had all of that and even a little more. But from the older movies like 1,2, 3, and 4 till now those movies were the a starting point for each movie like in 5, 6, and 7 the stories from the older ones were brought back to be dealt with. Actors like Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous and Sung Kang were all in most of the movies and with these characters they made these movies great to see. In Fast and the Furious 7 these characters were all in except Sung Kang because his character in the previous movie was killed in a car accident while racing. This movie gradually picks up from that point in the story and they build off of that. The Fast and the Furious 7 starts when Han is dead and a bomb that was sent to Dom house (1327) and when Deckard Shaw called to say ""you don't know me but your about too"" then the bomb blows up there whole house right after Mia (Jordana Brewster) told Dom (Vin Diesel) she was pregnant but she still never told Brian (Paul Walker). Then Dom goes to Han's funeral and sees Shaw so he takes in his car after him. They meet up and crash into each other but then while they were going to fight Mr. Nobody shows up to save Dom but allowing Deckard to escape. Eventually they work together to stop Deckard Shaw and meet a hacker by the name of Ramsey who created something known as god's eye, Which helps to find anyone in the world. Also in this movie Letty will find her memory back from all the tragedies that happened in the older movies. To me this was good but the one thing that makes this movie special is that it was the last one Paul Walker will be in because of his death. At the end they pay tribute to Paul Walker and send him to heaven in style."

",0.836,0.9633,2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,I've seen this film quite a few times now I remember first seeing it in theaters in May 2015 the tribute to Paul Walker at the end with the song See You Again really brought tears to my eyes I still can't believe that he's gone...gone but not forgotten by his Fast and Furious family I loved I could tell that what Dom was saying at the end was really from the heart Vin Diesel really thought of Paul Walker as his brother in real life as well as in the films and that really touched me. We all know what this last film is about...Deckard Shaw seeks revenge on Dom and his crew for crippling his brother in Fast and Furious 6 you see how he goes after Han first then hacks into Hobbs' computer to find out who else was involved after calling Dom and sending him a message by blowing up his house so this is pretty much an action/revenge film in the end Deckard and Dom have a street fight which is pretty epic the soundtrack in this is also amazing to me this is probably Vin Diesel's best performance in the Fast and Furious series I also loved Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw and I'm glad he's coming back in The Fate of The Furious which is coming out this April but for me I don't think it will top this one it looks awesome but not as good as this. Paul Walker you are missed R.I.P. I give this a 10/10 and if you're a fan of the films and have not yet seen this I strongly advise that you do.
" Fake and unrealistic, very lame

Movie is so unrealistic and boring, actors are so boring throughout the series and people think they are good actors only because of their looks. Like really? Driving one building to another? So unrealistic nobody wouldn't do that on real life unless they can land on the ground safely. I feel like I'm the only person in the universe who's smart enough to know how fake this movie is, people acts like they did all this in real life when they didn't. Also it's lame how their character won't die as if they are immortal which isn't possible in real life. It so easy to not die in movies it's like Call Of Duty where you can't die in campaign or else you're stuck in one mission and can't proceed."
" A Furiously Heart-fueled Eulogy
",-0.4404,0.7623,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Family and friends raced into local theaters hours in advance to grab seats for their latest action-packed and absurdly ridiculous, ""Furious 7."" Since its first installment ""The Fast and the Furious"" in 2001, the franchise has lovingly become a tacky, silver-screen staple for youth all over the world. Haters don't hate. If you've seen one, two or seven of the films by now, you knew exactly what you were in for, and you still showed up.""Furious 7"" once again took things to the next level with more impossible high-flying stunts and an entire script of quotably profound one-liners about the meaning of family â or how serious a beating one is about to receive. The film expanded on its already large cast by introducing several new actors including Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou and to my enjoyment, Tony Jaa from the martial arts cult-favorite ""Ong-bak"" films. However, this highly farcical sequel was full of bittersweet anticipation as an entire nation gathered, paying tribute to the tragic, early death of actor Paul Walker, by seeing a journey that's lasted for more than a decade now, through to the end.Walker, who has been around since the beginning, playing one of ""The Fast and the Furious"" original characters, Brian O'Conner, a young undercover cop who infiltrated an East Los Angeles gang of behind-the-scenes outlaws, tragically died in a high-speed car crash on Nov. 30, 2013. After taking time to grieve, shocked ""Furious 7"" crew members delicately moved on with production.""Furious 7"" ended up destroying box office records during its debut weekend, picking up a massive $143.6 million in North America and $240.4 million overseas; totaling an impressive $384 million overall. Not only did ""Furious 7"" become the largest opener among its predecessors. After its release, it set a milestone by ranking number four in the top 10 highest opening films of all time â proving to be one of Hollywood's most iconic and profitable franchises.Where do we go from here though? Is this the end of the ""Furious"" franchise? Not for directors and producers. It seems their grieving period ran little-more than a quarter of a mile. The eighth installment by Universal Pictures is currently set to be released April 14, 2017. Surely, many fans will be torn over another sequel, especially one excluding Walker for obvious reasons. My suggestion would be to revisit the idea of branching off on side character stories like they did in the 2006 semi-sequel ""Tokyo Drift."" But, with such a huge fan base and record-breaking turnout for the presumed final installment, Universal can't this cash cow go to pasture in good taste.It's worth mentioning that producers and directors were more heartfelt in the manner which they handled Walker's passing. Usually in these situations, productions will omit a deceased actor from future scenes or films by letting their character perish as well. In the case of ""Furious 7,"" however, director James Wan decided to see Walker's character through to the end, finishing the film with the help of Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody as stand-ins, and some subtle, well-placed computer effects; giving everyone a final, emotional montage of ""Fast and Furious"" Walker moments â reminding us of the gravity he had on our lives throughout the past 14 years.Thanks for the lavishly unbelievable, yet genuinely profound journey Paul, giving us all a reason to do hoop-dee burn-outs in theater parking lots across the nation, to live a little faster and burn a little brighter.""If one day the speed kills me, don't cry, because I was smiling."" â Paul Walker"
" Movie for a select (but growing) group of people
",0.0,0.8311,2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"I never understood why this franchise always made so much money and why so many people like it. Unless you like to see half naked women sponging on wet cars, cars with modified engines used in street races (and of course it's all done in a team of outlaw guys, the so-called ""family"", against other teams with people with similar desires) and to escape the police (police haters, they should inflate the scores here in IMDb), and to illicit traffic drugs and money, this type of film is not for you.I have a theory of mine because this series remains strong in the box office and each film gets better box office than the previous film of this franchise. The secret lies in the breakdown of our society. When this franchise began in 2001, our society was morally not decadent as it is today, nor so violent. In the last 16 years our society has grown worse and the values ââof the old days began to disappear and our society and the moviegoers in general began to identify more and more ,each time, with the ""characters"" of this type of film. This is the only explanation, which I see, because every movie this franchise has billed every time the previous movie.Not anything, in this movie at the level of content or structure that is worth as a film, whether purely as fun / entertaining or for possible logical/ make you think. Not a single quality exists in this film (or in this franchise, but actually beyond the seventh film, I only saw the second film in this series (which I consider absolute crap).Anything. Plot is not interesting, shallow characters like a plate, unless you like what they do. Characters with generic lines and say cool one liner to impress the younger ones. Bureaucratic action scenes - two guys jump with a sport car at high speed between two skyscrapers. The damage is minimal, almost non-existent. Ridiculous ending. ChichÃ© story and action scenes without suspense, tension or in a interesting way visually. At least.A waste of time, at least for me."
