To the point movie, No faltu drama and one more, no item song.. Brilliant performance by R Madhavan and Ritika singh. Especially Ritika singh just nailed her character.. Yup story is a bit predictible but overall a must watch for them who likes content based movies.."
" My Review!
",0.0,0.9712,2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,"The only reason I went for this movie is for our very R Madhavan. This guy, I don't know how he does it, but he acted FANTASTIC as all the movies I've seen of him. The character was crystal clear. The lead actress did a equally good job. Overall, it's a kind of movie that just makes you like a few scenes but not the whole movie.Peace Out! :)"
" A Fantastic Film
",0.5574,0.9877,2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,"I am starting to fall in love with the film industries down South. They are consistently coming up with these fantastic stories that deserve a watch by all of India. This one was a pleasant surprise for me especially because I didn't go into it with any expectations. Led by one of the best South-to-Bollywood transition actors- R. Madhavan- this movie started great and only reached greater heights after that. The female lead was also fantastic- both in the acting and stunt departments. The story itself was something else. I was frustrated by the politics involved in sports. Even the supporting cast, including the main antagonist, enriched the film further. Honestly, I was bowled over with this film. The climax especially was amazing. India needs more films like this one."
" Good direction and solid performances from the leads.
",0.5423,0.9985,2018-12-15 00:00:00,6,"Yes, it does look like a combination of ""Chak De India"" and ""Mary Kom"". There is the disgraced former boxer, looking for redemption in a talented protégé. There is the young, poor talented girl who seeks to punch through glass barriers in her sport and life. There are political machinations that plague all of our sports associations. This film does not steer clear of the underdog-against-all obstacles formula, and in hindsight might feel like it had a lot more potential than the end product. Yet, ""Irudhi Suttru"" feels fresh, and that freshness is due to the combined efforts of a director who knows how to treat her material, and her perfectly cast characters. For a second movie, this is good work, and hopefully she learns from her mistakes and strengthens her plus points, to paraphrase coach Prabhu (Madhavan).Yes, there are plenty of flaws in the film, but for every stilted character scene, there are many inspired moments. The clichéd scenes are performed at such a high level that they don't feel forced. The film does a wonderful job telling a predictable story that I found myself not minding the awkwardness that usually fills me during a sports movie.Madhavan makes an inspired turn as Prabhu, a character that is not only different from Shah Rukh Khan's Kabir, he infuses it with a personality that sets it apart with enough distinction from other disgruntled, flawed, mentor characters we have seen (and will continue to see) in movies. He has devoted three years to this movie, which is evident not just in the amount of muscle he has packed, but a wonderful performance in a role that is far apart from his comfort zone. Ritika Singh as Madhi and Mumtaz Sorcar as Lux does wonderful jobs with their characters that I set aside my issues with the formulaic character arcs. Ritika, as the spontaneous, free-spirited, tempestuous Madhi, carries the demands of the lead well. She can certainly improve from here, with a few more movies in a few more years. Nasser, such a pleasing actor to watch that he is, shines best among the secondary characters.Music is wonderful. Especially the song 'Sandakara', beautifully picturised on Ritika, the location I'm assuming is somewhere in Punjab, is an absolute joy to watch. The mandatory dappan kuthu song is captured in a fresh way in the gullies of Chennai and it carries forward the flow of the movie.Later, I might change my mind about this movie. But right now, I feel good. That, ultimately, is what is important.Verdict: Certainly enjoyable, worth your time. 6.5/10"
