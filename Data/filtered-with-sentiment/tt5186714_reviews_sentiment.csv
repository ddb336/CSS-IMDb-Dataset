" underwhelming... sort of
",0.0,-0.5933,2021-04-05 00:00:00,7,"After watching A Separation, The Past and About Elly, i had a high expectation of The Salesman. It still has a Asghar trademark, visually simplistic, no music and great acting. But unfortunately, the story felt a little flat and dragged. The 'twist' is underwhelming, with no actual resolution of the story."

I know the movies. Hell shows the audience. Where it is said in the conversation that the reconstruction of Tehran is not right! This movie is not good at all. 1/10"
" FAMILIAR EMOTIONS.

If it wasn't 2 hrs long. It's fairly heavy and emotionally-moving in *some* places, but for me, not enough to justify a 2hr screentime. I would argue the story could have been as effective with 30+ minutes less footage.And it wasn't mindblowingly emotional for me, it was more interesting as a look into understanding a different culture, rather than each individual character.The performances were natural and on point."
" Very well put together
",0.3384,-0.9094,2021-01-26 00:00:00,8,"This Iranian film pulls together a reflection on both the iranian culture and art, censorship, restraint and a sense of decency and then flips this on its side when the wife of the main character is attacked in their own home. Through
a combination of revenge and grief the main character begins to lose himself and the film then builds together an ending that really builds the tension. Overall, a really well put together movie which although it takes a while to get to its point, once it gets there, it really delivers."

It gradually favours a perspective more critical than empathetic, straining the link sought between art, empathy and retribution. Still, a stately film that's wonderful in its smaller moments."
" Fractures in the house and the family unit, but the drama is solid here

When one couple move to a new flat, the wife (Taraneh Alidoosti), an actress, alleges she has been sexually assaulted by a stranger who has entered the home causing a strain in the marriage to her husband (Shahab Hosseini).Once again director Asghar Farhadi strikes drama gold with a drama about how an upsetting event can rupture a loving family unit and the domestic setting. He did it previously with such films as A SEPARATION (2011) and THE PAST (2013). This time he has expanded out somewhat in making the couple actors who are attempting to stage a production of Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman' with a plot that invites comparison. The drama builds well and is engaging throughout."
" A Lesson of Life
",0.0,-0.8462,2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"The Salesman is a 2016 drama film written and directed by Asghar Farhadi.
The story of The Salesman concerns a young Iranian couple, Emad and Rana who work as lead
performers at a local theatre and are preparing for their next gig i.e. Arthur Miller's Death of a
Salesman. Forced to leave their collapsing apartment due to dangerous works on an adjacent building,
the two rent a new flat. Things are set in motion when an unexpected incident linked to the previous
tenant occurs in their new home and turns their peaceful life upside down.
The wife is assaulted. Her husband attempts to determine the identity of the attacker, while she
struggles to cope with post-trauma stress. Emad finds the culprit left his car keys, which he matches to a
pickup truck parked outside their new apartment. As the movie progresses, we see that Emad is able to
track down the owner of the pickup truck with the help of one of his student's father. He pretends to
need a mover to lure Majid to their now empty old apartment, but Majid's prospective father-in-law
arrives instead. Gradually, it becomes apparent the older man was himself the intruder. Emad, now
fixated on getting revenge, invites the old man's family to the apartment in order to expose him.
Crafted with immaculate vision & precision control, Farhadi narrates the entire tale
immaculately and intertwines the film's multi-layered structure into a single strand, which then
allows him to establish & gradually escalate the tension.
The script is just as carefully refined as his direction, packing a believable set of characters who
are enacted by a talented crew delivering powerful performances. Farhadi's innate ability to bring
his written characters to life with remarkable genuineness plus the close proximity between their
situation and its very possibility of happening in real life resonates on such a personal level with
the viewers that it allows them to invest in these scripted people's lives.
The Salesman is a captivating movie with a stellar ending, ingeniously directed by Asghar
Farhadi, who can make his viewers weep for the protagonist and antagonist of the film in the
same frame."

I don't know if this is deliberate and the director is trying to tell us something about Iranian society but it reminds me cheesy Turkish soap operas where the enigma will be resolved instantly if people talked to each other patiently rather than raging or looking away. As a Turkish person who's never been to Iran yet, I find Iranian films fascinating even for the similar looks, customs, objects and life style we seem to share. But unfortunately I don't find it realistic that people don't talk or have a proper fight with each other although living/working together. Maybe I'm too naive though, I don't know..."
" Overrated but watchable
",0.0,0.8205,2020-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Having read some over the top praises of this film I think some balance might help. The themes about a shaky society, male/female roles etc are pretty laboured, and never are articulated, too many silenced without much content. There are a number of continuity problems; why is Bajar the landlord so secretive about the tenant? Why does the assailant leave his phone, keys, and money and vehicle behind? Is the small child the assailants? What actually happened?"

The incident leaves her traumatised and puts stresses on her marriage; her husband seeks revenge, motivated not entirely from concern for her but also from a measure of wounded male pride. I didn't really understand the choice of title for the movie (is the play-within-the-film really so important to the film as a whole?) and its opening half is slow, painful but not particularly enjoyable to watch. The second half is much stronger: instead of a typical stupid Hollywood ""revenge"" plot, we actually have a delicate (though suspenseful) drama that centres of the importance to us of how we are perceived by others. Farhadi, as he has shown in his other films, is skilled at depicting the interactions between ordinary people in a compelling way. It's ultimately worthwhile sitting through the somewhat dreary start."

This movie however really misses the mark with a silly script that has too many irrelevancies, and non-contributory scenes. The story just drags on forever and has a very unsatisfactory ending. There just seemed no point to such an overly long movie."
" There was the emotional wound in another dimension.
",0.1531,-0.9877,2019-08-29 00:00:00,5,"I was annoyed for the insensitive conduct by Emad. I felt that it was lack of thoughtfulness because I'm female perhaps.
Why did he search the criminal who raped his wife, Rana? For hurted her or by the hate against the criminal who gave them in a trouble? Even if he could catch it and solve the practical crime, there was the emotional wound in another dimension.
His revenge idea was critical absolutely unless the criminal wasn't crazy and alone. It was based on 'Code of Hammurabi.' He tried to destroy the criminal's life as his was done.
Emad and Rana had their private lives in a bland way. In the other side, the insides were reflected throughout each roles on the stages they acted together. I realized that by her emotional acting in credit role.I was tired since I didn't think this movis is such serious tone. Additionaly, it was a bit difficult.

Farhadi is a filmmaker who always seems to know exactly how much to reveal to an audience without being either too opaque or too obnoxious. The live performance motifs throughout really elevate the actuality in the characters' lives."
" A modern man turning into a conservative
",0.0,0.5845,2019-06-10 00:00:00,9,"Because their own home has become uninhabitable, a young couple (Emad and Rana) temporarily moves into an apartment that has been recommended by a colleague. The previous occupant turns out to be a prositute, and a client of this prostitute harrases the woman by accident (not knowing that the prostitute has moved away). Emad tries to track down this client. During the movie this becomes an obsession for him.The film begins rather confusing with images of a bed on a theater stage (Emad and Rana are members of a theater-company that is performing ""Death of a salesman"" by Arthur Miller) and the evacuation of a flat that threatens to collapse. Both have only an indirect link to the main story. In Iranian cinema the ""play in the play"" concept is not unknown. Look for example to ""Through the olives trees"" (1994, Abbas Kiarostami). But Asghar Farhadi does not belong to the generation of filmmakers who was responsible for the Iranian new wave in the beginning of the '90. I do not see a direct link between the ""Death of a salesman"" play and the main story of the movie. Links suggested in other reviews seem far fetched to me.The movies of Farhadi are most of the time relational movies in which he pays tribute to a writer as Tennessee Williams and a directer as Elia Kazan. The collapse of the building in the beginning of the movie is not only the introduction to the main story (the couple needs a new home) but has also symbolic significance. The cracks in the wall symbolise the cracks in the marriage that will arise later in the movie. The strongest point in the movie is how it evolves from a thriller (who donnit) to a relation drama. In this drama questions arise such as:
Is Emad protecting his wife or his own ego?
Is Emad protecting or destroying his marriage?
How is it possible that in a modern man like Emad the old fashioned value patterns take the upper hand so quickly?
As befits a good movie, it only pioses the questions and does not answer them.After the Iranian movie ""A seperation"" (2011) Farhadi made the more international movie ""The past"" (2013). ""The salesmen"" (2016) is again typical Iranian. In movies in which previous occupants have an influence, the previous occupants most of the time have a psychological defect (compare ""Le locataire"" (1976, Roman Polanski)). In this case the previous occupant is a prostitude and the neigbours refer to her in the vaguest of terms (the woman who often had male visitors)."

" The Salesman - Sells Little Of True Value
",0.5658,0.974,2018-11-19 00:00:00,4,"So, after watching, I read that I've just looked at an Award winning drama - this came as somwhat of a surprise - as there seemed little solid 'Award' material evident. It almost apears Awards might now be given out to sell a trendy moviemaker or a 'product'. 'Salesman' is a vague, dreary movie in almost every sense - now this can be a good component if used to its full value but, this work is centred around an incident that happens in a very scant time - so scant, that all the elements that make up the largest percentage of the story are left wanting, as in, hardly believable or full of obviously undeveloped character motivation and situations (we also never truly find out 'precisely' what happened) Seems this could be all award-winning works now need...a grim situation, overblown to look stronger than the writing actually sets up - this appears especially so if there's also a 'politicised' slant.Add to this a plot background reference to a literary classic (""Death of a Salesman"") to suggest this work must also be intelligent by association but, that 'association' can equally be seen as a highly questionable metaphor. The situations that make up the sum of this movies scenario are somewhat pretentious and far from worthy of such high praise (as many other worldwide viewers have clearly noted) Performances are routinely good but the material is just too thin to last the dismal 2 Hr distance. If you're inclined to think Awards must automatically represent high quality you may be satisfied - conversely, if you see the awards as 30% quality, 35% promotion and 35% 'political' - you just might find yourself joining others among the disappointed."
" The Salesman Doesn't Oversell - yet, evokes reassurance in fighting a losing war
",-0.7035,0.8968,2018-10-26 00:00:00,8,"""...how beautifully fragile are we that so many things can take but a moment to alter who we are for forever?""
Samuel Decker ThomsonAs we open to the stage being set through the moving facades and focused dim-lights of a half-furnished empty theatre (the dress-rehearsal of Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"" by the protagonists and friends), we soon cut towards the cacophony of evacuating a building - with its façade collapsing. Through such irony and chaos, we are introduced to Emad (Shahab Hosseini, ""A Separation"") and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti, ""About Elly"") - a married couple in their 30s harbouring those collective dreams, who were picking up their household and securing a new apartment.Little did they know that moving houses shall cost them a home. The new apartment had a shady history - the last dweller being an escort woman, who hurriedly left without her belongings citing issues with her clients. Then one ominous day, Rana alone in the new apartment is mistaken for her previous tenant and assaulted by an intruder. Though only physically hurt, she struggles terribly with her mental trauma which also got the better of Emad.
Again, as they try picking up their lives while goofing up their parts in the play, they both knew that it would take time - but, only if time healed all wounds, esp. the ones given by the 'times' itself.So, as Rana sets her foot down to avoid a revenge (and subsequent guilt) with the intruder (an old, rattled carpet-seller) Emad painfully complies by letting the man go with just a slap. Soon enough, they find him passing-out with a heart-attack surrounded by the unaware family of his own.
Much like the Salesman who courted failures of his profession and personal life, Emad and Rana tried their hardest to reinstate the tranquillity of their marriage. In the aftermath, as the drained out couple sits for another pre-run make-up session, their eyes draw a blank semblance of ghosts of their shared grief.The film carries ""story-within-a-story"" format (Miller's ""...Salesman"" and Farhadi's Emad and Rana) sharing the theme of the ""abomination of living"". Asghar Farhadi's treatment towards his pivotal middle-class Iranian life (familiarized in his first Academy Award-winning - ""A Separation"") retrospect through one's own misgivings and vulnerabilities is surprisingly inspiring.Nevertheless, writer-director Asghar Farhadi builds up an innocent-seeming ambience and then, almost mercilessly, smashing it to smithereens. Still, this film isn't a usual tragedy; neither a completely unusual one. It does portray genuine apathy but doesn't drop to any deliberate pathos. Without overselling anything, ""the Salesman"", evokes some reassurance even while fighting a losing war.This well-shot (Cinematography by Hossein Jafarian ""About Elly"") work is masterfully merged with one of the best screenplays of previous years, winning dual Cannes Awards (""Best Screenwriting"" for Farhadi and ""Best Actor"" for Hosseini) and further acclaim by a second Oscar for ""Best Foreign Language Film"".
In a sensitive global-political environment, it is a slight nod to the times that we live in where we may have to not just protect but nurture our families with utmost care for crafting a better future.Heartbreaking and Remarkable! An 8.5/10."

" Technically sound but lacking a point
",0.0,-0.9938,2018-06-03 00:00:00,2,"I enjoyed this movie as I was watching it, with my admiration growing and reaching a crescendo up until about 10 minutes from the end, at which point things headed seriously south. But as the credits rolled and the distractions of the brilliance of the acting and execution disappeared a whole wave of questions came crashing down which pretty much destroyed the underpinning logic of the whole story and undoing any redeeming features it may have hadIf you look at the ""story"" scene by scene there is very little that stacks up as being logical or natural and the whole thing is exposed as a rickety structure stuck together by bits of string and sealing wax by the director/writer to make some point. While this lack of logic might be forgivable if the point was worth the deception, personally I fail to see what exactly that point is, let alone what it might be worth. Speaking of rickety structures, let's talk about the collapsing building first. Surely this must be the most ridiculously outrageous and unlikely scenario ever concocted to provide the relatively simple premise of someone having to find a new flat. Is the art of building in Tehran so basic that this sort of thing happens on a regular basis? Was that quick cut to a piece of digging equipment supposed to imply that this was the cause of this disaster? Really? And what on earth is the whole point of ""The death of a salesman"" side issue? If this is supposed to be the classic ""play within a play"" conceit, a la Saura's Carmen, then I must have missed something, for while indeed in the film's coda a (shirt) ""salesman"" may indeed have died, if there is any similarity beyond that it went right over my head. And the whole crucial set up of why Rana left the door open is totally tenuous to say the least. As for the culprit rushing off leaving his keys, his phone and his pick-up truck? Ridiculous. And just how did that glass get on the stairs and why did the culprit not have his shoes off? And while his socks were found, where were his shoes? And how come the pick-up truck, apparently a crucial part of at least 2 businesses, was allowed to remain at the flat for a number of days without any of said businesses missing it? And what is all the nonsense with the previous tenant leaving all her belongings at the flat, something that is entirely irrelevant to the story. And how did Ehmad suddenly end up at the Hospital and why is he so unmoved by his wife's plight? What exactly did happen to Rana we never find out - it is ridiculous to think the old man hurt her so we can only presume she slipped and hurt her head. Why was it not possible to find out more information on the man's phone, even if it was ""cancelled""? Why was the pick-up truck not examined in detail? What was the point of that episode with Ehmad in the car and a lady wanting to change seats? Why would Ehmad think that the driver of the pick-up truck was the culprit when clearly it is a commual vehicle? Why did he not confront the suspect on the spot instead of making up some hare brain story about wanting to move some things? Why would the suspect actually agree to this, and why when he couldn't come in person would he send his future father in law who is half dead and lucky to make it up the stairs? Who is stupid enough to lock a half dead man in a closet for hours?This, then, is the house of cards that forms the backdrop to the ""story"". So what is the actual ""story""? Basically it can be summarised in a very few simple sentences. A woman is ""assaulted"", although we never find out if this is because she was startled by a peeping tom and slipped, or whether she was bashed over the head. Said woman has PTSD, well fair enough. Woman's husband is not angry but resentful of woman's subsequent behaviour. Husband identifies the ""culprit"" and threatens to expose him to his family. His wife gives an ultimatum that if he does so she will leave him. For a moment all seems well and the culprit's family start to take him away. Then, for reasons only known to the husband he reneges at the last minute and exposes the culprit to his family. An ambulance arrives the culprit may or may not be dead and the wife walks out the door.If anyone can tell me the meaning of all this they are a better man/woman than I am. If the movie had stopped before Ehmad exposed the culprit it could at least have ended on a poignant note of redemption and forgiveness, a cliche perhaps, but at least a good one and one that would have redeemed the movie despite its many flaws. By allowing Ahmed to expose him the director destroyed any possible payout for the audience and all we are left with is a bunch of question marks set against an artificial world and involving people we really don't care too much about.In conclusion all I can do is echo what I have already said in my review of another movie by this director (""About Elly""), which is that this movie seems largely an academic exercise pretending to be something deeper than what it actually is."

The movie itself wasn't bad but not great either. It's one of those movies I don't regret watching but I'm pretty sure I won't watch it a second time and that I will forget about it in a couple weeks. The story was okay, but just a bit too slow for me. And it also could have been a bit more feisty, with a bit more revenge at the end. But that's my personal choice.

" Another superb film by Asghar Farhadi
",0.6249,0.9816,2018-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) are a couple living in Tehran who work in theatre (currently performing in ""Death of a Salesman""). In their newly acquired apartment, Rana is assaulted by a stranger and suffers post-traumatic stress. Emad vows revenge.A major event in the movie's first half takes place off-screen. This leaves the viewer in the position of judge rather than witness as we can only surmise events from what others have told. The movie's first half is good though relatively plain. But, as the viewer learns later, it is a build-up to an unforgettable second half. This is a wonderful contrast to the many films where the opposite is true. When a movie's second half is the better one, the viewer is given an unofficial extension of the movie as its impact continues well after the ending.Director/writer Asghar Farhadi brings to ""The Salesman"" similar themes (and greatness) as he did with ""A Separation"" (2011) and ""The Past"" (2013). Among the various characters, we in the audience can understand why some would hate others but, by the end, we have compassion for every single one of them especially after we learn more information about the ""villain"". In this way, Farhadi is not just a great storyteller but a fine humanitarian as well. By giving all viewpoints sincerely, he challenges viewers to not only do reconsider anger in our personal lives but possibly in how we look at the world as well. This is noble considering the current state of our world.Hosseini and Alidoosti are quite good in their performances but the standout performance comes from Farid Sajjadi Hosseini as a character who enters the picture only in the second half and leaves the most impact in the movie.Like ""A Separation"" and ""The Past"", ""The Salesman"" is food for the soul and it confirms Farhadi as one of the best movie-makers in the 2010s.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Screenplay by Asghar Farhadi"

Film is stupid, annoying:
The movie is so anti-sex that the characters kept accusing a prior neighbor of promiscuity, to blame her and explain the ensuing evil (the rape, primarily).
The supposedly intelligent husband stupidly assumes, without talking to her about it, that his wife is ready to jump right back on stage after being violently raped and hospitalized."

It's the story of a couple are forced to leave their collapsing apartment building, when a friend offers them a flat to live in but he doesn't tell them this it was formerly inhabited by a prostitute. While home alone at night and taking a shower, the wife is attacked, and has difficulty coping with the aftermath. 
This is a film set in Iran but it could be set anywhere. The people in this film are just like you and me and although there are cultural difference you wouldn't really know it in this film.
Writer and director Asghar Farhadi has made thought provoking film about disgrace , revenge , and pride and the cast do him proud.

" A fascinating dramatic effort
",0.5423,0.9759,2017-11-14 00:00:00,8,"Winner of this year's Best Foreign Language Oscar at the Academy Awards, The Salesman continues on Iranian director Asghar Farhadi's stunning recent collection of dramatic works that includes fellow Oscar winner A Separation and Golden Globe nominee The Past.An intense and intimate drama that veers into a character driven and decision making thriller in its later stages, Farhadi's film focuses on the fractured relationship that begins to build between married couple Emad and Rana Etesami after Rana is violently assaulted in the couples new rental property.Brilliantly played by Shahab Hosseini and Taraneh Alidoosti respectively, Emad and Rana are both believable characters and well-drawn ones, staples of Farhadi's ever increasing strong body of works, and their separate journey's in learning to deal with and overcome this violation of their lives is one you as an audience member will be drawn into like a moth to a flame.Emad who's initially a strong and respectable figure, a beloved teacher and theatre actor (the title of this film relates to Emad and Rana's role in a stage production of The Death of a Salesman) finds himself increasingly captivated by the quest to find the perpetrator of the assault on Rana, that slowly but surely unravels his usual in-command lifestyle, while Rana's mental mindset and ability to cope with the trauma of this event sees her become a shell of her former self, unable even to do mundane run of the mill tasks.Farhadi expertly deals with this situation that arises in the Etesami's life, the film feels almost like a documentary, so real are scenes played out and as Emad's quest takes a potentially dangerous turn as the film enters into its final stretches, The Salesman's tension riddled and fiercely real situation's become some of the year's most wholly captivating, as we're trust headfirst into decisions that will affect these characters lives till the end of their days.Final Say – The Salesman isn't flashy cinema but Farhadi's carefully considered drama has a raw and poignant power that will lay its grip on viewers and won't let go until the credits roll, making The Salesman another fine feature film from one of the world's most consistent and original filmmakers.4 sleeping teachers out of 5"
" Director Need Lessons
",0.0,-0.5334,2017-10-17 00:00:00,3,"""The Salesman"" is a pre-bad (worse than bad) movie; a nugatory one. It neither sells anything nor buy. It is unable to sell and buy and incapable of dealing or discussing at all.It's a not-yet-made, confused and passive movie to which the action happens- from the outside-. It doesn't have any sort of action of its own, let alone character. It's a movie with no story, script, directing, camera-work, or editing.The movie doesn't even have an acceptable ""what"" due to a hollow script to which anything enters and from which anything exits. The script lacks many necessary things but contains lots of useless ones, instead. Of course, nothing has been aesthetically removed from the script, for nothing is there in the first place. Thus the writer doesn't have anything at all to remove.The movie is incomplete, unfinished and ""open"". The director doesn't know that an ""open"" phenomenon is not a phenomenon yet. It can be open only after it is able to be closed and after it is completely finished.Our director, as if he knows that his ""The Salesman"" needs a lot of effort yet to be a movie, attends lots of interviews and attaches himself to his dumb movie. He pretends to be oppressed, spark controversy about himself, and soothe himself by making a ""modern"" pretension to be intellectual and relativist. Thus, he pleases himself for ""causing the audience to have a mental challenge"" and ""that the audience is full of questions while coming out of the theatre is of worth"" for him.One should remind him that it is not worthy at all if the audience come out of the theatre being confused by lots of unanswered questions. It is not worthy at all if all of those questions are about the ""what"" of the story but not ""how"" it is told. it is not worthy at all if the origin of the questions is the audience not facing a specific and finished story by which he can reach the ""how"" and experience.He (the director) has left us no other choice but to remind him that cinema is neither a horn nor a riddle. A work of art is a live experience, not a proposition or the answer to several questions. Art is not a statement, but the way of stating. The audience's challenge with a good work of art is intuitive and emotional, then intellectual. The intellectual who doesn't have the slightest idea of feelings, is one of the concept-oriented people who can never understand art.The audience's main question about this vague and passive movie is the following: ""Is someone raped or just attacked?"" In order to pretend that the movie is important, the director decisively says, in one of the interviews, that ""no one is raped."" Nevertheless, the movie implies the opposite. Not in its mise en scene- which isn't actually there-, but by two dialogues; one is of the wretched violator's (""I was tempted."") and the other one is of the doleful victim's (""I wish I were dead.""). In another interview, with a Hitchcock sense of humor- which doesn't fit him at all- the director mentions that he hasn't been in the bathroom, so he doesn't know what has happened."

" Farhadi's dramaturgy still rocks, but a fly in the ointment is that his hand-picked moral tale needs some tweaking
",0.0,0.9134,2017-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Iranian moral dramatist Asghar Farhadi's seventh feature THE SALESMAN wins him a second Oscar in the BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE bloodbath amid a political fracas, which in my humble opinion irrevocably influences the end result. The titular salesman refers to our protagonist Emad (Cannes' BEST ACTOR recipient Hosseini), however he is not a salesman by vocation, but a high school teacher presently headlining a play of Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN, in which his wife Rana (Alidoosti) also stars. In the movie's opening, they are evacuating from a collapse-prone building where they live, and among all the ruckus, Farhadi smartly bookends it with two cracks on a windowpane before showing us an excavator working on the ground outside, a brilliant visual pointer to adumbrate what comes next: Emad and Rana's bonhomous relationship is going to crumble after an incident, and the rest of the film will sure-footedly take us to comb through their ordeal and elicit what is the crux. The incident occurs in the new apartment where the pair just moves in, although Farhadi opts to keep the happening off the screen, when someone buzzes their door, Rana takes its as given that it is Emad and leaves the door open without asking who it is (a plot devise looks implausible falling upon a Muslim woman who is alone at home, in the buff, though Farhadi furnishes the couple with a more Westernized predisposition), and later is assaulted by a man when she is in the bath, blood is spattered but she survives. Few details are revealed by a traumatized Rana, to an extend it, purposefully, hinders viewers' final verdict on this atrocity, it seems like the old chestnut of leaving audience to formulate their own judgement, but in this case, it recoils on our perception of the story after its lachrymose climax, during which Farhadi makes great play of his compassion manipulation excesses. But which side should we take is precisely predicated upon the missing pieces, otherwise, the entire drama degrades into a moot point. We can side with a perturbed Emad, who takes it on himself to track down the assaulter and implement his eye-for-an-eye revenge even impelled by Rana to keep the truth under wraps from the assaulter's family, or conversely, we should feel disposed towards Rana's magnanimous gesture, even a sordid soul deserves some sympathy, or, more deleteriously, is there a sideswipe on her too, because she should be partially responsible for what happened to her and should her relenting smack of an atonement for her own slip-up? Farhadi takes chances of complicating the central mind game out of artistic license, but the catch is that, regarding the situation's nature, this is not a case of splitting the difference, there are ambiguity residing in this imperfect patriarchal society where shame/humiliation often linked with a putrid waft of machismo, but if we look it through a more matter-of-fact angle, Rana is the victim here, both physically and mentally, why on earth she cannot have the final say on the subject matter? Maybe this is what Farhadi contends, but it doesn't pack an epiphanic punch as his previous works have done. Be that as it may, THE SALESMAN has its incontrovertible mastery in the vein, the paralleled three- act play-in-a-movie aptly mirrors Emad and Rana's fix in the real world (disillusion is the commonality) and the film's tension building-and-retaining process is par excellence in today's cinema-scape. The leading roles are entrusted to two Farhadi's frequent collaborators with arresting outcome, in particular, Shahab Hosseini amazingly holds sway as a reluctant terrorizer in the play off with a humbled Farid Sajjadi Hosseini, not the usual suspect of a sex offender, and not to mince words, Farhadi's dramaturgy still rocks, but a fly in the ointment is that his hand-picked moral tale needs some tweaking."
" An argentine melodrama in Farsi
",0.0,0.7874,2017-09-03 00:00:00,7,"I applaud director Farhadi for making Iran more accessible to outsiders, focusing on modern urban issues, and making Tehran more internationally relatable. But I'm not a fan of his pacing or how he plays out the drama. I had low expectations as ""A Separation"" lost me due to the unrelenting yelling between its characters. ""The Salesman"" was more lively and allowed its characters to have more emotions. But two things ultimately distracted me: the first was the uneven pacing. The movie would pick up but then drag, and the worst part being the final act; just as the dialogue, drama, and suspense were at its best, and Farhadi has you feeling empathy for everyone, he does not know when to quit, and gives us almost 20 minutes of people crying.The second one was: I realized that he was just making an Argentine film. If you've seen Argentine cinema, that you'll notice that, aside from the occasional dark comedy, they're mostly slow-paced melodrama about relationships between family members and the communities, where people go from being numb to an ultimate eruption of emotions. Even their thrillers play out this way. Shahab Hosseini looked and acted like Ricardo Darin, down to the body language and linguistic pacing. Thus, I felt like I had seen this movie a dozen times before.It is no surprise to me that Farhadi's next film is set in Argentina and involves Darin."
" The Salesman (2016)
",0.0,-0.8502,2017-08-09 00:00:00,8,"This film made waves at the Academy Awards (not just for the Academy boycott). I've been meaning to check it out at some point, and finally had the opportunity to watch it on an airplane during a flight. I've heard of A Separation but never watched it. Going in pretty blind into this film, I was very pleased with the end product. I read Death of a Salesman in high school and was able to spot some parallels.The film is about a husband and wife who work in theatre (on a production of Death of a Salesman). One night their apartment starts collapsing so they move into a new apartment. Soon the wife gets attacked in the shower while waiting for her husband. The husband becomes consumed with finding out who attacked his wife and attempts to pursue the culprit even as relationships around him start falling apart.A lot of people didn't find this to be as good as A Separation, or so I've heard. I thought the script for the film was quite sharp. Like Billy Loman in Death of a Salesman , Emad's relationship is on the rocks. He must also try to avoid the humiliation of what occurred within his family and must wrong the right. While the film is a bit of a slow burn on finding out who committed the act, the clues leading up to the reveal and the ride is very fun to be a part of.I found the last 30 minutes or so of the film to be powerful and it also helps to ascend the film to a higher rating. Its gripping and hard to keep your eyes off of what happens next. Its suspenseful but yet innocuous You know there's no immediate danger to the lead but wow its a joy to watch what transpires. I will have to eventually check out A Separation, especially if its more acclaimed than this.8/10"
" Another Slow Burn
",0.0,-0.9856,2017-07-31 00:00:00,8,"Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi delivers another slow-burn domestic drama in this movie about patriarchal insecurity and helplessness.The film isn't as gripping as ""A Separation,"" but it's still a fascinating character study of a middle aged actor whose wife is assaulted (the details of her assault remain vague, both to him and to the audience) and sets off on a grim mission to seek vengeance on the attacker in whatever way it presents itself. Juxtaposed to these scenes are ones showing him perform in an Iranian production of ""Death of a Salesman,"" the ultimate male mid-life crisis story. Like watching a car accident in slow motion, we see him move closer and closer to his goal even as his wife wants him to quit and we gain some sympathy, however slight, for the attacker. As in ""A Separation,"" Farhadi constructs a complicated set of characters with complicated emotions, not interested in good vs. bad or even right vs. wrong, suggesting instead that perhaps everything is to a greater or lesser degree a shade of gray. But the story he builds around these events isn't as compelling as ""A Separation,"" so the film doesn't have that earlier one's dramatic punch.Winner of the 2016 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, though the excellent German film ""Toni Erdmann"" really should have won.Grade: A-"

Every line of dialog is realistic. The acting is superb. The twists of the story are not forced, rather fit organically with the story and how the characters think and receive information. The subject matter makes it hard not to vilify the antagonist but Farhadi manages to do so by shedding light on their layered character and motives. Just as in real life, the people who do evil are not pure evil themselves.The realistic portrayal of the movie also makes watching the movie a self-exploration journey. You can't help but put yourself into the shoes of the characters and think what you would have done differently."

" Who Does Your Makeup?
",0.0,0.906,2017-07-24 00:00:00,6,"The Salesman"" has a lot going for it, and I understand why the Academy voters felt good about honoring it with an Oscar. The drama is tense, and the morality is surely correct. Revenge is a blunter of other, more civilized emotions. I can't buy the whole package, however, because it doesn't fulfill its promise of matching the trauma within a contemporary urban marriage to the framing medium of Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman."" I would have been content to follow the Iranian couple's drama alone, without the ""clever"" adjunct of the American classic, but since writer-director Farhadi draws such attention to Miller's play, I found myself constantly distracted by his misunderstanding of certain primary facets of that play.I realize several major critics, including A.O. Scott of the NY Times, have lauded how Farhadi uses ""Death of a Salesman"" to illuminate his tale of a modern rape and revenge--most of them laying stress on the ""sales"" aspect of one or more of the movie's characters who present a false facade to the world. Frankly, that's a very generalized reading, one idea plucked from the many themes at work in ""The Salesman."" To me, the only scene in Miller's play that connects with ""The Salesman"" is in Willy Loman's hotel room, when his son Biff learns that his dad has a hooker in the bathroom. To his credit, Farhadi shows that exact scene for a time, but this focus, while apt as far as it goes, overlooks the deeper side of Willy, that his entire life is devoted to a false idol, an illusion, the ""American dream"" of every salesman, of making one's way in the world ""on a smile and a shoeshine."" To Willy Loman, the only thing that matters on this earth is ""to be well liked."" Where does this factor into ""The Salesman""? None of the characters exemplifies that jovial spirit, verbosity, and fake good humor that characterize the salesman type. I kept wondering why Farhadi kept referencing Miller's play while leaving this out. But then he doesn't seem to have studied the play, or he wouldn't have cast such a youthful ""healthy"" leading man to play Willy. Nor would any theater director have permitted Shahab Hosseini to play a 1940s American traveling salesman with that beard! (A more believable Willy might be the elderly rapist who appears later in the film, but we never learn much about him, and he's not playing the part for the theater troupe.)Both of the Lomans are miscast. They are nearly 30 years too young, a serious matter for characters with a lifelong devotion to the capitalist creed and a nearly paid-off mortgage. The makeup artists have to work overtime to try (unsuccessfully) to age them, drawing attention to another strange detail. Do Iranian actors not do their own makeup? I'm not speaking of pampered film stars, but of so-called ""legit"" actors. Western actors take it for granted that, except for highly unusual cosmetic effects, the actor is responsible for his/her own makeup. I wondered if this was a movie director's wrong assumption about stage practice.None of this absolutely ruins what is strong in this film. It is certainly worth our time to witness city life in contemporary Iran, even if it is a glum vision overall. The tautness of the one-on-one encounters is mesmerizing. You can't look away. In the interaction of husband and wife, one can see all the glaring omissions and missteps that doom the couple--and may save viewers many hours of marriage counseling."
" The impact of random violence explored through the relationship of one man and one woman
",-0.6249,-0.9945,2017-07-20 00:00:00,7,"More in Sorrow than in Anger. I saw Asghar Farhadi's 'The Salesman' 5 days after the terrorist attacks in Manchester, as pictures of the victims were plastered all over the press in a basic violation of their privacy. 'The Salesman' explores the impact of a random act of violence on a marriage. In the wake of the attack, the victim's needs are entirely overlooked as her husband usurps the drama and makes it about himself: his sense of 'his' territory being invaded and polluted, his fragile identity, his anger, his hatred, his violence, his desire for revenge - all of which override the needs and wishes of the actual victim who, ultimately, does not want anyone else to be hurt in her name. In the last century 90% of the victims of war have been civilians - a large proportion of them women and children. In civil conflicts, from Ireland to Bosnia, it is often civilians - particularly women - who build informal bridges between communities. Yet they have been historically excluded from formal peace processes which are brokered between the warring parties - invariably men - this despite research showing that negotiations which include women are more successful. The Salesman explores all this through the psychology of one relationship: a subtle and timely film."
" Nonsensical
",0.0,0.9425,2017-07-17 00:00:00,4,"I'm someone who really liked, ""A Separation,"" so I was looking forward to this film which has of course received high critical acclaim. The first half of this movie was compelling...what happened to the wife, and will they find the person who attacked her? But then when the ""explanation"" is given, it doesn't really make any sense, and the question really isn't answered. Why do I say that? Because the guy accused of attacking the wife doesn't seem like he'd be able to do it. So what is the explanation for that? There is no explanation. Oh well.So then I decide to watch the extra on the DVD, where the director explains what he was trying to accomplish. This will surely help me understand this picture better! But it didn't. Apparently, to really ""get"" this film, you have to be well-versed in the play ""Death of a Salesman,"" (which I read in high school, by the way), which is also being performed by an acting troupe in this movie. Seriously! So I guess I just wasn't smart enough to appreciate this film. I guess all the critics who loved it and the Academy who gave it the Best Foreign Film Oscar are much smarter and hipper than me."
" An interesting alternative title might have been ""Shame""
",0.4019,-0.9826,2017-07-13 00:00:00,7,"This won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2017. Its director and script writer Asghar Farhadi is celebrated throughout the world as a great talent. I can see why. He's original and he gets great performances from his actors. Nonetheless I had to force myself to stay with this. It was so depressing in a most annoying way. The fear and the nearly all-consuming self-loathing that Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) experiences after being assaulted in her own bathroom is in part culturally based, as is the plot of her husband Emad (Shahab Hosseini) for a secretive revenge.Rana's fear is real because she doesn't know who assaulted her, and part of her shame is understandable since she carelessly opened her door of their apartment without knowing for sure who was coming up. But a significant part of her shame is because the more conservative interpretations of Islam (and other tribal religions as well, by the way) blame the woman if she is raped. This complexity of emotions is part of what no doubt fascinated many viewers.But I stayed with the movie, or actually I returned to it the next day. I was surprised at the resolution; I was surprised at Emad's sense of guilt. Yes, a man should be there to protect his wife, and perhaps if had been quicker at the market nothing would have happened. And perhaps there is guilt because he didn't investigate the circumstances of the apartment rental more thoroughly. (Apparently the previous tenant was a prostitute.) So in a sense they moved into a house of prostitution, as it were. And it is not beside the point to realize that Emad is playing Willie Lohman in a small theatre production of Arthur Miller's acclaimed play, ""The Death of a Salesman,"" a character who is ashamed because he sees himself as a failure.Again we can see the complexities that Farhadi insists upon.Okay here are my problems with the movie. First though I should say that viewers who are not Iranian and not Muslim including myself may very well miss some of the subtleties and preconceptions of the action.1. Why the ambiguity about the rape? Or maybe it was clear and I wasn't able to discern that.2. Why is the guilty party a character who almost certainly could not commit the rape? (He could barely get up the stairs.)3. We know why Emad and Rana don't go to the police. (Only shame will result possibly without ever catching the perp.) However Emad's revenge plan of humiliating the assailant seems elaborate and slow to action. After all Emad has overwhelming evidence as to who did it. He just has to find him.4. The culprit's truck just sits there and then they move it. Is would seem that best strategy would be to report the truck as being parked illegally (do that yourself if necessary since you have the keys), call the police and see who shows up.But again I don't live in Tehran so I really don't know what would have been the best way to proceed. What I do know is that Farhadi might have guided the general viewer less opaquely.Bottom line: definitely worth seeing, but I suspect Farhadi's ""A Separation"" (2011) which I haven't seen is a better film.--Dennis Littrell, author of the movie review book, ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote"""
" When the realistic right and an emotional wrong collides.
",-0.5574,0.9943,2017-06-24 00:00:00,7,"This is one of the last films I watched as I cleared almost all the titles of this year's Oscars. It is a French-Iranian co-production, but selected and won the Academy Awards for Iran. From the well know filmmaker of that region whose film had already won the same award in the not so past. I'm not just addicted to Hollywood. I'm a film fanatic because I give equal preference to films of the whole world. So I have seen as many as this year's submission for the Oscars in the category of the Foreign Language Films. And there are lots better films than this, that even did not make into the final five. From my perspective, this is an okay film, even comparing with the rest of the fellow nominees, including that I thought that would win, 'Under Sandet'. The mess is all because of Trump effect, as same reason 'Moonlight' to win the main trophy.At least it was not an average film like 'A Separation', though not a masterpiece like 'The Past' that did not even nominated for the Oscars. It stands between them. The title name is not exactly relevant to the story. But it helped to extend the plot for an extra 20-30 minutes. An unnecessary subplot, which really were the boring parts. Or you can say, just to attract the western audience with their ingredient and that worked out as planned for the filmmakers. Except those theatre portions, the rest of the film and its storyline looked like I was watching a French thriller.It is about a young couple who are forced to relocate to another house after their apartment building was declared not safe anymore for some kind of construction taking place in the nieghbourhood which is affecting it. The man is managing his job at a school as a teacher and the remaining time as a theatre artist along with his wife. The life was as usual, till one day something bad happens to his wife at home in his absence. Now he's raged to find the culprit, but once if he did what happens and how the story ends was the another twist.❝It's obvious you're not the one who found your wife the other day, otherwise you wouldn't say that.❞It was a very slow start. I mean the opening scene was like racy. And then following, it slowed to build the momentum. That does not mean the characters were developed so well. It only moves forward with constructing what are all needed for later parts. Once it enters the third act, the scenario changes. It looked like another film, another genre. Too tense moment and tight plot for the grand finale. Yep, that is the part makes this film to forget everything you saw in the earlier.Whatever happened in that part, I felt it was right, though I think culturally it differs the outcome. I mean, that's not philosophically the Iran we know or the religion they worship. You can say the western films badly portrayed them in their films, but if you look at their history, the film ending was shocking. So I thought, the end chaos was for among themselves. If the outsiders (westerners) were involved, it would have been a differently dealt.Very good performances. But not perfectly written screenplay as I pointed out a few things in the earlier paragraphs. And another thing was, the character, particularly the mysterious one, I was not satisfied how it had been developed. He enters the frame only at the last moment. The narration was very suspense and a bit thriller, but then all the sudden everything comes crumbling down since the end was very near to cease the procession. My point is, how that X man was netted does not make sense in reality. Being a film, it has no problem at all.So, it was a good film, but not as good as it was praised or won the Oscars. Yeah, definitely worth a watch. The setting was very good, except the ending, as the opinion differs from people to people and the amount of damage on how to deal with such situation. Overall, a little good message at the end, but not exactly a moral message as it brings more destruction towards the GOOD over the BAD which always win with a strong sentimental grip, no matter whoever involved in it.6.5/10"
" The Academy did a great job and Farhadi deserved it
",0.6249,0.6983,2017-06-17 00:00:00,9,First of all let me tell you that don't mix up yourself trying to find clues between the story of this movie and the original Arthur Miller's play because the plot has another layer inside and that is The Cow (1969) which you can see to grasp it. Of course that film is among 1001 films you must see list by itself. Only remember that this is an Asghar Farhadi's film so you have to expect something like A Separation or even the better About Elly. Secondly unlike what some are saying the Academy did a good job by choosing this movie over others just like what happened in Cannes film festival when The Salesman won two prizes for best screen play and best actor while for example Toni Erdmann didn't win anything at all. What critics are saying is proving that too. They said about Toni Erdmann for example that it is a dull prolonged version of The Birdman (2014). One critic was saying that when finished watching it he felt just like watched the Birdman once again and of course a much more prolonged and dulled version. On the other hand Variety is praising The Salesman and it's director Asghar Farhadi as he is a very smart director. Also The Salesman grossed more than the other nominees in it's world wide screening and even with fewer theaters comparing to the others and also IMDb users' higher ratings all are proving that the Academy did a great job.One signal which i can give you why Variety is praising Farhadi is when in the movie for the first time the protagonist Emad meets the old man who is the antagonist. There you can see that Emad doesn't know the old man at all and is not aware a bit that this is the man who attacked his wife. But in the continue how the truth is unfold and how everything reveals to him is what proves that Farhadi is not an ordinary director and that he really deserved his second Oscar and all the praising by Variety and others. If he was an ordinary director something by accident for example was to happen to reveal the story but it's not. And from this point the horror and suspense is beginning and that's what Farhadi is master in. You just remember that Farhadi is the Hichcock of Asia and you never will say about his films ordinary again. At the end of the movie when the old man is trapped by the now monstrous Emad there you can see all the horror and suspense which you can not see in any other movie but only in a Hichcock's perhaps.
" A cultural enigma - or a psychological mess
",-0.3612,-0.5135,2017-06-13 00:00:00,6,"It's not often that we get to see the films made by Iranian crews, starring Iranian actors and filmed in Iran. And, for a non-expert viewer like myself, the ""Iranian world"" is more or less terra incognita, which, considering all the political turmoil and notions of religious radicalism surrounding the country, makes one expect Iran to be something like what Argo showed us: a place where ruthless brutes are ready to kill and destroy everything that doesn't conform with their views of the ideals of the Islamic Revolution.Per se, such dense atmosphere may be a rich ground on which art with the great cultural suspense could grow. And The Salesman clearly draws some of its power from our expectations of inadequate reaction on its premise. A theater production based on some Western author's play that involves hookers and implies the actress being undressed - we can clearly sense the tension around the topic. Especially since the word ""censorship"" has been uttered.But, despite all the strong hints from the film, it is not about government repressions and torch-light processions. It's about a particular crime against a particular person - and the way the person and those close to her choose to react. The film clearly tries to capitalize on the stark contrast between the Western ways of dealing with such things and the Iranian ways. I guess we were supposed to be perplexed by the complexity of the social traditions and prejudices that make things we see as simple and straightforward so contrived in Iran. And if that was the case, I think the movie would have deserved the praise it had received.Yet, instead of clearly showing us the hard dilemmas that the Iranian people face when dealing with certain crimes, The Salesman tries to get away with simply piling up a bunch of self-contradictory behavior from the female protagonist. So, instead of learning _why_ she's so reluctant to oppose the issue that befell her, we have to guess what's so wrong with her head if she constantly blames others for her problems and pushes them around while actively obstructing their attempts to find a proper solution. And even the final showdown, that might clear the matters once and for all, obscures them even more instead.It might be the case that the behavioral schizophrenia expressed by the movie characters is an accurate reflection of a latent mass psychosis taking place in the Iranian society, oppressed so much that they prefer to quietly lose their mind instead of venting their frustration. In that case this film, however inconsequential and bizarre, is a cultural enigma giving us an insight of how people live in totalitarian societies. However, with the directing so vague and inconcrete, the film might bear a different message entirely, in that case being just yet another example how people are affected by Stockholm syndrome or crumble under their own sense of victimness. Whichever interpretation is true is not for me to decide, but trying to sit on two totally different and unrelated chairs at the same, and doing that so clumsily, is clearly not what I call good cinema."

It won, and while accepting his Oscar, Farhadi reminded US citizens to view Iran as more than crazy ayatollahs. His latest movie, ""Forushande"" (""The Salesman"" in English) also won that award. This movie focuses on a different topic, but still important. The main characters are a couple starring in a production of ""Death of a Salesman"". Forced out of their apartment due to an impending collapse, they move into an apartment secured by a fellow actor. But when the wife gets assaulted, a series of events gets set in motion.The plot is intended to subtly mirror the plot of Arthur Miller's play, as cracks in the characters' lives begin to show. This is one movie that's all about subtlety. I highly recommend it. As for its Oscar win, the notable event was that Asghar Farhadi boycotted the ceremony to protest Donald Trump's Muslim ban, so he had astronaut Anousheh Ansari accept it in his stead. She read a letter from Farhadi condemning the Muslim ban. Of all the other submissions for the award, I've only seen ""Desierto"", which is also a good movie."

Farhadi gives us a very universal interpretation of the emotion of men and women, where the man wants revenge and women wants to forgive and forget.

Great Storytelling: The basic element for every movie to be successful is obviously entertainment, and we're not talking about cheap emotional Hollywood manipulation here, no no; this is not like Fast and Furious or Transformers crap. This is a very good example that shows that good cinema has not necessarily to be boring, we know movies are about emotion and excitement to; so this fine film takes us on a riveting ride that any viewer will suffer and enjoy at the same time.2. Flawless Cinematography crafting: It has also, a very neat craft in all technical aspects: Script, Directing, Performances, Photography, etc. You can feel since the beginning that you're seeing a very well crafted movie and surprisingly it makes justice AGAIN! To their director's reputation as if it were not already enough with his other 4 previous movies. This is a real talent (Asghar Farhadi) you have to recognize here.3. Political and Social Pertinence Critique: Real art has to be self-aware of his power to influence people and change society, so art-house movies have a very political subtext development. There's so many crucial subject matters and comments on this movie: Ethical and Moral limits, Revenge and Forgiveness, Women situation on Iranian society, Family Values, and so on.

" couple drama in an insecure world
",-0.4215,0.9847,2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Films are one good media for taking the pulse of a society at a certain moment in time, for surfacing explicitly or implicitly its problems, for making it known beyond borders of countries or cultures. Iran is a country little and badly known in the world. We may read or listen a lot about its politicians and external conflicts, we know very little about the day-to-day life in the country, about the problems, feelings and dreams of its people. This is why films coming from Iran raise interest and those coming from a fine film-maker as Ashgar Farhadi are among the best.Watching a film like The Salesman is an exercise not too different than the one we experience(d) when we are (were) watching in the 60s, 70s, 80s films coming from the Soviet Union, Poland, or other countries under Communist rule. It is important to watch what you see on screen to its most minuscule detail that can hide hints or symbols. It is even more important to think about what you cannot see on screen, which you know could not be said because of censorship, or maybe it was said and fell on the floor because of different types of pressure. This film is the story of a family drama triggered by the brutal attack on a married woman. She and her husband (both middle class intellectuals, amateur actors playing 'Death of a Salesman' in the evenings') do not go to the police to put a complain because they know the system is corrupt and biased against the woman, rather then protecting her and trying to find and punish the criminal. We are in the Middle East however, and honor plays an important role, so the husband engages in a personal vendetta which has as a goal not necessarily vengeance but recovering the honor of the victim and exposing the attacker to the blame of his own family. The subtle insertion of theater in film hints to many other aspects that are rather implicit than explicit - the attraction to the Western culture, the cosmetic changes brought to the play, actors, costumes in order to make it acceptable to the Islamic religious norms.There is another comparison to be made with another film that was a candidate this year at the Best Foreign Language Award at the Academy (which The Salesman won) - Paul Verhoeven's Elle. In both films we deal with aftermaths of brutal attacks on women - but what a difference between the attitude of the two women - and the reasons are clearly psychological and cultural.The film-making style looks familiar to viewers who have been exposed to Middle East cinema. The story telling, some of the dialogues, the relations between the characters reminded me dome of the Israeli 'burekas' movies, with families and neighbors interaction, with the mix of comedy and melodrama. Director Asghar Farhadi develops this approach much beyond its limits, aiming to reach a more international audience with the relation to Arthur Miller's play. He is helped by the splendid acting of his two lead actors Taraneh Alidoosti and Shahab Hosseini who both give expressive and discrete performances, full of controlled passion and dignity, which make the tough situations described on screen more easy to follow. I was less impressed by the final solution where life seems to follow its own rule and the characters lose voice in face of stronger forces. This sounded a little anti-climax and undecided. I will not say however more, in order to avoid telling too much about a film I do recommend to all viewers."

The world we've seen before in A Separation and Fireworks Wednesday. This time around the focus is on the shifting dynamics between a couple after the wife is assaulted by an unknown intruder. My take: very competently done with the usual Farhadi refinement. But somewhere along the way I thought the plot sagged just that wee bit. Not among his best, but still very good But hey, the guy won his second Oscar for it, after the one for A Separation in 2011. And that don't happen too often in the Best Foreign Film category.

" The best Salesman
",0.6369,0.9436,2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"This review of The Salesman is spoiler free**** (4/5)WRITER-DIRECTOR ASGHAR Farhadi, has formed his career based on three main points that are: simplicity, originality and beauty and after his Oscar winning feature A Separation, he has become a household name all around Iran, this of course is no exception with his excellent latest The Salesman. A rape/revenge tale that comes natural with Farhadi's excellent storytelling which is formed over the simplest ideas and it's wonderful. Set in Tehran which looks stunning thanks to a brightly coloured aesthetic, we open with Emad (Hosseini) and his young wife Rana (Alidoosti) who are forced to move out of their home after being damaged from building collapse only to find that their new home was formerly owned by a prostitute. Taraneh Alidoosti is excellent as Rana, her performance after being horrifically attacked is clingy and stand-off-ish but being the strong-willed woman that she is - just goes with it and wants to let it go, she doesn't report it. Shabab Hosseini is also flawless as Emad - he doesn't like the fact that Rana wants to let it go, worried for her safety he is tied up in an endless investigation, but it turns out that this once popular school teacher is now tempted by simple yet brutal revenge, and is caught in an amateurish investigation trying to tackle evidence around the unknown assailant.Farhadi handles this beautifully - he's become the director that even Hitchcock would want to have by his side. As much as being stunning on screen it's sometimes difficult to watch as Rana tries hard to deal with this traumatized state. Farhadi makes us wait giving us information when it's precisely necessary, and there is a moment when it does come more than necessary. In a drastically long-stretched climax the information given from the perpetrator is needed as Emad with no weapon - except for a threat from a mobile phone call - making it more straight forward than most thrillers. Though longer than it needs to be this is an excellently pulled off moment. Typically given, it ends the overbearing shadow of the slow burn. Though seemingly hard to show it Rana takes this as a difficulty to keep going with the stage redo of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (which is popular in Iran), Farhadi clueless, to its material. And not only that Emad's dwelt of Rana's trauma reigns it's strength over the film, Farhadi seems to be only focused on his attitude instead of hers. Which initially it should be the other way around; this could have flown much higher if Farhadi took that ability to present Rana's trauma instead of Emad's. But it still delivers.VERDICT: Farhadi's meticulous construction matches flawless performances and beautiful cinematography with solid participation into ordinary incidents and packs them into rich storytelling filled with resonant ideas."
" Brilliant film, but very grim
",-0.6236,0.9923,2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"The Iranian film Forushande was shown in the United States with the title The Salesman (2016). It was written and directed by Asghar Farhadi. The movie stars Taraneh Alidoosti as Rana Etessami, and Shahab Hosseini as her husband, Emad Etesami.Emad is a teacher, and he's also an actor who is co-starring, with his wife, in Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman. (That's why the title of the movie is The Salesman.) They appear to be a happy, loving couple until things start to go wrong. The movie opens with a potential disaster--their apartment building is collapsing. They're able to get out safely, but they need to find another apartment. A fellow cast member offers them an apartment, which he owns as a rental property. The problem is that the former tenant hasn't cleared her belongings out of the apartment, and, although she's never on screen, she is an ominous presence throughout the film.Things start to go wrong, and they ultimately spiral out of control. People have to make choices, and often they make the wrong choice. The film is superb--great direction, great acting, great cinematography. However, you won't leave the theater whistling a happy tune.We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It's really an interpersonal drama, so it should work well on the small screen. The Salesman won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film. I haven't seen all the other films that were nominated, but I think this film was the best foreign film I saw in 2016. Try to see it--it's truly a brilliant movie."

The story begins with a residential apartment building undermined by reckless construction. As a result, a Teheran schoolteacher/actor is forced to move into new accommodation with his actress wife, just as they open a stage production of Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman'. On Emad and Rana's second night in their new home, Rana leaves the door unlocked anticipating Emad's imminent return from the supermarket, and an intruder enters while she takes a shower. Rana suffers a head injury and concussion in a bathroom confrontation, before the stranger flees.In the claustrophobic atmosphere of Iran's sexually repressive culture, the ripples from this episode grow into a tsunami which threatens to overwhelm the lives of this sympathetic couple. While Rana hesitates to report the matter to the police due to a sense of shame, Emad sets about discovering the intruder's identity from clues left behind in the apartment. His journey into dangerous territory is observed in Farhadi's customary style, until the story arrives at a final act which is excruciating for its unbearable tension and emotional intensity."

" Farhadi does it again, in showing us another Iran
",0.0,-0.9675,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Asghar Farhadi's films A Separation (also Oscar gold) and About Elly (not Oscar-recognized, but pretty good nevertheless) were shocking films. Not just for their stories- Farhadi does excel in intense and gripping drama with a touch of mystery to them- but for the face they put on Iran, very different from what many viewers go in expecting. Where are the cries for jihad? The outcry against Great Satan? The plots to wipe Israel off the map? The burning people in the street? Why are they living in apartments and homes and not caves? Farhadi certainly does give us more of that here. Early on, we hear a cell phone go off with a very familiar ringtone, and the protagonists are performing Death of a Salesman. You might think the US is banning these people for a reason, but Farhadi's films show us that, apart from a big difference in government, Iranians themselves are like people anywhere. Substitute ""Muhammad"" for ""Jesus"" and ""Koran"" for ""Bible"" and his films could be set in Kansas or Mississippi.As for the ""intense and gripping drama with a touch of mystery"" part, The Salesman also delivers once again. This touches on the issue of violence against women, with the protagonist trying to uncover who assaulted his wife. But the film also deals, in a very human way, with the trauma his wife lives with in the aftermath. There is intensity in the climax- is there going to be revenge? The Salesman is no tasteless rape-and-revenge movie; it's a finely crafted drama that can be different things at once."
" Powerful and brilliantly executed
",0.7783,-0.9088,2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"Emad Etesami (Shahab Hosseini, ""About Elly"") and his wife Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti, ""Atomic Heart""), a childless married couple in their early thirties, are amateur actors playing the lead roles in a local production of Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman,"" a play in which a good man's virtue turns to hypocrisy and his marriage crumbles. Like Willy and Linda in Miller's play, the husband and wife in Asghar Farhadi's (""A Separation"") Oscar-nominated film The Salesman talk to each other, but it is always seemingly behind a veil until unforeseen events uncover buried aspects of each one's character that blurs the dividing line between the theater and real life.As well as being an actor, Emad is a high school literature teacher respected by his students who is first seen in a classroom discussion about the short story ""The Cow"" by Gholem-Hossein Sa'edi, an Iranian writer and political activist. When one of the students asks Emad, ""How does a man become a cow?"" Emad replies, ""Gradually,"" little realizing that his answer would become prophetic. The scene then suddenly shifts to a suburban apartment where Emad and Rana are seen running with other residents to escape the building's crumbling facade. In a politically-sounding exchange that somehow eluded the censors, Emad says, ""We ought to take a bulldozer, knock this whole thing down and start over,"" whereas a neighbor tells him, ""We already did that and this is what we got."" Fortunately, stage manager Babak (Babak Karimi, ""The Past"") helps the young couple find a vacant two-bedroom apartment on the top floor of a building but fails to tell them that the previous occupant, who has left most of her belongings behind, was a prostitute, described euphemistically in the film as ""a woman of many acquaintances."" When Emad is out one night, Rana lets a stranger into their apartment thinking it's her husband, and is assaulted in the shower.The incident takes place off-camera and the exact nature of the attack is never made clear. The event, however, puts a strain on their marriage. Like Willy Loman who is unable to give his wife and family the good things in life, Emad wonders why he was unable to protect his wife from assault and becomes irritated with her fear of being alone, a situation that disrupts his teaching schedule and, in one instance when she agrees to perform, causes him to cancel a performance of the play in the middle because of her breakdown. Speculating that his wife was attacked by a former client of the previous tenant, Emad does not report the incident to the police but takes it upon himself to track down the perpetrator using such clues as a cell phone, set of keys, and a pickup truck which the attacker carelessly left on their street. Determined to seek revenge and unwilling to see events from Rana's perspective, he berates her for letting a stranger into their apartment. When her feelings are marginalized, the film becomes more about the treatment of women than about what happened or who committed the crime, revealing how a man's anger, bruised ego, and disdain for his wife's feelings threaten the very thing he is striving to protect.To Farhadi, the key to understanding the film is empathy. He says, ""When you try to make your movie as close as possible to real life, you give the audience the opportunity to watch it from different aspects. I'm always working towards empathy,"" he says, ""even with the characters that do wrong. The films where characters are heroic and do lots of great things are satisfying and comfortable to audiences. But I want audiences to put themselves in the shoes of characters who have done something wrong."" Regardless of whose point of view you ultimately sympathize with, The Salesman is a powerful and brilliantly executed film about revenge and its consequences that enhances Farhadi's reputation as one of the most important filmmakers of our time."
" another Farhadi masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9796,2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Iranian writer/director Asghar Farhadi won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for his 2011 A Separation, and with his latest (also Oscar nominated), he proves yet again that his unique approach to family/domestic dramas might best be described as simmering suspense artistry. He certainly knows how to tell a story and structure a film for maximum impact.Shahab Hosseini (A Separation) and Taraneh Alidoosti (About Elly) star as Emad and Rana, a normal and seemingly happily married couple. One morning, some heavy equipment jeopardizes the stability of their apartment building and they escape to the streets. Husband and wife are both performing in a community theatre production of Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"" and at that evening's rehearsal, one of their castmates, Babak (Babak Karimi) offers the couple the use of a rooftop apartment  he has recently evicted the tenant.Of course, this bit of luck comes with some baggage  specifically, the baggage and belongings of the previous tenant who (unseen to viewers) keeps telling Babak she will return for her stuff. Meanwhile, the neighbors inform Emad and Rana that the previous tenant and her ""many acquaintances"" (paying clients, if you get my drift) will not be missed. This history comes into play when one evening a home invasion leaves Rana dazed, injured and being treated at a local hospital. This sets off the cultural commentary about the roles and power of Iranian men vs women, as well as a psychological study of wounded pride, a need for revenge, and a scarred psyche who wishes to be neither alone nor coddled.The strained marital relationship has some interesting parallels with the scenes depicted in the Miller play, and there are also a few key moments in the build-up  moments of subtlety for the discerning viewer. Foreshadowing occurs in a seemingly humorous moment when one of Emad's students asks during class, ""How does a man become a cow?"", and Emad answers ""Gradually."" A throwaway line is never really that in a Farhadi script.Most of the film centers on how Emad and Rana react to the traumatic event, and for the first two-thirds, it's Emad's movements that we follow. However, during the extraordinary final act, Rana becomes the focus and there is a tremendous performance from Farid Sajjadi Hosseini as an older gent in a key role. So much raw human nature is on display here – pride, revenge, forgiveness, trust, weakness, etc. It's the type of film that has much going on even during the parts that might seem slow on the surface. Farhadi is an exceptional filmmaker, and evidently, he will just continue to prove it so."

" Depressing Iranian Drama
",-0.3818,-0.8151,2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Emad and Rana are a middle class couple living in an apartment building in Iran, which, for some unexplained reason, is being demolished without evacuating the tenants first. I guess the building codes in the Middle East are not as strict as here in America. The brooding husband and wife are forced to move to another place which had a mysterious previous occupant. Apparently, the woman who lived there was a prostitute with an extensive clientele. Emad is on his way home to the new domicile when his wife suffers a vicious, violent attack. Apparently, she has been mistaken for the last tenant. The couple are an actor and actress who are performing the very American play by Arthur Miller, ""Death of a Salesman."" They are working at a small theater which, I guess, is the Iranian equivalent to off Broadway here in New York. Emad also works as a school teacher to pay their living expenses. The film moves back and forth between the stage play and Emad's obsession with catching his wife's attacker. This is a thoroughly depressing journey, and although the lead actors are excellent, I was totally drained emotionally by the not so happy ending. The Salesman is nominated for best Foreign film at the Oscar's, but personally I would pick ""A Man Called Ove"" as a better choice."
" a crime film, a morality story, thrilling, tragic, full of real human beings up there on the screen
",-0.5267,-0.7738,2017-02-23 00:00:00,9,"I'm sure the play Death of a Salesman has something to do with the rest of this story, but aside from them both having a woman (in this film's story, off-screen) who has male 'customers', I still don't know yet. While The Salesman didn't hit the same emotional peak that A Separation did, this was drawn out in a gut-wrenching sort of way like that film does, where things are so realistic and yet at the same time there's always harsh and sorrowful pathos going on that we can be hooked into the furthering plight of these characters. It's in a way a crime film too, only it's a personal one.Farhadi's storytelling is close to a blend at its most pure of a kind of neo-realism and a film-noir, to draw out the old-time film comparisons; it's about seemingly every-day people who try to lead and good and productive lives (the main couple here are actors and the man is also a schoolteacher, while the other characters that come in the second half of the story are working class as well), and one terrible damn incident brings the world crashing down.As in A Separation the performances are particularly strong, but what I've noticed in these two films is how much Farhadi pays attention to the emotional lives of his women; Hosseini gets his dramatic moments, but he is mostly reacting to things, and tries to be tough and a MAN about things, while Alidoosti's Rana has to internalize this experience, and she is the one who really goes through a full, devastating arc through the film where, by near the end, she's become more of the grown-up and trying to see some reason and let sleeping dogs lie and such, though she's still scarred as well. Perhaps, in thinking it now, the Salesman story is significant as well in that that story is about a man and woman being torn apart by the man being so stuck in his ways, unable to see any other way to go about how to live his life. Hosseini's character wants to do what's right (for a few reasons the cops cant be called after this attack on his love happens as the critical turning point), but his idea for revenge or payback is spurred further by his anger and frustration. Or, to put it more simply: what happens when a family is torn apart by the truth - this, by the way, becomes what may or may not end up being the climax of this film.This is a heavy film, but rewarding because the actors are living so strongly in these moments, and we can empathize with them as well (which is the provocative part, as if Farhadi may be challenging us or himself or both to wonder) as a key character in the third act of the story, where it reaches its resolution - not to mention back where the story began, in an apartment that is unihabitable due to a man-made destruction - and because Farhadi is so vigorous in making practically every scene count. It's a painfully human tragedy (with maybe one or two minor laughs, almost like brief respites) that is able to be interesting, occasionally extremely and uncomfortably thrilling, and naturalistic at the same time, which is difficult to pull off. I may not rush to see The Salesman again, but I'm glad Farhadi continues to make films, and I'm more hopeful it'll win at the Oscars precisely because it is *not* political (except, of course, for how intensely it *is* a feminist story, simply in the sense that it's an Iranian film that feels deep compassion for its female co-protagonist)."
" I expected more
",0.0,0.9239,2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"I love Iranian movies and the Separation is one of my favorites. Somehow with the Salesman it did not work out. The script is original but the story develops so slowly and drowns out. You do not feel the real drama and the true massage behind it. The director probably wanted to repeat his success using the same means as in the Separation but it lacks originality, something thrilling and insightful acting."
" Watch, watch, watch.
",0.0,0.5357,2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Without it yet being an actual problem, watching this felt like Farhadi has become a bit too self-aware, dangerously close to falling into the black hole of his own creativity. A tad too stylized, a lashing too structured, The Salesman is still a profoundly personal movie, anthropocentric to almost a fault without ever crossing that line; a fine balance the filmmaker has proved to be masterful at keeping.The story is simple, held elegantly against the backdrop of Miller's Death of a Salesman; a play in which our heroes are portraying the main characters as a recreational activity. The protagonists' plight is being juxtaposed with that of Willy's and Linda's, elevating the sudden darkness befalling their happiness to an allegory pertaining the small; those innocuous details that can either support or break a union in the aftermath of a domestic crisis.Much like Willy's burden of mediocrity, Emad is being defined by his own perceived inability to successfully tend to his wife, Rana, in the aftershock of an attack that quickly adorns their skin with wrinkles of instability. Cracks appear, on their walls of their home, the build of their marriage, the very foundation of his mental equilibrium and in the process of his wife's healing, the tables are slowly being turned.Rana lifts her chin in subtle pride as she dusts the burden of self-pity off her bruised shoulders and ventures to reestablish herself in a state of weightless normalcy. All the while, Emad seems to be caving under the pressure of his own contradicting duality -- a man who desperately seeks to regain control of a suddenly derailed life, a husband needing to protect, shield and amend in vengeful anger while, simultaneously, mending in kindness, fear, and worry. Two people journeying through life side by side are now being torn to opposite poles in a way subepidermal enough to have you fearing for their relationship without even realizing at what point exactly you reached that emotional status.Farhadi's signature move, it would seem.My personal gripe. The Salesman cuts deep without pushing -- a beautiful movie featuring some stellar acting by almost everyone involved, no argument there. However, and much to my disappointment, I found it falling short during the third act.Emad's inner turmoil leads to many spasmodic, irrational reactions from the beginning of the tale but during the last part of the film, the character becomes unrealistic, like the final scene had been already filmed and Farhadi needed to mold something out of nothing to just get us there.Underwhelming finish aside, the overall outcome is still worth of tremendous praise, even if, for some of you who might end up sharing my views, it finishes not in thunderous applause but a thoughtful sigh of contentment."
" Actor avenges attack on wife.
",-0.4767,-0.9986,2017-02-17 00:00:00,10,"In The Salesman the actors starring in an Iranian stage production of Death of a Salesman live parallel tragedies on and off stage. The first shot is of a rumpled marriage bed, the setting for intimacy and sexual drama. Those values adhere even when the situation is a theatre set. The narrative unwinds from a reported sexual scene, where the heroine is somehow violated by a stranger in her shower. Using an American classical play sets off an immediate contrast between the Iranian and American cultures. The Arthur Miller play anatomizes the shallowness and materialism of American capitalism. It establishes a struggling low-born salesman — Willy Loman — in the function of the traditionally high-born tragic hero. An Iranian production of the American classic would be expected to emphasize the superiority of the Iranian culture. Hence the gaudy summary of the US in the set's neon Casino and Bowling signs. But the choice of a Miller play pays respect to the freedom that political theatre enjoys in America. Hero Emad is delayed that fateful night when he has to stay to deal with the state censors who want to make three cuts in the script. As a literature teacher he's again frustrated when the school rejects his three texts as inappropriate for his teenage boys class. Despite that puritanism the Iranian society is also riven with sexual temptation. Emad explains that the woman who objected to sitting beside him in the taxi had probably been discomfited, perhaps even molested, by another man on another shared taxi ride. The pictures Emad finds on a pupil's cell phone are probably like the raunchy stuff on American boys' phones. At the other extreme the pathetic old man is tempted to sin by the sight of the showering Rana.That schoolboy's not having a father sets a pattern of missing or questioned manhood. The supporting actress has a little son but is separated from her husband. The little boy's obtrusive glasses suggest a preternatural vision, lending weight to his line: ""If my father phones say I'm not in. I like Mommy more."" The boy lives his mother's life so completely that he not only attends her rehearsals but joins the curtain call onstage. The central issue is how Emad and Rana deal with her violation. If Willy Loman's downfall is his seduction by the American myth of popularity, Emad's is for the Iranian myth of male honour. Because the man is held dishonoured by his wife's shame Rana is more traumatized by the old man's appearance in her shower than an American wife would be. Not till the end do we realize that she was not raped and only injured herself by falling through the glass shower door. To avoid further shame Rana determines not to go to the police. She remains traumatized by the experience, too ashamed to return to her professional activity of being watched onstage by men. With his honour pre-eminently at stake, Emad resolves upon revenge. He tracks down and traps the villain. When Rana sees him, she determines to prevent Emad's plan to shame him before his wife of 35 years, his daughter and her fiancé. ""If you tell them we are finished."" Emad seems to accept her decision. A largely decent man himself, when he sees the old man and his family he relents and seems ready to let him leave. But he has another score to settle. He gives him back the money he left behind, then slaps him. That last action pushes the ill geezer over the edge. With his death, Rana's love for Emad is finished too. His insensitivity to her trauma was bad enough — It's a guy thing — but his insistence upon revenge, a fatal excess, is to her unforgivable. Like Rana's shame, Emad's revenge is based on the Iranian principle that a woman serves her man's honour. After her initial trauma Emad seems to feel more violated than his wife. After she labours over a special dinner Emad refuses to eat it because it was bought with the intruder's money. At the heart of Emad's characterization is his exchange with a student over a story: ""How does a man turn into a cow?"" ""Very gradually."" Determined not to be a cow, a wus, Emad plunges bullheaded toward a revenge that costs a man's life and Emad his marriage. Against the current of both Iranian and American culture, this film emphasizes the woman's merit as a civilizing, humanizing force.The first Miller scene we see is where his son catches Willy in a hotel room with a local floozy. That costs Willy son Biff's respect forever. Emad's vengeful plan is to similarly expose the old man before his wife and daughter. It's as If Emad took his strategy from the play instead of from his wife's better sense. The omission of Death from the film's title points to another key difference. We see Emad as Willy, dead, in his coffin, while wife Linda grieves at the paradox that she has just paid off their mortgage: ""We are free!"" But the film ends on Emad staring stolidly, vacantly, as his makeup is peeled off. The character is dead but the actor is alive. But his marriage is dead and so Emad is no longer quite alive. He's an image of death in life, literally alive but emotionally dead. His revenge killed him along with his enemy. In Death of a Salesman we see the themes and events through to Willy's death. In The Salesman the death is omitted because at the most superficial level the hero remains — however emptily — alive."
" Iran in a Microcosm
",0.0,0.9592,2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"The draw of director Asghar Farhadi oeuvre at times feels very political. The widening cultural, religious and diplomatic gap between the United States and Iran has thus far been stabilized by chilly detente of necessity. Yet if we take our current political climate seriously, such distanced estrangement wont likely last past the New Year.Still film artists like Farhadi, Mohsen Makhmalbaf and the late Abbas Kiarostami have been at the forefront of this complex sandbox of truces and tough talk, making films about Iranian society that easily find reception among America's leftist intelligentsia. Their work, while often critical of Iranian society, nevertheless channels some powerful messaging. They often feel like cries for temperance and peace in a world that becomes ever more belligerent with each passing moment.The Salesman doesn't break that continuity, once again garnering a cultural exchange while engaging its audience with an innately human story. The film begins abruptly with a young couple, Rana (Alidoosti) and Emad Etesami (Hosseini) being forced out of their apartment in the middle of the night along with their neighbors. Their building has become unstable after an earthquake and they are desperate to find a place to stay. Babak (Karimi), a fellow player in the couple's production of ""Death of a Salesman,"" suggests they replace one of his tenants who has been struggling to pay her rent.To explain more would ruin the discovery of one of the most morally complex and painfully human stories since A Separation (2011) to come across the screen. All of the character choices seem genuine and perfectly understandable given the circumstances yet the buildup from those decisions come back in interesting and often devastating ways.Emad, a schoolteacher, approaches most of his problems through an amalgam of analysis and judgment yet the implications of the script trap him in a doleful dilemma he simply can't shake. So too does the script trap the sensitive Rana, who at a pivotal moment becomes fractured like the windows of the couple's slowly collapsing apartment. She suffers through sullen drifts and withdrawals, angry outbursts and bouts of pity; and does so through a filter of feminine devoir.As our female lead, and really, our emotional interpreter, Taraneh Alidoosti's is frightfully on point. Her continual work with Farhadi over the years seems to have given her the ability to really take chances with this role. Her every gaze feels like a provocation and her character's improbable honor wells with a sense of sad power thanks largely to her expressive face.The fact that The Salesman features Arthur Miller's ode to the common man is very appropriate indeed. While the play within the movie balances themes of justice, trust and the abstraction of political violence, the film takes those same themes and filters them through the emptiness of personal revenge. How appropriate then that Emad, plays Willy Loman, a character who's powerlessness leads to his ruination.Much like About Elly (2009) however, The Salesman has a habit of reaching its moral conclusion far before reaching its actual, physical conclusion. The third act, while strong and refreshingly classic in its humanism, can't help but feel like it's dawdling; leaving its human frailties exposed like bleaching bones. Additionally, in today's political climate, Farhadi's chase for universality can't help but look like he's purposely pandering to his western audience. Don't get me wrong, the film is still very much a depiction of modern Iran in microcosm, but now there's a lens of compromised diplomacy.That said, The Salesman is still a strong work of social commentary that approaches the staid, workmanlike zenith of Farhadi's best works. Shahab Hosseini and especially Taraneh Alidoosti are pitch perfect as a young, childless couple that struggle with tough moral dilemmas and the feckless invisible structures that force them to plow through them."
" 4.5 stars... Justice, Iran-style: a human psychological action movie for the mind
",0.5267,0.9962,2017-02-11 00:00:00,9,"""The Salesman"" (2015 release from Iran; 125 min.) brings the story of Emad and Rana, a married couple who enjoy their lives ""in the culture"", as a neighbor comments, and they are the lead performers of a local staging of Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"". As the movie opens, Emad and Rana are forces to leave their building as the walls are close to collapse (due to nearby construction). An acquaintance in the theater group is able to get them a new apartment on little to no notice, but doesn't mention the previous tenant was known as a ""woman with may acquaintances"". Then one day, when Rana is home alone, someone rings the bell. Rana, thinking it's her husband, lets the person come up and in the apartment. The person assaults Rana in the shower. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.This is the latest movie from Iranian writer-director Asghar Farhadi, whose previous work includes the outstanding ""A Separation"" (which won Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar) and ""The Past"", just to name those. Here Farhadi examines the consequences of an assault on the marriage of a young couple. Keep in mind the movie is set in Tehran, where even with its more progressive leanings in certain circles (like those ""in the culture""), the shame of a sexual assault cannot be overestimated. The question is of course, who did this heinous crime? and will the person be brought to justice? I am biting my tongue and shan't reveal any further. Just be aware that the second hour of the movie is like a human psychological action movie for the mind. The lead performances are outstanding: Shahab Hosseini as Emad (he won Best Actor at last year's Cannes Film Festival), and Taraneh Alidoosli as Rana. This movie has won major acclaim after acclaim since its premiere at Cannes, and is rightfully nominated for this year's Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar. Here's hoping it wins. As a complete aside, there is only the slightest hint of the (supposedly) oppressing religious culture in Iran: the people portrayed in the movie are quite ""normal"" by Western standards. Is it really so in today's Iran? I haven't the faintest idea, as I've never visited Iran myself.""The Salesman"" finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, but by no means anywhere close to a sell-out. I can only hope that as positive word-of-mouth gets around, more and more people will want to check it out. If you've seen ""A Separation"", in spirit very similar to ""The Salesman"", or if you are simply in the mood for a top notch human psychological drama that happens to come from Iran, don' hesitate and check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Salesman"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Farhadi, the master of family drama strikes again
",-0.3612,0.9926,2017-02-06 00:00:00,6,"""Forushande"" or ""The Salesman"" is an Iranian movie that premiered last year. It runs for slightly over two hours and was written and directed by Ashgar Farhadi, who has been among Iran's finest filmmakers for a long time now, even if it took until his Oscar win for the world to finally really pay him attention/tribute. For me, it's between him and Panahi who is the top filmmaker from this troubled country right now. As for the cast here, I cannot say I am familiar with anybody, but this is certainly my loss as they are all doing a pretty good job and interestingly enough, the probably biggest supporting actor in here is somebody who worked as an editor for a long time until he finally started acting in film. But the best performance here comes from Shahab Hosseini of course and if he wasn't already, he now is a definite part of the Iranian acting elite. Lets take a look at the story. A couple of artists move to a new apartment where a prostitute (interesting how they avoid using this word) lived in before and the result of a tragic coincidence is that a man suggests she still lives there and forces her to have sex with him. The money he left there afterward certainly implies that rape was never an intentional factor. So it is a crime where really nobody can be blamed. The open door, the previous tenant's background, the client's harshness, it all played together in a wrong-place wrong-time kind of scenario.Rape sure is an important subject at the Academy Awards this year as Isabelle Huppert is a nominee and possible dark horse for the win for her performance as a rape victim in ""Elle"". And this Iranian movie here is in a similar position at the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Oscars. It is not the front runner, but there is definitely the option that it may cause an upset to the German entry as Huppert may cause to Stone. Now back to this one here: Shahab Hosseini is the heart and soul of the film and he is in basically every scene of these 120 minutes. He does a magnificent job and I hope this somehow gets him parts in Hollywood movies. If he wants to, that is. There is no denying he brings the talent to (co-)star in blockbuster films. As for the film itself, I think it was a good watch throughout, but it may get slightly overrated as a whole because of how impressive the last 30 minutes were, especially the first scene between Hosseini and Karimi, which was absolute edge-of-seat material. Sadly, there was an occasional length in the first 90 minutes, which is why I would describe this movie ""only"" as a good film overall, not a great film. I still believe it is more Oscar-worthy than Toni Erdmann, another good film that did not have the great moments this one here does.Finally some more words on ""The Salesman"". I have not seen ""Death of a Salesman"" and I must say the theater parts did the least for me, maybe because these take away from the pure moments of interaction between the two protagonists, or maybe also because I had no idea why Farhadi chose ""Death of a Salesman"" as the play here. Maybe you need to have seen it to understand all the references in this film's plot. But even if you have not like myself, it is still a very tense, enjoyable (sounds not like the right word to be honest) watch in its entirety and Farhadi once again proves that he is a real master of family dramas right now, as good as it gets in depicting life and the way it changes when drastic events may destroy the harmony and everyday life. Highly recommended, for Hosseini's performance alone. And Farhadi's background also takes us into a country where we know very little about, so this insight into society and communities is informative on a level where you actually learn new aspects every scene."

His humanism and naturalism place him on equal footing with the Dardenne brothers and the fact that he's doing his social character cinema in Iran makes him even more important to a Western viewer. This film quietly unfolds, taking its time. Not having any notion of the plot going in allowed me to sink into Farhadi's rhythms and sense of place and allowed his turns of story to take me by surprise. Eventually, the current reaches an incredibly charged, tense, and emotional last act that never once falls into traditional narrative traps. The final few shots are masterfully simple and perfectly contextualized, supporting a whole film's worth of meaning in and of themselves.My adoration for Farhadi remains."
" The apathetic characters and the confused audience
",-0.5423,-0.9628,2017-01-30 00:00:00,5,"Let's start with the fact that I like 'About Elly' from Farhadi and believe it still is his finest to date. Unfortunately, 'The Salesman' is a Felix Baumgartner-ish free- fall. Farhadi writes the dark side of the society. His works often depict the cynical side of human nature. And, his prose is usually honest. BUT:Regarding The Salesman:1- There is utterly limited characterization. Farhadi fails to build the main characters. Prior to the incident (first twenty minutes or so), we do not get a sense of who these people indeed are. Thus, after the incident, we cannot connect to the couple, even considering the nature of such an inhumane episode. There is no frame of reference, no baseline. 2- Characters are floppy and sense-less. I know that it would be difficult to 'talk' about such an incident and that's where Farhadi intends to go, BUT who COULD make spaghetti and listen to music 48 hours later? does not make sense. I have not seen more apathetic characters and I certainly do not see the 'destruction' of the family. Where is the inner conflict? show me! A perfect example would be the couple from Rabbit Hole (2010). I live with them. 3- The aforementioned destruction could be 'shown' in the house, instead of the set of The Salesman. Borrowing from Miller's play is futile, in my opinion.3- 'Mannerism' kills the script. Farhadi brutally eradicates the script by cutting the scene, 'make a statement' about the society, and proceeding to next one. These unnecessarily statements do not rise from the characters, but the director. Examples: Classroom or the roof. 4- There is no tension. Farhadi provides little regarding the incident, other than the aftermath of a bloody floor. I understand Farhadi ultimately favors linear narrative. But perhaps for this specific case, a chronological narrative weakens tension. 5- I was hoping to be impressed, at least, by the encounter of Taraneh (Rana) and the old man, but truthfully that is one clumsy barren scene. Everything - all the feelings - should be revealed on the old man's / Rana's look, but we get a disappointing shot and a sense-less ""sorry"". Just compare the look on Mads Mikkelssen in Jagten (2012 - Church scene) or even the looks on Gosling and Stone (La La Land - final scene) and the non-existent one here. Case in point.6- The plot is haphazard with several holes. It's not even remotely Cannes material, let alone winning the prize. I expected more with all the hype around the film, but am left with a confused chaotic film which leads us nowhere. Looking forward to Farhadi's next one."

" A Riveting Piece of Filmmaking
",0.0,0.9978,2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"I am struck at the complexity of this film, and the reflective nature of its narrative structure. Action or events as a device to look at our natures, choices, motives, drives and dreams. And let's not stop there. How about actors acting theater scenes, and throw in a play within a play to boot, for good measure.I know I sound somewhat critical above, and under less skilled hands, such criticism would be warranted. But not here. THE SALESMAN is compelling from beginning to end. And using Arthur Miller's iconic play, THE DEATH OF A SALESMAN, works so well to comment on these character's dreams, failings, nobility and humanity. A dream -- or rather dreams -- shattered by a single, accidental, innocent incident. At the end of the journey, of our own Odyssey, whether we arise as a hero or a victim depends on our choices, our attitudes, our sheer willfulness for goodness or our tendency for self-destruction. To me, this movie raised these issues, and more. I loved it. Compelling through and through, and from a most-gifted, cinematically articulate director.Scoring the different elements of the film objectively, 1 to 4:Script/Story: 4, loved it. And all this set against a backdrop of a crackling, fall building; a house of cards, if you will.Cinematography/Visual Effects: 3.5. Well shot. Close shots heightened the tension.Editing: 3.5. Well edited; kept the pacing of a natural thriller, but lacked the cheesiness of one.Sound Effects: 3, competent sound mixingMusical Score: 3; frankly do not recall any musical score underscoring the film. This is sad as I should have noticed. Was there one?Performances: 4, extremely strong performances. Great ensemble work, and standout work by the two leads, and the old man, too. I was particularly touched by the scene between the two men when the lead told the old man to take off his shoes. This scene was so effectively shot. Slow pacing of the camera capturing every quiver of both performances. Wow.Production Design: Sets, Locations, Costumes, etc.: 2.5; my complaint here deals with the shots from the theater itself where DEATH OF A SALESMAN was being performed. Needed something more here. Would you recommend this movie to a friend? Absolutely; a fine work of cinema. And extremely provocative. Well written; well shot; well delivered. Most highly recommended. Strong Oscar contender for Best Foreign Language Film."

",0.0,0.986,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"After having just moved into their new home Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti), a couple of fellow actors find themselves in a difficult home life situation after a violation of their home. S they go through the performances at the local theater of Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman' their relationship takes a left turn from which it might not ever go back.I tried to keep the synopsis as vague as possible so not to spoil the film, since, as in most of Farhadi's films, the inciting incident comes in later in the film and the drama ultimately does not develop until the third act, something that this director likes to do and at which he excels, always giving priority to the space in which characters develop and live their everyday lives.And those are exactly the reasons why ""The Salesman"" is a fantastically subtle and morally complex revenge tale masked as a home drama, which has some of the best work by actors I have seen in 2016, even though this might be too slightly of a familiar territory from Farhadi.It is no coincidence that Shahab Hosseini won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, if there is one reason why this film succeeds it is him. This performance is raw and authentic in its own unique way, he manages to guide us through every one of the stages of degradation his character goes through and he manages to do so without us noticing. On a surface level the character arch he goes through would be hard to believe, there are some changes that wouldn't appear natural when spelled out. Yet, Hosseini manages to sell us on this person and all of the turbulence he has to go through, he manages to enhance little moments that I can't imagine working on paper. He fits right into the world that Farhadi builds and comes out giving a powerhouse of a performance that guides the audience through the whole narrative.Certainly, Farhadi deserves to share some of the credit for the performance too, for many reasons. Firstly, just as in all of his film, the performances across the board are just flawless, he directs actors to perfection and he doesn't even give you a chance to realize this. The way in which he uniquely manages to capture everyday life is profoundly stunning. From the camera-work to every detail of the blocking of actors right down to every word they say, the fabric of ordinariness he succeeds in putting on screen is flawless. I have no idea if this is all meticulously thought out or if it is left to brilliant improvisation and I don't want to know, what is clear to me is that as a director his methods work excellently and the results he manages to produce on screen are remarkable.Then, when it comes to building the drama, Farhadi is just as masterful. The evolution of it is natural and doesn't ever feel forced upon the characters, the parallels traced with theater might be a little too on the nose, but they are stunningly relevant and used to an incredible cinematic effect. He manages to build and build the drama and make it culminate in a riveting finale where all of the themes and the moral questions the film asks flow out naturally from it and leave you hanging at just the right moment. He also manages to build a complex web of visual cues and use them effectively to complement the characters and the story, once again here the visual parallels with the theater are a joy to see unfold.It has to be said that this is very familiar territory for Farhadi, the contrast of personal justice versus institutionalized justice is very relevant is his past film ""A Separation"" and so is the outlook on revenge, the degrading and the toll it takes on the individual and the destructive results of it. Sometimes it even feels like he is retracing his steps and for someone who has seen his film this might result in a slightly predictable outcome, even though the self contained drama in the film never looses its relevance to the characters, ultimately resulting in a constantly fascinating watch that challenges the viewer and defies traditional cinematic beats and expectations"
" Imagine being a victim. What would you do?
",-0.2732,0.9346,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Asghar Farhadi never disappoints me. Almost all of his works are wonderful and one of the great drama film directors I always look forward to watch his movies. In my opinion, great drama movies are the ones that stick with you. While his Oscar winner film, a Separation, didn't have the same effect on me as much as The Salesman had, I think The Salesman is among his top works if not the best. Putting yourself in the shoes of Rana (the victim of a rape) and Emad (your loved one is the victim) you can imagine yourself having the same reaction after the accident happens to you. The scene on the roof (also exists in the trailer) when Emad comes to look for Rana and Rana seems to be scared a bit even when Emad calls her was among my favorite scenes of the movie. I loved how this movie shows the psychological and emotional effects on the assault victim and how it is even so difficult for Rana to describe the event to police. Definitely looking forward to re-watch it."
