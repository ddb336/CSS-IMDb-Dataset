" Popstar is 4real
",0.0,0.9984,2020-11-03 00:00:00,7,"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is written, directed and starring ""The Lonely Island"" trio, Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer. ""Popstar"" centres around a former boy band member and his struggles after the commercial failure of a record. So just by the way I described that, you're probably thinking, ""Huh... Sounds like a melodramatic film about an egotistical celebrity figuring out his place in the world"" and well guys I have to tell you, ""Popstar"" is one of the funniest satirical films I've seen in years. Initially I was hesitate about this film but also had high hopes due to this being a ""Lonely Island"" film and I've loved their material in the past from SNL, to their music and films, such as ""Hot Rod"". My hesitation stemmed from the lack of jokes hitting in the trailer so it had me pretty nervous but I tried to relax as I realized I am in the hands of 3 gentlemen who can really nail comedy and boy they did in this film. I'll try to describe this film as much as possible without spoiling anything as everything you see in the trailer is practically in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Now what made this film so great was like I said, the satirical play they did on a celebrity's life, it took situations and scandals thats happened to some famous actors, musicians, etc and runs with them trying to make it as wild as possible. One thing that really elevated this movie and I loved, was how authentic this film felt, it practically rips the Justin Bieber documentaries apart, all while including many celebrities talking about Conner4real and how he changed the face of music. You really buy into this film due to that and how serious each celebrity cameo plays their part, that it makes you feel like you're actually watching a real life documentary on a living and breathing artist. Like I said this film contains many celebrity cameos, so many that I won't even name because I feel like I would be ruining it. Now this movie isn't all good, as with most comedy, some jokes didn't land but luckily when a joke fell flat they didn't stick around too long as this is a very fast paced film clocking in at an 87 minute long run time, also when the jokes hit they sure do hit with side splitting laughter. Another problem is its story, when you get past the cleverness of the joke writing, the core of this story is very cookie cutter and a little too basic, but then again this is a comedy and I shouldn't be expecting anything revolutionary from its story, all I care about is if it can make me laugh. This is definitely a social commentary on the way we view and treat celebrates today, heck this universe even has its own version of ""TMZ"" which is hysterical. There is so much social commentary that by the end, you kind of sit back and reflect, so I really have to commend this film for being deeper than it needed to be. At the end of the day this really was just another goofy comedy but what it did with its creative writing and satire, it made it better than it ever needed to be and for that reason, ""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" gets an 7/10."

" Awful music genre to me so not a movie I enjoyed.
",-0.7154,0.7519,2020-09-02 00:00:00,5,"Although I like almost every comedian in this movie and also a couple of the ""real"" music stars that are featuring in Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping I'm disappointed. I thought it would be better to be honest, but the music is so bad it's cringing to listen to. I know it's supposed to be funny, and there are a couple of funny scenes, but the choice of music is really painful to listen to. I guess this movie must have cost a lot when you see all those ""stars"" featuring but that doesn't mean quality. The story is boring, and the fact I love Andy Samberg normally, certainly as Peralta in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, doesn't change anything to me. He's always funny in what he does, but in this case the music didn't help. Maybe I would have liked it more if it was another genre of music, but this kind of music is the one I hate in real life so watching a long movie about it didn't help."
" Comedy Gold. The Spinal Tap of a new generation.
",0.3612,0.99,2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Satire can be tough to pull off. That said, Samberg has done it with this film. I can only imagine when they were writing this screenplay. They must have been rolling on the floor. It's a glimpse into the life and personal tribulations of a vapid popstar with marginal ability, major ego, propped up by his associations and past success.In spite of being insanely funny, from Conner's blissful ignorance, to his absurd lyrics, this film does have heart. Conner's journey is interesting and endearing. Though he is vapid and ignorant of reality, the truth sets in and hits him hard. There's only one thing worth making a film about: The human heart in conflict with itself. Popstar does that.Fair warning: The film cab be crude, but that is part of the period's humor. There's nothing too offensive for most adults, perhaps not for kids under 12 or 13 (though kids these days know more than we tend to give them credit for). All in all it's done with as much class as possible.Highly recommend checking this out. The cameos are great, and it does a great job following Conner's journey. The music is pretty solid, as well. This is the Spinal Tap of a new generation. Brilliant."

The music in the film is quite funny as well. It was very heartwarming when the boy band got reunited in the end.I would recommend this film to anyone interested in a good comedy."
" A bit formulaic, and miss-marketed, but fun
",0.6652,0.9963,2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"Popstar may be a bit overstuffed at times, but it is able to remain consistently entertaining throughout and at times quite funny. Andy Samberg leads a brilliantly over-the-top performance as Conner-4-real and truly carries the film on its comedic level. Tim Meadows and Sarah Silverman also provide some great supporting performances, as well as Joan Cusack as Conner's mom. The film can be a bit formulaic at times, as previous tropes are poked fun at, as they have been before, and at times the film can seem to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for some original moments (besides the songs). The film can be quite funny at times, with some lovely and clever satire, as well as some truly stupid, but fun moments and hilarious cameos. In the end, Popstar is not a total success, but it is able to carry itself more often than not, and prove to be a showcase of talent from all involved- especially The Lonely Island themselves.
My Rating: 8/10"

",0.4927,0.9848,2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is an incredibly funny mockumentary that's gleefully over the top. Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone are all perfect and extremely funny. Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows and Chris Redd are all great. It's extremely well paced. Akiva Schaffer's and Jorma Taccone's direction is great and it's well filmed. The songs are amazing, both catchy and hilarious."
" a-ok for a light genre comedy
",0.3612,0.9883,2020-04-18 00:00:00,7,"Andy Samberg owns the spotlight, playing a Bieber-esque swooner who abandoned his old bandmates, springboarding their early group fame into solo superstardom. Samberg is right on the money as the essentially deluded wunderkind, set adrift without a life jacket when his sophomore album is met with universal disdain. His elaborate stage performances are a big highlight, spinning the band's notoriously loony lyrics (the ""Bin Laden Song"" production must be seen) into a heavily-funded, bombastic concert experience that's pitch-perfect. Lampooning the inherent idolatry of pop music is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's intrinsically shallow fun, but the laughs are pretty consistent. I didn't sense very much bite in the original music - most of the lyrics are scattershot and random, which is mildly disappointing - but the beats are still great and there's a hidden gem or two in the deep cuts. ""Legalize It,"" which plays over the closing credits, was my favorite of the bunch, as berserk and ridiculous as TLI's best. Stuffed with celebrity cameos to lend credence and unpredictability, not to mention effortlessly hilarious, it won't surprise you or strum your heartstrings. Which is a-ok for a light genre comedy. I could do with more like this, actually."

" Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016)
",0.143,0.7307,2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Directed by Akiva Schaffer & Jorma Taccone. Starring Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Tim Meadows, Sarah Silverman, Chris Redd, Imogen Poots, Maya Rudolph, Joan Cusack. (R)The ""This Is Spinal Tap"" rock mockumentary style is updated to the modern age when dance pop and hip-hop dominate the charts; Samberg plays Connor4Real, an industry superstar dealing with the fallout of the release of his heavily-hyped album to dismal reviews and sales. Raucous, fast-paced comedy throws everything it can at the dartboard and sees what sticks, be it incisive satire, sly insider jabs, deadpan one-liners, knowingly dumb gags, or gross-out vulgarity. As a result, sloppy at times and uneven overall, but it's admirably relentless and generates more than enough laughs (even the shameful kind) to ultimately succeed in style. Serving as actors, producers, writers and directors, it's Samberg, Taccone and Schaffer's show--they of Lonely Island fame--but they share the wealth with their co-stars, including a galaxy of celebrity cameos from both the film and music industries, often playing themselves. As it is with Lonely Island, the songs are often ridiculous but still catchy enough to get stuck in the head (notably ""Finest Girl (Bin Laden Song)"").72/100"

The film is really well done, the sets and crowds are great really setting the tone as a concert movie. I liked the characters and the back and forth energy between Samberg and Taccone. Honestly after the Jizz in my Pants vid they deserve to make this in my opinion. Im not a fan of the repetitiveness of this project though, I lost interest a little more than halfway through due to it being monotonous."

Well I giggled (not laughed) maybe two or three times in the entire movie... so I'd say it pretty much failed as a comedy movie. Nothing against Lonely Island and their novelty music, but it simply didn't make me laugh, and thus failed for what it set out to do/be."
" A Smart Mocumentary.
",0.4019,0.9653,2019-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Review:
'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' is an American mockumentary-comedy film directed by Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. I can't even count how many times I have watched this movie and it never gets old. I watch it for reasons any normal person would watch a movie, entertainment alone. However, I watched it more closely this time around because I wanted to give an impartial review, based on the movie's criteria and not what my own personal sense of humor is.
The film follows a solo music artist by the name of Conner4Real (Andy Samberg) as he falls from fame and reconnects with his childhood friends.
This movie was so smart taking the documentary route, because the three guys from ""The Lonely Island"" are not the best actors in the world. Taking this approach, they didn't need to be - it felt like a crew was just following these people around and weird shit was happening. They have so many cameos in this movie too. I'm not going to say who because some of the people they got is so surprising, again almost all the cameos are playing themselves and can't really act, so this format works on all aspects.
Everything in this movie is to the moon and it's fantastic. The soundtrack is incredible and funny. They got so many guest artists to feature in this soundtrack, such as Akon, P!nk, Emma Stone and Linkin' Park to name a few! It's something that is going to be offensive to some, if you take it the wrong way. You really need to go into this knowing who ""The Lonely Island"" are and what type of comedy they possess versus what their views are in real life. They look at comedy as making fun of political views, so when we watch the music video for ""Equal Rights"" and Conner is being very offensive in the video starting throughout that he is ""not gay"", it's Andy Samberg making fun of 'Toxic Masculinity'.
Overall, if you're a fan of ""The Lonely Island"" you should check this one out, because they all wear their hearts on their sleeves in this movie and you can tell they cared about that outcome. You might not be able to see where I am coming from because this is such a raunchy and eccentric film. That just means you don't know Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer's comedy and might just want to stay away from one.

" Should be sent to a lonely island and bombed
",-0.3612,0.0217,2019-06-18 00:00:00,2,"I had frankly high expectations when going in to this, all of which were brutally shattered by 30 minutes as I suddenly realised its everything I hate about film. I generally speaking don't mesh well with American Comedy avoiding most films and finding the likes of 'Friends' barely tolerable there's been some sort of appeal to Samberg as both character and actor for a while from me and his work on a Brooklyn Nine-Nine is impressive but here his form was all off. I've got a good knowledge of the lonely island and find their work fun but something does not hit well at all here. Connor the lead of the 'documentary' is intolerable and for as much as this was intended tonal there's genuinely no charm in the character whatsoever. The others have roles that weren't worth naming and frankly are interchanged as the plot decides. The form aspect is poor, a 'mockumentary' there's so much potential when approaching such a type of film see the lines of 'What we Do in the Shadows' with the genre classic being 'Spinal Tap' there's evidence of what can be achieved in this world but all is missed here. In the case of 'Popstar' which it'll be called for convenience sake there's more focus on just celebrity cameos opposed to substance with all the Talking Heads being a who's who? Of modern fame featuring but not limited too: A$AP Rocky, Usher, Akon and later stock footage of the likes of Rita Ora and one more major appearance from Snoop Dogg. This absolute scatter of fame is presumably there for drinking game purposes and serves no real weight to the characters at all with only Justin Timberlake and Usher actually appearing outside of the Talking Heads segments. The 'Style Boyz' funnily enough appear to have no chemistry what so ever and such the payoff of the grand return misses the mark completely and the music is enough to make ears bleed, which sure is again intentional but even so just stop and also in hindsight how they got away with certain songs is amazing as they certainly didn't sit well with me personally. The splitting of the characters was contrived and the return was also plus the 'comedy' in between was worthless and had zero laughs from me. In what seems to be just a million cameos and various cultural references (Such as Kanye West attacking a videoing journalist) it's more of a 'look it's Celebrity X' and 'oh I remember that' opposed to anything that has real substance as a film and such is just a waste of time that passed by so painfully slow, if you can avoid it."

" For real
",0.0,0.8943,2019-06-05 00:00:00,7,"After Hot Rod, The Lonely Island team of Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone tackled the world of pop music yet bombed bigger than the movie's hero, Conner4Real making only $9 million back from a $20 million dollar budget.I have no idea why. This is the kind of movie that rewards multiple viewings, sticking to the maxim that makes so many 80's comedies work. Come up with a simple plot and let hijinks ensue.Once, Conner4Real (Samberg) was in The Style Boyz with his childhood friends Lawrence and Owen (Schaffer and Taccone), but his success made him a spinoff act. Now, Owen is his DJ, forced to wear a giant head that plays the sound from the Tom Cruise era War of the Worlds, while Lawrence hides at his farm.The joy of this film is how it juxtaposes real life artists - Mariah Carey, the Rza, even Arcade Fire - with the unreal world that Conner lives in. He employs thirty people, including a man who punches him in the privates so that he remembers where he came from.But the second album just can't live up to his debut - Thriller, Also - even when his sponsor, Aquaspin, plays them in all of their appliances. Soon, his tour is joined by a new opening act - Saturday Night Live's Chris Redd as Hunter the Hungry - and their friendship quickly sours.There's a really deep joke in the midst of all this silliness. After saving Conner and his fiancee from wolves - don't ask - the singer Seal claims that wolves caused his scars. In real life, they came from lupus, but seeing as how the scientific name for wolves is canis lupus, that's a pretty far way to go for a throwaway laugh.If you don't like movies that get completely stupid, there's nothing I can do to convince you to watch this. But for those that just like being entertained, this one does it every time."

" Satire, comedy, and an entertaining parody of the music industry!
",0.69,0.9821,2018-08-14 00:00:00,8,"The minds behind the Lonely Island take a stab at the rock-mockumentary format with comedic intentions and they stab in the right place!The performances are great comedy. Andy Samberg shines in the main role. His buds from the Lonely Island do quite decently. Akiva Schaffer is especially funny. Tim Meadows and Sarah Silverman are funny, no surprise, and this film acts as a sort of intro for Chris Redd, whose performance is on point. The cameos by comedians and musicians are great.The writing crafts a pretty basic story about friendship but uniquely funny scenarios and witty, quick dialogue make it a good screenplay.The direction leaves a bit to be desired, but sometimes there isn't much to do in a mockumentary. That being said, there are quite a few bits at the end that show Kiv and Jorma's hidden talent.The soundtrack is the final star. It's exactly what it's supposed to be, stereotypical hip-hop mixed with comedy. And some color.Disclaimer: don't watch this with your kids.Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016) is satirical and comedic, while serving as an entertaining parody/commentary on the music industry. 8/10"

Looking for a Comedy flick to buy that we could watch together,I went for Girls Trip-which ended up not turning up in time. Going to Birmingham day before the meet-up,I decided look in HMV for an alt choice. Not having a movie in mind,I looked at the shelves,and found a film I had ordered months ago on Ebay that had got lost in the post! This led to me finally becoming a popstar...View on the film:
Blending all the major trends in the current music scenes, the screenplay by co-writers/(with Jorma Taccone)co-stars/co-directors Akiva Schaffer & Andy Samberg play a pitch-perfect parody of the times,from the hilariously vicious riffs on social media memes and gossip shows like TMZ, (here called CMZ) to the ""bad boy"" image Pop stars use to make themselves look edgy,and the deafening beats of EDM. Giving Conner chart-topping tunes,the writers spin super-catchy spoof tracks, ranging from pounding Hip-Hop,to very funny, R&B/Pop tracks on subjects that include Osama Bin Laden. Stealing all of Conner's Pop fame, Chris Redd gives a fantastic performance as rapper Hunter,with Redd giving his stage performances a rough, exciting atmosphere. Looking every inch the modern chart-topper, Andy Samberg gives a great performance as Conner,whose arrogance Samberg uses to keep him completely lacking in self-awareness as all those who worked with him quitting,over Conner believing he is a Popstar who will never stop stopping."

",0.143,0.9817,2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"This was always going to be divisive. A satirical look through the pop star telescope, where we have a fictional story filmed in the style of a documentary. Whether you view it as just a film or a slight dig at pop stars and bands like Justin Bieber or One Direction, it's undeniably entertaining. However, it's just that. It never really dives from the glossy surface to the depths of intelligence. A band entitled ""Style Boyz"" started off with a successful career, until the lead singer is thrown into the limelight and commences a solo career. We follow him on his new album release and tour and get an insight to the lavish lifestyle and pressure of a pop star. The key ingredient to this film is the inclusion of comedic band 'The Lonely Island'. Love them, hate them, don't care about them...but you cannot deny that their hilarious song writing is crazily infectious. I mean, I remember when they created a song called ""Jack Sparrow"" with Michael Bolton (who I'm glad is in this as well), and I still sing it to this day. In fact, I'm going to put it on right now. We've got songs about equal rights, terrorism and a great closing track. Clearly assimilating the current craze of having politically themed songs that aren't necessarily explicit. Throughly enjoyed the songs though. ""Keira Knightleyyy""! Performances were fine, with real cameos of musicians and media moguls embedded in the documentarian narrative. That's all well and good, the problem is...I didn't laugh. I smiled at a scene involving a swarm of bees, that's about it. For something that is supposed to be ""insanely funny"", I was rather underwhelmed. Clever but not hilarious. I also found the main plot to be ludicrously formulaic, which is a shame for a rather fresh idea. As soon as the pace kicked in, the film ended. Over far too soon. I can categorically say this was underwhelming, considering the mass adoration for this. However, it is enjoyable and would watch it again. Next time, have more Michael Bolton, he wins at life."

Rather than string a few of their film clips with a tenuous plot, they've created an original movie, with original songs.Gleefully aping Justin Bieber's ""Never Say Never"", Samberg plays pop-rapper Conner4Real, a former member of boy band The Style Boyz with childhood friends Owen (Taccone) and Lawrence (Schaffer). Conner4Real become a solo superstar and a tabloid darling, his excessive ego and bravado makes Oasis in the nineties look restrained. The film charts the release of Conner's second album Connquest, some questionable appliance-based marketing choices, his friendship-turned rivalry with rapper Hunter the Hungry (Chris Redd) and eventual fall from superstardom. As well as SNL alumni Sarah Silverman, Tim Meadows, Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph, ""Popstar"" has an impressive list of guest stars, most who've collaborated with Lonely Island, including:Akon, ASAP Rocky, Michael Bolton, Mariah Carey, RÃ©gine Chassagne, Simon Cowell, Danger Mouse, DJ Khaled, Jimmy Fallon, 50 Cent, Adam Levine, Nas, Pink, Questlove, The Roots, RZA, Seal, Martin Sheen, Snoop Dogg, Ringo Starr, T.I., Carrie Underwood, Usher and Pharrell Williams. The best cameo is from the always-game Justin Timberlake, playing Connor4Real's put upon tour chef.Samberg - of course - dominates this movie, with Taccone and Schaffer pulling double duty as directors and playing Conner's bandmates.""Popstar"" deserves its MA rating, with a number of delightfully filthy songs, including ""Finest Girl"", which uses Osama Bin Laden's death as a sexual metaphor. The soundtrack is a must buy/download for Lonely Island fans.As a mockumentary, ""Popstar"" won't have the wide appeal - or legacy - of Spinal Tap, but it's still a heap of fun, especially if you love Lonely Island's music."

Stupid, vulgar, unoriginal, incredibly immature (oh how we instill terrible values in our youth!), lowly, mean spirited, and rarely, if ever funny. Even the content that garnered a reaction from me seemed to do so unintentionally. The copious amounts of positive reviews on here make me wonder if IMDb manifests its own conspiracy...Underlying the ""comedic"" subsistence of the film is a message: the pop music industry is built upon formula, not talent, not originality, NOT the genuine desire to guide the people's consciousness-- or moral compass-- toward higher mentalities. Unfortunately, ""The Lonely Boys"" follows the same formula, in effect overshadowing some enlightened realizations with yet more unenlightened ones.No good. Don't believe the positive reviews unless you're an impressionable, susceptible 12 year-old. In which case, don't watch the movie at all!"

It mocks real life events in the music industry, pop culture, celebrity culture, the news and so much more. It's perfect. Just like Naked Gun, Airplane, and Scary Movie, Pop Star is the perfect mix of satire, realism and just flat out comedy. Of course it's dumb. So are humans and the real world we exist in. That's why it works so well. The best (my favorite) stand-up comics are always the ones commenting on the real world and how they fit into it. Andy Samberg knows how to create a character that seems completely absurd, but in reality, isn't that far off from reality at all.

This film shows a very realistic view point of how artists go through fame and shows the ups and downs of the music industry. The budget as relatively low but they made the film very much watchable and unique with all the cameos and extra stunts. One can tell they did their research and Adam Sanberg put a lot of effort into the making of the film. Having doubts of how exactly the film would, Never Stop Popping exceeded my expectations and was a lot better than expected. The film is quite short which works well in its favor as it does not overstay its welcome (meaning it doesn't drag on). The parodying of TMZ was another unique and funny aspect of the film. This film flopped which is a shame but nonetheless not surprising. Recommended for those who enjoy Lonely Island or are seeking a concert type comedy. As a rewatch 08/05/18' Popstar feels better and moves more smoothly on a second watch. Highly recommend as this film is quite overlooked but then again is for an acquired taste in comedy and music of sorts. Enjoy and don't take the film too serious."

The soundtrack along with the movie was very hilarious as the themes were very creative and sounded like it was come up on the spot.

But the movie always feels rather slight. Samberg's character has little depth, so his fall from grace feels less like the tragedy of hubris and more like a jerk getting his comeuppance, which means you never really care about the story. It's a very jokey, superficial film, so when it's funny you enjoy it but every time the humor weakens you think, why was I watching this again.While not as funny as Samberg's series, Brooklyn Nine-nine, it's definitely fun."

Think of Robbie Williams going solo or something like that but without heavy drugs or drinking. Mine favourite is from Mariah Carrey, who probably _is_ the most humble person she knows : ) The plot is quite predictable from the start, there were some nice twists though. The most of the songs are really politically incorrect, (even reminded a bit of Borat franchise). The last song is actually a hoot, no pun intended : ) ..Final thought: If you into this kind of films the documentary about Heath Ledger if definitely worth watching."

When it comes to Andy Samberg I find his music very funny, but his comedy styling and acting are not so much to my taste. So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself having a very good time with this film. Right from the start it was genuinely funny and the music was catchy and hilarious in only the style that 'The Lonely Island' can achieve.There are an enormous amount of celebrity cameos, all of which are cleverly done and seem like the person really bought into it. The story, while a playoff of Justin Bieber obviously, is actually really investing and well structured.When it comes to comedy I find it's almost always a case of simply asking yourself, how funny was it? In the case of 'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping' though it feels like there were more layers to it than that. You can appreciate the music, the story and the send up of Bieber. I don't think this did overly well at the box office (was it marketed very well? I never heard about it until well after it was released) which is a shame. I would recommend giving this one a look."
" It's Good for a Few Laughs but POPSTAR Hasn't Got a Lot of Substance
",0.4678,0.9975,2017-09-11 00:00:00,7,"It was only a matter of time before the Lonely Island guys came out with a music mockumentary; I just expected it to be about Lonely Island. Nope. Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer instead bring us into the world of fictional international pop icon Conner4real (Samberg). The movie is constructed as a behind-the-scenes/concert film for Conner as he prepares to release the follow-up album to his massive hit solo debut. Conner was originally a member of boy band/hip-hop trio the Style Boyz but broke off on his own when his ego became too much to handle for the trio's writer, Lawrence (Schaffer). Now Conner tours the world with the band's third member, Owen (Taccone), as his DJ while Lawrence has retired to a quiet life of farming and subpar wood carving. Conner's second album debuts with such controversial hits as ""Equal Rights"" and ""Bin Laden"" and becomes an instant flop. Unable to cope with failure and surrounded by useless sycophants, Conner life begins a downward spiral and Owen believes a Style Boyz reunion would be the best thing for everyone. Unfortunately, Conner and Lawrence didn't exactly part on the best of terms and getting the two of them in a room to talk, much less reunite for a performance, is going to be near impossible. POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING is an improv- laden mockumentary in the same vein of THIS IS SPINAL TAP but never achieves its level of awesomeness, but it has got its share of laughs.I enjoyed POPSTAR for what it is but watching it has made me realize how much I miss normal scripted comedies. Improv films can be real hit-or-miss and this one is no different, but I'd say the scales tip in favor of the funnier bits. There aren't a whole lot of hilarious moments that'll be with you too long after the movie is over, but you're bound to get some chuckles from it if this is your type of comedy. Personally, my favorite gag comes about halfway through the movie when Conner's manager Harry (Tim Meadows, excellent as usual) is breaking some bad news to the singer over some breakfast mimosas and Conner has a rough moment, asking the documentarians to kill the cameras for a minute. The video cuts out but we keep the audio as their tender conversation quickly turns when a wandering bee becomes a nuisance and quickly escalates to a battle of life and death. That was probably the one time the movie got a solid laugh from me. The rest is a bit of a mixed bag but fans of Samberg and the Lonely Island material from ""Saturday Night Live"" shouldn't be disappointed. There are plenty of new songs created for the movie and Conner4real and some of them are pretty good, but there's nothing on the level of ""J*zz in My Pants"", ""I'm on a Boat"", or ""Motherlover"". This is why I was hoping it'd be a mockumentary about Lonely Island: great music catalog.Since it's a ""documentary"", it's filled with cameos from music artists who've got a sense of humor and contributed interview snippets including RZA, Mariah Carey, and Ringo Starr. You can also expect the usual cavalcade of comedic talent filling out the rest of the case, such as the aforementioned Tim Meadows as Conner's manager and Sarah Silverman as his press agent. There is plenty of talent on display here; Samberg and company pulled out all the stops to surround him with high quality cast-mates. So even if the comedy isn't your style, you can spend the duration of the movie tracking the endless stream of cameos. Otherwise, it's exactly what you would expect for a Lonely Island mockumentary. If that's your thing, you'll probably find a reason to watch and I'm sure you'll enjoy it fine. If not, this movie isn't likely going to win you over. POPSTAR is what it is and to me it's a fun piece of throwaway entertainment that might've aspired to SPINAL TAP levels and fell short. The Apatow style of improv that's permeated comedies in the last ten years is good for a quick laugh but most of the movies of this sort are quickly forgotten and I'm sure POPSTAR, as amusing as it can be, will probably fall into that category."

It is a laugh riot from start to finish as we follow Connor separating from his group Style Boyz, trying to make it as a solo artist. What follows is a consistently funny, always energetic and never tedious ninety minutes that is a pure delight. There are many great songs featured throughout, which we have come to expect from the group, they really went above and beyond for this project. I was a little underwhelmed, I was very excited for this film, and was hoping it would be a nine for pure comedy gold, but it ended up being an eight for me. I really just felt that the plot could have gone further, I would like to have seen Connor in more ludicrous situations before making peace with his best friends. I felt the screenplay really had the potential to go anywhere, but it played a little safe. The cast is phenomenal. Of course, Andy Samberg is stellar as Connor 4Real, a snobby, arrogant, lovable artist that the versatile comedian nails. As well as that, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Sarah Silverman and Tim Meadows shine in main roles, while there are also a ton of priceless cameos throughout that I will not spoil, but each one is well casted and simply hilarious. Ridiculous fun from beginning to end. Stellar cast, comedically brilliant and boasting some excellent original songs, I would highly recommend Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping to anyone looking for a good comedy.

It is not that Christopher Guest is too subtle or Weird Al is too old-fashioned; but with declining attention spans and deluge of digital entertainment options... they are. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is able to capture and imbue the same deadpan satire with in- your-face subtlety. The best satires are a reflection of the current state of culture, music, technology, fandom, and yes vulgarities of society. So while some may dismiss ""Popstar"" as another 90 minute crude-as-craft Apatow vehicle, peppered with cameos to re-grab the attention of the AD/HD crowd, it is much more than that. In 2005, The Lonely Island viral video ""Lazy Sunday"" was the tipping point for the now ubiquitous You-Tube, and is credited by some for its subsequent $1.5 billion valuation and acquisition by Google. The ensuing battles over copyright take-downs, creation of Hulu, and IP ownership was not lost on it's members. The immediacy and vulgarity of Samberg/Apatow's trademark humor are layered over the archetypical music parody plot, which is simple, superficial hilarity.But for those looking closely are themes of privacy vs. social media, corporate overreach, obsession with celebrity news, the absurdity of today's ""music""... all with back-handed whimsy. Managing to mock their own audience without them even realizing they are also being critiqued. While Samberg is the lead, the other members co-star and direct, with all three credited as the writers. The Lonely Island boys know how to goose the Millennial audience to remain relevant, while servicing their own influences (namely Christopher Guest and Weird Al Yankovic). And therein lies the real fun of this film. You can choose which level you want to enjoy it on. Deadpan satire? Sure. Social commentary? Definitely. Mindless fun with crude humor, poking fun at pampered, self-important pop-stars (possibly from Canada)? Absolutely. Oh, and it also reminds you that friends are good. So there's that.

Just like Ricky Bobby, Conner (Andy Samberg) goes from the top of the game to total loser very quickly...and only by learning humility and appreciating his friends can he once again be on top. And, like ""Walk Hard"", it's a mockumentary about the music industry...and it's very crude at times and has some genitalia. It is NOT a film for kids, that's for sure!

The film provides an accurate portrayal of the music business and its insane ways. The fact that the producers managed to convince a bunch of superstars to make cameo appearances, where they pretty much made fun of themselves, says a lot about this industry.But lets not get too philosophical.

" A Solid Coming-of-Age Story Disguised as a Satire
",-0.128,0.9959,2017-04-13 00:00:00,7,"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a parody of the modern music industry, and it follows a young pop star, Conner4Real, as he reaches fame and suddenly begins to plummet. For starters, Andy Samberg is really good as Conner4Real. He captures the self-centered obliviousness of the character without making him feel too fake or over-the-top. He's a super fun character, and it's clear that Samberg is enjoying him too. Jorma Taccone stands out as a particularly good performance as well, as the sidekick friend character who kind of awkwardly lives in the background. The comedic aspect is great. The main source of this is in the songs that Conner4Real performs. They're all great. They sound generic, but the lyrics both fit the character who wrote them and prove to be hilariously offensive. And even the comedy outside of that is great. Again, Samberg really has a good time with this one, and the writing for him proves to be just the same. And yet, despite the comedic and satirical aspect of the film, it is still at least partially a coming-of-age story. Samberg's character really isn't that unbelievable, and when he starts to fall it takes on a more serious tone. It's not a weird sudden tonal change because the movie is both serious and comedic all the way through, it just gets more serious towards the end. In some ways it is kind of generic as far as coming-of-age stories go, but the characters are solid enough to carry it, so it wasn't a problem. Overall I really enjoyed Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. It's a solid comedy and an equally good coming-of-age story. In the end I would definitely recommend this one."
" A brilliant satire - this generations This Is Spinal Tap
",0.5859,0.9974,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"In 2007 a small-scale comedy with little hype and eventual disappointing box office returns and reviews appeared on our cinema screens, that film was Hot Rod.Featuring the trio of comedians that would eventually become a popular singing group known as Lonely Island, Hot Rod introduced Andy Samberg, Jorma Tacone and Akiva Schaffer to the world and while initially it seemed like the gangs feature film foray may've been a mistake, in the years to come Hot Rod has become one of the great cult films of recent memory and a beloved comedy staple that continues to be enjoyed today.On the back of Hot Rod's eventual success and the heights they've reached with Lonely Island, it's a shame that many cinema-goers failed to jump on board with Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping as what we have here is a mockumentary look at modern day music and fame that could very well be our modern day take of This is Spinal Tap.It's a big call, and one that is perhaps overly optimistic but Popstar with its clever mix of industry lampooning, cast of colourful characters, downright hilarious faux songs and high percentage of joke success (even though the often immature and low common denominator humour will absolutely not be for everyone) certainly stands as one of recent memories best mainstream comedy films and a further win for the Lonely Island collective.Recruiting a star studded ensemble that features cameos from a huge collection of stars both from the movie industry and music scene, led by Samberg as the self-absorbed Connor, the film offers the trope a great playground to deliver their large swag of jokes that are on consideration a lot deeper than you'd gather at first glance and with a near endless stream of content coming at the viewer, as was the case with Hot Rod and key to its lasting success, Popstar is a comedy that will likely continue to find wins on repeat viewings thanks to the various hidden jokes and references that may take keen eyed viewers a while to fully discover.In a genre that has largely been floundering of recent years, Popstar against all the odds stands as an against all the odds shining robot headed beacon of the mainstream Hollywood comedy factory and a likely new favourite to many that will discover the film on home formats, just as Hot Rod did when Rod Kimble found his audience at home after an initial lacklustre reception.4 sick turtles out of 5"
" This is a funny comedy, that stays away from low hanging fruit
",0.5106,0.9774,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"This movie never elevates beyond comedy (and slight satire), but it's really good at what it is. It's a funny movie. It's just a well crafted comedy.While the characters are all caricatured, they're still rooted in some sort of reality. They're dumb, but they're not Zoolander-dumb, they're not like characters from a kids movie. The conflict is actually quite believable, and it's never taken too far. The same goes for the reconciliation. It's easy to believe in. The most silly part of the movie is probably the songs, but they mostly work within the universe that's established.What I like the most, though, is how this movie tries to deliver solid jokes that stands on their own legs. It doesn't succumb to non-sequitors, sudden nostalgic references or slapstic. All of these forms of comedy has their use and place, but they're often overused, and a method of getting cheap laughs. This movie stays clear of those, making it all the better.The fun had by the people making this movie is also obvious, and you can't help but share the joy of it all. The cameos are fun, and well done."
" Exactly what you imagined when you picture a feature-length SNL Digital Short
",0.0,0.7534,2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"I love ""The Lonely Island"". I am a huge fan of their music and I think they brought something fresh and original to the stale format of SNL. I highly enjoy the antics of Andy Samberg no matter in what format, and I think that a lot of the time their humor is intelligent, satirical and highly tongue-in-cheek.But, as in the case of some of their shorts, songs and highly reminiscent of a Seth Macfarlane sketch, whenever there is spare time in the script they overuse their jokes and run them way too long.Now imagine a Digital Short at feature-length. For every genius moment that was thoroughly enjoyable (the amazing last number ft. Bolton and Usher and the singing fish, the Mona Lisa and Ben-Ladin songs, the wedding scene...so much when you break it down) there were another two that were all fizzle. I wish there was a minimalist editor's cut of this film where an outside editor would be able to trim all the fat and leave us with the good solid meaty substance that is definitely present... But seeing as there is no such thing, I cannot help but render Pop-Star a one-time watch with re-watches of clips on Youtube. Sad."
" Works okay as a parody
",0.2263,0.9962,2017-02-15 00:00:00,6,"""Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping"" is an American movie from last year in the English language. At slightly over 80 minutes, it is a relatively short film and it was made by Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. These three also play core characters in here, especially Golden Globe winner Samberg. It is a mix of comedy and music, but really mostly comedy as it makes me a bit sad that what we hear in here is considered music. At least it is just a spoof of what people consider pop music in the 21st century, which is equally depressing though. Anyway, this is the story of an ambitious singer who splits up with his band and tries to become famous on his own, so basically something that happened many times, but rarely worked out as well as it did for Justin Timberlake and BeyoncÃ© for example. The former also has a brief cameo in here like many many others as well, people from the music industry like Usher, Ringo Starr or Mariah Carey who basically play themselves in here.I think this SNL trio came up overall with an entertaining film here. The title already gives away that this is basically spoofing the careers of ""real"" musicians in the pop music industry these days and from this perspective, the outcome is acceptable. However, the consequence is as well that Samberg (and the rest) can go outrageously over the top and justify it all by being satire. I am not sure how much I like the idea, but it is certainly a smart one as this way they made sure we do not recognize Samberg's mediocre (actually almost non-existing) talent when it comes to serious acting. The film lives through funny scenes and comments and really all the spoof elements. Actress Imogen Poots has one of the best lines in her very brief appearance here. So yeah, expect smart writing, but not really good acting here. Poots is one of very few occasions of actually pretty talented performers. All in all, it's an okay little movie, but nothing really that should be on anybody's top of the year list. Thumbs up."
" It's alright
",0.25,0.9695,2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"It's an okay film Andy Samberg and the rest of the Lonely Island are just so dam charming that this film was always going to have some semblance of quality. The sheer number of celebrity appearances is a testament to how well regarded the band is.There are a lot of points in the film where I feel they really rushed the jokes as the majority of them hit the mark, I feel they where trying to replicate Hot Rod in the sense that the film was cheap therefore the low brow jokes weren't out of place however with the amount of money that went into Pop star you kind of feel they could have written better. Plus the mockumentary style wasn't a good choice.My favorite cameo is Justin Timberlake, whenever I see him act it is always well aware of his roots as a musician and he perfectly sells every scene he is in.Watch with friends as you will have fun riffing of one another and enjoy the silly songs."
" Cameos, Cameos, Cameos!
",0.0,0.9659,2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"I truly was expecting more out of this movie. Based on Andy Samberg's strong recent outputs in Brooklyn 99 his performance was a little light in this film. Although packed with cameos, it was a derivative and scripted. I do admit certain parts had me chuckling. The song parodies are still strong and a highlight of the movie, but the plot was easily discernible. I realize that heavy plot twists were not expected in an offering of this type, but a good story is still a good story and it lacked in this aspect. Any Lonely Island fans might enjoy the music and a few light guffaws. I still prefer Samberg in ""Hot Rod"" over this film."
" Learn to ride the wave...
",0.0,0.9903,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Loneley Island-Fans will love this film, because it has all the things you would expect from these guys, dumb-fun.The clue of this film is that it's made like a documentary about the highs and lows of a popstars career. The jokes they play with work very well and are mostly funny. There are interviews with real stars who play themselves for example and act like they know the protagonist for real.Then their are the typical out-of-nowhere-jokes which are obviously the best. One of the most hilarious scenes in the film plays with the fact that the camera doesn't record at the moment, and we only hear what 's going on, i don't wanna spoil this gem, it's great.The acting is very good, mostly because nothing's supposed to be taken seriously. Our three leads are great as always, and you can feel their connection with each other.The story itself isn't that big of a deal, it's as typical as it get 's, with all the clichÃ©s you would expect from this concept, which works sometimes in favour of great jokes, but seems tired and drawn out other times.The music is also catchy and funny as you might expect from these guys, but not incredible compared to other music comedies like ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny"", or ""The Blues Brothers"" for example.It's overall not as good as both of these films, but enjoyable to watch and never fails to entertain..."
