Loved the characters, Peter Dinklage's acting was terrific, and the whole scenario was hilarious. Don't understand the negative ratings AT ALL."

",0.0,0.9184,2020-03-31 00:00:00,4,"For the people: It is all about Melissa McCarthy, all the other characters seems to be just supporting her. Strong swearing, loved it. Good ways to dis haters. It would been better if there were more jokes. : By the people."
" Funny
",0.4404,0.6361,2020-02-02 00:00:00,6,The story is very easy to digest. Melissa McCarthy plays a businesswoman (Michelle) that was put in jail for crimes. Michelle gets back up and is able to lead a group of children to sell brownies together with her former assistant. Dealing with some personal issues she decides to sell their products to a rival/lover Ronald. Eventually they start to duel for the company with 'katana's'.
" Very funny
",0.4927,0.8771,2019-11-20 00:00:00,7,This movie is very funny. Love Melissa Mccarthy. She can play almost any role and she can dance.
" A mess of a film built around an unlikable lead
",-0.3612,0.7311,2019-09-08 00:00:00,1,"The Boss feels like someone wrote it on their phone from the toilet after eating some bad sushi. Either that or the director allowed for so much improvisation on the part of the cast that the plot fell apart.Melissa Mccarthy's character is an unrepentant, unfunny sociopath whose humour is entirely independent of context. Her jokes could easily be swapped around at random and it wouldn't affect the coherence of her scenes.The plot is just a mess of poorly explored ideas that are thrown away as soon as they're introduced.Peter Dinklage and Kristen Bell are highlights of the movie but even they can't make the humour work."
" Seriously?
",-0.1779,-0.6595,2019-07-31 00:00:00,1,Her future is in the past if she continues playing such rubbish. Nothing endearing about this. If I said this was bad someone would say that it isn't even that good!
" Had potential, but fell sort of its promise
",0.3634,0.9913,2019-07-17 00:00:00,6,"I like Melissa McCarthy. You have to admire her work ethic, and willingness to take risks. I loved her performance as the literary conwoman in Can You Ever Forgive Me? McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone, co-wrote The Boss, and McCarthy stars, but I feel it needed an objective party to edit the script and sharpen the comedy. As it is, McCarthy is given free rein to play Michelle Darnell, a scary, over the top celebrity corporate motivator who is sent to prison for insider trading. It's obviously inspired by Martha Stewart, and McCarthy has great fun playing someone with a massive ego who is taken down 30 pegs when she discovers she doesn't really have a life, post, jail, and that her fake friends and so-called business colleagues are lining up to knife her in the back on the way down. She clings on to her one remaining pal - her former assistant, Claire (Kristen Bell), and tries to rebuild her business empire via Claire's daughter's girl scout cookie drive. That's where the movie lost me. It got silly and obscure. I wasn't interested in finding out what happened next. I must admit, the huge, violent fight between two girl scout groups was a huge comedic risk on the filmmakers' part, and it is pretty funny. I mean, kids hitting and pulling and punching each other? Cars on fire? It was very politically incorrect, and a bit of an imitation of the news crew fight in Anchorman. But I thought it worked well. But the girl scout business angle didn't interest me much beyond that. Instead of being clever with the script, the movie became more about slapstick. Which is what Bridesmaids did, and I hated Bridesmaids. Maybe McCarthy doesn't trust her own ability with dialogue, which is why she reverts to cheap physical comedy. Don't get me wrong, a bit of slapstick can be fun, but it's no substitute for strong characters and a strong script."

" The only review that matters
",0.0258,-0.4941,2019-06-17 00:00:00,7,"Im reading the reviews here and what I gathered was that people who gave this movie 1 / 2 / 3 are somehow disturbed with the fact that it is done by a married couple, it is starred by a full figured woman who is married to the director and that it has majority of women. When men slap and kick each other in the movies nobody bats an eye. I believe that if the child gets in the movie business the parents are quite well aware of the pros and cons and they study the lines with their kids so its not Melissa's fault there. Shes a writer not a priest. There is a ""just for gags"" program on TV. Its stupid as hell but it makes people laugh. It's a comedy for goodness sake not a tfue story. As for the reviewer who told us to watch his review on YouTube... I wouldn't watch it even if you can pay me. Its not possible to sit for more than an hour in the movie and give it 1. Its not an ebay product. You only give it a 1 if you stayed for 5 minutes and felt it wasnt for you. This is a great comedy. Well done. Having said that... there were few mistakes like when Michelle told Claire that she had a cellmate for the last six months when really she was arrested for 5 months.What's with these critics who tell people not to watch certain movies? What the hell is that? Make your own conclusions yes... but dont tell people not to watch the movie just because you hated it. That's what shows that it goes deeper than the movie. I call that hating..."

Anyone who found this garbage funny was either paid or would laugh at a brick wall. PC garbage about 'strong' women who use foul language to no comedic effect is obviously Hollywood's idea of what the public wants and sadly some individuals meet their stereotype but if every 'comedy' is abysmal then an audience will applaud one that is less atrocious than the others, although I think that The Boss is as bad a sit can get."

",0.6808,0.979,2018-11-13 00:00:00,7,"This movie is really good fun. It is so fictional, its ridiculous, BUT, with all the connotations involved, I think it really captures what it takes to be successful. A delicate balance between being a boss, and being kind. The two have never mixed well in real life. If you're looking for light hearted fun, with some very good slapstick humour well choreographed, I'd recommend this. If you don't laugh out loud atleast twice, I'd be surprised"

It's an adult COMEDY movie. Of course it's going to be crude and silly, that's the point. To transport us our of our lives for an hour and a half. It's fun and has a totally new and random storyline. I'm sick of the same old romcoms which contain 0 comedy apart from a white middle aged ignorant a*shole wearing a funny cap and miss pronouncing words... the acting is good, the action is good and the writing is good. Enjoy!"
" Nothing Redeeming About This
",0.0,-0.4274,2018-09-10 00:00:00,2,"(Flash Review)Some of McCarthy's movies have been moderately amusing for the genre and often trying to mix in a nice core message. This movie was garbage and is bad for society as a whole. McCarthy plays an woman who was an orphaned child and made her own way in life and the business world. Caught for insider trading, she is released and begins to rebrand herself and is upset people how disliked she is as opposed to how Martha Stewart was treated. Watch as she tries to use her old ways by lying and backstabbing others for her benefit. But will she finally realize she needs to change her ways? That message is utterly buried under a tidal wave of crass and mean shenanigans. This had a WEAK script (even for the genre!) that relies on cursing for the sake of cursing even with kids in the scene as well as a mean-spirited, violent Girl Scout street brawl because the adult leaders are acting selfish by competing for sales. Any positive message is completely lost. The only redeeming character and the only time I genuinely laughed a bunch was Tyler Labine's secondary character. He was great. The rest was moldy garbage."

I was looking for a film that wouldn't go on for too long and that would'nt need me to engage my brain and that's exactly what I got.

" Too inappropriate
",0.0,0.6958,2018-06-24 00:00:00,5,"Although there are some laugh out loud moments in this movie, i found it to be far more inappropriate (especially considering it's a flick based on working with kids) and vulgar than it should have been. 
I usually like Melissa McCarthy, I find her hilarious and outspoken...but in this, she was too much! Many of the scenes also felt forced or unnecessary as well. The moment where she apologizes, really seems to lack much real emotion or substance. 
It literally felt like she'd lost her touch in this one.
Kristin Bell was good, but honestly...what Mother would leave her kid with an ex-con or let her hang out with a gutter mouthed woman...it's just not realistic!
I gave it a 5 for the simple fact that it was just about watchable."
" Predictable but enjoyable
",0.5927,0.8793,2018-05-24 00:00:00,7,"At first, ""The Boss"" looks like a run-of-the-mill redemption comedy. Melissa McCarthy play Michelle Darnelle, a business mogul jailed for insider trading. Taken back by her former assistant (Kristen Bell) upon release, Darnelle works her way back to the top by getting involved in her local community etc etc etc.Produced by McCarthy (also one of the writers), Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, ""The Boss"" earns its MA rating. Darnell is a ruthless self-centered, egotistical businesswoman, with former lover Renault (Peter Dinklage) and his assistant Stephan (VEEPs Timothy Simons) trying to stop her, which culminates in a swordfight in a mansion.Yes, ""The Boss"" plays it by-the-numbers, but is still enjoyable enough, especially if you're a McCarthy fan."

Being not liked by everyone, (Be nice to people on the way up...) she finds a home with a former employee (Kristen Bell) who makes great brownies. Renault (Peter Dinklage) is a former vindictive lover who has it in for her.The theme of the film is about friends as families, as Michelle undergoes a transformation. The film is cliche and hack in writing, although funny in some parts thanks to the delivery ability of Melissa McCarthy. Many scenes simply didn't work that could have worked such as the brownie melee, the martial arts fight, and the boob check scene that lasted pointlessly too long.This is not as good as ""Spy"" and certainly not as good as ""The Heat,"" but better than ""Tammy.""Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Adult talk."
" An unfunny ""comedy"" with unlikeable characters.
",0.0,0.8919,2018-01-07 00:00:00,1,"I hated this movie. I don't know if my expectations on a comedy is to high, but I expect to at least laugh a couple of times. It didn't happen in this, not even once. I actually almost fell asleep a couple of times. Why I even finished it is a question I will ask myself for a long time.The only character that was okay was the daughter of Bells character and that was just barely. Otherwise they was bland, boring or totally horrible like Michelle. I have seen in other reviews that if you don't like this you are a women-hating man that's afraid of strong women. Well, I'm a woman and am not at all intimidted by strong women. More power to them! But it doesn't change the fact that I just hated this movie. Sometimes it's just that simple."

I won't go on and on about the details of the film like some people do as I'd rather get those from watching the film myself! Just watch and remember it's for entertainment and enjoy. We recorded this movie and backed it up so many times to re-watch scenes because we were laughing so hard many times we couldn't hear it. Some classic lines and totally enjoyed this movie!!"

Melissa McCarthy is excellent, and so's Kristen Bell, Taylor Labine, Kristen Schaal, Peter Dinklage, and Cecily Strong. There's pathos (I think I know what that means) and I laughed a lot, having stopped to write this with 20 minutes to go. The great script was written around a really good brownie recipe, and McCarthy's ruthless ""Michelle Darnell"" runs into legal problems, then has to deal with innocent ""Girl Scout"" types, and decent grownups. Dinklage's character (He did this on a hiatus during GOT) is a very bad man who fights Darnell for the business. I think most people, by far, will like this one. The numbers above were just up to 12 June 2016, and the overseas profit must have been HUGE. I can't wait to see how it ends, so here I go."

When she is released, she has nowhere to go, so she hits up her ex-assistant Claire (Bell) for a place to stay. Claire has a young daughter, Rachel, and Claire asks Michelle to take her to a Young Dandelions meeting - the Young Dandelions are similar to the girl scouts. There, she gets the idea to recruit some of the Dandelions and go into business selling Claire's fabulous brownies. It takes off, with Claire as 50% partner. But an ex-boyfriend and enemy (Dinklage) is anxious to ruin Michelle yet again.I have no problem with swearing, no problem with sex, but if there's one thing I have no tolerance for is vulgarity. And the humor here is vulgar and geared to the lowest common denominator. Why someone as talented as Melissa McCarthy does this type of film is beyond me. She's better than this - either she or Hollywood don't think so. Is it because she's overweight? If so it's even more insulting.I'm a huge fan of Kristen Bell's and wish this had been a better role for her.There were some funny slapstick scenes and the premise was good, as was the cast, but the script was bad.

This is not a comedy for everyone. Children probably wouldn't be watching this. There is VERY strong language & there are sexual themes through out the movie. It's not subtle. It is vulgar.I would describe this movie's humor similar to that of ""Sausage Party"", being that if one is easily offended they most likely would not enjoy this movie.Personally however, I think it's delightfully absurd, cheeky, & playfully cantankerous with just the right kind of trashy."

As for me, I think the film was missing something most comedies have...a reason to care about the leading character.Melissa McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, a self-help guru who treats everyone around her like dirt. She's amassed a huge fortune by lecturing, selling books and more....much like a foul-mouthed version of Tony Robbins. However, when she's convicted of insider trading, she's sent to prison. While the sentence isn't very long, when she leaves she learns that pretty much everything she owned has been confiscated. So, she moves in with her old assistant, Claire (Kristen Bell), though there is no conceivable reason why Claire would have anything to do with her...as she's completely repellent and awful and has learned nothing from her ordeal. She's also a god-awful influence on Claire's daughter. What's next and, more importantly, who cares?!If the notion of seeing McCarthy play a god-awful character who constantly curses and acts vulgar, then this film is for you. Some vulgarity can be funny (such as in ""Step Brothers"")...constant vulgarity and nastiness simply makes you wonder ""what were these people thinking???!!!"". I thought it was all way over the top and nothing like her sweet film ""Spy"". I liked ""Spy"" and liked McCarthy's character. But with ""Boss"", I found her and her character very easy to hate. The film is occasionally funny...but not enough to make it possible to overlook McCarthy as Michelle. In fact, after a while I tired of all this and just turned it off and found something better...it was nearly over but I just didn't care."

But, I just couldn't do that to myself. I couldn't sit through the painfully bad acting and poor writing. Just ten minutes in and it was already a stinking mess of awfulness. Unfortunately, I don't have much more to say about this movie, but I have a feeling it wasn't going to get any better. Why does Hollywood allow such crap to get made? I've seen bad movies, and this one has now taken the top spot. Maybe if it had been an 8 minute movie, I'd have given it more than 1 star."

The bizarre cast of characters in this film provided for some absurd and funny moments, but the best scenes were between Darnell and her newest protÃ©gÃ© â€“ the young Rachel, who quickly became like family to the money hungry Darnell. McCarthy always excels at physical comedy, but it was her character's confidence and quick wit that carried the film. Overall, I simply loved this film."

I will say this about the film, though: Melissa McCarthy is one of the most brilliant comedians of the 21st Century--she's ""all in"" to her performance and completely believable (and hilarious). If you need a laugh in these dark days of 2017 onward, I strongly recommend this film. It's not realistic, it has formulaic elements, but the production values are great, the actors commit to their roles and it's an enjoyable escape.

Melissa McCarthy is the same character pretty much every movie and her act can be entertaining and if your a big fan of her you will probably like it. I am getting somewhat tired of it and it started after seeing Tammy but after seeing this one Tammy was actually not even that bad. This can be hard to watch and the plot isn't worth going into great detail but McCarthy stars a orphan turned millionaire who then loses her job again due to her ex boyfriend Renault who's real name is Ron. The movie has its moments mostly when McCarthy does things like gets thrown into a wall, or falling down a staircase or hitting a tennis ball at some guy. However the character she plays in this movie is unpleasant, she was an orphan who no-one liked and when she gets rich she treats everybody poorly and throughout the movie even when she is poor again she is crude nasty but not too funny. Another thing is that I can't tell who the target audience is there's a kid who's in the movie and makes it feel like a family comedy but then she does some horrible things that shouldn't be in a family movie. I got pretty stoned during this movie and even then it was hard to sit to but I am just not into McCarthy enough where I can enjoy a whole 90 minutes of her comedy . Like I said if you're into McCarthy you might like it but otherwise not really worth a watch"
" the problem with this movie is...
",-0.4019,-0.6287,2017-01-26 00:00:00,4,"Melissa Mccarthy's, Michelle, is too obnoxious. You can't route for her to change because she's too rude to be humble. The film starts out with Michelle admitting to insider trading, but she doesn't get it's a big deal. So she goes to jail for a few months, gets out and is broke. She gets her old assistant, Claire, to take her in.She gets an idea to start a brownie business since Claire's are so good. Next thing you know, she back stabs Claire by selling the business because she thinks Claire was going to but she wasn't. Then they have to try to steal back the contract.FINAL VERDICT: Really not to funny. Michelle is just mean and it's not a good character for Mccarthy. I'd say skip it."

Still, McCarthy is so, so watchable (she has perfected the sideways, barely heard moment). McCarthy is also able - remarkably - to still make explosions of profanity funny. Unfortunately, and before midpoint, this goes completely off the rails, and aside from the way too trite story element of emotional denial and epiphany. You keep wanting someone to give McCarthy something decent to work with. The earlier, admittedly very broad farce simply degenerates into stupid and unfunny cartoonishness, and it's just too bad. You can almost feel the actors' wondering of how and why any comic promise was allowed to be destroyed. Melissa and we deserve better."

She and Bell are a good team, but you may feel that the sparks are not really visible. The movie flows along nicely and there is enough profanity and everything else one could ask for from a ""grown-up"" comedy movie.But is it enough? The answer will probably be no. And that is not to say that you won't enjoy many of the things on display here. There is a love hate relationship at almost every corner and they all kind of make sense. One of the discoveries of the movie is the kid actor though. The casting department did a good job there. Not much more to enjoy though ..."
