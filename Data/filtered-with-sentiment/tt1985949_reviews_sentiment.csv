" The Importance of Negative Emotions
",-0.296,0.6259,2021-04-03 00:00:00,7,"My favorite thing about this movie is the ultimate emphasis on embracing ""negative"" emotions in a healthy way. The entire society on Bird Island lives a toxic positive lifestyle, in which all negative emotions are pushed down and all negative citizens are ostracized. But ultimately, it is the birds' anger towards the injustice that is done to their children that will save them. The most iconic line in the movie is Red's line, when he says, ""We don't need happy, detached birds. We need angry flocking birds.""I did think that there would be a few dunderheads on here who would harp on the perceived anti-immigrant message. Alternatively, I don't see the pigs as immigrants from third world countries. I see them as being representative of Americans/Brits/any colonizer nation taking resources from the less developed bird nation. And the birds retaliating against the pigs are the consequences of America's or Britain's actions coming back to bite them in the rear.I think the greatest twist about this movie is how the tides turn for Red. Typically, these lighthearted kids' movies start off with a beloved protagonist who ultimately earns the scorn of their community for messing up in a big way. Angry Birds turns that around for Red by making him a hated protagonist who ultimately earns the trust and admiration of his community.A few minor nitpicks: I loved the ultimate romance between Terrence and Matilda. But I think it could've been more developed in the story.I think that Mighty Eagle's character was useless. (Unless he, too, was a sneak diss symbol for America?) All he really did was force Red to realize that he had to take action against the pigs himself. But based on Red's personality, it seemed like that would've happened regardless of Mighty Eagle's influence.And finally, there is no explanation for why the birds don't fly. It's not enough to chalk it up their weight, since Mighty Eagle can fly.In conclusion, Angry Birds is a fun movie to watch, but it still manages to be refreshing in its own way."

Ridiculously saturated colors that give you a headache, because they need to keep kids attention I guess. Boring plot, terrible jokes and terrible characters. My life is worse for watching even a few seconds of this heap of garbage"

Just a waste of time"
" Is this talking about colonialism?
",0.0,0.1727,2020-12-31 00:00:00,6,"To me, the story felt like a take on colonialism, since the pigs come to Bird Island, establish themselves and then take the island's most valuable resources (or in this case, items--the eggs).The jokes were good, not great or gut-wrenching funny. I do like the characters, though.But, the direction was bad. That scene with the explosions was so messy I couldn't tell what was going on. I knew what was happening, of course, but it was difficult to watch.The movie was good, though. I don't know why so many people don't like it. It's not bad."

" It's not THAT bad
",0.431,0.9765,2020-09-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie was actually not as bad as most people say it is. I mean I do agree that this movie kinda changed up Angry Birds a little too much, I mean adding limbs to the birds is okay in my opinion it's nothing sinful. This movie actually did make me laugh a few times especially with Chuck, Bomb, and The Mighty Eagle. It's mainly the idea of this movie that causes a problem but it's honestly harmless. The animation is fine, the actors are pretty good at the voices, and characters do learn something throughout the film, it's not just a silly mess. I mean come on it's better than The Emoji Movie atleast."
" What was the point?
",0.0,0.274,2020-07-14 00:00:00,3,"The voice cast do their utter best to make this work and you can tell the screenwriters were trying to string some kind of interesting narrative together here, but alas there is virtually nothing about this film worth any amount of praise or note. After the inciting incident of the pigs invading the bird island, the plot falls to pieces because that is all that happens in the app it's based on. There's no conclusion to the app, just level after level of the same thing, which is what this film feels like, scene after scene of the same filler nonsense because there simply isn't anything else for the characters to do.A pointless waste of time."
" PURE AWFUL
",-0.4588,0.7845,2020-06-25 00:00:00,2,"With questionable jokes related to the word pluck, truly unfunny moments, jokes that don't really make sense, and a 6-yeargap between the peak of the original game's popularity and this movie, ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is truly awful and shows that Rovio will soon be bankrupt, making them think that this movie is their best chance at making the Angry Birds brand profitable again."
" The Angry Birds Movie
",-0.5106,0.3932,2020-06-16 00:00:00,5,Good Movie. The animation in the movie was excellent. The movie was funny. The movie was not so interesting. The movie bored and lagged because it deals with the same problem throughout the movie. The movie had some unwanted scenes and songs. Good Movie.
" Could be worse, could be better
",-0.0516,0.9652,2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"People weren't expecting much from this film when it was announced and I can confirm that it is no masterpiece but it will still give you a great time. The characters all had their own distinct (and angry) personality and it was fun to see their adventures. For an adaptation of a video game (a simple mobile game at that), it actually incorporated the birds and the catapult very deftly and naturally into a thrilling story."
" This Is How You Do A ""Franchise"" Movie
",0.0,0.9888,2020-05-13 00:00:00,9,"When I think of any ""franchise"" movie, I cringe. Movies based on games or other properties that are only made to cash in on a name and sell more product. While this isn't always a bad thing when done well, lately it seems that is the ONLY formula needed for making a movie based on some franchise, the Emoji Movie is a prime example. It was a literal waste of time and was nothing more than a two hour advertisement to ""sell"" social media. I, like many others, took one look at the trailer and thought ""who the hell wants to see an Angry Birds movie""? Well, as I was perusing our local pawn shop's movie collection, someone else must have had that same notion because among the blurays was an unopened copy for only $4. I figured for that price, if it was terrible, I would only be out $4. I was pleasantly surprised, however. Scratch that, I probably would have paid full price to own this.I actually had no idea that this came from Sony, had I known that I probably would have at least given it more of a chance. The problem is that Sony is very, VERY hit or miss with their animation studio. After all, this is the same company that killed Popeye and gave us the Emoji Movie. Granted, studios like Pixar has some good and not so good movies, though they're all enjoyable to watch, but Sony seems to get one right and then completely fail the next. Strangely enough, Angry Birds was the one they got right. You don't get quite the same heartfelt connection with the characters that you do with a Pixar movie, but it's still there and it gets you invested and interested to know more about the characters and how the bad things affect them and their world. It makes the movie much more enjoyable when it's there to tell a story, not lecture you about how bad you are or try to sell you something you really don't need.All of the characters are enjoyable, their personalities are all based on who they are in the game, but it's not pushed to the point that it gets old and often times makes for some fun humor. Oh, I should talk about the humor. I was very surprised at a lot of the subtle adult humor they worked in. While not a prude myself, I wondered just who the target audience was to watch this. Yes, parents may often watch a movie with their kids and a lot of the jokes would probably go over their heads anyway, but it really made me wonder. That being said, I had absolutely no problem with the humor and I believe that if they had not gone that direction, the movie would have been an absolute bore. Yes, a lot of the bird and pig puns are tongue-in-cheek and cringey, but it was all done in a way that you can forgive the writers for even thinking of such terrible jokes. You've laughed at terrible jokes before, don't kid yourself.Even if you hated the game and you don't like ""franchise"" movies, at least give this one a chance, you might find yourself having a good time."
" Movie out of game.
",0.0,0.765,2020-05-01 00:00:00,6,"People who played ""Angry bird"" Game, will love this movie. Others will not find that much fun, i believ."
" Angry birds
",-0.5106,0.998,2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,"I think that because my expectations were so low going in, I ended up really enjoying this movie. The promotional footage and images with the bright colors and goofy character designs made me think that this movie was being targeted for really little kids, but DON'T BE FOOLED. This is definitely aimed for the 10 and older demographic, as evidenced by all the pee jokes and innuendos. That being said, I was delightfully surprised by the clever humor, beautiful animation, and insanely fun climax. I must say, though, that this movie's greatest achievement is having one of the best voice casts I've ever seen. Jason Sudeikis is a strong center to the film, and his deadpan delivery makes me upset that he is no longer attached to that Fletch reboot. Bill Hader creates a Gregory Peck, George C. Scott-like persona as the villainous Leonard. Peter Dinklage almost steals the show as the a flawed icon of the birds. There's also some great work being done by the likes of Maya Rudolph, Kate McKinnon, Keegan Michael-Key, and, of all people, Sean Penn, and it's fun to hear some great TV actors like Tony Hale, Danielle Brooks, Ike Barinholtz and Tituss Burgess in smaller roles. The highlights, though, are Josh Gad and Danny McBride, who help create two of the most memorable sidekicks in modern film animation. While watching this movie, I kept comparing it to Zootopia. While Zootopia had a much more original premise and all-around creativity, Angry Birds was stronger in terms of humor and all-around enjoyment, which I think comes from the simplicity of the story and characters."
" Unconfortable prejudice

" Won't leave you angry, but doesn't quite sore
",0.6014,0.9817,2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"Considering this is a video game movie, I expected a lot worse. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it's not a recommendation. Considering we've had some phenomenal animated films this year like ""Kubo,"" ""Zootopia"", and ""The Little Prince"", this should be ashamed to be released the same year as those. That being said the plot was surprisingly good. I wasn't sure how they'd be able to make a plot out of the ""Angry Birds"" games, but they pulled it off surprisingly well. There were also a lot of great visual puns that gave me a chuckle. And other than Josh Gad, all the voice actors did a good job, too. But that's really all the good things I have to say about this film. Here's the bad:
First of all....Josh Gad. I find him annoying in everything. The man cannot speak without yelling everything. If you have to yell to be funny, you're not funny. You're just desperate for attention. This film also had something I hate in animated films: Pop culture references that will be outdated in 2 years. Sometimes pop culture reference can work (There's actually a really good spoof on ""The Shining"" that made me laugh), but most of them are just there to pander to the millennials. (""Squad goals! Insta-ham). Boy, did typing those out make me cringe! There's also a lot of really lowbrow bodily function humor that even Dreamworks would think is too far. And, I'm sorry to say, but the filmmakers felt the need to slip in some ""adult humor"". There were some really inappropriate joke and references that had me saying ""This is a KIDS' movie?!"" There's actually some borderline PG-13 humor. How was this only released with PG? If you really want to show this to your kids (I beg of you, please don't. Don't insult their intelligence) at least have the decency to filter it on VidAngel ,because, boy does this really need it. Otherwise you may get some really uncomfortable questions from your kids. My final complaint: ""Time slows down/stops while a character runs fast"" cliche. We've seen it before. It's not funny or clever anymore. Please let this gag die. Overall, not bad for a video game movie, but that's not a phrase that should be taken as positive.
Grade: C+ 6.5/10 3/5 stars"
" Silly funny and fun with great animation, but does't bring anything new to the genre.
",0.6908,0.9513,2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,"Silly, funny and fun with great animation, the film is a real joy to watch from beginning to end. It's got a good story where every scene is vibrant and filled with colour, action, comedy and music. Plenty of jokes for adults and kids, they really captured the personalities of the birds, although the pigs could have done with being more memorable. It doesn't really do anything new or different in the animated movie market, but I enjoyed it a lot."

" Much better than I expected
",0.4404,0.4165,2019-11-05 00:00:00,8,"I honestly thought that I was gonna hate this movie for several reasons. First off, a friend of mine from Malaysia made fun of the designs of the characters because they did not seem to look like the actual game. I was a bit frustrated but this wasn't really an issue in the end. Secondly, I assumed the movie would suck because of the bad reviews. For example, people often complained about the jokes in this movie, so I tried avoiding it altogether until my mom decided to rent this film from Redbox. This film ended up being a lot funnier than I expected. The cast being from Saturday Night Live made this movie enjoyable (especially Maya Rudolph's character). Definitely would recommend!"

That's a pretty unexpected moral takeaway for a kids' movie, and it's just one surprise of many in ""The Angry Birds Movie,"" a fast, fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that, at its zenith, had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens. Establishing a basic psychological motivation for the fiery disposition shared by the feathered folk of Bird Island, this irreverent origin story takes an appropriately loose, elastic approach to its larger narrative, with frequent detours to fill in daffier details of its mad, mad, mad, mad story world."

It actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting - I mean, it's based on an app... It's obviously meant for kids and ""tweens"", but for a kids movie, it's actually not bad. I have no idea how it got 10's (certainly didn't deserve that), but if you have to watch it to appease your kids or nieces/nephews, you're not gonna sit there wanting to pull your hair out or pray for it to end. Definitely better than Spongebob or some of the other insufferable tripe that's out there."
" Abominable...
",0.0,0.8865,2019-05-19 00:00:00,2,"This film does not have any redeeming features, whatsoever. The story involves an aggressive, ill tempered, violent bird, who makes excuses for his behaviour and accepts no responsibility for his actions. He is sent to anger management, which he does not take seriously. When the loathsome, nefarious pigs show up, he decides to become the hero of the birds.
This is definitely not a show for small children, with such 'jokes' as the birds saying, ""Pluck me,"" and, ""peckerhead,"" which my children decided were great phrases to imitate.
Obviously the bird, and his friends, overcome the pigs, and are considered heroes.
Overall, a film to teach children that it is alright to be a terrible person, as you will get away with it, and you will succeed in life anyway.
The second star I've given this is for the few, generally funny, scrubs of the film."

What happens when an island full of happy-go-lucky birds fall foul/fowl of duplicitous green pigs?On a small island with a huge eagle-shaped mountain in its centre lives a group of birds, going about their anthropomorphic business. Red spends most of his time being rather cross, but most of the other birds are fairly equable. Into their lives comes a boatful of green pigs, all hail-fellow-well-met on the surface, but actually bent on a nefarious, nay, despicable plan.Angry Birds is, I am told, a popular computer game for mobile phones and the like. I confess I have never played it, so I approached this CGI feature without any prejudgement other than the trailer, which I found quite amusing. So what can I tell you?It has a decent plot - simple, of course (as kids are a big part of the intended audience), but with some genuine suspense and jeopardy in it. Lives are at stake here! And there is some genuine emotion, too: it wouldn't be unreasonable for your eyes to start watering a bit here and there. It is very bright and colourful with pleasing animation, in terms of both design and execution, albeit possibly a little over-kinetic in places. I initially thought the character design was rather basic, but it actually fits each character well and, of course, reflects the game. Voices also match the characters well, and the voice actors, being seasoned pros one and all, invest their characters with genuine personality (it's amazing how much difference a good voice cast can make in an animated film). Crucially, Red is a very likeable character despite being angry, which is a point of some importance given that he is the protagonist.The last two CGI films I've seen have both disappointed me, so it is pleasing to report that this one didn't. And I should also report that it is very funny. It is crammed chock full of gags: sight gags, character gags, verbal gags, action gags, and they nearly all work. There is occasional toilet humour - you're probably not to worried about that given where you are reading this, but there are those who may object to their children being exposed to (for instance) the first Eagle gag which had tears streaming down my face. But then, I am very infantile in my appreciation of humour. If you're taking your kids, they'll find it a funny film, and you will enjoy sitting there picking up the references which skate over their heads (there's one from Kubrick's The Shining, for instance).The 3D has its moments, but is fairly non-essential.This is a strong 9 out of 10, maybe even a full 10 if the wind is in the right direction. And I'm not eggs-agerating."
" Loved this more than I expected
",0.5994,0.9681,2018-05-07 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to see this film since I first saw the trailer however never got around to it till it went on Netflix and found that I loved it! 
It has comedy for both adults and children and made me laugh which was a great surprise to myself. Highly recommend giving this a watch"
" I guarantee all the 10/10 reviews are from trolls.
",0.25,-0.7019,2018-03-25 00:00:00,2,"The only reason I decided to watch this movie was out of curiosity. How did they make a movie out of such a simplistic phone app? Luckily it was available on Netflix. You can always count on Netflix to have just the greatest content. Plot - This movie is mostly filler. There are a few poorly executed subplots in this thing. Hard to tell which one is supposed to be the main one. The script is very bad. This movie is mainly just a collection of references and rip-offs of better and more entertaining movies. Like X-Men and The Shining. Characters - They're all poorly written and annoying. Most of them are morons. Enough said. Animation - The animation isn't very good. Its not terrible though. There are some odd choices that were made. All the trees have scales for some reason.PG? - This movie is full of sexual innuendos. There's also a lot of adult references. I'm not sure that this movie is appropriate for children. There is a scene where a bird pees for over a minute (I'm not even exaggerating - the bird pees for like over a minute into a lake for some reason). Its very gross and unnecessary. There is also an attempted suicide that's mostly glossed over. Comedy - This movie isn't funny. I guess the idea that someone thought that this movie would be a good idea is funny, and some stuff is so cringy that its funny, but there aren't a lot of legitimate laughs you're likely to get. Some of the set ups are so instantly stupid and nonsensical that I had to laugh. The jokes themselves don't worth though. This movie is dumb and not worth watching."
" Something isn't kosher with the pigs
",0.0,0.872,2017-12-05 00:00:00,8,"Red attends anger management classes and meets other angry birds. Pigs come to island and steal eggs to make an omelet on their island. Only Red can save the day.The film used slapstick humor for the kids and an occasional scene that adults can enjoy such as ""The Shining"" pig twins. I haven't heard ""egg-cellent"" since Vincent Price spoke those words on ""Batman."" The film is light on heavy themes and saved money by avoiding high priced stars for the voices. Red was easy to identify with, but the rest of the birds were a bit shallow in character, but hey, it is just a movie for kids. Hatching eggs uses phrases similar to child birth for humor. Might want to wait for an inexpensive rental.Guide: Bird standing and urinating like a man. Uses phrases like ""Pluck my life"" and ""Flocking birds."""
" Hey-you-hoo!
",0.0,0.9293,2017-11-13 00:00:00,10,"The film is ""somewhat"" based on the ""Angry Birds"" game. The elements are all there, the non-flying birds, which become angry at a certain point, the green pigs that love eggs for meal, some gadgets and even the arcade era nostalgia. Fortunately, it doesn't try to follow the original game's story line, what would be amazingly boring, for sure. Instead, the film follows one of the game's characters' daily life, Red.There are three main acts, the first being the story of Red's life and why he has anger issues, the second tells the story of the pigs' plot to steal the birds' eggs, and the third is the rescue and escape from the pigs' island. There are some intermissions, like the anger management class and the quest for Mighty Eagle. The film loses some comic momentum on the third act, replacing it with more action, but it's still very funny.Although it's a computer animated cartoon, it's definitely not a safe Disney-like feature. It contains all sort of jokes, from childish (e.g., Red smashing the cake) to adult ones, including some scatology (e.g., Chuck dropping ice cream on the policeman and Mighty Eagle ""soiling"" the sacred lake). Everything is taken lightly, though, so even the more adult-oriented jokes are played on the safe zone (arguably, some people are more easily offended than others, but then again, they should just stay away from anything not Disney-ish). In a scale of zero to five, being zero ""Finding Nemo"" and five, ""Sausage Party"", ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is somewhere in between two and three, meaning there are some ""suggestive"" jokes, but absolutely nothing explicit. That said, it's noteworthy that there are no swearing, not a single bad word anywhere, thanks to the clever scripting and intelligent dialogues, and violence is at a ""Tom and Jerry"" level, so when TNT goes off, the most that happens is people getting sooth on their faces.If you have never played or, at least, seen the ""Angry Birds"" game, you may miss a few jokes. If you are still a child, you may miss some other jokes, too. Even so, there is so much fun packed in this film that it's a guaranteed fun ride. Warning, if you were born on the last half of the 20th century, you may laugh your lungs out watching this!"
" Hilarious and Clever
",0.6908,0.9911,2017-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie is hilarious. Is it deep, thought-provoking, tear-inducing cinema like Pixar? No. However, what this movie is is a hilarious, dry, sarcastic, satirical comedy that can appeal to anyone, but will be the funniest to adults who understand all of the subtle jokes.This movie thrives off of its breakneck pacing. It keeps the jokes coming, and this can be largely attributed to the main character, Red. Every word out of his mouth is comedy gold. His commentary on the ridiculously optimistic world around him is absolutely hilarious. The other main characters, Chuck and Bomb, have their moments too. The writers have a lot of fun with the ridiculousness that is a bird that explodes when he's angry. The finale of the movie was absolutely perfect. I honestly couldn't think of a better way to have ended it. The entire film is somewhat satirical in nature, but the way they tie the movie back to the game in a tongue-in-cheek, winking-at-the-camera way is just perfect and hilarious.The writers also managed to work in a bunch of other clever moments, including a RickRoll, the song, ""Sound of the Da Police"", a shining reference/spoof, and many others that I can't think of right now. It is also nice and short; it doesn't overstay its welcome like many movies do these days.I recommend this movie to pretty much anyone."

" A terrible adaptation of a pretty addicting video game.
",0.0258,-0.9972,2017-05-15 00:00:00,3,"I'm not going to lie. The idea for an Angry Birds movie actually did appeal to me for some reason. I did like the video game. It was pretty fun and really addicting causing the game to be one of the most download smartphone apps of all time. The game had also made a series of animated shorts that actually not that bad. So, I did have hopes for ""The Angry Birds Movie"" to be pretty decent. That was a mistake I made. A huge mistake I made, because this movie is just awful. I mean, really bad. It's certainly not one of the worst animated movies ever made, but trust me. It's an absolutely terrible movie.The story of the movie focuses on Red (Jason Sudeikis) a bird whose anger problems end him up in an anger management class along with four others like Chuck (Josh Gad), Bomb (Danny McBride), Matilda (Maya Rudolph), and Terrence (Sean Penn). If you want to know why Red acts this way, it turns out he had one of those clichéd backstories where it's revealed that he was bullied by the other birds his age because he has no parents and has big eyebrows. After being in the class for some time, a boatload of pigs arrive at the island where they live, lead by a king pig (Bill Hader) who decides to become friends with the birds. However, it turns out to be a lie because the pigs take all the eggs from the birds and leaves the island so they can eat them on their own island. The birds turn to Red for help and it's up to him and his friends from the anger management class to follow the pigs and get back the eggs.I should have realized the doom I was heading into when I realized that the screenwriter worked on ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. The story is not the worst thing about the movie. It does follow the video game rather faithfully, right down to the slingshots. However, it's really clichéd. It has scenes we've seen so many times in other movies with no changes. The characters, on the other hand, are awful. I never liked a single solitary character in this entire movie. Every single character in this movie was either annoying, stupid, or just jerks and I hated every single one of them, particular are main character Red who I think said over twenty puns in the span of an hour and a half. Speaking of the puns, the jokes are another horrible thing about this film. The jokes in this film range from being disgusting to inappropriate. These jokes really annoyed me and disgusted me to the point that I decided would never show my kids this film. For example, there was a scene where a character was reading a book Fifty Shades of Green. Yeah, good idea promoting a book that has tons of sex in it in a kids movie. The only good thing in this entire film was the animation. It looked very pretty had nice colors and looked at least like an Angry Birds movie. I just wish that I put the movie on mute so I didn't have to listen to the horrendous dialogue. Overall, I really hated ""The Angry Birds Movie"". It's truly an awful movie. I really wished somebody at the studio had taken a look at the script and discarded it before the film started production because if they did, it would have been one hundred percent better. If your kids really want to see something related to Angry Birds, just go buy them ""Angry Birds Toons"" and don't waste money on this disaster. It's really not worth watching."

However, despite the rarity of the direction (Let's face it, Mortal Kombat killed the genre......) this is a jewel of a find.It's a fun little romp through the imaginary world of those little bitty birds we spend so much time flinging with our phones and tablets.By the end, you'll feel great and you may even want to fling some more birdies at those dastardly pigs.The best line though is definitely referring to Mathilda shooting 'fireballs out her butt'.....Kids will love it and adults will enjoy it."

This movie is honestly terrible.The thing with the Angry Birds Movie which I do not understand at all is that it's supposed to be aimed at a family-friendly audience, however there are jokes galore here that do not fit in that category.Unfunny adult innuendos, twerking, toilet humor. I'm not the kind of person who would even be into this but I was genuinely disgusted about how crude this movie is.And also, instead of the movie being dragged on and long just like any other simple story being adapted to the big screen, the movie goes way too fast. I couldn't keep up with what was going on. Even in places where it seems normal it doesn't ever stop for a second. There was an interesting premise to this movie but it just didn't catch on to me because of the humor and how fast the movie goes. And I had to click off after watching for a while because I couldn't take it. I almost had an aneurysm."
" Weak, and just gets worse the longer it goes on
",-0.7184,0.7642,2017-04-20 00:00:00,3,"Red is a bird, a flightless bird on an island of flightless birds. He also has a problem - anger. After an incident at a child's party he is sent to anger management classes. There he meets some interesting characters.Was interesting for about five minutes, and then quickly resorted to cheap jokes and mindless action scenes. Plot is random at best and just gets worse and worse the longer it goes on. I think the writers exhausted any original ideas they had by the 20-minute mark.This makes you wonder who the target audience is. Judging by the weakness of the humour and juvenileness of the script, you'd have to say really young kids. But then there are some jokes and scenes aimed squarely at adults. Or maybe the producers just wanted to cash in on the Angry Birds game, figuring that people who enjoyed the game would watch the movie out of curiosity. Doesn't matter whether the movie is any good, as long as people pay good money to see it...Whatever the reason, this is sloppy, half-baked movie making and does animated movies a massive disservice."

" So much fun
",0.5542,0.9417,2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"The Angry Birds movie is so much fun. Of course there are some crude jokes, but that's typical to any kind of movie. I think having an American (I'm assuming) screenwriter affects the movie a lot. It makes it easier to gain a larger audience world wide. I'm astonished by the English-speaking cast. First of all, Jason Sudeikis as the lead, Peter Dinklage as the Mighty Eagle and Sean Penn as the big guy who basically doesn't even say anything? The cast speaks what kind of a big deal this movie was to make.Very funny movie, but of course very typical plot-wise. But that's how it is with most animated mainstream children's movies."
" Average Animated Fun,
",0.5106,0.9804,2017-03-10 00:00:00,5,"Angry Birds is a mediocre movie with an average plot and a stellar voice cast. It is whimsical fun that has a lot of surprisingly funny moments, terrifically delivered by its cast. Jason Sudekis is stellar in the lead role, delivering the character's anger with great passion. He is also joined by the likes of Danny McBride, Bill Hader and Josh Gad, it has a stellar ensemble. The film does not try very hard to be entertaining for adults, I understand that it is aimed at kids, but it did not have to be solely this way. It could have taken a note from the likes of Toy Story and Shrek, making it humorous and clever enough that it is not unbearable for adults. It's plot is very typical, there is really nothing other than the story. It has a beginning, s middle, and end, it has the same structure as any kids movie and nothing in between. It is mindless, simple fun that I will admit had me smiling at times, even if there is nothing there to amaze. Funny and forgettable, if you are looking for a film for your kids to enjoy, Angry Birds might be a delightful choice, otherwise you should avoid. When an island populated by birds is invaded by green pigs, it's up to three birds to put a stop to this."

Can't wait to see the next sequel and I have full of ideas, but it's difficult for me to show them my ideas for the movie. I hope I can see Silver in the next movie and how she deflected to the birds and was raised by pigs. Will Red finally get a love interest. I will think Silver can be voiced by a comedian as she has a very funny sense of humor. Hope there will be improvements for the film series and make it more addicting like the games. Maybe Red should have a love triangle, I'm crazy about love!"

",0.7906,0.9913,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Movies can be put into 2 categories: thought provoking and easy watching. Angry Birds The Movie definitely falls in the latter category..... and there is nothing wrong with that. The colour, slapstick laughs and cute fuzzy looking characters will appeal to the younger audiences but there are plenty of hidden gems in there for us adults too. The hero of the story Red (Jason Sudkis) isn't as multi dimensional as the special effects but he carries the playful story. The graphics are impressive and the story is as good as it can be based on the premise of a mobile app game (one I confess to getting stuck on level 16 of the original). But lets be honest, you aren't going to be watching a movie about a war of flightless birds and green pigs for its twisting narrative. An easy watch for the family and great for a Sunday morning.... although you will never look at crystal clear water the same again :)"

But then again I just read a topic by someone comparing the movie to ISIS and Angela Merkel. I almost lost my train of thought, when I just read the subject line.

" Not good enough
",-0.3412,-0.9559,2017-01-18 00:00:00,4,"I am very sad to say that, but the movie disappointed me musically, graphically and from the story viewpoint. Definitely it didn't meet my expectations, and I think that it was made just for the seek of money. The start was very fading, I was very bored and the voice actor of Red disturbed me. I think that he did not suit to the character at all. Visual shape of birds was very poor. I don't say that I expected the exact copies of original angry birds, but especially the Red and Chuck were very oval to me, too much oval. Despite I loved the choice of Chuck voice actor. After the poor beginning, the movie started to grow up dynamically, yet it lacked humour, or it contained very vast humour. I appreciate the concept of ""anger"" removal, but wasn't being angry the very base of birds? Didn't all birds should supposed to be angry? Not just chuck, red and black bomb one? Honestly, the eagle thing was living the movie a bit, but some inappropriate parts of movie were ruining the so-so way of a movie. Movie didn't have consistent dynamics, it didn't have a positive gradation to me, the start was very vast, strange, lacking humour, then when it started to make sense, yet there were very strange parts, like the creators had some idea, then it got lost, then it came up again, then it got lost and so on. The end, egg salvation, heroism of red somehow made the reputation of the movie better, but it could be done much wiser than it was. Generally speaking, there were parts I enjoyed very much mixed with very stupid or boring parts, which could be substituted with something more witty or logic, or omitted. It could be better. 5/10"
