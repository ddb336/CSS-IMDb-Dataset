" Pretty Good for Teen Time Travel
",0.7269,0.6369,2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"I must admit, I'm a sucker for a time travel movie and paradoxes and such. That being said, I usually detest any movie that's based on teens because they're usually contain sophomoric humor and poor writing. This actually pulled off time travel around teens and made it interesting. It was pleasantly surprising. Even slipped in a little twist at the end. Kind of surprised I'd never heard of it before watching."
" Would have been much better movie if not for filming like Blair Witch home video
",-0.1803,-0.7906,2021-03-18 00:00:00,5,"Had such great potential, ruined by the home video format. Whoever thought that that is a format viewers want to watch was an idiot. Blair Witch started it and was Corp because of it. A real filming, interspersed with a live filming clips would be ok, but to do the whole thin? Even parts where there KS no way possible for anyone to be doing the filming, detracts and is annoying."
" Time what? No, no. It's a colossally bufoonish waste of time

Thank God I did! Just read dna-1138's review and save yourself the aggravation. Why are 98% of all movies just pure garbage lately?"

",0.0,-0.895,2020-12-01 00:00:00,2,"The Boring Witch Project has a lot to answer for!
Not only was it a terminally asinine film but it has the dubious distinction of starting the 'found footage/hand held cheap arse camera work' genre!
It's not artsy, it's not cool, it doesn't make us feel like we are there, it's just bloody annoying.
This film has real promise and a great idea, unfortunately the director ruined it!"

" Good start, disapointing ending
",0.4404,0.9866,2020-11-10 00:00:00,5,"SPOILER ALERT.
It started as a pretty decent back to the future type of movie, allthough its a bit hard to comprehend the concept of a genius teenager build up such an amount of knowledge in his short life. Usually it takes several life times to gather that knowledge even for the brightest minds like f.i. Stephen Hawkins. And remarkable he could not land a full scholarship at MIT. But this aside, you have to use writers imagination to get started. All the build up to the moment of succes in creating the time machine and creating the circumstances to bring the future lovebirds together are all in line of a good solid movie. Even the middle part were some kind of moral accountability is handled like were only use it together and only for responcible purposes is up to the standards. Remarkable though how quickly they build a compact version of the machine, Steve Jobs would have given his right arm to sign-up those dudes. From that point on the movie went down the drain. Al the test they applied concerned only selfish motivated and juvenile reasons like winning the lotery, go to main events in the past, mainly concerts they want to see, a road that's bound to spin out off controle and totally out of character for the young scientist involved. And nobody wonders about the consequences of changing history. And this after the Back to the future flicks of the eighties. How responcible and intelligent is that? And on top of it all hormones are kicking in. So the cascade of epic failure starts combined with the arrogance of the main character who thinks he can do it all by himself, makes this a disappointed movie after all. Sometimes I wonder how stories develop in the mins of writers or do I give them to much credit to begin with? I think it's got to do something with my age and serious amount of viewing hours I spend in it. So if you have different expectations than me, this might be a good movie after all."
" Underrated film of the decade
",0.0,-0.5112,2020-09-18 00:00:00,10,I thought people are smart on IMDb these days but I was so wrong if this film could get 6.7 rating than any thing could go wrong this film is a masterpiece and that film has a better story than inception watching it in 2020 in my tab with my earphones on and I could still feel my heart trying to come uot of my chest It didn't even felt like I was watching a it felt like I was the one who was video taping the whole movie every actor in this movie is so convincable even the female leads in the films sorry to say but in many films the female actors are there just to show their their bodies but in this film every actor was just pure acting giving this movie a ten star and hoping others who would read this review will also give this movie a ten star my only regret is that this movie is a one time watch movie but one time is enough to absorb all the aspects of the movie
" Found Footage Film technique is Headache

" Just a silly amdram
",0.0258,-0.9521,2020-08-29 00:00:00,3,"Probably one of the worst ""found footage"" movies so far, in almost every video camera footage scene the question is blatant ""who's holding the camera, how is it pointed in the exact direction to document these scenes"" completely stupid, this would've been far better as just a movie, the video camera scenes are awful & ruin the flow of the story which at best is almost non existent,I'm not a fan of amdram but I do recognise its importance for the student actor, the whole ""react to act"" the idea that confrontation is the catalyst for the ""acting"", the staple of almost every cheap as chips TV soap, it's boring & repetitive with all the shouting & arguing & is used in this movie instead of acting to further the plot & tell the story, this is no doubt due to the awful script & halfassed silly time travel theory plot.
Apart from the odd scene that use some good special effects the $12million dollar budget looks to be largely waisted, with very little entertainment value & the bland unimaginative storyline/plot it's hard to see what the point of this movie was except from the most blatant basic plot that seems to run through every single teen movie from twilight to divergent, a boy wants to bed a girl, & that's it, sex, that is why most of these movies fall flat, that is why this movie falls flat, it isn't an adventure it isn't a time travel story it's simply a story about a boy wanting to bed a girl & those stories are two a penny, boring & flat."
" If only the main hero was smarter than he actually was.
",0.765,0.8338,2020-08-18 00:00:00,8,.nothing to add. But the idea about the time machine is cool but not for teenagers. What can they only do that is falling in love and that is all.
" A very thin exploration of the fun and dangers of time travel
",0.3134,-0.7579,2020-08-08 00:00:00,6,"Half way through this movie you realise there was no real reason it needed to be a found footage film. Without it, the film would function largely the same, as neither the worst not the best time travel movie.It's well made, and does a good job of depicting what kids this age would do if they could build a time machine. But when things start to go wrong, it just didn't feel very convincing."
" Story is 10 stars; camera work is 6 stars
",0.0,-0.69,2020-08-06 00:00:00,8,How do you ruin a good story? Make all the camera shots and angles frustratingly annoying! Fine to start the movie with the 'this is a home movie record of our experiment' but after 5 minutes they should have used 90% solid cinematography. An hour and 46 minutes of that crap camera work wears the patience thin.
" Smart kids acting stupid
",-0.1779,0.431,2020-07-30 00:00:00,2,"You create time travel and you use it to go to concerts and parties? How moronic.
This movie had a lot of potential but it devolved into a bunch of stupid acts by some kids who were too smart for their own good."
" Excellent time-travel story, with magnificently convincing acting
",0.8957,0.9707,2020-07-19 00:00:00,8,"After 230 reviews, perhaps everything that there is to say about the story (I thought it was excellent) or the found-footage format (unlike some reviewers I don't seem to have developed a deadly allergy to it yet) has been said.So I'll just comment on a different topic that I don't think has been getting much play: I thought that the entire cast's acting was absolutely magnificent. There was not ONE moment when I didn't feel like I was listening to a bunch of middle-class American suburban teenagers speaking spontaneously among themselves, and the male actors were utterly convincing as three guys who've been best friends since kindergarten.If there was one problem with the cast, it was in the casting choices regarding the two girls: Jessie, the beautiful object of the protagonist's love and every other boy in the high school's unbridled lust, and Christina, his sister who is probably a year or a bit more younger than him. The problem is that, to my eyes, the Christina actress, Virginia Gardner, was far more physically attractive than Sofia Black-D'Elia as Jessie. I think that Gardner should have had the Jessie role, with someone who appears a bit younger than her or Black-D'Elia as Christina."
" It's a movie about time machine.
",0.0,0.9565,2020-07-15 00:00:00,3,"As it's about a time machine so people with that kinda taste are gonna love it for sure or those people who have recently watched HG Wells based time machine they certainly love it but just from American school point of view as it's about school friendship and love , so it's a cliche."
" Too twisted
",0.0,-0.8171,2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"First an angle of cinematography was annoying but later I kind of liked it. Too long before actual time travel. Many stupid moments. You don't need to time travel to visit a concert. If you screwed up with a girl, just try again, obviously it was a chemistry from the first place, so just try again instead of time travel."

" Potential Ruined
",-0.4767,0.6848,2020-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Films that are made on a smart phone, this is so outdated. Also typically for an American film, the lead role of a 17 year old boy trying to get into college is played by an actor who is 27 at the time of filming. Why???"
" Substantially a good movie
",0.4927,0.6652,2019-12-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie is one of the movies that not only gives you that feeling of serenity that you get from watching a movie with a good adaptation of a book. It was coherent and easy to follow, there weren't any logical fallacies as far as i know, and it also gets you to think out of the box when it comes to concepts such as time travel and what are the possibilities of people having access to a machine that can potentially take you back in time and fix your past mistakes. I feel that the beginning of the film was unnecessarily long and it would've been better if they would have just cut to the chase, but overall it was a well time spent watching this movie."
" Another teen movie

As a sci-fi fan, I liked the story.

The picture has often wobbled, that was annoying.

" Better Than Expected

" An Appealing and Enticing Look at Time Paradoxes
",0.0,0.9319,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"12 September 2015. Cloverfield or Blair Witch Project? This pseudo-documentary style fictional sci fi thriller avoids its exploitative use in over-rated Cloverfield (2008) and retains most of the tone of authenticity of the horror classic movie The Blair Witch Project (1999). As a result Project Almanac even with its likely impossible consistent use of the hand-held video shots throughout the movie and the few loose ends involving the father and avoidance of the multitude of likely time paradoxes, the central core of the important elements of Project Almanac are presented so vividly and heart-felt that this movie maintains its essential integrity, vibrancy, and rapt appeal. It's important to remember that this movie involves the intelligent but impulsive minds of teenagers and that judging this movie from the standpoint of an adult would be to distort the viewpoint of how this movie is best appreciated. This is a vast improvement on the time travel genre, in a sincere and heart-felt way."
" I love the genre. I hated this movie.
",0.0,-0.1567,2018-11-25 00:00:00,5,"I love movies. I really love science fictions. I especially love time travel science fiction. I do not include movies like Superman, Somewhere in Time, or Planet of the Apes in time travel science fiction. They're . . .something else. I like movies like Predestination, Primer, The Time Machine, et al. I am willing to suspend my sense of disbelief to enjoy such movies. I can live with paradoxes. But I hate it when a movies does stupid things because its maker assumes the audience is ignorant, stupid or both. Project Almanac does that. A lot. The story is told in the form of a video diary but the method became boring and super unrealistic in short order. The time travel device was built by high school students. Fine. Many scientific breakthroughs have been made by the young. Project Almanac went to great lengths to reinforce the idea that the protagonists were young but devoted little time to display their genius. The long boring scenes of youthful exuberance should have been left on the editing room floor but the movie would have been short, very short. Project Almanac insulted my intelligence like many slaps in the face with a cold, wet, fish. Watch this film at your own peril but work a crossword puzzle or read a book while you do so. Don't waste the time you invest in Project Almanac."

Each time David tries to fix the problem he makes it worse.I found it hard to believe that one of David's even more geekier friend could not pass the chemistry test first time. Even more difficult to believe that they mess up with the lottery numbers so they do not win the top jackpot prize.If you are going to win lots of money why do you care about passing a high school test or getting some revenge on the local bully?Also these were clever people, before they time travelled they should had checked up on some do's and don't about time travel.The first part of the movie was frivolous and fun.

I spent most of the second half in awe of how bad filmmaking can get at its worst and what a completely f-ed up piece of crap this is. Bad script, wooden acting. It's an embarrassing mess of the time travel genre. It makes some of the Doctor Who dredge look quite good. If you have no brain or common sense, I would recommend this film to you to fill another one hour forty odd minutes of your empty life. If you have more than two brain cells, burn them to death by drinking pure ethanol rather than watch this."

The overall plot to the movie is ok and it's not the worst movie I've seen but it isn't the best either. I would recommend that you wouldn't watch this movie if you get motion sickness easily because the camera is very shaky. It was kind of cool how they made it look like Chris was filming the whole thing even though they used a movie camera. Overall pretty good movie.

So, a group of teens habitually travel back in time - as a group, to watch each others backs. And they do this a bit to habitually, and results become bad.Anyway, I am about 3 times the age of these teens - but I liked the romance angle, and this is why I score it so high.This is a pretty dark film, which is also why I give it a high score (that's me)."

I am still a bit disappointed by the shooting but... ok. On the other hand, the plot now seems to make some sense, and even a complain I read somewhere about ""they get a time machine and can't think of a better use""... becomes less critical.

Also this movie sticks by time travel laws and (although I haven't analysed the movie) I don't think there are any plot holes or if so not major plot holes.

" The film primer should have been
",0.0,-0.9224,2018-05-15 00:00:00,9,"To begin with I would add the slight negative; it seems to be a modern thing with films that the dialogue is slightly muffled or sounds like the actors are mumbling. However if you turn up the volume to quite high it is fine.
There has been reviews slating this film because of the errors about time travel; however when have we suddenly become experts on the subject when the subject matter Is theoretical and scientists argue the ins and out of it for a living. What I do like to say is this is fiction and films have something called ""artistic license"". Its equivalent of those people who moan about horror films when characters make silly decisions that end up getting them killed. if they made all these smart decisions that the viewers supposedly would do then they wouldn't end up being killed and there would be no story. The film is well acted the characters are likeable and it holds together well. I enjoyed the plot immensely it was tense and even a bit scary at times. It incorporated a lot of ideas and although not totally unique it still had you guessing as to where the plot was leading. At no point did I feel like there was noticeable plot holes or bad directing. A few people have compared this film to primer which apparently this is a poorer version of. I totally disagree you should definitely watch Almanac instead. Primer was one of the worst films I have ever seen and this is one of the best. I would give it 10 but the dialogue issue is a slight frustration remember to turn the volume down after watching or you will get blown away with what ever you watch next."
" Bland, forgettable and hokey, 'Project... wait, what did I watch, again?
",0.0,0.4899,2018-05-07 00:00:00,4,"'Project Almanac (2015)' is so utterly bland, not to mention ultimately forgettable, that you simply can't care about anything happening on-screen. It almost doesn't matter that the film relies so heavily on convention and breaks its own rules a number of times, mostly those relating to its overall presentation rather than its time-travel mechanics, that it becomes nothing more than a time-looped repeat of better films past... almost. There's nothing to draw you in here, not the hackneyed plot or hokey acting or humdrum presentation, and there's no real surprises to keep you interested once you are. You can totally check-out and still understand the purportedly 'complex' plot. 4/10"
" A shame about the protagonists
",-0.4767,-0.048,2018-05-01 00:00:00,5,"PROJECT ALMANAC is another teen-friendly time travel movie that feels much like THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, although not as interesting. The main problem with it is that the main characters are a group of hyperactive children who run around shouting and arguing a lot. When they finally figure out how to go back in time, they decide to cheat at school and go to a massive party, which seems very silly and superficial and a waste of a decent premise; compare this with the plot of the excellent Spanish thriller TIMECRIMES, for instance, to see where I'm coming from. Indeed, PROJECT ALMANAC only gets good in the last half an hour or so, when the stakes are raised and the film manages to build suspense quite effectively. This is also a found footage movie that seems to go out of the way to feature as much camera shake as possible; it's not something I have a particular problem with, but your mileage may vary."
" Good Action, But Science Was Off
",0.2382,-0.1655,2018-04-04 00:00:00,7,"Overall, this was a pretty good movie. The plot was a little predictable (ironic) and there were several continuity and logical errors made. The biggest was simply the time travel concept. Changing the past for one person changes the future for everyone on the planet immediately. Instead, it took a few trips for the effects to be made evident. On the flip side, a good bit of the science was good and correct. Seeing one's self in the future from the past (entropic cascade failure), you being the only one(s) to remember past events that now never happen, etc. This was all theoretically correct. But their problem with finding hydrogen? That is a simple science. Water and electricity. Considering the amount of power going into that device, some of it could easily have been siphoned off for hydrogen generation. Oh well. Also- the instances with the camera. If he went back in time to destroy the time machine, then by the rules of causality he would disappear along with the camera and time machine (the movie only did the character and time machine). Somehow, the camera stayed there for who knows how long until the tape expired. Then, it presumably kept running until the battery went dead. The fact that he was able to turn it on in the future and the ""original"" from that timeline suggest this line of events essentially is repeating itself over and over. Based on this prospect, it could be assumed that the entire universe/their entire reality is stuck at this point in time and never moving forward- only going back on itself multiplying the number of times this kid recorded the series of events and then going back in time again to destroy the equipment all while leaving the camera recording and waiting for the next future self to turn it on, watch it, and repeat the series of events again in an infinite loop. Wow. That was a huge rant there, but enough said about that. Anyway, good movie for the action, but it could have been better on fixing the continuity and logical mistakes."

",0.0772,-0.992,2018-02-03 00:00:00,1,"This is a movie so stupid that I felt personally offended while watching it. The depth of stupidity in pretty much every line of dialogue and every scene in the movie is remarkable. I don't understand how anyone can make a movie like this by accident, I refuse to believe it, so I think it was made this badly on purpose, it's basically a trolling movie. Why do I think that? Well, if one is so incredibly incompetent and untalented to only be able to come up with a movie this bad, it's reasonable to assume they would not be in a position to make a movie in the first place. However, somehow, these people got the opportunity. I know many movies are made with zero care about the substance and their sole purpose is to make money. I understand that. But those are usually lighthearted comedies or mindless highschool dramas. When a movie is SO DAMN up it's own a** and tries to present itself as a movie about a highly intellectual topic, but at the same time is incredibly stupid on every single level, then I don't understand it. This is a movie that made me feel like the people who filmed it were trolling me, like they were laughing and pointing fingers at me because I was naive enough to keep watching the crap they came up with. They make these teenagers talk and behave in such a way that it makes them seem so deeply dumb that I would be impressed if any of them could replace a lightbulb, yet they solve one of the most complex problems in existence, while not even paying that much attention to it. Everything that happens in between is just horribly badly thought out and shows that the filmmakers imagined the viewers would have IQ's around 60 and absolutely no understanding or knowledge of anything around them. That's the only way you can watch this garbage and not feel offended or not understand what's so wrong with it. I'm afraid to imagine how dumb one has to be to actually enjoy watching this, but ok...It's an insult to intelligence, insult to common sense, insult to science and to the movie industry."

Shia LaBeouf's nerd character inexplicably gets with Megan Fox's over-sexualised mega-babe character. Its just that again with a younger nerd + babe - because these films are produced by 'dudes' who have to throw in the creepy scenes where they zoom in on the girls' tits, asses and legs and we all have to leer along with them because its just dudes being dudes - even when they're nerds. After the first third of the film replays Transformers for us, we are then treated to the second act of overlong experiment scenes and super-cool time travel experiences which go to the trouble of highlighting every issue they could think of with time travel, and then go and create some inexplicable paradoxes (how does he go back to the wall to kiss her when his past self is already there? why when they replay the classroom test scene do they not run into X amount of their past selves, also trying to replay this moment?) Then finally we get the third act, which can pretty much be summed up in three words that never needed to be the blueprint for anything - The Butterfly Effect. Somehow every combination of effects they have on the past directly effect their present in a negative way - shock horror. The film limps to a predictable end by tying up the mystery of the key ring that had everyone on the edge of their seats for all of 3 seconds. By this point you will be exhausted by all the questions this film raises and will just be glad its over, not caring that none of it makes sense."

He bashed this movie because he felt that technically it wasn't up to his level of academic standards. First off they didn't make this movie so that the Engineers in the world could take notes and use them in their jobs. This was a typical teen movie which kept your interest and had a decent ending. If you wanted an educational movie than maybe look into watching the education channel or maybe even the Sci-Fi channel. Why would you be watching a teen movie to compare your knowledge with what they portrayed in the movie.The movie is worth watching especially if you have teenagers. I have two that I watched the movie with an 18 year old and a 15 year old and they both enjoyed it. We were not going into watching this movie to learn how to time travel, and or build instruments.

" This movie had 2 things I can't stand: time travel and shaky camera filming.
",-0.2263,0.9489,2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,"Right off the bat this movie has two strikes against it. First, I can't stand found footage films. This technique is used to make things seem more ""real,"" but it just makes it hard to watch. If I'm watching a move with any kind of sci-fi, paranormal activity or supernatural elements, I suspend reality and enjoy the movie. If a movie says that a being torments and kills people by getting at them through their dreams, I accept those terms for the movie and that's the end of it. If I don't suspend reality, the concept is outrageous whether the film is from a shaky camera or neatly edited by a post-production staff. The second element I can't stand is time travel whether it's in a comical movie like ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" (2010), a serious plot such as ""The Terminator"" (1984), or even in the form of blatant science like the Stephen Hawkins documentary ""A Brief History of Time"" (1991). Time travel means infinitesimal points exist of which traveling to can alter the entire path in that existence therefore there are infinite realities, and an infinite copy of every atom in the universe (therefore every person). If that statement confused youÂGOOD! In this movie, an intelligent high school senior finds a time machine created by his father who passed away when he was 7. He and his friends get it to work, with the limitation that they can only travel to the recent past. They begin to see how their actions largely affect the present (now which present?) like in ""The Butterfly Effect"" (2004). The concept that small changes can radiate into larger, even catastrophic changes IS an interesting philosophical concept, and was the saving factor of this movie in the movie, memories are altered as they travel back. What determines which time travel's alterations stick? The most recent? But what is recent when you're traveling through time? And why with the time travel, memories get altered, but one thing that never changes is the video being recorded?"

Ummm well it starts off okay I suppose but then the characters just are the most forgettable stereotypical teens you could find in a teen flick and to top it off kind of hard to like. I mean seriously the idea seems okay on paper but then you find ""not so spoiler alert"" that they find a time machine with instructions on how to make in their basement so what do these jackasses go and do? They go rob the school of some hydrogen like juvenile delinquents and go grab a random ass Xbox 360 and take it's batteries and it's just cringe from there.By the way it's no wonder to me why the ""leader"" only got a partial scholarship to MIT, because no one with common sense would do even remotely close to any of the stupid things the main character did. Then it has the stereotypical ""get the girl crush"" thing that feels outdated as the camera style it is using and after they finally go back in time to ""yesterday"" I just could not take anymore of the fecal matter that is this movie. The characters are annoying and lack any real depth and seem like poor copy and pasted characters from other better films at best, the premise feels worked to death, the camera work is just awful,and the plot as a whole is paper thin if you want to call it a a plot ""Like oohh I found my dad's instructions in how to make a time machine in my parents basement Derp, rather than do something semi-intelligent with it I'll use it to get girls like Brian Griffin from Family Guy"". I could almost forgive all that if the movie wasn't taking itself seriously like in the case of Sharknado for example , but it's instead actually trying to cast itself as an intelligent film and that's my biggest problem with it ultimately is it's just comes off as dumb as a bag of hammers.Maybe found footage films are just not for me or something but with the exception of Cloverfield and even it wasn't a perfect film by any means, I've yet to really find any found footage film I've liked. Overall it is nothing but a silly but terribly obnoxious mess of a film and I highly recommend burying it somewhere in the desert."

I say it is incoherent because the development of the characters get wrong at some point. Their reactions, their way of confront the problems â they look like a cheap excuse to tell the story. The changes the time travel makes are incoherent too. I understand that if you change some little details, it's possible to change big things.

" Teens And Time Travel
",0.0,0.9914,2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"When I first heard of the concept for ""Project Almanac"", I was fascinated by the idea of a ""teenage time-travel"" flick. Sadly, while the film was supposed to be released in the early summer of 2014, I believe, it got pushed all the way back to early 2015. Thus, it just recently opened to not very much fanfare. Fortunately, though, the film is very entertaining (especially for a young audience) and will have you both laughing and thinking (and even feeling a little bit) at different times throughout.For a basic plot summary, ""Project Almanac"" focuses on David (Jonny Weston), an extremely tech-savvy high school student who has just gotten accepted into MIT. While poking around up in the attic looking for ideas for scholarship projects, David finds an old video camera that once belonged to his now-deceased scientist father. On the tape is young David at his 7th birthday party...as well as current David lurking in the background seemingly unnoticed! After informing his friends Quinn (Sam Lerner) and Adam (Allen Evangelista), as well as sister Christina (Virginia Gardner), about this 'impossibility"", a little basement research discovers that David's deceased father had left plans to build a ""temporal displacement device""...or time machine. With the help of friend (and potential love interest) Jessie (Sofia Black-D'Elia), they set to work at trying to make the device operational.What makes ""Project Almanac"" so entertaining is that it takes a concept that could be so clichÃ©d (""teenagers find a time machine and screw around with it"") and makes it very watchable by appealing to a number of different sensibilities. I think that the movie will probably appeal most to teenagers or young adults themselves, as director Dean Israelite really knows how to accurately portray the teenage years. All the dialogue and actions up on the screen feel like they could be things said/done by real teenagers.The movie will also attract sci-fi fans because of the time travel aspect, which is done with just enough serious to give it credence. I mean, there is a scene with a chalkboard explaining things (a staple of any time travel movie worth its salt), proof positive that this film's creators knew what they were doing in creating time-travel fiction. There are a lot of ""winks and nods"" to previous time-travel stories in this one, and you can just tell that the creators of the script knew how to do time-travel right.Of course, this isn't a perfect movie by any means. Granted, I don't know what exactly pushed it back so far, but it is the type of movie that gets lost in itself a few times. The setup is fantastic (probably the best part of the whole experience), the ending is fine, but there are a few times in the middle where it stretches its boundaries a little too much.Overall, though, ""Project Almanac"" is a wildly entertaining film that combines the weighty topic of time-travel with the youthful effervescence of current teen culture...not an easy feat!"
