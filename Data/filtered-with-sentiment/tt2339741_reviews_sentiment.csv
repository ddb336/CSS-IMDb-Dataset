" Worth watching, but don't expect a lot
",0.1154,0.9002,2021-03-18 00:00:00,5,"Outstanding mood, props, scenery, decor, and the music and acting is really good (as far as a non-professional such as myself can tell). But, the story doesn't seem that good, or at least not explained that well. Then again, I don't need a great story in a horror film, that would be a bonus for me. It's just not that scary. Don't expect a really good movie, but it's worth seeing."
" Not Scary
",0.3875,0.3369,2021-03-06 00:00:00,1,"I just paused this movie to see how far in I am, and it is just over 53 minutes and nothing scary has happened yet. At all. In fact, nothing at all has really happened. The real disappointment here is that the production designer is clearly talented, as the movie looks like a Merchant Ivory film that takes place in the 1940s. The costumes, hair and sets are gorgeous and spot on, but there's just nothing to the story. It's always heartbreaking to see so much good, hard work go into a movie that ultimately has no substance."
" A still haunting horror sequel
",-0.7003,-0.6607,2021-02-17 00:00:00,6,"The sequel to the most haunting piece of British Film ever made is not as haunting as its superior previous film. This has a great setting for the Second World War but cuts short on scare factor with many scenes not being as scary as they can be. This films scares show strongly in the films finale which is intense, scary and upsetting."
" Spoiler alert, it's a horrendous piece of trash
",-0.3818,-0.7969,2021-02-15 00:00:00,2,"I actually enjoyed the first one but that isn't even in the same league as the first. It made no sense, the acting was woeful and it was so so so boring. Don't waste your time with it."
" Dont waste your time.
",0.3252,0.0,2021-02-13 00:00:00,2,"Watched for 40 mins, and absolutely nothing happened. Finally turned it off."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9709,2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"The film was very interesting and true to the times. The scares were that of a classic horror movie with other interesting ones added in. The main protagonists were identified nicely with a good backstory. I really enjoyed the storyline despite previous reviews about the lighting I thought it worked well making the movie even more spooky and gothic. Turning the lights off to see the dark parts just made the atmosphere even better.
The woman in black: Angel of death, was positively spooky and interesting in every way and definitely embodied what I would want from this movie!!!"
" Tears and fears, diddle diddle!
",-0.6114,-0.9926,2020-09-13 00:00:00,6,"The original story is completely shifted from a long time ago (around 1901) to 1941, London, during the Blitz. Orphaned children are moved out of the city to the countryside, and some nice local person in the village of the infamous Eel Marsh House must have thought that it was peaceful enough, vast enough, and abandoned enough to be overlooked by the Germans and their planes. Good intention bad idea. That person greets them when they arrive at the closest station. He must be some doctor of some type and we will meet absolutely no other local inhabitant.At once everything goes wrong because despite what some might have thought that 40 years earlier the sacrifice of Arthur Kipps and Joseph Kipps was not enough to get the woman in black back to her grave. How immensely wrong were they! This time, the house is haunted by indistinct living dead, probably all children, but not sure, all the children that were killed or kidnapped to death in the previous episode forty years before and in the following decades.And of course, the children start disappearing. But one has a special relationship with the house. Edward seems to know why they are here, and it was not only evacuation from London. It was some dark plan from some somber forces to bring them here to be the flesh-and-bone-fodder of ghosts. But Edward knows and he is able to let the others know particularly Eve, his teacher who is able, with the help of a failed RAF pilot demoted to being the general manager of a close-by fake airfield that serves as a decoy for the Germans to waste their bombs on fake planes made of plywood and cardboard, who was I saying, is able to see beyond the insecurity and the dark mystery, and thus to save the surviving children.They managed to escape with the RAF pilot and in his jeep, and they found refuge in his underground shelter. And it ends the way it started, in confusion. This extension or sequel of the first good film is disappointing and sad. But of course, the film was cheap since the mansion was already there with all the furniture and decoration. A couple or a triad of cardboard and plywood planes was not exactly e monumental investment. You can forget about this one because you will certainly not get scared at all. Maybe puzzled, at most. It's like a comedy hour in the midst of Hell when all the little and big devils have gone to some temple to pray for the apocalypse and the end of the world.Have a snack and toilet pause instead, before entering more dangerous grounds.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
" Boring and pointless
",-0.3182,-0.5096,2020-09-12 00:00:00,2,I find this film very dull. Bad and derivative script with lot of cheap jump scares but not scary at all. It is interesting that many reviewers compare it with the film from 2012 (directed by J Watkins) but hardly anybody mentions version from 1989 (directed by Herbert Wise) one of the best and scariest horrors ever-cult classic. It is the only one of the 3 that managed to create creepy atmosphere in which both following films failed miserably.
" Not worthy...
",0.0,-0.5418,2020-07-27 00:00:00,2,"This film dragged on to long. 70% off it I couldnt make out what was actually happening as the screen was so dark. There was no point in having the boyfriend pilot, or the airspace in the film at all. There was so much missed opportunity. The bits that were to build suppence took to long and the jump wasn't worth it. Feel like the story line wasn't that good. Now I've seen this film I wouldn't recommend it and i wouldn't watch it again."
" The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death
",-0.5994,-0.9985,2020-07-04 00:00:00,3,"The original Hammer Horror movie starring Daniel Radcliffe was a big success, I'd been meaning to watch the sequel for some time, I had a feeling it wasn't going to quite as good, but I was prepared to see where it would go next. Basically, set thirty years after the previous events, during the Second World War, and the time of the London Blitz. School headmistress Jean Hogg (Helen McCrory) and young teacher Eve Parkins (Phoebe Fox) are joining a group of school children as they are being evacuated to the isolated market town of Crythin Gifford. On the train journey there, Eve meets dashing RAF pilot Harry Burnstow (Jeremy Irvine), who is stationed at an airfield near the town. Although Eve and Jean do not approve of staying in Eel Marsh House, the isolated manor house on an island in the marshes, there is no alternative. It isn't long before Eve starts to sense that this house is not what it appears to be. One of the children, Edward (Oaklee Pendergast), who has been mute since the death of his parents in the bombing, acts particularly strangely, constantly carrying a rotting doll. The two teachers and children soon start hearing strange noises and then see things lurking in the night, including the spirit of a Woman in Black (Leanne Best). Eve sees the Woman in Black in the graveyard surrounding the house, and trying to chase her, stumbles into the gravestone of Nathaniel Drablow, and is disturbed having visions of this man's death. Eve is reunited with Harry when he shows up at the house, and they discover the truth of the Woman in Black listening to an old recording. The spirit is haunting them because of the premature death of Nathaniel, and in particular Eve, because years ago she gave up a baby. Eve journeys into the abandoned town to confront Jacob (Ned Dennehy), a raving madman they encountered upon arriving, but may be able to help them. He is blind, and therefore unable to see the ghost or be killed by her, but he was driven insane by the deaths of many children, whose ghosts surround him, and tries to kill Eve before she escapes. Many of the children are terrorised further, and there a couple of deaths at the hands of the evil spirit. Realising that the Woman in Black wants her alone, Eve tries to confront her on the marshes. She and one of the children are almost dragged down into the water, but Harry arrives and saves them, though he is dragged down to his death instead, and the terror appears to be over. Months later, Eve has adopted Edward, and they are living in London. Although they believe they are free from the ghost, once they leave their house, she appears again and smashes a picture of Harry and his crew. Also starring Harry Potter's Adrian Rawlins as Dr. Rhodes, Jude Wright as Tom, Amelia Pidgeon as Joyce, Casper Allpress as Fraser, Amelia Crouch as Flora, Leilah de Meza as Ruby, Pip Pearce as James, and Alfie Simmons as Alfie. Fox is reasonable as the leading victim trying save herself and the children, McCrory is also alright as the headmistress, the biggest problem with this sequel is that there are not enough attempts to be genuinely scary, the so-called jump scares do not, the atmosphere is nowhere near as tense as before, and I'll be honest, I found the majority of it boring and uneventful, a disappointing supernatural horror. Adequate!"
" Movie in Black
",0.0,0.1092,2020-06-25 00:00:00,3,People interested to watch this movie should be instructed to use night vision glasses to see through the this dark movie. Its toooooo dark. Sometimes you really need to think that you need to focus on story or lit some lights inside your TV screen.Story is a total mess. Normally that movie that dont do well in part 1 learn lesson and come up with better in part 2. But this is not the case here. So just leave it if you have another option to watch.
" Dark movie. Literally.
",0.0,-0.8381,2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"From what I could see of the movie during the daylight/exterior sequences, the movie was good.. reasonable scare story, well acted, authentic period continuity etc. The problem with this movie is it is so poorly lit that at times you have to guess what's going on. Seriously, the screen goes black. I don't know if it was a budgetary issue or just a terrible post production issue but it ruined the viewer experience for me."
" Zzz
",-0.296,-0.9809,2020-06-20 00:00:00,3,"This is a jump scare wrapped in bad script, wrapped in bad acting, wrapped in a jump scare, wrapped in a bunch of filler. What's the story? I don't know.. Whatched the whole thing and I have no idea. The characters are boring, one dimensional and forgettable. The jump scares aren't even slightly scary. Did I mention awful acting? Bad. Just bad!"
" Boring,sad and bits of jump scare towards the end.
",-0.4939,-0.7941,2020-06-13 00:00:00,5,I haven't seen part one so I wont be able to link any connection. But this movie by itself is just sad not terrifying or frightening. Yea there are bits of jump scare towards the end and that was all that it has to offer as a horror movie.
" Genuinely frightening, moving and authentic period horror
",-0.7845,0.9605,2020-04-25 00:00:00,9,"I couldn't get over how much effort had gone into this production. It really does transport you back to 1940s England. Magnificent casting and performances by all, with a great script. Yes, contrary to other reviewers, and even if you have seen the previous movie, Woman In Black 2 is genuinely frightening, particularly the second half. And it ends well, which the first movie didn't. It's better than the first movie, in my opinion, and scarier. It's not all in a terrible house either, so movie claustrophobia isn't a problem, though what terrible house there is is definitely a chill. All aspects of the production were top class. I docked it a point for its slightly unbelievable premise, that a dozen very small children would be sent to live in a totally isolated, and at times unreachable, decaying and dangerous mansion, without even a telephone or boat or an assigned male guardian, and even told they should be grateful for that, as beyond my logics. Surely 1940 wasn't as brutal (or stupid) as that?"
" Pointless sequel from the American cash-cow machine
",0.0,0.7259,2020-04-06 00:00:00,4,"The Woman in Black 2 starts off in London in Nineteen forty-one (forty years after the original film) inside a bomb shelter. Air raid sirens are ringing out and there is general unease and nervousness. Miss Parkins (Phoebe Fox) steps out into the streets of London and sees the devastation before her. Before much longer, Miss Parkins and Jean Hogg (a wasted McCrory) are boarding a train heading north with evacuee children. One such child is Edward, who has just been orphaned. Their destination? Cryphin Gifford, or more specifically Eel Marsh House.On the train Miss Parkins meets Harry (Irvine) who is also traveling to the same destination. Once at Cryphin Gifford they board a bus to get through the village and on to the mansion. Just outside the village they suffer a puncture. Miss Parkins decides to look around (why?) this now abandoned and desolate village, but it would seem that maybe this ruined village is not completely uninhabited. Once at Eel Marsh House, while being shown around, one particular door is open that shouldn't be. That night after a bad dream, Miss Parkins head to the basement where she glimpses something...or someone.Now I wasn't that impressed with the original film, only giving it a six, but there were certainly many positives to it. All the positives the original had, this film is missing. While The Woman in Black 2 is reasonably acted for the most part, there are no stand out performances. As for Helen McCrory, how do you go from Harry Potter and James Bond to this rubbish, surely she can't be that desperate for the work? But the quality of the acting (which isn't marvelous) is definitely the highlight of this piece of dressed up dross.The script is truly awful and how the cast managed their lines I'll never know. Many people have complained about the lighting here but I personally didn't find too much fault with it. I think the film was supposed to be dark, but will admit that they perhaps went a little overboard with this. When it's black, it really is black and it is a struggle to make anything out on the screen. Add in very lame jump scares (which you can see coming), no real plot which is also incredibly predictable and the incredibly slow pace of the film, you can see the cheap intention. Even any special effects are down to a minimum.You know, it's at times like these that I actually feel incredibly sorrowful regarding what happened to Hammer Films and the influence they had on many people. After being dead in the water for close on fifteen years, they were bought by an investment consortium, which only seven short years later they sold on to a another consortium. The original buyers never did anything with the brand name, where as at least the new owners are making films. Given the quality of those films, it's hard to say who the better owners really were.Almost enough to make you a shed a tear sometimes and pray for that big lottery win so that she could be owned by someone who cares about the name and history, and isn't just after a quick and easy buck. While Hammer films were never terribly glitzy, or well made, or had the best scripts or even production values, they did had two key ingredients. Class actors and style. None of the recent offerings from the new company (won't dignify the new owners with stating it as the same company) have either except for one notable exception.Not having style or solid dependable actors as well as none of the aforementioned does not instill confidence in the quality of their productions. Sad days indeed for a former powerhouse of the industry. After such useless offerings as the Let Me In remake and The Quiet Ones, The Woman in Black 2 is no better and possibly their worst film yet. It is a cheap lazy cash-grab which tries to ride the coat-tails of the moderately successful original. The likes of Cushing and Lee must be turning in their graves.

" What a bad movie..
",-0.5423,-0.25,2020-03-22 00:00:00,2,This movie forced me to write this review after along long time as I took revenge on this movie for wasting my Sunday time.. Please do something better than watching this movie. you better watch paint dry..
" Not the best sequel
",-0.5216,0.7469,2020-02-20 00:00:00,5,But I only loved the airport part I don't really even know why
" The Woman in Black is unfortunately back!
",-0.4003,-0.998,2020-02-01 00:00:00,5,"The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death is a precise example of a modern Horror movie sequel; more jumpscares, even more stupid characters and consistent boredom. Here is my review of this divisive sequel.
The Good
The PerformancesOne of Angel of Death's biggest positives is its performances from its lead cast. Phoebe Fox portrays the main character of this film Eve Parkin, a teacher who has a past in that she needed to give up her baby when she was younger which ties directly to the past of Jennet Humfrye. Phoebe manages to portray the state of the character flawlessly and gives a soothing and consistent vibe to it. Jeremy Irvine portrays Harry Bunstow, a flying officer who was disallowed to fly anymore after a crash, and he also magnficently portrays this character in style as a romantic piece to Eve. Helen McCrory is very good in this film and Oaklee Pendergast portrays the central kid Edward perfectly.The SettingI will say one thing about both this film and its predecessor, the setting of both of these films is incredibly creepy and disturbing. Eel Marsh House is easily one of the creepiest and greatest horror movie settings in recent years. Whenever i see this rotten and big house, it sends a chilling feeling throughout my body. The setting around the house is also extremely creepy; with a graveyard and a bog in which a kid and a man drowned in.The SoundtrackThis movie has a distinct and creepy soundtrack that really fits the theme of this movie.It actually has good pacingThis movie, despite a poorly written and conceived story, has a solid pacing that feels like it's going forward. The movie's runtime at 98 minutes is warranted, and the pacing is for the most part good enough.Some scary momentsDespite an over-reliance on jumpscares, this film still has some moments that is fittingly creepy and makes you feel uncomfortable. Most of this is due to the overall setting but also the soundtrack and the athmosphere that gives this movie a creepy look to it. It is however far from being on the same level of creepiness as its predecessor.The Bad
The Purpose of Jennet HumfryeThe titular villain of these two films is a very weird villain when it comes to the overall purpose of her existence. Her backstory was also given in the first one, but it's also fleshed out even more in this movie. It is revealed that Jennet Humfrye was the birth mother to Nathaniel Drablow, but because of her unstable nature she was deemed unfit to take care of him and so her sister Alice Drablow would take care of him as her ""son"". One day, a horse and a carriage carrying Nathaniel, Charles (father) and Alice crashed in the marsh which killed both Charles and Nathaniel. Jennet who had witnessed this from the house itself was distraught by this incident and after writing some angry letters she hung herself in the house's nursery. It is said that whoever sees her will trigger a child in killing itself. In this film, she is also resposible for killing many children. Now it is said that she does this to take revenge on her own son's death, but overall it is a very weak motive to slaughter kids because of the fact that your own died.Over-reliance on cheap jumpscaresOne of this movie's biggest sins is its over-reliance on jumpscares. I would have been okay with jumpscares if it had something to do with the overall creepiness of the film but it's stupid jumpscares that only exists to make you jump in the seat and nothing beyond that. Plus, there are way too many of them, like seriously too many.Thinly written plotThe plot of this movie is that two teachers and a group of children, alongside a former flying officer escapes the Blitz in London to evacuate to Eel Marsh house, in doing so waking up the evil that rests there. The plot is wildly uninteresting, has really no surprises to it and is dastardly unorginal. The final act of the film has some emotion going through it, but it's extremely undercut by a cheap jumpscare at the end which ruined everything this stood for. Lazy writting x4.Exposition heavyThis movie is filled with unneeded exposition that doesn't do anything than to add fillar into the movie. There are some scenes that are kinda necessary to tell but they could have been told in a another way.You don't care about any of the charactersYet another awful part about this film is that you don't care about any of the characters in this film because none of them are given a great enough development and background to make you care for what they are doing. Plus they are all in reality incredibly stupid.The LightingThis movie has some creepy scenes, but it's hard to see them when the horrendous lighting makes it so that it is impossible to see anything that is going on. Massive fail here!Overall WIB 2: Angel of Death is a movie that has its few positives in some good performances, creepy setting and some scary moments but all of that is undercut by poor lighting, over-reliance on jumpscares and stupid characters with no motivation. Plus this was super unnecessary!"
" Not Best nor Better either
",-0.3243,-0.6584,2019-12-26 00:00:00,4,"The trailer was scary. That is it.The beginning was good as it takes us to an old English war zone. Then what? Nothing.The movie is full of thrilling music yet saw the ghost's face only once. The whole movie is darker than it supposed to. The scenes are not clear. Feel pity for the crew. They act well without a proper story, and with no lights as well.Expected to the sequel to be better but highly disappointed."
" I do not like it

",-0.5994,-0.9797,2019-12-01 00:00:00,2,"This loose sequel is set 40 years after the original film. Eve Parkins (Phoebe Fox) a schoolteacher, her young students and the headmistress Jean Hogg (Helen McCrory) are evacuated from London during the Blitz.They are sent to isolated Eel Marsh House, where the events of the first film took place. One lad Edward who has been mute since his parents were killed in the bombing is cruelly bullied by several children. One of them ends up being dead, the boy being drawn out of the house by the vengeful woman in black.Eve is protective of Edward and there is a dashing airman station nearby the mansion.It is a spooky gothic film with a funeral theme. The trouble is I could not see a thing. The budget must have been so low, the cinematographer could not even buy a wind up torch to light the film. A large portion of the film seems to consist of a dark screen."
" Should have left it alone
",-0.25,-0.891,2019-09-17 00:00:00,1,"This was another tale of a sequel gone wrong. Bad plot, horrible story telling, bad acting. Not to mention a lot of the situations made no sense at all. Should have left the 1st movie as is. To be honest I'm surprised they even let this movie release."
" Too cliche, not as scary and creepy as the first one.
",0.3875,0.4075,2019-07-04 00:00:00,3,Too cliche. Boring in some parts and not that scary at all. First one is waay much better. I only recommend it if you are fan of watching all kinds of terror/ horror movies regardless if they are good or bad.
" Like watching a movie in the theater but someone forgot to turn the projector on
",0.1901,0.2066,2019-06-29 00:00:00,4,"The audience will ask if they need glasses or go to their eye doctor. As someone else said, about 70-80% of the movie isn't visible. There is no plot either so even if you can't see anything, there isn't anything. Isn't much of a horror film, we barely see any ghost (is there?). Plot doesn't make sense since why take the wrong person (at the end?). Only redemption is acting is fairly good. Ah, one wishes for the old Hammer films. If this is a new Hammer horror flick, it isn't fun anymore."
" Much weaker than the first film.
",-0.4404,-0.9952,2019-05-03 00:00:00,2,"This film is the sequel to another, which was a success and which, in turn, was the remake of a TV movie of the 80's. This time, the house of the swamp is occupied by a group of children from London , in the middle of World War II, in order to protect themselves from the German bombings. They are accompanied by a small group of adults where Eve fits, a young woman with a mysterious past who soon realizes the horror that inhabits that house. It is up to her to protect the children from the dark entity that wants them dead.Personally, I find this film considerably weaker than the first. The script is very simple and underdeveloped. We never really feel the danger of war, and all the action separates from the context of the time, only managing to take advantage of the environment, the scenarios. The war was only a pretext to fill the haunted house of children, coming from nothing, easy prey of the murderous creature that lives there. The characters were also thought of in the worst way. Too cliché, we have an aviator traumatized and frustrated with himself, a loving young woman who is pursued by a complicated past and a skeptical elderly, who only believes in supernatural phenomena when they literally jump in front of her face. The scares are basic, the film fails to create a tense and disturbing environment.Technically, the film clearly displays its low budget: all scenarios are basic, with the main house being emptied of all the decadent and exquisite scenery of the first film. Cinematography is overly dark and this makes the film very boring. There are some details of the film that, too, I misunderstood, such as the emptying of the neighboring village to the marsh house. Did they all die? Was it the creature that killed them? Are they gone? What happened?This movie is bad and can not scare you. It's not a movie that I believe you can see more than once."
" Interesting reinterpretation but not particularly tense
",0.576,-0.9039,2019-03-24 00:00:00,6,"As its title hints, The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death utilizes the same aesthetic, sets, and basic premise of the previous film to a slightly different end. Instead of an unappeasable force of murderous chaos, the title character becomes an instrument of godlike judgment, punishment, and, potentially, redemption. For the most part, this surprisingly solid sequel consistently maintains its predecessor's gloomy mood, but, perhaps in part because of its new thematic emphasis, it lacks the tightness, tension, and terror of the original."
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.8499,2019-03-02 00:00:00,1,"Way to boring.
I would skip this film.
The characters are very forgetful.

Having the haunted house of the 1800's now inhabited by an orphanage trying to escape the ravages of WWII. But that's as far as it goes. So much could have been done with this idea, but now it's ruined and wasted on this barely discernable mess. The poor actors wasted their skill on this one. Give it a pass."

" Creepy and eerie sequel in which a gloomy ghost seeks revenge against children
",-0.8316,-0.9905,2018-09-17 00:00:00,6,"While the first installment dealt with a young solicitor- Daniel Radcliffe- travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals . Here happens 40 years after the first haunting at Eel Marsh House, as a group of children under the care of two women (a rigid and strict Helen McGlory, as well as a warm and loving Phoebe Fox) are evacuated from WWII London . They arrive in the haunted house, awakening the house's darkest inhabitant at the isolated manor and soon learn a dark secret , as they find that Eel Marsh House is haunted by the vengeful ghost , referred to here as an angel of death. As they become the next target for the ghost of Jennette Humfrye, otherwise known woman dressed in black. With the help of a fellow soldier (Jeremy Irvine) , two women and some unfortunate children must fend off the damned spirit who takes the scared kiddies .She never forgives. She never forgets. She never left. The pace is slow but I never found it dull, the plot is similar to first outing , as new visitors escaping from war-torn London discover that the house is haunted by the revengeful ghost of a woman dressed in black whose son was drowned in a bog and whenever she appears, a child from the group dies. As the scary story narrates the legends of the manor and reveals more untold secrets and another chapter of evil tricks & truths of the menacing Jeanette. Cast is acceptable such as : Phoebe Fox plays a young girl with a dark past that haunts her , as she learns that the woman lost her son drowned in the marsh and she seeks revenge, taking the children . Helen McGlory plays a stiff-upper-lip caretaker with disagreeable manners . And Jeremy Irvine as a handsome pilot to help investigate what is happening. In addition , Adrian Rawlins, who plays Dr. Rhodes, played Arthur Kidd , the main character, in the TV movie version of Woman in black (1989). The location used for the fictional story leading to Eel Marsh Island is Osea Island's tidal causeway situated at the estuary of Blackwater River in Essex, England, United Kingdom. Due to tidal conditions, the cast and crew were restricted to only 4 hours of working time per day at that location.

",0.0,-0.8551,2018-07-05 00:00:00,4,"The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death somewhat improves the story of the previous entry but not by much. Taking place during the second world war in Britain, we have another protagonist ensconced in a remote locale haunted by some ghostly figure. Atmosphere is quickly displaced by the usual 'loud noise/what was that?' paradigm which are the stock and trade of most banal shockfests, which is a shame considering the time period of the film lends itself to the genre handsomely. Oh dear!"

",0.0,-0.6243,2018-06-20 00:00:00,6,"Whilst not being as good as the first Woman In Black film, it wasn't too bad overall. The tension was well built and the scares weren't too bad. The only thing that put me off was some of the cheesy acting. But, I've seen much worse!"
" The Woman In Black: Angel of Death is the perfect tame remedy for insomnia.
",-0.0516,-0.9969,2018-05-22 00:00:00,3,"First time I watched this, I fell asleep. Thought to purchase it to give it another go and guess what? I fell asleep. There is something about this dull monotonous horror sequel that just puts me in a state of fatigue. I have no idea why. England is in the midst of a war, and a group of children take shelter at Eel Marsh House where the ghostly titular ""Woman In Black"" resides. This sequel means well. It's clear that the production values, eerie atmosphere and decent direction from Harper amount to what should've been a mildly scary horror film. But alas here we are, the first weekend of 2015 and the curse for atrocious horror films continues. The acting was wasted. You obtain the star quality of Irvine and McCrory and do nothing with them, all the attention is on Fox who unfortunately suffers from ""Scared but Stupid Syndrome"". Y'know what I mean. Going down to a creepy dark basement shouting ""hello, is there anyone there?"" whilst looking unfazed by the whole situation or actively pursuing a malicious spectral entity instead of actually putting her foot down and persuading her colleague to leave. It's predictably clichéd. Littered with jump scares that aren't inventively used, just the typical pop up of a speeding crow or mysterious hand accompanied with a loud piercing noise. The ""Woman In Black"" herself seemed more youthful since her last outing, she was hardly frightening at all. The environment and the items within it aren't put to use at all, unlike its predecessor which utilised horrifically ancient toys to enhance the horror. There's just no memorability to it and unfortunately the same story is recycled. The lack of tension within the narrative has transformed what should've been a horror into a dramatic war flick (whilst still lacking any real drama). Something happens at the end but I couldn't tell you because I can never get to it without snoozing. I did rewind it back the next morning though, so don't worry...it's still boring. ""Angel of Death""? More like ""Angel of Narcolepsy""."
" Lacks a lot of substance
",0.0,-0.9577,2018-03-11 00:00:00,4,"A majority of sequels are way worse than the first movie. This one is no exception. During most of the movie you barely see anything. The lighting is so bad, that it soon becomes even boring to watch. A director switch to Tom Harper did not improve this movie at all. Even worse, here we have even more stupid jump scares lurking behind almost every corner and almost the only ""horrifying"" thing about this movie are these terrible loud sound effects, included for no reason but to hide the fact, that this movie lacks a lot of substance. I don't recommend seeing this one!"
" Cliché-fest
",0.0,-0.8945,2018-03-09 00:00:00,1,"Yet another horror film that feels like it was made with a by-the-numbers horror-film kit for the intellectually challenged. Are we never to have another that isn't just the same collection of clichés served up like a cheap oily burger and chips in a gaudy cardboard box? The heard-it-a thousand-times-before music, the tired old camera angles, the groan-inducing characters, as two-dimensional as the computer graphics that lend to every scene that flat, video game quality we've come to hate so much: yes, they're all here yet again, folks. Electronically distorted whispers that swell on the soundtrack whenever a character is being haunted, glass-eyed dolls and mechanical toys, cobwebbed corridors and peeling wallpaper, and, of course, jump-scares galore. But are these hackneyed sounds and images really what a paying audience is meant to accept as horror cinema in the 21st century? When will the cinema industry outgrow this ghost-train garbage and actually put in the effort and artistry and creativity to come up with something original, atmospheric, thought-provoking and genuinely frightening to put on our screens? For real horror these days one must turn to the news."
" The Woman in Black: Angel of Death tries hard to entertain and scare but somehow fails to deliver.
",-0.7783,-0.9862,2017-09-26 00:00:00,5,"The Woman in Black Angel of Death: Movie Review.The Woman in Black: Angel of Death is an okay type of fair horror movie with some creepy and scary elements. The movie has dark atmospheric tone and vibe and is visually stylish and sharp, but lacks the creepiness of the first part The Woman in Black film, still the movie has some visually dark and creepy sequences. The film lacks intensity and intriguing elements in it story because there is not much story. Main lead characters are dull and boring. The film lacks character development and there is very less feel of tension and scares. The story feels empty and undeveloped. The horror aspect of the movie seems hollow at certain points and has no deep or real impact. All over, its just a below average not so good horror film.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
" ""A bad movie, scary? Not at all I think we should stick to the prequel""
",-0.7717,0.8381,2017-09-16 00:00:00,4,This happens 40 years after the first encounter at the Eel Marsh house. A young woman and some children come back to stay in this famous house awakening the houses darkest secrets. Talking about the story it started off promising but soon went downhill. If you want to get some scares and don't care about the story line this movie is still not for you as there was nothing scary in this movie. I felt the acting was OK but they could not show their real talents if they get a story line like this. This movie was just made because they needed a sequel. I would suggest to stick to the prequel and don't watch this. The ending was predictable. A good part of this movie is that they cleared out the story of the ghost properly as it was not done in the prequel. No I would not suggest anyone to watch this movie.Notable ActingPhoebe FoxMy Rating 4/10
" Just like the first movie..
",0.3612,-0.9931,2017-07-21 00:00:00,5,"I'll be honest, I really don't understand the people who liked the first movie and hate this one for being just like the first movie.The only noticeable difference between both of them is that, in the first movie, there was a sense of isolation because of one person in the house, over a bunch of children and their two teachers.The awful jump ""scares"" are still here and the non-scary character of ""Woman in Black (WiB)"" returns. In-fact, they repeat the same mistakes from the first movie and try to explain way too much and show too much of the WiB character. Keeping WiB's character in shadows and not showing her terrible CGI/makeup caked face would've provided more terror than using her face for jump ""scare"" here and there.My complaint with both movies is the same. Despite having good acting (both of them) and good atmosphere, they fail to create proper horror the moment WiB shows up and her shtick of moving items and opening/closing doors begins all over again. They NEED to keep her in the dark and only show her dress, which some scenes actually DO.Unlike the first movie (6/10), I am giving this one 5/10 despite enjoying the acting of the lead actress and even the children, more than the last one (Radcliffe, nope.. did not like him much in that movie). One point taken off for shooting some key scenes in horrible lighting. The scenes in cellar are the ones I am talking about. The characters keep looking at items for so long and all you're doing is trying to squint and make out what in the hell they are actually looking at. All cellar scenes are intentionally shot under one candle-light or a lamp, and it's a bad idea. In one of the horror scenes with all characters in cellar, they keep trying to light a candle but WiB keeps blowing it out (or wind being passed by her?). But then, when the scene ends, the male character turns on his flashlight. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? He didn't turn on the flashlight when everyone was scared of darkness but did it instantly at the end? Really? They didn't think people would question that? He didn't even try to turn on the flashlight before, AT ALL.That said, this movie is NOT bad. It just does what the first one did. Ignore the people giving it 1/10 and whining about it being worse than the first one. They obviously had a hard-on for Radcliffe and gave that movie flying colors, despite him being average in that movie and rest of the movie being same as this one. Read the reviews of the first movie, many are first time horror viewers who are praising Radcliffe and obviously saw the horror movie cause they were Harry Potter fans. They then saw this movie thinking there would be some connection to Radcliffe but since he isn't here, they ended up focusing on the movie's flaws which were present in the first movie.While we're at it, REALLY? Are you seriously setting up the ending for another sequel? We all know that they want to milk the WiB cow till they won't make any profit from her at all. Both movies had $15 million budget and first one made them $125 million while this one made them about $49 million dollars. This is a nice profit even if the movie is just average. The third movie will make them even less profit it seems.Maybe end the movie as a trilogy then, cause we know they're gonna make a sequel. Just let it be the last one."
" A Sequel Lacking In Everything The Original Possessed - Even A Ghost!
",0.0,-0.9704,2017-05-08 00:00:00,1,"Hammer used to stand for Horror, so what the hell went wrong here?Firstly, where was The Woman In Black? The only time you see her is when you look at the advertising poster. As for Angel Of Death!... well there wasn't much to speak of at all. After watching this I was amazed it didn't get a PG certification, especially because there was nothing overtly frightening or horrifying about the story or the picture. The closest we came to an eerie atmosphere was when young Edward was trapped in the constantly locked, however always open, room where the spirit of The Woman resided, all we got then was a few moving toys and a dark shadow.I think the director, Tom Harper, was trying to build atmosphere and get the minds of the audience to ""fill in the blanks"", therefore immersing themselves into the story and film more. It didn't work.In fact, I'd probably recommend this film to all insomniacs as the banality within should put them to sleep quite fast.Did the studio pay its light bill? Because everything that was shot in darkness was so poor in visibility that if I even turned on an incidental light source the picture on the screen was near unwatchable!This is a travesty in Horror filmmaking, from the story (which is basic, lacking in substance, and holds no surprises) to the direction (which lacks style, atmosphere, and power).The only good thing about the whole movie is the acting though it's impossible to save this film."
" A word to directors ...
",0.0,-0.7834,2017-04-06 00:00:00,5,"... if you're going to try to cash in on success at least do it well! I loved The Woman in Black - both the original and the remake - and, like most people of the same opinion, looked forward to revisiting the spookiness of Eel Marsh House. What a let down!The acting is reasonable. Phoebe Fox looks suitably scared running along dark corridors and peering fearfully through windows. They all do their best within the limitations of the script and the direction. The film is annoyingly dark and hazy, which I imagine was an attempt to create atmosphere (as precious little else in the film does) but instead is just ... well, annoying! There are a few frights but the fright formula is repeated so frequently throughout the film that it becomes tedious and predictable. The real villain of this piece is the director. As a stand alone film this would probably scrape by as an average horror but the problem is we judge it against it's predecessor and it doesn't come close. The Woman in Black was a class act, atmospheric and spooky with some genuine frights and good acting. This looks like it was thrown together in a couple of days. Watch it if there's nothing else on telly but don't pay good money to see it."
" Disappointing sequel
",-0.4939,-0.4854,2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"The original TV version was outstanding. This version was a sequel to the Hammer version starring Daniel Radcliffe.Too many scenes were so dark as to obscure what was happening. The general gloom reduced the atmosphere rather than adding to it.Scriptwriting lacked a clear dynamic. The original story by Susan Hill was a classic ghost story and provided a credible premise for the haunting. It should be possible to build on this, but unfortunately this sequel failed to do this. Ostensibly, all the ingredients were present, but... well, it takes more than an old neglected house and a bunch of wartime child evacuees to make a spooky film.Too episodic in plot to be effective. Overall short on tension and thrills."
