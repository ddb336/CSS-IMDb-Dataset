" Damn!!!!
",0.0,0.8439,2021-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Gina's an amazing actress it turns out. Didn't feel too Hollywood, it felt real and believable. Amazing fight scenes! Had a great balance of tension and action, i was gripped man."
" Good Movie!
",0.4926,0.8655,2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,"One of Gina's best. Well acted, ans good cast. Only a few holes that didn't make sense but overall pretty decent!"
" She surely knows how to punch
",0.4404,0.5994,2021-03-08 00:00:00,8,"A fun action movie.
Quite a few scenes with good fights.
Thriller, and overall relatively reliable"
" It's In the Blood, in real life too
",0.0,0.9381,2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,Gina is one rare girl who manages to look cute and savage at the same time. And given the recent debacle she has managed to stay strong and true to her nature. And she really is one strong woman not like the airy heads who think they are strong just because some movie portrays them to be. Wishing her luck and looking forward to more of her movies.
" what a woman
",0.0,0.8442,2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,"A breath of fresh air in the genre full of fake strong women.
Like this English actress playing in the last installments of Star Wars.
She is so bland I would not even recall her name.
Wish Gina all the best for her future career."
" Nice Ride
",0.4215,0.9871,2021-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed the role reversal in this film, with Gina being the savior. It's nice to see a strong female lead being the hero, usually only seen in vengeance movies. Here we have Gina protecting her spouse and being the protagonist, doing the saving and doing the fighting, we need more of this type of roles for females, not all guys have to be the strong one. Girls can be the hero/protector too in a situation other than vengeance or motherly roles, as this film proves.Acting is fine, storyline is good, and of course the action is well done and believable. Cinematography is well done aside form a fee shaky cams, but seem to be appropriately placed. Enjoyed, certainly worth having a collection. I still like Scorched Earth better, really dug that film, but this is certainly a nice addition to anyone's collection."
" Great action movie

" Can't believe this movie has bad reviews. Honestly of the best B-Movies I've ever seen.
",0.5719,0.9825,2020-12-25 00:00:00,9,"Normally I'm not fan of Gina Carano while shes stunningly beautiful, performs great stunts, and sells the kickass action babe role well. The rest of her acting is as wooden as door. However I saw quite few actors I like were in this film and thought to give it a try.Wow was I impressed with this one. Great acting all around (Even from Carano), non-stop action, great pacing, awesome visuals, and a good premise. The whole entire time I was heavily engaged with this film and really enjoyed it alot.Honestly I wanted to give it 10 star review so bad but I diddn't because while I thought the end of movie was ok. I just thought they could went bunch different directions with it that would been better. Overall definitely recommend this as weekend watch."
" I Want To See More Gina Action Films
",0.0772,0.9576,2020-08-24 00:00:00,9,"This movie was a classic blend of action thrills and kills, and manages to maintain a high level of tension and suspense throughout. Gina has excellent stage presence as a formidable, believable female action hero and martial artist.As a lifelong fan of the greats like Stallone, Van Damme and Schwarzenegger and as an ardent student of the Asian Cult cinema and kung fu entertainment genre, I must say Gina proves she can be on that level and she seems to do it with ease.I want more Gina Carano films like this please sign me up! She's so cute and so bad-ass!"
" Another Trash

" In The Blood Is type negative
",-0.5719,0.9934,2019-08-12 00:00:00,5,"In The BloodYet another vehicle to try and further the movie career of ex-MMA pioneer Gina Carano.
'In The Blood' is a movie that may have been big business back in the 80's or early 90's but thankfully today's audiences are a little more sophisticated.
Not to say that the premise isn't worth exploring. Sadly though it's just not very well executed.When Ava's husband goes missing on their Caribbean honeymoon she must unleash a secret set of skills on her husbands abductors in order to bring him back.
Yes, Ava (Carano) has a secret passed.
Her father, played by a under-utilised Stephen Lang trained her from a young age in the arts of arse kickery.
When she gets no help from local authorities and her new father in law suspects her of foul play, Ava goes all out as a one woman army to bring the baddies to justice.
Sounds good doesn't it?
Nice to have a strong female lead doing the ass kicking for a change and Carano is certainly up to the task.
Sadly though all is a little uninspired.
Carano never looks good onscreen when doing the action stuff.
Her combat scenes look awkward.
Sure she looks beautiful in her red dress in the nightclub fight scene but choreography is so poor the fisticuffs has no fluidity.
Add some choppy editing and all what we paid to see is incoherent.
Carano is more than capable but never given chance to shine due to poor direction.
John Stockwell helms this movie with no vigour.
The action is action-less.
'In The Blood' doesn't get the blood flowing and ends up becoming yet another lacklustre action movie condemned to the DVD bargain bin.In terms of image quality this movie is great to look at. Colours are bold and contrast sizzles.
Once again the nightclub scene springs to mind with neon hues bursting from the screen.
Also the red material of Ava's dress is vibrant against the deep blue glow of the darkened club.
Vegetation is lush green.
The Zip line scene is nicely staged with the bold green jungle below.
A digital grain free image that is crisp and slick.
Shame then that the actual movie is sloppy.
Sound quality in Dolby Digital Plus is adequately mixed but nothing to write home about.
Guns bang and punches thud accordingly.
In The Blood is a film forgotten as soon as credits role but Carano is definitely the best thing about this average movie.
She's a star that isn't being allowed to shine.
I don't know what blood type this film is but judging this as a movie, it's definitely a negative"
" Some great violence but nonsensical and ultimately incoherent
",0.0,-0.9902,2019-06-15 00:00:00,4,"I would say the first two thirds of IN THE BLOOD is really good. Not great, but there is some very tough B-movie action and some really awesome and nasty violence, especially that meted out by the hero (Gina Carano). So Gina's character finds out her husband is dead, and the film peaks right there. If you just switch it off and imagine what follows you will be better off.I have a bit of a taste for unpleasantly vicious B-movies and the ending of this one reminded me of the well known Charles Bronson vehicle THE EVIL THAT MEN DO. That was a pretty stupid film, but like this one was slightly redeemed by a willingness to show violence that more tasteful mainstream films are likely to eschew. THE EVIL THAT MEN DO has a dumb ending, but this one is dumber. Really, I cannot believe it is as dumb as it is. It has no redeeming features whatsoever. It seems completely arbitrary, like the action movie dream of a ten year old child.Sorry. Gina Carano is really great and I would be willing to watch even a mediocre action film with her in it. Why she went from HAYWIRE to this I simply cannot say."
" HARDER, QUICKER, FASTER, DIRTIER
",-0.34,-0.7713,2019-05-09 00:00:00,7,"Ava (Gina Carano) has had a hard life as the daughter of a criminal. She grew up hard and fast by a daddy who instructed her how to defend herself. As an addict she meets Derek (Cam Gigandet) a rich gentleman who marries her. On their island honeymoon, Derek has an accident and goes missing. The police are reluctant to help. Ava must go ""walking tall"" all over a poor tropical island while being sought by the police.Gina Carano is a more convincing tough girl than the models and twinkies who have played those roles. The film is fairly formulaic except it does have some welcomed unexpected twists. Danny Trejo is on the screen far less than Ismael Cruz Cordova, but you might ask who the heck is Ismael Cruz Cordova.Decent action film with some cat fighting. Although I don't understand why she spared Silvio Lugo (Amaury Nolasco) when we waxed that other guy.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" One grade A+ movie !
",0.0,0.8313,2019-03-11 00:00:00,10,"I caught this movie when it came out in 2014 and I watch it at least once a year since. The acting is absolutely up to my standards , the scenery is lush and beautiful and I do not mean just Gina, the corruptive characters are realistically believable , the friendly islanders are just as realistic , the fight scenes are some of my favorites I have ever seen , and her relentless pursuit to find/save her husband reminds me of my stubborn determination. If you have not seen ""In the Blood"" 2014 version you owe it to yourself to give it a try!"
" Full of Action Film
",0.0,0.9548,2019-02-22 00:00:00,6,"When Ava (Gina Carano) meets Derek Grant (Cam Gigandet), they fall in love and marry with each other under the protest of his wealthy father Robert Grant (Treat Williams) that believes Ava is a gold digger. Ava had a tough childhood with her abusive father Casey (Stephen Lang) that trained her in martial arts and other fights. Ava and Derek travel to Caribe in honeymoon and soon they meet the local Manny (Ismael Cruz Cordova) that invites them to go to a fashion night club. The powerful gangster Big Biz (Danny Trejo) hits on Ava and Derek and she fight with his minions. On the next morning, Manny takes them to a tyrolean crossing but out of the blue, Derek has a problem with his gear and falls off in a valley, breaking his leg. Ava finds him and an ambulance takes Derek to a local clinic. Ava follows the ambulance in Manny´s motorcycle but crashes and loses the sight the ambulance. When she goes to the clinic, she does not find Derek. She goes to the police station and Chief Ramón Garza (Luis Guzmán) promises to help her. But soon Ava discovers that there is a conspiracy and decides to look for her beloved husband alone.""In the Blood"" Is a full of action film where the greatest attraction is Gina Carano. She proves to be an excellent action hero. The flawed story has many plot holes but is highly entertaining. The motives for the abduction and the accident of Derek Grant is messy and does not make sense. The beginning is promising but the conclusion is the weak part of the plot. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Sangue na Veia"" (""Blood in the Vein"")"
" I give it 7
",0.0,0.7455,2018-07-30 00:00:00,7,"I give it 7 for the great plot, the great actor gaming and realistic scenes, the girl's main character was killing it, I enjoyed every minute watching.
I kept 3 stars for the husband who was running and fighting with milled leg, I myself had a leg broken and you can't step on this thing for 3 months, not talking for kicking someone with it and standing on it like nothing being there at the end of the episode. Other thing is the bubbles at the tube of the system at the hospital. Seriously?
Second and third stars are for the lame ending. So after chick killed the half island narco boss just let her go and killed one of his people to give example? Eh... Please, I expected more.After all I have to say it was pretty good movie and watching was worth it. I would love to see more productions like this one."
" real women hero and muscle
",0.5574,0.3167,2018-07-12 00:00:00,7,"I love the fighting scene of gina, its look more natural than gal gadot on wonder woman.
this is great real action thriller movie.

" Every vacationer's nightmare.
",0.0,-0.9001,2018-06-23 00:00:00,6,"6/22/18. Expect plenty of action when Carano takes no prisoners. Imagine having a wife like this - guys, no need to worry about anything. Plays to the fears we all have of having things go wrong while vacationing in a country where you don't know the language."
" Fast paced action film with a woman in lead. Never a dull moment.
",0.3089,-0.1635,2018-01-08 00:00:00,8,Fast paced action film with a woman in lead. Gina Carano plays the wife who never gives up her search for her lost husband in a hostile environment with even the police gunning for her. Never a dull moment. Extremely watchable.
" It's Gina Carrano, ...in feature film
",0.0,0.9517,2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"I don't know if this is Gina's first ever film, or if she could ever learn to act, and I don't care - she is terrible as actress here, but she is still a champion and charismatic girl - that much we all know. I love her just for being in front of camera and show of some of her moves, although plot isn't that bad, at least not as much as acting. This is a film that usually gets between 1 and 3, 4 at most, but I'll give it 6, although I was tempted to give it 7 or 8 :-)"
