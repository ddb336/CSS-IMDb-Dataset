" Jason Statham! Enough said.
",0.0,0.9157,2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,"I first saw Statham in Transporter... by the end of the first scene in that movie I was a fan. That was close to 2 decades ago, and probably around 25 of his movies I have watched by now. The thing about Jason is that he's not even acting. He's just being himself. He plays the same character in virtually every single movie - and that's what's great about him. There is a great sense of honesty and realism in Jason Statham's acting. His fight scenes are the best of the best. Even if the movie itself is not great, which is rare, I've not once had any regrets watching any of his movies, because the fighting scenes redeem the movie. It also seems like the people who act in his movies, know exactly what they are getting themselves into, because they know exactly how Jason will play his role.''Wild Card'' was a great movie, and the fight scenes were superb!!! I don't give many movies above a 7 stars, but the fight scenes and the intense storyline puts this one a cut above most action movies."
" Winner Winner Chicken Dinner
",0.8225,0.9157,2021-03-27 00:00:00,7,I liked this film. It has enough plot twists and character quirks to keep it out of well-plowed turf. Statham plays a kick-ass guy but without the usual self-confident bravado he usually brings. The film has a great Christmas soundtrack and makes good use of Las Vegas locales. I also liked the twist ending.
" Quite boring
",-0.3804,-0.4391,2021-03-14 00:00:00,2,This movie does revolve around the gambling addiction of the main character and there is a line where he helps a molested girlfriend. The first action scene is 40 minutes into the movie and at the end there are 2 more scenes. These scenes are very short and all combined makes this movie quite a struggle to get through.
" Love the action
",0.6369,0.9064,2021-03-12 00:00:00,8,"This is another flick that if you are a Statham fan, you'll like this movie. The action sequences are crisp. This is why he's so popular. He makes every move count and he has good onscreen presence and style. In this case, he's in Vegas and his name is Nick Wild and he's a security agent. Yes, it has F-words and he's dealing with mobsters who he has had contact with before. All this revolves around a casino he frequents and he's a blackjack player. He whips up on some mobsters who busted up a woman the has a history with. So when he hamstrings these guys and lets her get her revenge on em they come after him. That's where it all goes. Hot time in Vegas!"

",0.0,-0.636,2021-02-21 00:00:00,2,"This movie reminds me of the Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi movie ""neighbors"". Where all through the movie I sat there saying it's going to get better now any minute, any minute now it's going to get better... And before you know it... The credits are rolling. And then you sit there in a mindless mental whimper, thinking about how you've just wasted two hours of your life watching a movie that's one of the top 10 worst movies you've ever seen. Then the analysis begins... Why did I waste two hours of my life watching this, what made me think this was going to be a good movie, was the trailer really that far off or did I not read far enough into it? Even the reviews here are way overrated... This movie should max out at 3.5 stars and that's it!"

If you're looking for an epic or even a knock you out of your socks movie, well, your expectations are probably too high, but on a criminal, not so criminal, level this movie works. Bad reviews are maybe per expectations, (I'm not so sure...), but if you just want an hour and a half of entertainment, this movie work."

" Loser
",-0.5267,-0.4316,2020-12-02 00:00:00,5,"Jason Statham is a bodyguard and a loser. He works out of Los Vegas with a dream of putting together half a million dollars so he can go to Sardinia and bum around in a sailboat for five years. When he helps Dominik Garcia gain vengeance on Milo Ventimiglia, who had raped and disfigured her, she gives him $25,000, which he runs up into the half million. can he keep the money and split? And what happens when Garcia calls in his mob connections?Jason Statham is, in many ways, the successor to Burt Reynolds and he stars in the sort of movie that Reynolds would be starring in these days ... bearing in mind that nowadays these are a lot more brutal, and Statham glowers instead of grinning. He's got a tiny range; he was a street hustler when Guy Ritchie tapped him for LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, and his vehicles have depended on his physicality and movies carefully tailored to him. Fortunately, this was written by William Goldman, and features Stanley Tucci in a toupee."
" very average JS movie

" plodding, actionless, predictable... sad
",-0.4767,0.5245,2020-11-11 00:00:00,2,"The modern film noir / action genre is not known for producing award nominated films, just gritty entertainment. Not every film can be Payback, The Usual Suspects, or Ronin, yet I appreciate their efforts. However Wild Card is dull and predictable, with entire conversations that are complete nonsense (almost monologues), and there is very little action. Jason Statham and William Goldman, despite their considerable individual talents, do not pair well in this movie and Simon West could not pull all the pieces together to make a functional film."
" Very good
",0.4927,0.9773,2020-08-26 00:00:00,8,"What a film.
This is very textbook film noir.
Nick Wild (Jason Statham) has to balance the scale of morality.
Cinematographically good, most of the time. Sometimes almost clich√© (like the introduction scene of Stanley Tucci).
But overall a very good film. Intense scenes. Good camerawork. Good action scenes. Good storyline. Great car."
" Forgettable Jason Statham movie
",0.0,0.3291,2020-08-19 00:00:00,5,"Typical Jason Statham action, JS plays the same character as every other one of his movies and that's ok if you like JS(and I do). Problem is the lame predictable story and boring supporting characters. Exception is Stanley Tucci who is always good but his role is small."
" No real plot
",-0.296,0.9873,2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,"The movie follows the main character, Nick, throughout couple of days. The protagonist's (Nick) ambition throughout the film is weak. He doesn't really stand for anything. Even when his 'friend (?)' asks him to help her find her assaulters he refuses to initially help. When he finally does, he's half-hearted about it; running on the motive of clearing the guilt he faces over his passivity.The film gradually reveals weaknesses about Nick, like how he's a gambling addict and how he lacks passion and vision in his life. The gambling aspect shows how he likes to take shortcuts on the way to success. The lack of passion tells us that he won't stand for anything, even his vision. In fact the only vision of himself in the future is to be on a sail boat in the ocean and not working for 5 years.I believe the writers portrayed him like that not just to draw attention to his fantastic fighting abilities, but to also show that heros aren't perfect. In fact, one of the side-plots follows Nick developing a standoffish friendship with a young insecure millionaire who idolises him for his bravery. We see Nick struggle with this relationship because he realises that the things people think him to be (that he is brave, fearless and bold) set an expectation on him that is higher than how he is actually living.
While we get no back story on him, we see a gradual (albeit simple) character development in Nick.All in all, it seems the writers tried to convert a standard retribution plot-line into something more complex. They could've spent a little more time focusing on the key elements of the story and the main character. Possibly even removing side-stories that bloated the film rather than tie it together.
However, I do give the writers props for trying a more creative approach to a simple plot. I hope ingenuity like that continues from them. Keep it up; creativity gives you an extra star in your review."
" People who think about their movies will hate.
",-0.5719,-0.9655,2020-07-07 00:00:00,4,"This movie is bad, really bad. You are not sure what is going on, what is the plot(seems to be a collection of unrelated subplots), no character development to help understand why they are doing whatever, dumbest police ever (again), dumbest villains (again) and cookie-cutter bad guys.There are 2.5 action fight scenes (one is very good I will admit) and the rest is pointless babble. Oh, two of the three leads that are top of the credits have a total of about eight boring minutes..combined..so very very misleading.It gets 4 stars for one of the action scenes, otherwise it is a 3."
" I've seen much better Ones from Jason Statham...

" Play what you've been dealt with
",0.34,0.8687,2020-06-24 00:00:00,8,"So Jason Statham is an action star. I think there are no two ways about that. Now you may like him or not, which is an entirely different story. And you may have issues with how the story builds or how his character evolves here. You may even think he's not up for the task, when it comes to the drama and the fine motivations he has.All valid feelings which I won't take away from you. Having said that though, when it comes to the stunts and the action, he shines quite clearly. So overall I think he is the right man for the job. And while many things seem inevitable and you may shake your head at certain things he does (you still probably wish you could be him), the movie tells a fine story about a very flawed character - I waited to see this, because the extended cut was never released in Germany. I got it and I watched it - and I liked what I saw. No wonder considering who was responsible for the stunts/fight scenes by the way ..."
" Wild Card
",0.0,0.899,2020-05-29 00:00:00,6,"The Stath is a tough guy in Last Vegas who has lots of friends who he helps out - he is also addicted to gambling. When a friend is badly beaten and abused by the son of a mob boss, he reluctantly sorts them out but must face the consequences.This calls on Statham to give a pretty decent performance as a man who, whilst tough and cool
on the outside, is mixed up inside. The plot has a few minor twists and turns to keep you entertained and of course includes a liberal sprinkling of the usual sublime fight sequences. Definitely worth catching."
" It's what you expect JS
",0.0,0.8293,2020-05-13 00:00:00,7,"The poor ratings are deceiving. It's Jason Statham doing what he does best, the English hard man.
No, it's not a Guy Ritchie film with a beautifully woven plot with many complex characters, but if you like a few, very good fight scenes it's not a bad film at all. The use of implements are worth watching alone."
" Surprisingly subpar
",0.296,-0.873,2020-05-12 00:00:00,4,Not Jason Stathams best movie...has to be the worst I've seen of his. But I blame poor supporting cast. There was no connection at all or cohesion between them at all.
" PLAY YOUR HAND
",0.6808,-0.9919,2020-05-09 00:00:00,10,"We know where we stand with Jason Stratham and he with us too. We pay for what he offers and we get our monies worth. Here he is again in a story that centers around his ability to kill you but he does not and that is what he is known for both in and out of the movies. Hollywood has taken the concept of revenge and used it for entertainment purposes and this movie helps it along. In the movie, when the bad guy gets a comeuppance we not only like it but insert ourselves into the movie and ask what would we do? Of course our adrenaline is worked up, we have seen our enemy as ruthless and we want the ultimate payback but we don't get it. Why? The movie is not ready to end yet so we get a small does of behave yourself or else next time lesson presented. When the situation presents itself again, we are not disappointed and we finally get our closure. That's what this movie offers i.e. an emotional roller-coaster ride for the viewer and their emotions. It is interesting to note that if a man was so skilled in the art of the kill, in the moment under any conditions he would act like Jason in this movie. The how is very convincing to see this take place. BTW...I met a real life trained military killer that was having trouble debriefing. He kept re-living all his kills and kept his ""kill"" ability up. During our brief interaction/discussion, he kept staring at my chin, neck and face. At the right time, I asked why he was doing that? He said I could have killed you three different ways. That's how deeply ingrained this training was. He could glance at you and see the kill spot! Wild Bill Hickok had something similar with the use of his twin colt revolvers. They became a part of his body and hands. He never had to aim just point and shoot and you were dead. He never missed either. This type of training depends on your skill set and learning abilities however nearly all martial artists will tell you that at some point it all diminishes with age and time but in its prime, it delivers. Enjoy the part in this move where they hold an underworld trial to determine guilt or innocence with the penalty being death if decided against you. Jason remains cool as a cucumber, reasons out his position and the trial judge in question even has to admit he is that good. Worthy watch so get to it. I record it so I can speed it up and review the fight scenes...."
" Gives a whole new meaning to ""spooning""
",0.0,-0.7906,2020-05-04 00:00:00,5,"Jason Statham is a highly trained bodyguard with a gambling problem. When his friend is badly beaten up, he sets out to avenge this but discovers the responsible hoodlum is the son of a heavy hitter and so he is soon being chased by all sorts. There are quite a few pointless sub-plots - especially involving Diminik Garcia as ""Holly"" who has been abused and is also out for revenge. Michael Angarano also features as the shoot 'em up equivalent of the ""Cowardly Lion"" and Stanley Tucci (with hair) appears briefly too. There are not many action scenes - what there are are staged to within an inch of their life, and what's left is really rather mundane. It's fine if you like the genre, but Statham has done many better films than this."
" Seemed long...
",0.0,-0.9452,2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"...for a 90 minute movie.The scene where Nick was winning a lot of money seemed to drag.Was I supposed to care about Nick? At the beginning, he's portrayed as a con man. Then, he's paid money for making a hot girl (S.V.) fall in love with a dumpy bald guy. (He let the bald guy ""beat him up"" in front of the hot girl). Nick doesn't take all the money, yet he's day dreaming about getting enough money to leave Las Vegas. Ugh.What was the point of Nick finding the bad guy only to tell Holly he didn't find him...then later dealing with him?Nick was an ahole to his perspective client. You would think that someone wanting to make money to leave town would take on as many reasonable clients as he could get. The job seemed like easy money.It seemed everyone in town knew Nick and liked him, but he was an a$$ to customers???Amazing, Nick can cause a lot of damage, hurt/kill people with no consequences.Was I supposed to care about Holly? Actually, she had a really good reason for wanting revenge, but her acting skills didn't pull off the emotion properly. When she gets revenge, she only takes money from the guy who abused her. Sure, she made the guy squirm, but she should have given him more of a punishment. Maybe not hedge clipper punishment, but...The fight scenes were good, but there's too much crap between the fight scenes. The non-fight scene time should have been used for better character development, but that's where the movie fell flat. We really didn't know enough about the characters to properly care.This movie is OK, if you're bored and need something to watch."
" The plot was nonsensical
",0.0,-0.8271,2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Nothing about the plot made any sense. The story was merely an excuse for fight scenes. If you just want to see some brutal fight scenes without a credible plot, this is the movie for you."
" Rating is Too Low
",-0.2732,0.9703,2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,"I think a lot of people are watching this expecting the usual action-action-action you get from the typical Jason Stathan film. This movie doesn't have many shootouts, no explosions, and only three (still very impressively choreographed) fight scenes. It's much more of a drama and a character piece. Statham is a (recovering?) gambling addict living in Vegas who (maybe?) wants to earn enough cash to get out of there. He doesn't want to be ""bloody"" like he used to, to earn a living, and does odd jobs as a chaperone (aka bodyguard) for people visiting Las Vegas to make ends meet. The bottom line is, he doesn't like violence but knows how to fight when he has to because he's tough as nails.A friend of his who he owes gets beaten by a mafioso and his two hired thugs in a hotel room so Nick (Statham) gets dragged into a situation which, try as he may to avoid it, turns violent. The story is good, the acting is good, and the action is sparse but very well done when it comes upon him.Also bonus points for a great supporting cast. Stanley Tucci is awesome. Just don't blink or you'll miss all these people!"
" I enjoyed it.
",0.5106,0.9016,2020-02-16 00:00:00,8,Fight scenes are excellent. But not many - be warned. This is not high octane outside those scenes.Could have been more in depth the the supporting cast but only because they were interestingIt was strong for the type of film it is.
" Possibly best Statham film
",0.6369,0.8897,2020-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes you get your favourite actor in a film that was cheaply made and was barely noticed on release. Mostly that's because that film was terrible as were they in it. This is the complete opposite. Hummingbird was supposed to be Statham on full acting mode, but that film was awful, this is him at his best acting. The set up is long don't get me wrong but stick with it because you are rewarded with some Corey Yuen choreographed greatness for the last hour. It's a B movie with an A Lister eventually followed by some A+ action choreography!!! Check it out, stay with it, you will not be dissapointed!!"
" Wild Card: It Take More Than Just Screenplay
",0.0,0.9818,2020-02-05 00:00:00,6,"I came across this film, ""Wild Card,"" directed by Simon West, while surfing Amazon Prime. The description immediately sounded just exactly like Burt Reynolds's ""Heat,"" directed by Dick Richards, one of my favorite movies. So I watched it on Prime and, lo and behold, it was the exact same script! But I have to tell you, Burt's was way, way better. Maybe I just like everything that he did. Except the Smokey and the Bandit films. So both films were written by William Goldman. I was under the impression that a screenplay or script title could not be resubmitted under multiple titles.
But the interesting things about these two versions are the interpretations by the choices of the actors and the directors. The Heat action scenes were so well executed. But the main difference between the directors's vision for this film is the ability to integrate the subplots to support the whole as a cohesive solid story. But, I have always said, the movie cracks if the props and makeup are not spot on. And in Wild Card, they weren't. So, it is my opinion that Heat hit all the benchmarks. Wild Card, not so much!"
" Smooth Fight Scenes & Lucid Gambling

",0.0,-0.5255,2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,"""Wild Card"" is a decent enough actioner featuring Jason Statham's patented close-in fighting. This one features Las Vegas as a locale but it's the older Vegas not the newer one. Film does include ""Modern Family""'s Sofia Vergara - yea! - but would've been MUCH more watchable with her in the leading role of ""Holly"" instead of the three-minute cameo she had. Also, some story elements like when he bets it all on a hand of Blackjack is just dumbness, everyone on this planet would've held some back, no matter how hot you think you are. Anyway, fight sequences are on point and that's why you watch Jason."

Acting was reasonable.The main character is played well but leaves a lot of his backstory up to our imaginations. I would have liked to have seen this fleshed out a little more in terms of how he wound up where he did with his skill set - for example, using common objects at hand as weapons - and why he has been called upon professionally to apply it the way he does. I would have also liked to have known a little more about the female characters who seem to be very familiar with him, or had the relationships developed a little. But I guess that's irrelevant if the focus is on displaying martial arts equivalent choreography. The boy wonder role I suppose was meant to help get it at the backstory / relationship angle, but it didn't add much overall."

" A different ending than I expected . . .
",0.0,0.97,2019-09-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie was a refreshing change from the typical action garbage I've been seeing lately. The acting was good, the filming was good, the direction was good, and the story was good. I can't believe it doesn't have a higher rating from people here. It should at least get an 8 out of 10 stars. The story is similar to a lot of other stories about people in Las Vegas that tangle with mobsters, but the ending is better than most, and the action is well-done. The characters are believable, and there aren't a bunch of faults in the movie, like so many other movies have in them these days. Does it really deserve a 10 out of 10? Well, maybe not, but I felt I needed to raise the rating a bit, because I totally disagree with the low rating it had when I decided to watch it. I haven't seen an action flick that good in weeks . . . maybe months. It must be in the top three action movies made in 2015, I'm sure.So it doesn't have a lot of nudity and sex or even shooting, but it does have action, and it does have a better-than-normal story. It's well worth watching."
" Solid Statham action
",0.1531,-0.3012,2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,"This film sees Jason Statham playing Nick Wild, a body guard working in Las Vegas. The jobs he gets are nothing special and he dreams of saving up enough money so that he can live on a yacht in Corsica for five years... unfortunately he also gambles. One day he gets a call from his friend Holly; she has been brutally assaulted and raped by a man staying in a suite with two body guards. She says she wants to track him down so she can sue him but clearly she wants revenge. Nick asks a few questions and it turns out the man is Danny DeMarco, the son of a powerful east coast mob boss. Holly has her revenge and DeMarco is humiliated. Nick knows that he will have to leave town fast; he just has to raise $500,000 first!This film is darker in town than most of Jason Statham's flicks; there may be less fighting than most of his films but what there is feels less stylised and more brutal... there is also the small matter of Holly threatening to remove DeMarco's manhood with a pair of gardening sheers... he may be a totally unsympathetic character but the scene had me wincing... and surprised that it happened in a UK-15 rated film! There is some humour in the film; notably when it becomes apparent why Nick lost an early fight and some of his interaction with the rich but scared client Cyrus Kinnick. On the down side the gambling scene does drag a bit. Jason Statham is on good form in the lead role; being solid in the 'acting scenes' and great in the action. The rest of the cast are solid enough. Overall this is a good film which fans of Jason Statham will want to see."

There's not much to his character aside from the fact that he seems to do his job well and help people who needs it.Storywise, the setting and narrative aren't that interesting. Even the action sequences that some people are praising which only occurs a few times, didn't really strike me as thrilling. The use of slow-mo? There are other films (e.g. The Equalizer) that does it better in my opinion. Given that there are only a few of these action sequences, they should've at least made the story more interesting to compensate for the lack of action, but it didn't.I'd say you can check it out if you still want to and see it for yourself since you might view the film differently.

" Beautifully shot, great fight scenes but nothing flows. Watch Parker instead.
",0.4767,0.9857,2019-04-09 00:00:00,4,"I enjoy a good London Gangster movie or crime/action movie as much as the next person but compared to War or even Parker this movie just doesn't flow. I almost believe that re-edited cutting and moving scenes around would bump this movie up a couple of stars but as it is it just keeps feeding dribs and drabs like a TV series but not building enough momentum. The start is slow, should have cut and started with the (spoilers) hospital scene. It's a beautifully shot movie, well acted with some excellent action and fight sequences and it could easily have been better but nothing ties together, no major plot, no escalation or climax. It just bumbles on then ends with most of the motivation being for a girl who uses him anyway. Parker is just a 'score' movie but it has drama, great fight scenes and the plot stands up. Watch something else. Oh yes, Christmas music when it plays no part in the story at all. Las Vegas and Christmas classics."

" Statham plays his cards right with this one!
",0.3164,0.957,2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Wild CardYou gotta love Jason Statham.
It doesn't matter if he's giving Sly and Arnie a helping hand in The Expendables or battling a giant prehistoric shark out on the ocean.
Statham has screen presence and buckets of charisma.
An action star who looks like he can actually kick ass!
In this movie helmed by Simon West. A director who's no stranger to the action genre. Wild Card is something of a unique surprise.
Sure it features Statham dishing out copious amounts of whoop ass but the films plot weaves and arcs in some unexpected directions making this movie a gripping watch.Statham plays Nick Wild a Bodyguard in Las Vegas who happens to have a gambling problem.
He finds himself on the wrong side of the Mob after helping a friend get some deserved payback.
Wild Card goes from being a straight up revenge tale to a high stakes casino drama and then back to a bloody action yarn.
This constant change of direction is both the movie's strength and weakness.
Some may feel that the film doesn't really know what it's trying to be.
I however ultimately feel that this movie plays the hand that life deals you.
Real life is often unexpected and forever changing its course.
This film is almost like a window to a brief period in the life of Nick Wild.
Don't get me wrong I aren't implying that this film is true to life!
It's a movie with Jason Statham in it after all.If you sit back and let proceedings wash over you it's an enjoyable piece of cinema made so mainly by the lead star and some tidy direction.
Simon West as Director flexes his own muscles here.
The Blackjack scenes in the casino are riveting and a certain scene involving some garden shears had me on the edge of my seat with legs tightly crossed.
All you guys out there will instantly know what I mean when you see it.
The fight choreography is also supremely staged with some nice slow-mo shots that add impact to every blow.
West has held back the camera allowing the audience to see the violence. Shaky cam is minimal. There's nothing to hide here. Statham can do the ass kicking stuff in his sleep.All in all I had a entertaining time with this movie. It surprised me by being better than I thought it had any right to be."
" Same old
",0.0,0.1027,2019-03-07 00:00:00,5,Honestly I think Statham is one of the world's weakest actors who has risen to fame. His characterization and facial expressions are all the same. This film is no exception. Fairly forgettable film

Fire can wait for next 30 mins for anything to happen. Then there is the episode in the casino,The plot is like a primate jumping from branch to branch. never really doing anything other than jumping. then there is a last branch and the movie ends."
" Nice.
",0.4215,0.952,2018-12-20 00:00:00,6,"I watched this and afterwards felt strange. Something was missing. I genuinely liked this, I like Statham pretty much anything he's at, and rest of the cast did a decent job, nothing to complain on that department. This was also pleasant for the eyes, not the usual shaky-cam extravaganza. Visuals were... They were okay, I guess. I haven't been to Las Vegas, but I'd imagine it looking like it did in the movie, just with heck of a lot more people milling around. I have seen my fair share of movies and television shows located there. So far nothing to complain. Kept scratching my head, then decided to see what others thought about this.Okay. Plot was paper thin. Easy to follow but I bet it was easy to write as well, and it shows. It lacks the actual story behind everything. Something happens and were introduced to some interesting characters, but there's really no flesh on the bones. No back stories, no connection between characters unless you imagine it by yourself from the scattered and unfortunately quite generic hints were given.I suspect the rating of this would be at least few notches higher had the script been written with a little more thought in details."
" Wild Card gambles its drama for pointless action.
",0.0,-0.8745,2018-11-24 00:00:00,4,"Just when I thought Statham was choosing better roles as he got older and more experienced, he still settles for annoyingly dull rubbish like this. Now, that might sound harsh, but there was potential here for decent drama given the themes of gambling addiction and alcoholism. Alas, we get a muddled narrative that delivers a royal flush in actually delivering nothing. An ex-bodyguard attempts to escape Las Vegas but keeps getting drawn back to the flashing lights of its grand casinos. There's a useless introductory scene involving a terrible performance from Vergara, that highlights the alcohol addiction of Statham's character. A wealthy boy, yet another terrible performance from Angarano, shows up and wants a tour of the casinos. A woman gets assaulted, to which Statham confronts the abuser. Tucci is in it for two minutes. A plethora of pointless slow motion snoozefests. And yet here I am thinking to myself ""these scenarios mean nothing!"". There is absolutely no narrative cohesion whatsoever. Just random scenes stringed together set in Las Vegas. It was as if the screenwriter was playing ""52 card pickup"". Potential was present though, as there is a decent twenty minute scene with the main character winning half a million dollars and unable to escape the temptation of gambling it all away. If the theme of gambling was prevalent throughout, this could've been an excellent character study. Statham gives a good performance, but director West just had to put action in it. I can't believe I'm saying this, but for the first time in a Statham flick there should not have been any action. It detracts from the realism and drama of the whole story. It's frustrating, as the production and the pacing are absolutely fine. Decent even! But the story, supporting cast and themes were poorer than an individual losing all of their hard earned money on a roulette wheel. The box office numbers evidently show this."

",0.5574,0.9865,2018-11-19 00:00:00,7,"What can be said about Jason Statham, who plays the same role over and over again? All that can be said about every other Jason Statham movie is if he has played that very same role with verve and penache? In other words: does he look cool in ""Wild Card""? Yeah, he does, kinda... Any action fan will love this flick. But dont hold your horses yet, it aint a Jason Statham classic. There are better Jason Statham flicks out there.What is special about this particular Jason Statham flick is the fantastic photography of the fighting scenes. Lots of attention to detail went into the fighting scenes which are truly one of the best. Great fighting scenes dont make a good movie though. But the story is nice enough. The jokes are not great, but aint annoying either. Although it is still formula stuff, it is the good kind of formula stuff. Reasonably cool, enjoyable blokes movie."

" Unique taste with unpleasant ending
",-0.4767,0.9899,2017-12-29 00:00:00,8,"The one true merit of this film is the unusual feeling it gives to you. It goes deep. Deep, that it is hard to recognize it at first. Soon, it starts growing into an overwhelming feeling, but it shifts back into a comfortable feeling at the very right time and alleviates the intensity. The balance of this and its originality makes the film very memorable, in contrast with some other films in which the feelings become very burdensome and make you suffer.Cinematography was adequate, could notice some pleasing to the eye shots. Nonetheless, there were no memorable cinematography parts. Didn't feel any discomfort because of editing. The text at the beginning looked great. Fight scenes were comfortable to watch (in a way that it is good). I am a big fan of Jason Statham, his acting and accent, so I enjoyed his show.The main detriment of this film is the ending. I sometimes have a hard time understanding deep movies, but here it felt like the ending was a drive for the whole plot to continue. Sadly, it ended there. It didn't convince me that Nick had found a solution to his life. One minute I was going to give this film a 9/10, but the other this minus changed everything instantly. Another negative aspect of this movie is its lack of little details that relate throughout the movie. I find them very pleasant and it makes the movie look rich. Nevertheless, the movie has some interesting quotes. Lastly, many characters were introduced in the story and all of those people had decisive influence to the plot. The drawback is that there were only a very brief or no insight about the reason of their relationship with Nick. Many unrevealed side stories made the film lack reason.Overall, I assigned the movie a high value mostly because of the uniqueness in the taste, feeling and because of the adequate execution of film making."
" Bland
",0.0,-0.8316,2017-08-27 00:00:00,4,"Bland. The plot is very predictable and given away completely by the trailer. Characters are annoying or lacking in depth (why even get a well known actress, Sofia Vergara, for the opening five minutes for her to never return) and the ending is just ridiculously stupid. The redeeming quality is the hand-to-hand combat. A generic Statham film, you know what you're getting."
" I would not call this an action film. It is a character study of a gambling addict who is struggling to achieve his dream, while fighting the demons of his addiction.
",-0.5106,0.2936,2017-08-06 00:00:00,7,"I don't know how ""good"" this movie is, but I found it interesting because I felt it was different. At first glance, I thought this was going to be one of those hard to follow Las Vegas action movies like ""Smokin' Aces"" (2006). It turns out the plot of this movie is really quite simple, and the movie is almost more of a character study which is unusual for an action movie of this type. Nick Wild (Jason Statham) is a bodyguard and recovering gambling addict living in Las Vegas, Nevada. His dream is to one day be wealthy enough to leave Las Vegas and sail the Mediterranean. The movie focuses on two main stories. One: Nick helps to avenge a rape victim, and two: he is hired as a bodyguard by a scrappy self made millionaire during his stay in Vegas. The movie is about Nick struggling to achieve his dream, while fighting the demons of his addiction. It also has some elements of the Aesop fable ""The Mouse and the Lion."" Jason Statham keeps a heavy English accent for this character, although there is no explanation as to how the character ended up from Britain to Las Vegas. What I found odd was that the most prominent songs in the soundtrack are Christmas songs. Although there are several other songs, ""Blue Christmas"" by Dean Martin and ""White Christmas"" by The Drifters are played loudly and in entirety. They are just not the types of songs one would expect to be in the background of the scenes in this movie. I think the reason the film has received negative reviews is because one goes into this movie looking for a Vegas action movie, and they get a character study which are movies that many people find boring‚Äîparticularly someone looking for a movie like ""21"" (2008). I thought it was good storytelling."

",0.0,-0.5338,2017-04-20 00:00:00,3,"I thought this movie was just very odd overall. Very weak motives and resolutions. The first thing I thought was..did someone make a bet to try and pass off a 12 year old's script as an actual movie? Acting was average, directing was okay, but the script was extremely weak.I'd give this one a pass unless you're a die hard Jason Statham fan. It just reminded me of something cheesy I might had written in grade school or something. Don't waste your time."
" Jason Statham Does Vegas

There is unusual depth to Jason Statham's character and Stanley Tucci plays one of the nicest, kindest, and therefore most frightening mobsters ever. But there's no great drama or great emotional impact.As an ""action thriller"" it is better than most, but the fight scenes don't measure up to ""Transporter 1"".Fine, mindless entertainment but it lacks the non-stop action of some of Mr. Statham's other films."
" Don't place a bet on this action pot boiler.....
",0.0,-0.9556,2017-02-27 00:00:00,4,"In sport if you commit an infraction you may get a red card. In my view Wild Card is a cinematic infraction. Its end to end sleaze, with a down trodden Sam Slade wannabe lead character, taking on ""da mob"" in the ghastly, garish, gambling carnival side show known as Las Vegas. In spite of Jason Statham's presence in the lead role, there's really nothing to like here. The film has a pervading sense of hopelessness and ""no-hoperiness"" about it, that's just depressing. The characters are either criminals or losers and there is not a lot in between. As such, its hard to really empathize with the key characters as their blatantly stupid, irresponsible actions, have obvious consequences. The action scenes are OK but at the same time predictable and recycled to a degree, that's simply not all that exciting. My advice, don't place a bet on this action pot boiler as its likely to disappoint. Four out of ten from me."

If you go and judge Shakespeare by his fight sequences, or a Statham movie by it's high culture, you will be disappointed in each. This movie has crisp occasionally humorous dialogue, sexy women, intense, really well choreographed fight scenes, some decent characters, and a fairly lightweight plot. There are only a few fight sequences in this 90 minute movie, but they are so good. If you look down the line, almost every Statham movie has the same rating, strengths, and complaints. If you like Statham, watch this. If you want drama, check out some re-runs of Downton Abbey, though I understand the fight sequences are terrible."
" A Couple of Likable Characters Mired in a Dismal Situation

At least he doesn't think so. Then one night when a female friend named ""Holly"" (Dominik Garc√≠a-Lorido) is brutally raped and beaten he decides to help her get revenge--even though he knows it is going cause him big trouble once everything is said and done. Even worse, this particular problem also spills over onto an innocent client by the name of ""Cyrus Kinnick"" (Michael Angarano) who has hired Nick in order to avoid trouble. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that I happened to like this film because it had a decent plot, nice action and a couple of likable characters who happen to be mired in a dismal situation and are struggling with their own insecurities and inner demons. At least, that is how it seemed to me. In any case, I thought this was an enjoyable film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
