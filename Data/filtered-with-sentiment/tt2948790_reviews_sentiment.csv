",0.0,-0.8074,2021-04-11 00:00:00,5,"The movie had a good plot and good actors, but a terrible script. The ending is a total incomprehensible and non sensical mess. A pity."
" Three stars for Rosamund and 0 for the movie
",0.0,-0.8158,2021-03-14 00:00:00,3,"The whole movie is so slow and confusing, that you really can't wait to see the end to put some sense into the movie, and then you finally arrive to the end .. and there is no end... just want to cry for the lost time ...
Ps. that one time when i should have listened to the reviews."
" Second Guesses
",0.0,-0.6249,2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"It's obvious from reading most of the reviews, even by the supposed professional critics, that they didn't understand exactly what was going on. There are several scenes where you should be asking who is plotting against whom. The tricky part is people aren't understanding that the length of the movie and storyline often confuse the actual timeline. It actually spans several years, not just a few Months that people seem to think. Overall if you open your mind and pay attention, it's actually a fairly decent movie."
" Unexpected revenge movie..!!
",-0.6103,-0.902,2021-02-27 00:00:00,6,"A lady was raped by a bad guy then he went to jail..but she has to visit him regularly and being good with him..lateron after he came out from jail she offers a painting job in her house... But suddenly she takes revenge on him and operated his genital part..
It seems quite boring and one time watchable movie.."
" Thanx Solmack: yep. A lot better than most people realise.
",0.6249,-0.3423,2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"Solmack... so glad you took the time to write ""Underrated"" in may 2016, bcoz i watched this movie yesterday, and everyone else's review was so w.a.c.k.
i couldn't believe they'd missed so much of what i'd seen, then i read your brief summary...the film is about a nurse who is OCD and a very patient psychopath, who apparently admits that she killed her mother when she was young right before her latest victim sees wat she did to him!
i guess if you aren't paying attention then you won't see how controlled and obsessive she is. each element of her life must be reconsidered at several points in the move, refitting the puzzle as each clue about her is revealed."
" It's a far cry from ""Gone Girl"".
",-0.4767,0.5574,2021-01-05 00:00:00,5,"A traumatized nurse (Rosamund Pike) hatches an elaborate revenge scheme against the man (Shiloh Fernandez) who raped her on a blind date.I only decided to watch this film on Amazon Prime quite simply because of Rosamund Pike - her performance in ""Gone Girl"" is fantastic and it's one of my favourite films. ""Return to Sender"" however suffers under bad writing and an unsatisfactory plot-twist seen from miles away. However, that doesn't detract from Pike's performance. In fact, with the lack of suspense, the ball is entirely in her court. She plays it beautifully and is bizarrely compelling despite how under-written her character is. But this slow-burn female payback thriller deserved better. Pike's performance makes this film digestible, but also makes us yearn for her to receive better roles in the future."
" WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME A MOVIE MADE YOU THINK SO MUCH?
",0.0,-0.9848,2020-12-23 00:00:00,7,"SPOILER ALERT: If you are a fan of Rosamund Pike and will watch this movie anyway, stop reading right now.It's an intriguing movie. And difficult to watch, especially the scenes where she starts meeting her rapist and looks like she's empathizing with him. It's difficult to watch because you don't really know in which direction it's going.But then you learn that she's a psycho. She killed her mother and her father's dog. So, is she seeing a kindred spirit in the rapist?Nope. Once she traps him in her house and surgically removes his hand, you realize this is a revenge movie.At the end of the movie she informs her father that William the rapist will not be coming to the house anymore. It can only mean three things:1. She's let him go and he's so scared he won't come back. Probably the least acceptable explanation.
2. She's killed him. Quite likely.
3. She has him permanently trapped in her house and will spend the next few months or years surgically removing his body parts one by one.Given that she's a complete psycho, I'd go with No. 3.When was the last time a movie made you think so hard. I give it 7 stars."
" A mess of a movie
",-0.3612,-0.9184,2020-10-19 00:00:00,2,"Reading the blurb I thought I was in for a revenge, or overcoming a trauma kind of movie. Nope! This is an utter mess of a film. Couldn't get my head round the behaviour. And what a waste of Camryn Manheim.
Avoid. Not one redeeming feature."
" bring a bucket of brain bleach
",0.0,-0.8252,2020-09-26 00:00:00,2,"This isn't a good movie. It's about a woman who experiences a horrifying trauma and loses her effing mind. The first 30 minutes or so establish her as someone who has a touch of OCD or is maybe a bit on the spectrum before the inciting event occurs and changes her life. Unfortunately, the event is shown in graphic detail, which I frankly wish had not been the case because I felt nauseous afterwards for several hours. I cannot overstate how graphic and ugly the scene is.Anyway, after what happens happens, she begins acting in an extremely unusual way, which worries her friends and family. I'm not entirely sure what the movie was aiming for, exactly, as there is not really any big reveal or surprise that wasn't shown in detail on the movie box, so there really isn't any tension. Even if they didn't give away the store on the movie cover, it should be extremely obvious to any viewer exactly what she's doing. The only people who don't know what's going on are the other characters in the movie, because otherwise everything would fall apart.Even after the climactic moments of the film are over, the movie ends feeling a little like they just ran out of funds and had to stop filming. There isn't really an end so much as just a fade to black with a bunch of loose threads left unresolved. I got this movie by accident; Amazon sent me this movie instead of the movie I actually ordered, and didn't bother to even ask for it back because shipping was more than the film was worth, but even free I regret losing the time I spent watching it. Do not watch this film."
" a movie about overcoming tragedy
",-0.6597,0.9325,2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,"Read a few reviews before watching and had to laugh at the usual slow burners, and watch it myself.
its not a dull boring dragged out ""slow burn"" not in the slightest, it is however a story of a woman that has been raped,
The slow burn brigade are miraculous, what do they want? the film to start and end with no story in betwixt? this isnt and wasnt meant to be car chases and explosions or wolverine stabbing folk with his magic fingernails! it is a budding hospital worker that gets raped, the rapist gets the jail, then we see her story, her story of getting through her ordeal the only way she knows, the way she thinks best, its a story of how her friends and family cope with her ordeal - especially her father (nick nolte, who stole the show) ,i dont want to go any further with the story (not slow burn) than i have, it will give too much away.
the acting is great , casting is on point, story is totally amazing, and a delicious twist at the end.i have learnt a valuable lesson on imDb with this movie, ignore any wannabe critic that uses ""slow burn"" to review a title.its not the last house on the left, spit on your grave or even hard candy, BUT it is well worth a watch and a very satisfying piece of cinema!"
" This is weird...
",0.0,0.9276,2020-05-22 00:00:00,4,"It begins in a somehow childish construction that already within the first minute of the movie makes you wonder what great actors like Nick Nolte are doing in a film like this. But then you remind yourself of endless movie titles, where famous actors have said ""yes"" without even reading the script (as a film director myself I know what I am talking about).But then the story, the film comes together. It seems plausible and entertaining and you begin to enjoy it (well, I did)... And I enjoyed it all the way to the end... Ahh, the end... The end somehow lives up to the promises of the beginning of the film. A horrible ending. Well, let me be honest. This film doesn't have a real ending. No, seriously, it has no ending. I wanted to explain something else when I started writing this review, but now I suddenly realized that it doesn't have an ending. Period. Full stop.How could the director, the producer, the film company, the distributor, let this film go out to the world without an ending? Please someone, seriously, explain that to me?????"
" Quiet thriller in comparison to others of this genre
",0.1027,-0.9913,2020-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Rosamund Pike was brilliant in Return to Sender. That is what sustained me through watching this movie. She is a fascinating character. It got too late at night to watch anymore after about an hour in, but I really looked forward to returning to it throughout the next day. When I did I was a little disappointed, but overall I'm still really glad I watched it. 'Revenge' is the last word mentioned on the blurb on the back of the dvd. Yes, ultimately, it is a revenge movie, but it is an immeasurably quieter version than, say, I Spit On Your Grave (2010), a movie that rivalled Saw (2004) for intensity, cruelty and violence. I Spit On Your Grave was an almost unwatchable graphic representation of a rape and subsequent revenge. Return To Sender's aims are far more realistic and believable, not to mention way less graphic, a sort of tragic and odd confluence of factors that lead to an unusual woman taking an unusual revenge. You sympathise with her, and after the movie feel a delicious conflicting of emotions as to whether the path she took was one you would approve of. I guess that was the point of the movie, and, for me, it is a controversy that is worthy of praise. If you are after a rollicking 'revenge' movie however, well, there are many more out there way more graphic than this one. In this one you can see the revenge coming, but it doesn't arrive until perhaps an hour after the rape. Return To Sender is after an audience that appreciates the true consequences of a rape and how it can have devastate, and how it can have more consequences than you might expect. And in this regard, and as a low budget movie that is purely character driven, Return To Sender certainly succeeds."
" Pike is good
",0.4404,-0.4829,2019-12-20 00:00:00,4,"Not the best to sit thru. The best m9ments were the last 15 minutes or about. Nolte did his thing well,but thats about all The positive points about this movie"
" A huge disappointment
",-0.25,0.986,2019-04-10 00:00:00,5,"No spoilers:I am going to keep this brief because truthfully there isn't much to say. I decided to watch this film because after having never known of Rosamund Pike before I quickly fell in love with her and her acting after having seen the amazing film Gone Girl. I didn't go into this film thinking it would be like Gone Girl despite still having a desire for more of that type of film. I just wanted to see more of Rosamund and her acting and what other types of films she has been in. It starts off really promising, but rather quickly takes a nose dive. There was a surprise or two and it actually had great potential, but it was wasted potential. The acting is good, the cinematography is good, but the story left a lot to be desired. That's all I can say to avoid spoilers. Despite my feelings I never tell people not to watch a film because what I don't like someone else might really enjoy and vice versa. If you are a Rosamund fan or just curious about this film then give it a look."
" Return to Sender - An Appropriate Title
",0.0,0.9305,2019-04-04 00:00:00,2,"I like Rosamund Pike. She is intelligent, good-looking and sexy, and an excellent actress. The problem is, however, we are always aware that she is acting and she never gets into character. All her film personas have zero character development. Meryl Streep, on the other hand, submerges herself completely into the character she is playing, and you have no sense at all that she is acting; she IS the character. Rosamund cannot do that; for all her talent, she seems to refuse to surrender herself to any character of any film. She is always Rosamund Pike. She is a lot like John Wayne in that regard. It really didn't matter what role John Wayne was playing; he was always John Wayne. Rosamund Pike is the female version of John Wayne. This film was trite and a waste of time, but I really do hope to see her capture a character some day; like Charlize Theron in Monster or Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth."
" Really awful
",-0.5095,-0.4135,2018-10-08 00:00:00,3,"Between the unlikeable characters, bad acting, and horrible plot I cannot believe this was even in the theaters! WOW"
" Very dull
",-0.4576,-0.8705,2018-08-23 00:00:00,1,The movie was very bad and boring. I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching it!
" Weak and uneventful plots
",-0.4404,-0.1779,2018-07-16 00:00:00,6,"About the failure of this movie, it did not have right surroundings , atmosphere and actors among others. It's way too clean to be a thriller.The title did not set off audience's alarm, either. It could be a good thriller. Rosamund Pike did a decent performance as a psychopathic nurse. Without her involvement, this movie might be unwatchable. Good thrillers are about the senses of surroundings. Waiting for something terrible happened, then catastrophes followed. This one had little to do on that front. Graphic images are low tech for thrillers. They are supposed to bring scare moments to audiences. This movie should be redone in the future. I believe the contents were applicable and original. Lacking efforts weakened this supposedly good thriller."
" Horrible
",-0.5423,-0.986,2018-07-07 00:00:00,1,"A misantropic film, where even the dog is regarded as evil.Something is very wrong when you wish the rapist had kill the 'victim'.In many flicks like this, rape is just an excuse some women have to go on a killing spree, like an anger against all men waiting just the right excuse.The rapist was convicted, and had paid his time in jail, so he was innocent.This movie is pretty much feminist propaganda like 'kill all men'.Acting and directing was not particular great, too slow at times."
" Incredulous plot with good acting
",0.4404,-0.7814,2018-06-02 00:00:00,6,"An attractive small town nurse is raped in her house after she is confused about her blind date. Then, the story turns about her struggle with the trauma and loses its initial tempo. The plot also gets incredulous in this part. The end comes with a predictable twist. Good acting from R. Pike and N. Nolte while S. Fernandez's acting seems a bit theatrical with his smirky face all along as if to remind us that he's the bad guy who never gets rehabilitated. All in all, a decent but forgettable project."
" Disconnected
",0.0,-0.8553,2018-03-19 00:00:00,4,Slow paced and disconnected in parts. Poor sound on prison scenes was quite annoying.
" Crazy suggest I don't know right from wrong
",-0.6705,-0.9769,2018-02-14 00:00:00,6,"Miranda (Rosamund Pike) is a small town nurse and cake decorator. She is cool, calm, and calculating and lives alone. She is overly occupied with the thoughts of germs, and dreads sharing a pen. Her friend hooks her up with a blind date (her ex). By coincidence another man, William Finn (Shiloh Fernandez) shows up at her door and rapes her. The only way things could get worse is if her dad was Nick Nolte. with a dog..and it was.William goes to prison and Miranda has trouble functioning as a twitch has developed in her hand. Strangely, the distressed victim visits her attacker in prison, apparently some kind of odd therapy.For some reason I didn't see the overly predictable end coming. Rosamund gave us an excellent performance in a what qualifies as a low budget ""B"" drama/thriller.Guide: F-bomb, rape (from behind and brief)"
" Nope. A waste of time
",0.3252,-0.9936,2017-10-08 00:00:00,4,"I don't know why I even started watching this movie. First, I can barely tolerate Rosamund Pike. She comes off as a snotty ice princess in everything she plays. She seems to have no range, unable to give any other type of performance other than cold, bored, elitist. And then, THEN, she says she killed her father's dog??? Why the hell do people insist on killing animals just to further a boring plot-line? The man that raped her is one of those carved in stone sleazy, disgusting bullies that always kills, rapes, or somehow brutalizes women. The movie was predictable and the actors so dyed in the wool bad, I fast-forwarded through some of it. Nick Nolte was wasted in this movie."
" flat TV movie level
",0.0,-0.9513,2017-09-23 00:00:00,4,"Miranda Wells (Rosamund Pike) is a hospital nurse. Her friends set her up on a blind date. She finds William Finn (Shiloh Fernandez) on her door step and assumes him to be her date. She lets him in and he rapes her. The police later catches him. She is told that her rape has made it hard to sell her house. Her hands start shaking and she can't advance to be a surgical nurse. Her nice persona changes and she writes a letter to William in prison. It is sent back with Return to Sender. Mitchell Wells (Nick Nolte) is her father and Nancy (Camryn Manheim) is her best friend co-worker.Fouad Mikati's directions are only TV movie level. It's a waste of cinematic level talents of the cast. I have no complaint about the cast but it doesn't rise up to their level. It's also not comparable to Lifetime movies or anything of that sort. It is really disconcerting to see talents wasted this way. One of my pet peeves is the metallic echo when they speak to each other over the prison phones. It's one of the wrong choices that keep this movie down. It's too static with much of the time spent in that prison visiting booth. Any shocking descent is flattened by that stationary camera work. By the time he gets out, the movie is two thirds over and I stop caring about the rest. There is an obvious twist that is done much better in Hard Candy. This would be a good Twilight Zone or a horror TV episode. It's not cinematic enough to be theatrical."
" Expected this, got that
",0.0,-0.6858,2017-05-23 00:00:00,6,"I will skip the synopsis, since, if you are reading this, you probably already know the setup.This film has some twists up its sleeve and there's nothing in the tone to telegraph them, yet all the clues have been laid out in advance and all the dots connect. Until the last 15 minutes, I kept wondering where this was going to go; there was a creepy, uncomfortable vibe to the way the relationship between Miranda (Pike) and the convicted-and-released rapist (Shiloh Fernandez) developed.This is no classic, but it's a decently-crafted piece of entertainment that is by turns disturbing, creepy and satisfying. Everyone involved turns in at the least a workmanlike job and, in the case of Pike, a mildly inspired turn.Rosamund Pike has an intense, frightening gaze. Her irises are so dark that they merge with her pupils, making for an all black center to her eyes in many shots. It makes her expression hard to read and gives her a menacing, almost-reptilian quality at times. In opposition to actors whose performances lay bare their emotions or whose mannerisms reveal the inner workings of their minds, hers is opaque and difficult to read.Compared to the entirety of the film and television I have seen in my life, I'd put this in the top 40th percentile. If you think this is a ""worst of all time"" contender, you clearly haven't seen enough movies."
" I'm shocked at low ratings
",-0.5267,-0.9955,2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"This is the first time I've written a review and don't be fooled I like a good rant. This is a deep review... I honestly cannot understand all these poor ratings and a previous comment ""why did she kill the dog?"" ... Really?! I shouldn't have to explain but clearly I do... she slowly poisoned her dads dog testing how much she could give it without killing it. I mean really, how hard is that? Anyway that annoyance aside, the rape scene was brutal, full on and much more graphic than we wanted it to be, it shocked you, it was meant to. Don't dumb down the rest of the film and Rosamund Pike's performance because you didn't like being shown something horrifying and REAL. I have to say unless you have been through any kind of abuse yourself, you would think this movie and the acting ""wooden"" ""unnatural"" and blah blah blah... I'm not saying it's perfect, there's some dodgy camera work and uncomfortable acting mainly from Shiloh Fernandez but cut the guy some slack he was playing a rapist. He's human, just like this film is. In the end you should feel cold, just like she did."
" An Oscar Winner For Sure!
",0.75,-0.9099,2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"And the Oscar for the worst sound recording/editing goes to... this incomprehensible mess.Why the distorted whispering that is completely unintelligible? Why didn't they re-process or re-shoot the scenes in the jail when they are mumbling in whispers on the telephones? Does the director actually think people can understand what they are saying? It's not like we viewers have a script to follow. This film needs subtitles in 70% of the scenes.As for the plot, well, if only Ms. Pike had shown a bit more flesh it might have been worth watching, but as it is, it is a complete waste of time.Sorry Ms Pike, you were wasted on this."
" I like it.
",0.3612,0.8719,2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,"I like this movie very much. I think it deserves 7 points at least.Maybe the reason why its underrated is because Miranda poisoned her father's dog. That might hurt the feeling of quite a lot of dog-people.I agree that it is not suitable for everyone. From the ""general public"" view, Miranda might be a psychopath, who ""let her mother die"" and poisoned her father's dog. But I think she is strong, smart, and full of courage. She successfully did what people want to but dare not to. She's some sort of ""super-woman"". The movie heals the depression deep inside.Besides, I am a coward guy but I was not raped."
" But Oh, Could She Decorate A Cake!
",0.0,0.9803,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"This isn't a movie for everybody. But then neither was 'Taxi Driver'. Great actors, even good ones, are able to capture your attention in such a way that there is no before or after, there is just the here and now. (That's why Robert Deniro gets to play mob guys all the time.) It's also why Rosamund Pike gets to play ""bunny boilers"". She's great at it. Scary great at it. Why she chooses to is another question? Pike is enchanting as the beautiful self possessed Miranda. Think 'Grace Kelly' without the restrictions of the Hays code. But she is a fantasy in the Hollywood mode because there are hints that Miranda is flawed, maybe broken, and therefore, in spite of her dark eyed beauty, class and brilliance, available to us. She seduces recklessly and knowingly but without agenda. Miranda does not need to be saved. This leads to trouble of course and the trouble that comes is startlingly harsh and ugly, but then so is Miranda's path to restorative justice."
