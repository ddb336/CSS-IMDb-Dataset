" Honest, One of the Worst Assassin Movie Out There
",-0.2023,0.9733,2021-03-07 00:00:00,3,"While the high tech robbery at the beginning of the movie was cool, it seemed artificial in part because for all of its sophistication, one would expect just to gas all the customers and put them to sleep, more robbers would need to be involved to rob this bank, the professional would be slightly more professional (even understandably the need for some sloppiness), the advanced security system would likely be housed in a much more elite bank or security building, and what was stolen would be much more valuable than several hundred thousand dollars. The opening sequence however did have some excellent qualities, a nice size tip and exploding van, and the process of the robbery itself was scripted and handled well even if the characters were somewhat less than convincing. Typical of a lesser quality movie, the director as a first time to helm a movie chose to overtly exercise unnecessarily the sexiness of the lead feminine character early on in the movie, perhaps in a sign of insecurity on the part of the director or producers. Olga Kurylenko appears also to have been too roughly scripted as a character in the beginning portion of the movie instead of a more sophisticated suave, cooler, appealing character, this isn't a Nikita (1990). Another glaring weakness is the apparent disregard of having her masked hood taken off during the robbery and her failure to come up with a disguise to avoid being recognized which the televised version of Nikita (2010) or Alias (2001) did very well. Overall the characters as portrayed just so seem inauthentic enough to have come up with and pulled off this kind of robbery giving the beginning portion of the movie a dazzling display but an artificial and amateur one. A good example of a great comparison with this movie is the entertaining and delightful comedic assassin movie Mr. Right (2015) and Tim Roth's cool and collected demeanor during the opening sequence of that movie too. Having these early characters possess more professionalism would actually have enhanced what comes next making the subsequent set of events even more terrifying and a more threatening antagonist. But then comes some really terrible, unrealistic series of scenes almost already 30 minutes into the film.Hopefully the movie gets much, much better but it gets worse. There are a few legitimate attempts to make a better assassin movie, but they fall flat. There's even a prominent Nikita or Point of No Return (1993) escape on display. Olga Kurylenko's character just comes across too frightened and scared, frantic most of the time to really rank among the elite of assassins (just even compare Daryl Hannah in The Job (2003) or even Geena Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996). Then there's the skybridge from the laundry room scene and an unconvincing prolonged chase scene along with idiotic distracted driving and no seat belts, a poor script device ploy as well as poor role model (compared to Taron Egerton's driving Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014). At times, one might just want to put a bullet into Olga's head just to end watching the movie and just re-watch Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State (1998). The movie script and direction continues to descend into typical average melodrama that detracts from the crisp qualitative promise of the original premise of this movie. The effort of some light-hearted comedy isn't a bad choice here and the script is let down by the director. Additionally, the scriptwriters Adam Marcus and Debra Sullivan attempt to incorporate what they believe are unique different concepts to add to the tension to the movie with various telephone calls, dripping blood, broken windows, a little boy that just simply manages to walk off, and extended fight scenes thrown in that should have been or could have been finished quickly. All these little additions that are supposed to contribute to the overall thrills to the movie. But in reality these screenwriters don't have the experience nor sophistication to pull it off and their results come off manipulated, unnatural, and forced, such as bargaining away for stolen items for something that might even be more valuable and talking on the phone while in the middle of a potentially lethal situation and a mystery person (Frank) that just jumps out of nowhere, than instead of continuing the action the movie stalls for a supposedly sentimental and engaging story told by the antagonist (reasonably good concept but poorly placed and executed) that really doesn't add much to the movie except to slow it down to a boringly tedious pace (how dumb are these ideas?). The protagonist has so many opportunities to just end the movie or even the other characters have ways to exit the movie convincingly, but the writers have run out of ideas and need to keep writing to make the plot into a full-length feature movie. By trying to be different and fancy, these screenwriters actually make the movie worse than it might have been, not better. The director even if he had been a good one would have struggled to clean up this mess that includes ""professionals"" who don't know that they're being followed. The supposedly physical big climatic scene was ultimately unconvincing though a huge amount of convoluted storytelling went into it (contrast this with much better made and slickly accomplished Lucky Number Slevin (2006)). After everything is said and done, the movie ends without actually tying up the biggest twist and surprise of the movie. The scriptwriters wrote an overblown movie without a satisfying ending. Overall, this is one instance of great marketing trailer that makes the actual movie much more riveting that it actually is. The advertising agency should be commended to the detriment of those that have spent more money to see this movie than it was worth. Olga Kurylenko deserved a better movie than this to star in, the writers and director let her down."
" Very Good Movie
",0.4927,0.8701,2021-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Very Good Movie, I'm waiting for the 2nd part.Olga Kurylenko does an outstanding job playing
the part.Wish the movie was longer to see what happens once plane lands at end.
It is nice seeing Morgan Freeman play the bad guy.
The action and suspense is top notch. But I never understand why she would
wear fancy lace undies while in combat mode. But I guess I'm not a woman so I
would not understand that part of it.After seeing movies makes me want to look for movies she is in.I really enjoyed the movie. 9 out of 10."

This is a good popcorn VOD movie."

Action packed from start to finish. Just wished they would have made a sequel to it. Well done throughout and recommend it to those who love a great story line and action. Never seen anything advertised in theaters about this movie.

",-0.3612,-0.6765,2020-11-01 00:00:00,2,Not believable for a second.Spastic camera work does nothing to help anyone believe this cast of milk toasts could rob a senior center let alone a bank. That's even with the poorly conceived wanna be futuristic get ups. Purfoy is as convincing a baddie as my grandmother's chi hua hua.What a colossal waste of money.Two stars for the ever so infinitesimal bit of production value tucked away here and there.

" Not a bad watch
",0.431,-0.031,2020-08-23 00:00:00,5,"It's no John Wick or Taken in terms of action but I found it watchable mainly because of a charismatic villain who likes to wax poetic before fighting. He talks like the villain in the first Equalizer movie. It's kinda like Salt in terms of story and entertainment meaning it's watchable but not great. The thing is I didn't get bored which is more than I can say with many movies where I just turn off in a few minutes if it doesn't pull me in. Olga Kurylenko has another ex secret agent movie that I think is better and more action packed, the Courier. Check it out."

" Momentum
",0.0,-0.9288,2020-06-23 00:00:00,5,"I was attracted to this independent film because of the three leading names in the cast, and it was said to be violent, so I was up for seeing both. Basically, Alexis ""Alex"" Faraday (Olga Kurylenko) is a mysterious trained ex-military agent-turned-thief. She is pulled in by a former partner for one last heist, to steal diamonds from a safe deposit box in Cape Town. The gang of four robbers succeed in the theft, but the heist goes awry, when Alex's mask is pulled off, with many of the bank customers and staff as witnesses, and one of the criminals is murdered in the struggle. Alex goes into hiding, but she realises the robbery was not just about the diamonds, as the safe deposit box contained a much more valuable flash drive containing incriminating evidence. It contains the evil scheme by an anonymous Senator (Morgan Freeman) that will cause devastation to the United States. The senator sends a team of agents, led by master assassin Mr. Washington (James Purefoy), to retrieve the flash drive. Alex does everything she can to escape the criminals pursuing her in a series of frenetic cat-and-mouse chases across the city. Alex unintentionally gets people close to her involved but helps them to escape the criminals. She is captured and tortured to give up the flash drive in exchange for the diamonds, but it takes a long while before she seemingly gives in. It all comes to a head at the airport, as the police also get involved to catch Alex, but she manages to defeat Mr. Washington and his gang. Alex calls the senator to reveal that she knows his plan, but his right-hand Doug MacArthur (Karl Thaning) answers, but the senator will do whatever it takes to track her down. Also starring Hlomla Dandala as Mr. Madison, Brendan Sean Murray as Raymond ""Ray"" Kelly, and Shelley Nicole as Ms. Clinton. Kurylenko gives a terrific performance as the mastermind anti-hero, while Freeman does almost nothing that interesting, but for me it was Purefoy that stole the show with his great performance as the intelligent criminal chasing her, often complimenting her whilst trying to get the better of her. You can almost forget about the political conspiracy plot, and just concentrate on the well-edited, fast-paced chase sequences, filled with a good amount of crashes and explosions, with some bloody and tense moments as well. It's not necessarily that engaging all the time, a film that feels like it's something you've seen before, but it is stylish enough to keep you watching, a reasonable action thriller. Worth watching!"

It's 90 minutes of non stop action with well filmed and violent fight scenes and a fun plot, Olga is an unstoppable badass who is always one step ahead of the badguys and it's really entertaining. This is definitely a B-movie and is pretty silly but everyone plays it completely straight which makes it all the more fun.
James Purefoy is hilarious as the scenery chewing badguy, you can tell the actors had a good time making this movie.
It's not going to win any awards but if you want a straight forward and exciting action movie then check this out."

As such its good enough. Sure, the plot is thin. Sure, the dialogues are predictable. Sure, the bad guys have the obligated looks and accent. Sure, it has flaws. But it delivers what you might hope for: speed, action, a car chase, gunfights, a good looking heroin (Olga Kurylenko's acting was not half as bad as I feared) It even has some suspence, a few twists and as a bonus a small role for Morgan Freeman. It will not win prices but it's a fun movie to watch on a rainy day."

",-0.1531,0.5875,2018-03-21 00:00:00,6,"MOMENTUM is a modern-day action thriller with a female lead and plenty of action to see it through. It was shot in a nice-looking South Africa by a first-time director and it did very badly on release at the box office, although I'm not too sure why. I suspect that the appetite for straight action movies has disappeared these days as people turn to superhero flicks and other outlandish variants for their thrills. Me, I prefer a good BOURNE-style thriller any day of the week and MOMENTUM did the trick for me. It's obviously been made on a limited budget so it's a surprise that the explosive action really hits home and provides all the necessary excitement. With this and THE NOVEMBER MAN Olga Kurylenko proves that she's got what it takes to lead a thriller, although the real stand-out here is James Purefoy's urbane villain who seems to be modelled on his role in THE FOLLOWING. Purefoy is a delight and adds plenty of wry humour to his part. Morgan Freeman is wasted and some of the plotting is a little routine, but otherwise this is a cat-and-mouse thriller that delivers the goods."
" lackluster
",0.0,-0.9001,2017-07-26 00:00:00,4,"Alexis Farraday (Olga Kurylenko) gets pulled into another job by her running mate Kevin Fuller. It's a bank heist to steal diamonds. Alexis gets unmasked in a fight against one of the robbery crew. Mr. Washington (James Purefoy) hired by a Senator (Morgan Freeman) comes looking not just for the diamonds but a computer drive. He kills Fuller but Alexis escapes with the drive.The story is simple. It relies on action and not much else. It's alright for a 90's gun fight action film. The action is done well enough. There is a good variety of gun, hand-to-hand, and car chases. It needs more in terms of dialog and characterization. The writing is lackluster. Kurylenko is still not the best actress around and struggles to be the lead. Campanelli is trying make the jump from camera operator to director. A simple thing like more specificity to Freeman's character would help. The movie often stalls when the action gets stuck in one location. It becomes static especially for an action movie. The camera work may be correct but the directing is unimaginative."
" Better than Expected
",0.4404,-0.9217,2017-01-30 00:00:00,7,"Good movie with plenty of action. Olga Kurylenko is believable in the lead role, although the characters abilities are inconsistent and I found some of her actions frustrating and silly. There was no reason to allow herself to be caught in order to draw them to the airport. A phone call offering the drive would have done that.The villains are suitably evil and James Purefoy is a convincing psychopathic criminal. I did think that the over use of the F word was unnecessary. It seems a trend to over use bad language in action movies which is sloppy script writing in my opinion.The ending left this open to a series of sequels so maybe there are more to come?"
" Solid action if a bit confused at times
",-0.1779,-0.9911,2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"This South African action film opens in Cape Town where a gang of thieves are robbing a bank; this isn't a smash and grab raid but a highly professional job targeting a specific box in the vault. It doesn't go according to plan though when one of the thieves fall out another member; the dispute leaves him dead and other thief, Alexis Farraday, with her face exposed to witnesses. It soon becomes apparent that is the least of her worries; as well as the diamonds in the box they also took a flash drive which contains damning evidence against a US senator who has some highly unpleasant people, led by Mr. Washington, on the scene to get it back for him. Washington kills Kevin Fuller, one of robbers, while trying to extract information for him, not knowing that Alexis is in the room. She manages to get away and we get a cat and mouse chase as first they chase after her then, after Washington learns the location of the Fuller's wife and child, Alexis then rushes to protect them. As the film progresses there are several confrontations between Alexis and Washington and his people and ultimately she learns the secret people are more than willing to kill for.There are plenty of action thrillers that are much better than this but there are also plenty that are worse. On the positive side the action is pretty good, there is plenty of tension from start to finish and the scenes that are meant to make the viewer wince really do. Olga Kurylenko does a fine job in the lead role and James Purefoy is suitably unpleasant as Mr Washington. Morgan Freeman's brief appearance as 'The Senator' is good but his role is fairly small. On the downside some things are far-fetched even for the action genre; characters manage to get to locations at just the right/wrong time so they keep meeting and at one point Alexis uses a bomb and there is no explanation where it came from. The finale is a little disappointing too as it felt more like a teaser for another film rather than proper ending. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre if it on TV or in the DVD bargain bin but it is hardly a must see."
