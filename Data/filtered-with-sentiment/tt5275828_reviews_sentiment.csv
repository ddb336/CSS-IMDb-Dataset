" Werner Herzog Sings The Body Electric: His documentary Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World
",0.0,0.9988,2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,"This article""Werner Herzog Sings The Body Electric: His new documentary Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World"" was published September , 2016 at CINEMATICA, the blog associated with The Screening Room in Kingston, Ontario. Here is a link to the original article.""I sing the body electric,
The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.""
Walt WhitmanWerner Herzog is the internationally lauded and immensely prolific filmmaker who directed the documentaries Grizzly Man (2005) and Cave of Forgotten Dreams (a 2010 3D celebration of the Chauvet cave containing ancient on its walls in France); and a raft of raw, intense, heavy fictional films, including Queen of the Desert (a 2015 film starring Nicole Kidman about the adventurer/write Gertrude Bell), Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009), Fitzcarraldo (1982), and Aguirre: The Wrath of God (1977). Of the over fifty films he's made (and counting) many are considered among the finest films every made. Herzog is also a steady and hard-working director in the world of opera and theatre, a writer and poet, and an actor. He has started his own film school and is a generous and tireless pedagogue who uses any and all opportunities to teach others what he knows and what he believes is important. Of all the things he does, Herzog says that the prose and poetry he has written probably has deeper and lasting cultural relevance than anything, including any of his films and he speaks frequently about the importance of fostering the poetic spirit for any kind of artistic endeavour, including and especially filmmaking.A discussion of his work must also include this director's ""true grit"" and his restless preference for most extreme settings, most extreme physical feats (usually of endurance) whilst filmmaking, and most extreme subject matter. The appreciation of Herzog's poetic spirit and his spectacularly adventurous and extremes-seeking nature, I think, is part of what binds Herzog's fans to him, of which there are many. Francois Truffaut, himself acknowledged as one of the greatest, called him ""the most important film director alive."" With his characteristic stark acknowledgement of reality and bravado Werner Herzog also joins the expression of enthusiasm of his own talents. When attending a forum at the Producers Guild of America in conjunction with the release of Lo and Behold, Herzog said: ""I believe that not only was I the best choice for this: I was the only choice."" He cited his curiosity and the fact that he is a vast reader and says this makes him a critical and conceptual thinker adequate for the task of considering the internet at its impact on humanity. I think Herzog's relative unfamiliarity with the internet and his unusual upbringing in a remote German village without any running water, electricity, or telephones make him a unique candidate to lead an investigation into the most significant and far-reaching technological development of our time. He's after all in the position of witnessing our rapid unfolding of technological advancement because he realizes what it is like to live with the very basic level of technology that most of humanity experienced for most of history. To a person who made his first phone call at the age of 19 as Herzog did, the last 80 years of developments in technology must seem all part of the same wonder - or more exactly rephrased - they must seem all part of the wonder that they truly are. Indeed, the lofty and prophetic title of this film Lo and Behold is meant to underscore the wondrousness of the subject matter and to acknowledge the actual and important dawning of a vastly unique era for humanity. It's also referring to ""LO"" the first internet message ever sent in UCLA in 1969, which was going to be ""LOG"" before an unexpected failure of the equipment.At the time of the release of Lo and Behold Werner Herzog called himself a beginner with regard to the technology about which he was reflecting. ""I understand the basics conceptually but I'm still a novice,"" he said about his facility with the internet at the Producer's Guild of America. During an interview with Ben Makuch of VICE Herzog entertainingly and with self-awareness revealed his at-the-time patchy knowledge about the internet. He recounts to Makuch that after having participated in a podcast someone suggested that he google it once it was posted, to which Herzog asked how he would ""hack"" into Google to do such a thing and how for minutes afterward the room was seized hopelessly with irrepressible and wordless fits of laughter. No one who has ever used Google would refer to the act in that manner. It's clear that embarking on this project Herzog was secure in what is actually his historically and perennially preferred filmmaking perspective: that of being a stranger in a strange land. I hope now that this film has been made, Werner Herzog can take time to explore the internet and discover how he really feels about it when it's up close and a daily facet of his life. Although I'm sure he believes his ""fresh eyes"" approach served his purposes, I'm curious about what he would actually think about his subject if he had the same level of usership on it as someone like me, and how he would specifically feel about Facebook and Twitter and Youtube etc. if he were to actually know them and experience them on a daily basis. He made it clear in his VICE interview that he is aware that there are Twitter and Facebook accounts under his name, but that they are made by ""imposters"" and not authorized by him.Throughout the film, Herzog's conversation perspectives of the internet are only representative of a technical or scientific view of the internet (curiously heavy on nightmare science-fiction scenerios) or with those highly-antagonistic to the internet. The personal opinion that Herzog in the end seems to convey is that the internet may be a miracle, but that it may be just as well avoided altogether. I can detect from watching interviews about this film that at times Herzog seemed pleased in some ways to be so far away from the enchantment and - for himself and his work - still largely living in a pre-internet environment of his own preservation.This project began when the production company Netscout offered him a commission to do five short films about the internet. Herzog says it became clear within days that the scope of the project would be much larger. He says that Netscout easily assented to all expansion and to his delight, continued to give him freedom to pursue it in any way he pleased. His modus operandi was to set up a series of meetings with experts and interesting characters. He admits that in general he shoots relatively little footage compared with other filmmakers for any project he embarks upon. In the end this time he shot about 28 hours of footage mostly in Los Angeles and Chicago and Pittsburgh to make the finished product of 1 hour 38 minutes. About his methods for capturing good footage quickly, he explained in his talk at The Producer's Guild of America (whose audience was populated with many young filmmakers) that in all the films in which he uses ""talking heads"" footage, he that he doesn't do interviews, but he ""conducts conversations."" He does not have a catalogue of questions and likes to arrive completely unprepared. He gets a quick sense of the person he's dealing with and forms a natural rapport. Herzog emphasizes that in order to be able to have a rapport with others they must be worldly and to read widely: ""You learn about the world and reading that gives you access to the rapport and thoughtfulness. If you want to learn how to do it - have real conversations with real people, expose yourself to the world where it is raw stark-naked and intense. That will make it easy for you to have a decent conversation on camera.""The students in his charge at his film school, Rogue Film School (est. 2009) are probably well-used to such admonishments. According to Wikipedia ""The program is a 4-day seminar with Herzog, which occurs annually (the last of which was held in March, 2016 in Munich). Courses include ""the art of lockpicking. Traveling on foot. The exhilaration of being shot at unsuccessfully. The athletic side of filmmaking. The creation of your own shooting permits. The neutralization of bureaucracy. Guerrilla tactics. Self reliance."" For the students, Herzog has said, ""I prefer people who have worked as bouncers in a sex club, or have been wardens in the lunatic asylum. You must live life in its very elementary forms. The Mexicans have a very nice word for it: pura vida. It doesn't mean just purity of life, but the raw, stark-naked quality of life. And that's what makes young people more into a filmmaker than academia."" In an appearance on a UK television debate program called Intelligence Squared Herzog states: ""The poet, the filmmaker, the musician... must not avert his eyes. We should not be sitting in the library and study it as an academic subject. I think the poet has to live a real, solid, pure, raw life out there in life itself."" He goes onto say that the poet must even observe and try to understand all aspects of culture - even the most base and vulgar.In this film, Herzog brings us interviews with scientists, computer experts, technologists, robotics engineers, and game-designing microbiologists, and he also features the stories of ordinary people with extraordinary relationships to the internet like internet and video game addicts and others who live without the internet for other reasons."
" Herzog and a deeper understanding of the (Internet) world. Deeply moving!
",0.0,0.9867,2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Herzog provides a deep understanding of the past, present and future of the 'Internet'. The dark and the light. The fears and the hopes connected to it. He made Hackers talk, security bosses nod , social outcasts open up and Elon Musk speechless. Human adventures, beautifully depicted and with humorous, thoughtful voice overs.The documentary is divided into different chapters, each of them exploring the depths of Internet's development and consequences in our world... always clouded in a dreamlike, otherworldly atmosphere, that let's us look deeper into the matter. How was the internet created? Is Internet possible on Mars? How does Internet help science to grow? How does solar activity affects earth and the human race? How and why should machines learn? How do people live who experience physical pain by living in signal smog? Many different perspectives, filled with the human essence: souls, needs, hopes, dreams... because, we, the human kind, created the 'internet' and struggle now to live with 'it'. What does the human race want? Herzog explores that level beneath the facts. And that is why I love him as a film maker so dearly.It really helps that Herzog grew up without the Internet and has the view of an outsider onto this topic. Me, a digital native (29ys old), found that incredibly helpful, even tough I handle the matter already with a lot of critical and investive thoughts.Herzog has a true skill in combining (partly) staged images with real talk and real people and real situations. He knows how to say the right things and ask the right questions. He left Musk speechless at some point... while triggering the deepest level of his ambitious work - the reason WHY he does what he does. Herzog gets close to visionaries and dreamers. He gets close to the essence of the world.He gets close to us.Enjoy the ride and let yourself be guided by his compositions. It is worth it!"
" Too much disinformation & Irrational opinion stated as fact
",-0.34,0.886,2019-12-13 00:00:00,2,"I contrast ""Into The Inferno"" which came out in 2016 with this dreck.
It seems a poor attempt to explain the ""internet"" to your grandparent who remembers radio as a new fangled thing. By picking a conspiracist talking points to demonize new technology.
Granted technology has ripped from 1996 to now & first world countries are 'benefiting first. The tech is not absolute & totally world wide. Science & tech are used for well being & also for war. Beneficial applications of tech will help everyone. Look at drone delivered medicine in parts of Africa. Best practices for farming in provincial India presented by radio to help farmers production. Local bio gas facilities to provide cooking gas & by products for remote farming villages
Wealthy people calling a tech ""evil"" because of poor & morbid judgement of rescue personnel as a condemnation of the entire global network is incorrect.
If it bleeds .... Yeah, well I skip those stories.
Humans are everything under the sun. Treat others as you wish to be treated.
When 'we' stop exploiting the other someday, the world may live as 1.
Future Shock was released in 1972, Koyaanisqatsi 1982 & companion films
These are a better glimpses of change then this 'documentary' ."
" Worst interviewer ever
",-0.6249,-0.8911,2019-05-26 00:00:00,3,"The worst part about this strange disjointed documentary that offers no new insights is the interviewer.Take for example the Elon musk interview. He was actually saying something interesting when the interviewer interrupts him like a silly 5 year old to tell him something like ""will you take me along too?"". I mean seriously wth, the whole interview quickly went downhill after that very fast.This is not a good documentary."
" A series of fascinating, but scattered, interviews
",0.3071,0.7351,2019-02-25 00:00:00,8,"A collection of interviews with a wide range of people whose lives are/have been deeply connected to the rise of computer technology and the internet - entrepreneurs, academics, critics, hackers, even people who have to live in isolated areas because of their sensitivity to electromagnetic waves (or something like that.) It does not have much of a center and there is too much ground to cover effectively in a couple of hours, but it is all fascinating to watch and consider."
" No wake-up call when not already aware of Internet's dark sides. Topics loosely related to contemporary issues don't delve deep, albeit interesting in their own right
",0.128,0.9308,2018-09-10 00:00:00,7,"The mixed, even controversial user reviews that go along with this movie, reflect that some are disappointed because of having expected more deep delving treatments from this film maker, contrary to others who find the presented topics revealing and eye-opening and are happy with the given information. The professional reviews, on the other hand, are overall positive, with no exception, giving rise to the (possibly unfounded) assumption that this writer category is not familiar with the dark sides of Internet, and that the presented material is new to them and thus eye-opening.For me, having worked in IT all my life, mostly in the field of information security, those dark sides are all in my day's work, regrettably. This movie is not relevant for me to upgrade my knowledge, but rather to welcome a serious attempt to involve the ""end user"" in all the bad things that can happen. It is very difficult to make the layman (m/f) aware how important these issues are for them, let alone emphasizing how easy it is to fall victim of people up to no good. Awareness is rising, luckily, especially after some recent incidents in 2018 that arose everyone's attention, specialists and non-specialists alike.The sub-division in chapters is logical. It clarifies where a fresh subject starts, and never becomes artificial. I saw some subjects that have nothing to do with Internet, strictly speaking, like the problems some people have with radiation (conversely, WiFi and 3G/4G have considerably contributed to the growth of Internet, but it really is something else). Unlike many popular media, this movie did not show the dark sides of Internet along the path of sex, drugs, arms trade and similar dubious areas. Rather, a central theme was created out of the unmitigated distribution of embarrassing photos and intimate video's that could better be kept private, as well as hate mail that can have devastating effects on recipients. Along that line of thought, sending nasty e-mails is simplified and anonymized by Internet, and not not need any special hardware or software, so anyone can do it (conversely, the bare truth is that it would also have been possible without Internet).Nearly all issues brought forward were indeed thought provoking, including guessing what the world would look like after and without Internet, e.g. in a post-apocalypse situation. There were irrelevant exceptions, however, like a scene in the beginning of the movie, showing the room where the Internet was ""born"". The equipment on display gave rise to nostalgic feelings, for me that is, but does that part of history have some bearing on the Internet as it became after 30 years?? We know the optimistic stories of that time, where self-regulation and self-mitigation was assumed as a matter of course.As a final observation about the movie's format, several talking heads were introduced but their number was not overwhelming and they all got their speaking chance in several scenes, which allowed us to familiarize ourselves with them and their opinions. Unlike the usual voice-over that is annoying within the average documentary, this time the director himself (I assume) was not in the foreground too much, merely linking the scenes together without becoming too scholarly. He particularly did not try to showcase his knowledge (he himself admitted being ignorant on this subject, which could have served as a universal disclaimer, but I don't doubt his intentions here). Given my primary reasons to watch this movie, not to extend my knowledge but to welcome any serious attempt to showcase the issues at hand, I conclude that It will make many people aware what's going on, but is bound to disappoint others who expected more solid information."
" a retirement hobby project

" Provocative journey to reconstructing of the digital world

Herzog has reconstructed the virtual world, from its inception, to its fullest extent, exploring the digital background with the same curiosity and creativity that he has accessed to various regions of the Earth, such as Amazon, the Sahara, the South Pole and abandoned areas of Australia."
" Not Werner's best outing
",-0.5216,-0.9775,2018-02-06 00:00:00,5,"This documentary promises to shed light on the history of the internet, especially the time before the invention of the World Wide Web, in 1990. What we get instead is a procession of middle aged kooks pontificating randomly on AI takeover, sun spot events and the end of the world, and the internet being embedded into walls.The framing of most of the interviews is quite flippant. Normally a WH documentary is irreverent, but fond. Here though the viewer feels like an intruder into the world of a series of out-of-step eccentrics, whom the internet had long since left behind and taken on a life of its own - this being brought painfully into view when the question ""does the internet dream of itself""? is raised.It seems what was intended to be a film about the, mostly undocumented, innocent history of the pre www internet, took on a life of its own as the subjects started rambling about other things. It ended up showing only the wide-eyed naiievety of both Herzog and the interviewees, as they wandered away from their areas of expertise and into what is essentially uninformed futurology.There was a veteran ""Hacker"", who ""hacked"" into this and that, we're told. That he'd done 99% of his ""hacking"" by calling companies and pretending to be a manager wasn't made clear. A bizarrely posed family who'd had a picture of their daughter that had fatally crashed on a joyride in the father's Porsche published online, told us the devil was in the internet, listing some nasty things that had been emailed to them about their daughter and her death. In the same vein, an apocalyptic prediction by three fervent geeks, who think we're on the edge of a societal collapse caused by solar flares.All in all, the film misses the mark. If it had been presented a bit differently, I think it would have been a more worthwhile watch, but as it is, it comes across as nothing more than the poking of some Silicon Valley eccentrics with a stick, and seeing what they do."
" Herzog tackles the subject of the internet with both excited fascination and trepidation
",0.6808,0.9869,2018-01-09 00:00:00,7,"With Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World, director Werner Herzog continues his investigations into the nature of man and our influence on the planet. Having spent most of his earlier career exploring the nature of madness and the limits of the human mind with feature films often starring Klaus Kinski, Herzog's career of late has seen him focus primarily on documentaries, and there is perhaps no other filmmaker more naturally suited to the genre. Lo and Behold tells the story of the internet, from its humble birth in a seemingly forgotten office at UCLA, to its recent explosion and rapidly widespread use throughout the world, and Herzog tackles the subject with both excited fascination and trepidation.Herzog, as usual, plays the role of the viewer, actively participating in conversation with his interviewees. He often interrupts to confirm his understanding, or to offer his own unique philosophical musings. This may come across as distracting to anyone less than familiar with the filmmaker's output, but for us Herzog loyalists, his willingness to vocalise his own feelings or provide idiosyncratic observations throughout the documentary is precisely what makes his films such a joy. His subjects appear to instantly warm to him too, allowing them to relax and open up more, with the helmer only too happy to try and catch them off guard if they veer away from the subject. As one interviewee (who is in an internet rehab facility to cure his addiction to gaming and porn) gleefully bounds across a rickety wooden bridge to greet the camera, Herzog chuckles to himself and states that no further introduction is necessary.Although the documentary does occasionally ramble, Herzog doesn't allow his own personality to eclipse the subject at hand. He concerns himself with society's increasing detachment from one another as we spend more time in front of a computer screen, and ponders whether or not the internet can dream of itself (some of the reactions to this question are priceless). The film also explores the dark side of the net, telling the story of Nikki Catsouras, the young and beautiful girl who was killed in a horrific car accident, only for pictures of her mangled body to surface on the internet. Nikki's father soon started to receive e-mails with the pictures attached, complete with mocking messages that will make your blood boil. Lo and Behold depicts our brave new world as simultaneously exciting, beautiful and utterly terrifying, reaching as far as exploring our inevitable migration into space. It offers insight into everything from robot development, internet usage and dreams, allowing Herzog to further continue his almost alien fascination with both the beauty and horror of humanity."
" Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World: Mixed bag
",0.0,0.9153,2017-09-01 00:00:00,5,"Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World is a documentary by famed documentary film maker Werner Herzog. The guy has no niche, no area of expertise and has made films on everything from bears to volcanos to criminals and certainly has his way of doing things.This is a documentary on how the internet has shaped the modern world but it's flaw is it's lack of direction and instead bounces from one aspect of this digital world to the next rather randomly.It covers artificial intelligence and robots, it tells the origins of the internet, it touches upon the darkside of the net and gaming addictions and to those who insist on living without it.Though there are certainly some interesting parts the whole thing feels detrived and purposeless. I'd have rather seen a documentary that touches on one single aspect of a subject as broad as this.Watchable but not one of his best works and a tad chaotic for my liking.The Good: Well made Some very interesting moments The Bad: Herzog is a truly awful interviewer Documentary has no direction Things I learnt from this movie: If you own a Porche you make sure everyone knows, you don't acknowledge that you have a car.......it's a porche The internet is literally the anti-Christ"
" Herzog's latest documentary
",0.0,-0.8786,2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"LO AND BEHOLD, REVERIES OF THE CONNECTED WORLD is the latest documentary work from Werner Herzog, one of my favourite directors of all time. This isn't quite as good as his other documentaries although fans will be well pleased by the choice of material. Herzog's production is typically reverent; the director contributes his trademark softly-spoken narration and there are some good visuals and music throughout.The theme this time around is the Internet, although the narrative structure is broken down into smaller chapters, or vignettes, exploring various aspects of the Internet that interest the director. Therefore we meet a grieving family whose life has been ruined by tragedy and subsequent cyber-bullying, and a group of woodland recluses who claim that wireless technology makes them sick. Individually, all of the stories are interesting, although I prefer the director's work that concentrates on a single subject matter at greater depth, such as GRIZZLY MAN."
" a lot of loose ends that don't connect
",-0.3182,-0.742,2017-02-25 00:00:00,3,"Just like the internet, this documentary talks about everything but doesn't adhere to a coherent main story line. The ideas and dilemma's that are presented are often intriguing but all deserve a deeper view, instead of just being shown for about ten minutes, with sometimes no obvious connection shown between then. It feels like the director had a bunch of random observations and decided to throw them together. Later on, an idea of universal connectedness and eco-awareness gets thrown in and throws you further off from what you expected when you started to view: a history of the internet, grippingly told for the masses.Instead you get a lot of loose ends that don't connect, with the grand narrative as a forced way to tie together a set of random examples of the implications of internet in our world. It also doesn't help that the narrator has a weird pronunciation that quickly got on my nerves."
" dreams of the Internet
",0.4019,0.9951,2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"My relation with German director Werner Herzog and his films is dating back about four decades. Sometime in the 70s I attended a 'festival of West German film' which I do not know how escaped the censorship filters in my native Romania. That week I saw several of the films of filmmakers in the generation representing the 'New German Film ""which became one of the most interesting trends of the 70s in international cinema. Of all movies the strongest impression made to me 'Aguirre, the Wrath of Gods' - a historical drama set in the period of the 'Conquista' - the Spanish colonization of South America - starring Klaus Kinski, an extraordinary actor. The name the movie director was Werner Herzog was.The career of the film-maker which once was called by Francois Truffaut ""the most important film director alive"" has had many ups and downs. Part of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's generation, together with Margarethe von Trotta, Volker Schlöndorff and Wim Wenders his interests and artistic endeavors diversified after the 80s. Documentaries seems to be the area that gave the most rewards and enjoyed appreciation lately. His most recent film in this category 'Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World' is the history, present and future of the Internet. A subject that of course intrigued me allowing a unique encounter between my passion for cinema and one of the most interesting filmmakers of the movie industry, and my profession (and life passion) - the Internet.The ten episodes of the film treat in somewhat chronological order the beginnings of the Internet, its achievements and problems, and its future with opportunities and risks. The first short episode aroused interest and created nostalgia of those who lived the era of the beginnings of communications between computers, or - like me - had the opportunity to personally meet some of the heroes of those times. Leonard Kleinrock is one of those who attended the first attempt to establish communication between computers located in the Californian universities in Los Angeles and Stanford. The electrical cabinet (actually a computer with a tiny computing power compared to any mobile phone today, but a peak of technology in the late 60s) that initiated the communication in the episode described in the film was trying to send word 'log' (to login) to the remote machine. However, the first message ever sent over the Internet encountered first 'bug' on the Internet, and caused the first 'crash', so that the third letter of the word, a 'g' never appeared on the other side. It's just that 'lo' from the beginning of the movie title that offers the chance of a play of words in English using the expression 'lo and behold' which means surprise event that we might call in today's hi-tech language as 'disrupting '.Each of the other nine segments addresses from different perspectives the relationship between information technology and communications in the world we live today or or the world of the future. There are for example segments about artificial intelligence and its applications in intelligent transports, the Web's beginnings and development prospects of hypertext communications, about Internet safety and the unbearable easy security attacks, about the connection between electronic games and smart development programs. Several other topics were abandoned during production, for example those related to electronic payments and currency Bitcoin, although someday footage may appear and be made public. Known personalities including Bob Kahn, Elon Musk and Tim Berners-Lee appear in the film. Some episodes are more pessimistic and discuss the dangers and threats introduced by the Internet - impressive being the one about the family photos decrying the child died in an accident traffic incident are made public with a typical lack of discretion and sensitivity in communications unfortunately so prevalent on the Internet. Not all episodes are directly related to the Internet - for example the phenomenon of sensitivity to electromagnetic waves is known, studied and treated in different ways (the one shown in the movie is just one option) but it is not directly linked to the global network but rather to radio communications . We meet on this occasion with one of those folks belonging to an anarchist community that tries to live in social islands unconnected to the global network. The interviewing techniques used by Werner Herzog mostly include asking from off (we never see his face face) questions with German calm and precision (underlined by his accent), but he obviously guided interlocutors and created the glue and thread of reasoning developed in the film.Werner Herzog's interest in the Internet and technology is recent. Until a few years ago, Herzog could be considered a 'techno-skeptic' and its attitude toward certain Internet applications such as social media was clearly negative. Things have changed by the time he approached the project but the humanistic view of his questions are trenchant and come from unexpected directions, with a dose of caution and even pessimism about the interaction between human nature and technology These remain the traits that distinguish this film which is addressing in a different way than we are accustomed the Internet and mass communications.Addressing the theme of 'Dreams' and showing the combination of Internet and artificial intelligence as one of the directions the most promising technology, but also of the most intriguing and perhaps even dangerous of the possible routes in the future, Herzog places himself in the vanguard technology.Will the Internet become (together with entities equipped with artificial intelligence) completely autonomous? And after this happens - the problem only when - what will be the difference between the perfect thinking machines and the imperfect individuals that make up mankind? The ability to dream? Love? Can robots dream or fall in love? What about the Internet?"
" A flawless documentary about our times
",0.5106,0.991,2017-02-01 00:00:00,10,"WERNER HERZOG is a world class director who seems to keep his projects revolving around the constant thought of dreams. What could have been, what will happen, what are we thinking, and ultimately who are we? To make a documentary about the Internet, which would seem so rooted in science, and then use it to explore humanity and all our flaws and desires, made for a movie that is both eye-opening and reflective. For Herzog, I would expect nothing less, but the documentary still surprised me in more ways that one.It's a slow-churning story told in 10 chapters. The familiar voice of Werner himself narrates the action, through interviews and questions that attempt no less than to determine the progress of humanity with the dawn of the technological age; the age in which we are all connected and information is both limitless and ever-growing.In a small room in a science classroom in California, the very Internet was born in the 1960's, and the first transmitted message ""LOG"" was cut off midway through. As one man explains, the importance and simplicity of that first message (""lo and behold what man has achieved"") is the thesis on which Herzog explores the topics. We see how information grew, how newspapers were first programmed for people to view on their home computers, how emails began to document business needs at almost instantaneous speeds. What a marvel, indeed.Smartly, Herzog also explores the darker shades of our brilliance: of hate mail and the lawlessness of the online community. From hackers to a family who received spam emails of their daughter's mangled body, nearly decapitated in a car wreck... The tapestries of any invention are countless, but as the documentary begins to explore, no man made invention in history has ever grown at such an exponential rate. A wide-eyed woman with a Stepford Wife's sensibility declares ""the Internet is Satan.""In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, Lo And Behold would be a bore of talking heads and the breakdown of important dates and times. Herzog seems to relish the bore, asking his subjects questions that often throw them off (""do you love this robot?""). It's oftentimes quite funny, but when we explore the darker implications just below the surface, it could also be one of the scariest films I have ever viewed. With our reliance on the internet so thoroughly engrossed in our lives, one scientist speculates that potentially billions could die were a large solar flare to wipe out electricity as we know it. Nature give and nature take away, but has humanity moved beyond the point of simple survival without technological help?With a haunting score that recalls precious Herzog themes, the movie is nonetheless a fascinating and endlessly entertaining journey through modern times, with Herzog's deliciously German accent piercing through the bland images of computers and wires. There seems no better director to tackle this subject matter, and in fact I doubt many other filmmakers could achieve something so remarkable from something so apparently average as the Internet.I left this movie, looked around, thought about life. There's an existential theme at work which forced me to think about how my life is wholly dependent on machines. They make life easier. I need them for daily support and connectivity. At this point in society, 2016, what is life if not the reliance on technology?"
" Dry, with few tasty bits
",0.0,0.979,2017-01-29 00:00:00,4,"Whilst this documentary tackles a very meaty subject (technology and its effects on humans, the world and the universe), it unfortunately is very dry in its delivery and quite limited in its effectiveness.I think this is for 2 main reasons - firstly, Herzog mainly interviews people who are very tech-savvy, tech-driven people who are completely and totally immersed in their chosen field. As such, they talk very enthusiastically in very technical terms about very dry topics. Imagine asking a Maths Fan Club to tell you all about what their favourite prime number is and why and then filming it....DRY, BORING & INDECIPHERABLE for those of us not on the same page, right?! I feel like a lot of the film was like that! I learned a couple of interesting facts from these people, but not enough to sustain a whole film's worth of interest. The more 'human' element, where Herzog talks to people about the effect technology has had upon them, is far more interesting - but there is much less of that in the film than the technical stuff. I think he was trying to link the 2 together - i.e. here is what the intent was/is, but this is actually what has happened/will happen - but he doesn't pull it off.This brings me to my second point - Herzog has picked a really expansive subject, and as such, cannot possibly give each element the attention it needs or deserves. He should have just stuck with, say, the effects of the internet, or the looming figure of artificial intelligence. There is not enough time and space in one film to link all aspects together efficiently.So, if you are a very logical, tech-savvy person, who enjoys technically informing documentaries, you may really like this. If like me, you're more into the psychological/emotional angles, you likely won't."
" When it's bad it's still pretty good.
",0.3818,0.9908,2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"When it's bad it's still pretty good...Lo and Behold is in my opinion not one of the best efforts by Herzog. It's entertaining, it has Herzog's trademark narration which is great but somehow this film and the way Herzog approached the subject matter feel a little bit hollow. Like Herzog phoned it in.There are really funny moments like those in the trailer but more often there are moments that feel a bit cheap. For example there is a family interviewed who where victim of being harassed on the internet. People where sending them gruesome pictures of their daughter who died in a car accident. This family is still pretty much damaged by these events. Instead of delving deeper in to why people do such awful things Herzog uses the family for laughs. Maybe this was not his intention but because their story was so minimal we got to see caricatures of who these people are really like. Which feels a bit lazy. The same goes for some of the other people interviewed. Herzog does his best to get an poetic or thoughtful response but most of the time people just look at him like they don't understand the question. Of course for each of the moments there is a brilliant scene just around the corner. So it's certainly not all bad. But a lot of times certain segments don't really add up or make sense. Like for example the segment about internet on Mars. It seemed a little bit disjointed and not the most coherent story. At these moments luckily Herzog comes in with his fantastic voice and entertaining narration and saves the movie from unraveling.All in all I found this movie entertaining but not up to the standards of other Herzog movies."
" Too much for one documentary!
",0.0,0.9719,2017-01-11 00:00:00,5,"The overarching theme of this documentary by Werner Herzog is the internet. However, this is a HUGE topic--way too much for one film. Additionally, Herzog chooses to go off in many directions--any of which could have merited an entire documentary in and of itself. So, had ""Lo and Behold"" been a series, it would have been terrific. As is, it's enjoyable but often frustrating because it lacks a concise focus.The film begins with a tiny introduction to the birth of the internet through the ARPANET. I really liked this historical aspect of the film...but it was very brief...frustratingly so. The film then bounced to topics like self-driving cars, cyber bullying, living off the net and folks who claim to have illnesses caused by various waves (such as cell phones, microwaves and the like), hacking, the vulnerability of the net to solar activity, artificial intelligence and robots and the future of the internet and technology! As I said, too much information and it's presented but often not adequately explored. So is the film worth seeing? Yes. But it's also maddening to watch as it often felt as if you've been invited to a gourmet meal....with 156 different courses and each one comes and goes like lightning in order to get the meal completed on time!I have seen many of Herzog's documentaries and have loved many of them. I know he's a brilliant and talented man...but here the whole project just seems as if it was slapped up on the screen without regard to the subject matter or the effect it would have on the viewer. A misfire."
" Thought-provoking but ultimately limited
",-0.3291,0.8929,2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"The was a small disappointment for me. Wheeling in a long succession of intellectuals and posing philosophically abstract questions at them about the implications of the Internet seems like something that could yield interesting results. In this case it leads almost nowhere. Boffins and great minds are sometimes a slave to their own sense of purpose and grandeur, always looking to imagine the most incredible eventualities and possibilities regardless of how impossible or possible they are. The people in this documentary are no doubt amazing intellects who have the native IQ to leave myself and the majority of humans dead in the water. However, it takes an intellectual to sell the idea that the Internet could gain autonomy and want to control us as a species. This is anthropomorphic projection on the grandest Earthly scale.Werner also employs a deeply foreboding soundtrack of elongated drones and celestial dread to add weight to the scientific poetry and future doomsday predictions of his interviewees. At times you could almost be drawn into this darkening of mood, but then you hear another piece of vague mumbo-jumbo and interlocutory nonsense and chuckle, remembering: it's a documentary by Werner Herzog, which sadly means you are just experiencing his default style. As well, the question ""can the Internet dream of itself?"" is so deeply boring and unbound by any objective framework it merely acts as a conceit from which to further ramble on the topic of non- biological sentience (something this film does rather well) and ends up in another cul-de-sac, (like all conceits do). The area of AI is seemingly in a very strange cultural place right now whereby hitherto rational people are being drawn into imagining a secular religion based around a technological cosmology. Technology is either the devil, God, or both. Either way, the great power it possesses comes from the mundane necessities of our collective lives. Mythologising is fun but really we just want the same things we've always wanted (see Maslow 'hierarchy of needs'). The internet will not change that. This strange, almost creepy substitution for God in Godless world, or power bigger than ourselves, is silly to watch coming out of intelligent people's mouths. Humans will not sleepwalk into the matrix. We will not eat the apple in the garden of Eden and reach a tipping point between our desire for technological innovation and the rise of AI overlords. This won't happen because humans won't desire it. Even if it was plausible, the road to such an event is not clearly laid out here. Lastly, moral questions about the effects of technology are useful. This poses some but doesn't go deep enough into them in order to create a basis or first principle to work from. Too much technology is one thing but please explain why. What should we keep and why? What should we discard and why?Anyway, partially thought-provoking but ultimately limited to thought experiments and conjecture about a future we can only vaguely imagine and will likely not happen.﻿"
" Worthwhile, fascinating, diverse, and decent!
",0.7345,0.9963,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Watched this on Netflix, as I was fed up with all those documentaries we have on ""free"" TV. I was not aware that Werner Herzog does such profound documentaries, now I know better. This documentary tackles a lot of interesting, and often hurtful subjects. For once it made me proud of working in the industry and being able to contribute something worthwhile. So much good energy gets wasted, and there is a lot of rubbish on the Internet, but there are also the pearls of human wisdom, and so I encourage everyone to go looking for them, or even better, make their own contributions. This goes to show that you can really make a difference by using the Internet for wonderful applications, like bringing people together, and make them understand our world (and one another) much better. It made me very curious about current developments in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics and I sure hope there will be much more progress in the next years.I don't think that it is really justified to criticize this documentary, as you really cannot do this gigantic subject any justice in such a short amount of time. There could be ten individual movies on just the ten topics in the documentary! Kudos to Mr. Herzog for tackling such a task and staying decent all the way through. I really felt for all the people who suffered the ill effects. Stay strong and feel your own energy, and speak up your own truth. Through the internet, you will be heard."
" A Different Look at the Future
",0.0,-0.9504,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Werner Herzog's exploration of the Internet and the connected world.My expectation was that this film would explore the development of the Internet and a bit about how it works and has expanded. To an extent, this is accurate. We get a look at the birthplace of the Internet, and we see plenty of stories about the world of computing, especially hacking (both from cyber threats and from trophy-hunters like Kevin Mitnick).But we go way beyond that. I am disappointed that we don't explore the Internet more, but Herzog makes up for this by exploring other loosely connected ideas. Space travel to Mars, for one. He also talks with people who have an intense sensitivity to electro-magnetic fields. The most bizarre segment involves a family who was apparently attacked over the death of their daughter. Herzog makes the family look a bit crazy, and this isn't helped by the mother's claim that the Internet is the Anti-Christ, a view that clearly demonstrates she is mentally unstable."
" Unworthy
",-0.4588,0.8566,2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"Yes, summed up, I would say 'unworthy'. From both the perspective of the Internet: way too complex, large and important to be portrayed the way it is in this 'documentary'.And from the perspective of the maker. Werner Herzog can make very nice films, were his style and humor is a real benefit. This is just not one of them. It seems to be due to a total lack of knowledge and feeling with the subject.Watching this movie feels like someone picked a very at random words and then tried to make a movie on The Internet around it. Monks.. Mars.. Robots.. Dreams.. Radiation.. Stars.. and this just continues.If the purpose of this movie was to let Mr Herzog have a laugh, I'm sure he succeeded. But pretending it to show the history of The Internet, and it's social impact.. No way!Shame on you Werner!"
" An essay, not a documentary
",0.0,0.8891,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Herzog is a character, a clown, and it's hard not to love him. The moments where he peeks out (voice only) in this film are the absolute highlights. But it's important to remember with Herzog's films that they are often more than just documentaries, and I don't believe for a second that Herzog feels any obligation to present anything factual. He's interested in concept and perspectives, but not necessarily a photo realistic portrayal of the world. This is why I would argue that Herzog's films are more essays than documentaries. As long as you remember this, you will have a good time watching this movie.Herzog approaches the internet as if he is a stranger to it, leading to some very naive questions to the highly educated people he is interviewing. They are made to answer different questions than they are used to, and this leads to different answers. You can see Elon Musk being pulled out of his element by Herzog volunteering to go to mars.Herzog has a gift of finding the peculiar in people and situations. I am a bit worried that some of the people he is interviewing is not aware of how he will present them. I'm sure Herzog does it with love, but it's still obvious that he pick moments in the interviews where they are at their most goofy.When it comes to the subject itself, and it's interesting (though disjointed) exploration of the future of the internet and the connected world, but like any essay, it doesn't really answer any questions."
