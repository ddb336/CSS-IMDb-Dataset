",-0.5719,-0.7003,2021-03-31 00:00:00,3,"This is why Hollywood big shots think they're all that and are so full of themselves. It is all spelled out here in this movie. Smug overacting, and a script so full of typical tropes, predictable plot points, convenient throwaway climax and insipid dialogue. And of course the cheating DA."
" Brilliant thriller with difficult to watch ending

I agree with those who say the 2002 and 2015 shots should have been indicated by age/makeup/hairstyle differences. I had difficulty with Julia Robert's character admitting guilt and knowing if an investigation took place she would be found guilty of a different crime.
The ending kept me awake all night."

The story is a classic crime one on the 1st sight, but evolves and twists towards the end.

" Decent (this version), wonderful (Argentinian version).
",0.5719,0.9386,2021-01-14 00:00:00,7,"El secreto des su ojos, an Argentinian movie that won 1 Oscar in 2010 is much better than this one.
The only issue watching the Argentinian movie is that if you don't know Spanish, you have to read the subtitles and it's not easy at all. The ending is a bit different and I prefer the South American choice, I never read the book, so I don't know how the book ends.
I'm not going to say anything more than this, because it's important that you people watch both of them and then you'll be able to decide which one you liked more.
IMHO this movie is decent (7/10) in the American version, but wonderful (10/10) in the South American one.
Enjoy!"

The one from 2009 won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film.

Roberts' character definitely states that Beckwith is NOT Marzin, the suspected killer of her daughter (for obvious reasons which would be a major spoiler if revealed here) and yet the same actor Joe Cole plays both these characters!?
The entire film was puzzling because of the many flashbacks where there was no discernible change in the characters' appearances or age!

by the confusion caused by inane flashbacks."

A whale which the viewer somehow believes will eventually spring back to life. But, does not. The film never finds a tempo, a pace, a way to involve the viewer.'The Secret In Their Eyes' stars Nicole KIdman and Julia Roberts. Two favorites (of mine). Add to them Chiwetel Ejiofor as the leading man and you've got talent enough for three pictures. But in the roles of three law officers in Los Angeles, they cannot save this one.The story is one we've seen before. A crime has gone unsolved for many years. But now the detectives and attorneys involved in never having solved the crime are re-united to give it one last 'go'. Add to this the fact that one of the three characters - played by Julia Roberts - was victimized by the long-ago crime. Even so, nothing lifts this film.Is there a surprise ending? Will the crime eventually be solved? Yes. And yes.But I swear to you, knowing it just ain't worth the pain."

Also after that time, given that he's still looking, you might consider letting him in on it. Ray keeps allowing them to escape by letting them know he's coming and at times it's purposely misleading. Kidman's unconvincing and key elements are missing, for something of this nature."

However this one here is a very, very good movie and deserves a much better rating than the current 6.3Do I even have to mention how good the acting is? This is not your movie, if you are looking for a lot of action. There is some, but not very much. It mostly draws from a more than dense atmosphere and well written characters and character arcs. If this is your thing, I highly recommend giving this a try."

There is a blueprint for an amazing version of this film, it's the Spanish original. These people had no idea what was good about the original and sucked all the suspense and mystery out of it. Characters are missing and rewritten for no discernible reason other than to give Julia Roberts more screen time. WTF. Watch the original instead. Chiwitel, Kidman and Bruce Norris do well, blame the director and the rewritten parts for this disaster."

The case was never closed, but it does sit with them throughout the years until a photo of the office picknic turns up showing all of them together and an unknown man standing next to the daughter. The cast does top notch acting as you become aware of everything that was/is at stake. This probably deserves 10 stars but I gave it 8 because it does get slow sometimes waiting for the next thing to unravel."
" Boring and incoherent film with occasionally good performances
",0.079,-0.9913,2020-09-23 00:00:00,4,"I have not seen the Argentine original. This adaption does not know what it is, and feels like a disjointed collage of other films. The centre that is holding the film together are the relationships between the star actors, but that is difficult to see as you watch, because it always seems to be about something else.The first act also jumps between different times, and it seems to be about a mysterious murder case. Once you think that, it's actually about higher ups protecting the suspect, because he's an important snitch. Except that it then proceeds like a normal procedural crime TV show, and the suspect just runs away a few times. There is no actual mystery as you watch. And no thrill. The murderer is just some guy. He's not even particularly menacing or arrogant, as it would be fitting to play up the apparent premise. The reasons why higher ups don't want to apprehend him at that time are not particularly villainous or mysterious, either.As you are on the brink of falling asleep, it can dawn on you that this film is about justice not being served, expecially for trite reasons, and what it does to people, and their relationships. But it's not really a drama, either.In the end, it's just a terribly boring film. I put it on 4/10, because it's mixed bag of nothing in particular. It is in some way worse than a cliché revenge thriller, or schlocky B action film. Such films may not be actually better in terms of writing, acting or cinematography, but they are more entertaining. This is just everyone's waste of time."

Stupid Americans think all muslims speak the same language?During the film, I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened. Except for last 5 minutes. I gave 4 points only because of Julia Robert's acting. Nicole Kidman's role is same with any other role of her. And the black dude was just weird.Go watch something else. It was a huge disappointment."
" Not worth it
",-0.1695,0.814,2020-09-11 00:00:00,3,This film is honestly not at all worth the hype. It seems to be a lot more focused on office politics and subtle romances than on creating a suspenseful or even interesting murder mystery. The last 10 minutes of the movie are more interesting than the film in its entirety.

A script which has already won an Oscar and an opportunity but doesn't excites.Acting is the main problem in the movie as it seems that apart from Ejiofor no one had been paid well hence done a half hearted attempt. As per me Kidman was the biggest disappointment. Screenplay is slow and doesn't holds for long. Climax and ending is predictable.Overall an avoidable thriller movie which doesn't excites and impresses much despite of having a strong star cast."

screenplay; personally I found the movie under stimulating for the most part of the movie. Of course, the movie setting and the mood describes that but it felt more like a drama than a thriller. Of course, some loopholes in the script, but overall acceptable based on the narrative.Final verdict: recommended"

I find the adaptation of the remake a bit problematic.There has been an attempt to alter the script in comparison to the Argentinian film, and that led to change the depth of the meaning of the story on the whole, as to even out the rough dramatic character and the motivation of dead-end option is something that was not so strong on the basis of ethics and taking revenge.In the end the ""secret in their eyes"" is something not utterly unique, which weakens a lot the link between the title and the plot."

This was one of those rare films. And no less enjoyable. Really a good, entertaining film, with interesting characters and dynamics, and a who done it that rivets your attention. With interesting twists. Two curious things that I noticed. How very pretty Nicole Kidman looked in this one, and how not so pretty Julia Robert's character was. Both obviously done deliberately, but a bit startling to see Julia looking so dowdy. Two of my favorite actresses, and both beautiful women.

" Solid but not a patch on the original
",0.5023,0.9555,2020-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Let me start by being clear, the original Argentinian version of this film is one of my all time favourite films. A multi layered thriller that draws you in to the characters and takes you on a journey through how a horrific loss can affect the life of those who remain to pick up the pieces of their life.Therefore I approached this version with understandable apprehension. I'd read the less than impressive reviews of Hollywood's remake so it took me a long time to get round to finally watching it.If you've seen the original then it's almost impossible to watch this without comparing it to the original. The story has been shifted around a little and characters enlarged and diminished to reflect the bigger names on the film poster. The main protagonist also has none of the real menace of the original, But if you can look beyond that or haven't seen the original then it's a solid albeit slow moving thriller which asks some interesting questions about what justice really means and who really benefits from the judicial system."

I realised after watching this there was so many layers that I missed. Some scenes I thought were better in the original version but overall I prefer the American version so much more. This is a geat movie. Tense plot, interesting characters and some really great twists that keep you guessing right up until the end.

" Menh...

My notion is that the idea, the concept of the story is probably uniquely 'other' in flavour, in comparison to North American tastes.
OTOH, I have read a lot of good, articulate reviews of this version here, and so I wonder if this film could have been made better, if it had been made in a tighter, more North American fashion.
For me, the problem is that I just don't care enough about any of the main characters. The DA Morales is interesting, 'Bumpy' is interesting, in fact all of the characters apart from the main three characters are interesting. It just makes me so sad that the actors of the main roles were stuck in a different movie than the secondary characters ;>
Another way I looked at it is that it seems to me that the action in the movie isn't centred around the main characters, it's around the secondary characters. The three main characters are stuck in a slow-as-molasses dreamworld that just isn't all that interesting. I get that it's a psychological thriller, not an action/mystery/thriller film. I just wish that it could have been more compelling and more interesting. By the end of the movie, I felt kinda cheated, just didn't care about the twist, kinda shrugging my shoulders just as the main characters do, in the end. Who cares?"

I watch so many great movies, even BBC series directed and acted better. There is no real chemistry between the two who loved each other. The acting of Juliet Roberts just had good make-up but she acted poorly.. No real suspense throughout even though directing tried to, but the selection of music did not match the scene.

The main plot is an FBI agent has been obsessively trying to track down the killer and rapist of another agent's daughter for over 13 years because he thinks he could have indirectly prevented it. This is a bland detective story that intermixes flashbacks from 13 years ago and present time which slowly begin to shed light on the full story. The big detectors for me were the occasional and preposterous character decisions, unconvincing romance and lazy and clumsy storytelling. For example, detective work that was done in a serious nature, with emotions running high, were the level at which one has learned from the most elementary of police TV shows will spoil evidence or a conviction. The script should have equaled the star fire power they paid for."
" A CSI episode turned into a movie
",0.0,0.9576,2019-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Reading the title, you can probably guess one of the main problems with this movie: The pacing. It is just too slow. On top of that, there are almost no action scenes that could have solved that. Which would be excusable with some compelling dialoge, but instead we get a 5 minute long scene were people are meeting up again in the dullest way possible, or they are explaining a comic book like a Wikipedia page would if it could speak. Now the story is quite good, except the directing and pace are really nullifying that. Cinematicly it is nice, but nothing special. The ending was as dull and predictable as you would expect, and it just lacks overall passion. Prepare for a good story told in a boring way, with good actors having their talents being wasted troughout most of the movie(Typical M. night shamylan effect). It might be worth a watch for the story, but you would be better off watching a CSI episode."

" Ridiculous plot holes
",-0.3612,-0.9923,2018-11-16 00:00:00,2,"Most of the reviews here are focused on the structure and pacing and performances. My main complaint is with the plot holes as wide as a river. Is it just me or did anyone else think they didn't have enough evidence on EITHER guy to suspect him much less hoping to arrest him? I was never convinced to begin with that the kid was the murderer. Just because the detective was so sure based on nothing, we were to be also? It seemed the only thing the detective was relying on was that the kid was looking at the murder victim in a photo. And later it is revealed that the suspect was an informant in a terrorist cell for the police so they didn't want to show any connection between the cops and him, yet he not only shows up at a police department picnic, but joins in a photo that anyone could have posted online! Pretty shoddy undercover police work there! Then worse yet, the ""second"" suspect, during which a cop was killed while trying to apprehend, is based on the detective being convinced he was the murderer because he looked like him if he had had plastic surgery (really??) and he liked horses. The ending didn't ring true either. I was convinced when the detective left the gun for Julia Roberts that she was going back in to kill herself. That would have been a better ending. (Oh wait, no, of course not, it's Hollywood after all.) And in typical sexist Hollywood fashion, what was the point of Nicole Kidman's blouse becoming unbuttoned when her arm was grabbed. (Another eye roll out of a dozen from me.) Do any of these actresses ever have the gumption to stand up to these directors over these gratuitous shots? Nothing to do with the story at all. Maybe due to the MeToo movement there will be an end to this crap."

Vigilante cop (which happens to be the parent of the victim) catches and imprisons him for 13 years without anyone's knowledge.The tag line is: when you imprison him, you imprison yourself. That's it really, some tangent storyline but nothing much other than that. Not very interesting."

",-0.5413,0.901,2018-08-30 00:00:00,5,"When I saw the cast list, which includes Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman and the brilliant Chiwetel Ejiofor I thought I was in for ninety minutes of sheer quality, you can forgive me for thinking that, when you take into account the number of awards shared by the stars, the budget, and the pedigree of the original movie. Unfortunately, Hollywood strikes again, the curse of the poor remake, it was virtually impossible to mess this up, but mess up they did. The acting was fine, strong production values, a clever story, in theory. However, the execution is so bad, the film lacks any degree of suspense, it lacks any degree of subtlety needed to tell such a story, and the characters are such that I didn't care less what happened to any of them, as I have no connection with anybody. The film should have been gripping, exciting, at least moved you to empathise with the characters, but no, it was utterly bland, such a waste of so much talent. I'm stunned by some of the positive reviews I've read, what are they seeing that I couldn't, all I did was yawn, and I'm easy to please in terms of thrillers.Duller then dishwater. 5/10"
" Impressive
",0.5106,0.9509,2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,"There's not many movies that make me cry within 10 mins into them...but this one did!
The acting throughout was spot on. 
Yes it does flick between the years often, but it is easy to tell between them...for instance, Julia Roberts looks about a million years old (which is actually pointed out in the flick too) in the later one and Nicole Kidman's hair is different, as is Dean Norris's. So it's easy to keep up with the story.
And the twist at the end, I was not expecting till he actually goes back to her house at the end, and that was only cause he was recapping things she'd said. I literally thought that when she said she'd killed the guy, she had done. So that was a good surprise and well done.
The ending was particularly fab, it's exactly what I'd have wanted to do to him if anyone hurt my Daughter as well, especially considering how much of a snide creep he was!
The movie does a very good job of making us think that we're looking for the bad guy all the way through. 
The scene at the beginning, this one was well acted, you really felt for her and put yourself in her shoes, she didn't care about evidence tampering, she just climbed in and hugged her Daughter and no one questioned that, even her colleague was an emotional wreck when he first realized. 
It's definitely a bit of a slow movie, but it's also very worth the patience. 
I nearly didn't watch it, through thinking the synopsis sounded a little boring, but I'm glad I did as it was anything but!"

Imdb score aside I still gave it a go.I found it to be excellent. The story is far from the usual bland Hollywood productions and the acting from Chiwetel, Nicole and Julia are just excellent. Julias raw emotional scene early on makes this worth a watch just by itself. 
Can't see why it has a measly 6,3 score on here.Its definitely not an action cop movie but more of an emotional crime drama focusing on the relationships between people and how to find conclusion after experiencing some dramatic events 13 years back. (haven't seen the original so I won't do any comparisons):)
-excellent acting.
-not a too obvious storyline.:(

No character development and a lack of chemistry between the two leads leaves it feeling two dimensional. The subtlety that the films title suggests is no where to be found. Add to that, a narrative that repeatedly chops and changes between the present (2015) and 2002 leaves you constantly checking for grey hair on Chiwetel Ejiofor's head. It leaves a clumsy mess of a movie. The one saving grace perhaps is the performance from Julia Roberts. Worth a watch, but if you want a masterpiece then watch the original version."

There are federal crimes and there are state crimes. Murder is 100% only a state crime, unless it's some part of a RICO conspiracy. Why would the FBI be doing surveillance on a mosque in order to stop a potential terrorist attack out of a state district attorney's office? Is the FBI L.A. field office so packed that they're renting out space? Why would they even remotely be working together? It doesn't happen. FBI works with the U.S. Attorney's Office, and even then they don't work INSIDE the office. Until the case is ready to be prosecuted, they just work out of their own office. From trying to find the perp at a Dodger's game (and incredibly successfully being able to do so in a sea of 56,000 people), to allowing the FBI agent/Proscecutor played by Julia Roberts to completely contaminate the crime scene, to beating up the perp after he finally gives you a confession.

No chemistry between actors, feels like a typical American run-of-the mill police movie whereas the original is much much more (Argentinian 70's era, love-story, human condition, ...). Kidman acts like a stiff wax doll (actually looks like one), and even Roberts completely over-acts. Besides the only saving grace Chiwetel Ejiofor, totally unconvincing. Go watch the original, incredible chemistry between Soledad Villamil and Ricardo Darín, great performances by Guillermo Francella and Pablo Rago, atmosphere, music.

I feel like this is one of those movies that could have been a lot better had it not been directed by someone who did not understand its vision or story. The timeline is confusing to stick to (unless you can reference Nicole Kidman's long or short hair for time reference).

However, it wasn't widely distributed outside of a handful of big cities in the US, so it went unseen by and unknown to most American moviegoers. Ignore the condescension about this film from the big city art house film goers who wrote reviews dismissing it. Its plot will seem new and refreshing to many who never got the opportunity to see the Argentinian film. This remake brings the story to US audiences with some changes to make it more relatable.I'm not one who wants to give away spoilers, but I will say you've never seen Julia Roberts in a role quite like this one. It will make you wish she had taken more chances in the roles she chose during the peak of her career. Here she's the mother of a young girl who was brutally murdered, and the film is about the 13-year quest to find and charge the killer. I'll just leave it at that."

Our suspect was a key mosque informant for the FBI who were not willing to give up the informant for a simple rape and murder charge. Kidman undergoes make-up changes while Julie Roberts looks devoid of make-up and tired for most of the film. The acting was well done, the plot had a twist, but the drama wasn't as engaging as I would have expected from such a cast.

I watch foreign films, I lived in Spain. I don't expect a film made in the USA to be the same as one made elsewhere. That is not what I am looking for in a review.The movie switches back and forth between what is the current time and a time in the past over a decade ago that tore apart the lives of all those related to a crime that happened then. Initially it was difficult to know what time frame you were in and then it turned out that you didn't care. It did not take away from the story being told. There are surprises along the way as the mystery unfolds and the ending is also a big surprise but it turns out that this doesn't matter either. What you care about are the people and their story. Oddly enough, at the end you are left with hope.I did not expect to like this movie. I did not expect to see Julia Roberts successfully play the part she played. Everyone in this was top rate. It is not often that a Hollywood movie surprises me and moves me. I put this in the category of ""Unusual Suspects"". Not many make that category with me."

I am rating this as a separate film and not comparing it to the original. The acting is top notch and believable. Ejiofor, Kidman and Roberts all do a great job. It's an interesting crime thriller with some twists and turns. It's about a team of rising investigators, along with their supervisor, whose worlds are suddenly torn apart during a homicide investigation that hits close to home. It was completely watchable and entertaining. I'm not saying this is a high brow, blow your socks of type of movie, but it certainly deserves a far higher rating.

The guy had no real connection to her. The only reason a perp would put clothes back on a female after murdering her - cover up her body - is if they had some kind of connection to her (family, friend, partner). For example, Amber Hagerman, a nine year old taken off her bike in broad daylight was found with one sock on face down in a creek behind her apartment building. Similarly, Kristen French, a 15 year old after being held captive for days was found nude on the side of the road. Her head was even shaved to eliminate any potential evidence of carpet fibres. These victims are discarded like trash. A perp is not going to put clothes back on them, especially since clothes always has some kind of evidence on it (head hair,dog hair, feline hair, clothing/carpet fibre, pubic hair, the kind of forensic material that cannot be bleached away). Many people have been convicted of similar crimes on weak evidence, such as carpet fibres in a car matching fibres found within the inside of a girl's pants, for example, even after being submerged in a lake for some time. This is NOT always the case. Some girls are found partially clothed, but that is only because the unsub was in a hurry and didn't bother to remove all the clothing during the assault. In the case of this movie, the unsub bleached the girl on the inside and out. If he went to all that trouble, he would not risk putting clothes back on the girl, since clothing always carries some carpet, hair, clothing fibres on it. Also, he did a bad a bleaching job, since the clothing was not even bleached. The forensics in the case were pathetic, it looked the case was taking place in some poor country like Columbia, Mexico or the Philippines with no forensic team of specialists. She went into the dumpster and completely contaminated the scene and all the evidence at the scene. Any evidence on the daughter was contaminated at that point with fibres she brought on herself. (That is why investigators wear special clothing prior to going into these types of scenes.)They are detectives in a joint force on terrorism and yet they are asked to investigate a rape and murder of a female. This is also unlikely. There are HOMICIDE INVESTIGATORS for that, not the same thing as homeland security. Whoever wrote this movie really needs to watch some crime dramas and forensic files episodes because even in the 1980s, when DNA had NOT been used in court yet and was at its most early stages of development, there was still a lot of forensic data collected at a scene. The acting was good, but the movie was boring, jumped back and fourth, and was inaccurate/unrealistic."
" Confusing usage of flashbacks.
",-0.2263,0.2006,2017-03-26 00:00:00,4,"In this movie, there were way too many flashback scenes and it was often way too confusing to tell if it was a flashback scene or not. Each time it cut to a new scene, you had to figure out each time if it was from 2002 or 2015. Further complicating the matter was how the actors and actresses had the exact same hair-styles and looked the same ages in the 2002 and the 2015 scenes. If they would've shot the 2002-era scenes first and then had a make-up and hair crew change the hairstyles and make-up enough to make it easier to tell which decade the scenes were from, that would've helped a lot. Better yet, just doing the film in chronological order would've made the move far better and a lot more enjoyable to watch. Using flashbacks when everyone involved was too lazy and unprofessional to make it work knocked the movie down from a solid 7 to a weak 4."

Not just any remake but a remake with 2 of my favorite actors (Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts) and an incredible supporting cast. Herein comes the obvious, if the story is perfect, because everyone who's seen the original will vouch, and the actors are top notch, what might be the problem ? ... the director. He poorly built the suspense of the story and switched a few things around in an attempt to be original that simply did not fly. He took a story that could have been saved in the ending, the big moment, instead, he treated it superficially and rushed. The original reveal made the original film a devastating experience to watch, leaving the viewed haunted of what had transcribed, here however, the director basically gave the ending away beforehand and simply lacked the skills of creating a moment of dread,devoid of emotion, by so diminishing the original work. Overall I had a very hard time staying engaged in watching a complete mess of a remake.Hollywood, please never hire this person to direct any more remakes of classics in the near future ..Thank you!

" Holds Up Well For a Remake.
",0.2732,-0.6751,2017-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I've never seen the original and, as most reviewers seem to feel, this remake of an Argentine movie isn't as good. Few remakes are. Compared to the sometimes light-hearted feel of ""El Secreto de Sus Ojos"" this one is dark and dense. But it's not ""bad."" Not as bad as hearing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony played on a kazoo, for instance.The governing word in the script is ""passion."" Everybody seems to use it at one time or the other. And in fact that's the theme, the passion that drives some to kill and the passion that causes agents of the law to break the law in order to exact what they consider a proper revenge on the killer, and the law be damned.That makes it sound rather like too many movies of the past decade or two, with the holotype maybe being Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish."" After some brief initial offense, the Avenger (or ""the Punisher,"" if you like) engages in some kind of deliberate slaughter that has the audience cheering for him.Fritz Lang kept the narrative constrained within the strictures of the law (but not politics) in ""The Big Heat"" but we're light years beyond such delicate issues now. Somebody rapes your wife or kills your daughter? Make him suffer abominably for twenty years before finally offing him and burying him in the rose garden.All the performances are up to par. The part of Dumpy, who provided much of the humor in the original, is reduced. He's still involved in some amusing scenes but nevertheless some lumens are lost. Nicole Kidman is no longer a kid but she's beautiful, sexy, and competent -- and adds a bit more intricacy to the plot regarding marriage and intimacy. She's in a position to get it on with the central figure but is rebuffed.The central figure is a black detective in the anti-terrorist unit and that may be one of the reasons no fluids are exchanged. I mean, what the hell is this -- Mandingo? At the same time he's a fine and subdued actor and even when he loses it he seems in control. However, his name is Chiwetel Ejiofor, and he'll definitely have to change that if he intends to scale the ladder in Hollywood.Julia Roberts deserves a medal. In an important supporting role she's allowed herself to be thoroughly deglamorized. It fits. She's the mother of a young college student. But she's done more than accept unflattering grooming. She adds to the effect by measures such as folding her lips together and projecting an impression of toothlessness and age. Good for her, a beacon for all of us aged and toothless citizens."
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.5256,2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"I have read some of the reviews about this movie, regarding a remake of a Spanish movie, and no clue that this was a remake.For a movie I haven't heard anything about, I gave it ago based on the actors in the movie.Pleasantly surprised at the gripping, compelling storyline. The heartbreak and suspense, as well as the thriller aspect of the movie, with that forever twist that I search for in movies. As The usual Suspects being one of my ultimate favourite movies of all time, I found that the storyline flowed well, it wasn't drawn out to the point you get bored and want to switch to another movie. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend watching."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,0.9596,2017-01-22 00:00:00,4,"The original was so good. I mean really good and I'm happy I already knew it, because this remake would have ruined it all. Underwhelming would be an understatement. It really takes a good concept tries to run with it, but never really touches the viewer or gets you to the edge of your seat. Well maybe once or twice, but even then the moments were much bigger in the original.And it's not down to the actors, they do their best to convey emotions and carry the story as good as they can. But just more or less copying the original (some minor tweaks, like the terrorist thread America was really afraid of after 9/11, which some would say is being used in a shameful or clever way, depending on your view of things), is not really helping the cause much. Watch the original! I beg you! There is a reason it was at the Oscars (they do get it right from time to time)"
" I Haven't Seen The Original and I'm Still Disappointed.
",-0.6202,-0.9908,2017-01-17 00:00:00,4,"An American remake of an Oscar winning film from Argentina with a decent cast misfires and bores the audience to death with a misguided effort. I've never seen the original film, but I know it has to be better than this wreck. In the aftermath of 9/11, the watch on terror is at an all-time high. Two counter terrorist agents, played by Julia Roberts and Chiwetel Ejiofor are called to a crime scene because it is suspiciously close to a mosque they are keeping tabs on. The crime scene involves a dead body in a dumpster and coincidentally the dead person is the daughter of Roberts. Ejiofor becomes obsessed with tracking down her killer. Plastic face Kidman also stars.The film is split between two timelines. 2002, when the body is discovered and more than a decade later when Ejiofor is still on the case, off the books. He's no longer part of the unit, but he seems to be the only one who cares about finding the guy who once got away. Ejiofor sells the obsession of the case, but fails to connect with Kidman when the film forces a love story between them. Kidman doesn't do much to help him in this situation, she delivers a wooden performance in an underwritten role.The film tries to be clever and pull a fast one on the viewer, but anyone who has seen a film before can connect the dots well before the film ever reveals anything. Poor writing aside, the director, Billy Ray doesn't seem to be able to thread a suspenseful case with this story. One scene in particular takes place at a baseball game and a chase ensues. How is this not even the little bit suspenseful? Poor camera work and editing come into play as well, they seem amateurish. At no point, did I care about either timeline, nor the character decisions. I can see an interesting story here and I can only assume it was told masterfully in the original film, here it is uninspired. A real shame, since American remakes haven't fared to well."
" Glossy but Indie-Leaning, Story out of Context
",0.0,-0.9869,2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"All the reviews I've read here compare this film to its progenitor, which is pointless to the film-goer. The first question must be, as with any film, is THIS creation any good? Well, it has its limitations, that's for sure. More of that below. But it does have something. There is some clunkiness, some awkwardness, some unease, that makes it more interesting than mere genre. How much of this is intentional, it's hard to tell, but that's part of the draw: it is quite unaffected.For a start we have Julia Roberts playing a tragic, frumpy, charmless plain sourpuss with dark bags under the eyes, cracked lips and no makeover. The neat part about this is that if you're as used as her to glinting those perfect teeth to the camera, this role isn't likely to be convincing. But she does pull it off, and it succeeds partly because we look into her eyes and see that, within, there is absence (is that what the title is about, by the way? it doesn't come across otherwise). We all think we know our Julia, glamour and presence, so when we see her like this we can readily feel her loss, and imagine her private journey into hell all the more. Take an unknown actress in the same role and you'd have to do half an hour's prior character development to get close to the same effect.Now Nicole Kidman and Chiwetel Ejiofor, the clumsy preppy princess and the black pauper, avoiding copulation for the duration. I'm not sure we glimpse how they feel or what they do, it's so understated it's invisible, and we have to fill in the gaps. Spoiler alert: it probably never happens. Or maybe it does, it's just offscreen. At the end the husband says Chiwetel's been in the marriage all the time. Not showing the passion on screen: we're definitely not playing this for the box office now are we? He walks her to her car. They like it, they do it again... Unless of course the film had come out twenty years earlier, in which case the studio would have cut the risky interracial. So is the editing and production timid, self-conscious, affected, innocent, playful, teasing, post-modern ironic or just botched? Well it comes out unresolved, and it worked that way for me.There's some arty/independent touches to the general production too, including a garish single-take swoop into the LA baseball stadium that may be commonplace in the age of drones and CGI but is still more ambitious than the average Hollywood gloss thriller.And Alfred Molina as the DA. A much more acceptable rendition than the usual growling apparatchik in this role, but Alfred is still playing a stereotype of himself, I fear. This is fine for the picture but bad for Alfred, who deserves better, and has proved it when allowed.Finally, unfortunately, we come to the story. There are good aspects of it, that's for sure. We have a striking morality play in which the personal tragic consequences of consumption by hatred, and inability to forgive, are played to the female hilt, with consequences that eventually spill out of her own torment and tortures into the death of a fellow cop, a segment that is again thoroughly understated compared to the genre norm.But as to the central plot, I'm very sorry, but the postulate is preposterous and underdeveloped, this time in a way that doesn't work. Cop's daughter gets killed, but criminal is protected from pursuit because he is undercover working on the LA 911 plot? No,sorry. There are NO circumstances, including the terrified post-911 panic, when such a CONSIDERED conspiracy to prevent a murdering rapist - especially one who has perpetrated his deeds against one of the City's finest - from being brought to justice, would be contemplated in any Western liberal state that practises even imperfect, and sometimes somewhat corrupt, justice and equality under the law, let alone be tolerated by ANY police department. Repeat, no circumstances. This is such a strong and true instinct that it became impossible for me to suspend disbelief through the action, at which point I was left only with the consolation that perhaps it might just work if we reset to where justice for cop-family killers is less instinctive. Is there such a place ..."
" it just didn't have that intensity you need...
",0.0,0.8692,2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"for a good thriller. All the actors were OK, it was just that the movie lacked oomph or you might say excitement. Plus you could see when the twist was coming up. It wasn't that hard to predict. Two law enforcement officers are working on the terrorist unit. Then they find Jess's daughter dead in a trash bin by the mosque they are watching. Ray finally believes it was a snitch who did the murder that saw Jess's daughter at a work picnic. But others in the division want to protect the perp because he is an informant. And lawyer, Claire, has a thing for Ray.Then 13 years later, Ray thinks he has found the perp, even though he doesn't look like the original, but he says it's just plastic surgery?? Anyways Jess's looking haggard and Claire is still styling it. So the rest of the film is about finding out what really happened to the perp 13 years ago.FINAL VERDICT: Just not enough excitement or suspense. I think I'd say skip it."
