" Sadly a bad sequel
",-0.743,-0.3188,2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,"I didn't like this sequel, despite really enjoying Finding Nemo. They sort of repeated the same thing and tried to get likes off some member berries. Not for me."
" Nicely crafted
",0.4404,0.9042,2021-03-17 00:00:00,10,I think this is excellent movie in terms of technicalities and story I don't know why people are saying this is a boring movie but I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Overall a excellent movie. In my opinion must watch
" Kinda obnoxious
",-0.4033,-0.3415,2021-03-03 00:00:00,5,All of the characters are kinda annoying in this one except Marlin. They all repeat their point over and over. The first movie was much more heart felt.
" Charming
",0.5859,0.9682,2021-02-13 00:00:00,7,"The characters were great, each with their own distinct personalities. These include: Hank the Octopus who only had 7 tentacles, Destiny the Whale Shark who was short sighted, Bailey the Beluga Whale who had problems with his echolocation, and many more interesting creatures, many of whom could have their own spin-off. The voice cast is a terrific collection of voices. There are jokes aimed towards the kids, but also some subtlety aimed toward the adults. The general plot isn't that original, it's similar to the original Finding Nemo. It's an adventure movie about a character trying to get home. Sometimes there is silliness and comedy, and sometimes there are sad moments. Its main positives are its characters and its use of various emotions. On the whole, an amazing sequel where the main character from the original is pushed aside and the supporting character take over like in Monster Inc, Cars 3 and to some extent Incredibles 2. I wonder why they do that but it's doesn't matter as it's very effective."
" it's ok
",0.296,0.3476,2021-02-13 00:00:00,7,"Not as bad as it's made outLove Albert Brooks.It is all stuff we have seen before, which made for a slow start. When the movie arrives at the aquarium, we finally see something new, but it is only mildly entertaining. At that point Dory's story-line really takes off, which I found to be really sad and overly serious.In the original movie, Dory was quirky, and full of heart and sweetness; she almost personified optimism. Her character does not change in this movie, but the directors' approach toward her mental affliction does. What was a silly but funny affliction in the first movie is now treated as a serious disability. We now see Dory and the characters around her sad, confused, lost, and really scared most of the time. I completely understand what they were going for in this film, especially for families dealing with special needs family members. At the same time, this movie never makes the strong emotional impacts of many other Pixar films. It's more of a downer than a tearjerker."

" One of the better Pixar sequels
",0.4404,0.9662,2021-01-18 00:00:00,9,"Toy Story 2 aside Pixar struggles with justifying their fellow-ups and the sequels have an odd relationship to the first films. Cars 2 has very little connection to Cars 1 in tone or theme. Monsters University basically doesn't link up to the first film. etc. This film is the most organic and worthwhile follow-up. I like it almost as much of the first film. The animation is still just gorgeous and you can once again get a painting from basically any shot. Best of all the film largely doesn't repeat beats or ideas from the first film. The trip across the ocean is much quicker in this film.The new characters-Hank and Dory's parents-fit in well with the prior cast and the voice work is again top notch. DeGeneres manages to find a real depth to Dory and manages to make the memory problem not annoying. Likewise, O'Neil is just great as the crusty, cautious, cynical Hank. Levy and Keaton hit the needed core to pull at the heartstrings.In some ways I like the story of this film more than the first one. This one really lives in Dory's disability and it is built around demonstrating how the characters cope with it. As a person with a learning disability I found this take on the material comforting to see it handled with such care. And the shot of the Dory's parents' work to get her back to them is most moving moment in either film."
" A new masterpiece from Pixar studios
",0.6249,0.9628,2020-12-24 00:00:00,9,"This sequel is very nice. It was made in such a decent way for kids. Even some of the adults will probably enjoyed it. This movie have a great looking CGI animation style with a whole new interesting effects. The design of the background and different objects is so colourful. Also the characters have a strong build personalities. They are fun to watch.
Finding Dory is an incredible movie for the whole family."
" 2040 readers, I warn you to stay away from this!
",-0.1759,0.9942,2020-12-07 00:00:00,3,"I feel I MUST write this review even if it's years after release because since Finding Nemo was a classic, someone 2 decades from now, even born as I write this, needs to be warned. Kid, there are so many other worthy films to watch! Don't waste 2 hours of your life!OK, how to put this: Everything that made Finding Nemo so charming is not in this commercially written fluff hack and it's not original in any way. The best way to judge this film is that if, on its own, would it be worth watching? If you're in love with the original characters and just feel you MUST see them, then by all means, watch whatever nonsense they're in. Let's review what the original film had this this doesn't:1) Original characters who were all charming in their own right. None of the new characters in FD are interesting. Even the human dentist and his horrid niece in FN had some charm to them. The humans in FD are much like Non-Player-Characters.2) The original had pacing, character development, timing, humor, and a script that felt like a cohesive story. That's all missing here. The original felt like it was ""filmed"" by a clever director. The action and dialogue is clunky and worse: BORING.3) The original felt real. Not only were the graphics immersive but the story itself felt plausible while this is much like a video game with the characters doing things that appear unrealistic. In the original, even an adult could feel like the hilarious events in the film could happen (at least on film) but in this, it's as real as a cartoon. As a cartoon/video game, I felt no connection to the plot.4) Did I mention BORING? The film spends most of its time in the fish rescue center in different habitats but unlike finding Nemo full of wonder about the ocean and Austrialia, we feel stuck IN A MUSEUM? Don't get me wrong, being in a good museum can be fun but imagine if you were stuck there for hours without an idea of what to do. That's a lot like this film.My 4 year old enjoyed hearing the characters talk and going from room to room much like I suppose she enjoys watching me play video games. But for me, there was no joy in this film. If you loved the characters, I suppose just having them talk about what they ate for lunch is worth the price of admission.If you have NOTHING BETTER TO DO in the future, then by all means, watch this. Considering how messed up 2020 has been, perhaps lousy sequels really are the best someone will get out of life by then."
" A fine little movie
",0.2023,-0.5414,2020-11-30 00:00:00,7,"Finding Dory isn't great. The writing is so-so, and the plot feels a bit repetitive. Still, it's a fine movie."
" It's OK
",0.4466,0.9583,2020-11-28 00:00:00,5,"If you have little kids, Finding Dory is a cute little movie.
However, if you like to follow the plot of a film, Finding Dory definitely disappoints a bit. One can easily get a feeling of déjà vu from seeing what is essentially the same thing as the original movie: a fish goes lost and, despite the vastness of the ocean, we follow a group of people trying to find the fish and bring them back to their home. The basic bone structure of the story is nothing more than a gender-swapped, mentally confused version of Finding Nemo (and every bit as slow-moving and bland, in my opinion). Sure, Dory is cute and Ellen, as always, does a fantastic job in the role, but it's not something we really needed. It doesn't really offer much of value that the original didn't offer. Finding Dory is the Home Alone 2 of the Pixar world: It's a cut-and-paste film with just enough changed to give off the guise of originality and inspiration (difference being that Home Alone 2 actually manages, in its own way, to be more fun than the original).
This movie is good for kids, and it's good for a little bit of a nostalgia trip for those of you who, like me, grew up with Finding Nemo. But it suffers from a major issue that even Finding Nemo (a film I've been critical of in the past) didn't: it's just so forgettable. Similar to Toy Story 4.
I still maintain that Pixar hasn't made a ""bad"" film (that I've seen, anyway), but this is one of the weakest offerings they've given us thus far."
" Not Bad
",0.431,-0.2924,2020-11-25 00:00:00,7,Films not bad but nowhere near as good as the first.
" Unexpectedly Good
",0.4404,0.9948,2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Pixar has a long list of beloved movies, and several of them have gotten sequels over the years. Finding Nemo isn't exactly the first movie that comes to mind when talking about Pixar movies that deserve sequels, but it's easy to understand why it was selected. It's a great movie, and it is remembered well as one of Pixar's best movies. Still, it doesn't exactly lend itself to having a follow-up, especially when people had been waiting on other Pixar sequels like Incredibles 2, which didn't happen until 2018. As the title would suggest, this one isn't about Marlin and Nemo, but rather Dory, who was a comic relief in Finding Nemo.The premise is that Dory can't remember her family and sets out to find them. In the process, she ends up being taken to an aquarium in California, while Nemo and Marlin follow her. This little blue fish is remembered for having short term memory loss, which was played for laughs in the first movie, but is taken quite seriously here. Dory is given a very nice character arc, on a quest of self-discovery. She is accompanied by an octopus named Hank, who's missing a leg. He's mostly a comic relief character, and a good one at that. Most of the other characters are just kind of there, but that's alright - the focus is on Dory. Like most, if not all Pixar movies, the ending is very touching, predictable though it may be.The animation is Pixar quality. Pixar is perhaps the greatest animation studio in the world, and their animation shows it. Everything looks spectacular, especially underwater.As far as Pixar goes, it's one of the weakest. That isn't quite an insult though, as the bar for Pixar films is much higher than it is for other animated movies. That being said, it's nowhere near as good as the first movie. It is, however, a pity that this made a billion dollars while Inside Out and Coco didn't. It's also funny that Finding Dory, the sequel no one asked for, is better than Incredibles 2, the sequel everyone asked for."
" Good
",0.4404,0.3844,2020-11-14 00:00:00,7,"Finding Dory is a surprisingly GOOD sequel that captures the spirit of the original with beautiful animation, but a pretty lazy story that rehashed the plot of the original and some downgraded characters. I will start off with the film's biggest weakness, its predictability and lack of focus. The film would mostly juggle between Dory's past to get repetitive and unfocused very quickly. The story is predictable once Pixar rehashed the plot of the first. But, its still can stand well on its own with some emotional scenes and fresh comedy. Not the best Pixar film or the best of the year, bit still a well crafted and well made feature."
" A Worthy Sequel
",0.4404,0.672,2020-11-13 00:00:00,8,"I watched this film when it released in theaters with half of my school so at the time I was leaving the target audience of Pixar Movies kids aged (5-12). I still had a good time I see some people writing how it's ""not a worthy successor"" but they fail to mention that once you think back and re-watch Finding Nemo it's not one of the best Pixar movies the animation was stunning but that's it, the plot and acting were not incredible by any means (I committed blasphemy I know). In this movie Dory is searching for her parents which fits the plot and her amnesia killed this movie from being rated higher (I'm soo tired of amnesia characters and plots it's super cheap story telling). I still recommend checking out this family flick."
" Lacks the magic from the first
",0.0,0.2263,2020-11-08 00:00:00,5,I did enjoy this film and It doesn't feel the same. It didn't capture the magic from the first one. The new characters also feel boring.
" Just Okay!
",0.2942,0.9991,2020-11-02 00:00:00,6,"Finding Dory is the sequel to the now 13 year old film, Finding Nemo, which is hailed by some to be one of the best animated films ever. So how does the sequel follow up to such an iconic film? Well I'd say it is a pretty good follow up to a great movie. The film features a strong cast of voice actors including the returning voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, as well as newcomers such as Ed O'Neill, Kaitlin Olson and Idris Elba, who are all fantastic in this film. The movie takes a place a year after the events of Finding Nemo, catching up with Marlin, Dory and Nemo, as Dory begins to have flashbacks to her past, which sends her on a hunt to find her parents. Going into this movie I didn't really know what to expect, a large part of me, didn't have any desire to this film, I knew it would be good cause it's Pixar, but I felt this was a sequel no one was really asking for and felt like nothing more than another cash grab by Pixar, similar to what Cars 2 and Monsters University were. And though at points thats what this sequel felt like, luckily the film felt like it had a proper story to tell and could stand on its own. My biggest worry going into this film was that there creators were taking a side character and making it a protagonist and usually that doesn't work, particularity when the character is one that is of comic relief but this movie manages to pull it off (for the most part) and that is due to inclusion of Hank the octopus who acts as Dory's character foil, similar to what Dory was to Marlin the original film. Though Hank was great, he never came to be as good as Marlin was with his sarcasm and that is how I feel about most of this film. It is definitely good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't great. Apart from the few scenes that packed an emotional punch, I didn't feel a lot during this movie, it didn't have as high of stakes nor did it feel as grand as Finding Nemo did. That may be due to the film taking place in one location for most of the movie, as with Nemo Dory and Marlin's journey took them right across the ocean, encountering unique characters and crazy situations, it felt long and adventurous, like the pair endured so much just to save Nemo. However because this new adventure only takes place in one day and the journey to the aquatic centre took a matter of mere seconds because of the sea turtle travel, the end result didn't feel as epic nor impressive. I would have much rather seen the journey to the centre rather than having the trio travel with Crush across the ocean to their destination, maybe he would have served best if they met along the way in a fun cameo, rather than right at the beginning. The only other complaint I have about this movie, is that the ending was sort of a cop out, I felt like it would have went in a serious ballsy direction but rather it took the easy route leading to me predict exactly how the ending would play out, also the climax to the film was a little goofy but then again the little green alien dues drove the Pizza Planet truck in Toy Story 2, so I cant knock one film for its unbelievability if I give it a pass to another movie. Other than that this a good, fun sequel, although it isn't quite clear exactly why this movie had to be made, when the final few minutes were playing out before the credits, I felt a sense of relief and that the chapter to this story will finally be closed in a nice way, that leaves everyone, including myself, happy. Overall I did enjoy this film, and didn't view it as a total step back in the wrong direction for Pixar, I just hope that even though Pixar's slate for the next few years are sequel heavy, that they wont turn out to be similar to Monsters University. I do recommend this film, it is a good Pixar film and with that being said Finding Dory gets a 6/10"
" Pixar has done it again!
",0.0,0.9728,2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"Finding Dory has the perfect balance between flashbacks, callbacks, emotion, adventure and running jokes; that doesn't get boring or seem like they are dragging on for too long. This movie and it's characters made you believe that you were helping Dory find her parents and you believed that you were part of the movie. It is a beautifully crafted, movie with incredible cinematography and direction - I could clearly see the amount of time and effort it took to get this movie made; I'm very happy that they waited such a long time and didn't rush in with a sequel that would've been very disappointed; but maybe they shouldn't wait so long next time.I could not review this movie without mentioning the performances by all of the voice actors; especially Ellen DeGeneres' as Dory; I say performance because the amount emotion and strength that went into was incredible. She made you feel every emotional Dory was feeling, whether she was happy or sad or crying at times. Ellen DeGeneres has said in many interviews that she was actually crying while reading certain lines and I felt that throughout some of the most key scenes. Her performance is one of the best voice performances I have ever witnessed and I honestly believe that she deserves an Oscar nomination for her role as Dory."
" Outstanding 3D Animation

",0.1511,0.9793,2020-09-03 00:00:00,7,"This sequel repeats the same formula from first film. Characters gone missing and protagonist has to find them. It's fast paced, tons of adventures just like the first movie, but it felt very repetitive. The first half was slightly poor, nothing interesting happenned, the adventures were simple, but in the second half the adventures turned more crazy and then it became great. It even reminded me of ""Over the Hedge"".
Anyway, this film clearly tries to replicate the success formula of the first film, it kind of succeeds. It's fun, enjoyable, adventure movie, though not as memorable as the first film."

I suffer from short-term remembory loss.""The movie may not feel like the magnum opus of Pixar movie as Finding Nemo was, but it still has enough fun and humor to qualify as a good movie to watch. While this movie is one that focuses less on heart and more on fun and adventure, there are still moments that appeal to the emotions. They mainly occur with the childhood flashbacks that Dory has from time to time. Every time I saw a scene with a baby Dory and her parents, I found myself lost in the cuteness and just couldn't bear to think that something bad is going to happen to them. I also felt inspired whenever Dory, young or old, could overcome something without being limited by memory problems. It just goes to show that determination wins the day no matter what stands in the way. It's a movie that will keep you smiling from beginning to end."
" Decent prequel
",0.0,0.9146,2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,This film is a long-awaited prequel to the original Finding Nemo (2003). It is more colourful and light-hearted which gives it a different style but it is still good. The new settings and characters are very lifelike and engaging. Dory's backstory is not something that interested many viewers originally but it is treated with great emotion here.

" Finding Dory (2016)
",0.0,0.9977,2020-07-20 00:00:00,9,"A sweet, fun, and enjoyable sequel- Finding Dory may not be as good as the original, but is a more than worthy successor to one of the greatest animated films of all time. Ellen DeGeneres and many other supporting cast members return as their roles from the original, including Albert Brooks and Marlin, and Andrew Stanton as Crush. The return of the beloved characters from the original is done quite well, with it never seeming too forced, but also drawing attention that this is a sequel to the original events. It's plot is a little on the thin side, with the film seeming more like a map than having a true script, but nevertheless is is still very enjoyable to watch, and quite entertaining. My favorite thing about the film is Ed O'Neill as Hank the Octopus, whose chemistry with Dory provides for some hilarious and amusing situations, and whose presence I always enjoyed on screen. It does seem a bit corny at times, and a bit formulaic, but Finding Dory makes the best of its problems and provides for a simple, but enjoyable animated sequel that I wouldn't mind watching again.
My Rating: 9/10"
" Okay?
",0.2263,-0.8581,2020-07-19 00:00:00,4,Are the reviews on this movie bought and paid for? This movie really was awful. Pixar has fallen so far from its high tower. The whale shark was absolutely stupid.

" Finding Dory
",0.0,0.9192,2020-07-02 00:00:00,5,"Andrew Stanton, John Lasseter, Bob Peterson, Jeremy Lasky & Thomas Newton came back together after thirteen years to make a prequel to Finding Nemo, and it just didn't pay off that well. The first set was great! Stanton did all the right things to drag us in, and want more. As for the rest of the film, it was slower paced because there was much more going on this time around. On the downside, I felt as if Stanton got a little lazy, and borrowed some content from the first film, so a few scenes just felt unbalanced. The major downfall I had with this film, I can't have Dory as my main protagonist!!! She serves much better as a side character; her character is a close comparison to Mater, just not as annoying. It did the same thing Cars 2 did, and they both flopped.I can truly appreciate the effort the team put in, into creating new and original characters, but some of them were hit and miss. The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson & new comer Victoria Strouse, didn't have as much charisma throughout, as the first one did, having pretty bad jokes, and just lacked heart that the first film spewed cranked out.The one thing that was better than the first film, was the cinematography and animation. The lights and darks, the texture in everything, to the fish, to the water, to the sunlight, was just spectacular, and breathtaking!I usually stay away from mentioning the endings, unless they really mean something, but this ending made this film plummet real fast. It was just too over the top, and tried to flesh out too much, because they realize they overstuffed the narrative to begin with.Overall, Finding Dory may not have been as fresh as the first, and took FOREVER to release, but it wasn't as bad as some of the other trash we got a few years ago."
" Better than nemo
",0.4404,0.2006,2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,Idk I think this story is better than nemo's. 'Cause it is less sad and its well written
" Good
",0.4404,0.9908,2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Right from the start, it is possible to notice the structural change implemented in Finding Dory: the film starts with a flashback, with the little fish dememorial beside his parents and learning to deal with his constant forgetfulness. In addition to historically situating the new protagonist, the opening also serves to correlate this sequence with the original film. That's when we know that the new adventure takes place exactly one year after Nemo's rescue.The presence of flashbacks is very important in this new film: it is through them that Dory, little by little, receives clues about who they were and where their parents are. In addition to dealing with the past explicitly, Finding Dory reverses the proposal seen in the original film: if before an overprotective father left desperately in search of his son, now it is the daughter who is looking for her parents. In both cases, the need to have the family around is the main motivation - remember, Pixar is a Disney company, with all the merits and demerits it brings. However, if Finding Nemo shone with originality, its continuation is extremely dependent on the elements already known to the general public.It is clear that issues with the whale and Dory's constant forgetfulness are present once again, as well as Marlin's always worried air, now relegated to the post of supporting (and sometimes forgotten in the story itself, along with Nemo). Well-known characters, such as the hippie-shaped turtle, appear in small spikes. As much as such ideas even yield some fun sequences, they always sound like something reheated. The same joke is insisted, changing only the context in which it is presented.Such dependence is made even more explicit by the fact that the new characters do not stand out so much. If the Hank octopus even has an interesting side due to the dubiousness of posture, it is also wide open that his choice had a lot to do with the need for locomotion out of the water of Dory herself (in juggling that does not always convince, say in passing) . The itinerary is also concerned with instructing minors about marine fauna, as shown by biological curiosities scattered here and there and the presence of the beluga Bailey, with her powerful ""natural sonar"". In other words, there is a constant concern to have fun and also to transmit messages, whether emotional - connection with the family - or educational - the setting in the California aquarium is another example.Originally, Finding Dory is in just two moments: in the brilliant sequence of the ""touching tank"", where reality is presented from the perspective of the beings who live there (an inversion of the point of view similar to the aquarium in the office, in Finding Nemo); and in the contrast formed by the shark Destiny and the aforementioned Bailey, involving questions of vision. In addition, they are the same situations already known, presented by an impressive quality of animation - note the difference in brightness at the bottom of the sea, depending on how deep the characters are.I liked this criticism of AdoroCinemaFilm reviewed on June 14, 2020."

",0.0,0.9378,2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"I may be one of the few people out there that doesn't love Finding Nemo, it was ok but it didn't really do anything for me. So, going into Finding Dory I had no real expectations.First and foremost, it is GORGEOUS. The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.Most importantly though is the story. Dory's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.As an aside, I had avoided seeing this one until I had finally seen Finding Nemo and while I would recommend seeing Nemo, Finding Dory does stand alone as it's own film."
" Worth the reboot!
",0.2942,0.9843,2020-06-03 00:00:00,7,"This was a great adventure taking us back into a much loved world of Nemo. Finding Dory, delivered in many ways that made a great sequel where others have failed. It doesn't try to make the same jokes. By focusing on Dory and her short term memory loss, the story felt really fresh but still relevant as it absolutely nails the graphics of under sea life. The visuals are incredible and have no doubt given children across the world a sense of wonder at what lives under the sea. The story was interesting and it did a good job of introducing new characters that were helpful and not annoying, unlike something like Toy Story 4 where the new characters got too much screen time and drew away from the overall storyline.The second half of the film does struggle a bit when they are based in the aquarium and definitely gets way too far fetched when it comes to Dory and an octopus driving a truck down the motorway! But despite this it really hits home with a heartfelt message when Dory finally finds her parents as they are bringing back shells. It's hard to hold back the tears in this moment, and again you animation has come so far that it came make humans cry at the story of fish - it would seem odd to be staring at a fish bowl and begin to cry and be overwhelmed at the fish family! They really personify and humanise the characters. The whole movie really tugs at that question deep within us all of where do we come from, of knowing your ancestry. It's no wonder that so many people travel all over the world to make the same links as Dory does.Overall its a great side story. It was never going to be as great as the original, but it is definitely well made and adds rather than takes away from the whole story."

Finding Nemo was so great for it's heartbreaking journey of a father trying to find his lost son. Finding Dory is literally just Dory thinking ""hey I wonder where my parents are."" I get that large amounts of emotion are triggered by its ending, but the entire film doesn't feel very necessary because of greatly finding nemo ended.
But overall it is an enjoyable film with some very funny and exciting scenes. The introduction of new characters was great since they were well written. The ending scene of the film is quite funny because of its absurdity which I think is what they were trying to go for.
I enjoyed this film, but will take Finding Nemo over it in a heartbeat."

I was pleasantly surprised by a film clearly made for children but which nonetheless has heart and warmth and generally veers on the right side of sentimentality. Ellen DeGeneres wouldn't have been my first choice for lead role but she makes a good job of a fine part, and the story is generally interesting and character-focused, which makes it rewarding.

",-0.3182,0.9923,2019-12-04 00:00:00,9,"Surprisingly enough, Finding Dory managed to impress me even more than Finding Nemo did many years ago. It's palpable that the high-quality Pixar always delivers is still present in strong form. Finding Dory tells its story in an imaginative way, filled with clues and flashbacks that help Dory decipher her own origins. It's a type of wild adventure that only animated pictures can offer that is truly satisfying to watch, it's a thrilling ride so fantastically translated to the screen, the animation is precious. The newly added character, the octopus (well, septipus) Hank is nothing short of incredible. First off, it was greatly voiced by Ed O'Neill and his octopus mobility was perfectly captured, I was tremendously impressed every time Hank was moving around like a ninja or a trapeze artist with such effortlessness that it was engrossing to watch.The film itself is highly entertaining, it does not bore nor tire at any particular moment, it is carried by a strong visual narrative that manages to keep your eyes on the screen at all times. The visuals go along really well with the story of Nemo and Marlin trying to find Dory, and Dory trying to find her parents.The scene standout for me is without a doubt the truck scene where it falls to the river, freeing the fish. That is simply a stunning and inspiring scene, done so cleverly that is no surprising that it came from the masters at Pixar.Check out this wonderful sequel to a Pixar classic, you may even like it a bit more, or maybe not, depends on you. But rest assure that you will have a great time with this fine animated film."

What bothers me about this film? Two things; a completely irrelevant cash grab and it is goddamn boring. First of all, I absolutely love finding nemo. Nearly everything about it is great, including the ending which capped of the film well. No Sequel Needed.
And sure the film isn't painfully boring, but the plot gets really really repetitive and you wonder why it's so long
I blame this in part on the setting, which is almost incomparable to the ocean in finding nemo. Each set piece in that film was spectacular, and here we have a couple of animal enclosures.
This might be good for you, but if you are huge fan of the first film like I am then you will be sorely disappointed"

" Finding Dory, Losing Entertainment
",0.0516,0.9947,2019-07-17 00:00:00,5,"These days, it's too much to ask for a genuine Pixar gem. The glory days are long past. The creative fire that sustained the animation studio's best films is out. We won't get another Finding Nemo. But when an ill-gotten Nemo sequel comes along, is it too much to ask for something reasonably entertaining? Finding Dory retains the talent from the 2003 Pixar classic, but the 2016 sequel, like others before and after it, drops the passion. Sure, it's passably drawn, and it gave me some chuckles, but It's not as funny, not nearly as charming, and simply not as good as its predecessor.Finding Dory purports to have come from an original story by Nemo director Andrew Stanton, who also happens to have directed Dory. Honestly, I find the credit dubious. There's a good story here, but original? I don't know. In Finding Dory, a fish is taken off to a human world, other fish come to its aid, and things are wrapped up in an affirming message of love. This time, however, it's Dory that needs finding. Whatever, if Stanton wants to deliver the same beats in Nemo 2, that's all well and good by me. We know the story works. I'm just here for a good time, so shoot. Now if only Dory could have delivered the same personality, humor, or heart.Dory doesn't get those notes right. It's not a lack of effort, really. Finding Dory introduces new characters like Ed O'Neill's camouflaging octopus, Hank, and a whale shark voiced by Kaitlin Olson, but they are forgettable. It stages new escapes, but they aren't very exciting. There are new emotional beats featuring Dory and her parents, but they don't ring very true. The new elements of Finding Dory, as welcome as they are, are pale. With the exception of Ellen ""Why doesn't she do more movies"" DeGeneres, the voice acting is lifeless, the character designs are obvious and kiddy, and the writing and direction seem flat out lazy. Case in point, the humor. I'll admit to chuckling one or two times during Finding Dory, but I never laughed. Half the jokes are recycled from Nemo, and the rest are uninspired guesses at what makes for good cartoon comedy. The reality is, I spent more time cringing than smiling. Why they decided to take a hilarious one-shot gag from Finding Nemo (Dory's whale speak) and stretch it out for an entire film, way past its breaking point, is beyond me. But it's not just the incessant whale noises that left me grinding my teeth. What about a wacky bird that exists solely to transport Marlin and Nemo around? Not funny, not memorable, not voiced by Geoffrey Rush.If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times, when the passion isn't there, the product suffers. Like Cars 2, Monster's University, and Incredibles 2, Finding Dory is good ole' apathetic Pixar. Not as shockingly Disney Junior-ish as Monsters U, Finding Dory doesn't quite qualify as a ""bad"" Pixar movie. The animation is lovely to look at, and the settings are colorful and detailed. It's a nice little world they cooked up in this film, and I can't say I didn't enjoy being there. That said, there is a real lack of entertainment value in Finding Dory, which coasts along a familiar track while sloppily throwing together some ""funny"" new characters, ""exciting"" new situations, and a ""message"" about family. I came into the movie with open arms. I had absolutely no expectations that it would approach Nemo's greatness. All I wanted was a fun afternoon at the movies. And still, I left Finding Dory in an indifferent funk.55/100"
" More of a Dory than its predecessor
",0.0,0.9964,2019-07-07 00:00:00,7,"After missing out on this film in high school, I got to view it while flying on Finnair. I will say that Finding Nemo is a movie that I can view several times without getting bored, especially from its phenomenal animation. But now that we're here, how does its successor hold it up?The story does continue with great humor and the use of uneven pacing to its advantage in the action and emotional scenes, though plenty of its ideas (especially the squid chase scene) feel replicated from FN. I do enjoy the new characters very much, especially the clever visual riddles Hank provides, the different kind of heart provided by Jenny and Charlie, and the charming voice acting. I do feel that additional development of Dory's character was a nice touch. From her flashbacks to how her STML is not universal, most additions were not unnecessary, which is the quality a sequel should have. The animation is improved as well, particularly in the land scenes with the extra detail added to the humans and objects. It captures the feeling that each species is what they are supposed to be, from the behavior of the otters to the fluidity of Hank and the squid. It's kind of a given seeing how Pixar has generally top-notch computers, though I cannot stress enough how gleaming a standard it continues to set.If you can get past how this movie and Finding Nemo have somewhat similar plot executions, then I am confident you'll enjoy it. It has the humor, action, and heart that Pixar rarely produces a dud with, and animation that somehow upgrades the already excellent animation of FN. Besides emotion, parents should also watch for some more intense scenes, for they might be paced a tad too fast for children."

" Solid if expected
",0.1531,0.9902,2019-06-15 00:00:00,8,"This review contains spoilers.Finding Dory is a computer animated movie that premiered in 2016. The movie is directed by Andrew Stanton. The story is written by Andrew Stanton with the screenplay by both Andrew Stanton and Victoria Strouse. The movie stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, and Hayden Rolence. The movie is a follow-up/spin off of Finding Nemo. Dory, the forgetful regal blue tang, searches for her parents.It has been thirteen years since the first installment in this franchise. Finding Dory has been a long awaited sequel with many of the younger fans of the first movie having grown up. This movie needed to appeal to kids and the older audience. Does this movie appeal to both audiences? I would say that it does. The movie is similar to the first movie by having its themes be something that all audiences can relate to. The movie has great thrills for all audiences. However, this does not match the original's feel.Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks reprise their roles of Dory and Marvin respectively. The two voice actors continue doing a good job in this movie. The movie uses the characters to their best but the originality and freshness from the first movie is lost in Finding Dory. This does not make Finding Dory an awful movie. It simply makes Finding Dory a movie that is more predictable and expected. There are not many massive twists or introductions.The entire sequence in the aquarium is awesome. This sequence has Dory with an octopus trying to escape. The computer animation and dialogue across this sequence is great to watch. It also brought back the idea of children that do not understand their actions might kill fish. The entire sequence is fun to watch but it felt like it took the themes from Finding Nemo rather than creating something new.Like the first movie, the sequel sets a high standard for animation and effects. There is much to appreciate in this movie from a technical standpoint. All of the characters are well animated and the scenes themselves are well directed. It made for an experience that is worthy of the Pixar Animation name.I would recommend 'Finding Dory.' This is a solid family friendly movie.Grade: B"
" ""Fin""-tastic Sequel! (Pun-intended)
",0.0,0.984,2019-06-12 00:00:00,9,"For a sequel, this movie is actually really good. The voice acting is still great, the animation is more impressive than ever before, Dory's character development has increased, and the humor is still hilarious. We get to see Nemo, Marlin, Dory, the Tank Gang (even while their roles are rather small), and the sea turtles once again after such a long time. Not only that, but we were also introduced to new characters, such as Hank the cranky but good-hearted octopus, Destiny the nearsighted whale shark, Bailey the beluga whale with the inability to echolocate because of his big head until the big climax, the sea lions, Becky the offbeat, kooky loon, and of course Dory's parents.There are also hilarious moments, like Hank hijacking the van, a fish suddenly sneezing after saying ""I feel fantastic!"", that running gag where Fluke and Rudder shout ""OFF! OFF! OFF!"", Destiny and Bailey making puns out of each other's names, and the entire touch pool scene.It's been 13 years since the original movie was released and I waited so patiently for it, and I gotta admit that it was worth it. Dory's backstory was really emotional, and it was great for those who have remembered or forgotten something, and it plays like a big adventure just like the original movie. It was kinda harsh that Marlin blamed Dory for almost getting Nemo attacked by a squid, which she didn't remember, and told him to just forget. Ouch! Otherwise, great sequel! :)9.5/10"

However a nitpick towards the Nemo voice actor, obviously its a different kid voicing him but its too noticeably different but it really doesn;t matter. Pixar takes on a character that wasn't really interesting in the original finding Nemo, and makes something pretty great. The movie has an emotional story line and manages to make Dory likable and slightly interesting. The main problem with this movie is that it's just another Pixar movie, it's really nothing unique, there's no tension, there's a scene involving a chase with Marlon and Dory and it mirrors the original chase with the angler-fish in the original Finding Nemo except it has no tension. You never feel like anything is going to happen to these characters and it makes it tension-less. The movie makes up for that however by being fun, and it does not feel incredibly long, it feels quite short. The plot is quite simple but heartwarming with some fantastic music at the end. Overall the movie is very well made highly recommend, it just feels like another Pixar movie, not what could've potentially been done with a Finding Nemo sequel."

" Great Animated Film Concering a Difficult Character Study
",0.3818,0.8824,2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"30 June 2016. ""Find Dory"" stands out because of the of difficulty of developing a script that focuses primarily on a character who has short-term and long term memory loss. In some ways, like the challenging script of ""50 First Dates"" (2004) where Drew Barrymore plays Lucy Whitmore, a human who also suffers from memory loss, in a live action comedy, the ability to maintain interest and a delicate balance of respect for such characters is definitely not easy to accomplish. Nevertheless in both instances, both comedies accomplish a continuing series of fumbles and ironic come backs that offer both humor and sympathy for their female characters. ""Finding Dory"" offers up some great comic lines, a fast and involving pace with captivating and emotive interest. More involving with its extensive character portrayal more so than the classic ""The Incredibles"" (2004) as a close collection of family members, the audience gets to experience a more personal, intimate voyage much like those found in the animated dog move ""Bolt"" (2008), the lonely sci fi robotic waste collector ""Wall*e (2008), even the live musical drama ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001), the lonely adventure of a woman in ""Wild"" (2014) or the personal blacker demons of ""Black Swan"" (2010).Except for a rather abrupt and not fully developed scene regarding Dory's parents later in the movie which doesn't come across as smoothly, this animated film stands out for its compelling interesting pacing and engaging comedy revolving around a rather peculiar but very likable lead character."

The movie basically followed things almost exactly like the first film, and in a series that veils the fact that sometimes life is cruel and people are born with or develop problems along the way, life still just keeps chugging along.

",0.5859,0.9855,2018-10-18 00:00:00,10,"Wow. A sequel to Finding Nemo. When I first heard of this movie, I was very skeptical of its ability to be entertaining. For one, Finding Nemo is one of Pixar's best films. Everything from the visuals, to the story, to the ambient music was top notch creative design. To feel the emotions that this film is meant to evoke, you will have had to watch Finding Nemo, as it contains many aspects of Dory's younger self in an ambiguous form. Lots of moments in this movie make you think back to the first and say to yourself, ""ohhh that's why..."". There are lots of small points of humor that can be missed if one is not really paying attention, although most of them are quite obvious. The plot is amazingly fluid, at no point do you ever feel a pause or break in the story. One of those movies that it is hard to add commercials to if aired on TV. This is reflective of Dory's character in that she just keeps ""swimming"". Every obstacle she faces is taken in perfect stride, just as every scene in the movie flows from one to the next. And the music is so perfectly fit to the situations and story; it creates a real feeling of immersion that you can only really enjoy if you let the film play in front of you, instead of picking it apart as you watch. If anyone hasn't seen either movie, please watch both in order, feel the story as it happens, don't sit outside of it."
" It's Fine, but too Similar to the First
",0.1027,0.9986,2018-09-02 00:00:00,5,"It really isn't a bad movie, but it's much too close to the original without actually improving on anything from the first. The beautiful atmospheric presence of Finding Nemo was a big part of the movie. Those still shots that had close focus on Marlin and Dory in the first were a big part of what really drew many people in. It was stunning to look at and it offered a sense of calm while keeping the viewer engaged. It was also better paced and made the movie more about the journey with an overarching goal. Finding Dory somehow lacks that charm, in part because that whole part of atmospheric presence was skipped in favor of getting to the busier location in the California rehabilitation center within the first 30 or so minutes. It felt rushed when compared to the more relaxed feel of the first movie, even though there was a greater sense of urgency to reach the goal in the first movie. This one somehow lacked that same feel, probably because the circumstances for Dory when compared to Nemo are vastly different. Even Crush's scene in this movie was rushed to simply offer a convenient time skip to the next part of where most of the movie would take place, rather than using it as character development like in the first. It didn't offer the same build up to the ultimate goal. The characters were also somehow less engaging and memorable. Dory's friends from the Rehabilitation Center are likable, but not very memorable. They were more devicive to explain Dory's excentricities and less endearing than they could have been. Dory's parents are nice. They're well developed and likable. They are the better characters of this movie. Still, it's not enough to save the movie from mediocrity. Unfortunately, I have to liken this movie to that of Cars 2(and to clarify, I don't hate Cars 2), and Dory is like Mater. A great character in her own right(just how Mater is a great character in his own right), but not so great as a lead. There's something interesting there, just like there was in Cars 2, but it wasn't executed well enough to be interesting or likable. This movie really only fails in terms of execution of the story and, somehow, the presence. Even though they had newer equipment for this movie, with presumably better graphics and software, Finding Nemo looked more polished. It looked more complete. You could feel the dedication to the first movie and the desire to make it right. Finding Dory looked rushed and felt rushed by comparison. The concept was there. It just wasn't developed well enough to tell a great story."
" A rich movie!

And I'm very happy that the movie was just as I expected, and more actually.It has a big package of emotions! I literally felt a lot of emotions, I enjoyed, laughed, cried and smiled. It's hard to find such a decent movie, like Finding Dory!The animation improved very much, it's an eye-comforting animation, with its colors, details and the sea... Everything went very awesome with the animation!The sense of humor was so unique and funny.The story was so related and tight together, in a way that made clap for each chapter in this movie! It was so emotional and unique!The voices were very very excellent! The characters are memorable and great!So Finding Dory worth-ed waiting, with its surprising, emotional and funny story, Finding Dory deserves 10 stars out of 10!"

" Excellent fil to enjoy with the family
",0.7845,0.9799,2018-08-22 00:00:00,9,"Finding Dory is the sequel to the well-known film Finding Nemo. It is an animated adventure/comedy film directed by Andrew Stanton who was also the director of the first film a while back in 2003. It stars Ellen DeGeneres, among others.
 The movie is about Dory, a fish who suffers from short-term memory loss who remembers short clips of what it seems to be her past before she got lost in the ocean. As she travels back to find her family, she keeps remembering this memory that helps her find her way back.
 There are a lot of new characters in this movie. There's a grumpy septopus (he only has seven tentacles) who can mimic things, which is helpful for Dory to find her family. There's also a whale shark who can only see close objects. Moreover, also some old characters have come back
 I think this is a great movie to watch with your family. It is sometimes funny, sentimental and adventurous. The animations are so good that you feel like you are underwater. I recommend you watch it with your family or friends; I can assure you will have a great time!"

",0.2732,0.9415,2018-08-01 00:00:00,9,"After hitting rock bottom with the release of Cars 2 and the mostly disappointing Monster University, I'm happy to see how Pixar was able to capture the essence of what made Finding Nemo so memorable yet again. I always wondered where Dory came from and all that stuff. And how that journey was strung together is yet again filled with memorable characters both old and new. The flash backs used for Dory's steady recall of who her parents are and how she got away from them was a clever choice of narrative, because that was how it was supposed to be in ""Nemo"" about how Marlin lost his wife and children. It works so well in here because of the short-term memory loss of Dory.With that said, I must address a few problems with the movie. You see, I loved how both Nemo and Marlin figured out there escape plans in the first movie, and that is only occasionally the case in Finding Dory. Many times it just seemed like something just happened to go that way or that just happened be there. It made me feel like: ""oh, that was adequate"". But aside from that, it captured all the things that made me love the original, so all in all it is a solid movie."
" Ridiculous, not in a good way
",-0.6002,-0.809,2018-07-11 00:00:00,3,"This movie is about Dory, the sweet forgetful fish from Finding Nemo, finding her family. There is a very touching ""Pixar"" moment when this is resolved. But the rest of the movie...OK, we do not expect movies to be realistic. But we expect some level of plausibility. In Finding Nemo, a large portion of the movie is dedicated to planning how to get one fish out of a fish tank. In Finding Dory, every move the characters have to do (like getting from the ocean to a tank, or a tank to another tank) is about 100 times more difficult, and is solved with about 1/100th of the effort. There was the same problem with dreadful Cars 2: they feel the need to ""up"" the action, to the point that the amazing is commonplace. There are no highs and lows, no tension, just wall to wall actions for the kids. And to paraphrase one of the good Pixar movies: ""When every action in the movie is super... nothing is."" Great if you're with kids under about 10. But if you're older and want a nostalgic follow-up Finding Nemo - disappointng."
" Beautiful film

",0.2382,0.9558,2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Let's face it, a sequel very seldom is as good as the original. Although the animation was equally great and the lovable characters are back, I did get a sense of deja vu here. It was pretty much an ""Oh, I've seen this before"" feeling. Although Dory, who was my favorite character in 'Finding Nemo', is now the main character, the plot seems all too familiar. It was nevertheless enjoyable, though."

Finding Dory in one word? Ok, how about FORGETTABLE. Yeah, I know one of the songs' name is Unforgettable...This movie sucked. It was drawn out, and way less sentimental than Finding Nemo.Finding Nemo showed the utter despair and depression that Marlin faced when Nemo was taken. Finding Dory covers that up by Dory having short-term memory loss. There's really no value in the movie, and relies on Dory's disorder for its humor."
" I forgot about how great Dory is

Ellen DeGenerous and Albert Brooks return to their iconic roles is once again amazing. However the writing isn't as amazing in the film (evident by the Truck scene) and the movie is extremely unessesary. I recall many asking for sequels to Toy Story, Incredibles, Cars But never a Nemo sequel, and this film sadly proves why. While fairly entertaining I personally wouldn't mind just rewatching the classic Finding Nemo again."
" Good for those of you who wanted more Dory and Marlin
",0.4404,0.932,2018-06-15 00:00:00,8,"I watched this in theaters and enjoyed it a lot. More of the clownfish family and their friend Dory. I wasn't bored in the slightest and I loved all of the different marine animals, especially the octopus and the beluga. There were edge-of-your-seat moments but it added more meat to the movie's bones. It's also kind of that quest for your past story where you have to find those special to you, even if you've only known them for a short while. Who hasn't had that experience or event in life? The movie may not be for everyone, but it's good for those of you who want more Nemo, Marlin, and Dory."
" Good but not as good as Finding Nemo
",-0.2867,0.9903,2018-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Amnesiac Blue Tang Dory takes centre stage in this sequel to Finding Nemo: Finding Dory might more accurately be called Finding Dory's Parents, although Dory finds herself, too.Dory's memory which, we know from Finding Nemo, is highly unreliable in the short term, conveniently returns sufficiently for her to recall her parents and, voila, we have our plot. Dory, accompanied by Marlin and Nemo, goes on a search which takes her to an extensive Sea Life Centre, where her trip from tank to tank, exhibit to exhibit, is helped enormously by a 7-tentacled octopus (heptopus?) who is talented at slithering from place to place.The story is fairly straightforward - far from dissimilar to Finding Nemo, in fact - but, rather than the heart of the story being the need to let go of your children (quite a deep concept for a kids' film), here it is friends, family and hope, a more accessible idea for a young audience.Dory is a likeable character as we already know, but is she strong enough to carry a whole film? My personal jury delivers a mixed verdict here. Baby Dory is simply wonderful, and Ellen DeGeneres does an exemplary job as the voice of adult Dory, but I found that a little of Dory's constant disquiet over her forgetfulness went a long way. And there was a lot of it, so it went a very long way. I understand that it was the central element to the plot, and that it was used to ratchet up the emotional stakes: I still found it tiresome.On the visual side, the often quite lovely visuals were matched with an awful lot of swimming about in dark, murky tunnels, pipes, weeds and depths - the film wasn't as dazzlingly eye-catching as Finding Nemo. Having said that, the finale was great, and the reveal of the multiple shell-trails caught me by surprise and choked me up.The 3D had little value.This is a worthwhile sequel with much to enjoy, but Finding Nemo is still the reigning champeen."

I liked it, but not as much as Finding Nemo because Dory didn't always remember she was lost or why which made her story less interesting and the ending climax seemed forced. It does have laughs and heart touching scenes, but Finding Nemo had more of both and stronger supporting characters. Oh, I saw Finding Dory today. I liked it, but not loved it. The original is still my favorite Pixar cartoon. That was a more exciting story...wait, what was I talking about?"

" Entertaining
",0.4404,0.9861,2018-05-12 00:00:00,7,"The animated sequel to ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) reverses the plight of the main characters: this time it is the memory-challenged bluefish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) rather than clownfish Nemo (Hayden Romence) who gets lost during a search to find her long-lost parents. Nemo and his father Marlin (Albert Brooks) try to find and rescue Dory with the aid of many other new characters. As this is an animated film, there are many antics, perils and troubleshooting that ensue.Like its prequel, this film has beautiful animation especially in the beginning as the camera follows the sea creature characters through long and fast journeys. The main characters and the array of new ones are quite funny and entertaining. The delightful DeGeneres is quite enjoyable throughout especially her high-energy flow of humour at the start. At times, she reminds one of the benchmark for animated performances: Robin Williams in ""Aladdin"" (1992).There are times ""Finding Dory"" is less than what it could be especially a pivotal scene in the second half. This scene began with the right emotional impact but then became too casual too soon. But by the end, the movie does what a Pixar/Disney cartoon is supposed to do: entertain. When the climactic scene is met with Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"", we know we are entering goosebump movie heaven. What a wonderful world, indeed."

In this one we really delve into her past and learn everything about her. She is such a likeable character, and I really feel like Pixar did it again with this one.

The storyline is just too ordinary. This was obviously made for the box office, the animation is good, but there is NO STORY here. It is well marketed hence it made this much money. It doesnt compare to classics like Kubo, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo. After this one watch, Im thinking of donating my DVD copy to a local library, it is not worth keeping or rewatching."

WTH??Oh and we can't forget the typical ""I hate this movie because they got the science wrong"" excuse.It's a kids movie FFS, not everything should be portrayed realistically, nor should it be taken seriously, seriously. That one review here about the movie offending orphans is an example of someone taking this movie way too seriously.Anyways, I actually never had the intention of watching this movie but I was bored so I gave it a shot, and it really exceeded my expectations. This movie is about grabbing onto every last bit of hope and aspiration and never letting go of it. This movie also emphasizes the moral importance of friends and family. At heart, this movie portrays all sorts of kindhearted and altruistic morals which I believe is what everyone needs every now and then, whether you're a kid or an adult.Also this is the second movie I have seen with Thomas Newman as the soundtrack composer. Newman definitely hit my feels in this movie and -- to be honest -- is probably the main reason why I liked this movie so much. His idiosyncratic style fills this movie with a truly unique and sentimental and almost idyllic feeling, something that I exactly wanted at the time of watching this movie.Overall 8/10."

The heavy reliance on flashbacks and homages to the first film really hampered this story, especially over a sluggish first act. There was definitely momentum, though, all the way to a (second) funny and fantastic finale. I laughed out loud throughout. Sequels rarely live up to their predecessors - and this film is no exception - but it did work, thanks in part to great performances and the usual Pixar creativity."
" Finding Money...
",0.0,0.9875,2017-12-22 00:00:00,6,"""Finding Nemo"" was such a self-sufficient and satisfying masterpiece it was beyond the predictability of needing a sequel. But once again know-it-all executives chose the easy way, milking the success of a beloved animated movie and making an ersatz of a sequel. 13 years after. It's all about the numbers, right? Well here's a number: 10. 10 reasons why the film sucked.1. Saccharine overdose, I expect many cutesy elements in a Disney Pixar movie, it first started with the babyish version of Dory, with those big eyes meant to make hearts melt and then she opened her mouth and I could have sworn the casting agents auditioned thousands of kids to find which one would have the cutest voice ever. Yes, she was adorable but it was like a doctor telling me to open my mouth and ""say aaaaaaaw"".2. The action starts too quickly, a random school trip on mister Ray's back, a random Dory's intrusion, and a random flashback and pop goes the Dory. ""Finding Dory"" was trying to create an emotional connection between the opening scene and the adult Dory but it felt just too rushed, it's not like we've seen Dory longing for her lost parents before, she just happens to remember she had parents. 3. You don't base the plots on comic reliefs, there was a reason why the short-term memory loss was used for Dory, it was a defining character's trait but also a running gag, here it structures the plot and makes it dependent on Dory's flashes of memories coming at the most conveniently possible time, just when she's in a false track or a dead end, there's something that pushes her on the road again. The first movie was following a simple trajectory, and was dependent on a few encounters and obstacles, here it's all about hazardous contrivances and twists of luck.4. The film is about Dory trying to find her parents, the title makes a little sense although it was the only possible one establishing a continuity with the first film. The problem is that the title basically establishes the story from Marlin and Nemo's perspective and they're secondary characters, in fact, they're as ""pivotal"" as Indiana Jones in ""Raiders"", we understand their presence but they're also here to show that the animators didn't believe Dory alone was capable to carry a whole movie. They were right, we needed the pairs of clown fishes as the straight ones, oh the irony!5. Too much repetition, of course it's inevitable if your main character is suffering from short-term memory loss but how many times did she needed to mention it, how many times did we need to see an excited and happy Dory just going all tail ahead. She was a lovable buffoon in the first, hysterical in a good way, now she's hysterical in the worst possible way. Everything that made the first film genuinely funny became rapidly annoying here and don't get me started on the whale speak.6. Caricatured characterization, try to say that quickly. It seems pretty obvious for Dory, but how about Marlin? Basically, he's learned nothing from the first film, and he's still acting like a paranoid over-protective sad sack, not only that, but he says perhaps the most terrible thing to Dory without immediately apologizing, following the idiot plot where anything can be solved if the right words are said.7. Too much time spent above the water,. I don't mind a fish going from an ocean to a tank, but this trip was a bit far-fetched even for a movie that features a fish that can read. The problem is that the first Nemo started with a shocker, but if the very rules of that sequel applied in the first film, the Barracuda or the dentist's fish tank wouldn't have caused much trouble. In a universe where a fish can talk to a sea-lion, travel on a crazy seagull, or when an octopus can easily vanish from sight like a chameleon, any thing is possible. These are not the rules ""Finding Nemo"" was based on.
Which leads me to that infamous car chase, Fonzie jumped the sharks, Dory jumped the truck... it's the same ruining effect. It's not enough that it's possibly the most overused climactic sequence in an action-packed movie, they had to indulge to it an a supposedly aquatic adventure. How about going for the emotional climax, how about actually making a good use of the aquatic park setting... how about not making the damn thing. 8. Indeed, was that trip necessary? Have we ever felt that there something in Dory's arc waiting to be closed. It is usual for animated sequels to focus on a character's background or on the secondary character, it worked with Buzz Lightyear for ""Toy Story 2"" but that's because there was good material in it. ""DreamWorks"" also came up with great secondary stories in the ""Shrek"" or ""Kung Fu Panda"" series, but Dory is just another-character-looking-for-her-parents with memory losses as a twist. It's a rather thin premise if you asked me. And you can tell they're trying to fatten it with the usual ""anything is possible"" lesson.9. What's with that musical schmaltz titled ""Unforgettable"" did they try to pull a ""Skyfall"" or what? The song was so James Bond-esque I expected to see a woman's silhouette swimming in the ocean. What a shameful Oscar-bait, the film didn't get any nominations and there's a good reason for that.10. It wasn't that funny, yeah, yeah, Sigourney Weaver was funny the first time and then got overused, in the French version, they even dubbed it with a famous anchorwoman, which didn't make sense, once again the star system is killing the film... I guess every country will have a famous national voice. the first film was about ""Finding Nemo"", the second has no reason to exist, except for ""Finding Money""."

I don't do a lot of reviews, but i thought this film didn't deserve that much trashtalk. If you liked finding Nemo and didn't anticipate for a sequel, and you just take it with a light heart, you'll enjoy this one a lot. Don't listen to the negative reviews here.

Dory who is played by Ellen DeGeneres plays a fish who suffers short term memory loss. She decides to go on a voyage to find her parents when she realizes that her parents are gone and she doesn't know where they went. Meanwhile Marlin and Nemo are trying to find Dory because she left without notice. Dory ends up in a marine life institute in California where she was from. There she meets old friends that help her remember where she came from, this in turn helps her to find her parents. The film could've been a bit more original and seemed like a cookie cutter of Finding Nemo at times in the movie. Even taking into account that the movie wasn't the most original thing in existence. The target audience of Finding Dory were the people, who are now adults and some possibly have children of their own, that saw Finding Nemo as kids. For the target audience the movie did exactly what it was supposed to do, reliving the joy they had when seeing Finding Dory. Overall it was a very good movie with an easy to follow plot and a nostalgic feeling. Thus we scored Finding Dory as 9/10 and a must see, instant classic."

There Dory meets Hank the Octopus who is a master of camouflage and reluctantly decides to help Dory in her quest because he is getting out of the aquarium and is only doing it for his own benefit. It is clear to see how much the CGI animation has improved since Finding Nemo. Throughout the film we get constant flashbacks to Dory and her past.

" Hollywood really needs to find unknown voices
",0.0,0.9415,2017-08-05 00:00:00,4,"Pixar is amazing. First of all.Secondly, the cute babyish face of the little Dory to go with the cuddly equally voice of the baby Dory was just way too a(dory)ble.And then Pixar went God mode into flashbacks of fast cuts of memories of Dory.But then they frikkin lost it.Ellen DeGeneres has a way distinctive voice. Admittedly I am not the slightest fan of this person, but the thing is I want to go and watch movie to suspend disbelief. Not be frikkin reminded of man- girl Ellen every time I see a babyish animation. Why the **** does Hollywood think it is okay just because you are an A-list celebrity you deserve to be anchored into a feature voices in cartoons and animations?Same with Eddie Murphy's voice in Shrek. *Cue haters saying I am homophobic and racist*That's not the point at all. Hollywood is just playing favorites by cherrypicking the people they like automatically thinking since they made it big in one department they will automatically be stellar in other department.Pixar. Disney. Your job is to create. Read my opening paras about the positivity. Stick to that. Stick to creating art, instead of prostituting your soul to the devil.Thank you."
" Dull - contrived - Cringe-worthy
",-0.4019,-0.4854,2017-08-05 00:00:00,1,"The animation is fine - as is expected of modern films.As stories go it is the worst cartoon I've seen - only lifted by the great scenes containing Hank the Octopus, but they are not enough to make a movie.Nothing to match it's predecessor: Contrived, dull, cringe-worthy."
" It's cute fluff - Nothing more; nothing less
",0.4588,0.9992,2017-08-05 00:00:00,6,"'FINDING DORY' was directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane and stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Ed O'Neil. ​Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) is a wide-eyed, blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss every 10 seconds or so. The one thing she can remember is that she somehow became separated from her parents as a child. With help from her friends Nemo and Marlin, Dory embarks on an epic adventure to find them. Her journey brings her to the Marine Life Institute, a conservatory that houses diverse ocean species. Dory now knows that her family reunion will only happen if she can save mom and dad from captivity.This movie will satisfy children and adults alike for its run time. If you hunger for something more than basic satisfaction from an animated feature, however, I cannot say I recommend it. Good voice acting, stunning animation and lovable characters are all things that this movie succeeds at while the humour and emotional payoff both lack substantially.One thing I will award credit for, however, is that they don't completely copy the plot of 'Finding Nemo' and actually attempt to change things up. That said, I didn't find the plot for this film that interesting or exciting. An instant thing I noticed that differs from 'Finding Nemo' to 'Finding Dory' is the claustrophobia of it. In the original, we had a wide, amazing ocean to explore and meet colourful characters. In here we meet colourful characters but the enclosed space we're limited to negates from the sense of wonder and amazement found in the original.Something that they improved in this movie, for me, was the climax. I hated the original's climax so I am glad they opted for a more inventive and interesting(to say the least) conclusion.Ellen DeGeneres was, of course, great as the titular character 'Dory' and continues her hot streak of playing the character to perfection. Part of the fun with Dory's character when she was introduced was her short term memory loss. That is what made her an inventive and unique character. That is why it was frustrating for me that they turned a key CHARACTER trait of hers into a nothing more than a meaningless plot device that only happened whenever the plot demanded it. I am not an avid supporter of the majority of changes between the two movies but this one takes the cake for me, as far as how unnecessary and annoying it was.Albert Brooks reprises his under-appreciated role as Marlin and still delivers a strong performance to a character that didn't need to be in the movie. Other than to bloat the film's run time with a Marlin/Nemo(who they recast by the way and I guarantee you did not notice) subplot that feels unnecessary and like just a way to pad run time. Pixar - you are above run time bloating!Ed O'Neil debuts the character of Hank and does a great job at it. I loved the character of Hanks and, to be honest, if this movie existed just to set up 'Finding Hank', I would be totally on board for that. Katie Olson also debuts another character, in the form of a blind whale called 'Destiny'. The performance is perfectly passable but the character is so weak and dull. Pixar try to catch lightning in a bottle twice by giving Destiny a 'craaaazy quirk' in the hilarious form of blindness. She isn't totally blind but she's pretty darn close and they use this to get a couple of laughs but it just doesn't work, at least for me.Animation for this movie is stunning and Pixar continues its noble tradition of making other studios step up their game. One thing I find quite funny, however, is that the water effects in this movie, a movie about FISH and WATER, has lower quality effects than that of 'The Good Dinosaur', a film about dinosaurs. Not to say that negates the wonderful animation put to use in this film, I just thought it was kind of funny. The cinematography is great, as is the editing and lighting.I will say that I laughed around 4-5 times in this movie, which is really not a good batting average. Obviously children will be crying on the floor with laughter(If your kids do then may God bless your soul) but I just don't find it that funny. They run jokes into the ground and fail to create any new ones. I may very well be the only one alive who doesn't think this film is 'funny, poignant and thought provoking' but I must express my opinion with complete honest. I didn't laugh at this movie as much as I wanted to.Pixar's strong suit is milking pathetic humans for their tears and films like 'Toy Story 2' and 'Up' show an inane ability to make me well up with tears from just a single scene. I didn't care about the characters in this movie. I wasn't invested and I didn't feel an emotional connection to any one particular character in this movie. The emotional payoff is not strong with this one.Personally, I think this movie would work so much better as a 15 minute short accompanying a special edition of 'Finding Nemo'. Cut the filler fluff and redundant side plots and create a nice, compact story about Dory finding her parents in the OCEAN. Obviously they did not go down this road and thus I must judge the movie on its other merits. I recommend this movie for children but not really for more mature audiences because I doubt you'll find a connection to any character or really find much of the film's content funny. I'll rate the movie 6 Pointless Sequels out of 10."

In reality, it's 97minutes of my life that I'm never going to get back. The movies starts off with a little recap of what happened so far, so even if you haven't seen Nemo, you'll still understand. Sadly I think those might be the only people who might actually like this movie. For me it looked like ""Here's everything we did in Finding Nemo, we just put Dory where Nemo used to be"" change a few locations, and we're done. sadly that's not the end of it, The same joke over and over. After 10 times it just isn't funny anymore. This movie is predictable and at moments downright boring. I expected more. If you haven't seen it, don't. Just put on Finding Nemo and save yourself a lot of frustration. I rated this movie 3* because of how good the original was. the movie itself is 1*, and that's kind. Right now I wish I was Dory, then I would forget this in about 90 seconds.... Sadly, I have to live with the memory of a movie that is substandard."
" Nothing soulless about this one
",0.0,0.9707,2017-07-07 00:00:00,7,"Because of the studio's recent emphasis on sequels (prequels, what-have-you), I'm in the habit of selling PIXAR movies short. And ""Finding Dory"" was no exception; my expectations were admittedly low. But the filmmakers quickly reminded me of why I liked ""Nemo"" so much, and I was on board from there.It's a lively adventure movie, briskly paced and boasting worthy additions to the cast. It maintains the gorgeous ocean visuals of the original and there's something genuinely heartfelt about the story. A classic family theme is sufficient, but the real message is extremely touching and appropriately subtle: teaching kids how to live with a disability.There was just no disliking this movie.7/10"
" Excellent for kids
",0.5719,0.9866,2017-06-29 00:00:00,8,"Finding Dory had the potential to be annoying, and for a certain amount of time, it feels almost laborious due to Dory's memory loss being played for effect numerous times before her long term memory kicks into gear. Once it does, the movie takes off. Dory pulls Marlin and Nemo along with her to meet another batch of interesting and funny sea creatures, as she learns where she came from, how she got lost, and where her parents got off to. It's a terrific kids movie, and has enough emotional depth to stay interesting for the adults, especially those who were kids when Finding Nemo was out in 2003, and felt the fear and apprehension of Marlin as he and Dory hunted for his lost son.There will probably not be another one of these movies, but that's fine. The story is superb, the characters are diverse and fun, and there's plenty of bright colors and beautiful visuals to go around. It's heart is, undeniably, in the right place, with new, amazing side characters that has become expected from Pixar. It just never achieves the highest emotional impact on me, like I felt many previous Pixar films have had. Pixar is great at making animated movies that have more to them than just simple kids stuff, and they've proved that over and over. It's no accident that this movie is the highest grossing animated film of all time. ---From Yidioo"
" I laughed, I misted u
",0.4588,0.9791,2017-06-20 00:00:00,10,"Back to the pond for Pixar, where we find things largely unchanged from the end of 2003's Finding Nemo. As the continually-forgetful blue tang Dory has a sudden enduring flash of her childhood, a rush of recall, she gathers the clownfish for one more globe-spanning adventure. The setup is a little soft, lingering too long in the shadow of the first film, but eventually we break free of that sentiment and forge a new (if similar) identity for the sequel. The closed-in landscape of an aquatic themed zoo/amusement park feels a bit claustrophobic at first glance, but as hijinx ensue and we learn more of Dory's early years, it all fleshes out nicely. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist ""septipus"" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. O'Neill brings his usual disgruntled pessimism to the role, though, and some genuinely clever sight gags using the creature's natural assets go a long way to smoothing that over. He's overly convenient, but we're always glad to see him again. Witty and fast-paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. I laughed, I misted up, but I never quite fooled myself into thinking it was superior to the first."

And you don't even have to be Dory, I mean forgetful, for this to work for you. Yes it does make sense to watch the first one (Finding Nemo) then, although I reckon you could watch it and enjoy it as a standalone too.The characters and their traits are strong and there are a lot of side jokes built in to this too. Humans are being treated like extras and we wouldn't have the time to deal with them anyway. That is apart from one major voice - but it's being highlighted too as if one of the writers or Ellen herself might have a crush there. But you can't blame them for that. On the contrary you can congratulate everyone involved for a really good movie"

I really didn't think there was anything else that could be done with that story. WRONG! It was honestly a million times better than I ever could have expected. I definitely loved it more than the original Finding Nemo. Dory was a fan favorite in the original film and the sequel delivers more of Ellen's whimsical portrayal of the forgetful little fish.I am a sucker for backstory (main reason I love the Star Wars prequels) and I absolutely loved the direction they took this film in. Fun for the whole family. Laughs, lessons, tons of heart. Who could ask for more? The voice acting cast was tremendous, particularly Ellen, of course. They really know how to pull you into this undersea world. I really wouldn't have changed anything about it. A truly delightful movie."

I could relate so much to Dory, I'm always forgetting things, I'm always lost and I cried so many times in this movie because I could relate. She is just like me and when other fishes got mad at her, I felt the same way she did. It was a very deep and emotional movie, I absolutely loved it (even though I don't remember everything). If you are constantly lost in your own world and have a fish memory, I guarantee that you will cry watching the movie."
" Charming, funny with a great message
",0.8957,0.9995,2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,"Finding Dory is not only a gorgeous-looking animated film, but a really family fun adventure. It's cheeky, funny, cute, naughty, crazy and heart-warming. It is not specially simple or over the top, and settles in a happy medium that will please kids and a adults alike. Although this is a sequel to Finding Nemo, the story feels like a film on its own, and while some of the events and characters in the first film appear also here, Finding Dory would still be a great film even if the first movie had never been made.Finding Dory is not a film about being lost, is a film a about finding who you are and finding home. It sends a message that your family is not always just your natural family, but those who include you in their family, help and love you when you don't have anybody else and you are most vulnerable.The story also sends a very positive message to any kid who has a disability, learning problem, or is just different. Dory has a short memory span, yet that problem makes her take decisions rapidly and be fearless and resolute, lets her evaluate any situation rapidly and make the best of it; Dory needs of other people, but she is so devoted and caring, that anybody wants to help her when she's in need. The analogy for those kids who are different is wonderful -- those things that seem to be a shortcoming and make you different, might end being the source of your greatness, helping you develop great qualities, and make of you an unique lovable individual. No animated movie can pass the adults' test without having great characters and great voices. This is the case here. The characters are varied, funny, have distinct personalities, and the actors lending their voices to them do a great job at infusing them with life and soul. I enjoyed Ellen being Dory. She did a great job at infusing Dory with that charm and soul the character needs. Besides, Ellen's natural voice has those things that are quintessential Dory: naughtiness, innocence, excitement and child-like tones. I found baby Dory absolutely adorable and wonderful. Once Dory becomes an adult and Ellen's voice is more fully there, I couldn't but hear Ellen, not always Dory. I would have liked her voice to be a bit more twinkled or morphed so as to allow Dory to take Ellen over, if you know what I mean.My main criticism to the film is perhaps the fact that the story becomes inorganic when we see an octopus driving a van and a fish reading signs and driving signs. Not that I didn't enjoy it, but I thought that somewhat didn't glue well with the rest of the film.The film comes together with the short film Pipper, which I reviewed elsewhere, and adorable addition to a great combo.Most enjoyable."

",-0.2263,-0.3884,2017-05-07 00:00:00,4,"I'm not going to say that this movie was just a total waste of time...but about 85% of the film was. Coming from me, a person who is extremely passionate about science and biology wouldn't appreciate the constant factual errors in the film. Dory and other fish friends of hers could never tolerate the constant changing in water quality from hopping from tank to tank. Whale sharks are not whales, either. One thing that got to be a bit annoying was the tank jumping, because that's almost all that we see. Every couple of moments, either Dory or Marlin and Nemo are hopping from tank to tank at the aquarium, or flying in a bucket of water carried by sea foul. It's a constant aspect. Not to mention we have an octopus who can breathe for an undetermined amount of time. Also, forgive me but, how did no one notice an unattended baby stroller with tentacles flailing about from it, and no nearby adults? I understand most of the American population is rather dunce, but jeez, give commoners some kind of credit.Anyways, it was a sweet story and heartwarming ending, but the movie was mostly repetitive nonsense and persistence. Not my walk in the park."

" A forgetful fish searches for her family
",-0.2732,0.997,2017-05-05 00:00:00,9,"Those who have seen 'Finding Nemo' will remember Dory the Blue Tang with short term memory problems but just in case you haven't watched it or have forgotten, the opening of 'Finding Dory' shows us Dory as a child with her parents; she gets separated from them and starts asking other fish for help but as she can't remember where they were or what they are called she doesn't find them. Eventually she forgets all about them and her search. She then bumps into Marlin, a scene that features near the start of 'Finding Nemo' as well.A year passes and suddenly Dory realises that she must have a family and determines to find then. Various things lead to her remember that she was from 'The Jewel of Morro Bay across the ocean in California'. With the help of the sea turtles she, along with Marlin and Nemo head to California. Dory gets tangled in some plastic and pulled from the water by a worker from the local Marine Life Institute. Here she meets Hank the octopus who offers to help her find her parents; she also gets help from a short-sighted whale shark who knew Dory when she was little and a beluga whale who thinks his sonar is broken. While Dory is looking for her parents Marlin and Nemo are trying to find Dory with the help of a pair of sea lions, a slightly batty loon and some cute sea otters.In many ways this film is a rerun of the first with fish looking for each other across the width of the Pacific thankfully they are plenty of differences too. Dory makes a charming lead; it is certainly interesting to have a lead character with a mental health issue as protagonist in something that isn't an 'issue film', especially one aimed at younger viewers. Dory's memory issues are dealt with in a way that manages to show that she copes in her own ways and isn't overly played for laughs. The new characters are pretty good; I particularly liked Hank the grumpy octopus and Destiny the myopic whale shark. There are plenty of child-friendly perilous moments and some good laughs as well as one or two melancholy moments; these don't last long enough to make things depressing though. As one would expect from a Pixar film the animation is of a very high quality and the voice cast do a great job; especially Ellen DeGeneres who brings a real emotional depth to the role of Dory. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Pixar, especially those who enjoyed 'Finding Nemo'."
" Finding Dory and the Value of Being ""Different""
",0.34,0.9979,2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"As a parent of two small children and big fan of pretty much all things Pixar (""The Good Dinosaur"" being the notable exception), I was anticipating this film as much as almost any I have experienced. For the most part I really enjoyed this movie, though there were certainly points where it fell short, almost all of which had to do with the plot.SPOILERS BELOW: Plot = Overly complicated - With a movie title like ""Finding Dory"" it is no surprise that conceptually the plot borrows heavily from the original. The impetus of Dory's initial journey is to find her family in much the same way Marlin leaves the reef in search of Nemo. While the background behind the ""lost family member(s)"" is different, the motif is the same... of course, if that were the end of the body of narrative the movie would have been called ""Finding Jenny and Charlie,"" so there is a shift where Dory, who is in search of her parents, becomes herself ""lost"" (though she is not entirely aware of that) and must be ""found"" by Marlin and Nemo. In the process of all this ""finding"" more plot twists ensue with ultimately a truck-driving octopus (septopus) launching himself and a box-truck full of sea life into the air and diving into Morro Bay... It's a more than a bit over-the-top even by cartoon standards. For me that's where the shortcomings end...Characters=Delightful - Where this film shines is in the characters... With the exception of Marlin and (to a lesser extent) Nemo (though I think their lack of likability helped move the story along), all the characters were likable and compelling. Ed O'Neill as Hank was a welcome foil to Ellen DeGeneres' optimistic Dory, and their back-and-forth dialogue rounded out Dory's character in a nice way.With all its delightful characters and stunning artistry what stands out is that this is an important movie for all people because it reminds us of the value of every single person regardless of their perceived brokenness. Character after character in this film deals with some physical or mental challenge: Becky, Destiny, Hank the Septopus (!), Gerald, Bailey (though his is more a challenge of accepting his wellness), and the host of other ill sea creatures that are at the marine life institute to get well. All these characters work to greater or lesser degrees to the ultimate end of the narrative (as convoluted as it is). And of course, the central figure of the film Dory is notorious because she suffers from ""short- term remembery loss"". It is this challenge that caused her to lose her way, but it is also this challenge that helps her maintain an (almost) endless optimism. (As a side note, the opening sequence of Dory's parents trying to help her find her way around their home was both endlessly touching and heartbreaking). In fact, it is not until Marlin and Nemo (the least likable of the central characters) begin to thoughtfully ask the question, ""What would Dory do?"" That they begin to have any real impact.As a pastor, I am constantly trying to remind people they are made in the image and likeness of God... that there is a significant divine imprint on everyone. As a pastor who advocates for families and children with special needs in the faith community, I see how important this ideal is to reiterate amid the challenges these families face. As a person who has many many friends with children with autism, Down syndrome, and the like, I am encouraged by their stories of realization and gratitude. ""Finding Dory"" demonstrates that what may seem like a brokenness in a person is but an opportunity to see life from a different and fresh perspective that, while not without its difficulties, is rewarding."
" Forget me not

There Dory meets Hank the Octopus who is a master of camouflage and reluctantly decides to help Dory in her quest.It is clear to see how much the CGI animation has improved since Finding Nemo, but this sequel is less charming and also has less originality. Too many scenes are contrived so you see familiar faces or have Dory getting flashbacks with her parents. The finale with a truck chase sequence is just far fetched.My kids enjoyed the movie and found parts of it emotional as well. Interest in clown-fish will still be around for a few more years."
" Sweet, fun movie

Through the help of a diverse bunch of friends, including a 7-tentacled octopus named Hank, she sets off to find them.Sweet, fun movie, made as a sequel (or prequel) to Finding Nemo. Has many of the same qualities as Finding Nemo - good family fun, some great comedic moments and wonderful animation - incredibly vivid colours and seamless movement. Once again, the voice casting is spot- on and goes a long way to making the movie as good as it is.Not quite as good as Finding Nemo though. The sentimentality in Finding Dory was laid on a bit thick and feels empty and manipulative at times. Finding Nemo felt more subtle and genuine in that regard."
" Just as good as the first one
",0.4404,0.9964,2017-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Pixar has this habit of telling the exact same story with their sequels, yet doing it in such a way that it doesn't bother us. This is a usual sequel problem where the story is the exact same and nothing has changed. And perhaps that's the trick. Because things do change in Pixar movies, yet the characters end up in the same kind of situations despite having grown as people.Take Finding Dory, for instance. The characters we know and love have evolved. Marlin has relaxed a little bit due to the events of the first film, Nemo has matured and Dory has finally found an anchor point for herself. Yet, as you might surmise from the title, Dory ends up lost and this time it's up to Marlin and Nemo to look for her.And it works. It really works. In my mind this is very much on par with the original film. If I was forced to choose, I'd pick the original, but that's solely to the novelty of it, and in this case that counts only as a tiebreaker. The animation quality is still superb, the returning characters feel the same, the story is just as exciting as before, the ocean is still a great place to have an adventure, the new characters are all interesting and it just feels familiar.Is it among my favourite Pixar films? Not really, but that's like saying that you prefer chocolate ice cream over strawberry one. Both are amazing, but the one is just more to your liking. I honestly do think that both this and Finding Nemo don't necessarily need the big action endings they both have, and I'm not a huge fan of Marlin nor Nemo. This film has a bigger action ending, but on the other hand Dory's emotional struggle with her memory loss is some of the best drama Pixar has ever done, so it evens out. And even this is me really nitpicking.It's a good film from Pixar. Definitely worth a shot if you liked the original."

While I wanted to lose some sleep over ""The Conjuring 2,"" the rest of my friends had their sights set on the newest Pixar flick.Bitterly inhaling my package of raspberry sour straws, I slumped into my seat and made a valiant attempt to dislike this movie. However, much like with last year's ""Inside Out,"" Pixar won me over yet again with ""Finding Dory.""Ellen DeGeneres reprises her role from ""Finding Nemo"" as Dory: a kind, easygoing blue tang fish who suffers from short-term memory loss. All is well under the sea until Dory randomly experiences a flashback from her childhood of her and her parents. Remembering that she was separated from her family long ago, Dory races off to find her parents, relying only on her poor memory to guide her.While this film is not a retread of ""Finding Nemo,"" it provides a few nods to the original, and many of the characters from ""Nemo"" return in supporting roles or cameos. The film also implements the voice talents of Idris Elba, Ty Burrell and Sloane Murray, who plays an adorable baby Dory in the flashbacks.The most interesting character addition, however, is that of Hank, played by Ed O'Neill. The irritable, pessimistic, yet kind-hearted octopus warms up to the spastic, forgetful nature of Dory, and their interplay throughout elevates the film's drama and humor.Is it as good as ""Finding Nemo?"" Perhaps, but much like ""Monster's University"" in 2013, ""Finding Dory"" differs in many ways from its predecessor and compliments it well. With sequels like ""Cars 3,"" (2017) ""Toy Story 4"" (2018) and the highly anticipated ""The Incredibles 2"" (2019) on the horizon, I am eager to see where Pixar takes our imaginations next."
" A fun and heartwarming romp in the sea
",0.7506,0.9444,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"While, to me, Finding Dory was not as good as Finding Nemo - and rarely, in my opinion, do sequels hold a candle to their predecessors - I still found this movie to be thoroughly enjoyable and heartfelt; an entertaining addition to the Disney lineup. With the mere mention of Dory's family in the first film comes the concluding chapter into who Dory really is. The film includes some new and hysterical characters who each provide their own charm and humor and, of course, Dory is as gleefully clueless as she was in the first film. The new environments and scenarios she finds herself in are all beautifully animated and baby Dory is to die for.The only critique I have would be Marlin and Nemo's inclusion in Dory's quest to find her family. Their presence, while supportive, seemed at times to be more distracting, taking away from Dory as the main focus of the story. Marlin is obviously more approving of Nemo's independence and open to crazy ideas, so there's not much more growth to his, or Nemo's, character. Overall, however, I found the movie to be greatly entertaining and a joy to watch. I'd recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the first."
" The best Pixar sequel since Toy Story 3.
",0.6369,0.9988,2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"After ""Toy Story 3"" was released back in 2010, Pixar has started to put out more and more follow ups to their previous critically acclaimed films this decade. I loved the aforementioned ""Toy Story 3"", loathed ""Cars 2"" and thought ""Monsters University"" was pretty good, but not as great as the first film. So, I really didn't know what to expect with ""Finding Dory"", the sequel to one of my favorite animated movies ""Finding Nemo."" I was nervous thinking it was just going to be a film that was going to be on par with Pixar's previous film ""The Good Dinosaur"", but at the same time I was excited hoping it would be as fun and clever as ""Inside Out"". And luckily enough, it was another winning movie from Pixar. ""Finding Dory"" is a great sequel that keeps up the excitement, makes you guess where the film is going to go, and is just straight up fun and funny.One year has passed from the previous film, and out favorite short-term memory loss fish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), finally remembers something, her family. With the location being at ""the Jewel of Morro Bay, California"", she set outs with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (now played by Hayden Rolence) to go find her parents. When they arrive off the coast in California, Dory is captured by marine biologists and taken to a marine life institute. While she's in quarantine, she meets a very grumpy octopus, no wait a minute, septapus as he has lost a tentacle, named Hank (Ed O'Neill). She asks him to help her find her family in the institute in exchange for a tag the biologists have placed on her which would take her to an aquarium in Cleveland. Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo are trying to figure out how to get inside the institute to find Dory through any crazy means possible.The best part of ""Finding Dory"", like most Pixar movies is the story. It's crazy fun. It's exciting, funny, emotional, suspenseful, and keeps you guessing the whole way through which is what I really expect for a movie. The animation is also a great part of the film. Just like the first movie, it's beautiful. The colors are eye popping, the underwater world is mysterious, and the institute looks like a very nice place to visit. The characters once again are to many to count. Ellen DeGeneres is great as usual, Albert Brooks is pretty great, and I especially love Ed O'Neill as Hank. This octopus can blend into almost everything, which leads to some real funny comedy. Oh yeah, speaking of the comedy, this movie is hilarious. I think I was bawling my eyes out from laughing hard at this movie and I nearly got hiccups laughing too hard. The emotion is also where it needs to be. Some scenes in this movie can be tear jerker. Even though I didn't cry watching movies, I was very close to doing so watching this film.Personally, ""Finding Dory"" is the best Pixar sequel since ""Toy Story 3"". No doubt in my mind. It could be as good if not even better than ""Finding Nemo"". I am dead serious. I really love this film. It's great. I can probably go on forever praising this movie, but I probably shouldn't. All I can say is go check it out. Trust me. It really is worth your time."
" Another example of Pixar's dwindling efforts
",0.0,0.9982,2017-03-21 00:00:00,4,"If we look back just a few years ago, Pixar really still was the company that seemed to be able to do no wrong but in these last few years for whatever reason the Pixar brand has taken a little bit of a hit.Sure there's still the great original films like Inside Out but there's also been miscued films like Brave, Monster's University, the tiresome Good Dinosaur and now the long talked about and hyped Finding Dory.2003's Finding Nemo is a film fondly remembered by many, I know I for one still very much remember witnessing the film for the first time at the cinema and enjoy every minute of it, but taking a character that was fine as a support to the films leads and turning them into the figurehead of this return to the sea really brings down the chances Finding Dory had of being much more than a pretty animated adventure that leaves nothing of a lasting impression.The forgetful fish Dory, once more voiced here by comedian Ellen DeGeneres, on a journey to find her parents that she's somehow remembered doesn't make for much of an engaging tale even with her quest taking her all the way to a sea life park where she meets colourful characters like Hank the octopus (stealing most of the films best scenes), Destiny the whale shark or Bailey the beluga whale.Finding Nemo won audiences over with its great voice acting, memorable characters and simple yet effective central idea, Finding Dory feels tired as it tries to pay its respect's to the original whilst paving its own path out through the open storytelling waters but as has sadly become the case with Pixar's reliance now of bringing back past properties, this feels like a cash grab rather than a genuine attempt to create something fresh to wow audiences of all ages with. It's a problem the animation power house never use to have but with expectations come great pressure's Pixar currently aren't living up to.Finding Dory looks great (as do all Pixar films) and there are some inventive scenarios at play here but this sequel which has taken too long to come to surface fails to live up to the name we've come to expect from its classic forefather and with an annoying forgetful fish as our main point of contact, Finding Dory is more arduous for adults than we'd have liked and is one for the kiddies only.2 learning on the job truck drivers out of 5"
" Finding Dory Review
",0.0,0.8932,2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"Finding Dory is a animated children's movie and is the sequel in the series, the first being Finding Nemo. It was released on 17th of June 2017 and was directed and written by Andrew Stanton and was made in Pixar Animation Studios California. This film featured iconic stars like Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Ed O'Neill. Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) gets lost from her home and gets taken into the ocean at a very young age. She finds the family of Marlin and Nemo who aid her in finding her way back to her parents. The story is set in the great barrier reef in Australia. The tone in this movie is emotional because the film starts out with dory losing her parents. Later in the movie you feel the anticipation to whether or not Dory finds her parents. Overall I would recommend it to any parents to watch with their kids or anyone who likes the film Finding Nemo. This film was very good in my opinion and that is why I give it a 8/10."

But as most of the reviewers pointed out, the plot is somehow too unreasonable to the extent that it exceeds the category of animation. I feel ""Finding Nemo"" goes more smoothly, and the jokes there are more interesting.But still, if you are a fan of Pixar, I would recommend this film to you. This is an acceptable movie from them but not excelling."
" A sequel with purpose an flair
",0.0,0.9869,2017-03-14 00:00:00,9,"For its grandiose reputation as a creative mecca, even Pixar has been unable to resist the Faustian bargain of a sequel every now and then. While Ellen DeGeneres' popularity and ""Toy Story 3""""s Oscar nomination made a sequel inevitable, it shouldn't be discounted that Dory (DeGeneres) was deservedly a breakout character in her own right when she debuted thirteen years ago as Marlon's (Albert Brooks) memory-addled sidekick. The circuitous dialogue resulting from Dory's short-term memory loss makes for the kind of back-and- forth of an updated Abbott and Costello routine. Similarly, Dory's chipper attitude in the face of her (presupposed) inability to accomplish anything outside a 30-second window makes her a spunky can-do everyman.The challenge coming into ""Finding Dory"" is similar to nearly every TV spin-off from Gomer Pyle to Joey: Can the comic relief carry their own storyline? In this case, yes: It turns out there's a lot of depth to Dory when you factor in the potential that her memory could resurface and, indeed, that's the route we go down.Dory begins to experience flashbacks that take her, Nemo, and a reluctant Marlon (taking each other for granted is a theme here) all the way to a Seaworld-like aquarium in California where Dory, Nemo, and Marlin find themselves in and out of various rooms and fish tanks. Lack of opposable limbs or bodies larger than three inches be damned, this is the Pixar universe and pesky human contraptions like doors are no match for you if you have determination and some crafty friends to help. These include a beluga whale (Ty Burrell) with echolocation, a near-sighted whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and a curmudgeon of an octopus whose congruence with voice actor Ed O'Neill's screen persona makes him the film's breakout character. If you're someone with a deep-seated love for aquariums and Jacques Cousteau like me, there's an enchantment in the animation that you would never get from the renderings of toys, ants, superheroes, or dystopian garbage piles that Pixar has previously done. There's also the added bonus of the biological accuracy and the clever ways in which these traits are ingrained in their characters. High-quality animated flicks typically come with moral parables and the original one here is the way that people with disabilities can contribute to society and are capable of surprise. Although Dory couldn't really navigate the freeways of California, it all feels surprisingly organic here."
" This beautiful Disney Picture takes us back to the world of Finding Nemo with an explanation of the forgetful yet widely loved Dory.
",0.7717,0.9927,2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"To start, Disney animation has improved immensely over the years- transforming from amazing to even better. The overall quality of film is outstanding. The picture is crisp and clear, giving an amazingly realistic view of the ocean. As always, every character, no matter how insignificant, is adorable and brilliantly thought out. The animators did an outstanding job.Next, the story brings you right back to Finding Nemo. We see the same side characters presented in a slightly older position. Additionally, this movie fills in some gaps of the characters that were left by Finding Nemo. For example, we discover the past of many characters and gain insight to the world that these films are set in. We also gain some new characters to provide comedy relief and slight conflict throughout the story.Overall, Finding Dory will be a hit for families and older adults alike. With hilariously endearing characters and a rich story, there is really nothing to not like. Everything down to each note of the soundtrack and every pixel on the screen is planned with amazing precision and skill. I would give Finding Dory a ten out of ten."
" Much too hectic
",0.0,0.9659,2017-03-11 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to give this movie a higher review, but unfortunately I couldn't allow myself to. However, with that said, before I get to the movie, I'd like to mention that if you're the type of person who expects a certain amount of plausibility and realism from a computer generated image movie, written for children in a blatant (and should be quite apparent) attempt to suspend reality for an hour and a half, this will not be your movie. And if you're that type of person, you probably find A LOT of movies disappointing. Finding Dory was an absurdly fast-paced movie, with too much emphasis on driving the plot forward, rather than letting it develop on its own. Dory was a wonderful supporting character in Finding Nemo, but in this movie we just weren't given enough of a reason to invest emotionally in her adventure. While Finding Nemo felt like a very organic and nuanced story, this movie feels incredibly contrived and tries to inflate its bland emotionless existence with over-the-top action sequences and clumsy joking around which only made me want to know when things were going to get interesting, only to discover that they never really do. While Finding Nemo relied a great deal on the ocean and played on different sea life and settings, this movie makes almost no attempt to involve the aquarium where the majority of the movie takes place - instead it forces the story to take place around it and in spite of it. But even as a stand alone movie, Finding Dory falls short of giving enough reason to want to see what happens next. Rather it relies on being the sequel to a wonderful movie and attempts to ride those coat tails while also trying to skimp on the storytelling. In all, a disappointment."

" Just keep swimming, just keep swimming...
",0.0,0.9952,2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Sequels are tough. Even though we live in a strange new age where sequels are already planned and penned seven chapters ahead of time, in movie form as to squash out all of the detail and description a television series could properly do, sequels are still tough. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS goes something like this: The first movie was slightly stale popcorn. The second was trying too hard to be funny. The third was about the same as the first, just in a different location. The fourth turned out to be a bit more interesting when they started playing with the timeline. The sixth was too serious, the seventh was too gritty. Overall, popcorn. Most of it stale, or at least past its prime.I skipped FAST FIVE on purpose, because of all of the FAST movies, it's easily the best. It takes the best of the slapstick that makes the movies bearable, mixes it with the best of jokes, and just overall has a blast with itself, never daring to take itself too seriously or try to bog us down in soap opera-style deaths while making yet another point about the importance of family (which is yet another reason why I think 8 will collapse, but more on that some other time).Making franchises, to me, is like having half a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread. Your task is to somehow spread what little peanut butter you've got over the length of the entire loaf. You can't use too much in any particular spot, so what you end up with is a thin layer of flavor over a stack of wheat slices, which by the time you're finished, leaves you wishing for anything other than peanut butter on bread, and may traumatize you from ever eating it again.That being said, there are, of course, flawed gemstones in the midst of the bread. A moment where you became frustrated, and said, ""screw this, I'm going to indulge myself!"" and slapped a little too much on that middle slice, just so you could get some joy out of it. Thereby jeopardizing the rest of the loaf, unfortunately.Sorry for the long intro.FINDING DORY is not a good sequel. Shticks that are put into movies that test our ability to suspend belief are best used sparingly, and this is not something anyone that made this movie really stopped to care about. In FINDING NEMO, most of the action was underwater, and when the fish needed to jump locations, it was done carefully, tip-toeing the edge of where believability would be lost.FINDING DORY simply doesn't care. The logic is to just throw caution to the wind and hope for the best. ""Just keep swimming, just keep swimming"" ends up becoming less of a mantra for the kindhearted Dory and more of a directive for the entire film, a kind of sweeping message designed to keep you in the game, so to speak, so you won't think too hard about the complete lack of logic presented here.Tearjerker moments involving Dory's youth take a lot away from the comedy of NEMO, where what could have been a very dark tale of desperation and despair was turned into a fun adventure, and sometimes we're left with that empty-hole feeling, that all-too painful reality of just how hard it would be for someone who truly lived with short term memory loss to live a happy life. I'm reminded of MEMENTO, and that's not something I should be thinking about when watching a film of this caliber. Pixar has always been good at touching the darker side of reality, but only with a light touch, and never one that doesn't have some resolution down the line. While we do have resolution here, it's not a complete payoff as is the case with other films of this kind, because Dory is still Dory, in the end. Will she even remember the journey she's taken, and the point of it all? Pixar's golden age has come to an end, and it's sad to see, from a guy who's found an awful lot to love about their films. I'm supposed to get excited about CARS 3, when I didn't really think CARS was on the same level as so many other Pixar gems, and then CARS 2 which turned out to be nothing more than a giant commercial for churning out Disney merchandise. Needless to say, I don't have any high expectations for Lightning McQueen's 3rd expo into Maynard jokes and inexplicable competition woes.TOY STORY 4 is coming. I haven't seen TOY STORY 3, but it's one of those films that you end up hearing about because of its overall impact, and there is a certain sense of finality about it that is something I truly appreciate in films. I've always thought, regarding movies, that three is the lucky number, the perfect pattern for a fictional reflection of life: It begins. It lives. It ends. It's how it should be.So I guess we're looking at FAST AND THE FURIOUS logic infecting everything. As long as we're making moolah, churn out those overpriced theater tickets. How many Toy Stories are waiting for us, just around the corner? How many slices of bread are we headed for, with just enough peanut butter gracing the ridges of the wheat as to tell our mouths what we are eating, without really being able to derive any pleasure from it, because of how much is lacking? Are we facing a time when, as in SOYLENT GREEN, Charlton Heston sucks what's left of the remains of jam off of a dirty spoon, just to tearfully remember a time when food was delicious Instead of just filling?"
" Disappointed
",-0.4767,0.5187,2017-02-25 00:00:00,4,"I thought Finding Dory was a letdown. After the first Nemo movie and Wall-E, only a masterpiece of the same magnitude would have satisfied. The story of this movie is that Dory, the beloved character from Finding Nemo, makes her way to an aquarium to find her parents. Most of the movie consists of her making her way through the facility trying to track down where she came from. There are a lot of scenes of her being carried in a pail, swimming through pipes, and moving through nice looking scenery. I just wasn't moved by any of it. When the movie arrives at its climax, I felt no emotional payoff. There was also an action sequence near the end that drained any interest I had of not only finishing the movie, but of visiting these characters again. This movie was just a series of empty obstacles with no reason for viewers to care."
" There's something in the water at Pixar!
",0.0,0.9985,2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"There must be something in the water at Pixar! After their 2003 triumph Finding Nemo, Pixar continued the famous aquatic trios' adventure in the sequel, Finding Dory. Pixar uses their ability to create realistic animation mixed with the voices of many famous actors to hold their spot at the top of the cartoon universe. In this similar but different sequel, Nemo's heroine Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a fun, lovable, but often forgetful fish has an adventure of her own. Dory suffers from short-term memory loss, but she starts to have short flashbacks of where she came from. As she ventures to find her family, Dory is joined by Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo (Hayden Rolence) and Pixar's newest eight-legged hero, an octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neil) who helps her in many tight spots along the journey. She is also reunited and helped by some of her old childhood friends along the way. As far as sequels go, the plot to Finding Dory is far too similar to Finding Nemo. Pixar follows almost the exact plot line, except for parents looking for their child, it is a child looking for their parents. There is no creativity in the plot set up for this movie, however the similarity is not a disappointment. It allows for Pixar to up the ante when it comes to the new animation technology, the script, and the actors, and they did just that. With the advancement in technology, and the ability to create animation increases in movies, adds to the wonder of this movie. Compared to the 2003 movie Finding Nemo, this film has many more intricate details regarding the animation. The primary background of the ocean water flows extremely fluidly. Also, way the fish maneuver throughout the water is remarkably life-like, one might think they are swimming with the fish. Not to mention the ray of colors within this film are as vibrant as ever. Pixar deserves an A+ with this one! Besides the amazing animation, the cast line up for this movie is also absolutely incredible. Day time talk show host and comedian, Ellen DeGeneres is flawless as Dory, while the hilarious Ed O'Neal and Ty Burrell (stars of ABC's Modern Family) are along with her throughout the adventure. Not to mention countless of other familiar voices such as: Kaitlin Olson, Albert Brooks, and Diane Keaton, help add to the light heartedness of the movie. The cast chosen for this movie are high quality actors as they add many raw emotions throughout movie, giving it the ability to appeal to the emotions of people of all ages. If you are looking for a movie to watch alone, with friends, or even with family you can't go wrong with Finding Dory. If you missed the showings while it was in theaters do not worry as it is now out on DVD, and as of February 2017 it is up on Netflix making it accessible for everyone to watch and enjoy the ""tale"" of the fun, lovable, but forgetful fish, Dory."

",0.0,0.9982,2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"The well-known character from Disney's Finding Nemo has now finally gotten her own spotlight. Dory, the funniest fish in the ocean thanks to her voice actress Ellen DeGeneres, is able to take on another adventure. The movie also features all the other past characters that everyone fell in love with from the start. This film is amazing because of how well the voice actors portray the characters, the emotions it brings to the audience, and its animation.The voice actors in Finding Dory do more than an excellent job with making the animated characters come alive. The hilarious Ellen DeGeneres has once again impressed her audience in creating the amazing character that Dory is. While there are many characters that are familiar from Finding Nemo, there are new and unfamiliar ones that are great additions to the movie as well. There are many flashbacks in the film that refer back to Dory as a young girl. This adorable little fish was voice-acted by Sloane Murray, who does an exquisite job of making the audience fall in love with little Dory. Co-stars from the hit TV show Modern Family, Ty Burrell and Ed O'Neill make the voices of new characters Bailey and Hank. Aside from Bailey, another whale that is unknown is Destiny, voiced by Kaitlyn Olson. All of these amazing and hilarious voice actors are crucial to making Finding Dory a great film.There are many emotional, happy, and funny moments throughout the entire film that help make it a great story. Directors Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane made sure to always make Dory's disability of short-term memory loss apparent from beginning to end of the movie, which sparks emotion for the audience. Finding Dory is a great especially for the younger audience in the fact that it teaches friendship, teamwork, and that your family is one of the most important things in life. It teaches that just because you have a disability doesn't mean that you can't do anything you set your mind to and you can still achieve many things in life. It also encourages risk- taking and not to be afraid of doing something just because you wouldn't normally do it. Watching this movie gives you the idea to not just sit around and do nothing for the rest of your life and to make the best of it. Reminiscing on Dory's past life makes Finding Dory that much better. Knowing what she had to go through and remembering things to help her through her journey are heart-warming and good life lessons to teach the audience. The animation in this film was indescribable. Its vibrant colors makes the film look very clear. Pixar never disappoints and they do an amazing job with modernizing cartoon's and fictional characters to make them more fun to watch. The beauty of the ocean's creatures and the beautiful colors that they use bring the movie to life moves Pixar to the next level. Even though prior to the sequel in the movie Finding Nemo, which was released in 2003, the characters still look and sound exactly the same. This is something that many movies and television shows lack as time goes on. It brings back the memory of Finding Nemo and the amazing characters that everyone knows and loves but adds in some hilarious ones to the mix that makes this movie different yet unforgettable.All in all, the film Finding Dory is a must-see. It is very hard to find negative things about it and Pixar has exceeded itself once again. It is hard not to fall in love with the beautifully animated characters and the amazing voice-actors that we all love. Great movie."
" Another Rollicking Undersea Adventure
",0.3182,0.9931,2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"""Finding Nemo"" was a landmark, five-star Pixar film both in terms of visuals and locale (underwater world). ""Finding Dory"" takes that winning formula, tweaks it just a bit, and produces another rollicking (if slightly less groundbreaking) undersea adventure.For a basic plot summary, ""Finding Dory"" focuses on Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the forgetful little blue tang fish. Early on in the film, Dory--now part of Marlin (Albert Brooks) & Nemo's (Hayden Rolence) family--remembers that she once had parents of her own, and thus the trio hitch a ride with Crush (Andrew Stanton) for the currents of California. Arriving at a Sea World-esque aquatic park, Dory is helped by a number of newcomers to the franchise, such as Hank the octopus (Ed O'Neil), Destiny the whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and Bailey the Beluga whale (Ty Burrell).Basically, ""Finding Dory"" takes the same basic plot formula (rescue adventure) of ""Finding Nemo"" and just breathes some new life/characters into it. This approach doesn't really break much new ground, but perhaps such a formula doesn't need to be ""messed with"". I was chuckling at many jokes throughout (all the new characters fit in nicely), and found myself mostly caught up in the sense of adventure.Probably the most interesting choice of the entire experience was Disney/Pixar's focus on Dory's ""disability"" (short-term memory loss). For the most part, that is where the emotion of the film comes from...seeing Dory overcome her weaknesses and even turn them into strengths. Whereas in the first film Dory was pretty much played as just the comic relief, this time her personal struggles comprise the main narrative structure of the entire flick.Why not the full five stars? Simply put: because Toy Story 2 was better than Toy Story. Somehow, someway, Disney/Pixar managed to have that sequel transcend its spectacular original, and that didn't necessarily happen here. My final star ranking would be 4.5/5.0, if able.Overall, though, I very much enjoyed the experience of watching ""Finding Dory"". It's an amazing experience to look around the theater and see people of all ages enjoying the same film. I give Disney/Pixar a lot of credit for that. If you were swept away by ""Finding Nemo"", you'll get the same kind of adventure/comedy in ""Finding Dory""."
" Why supporting characters are supporting characters
",0.7003,0.9206,2017-02-21 00:00:00,4,"As we learned from Cars 2, bringing a supporting cast member - in that case, Mater - to lead a sequel often essentially makes the side the entree. Watching 2 hours - and wow, is this thing too long - of Dory doing cutesy stuff and forgetting stuff becomes grindingly tedious. The miracle of ""Finding Nemo"" grew out of the animators finding a way for small fish, who are essentially prisoners of the vast and largely featureless water, to have often land-based adventures without unduly straining credulity. ""Finding Dory"" lacks the inventiveness when it comes to working around the limitations of the aquatic by employing an octopus who luckily doesn't need to be kept wet, who breathes are, can drive a truck, can match any background he squishes against, and who happens to have fine motor skills. Sure real octopi can open a jar to get a fish out but riding a stroller like a wheelchair comes across as a wincey bit unrealistic. The underwater seascapes drawn by the animators are amazingly realistic and if you just turn down the sound of the humorless and dull dialog, the movie is on whole beautiful to look at. There's just too much of it to look at with a runtime that features way too much swimming of small fish through pipes or underwater paths or sunken freighters. In short, Pixar needed to spend more resources on the script and less on the animation."

The way that title character, Dory, is treated for example, is a little close to home and clearly intends to do so. Meanwhile, supporting characters such as: Hank (the septopus); Becky (seagull); and Gerald (sea lion) are each given turns to be routinely ridiculed by their peers (even Marlin!), undermined, oppressed or generally downtrodden.Thankfully, each is given somewhat of an opportunity to succeed in the face of animosity and this, combined with the joyous cameos of Cockney Sea lions, a short-sighted Whaleshark and fan-favourite Crush, do provide moments of light amongst the general dour atmosphere the film appears determined to remain confined to."

",0.5563,0.8522,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Ellen DeGeneres reprises her role as Dory in ""Finding Dory,"" the sequel to ""Finding Nemo."" DeGeneres has flashbacks of being a young fish and having parents, so she decides to find her parents based on the miniscule clues that her limited memory gives. With the help of little Nemo and Marlin from the previous movie, Degeneres starts a long, dangerous, crazy and fun adventure that may give her closure, or may find her lost forever.My most memorable, movie moment is the scene when we first see Hank, the octopus (voiced by Ed O'Neill) do his trick of blending in to the environment. The character easily steals the show in this movie, being the most interesting and most fun to watch with his stealthy, ninja/secret agent moves and tricks.I found ""Finding Dory"" to be almost as good as ""Finding Nemo,"" with Hank the octopus being the most interesting, animated character I have seen in years. As usual, Pixar has hit another home run, albeit this one doesn't go as far as some of their other movies have.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" A great squeal
",0.6249,0.9958,2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Disney and Pixar have a tendency to create bad sequels. Finding Dory is not one of those movies. It follows Dory, Merlin's sidekick in the first movie. The Movie has some sadder parts to it, but these parts are few and never get to the levels of other classic Disney flicks. The Movie is mostly funny, I found myself laughing a lot. The comedy mainly surrounds the Character Dory and her chronic memory loss. The bit is done enough to get plenty of laughs, but not enough to get old. The movie brings back many of the characters from the first movie including, of course, Merlin and Nemo. A hand full of new characters are added and play well of Dory and the other characters. It's paced well and the plot has a few twists that keep it interesting. The climax is epic but you know everything is going to turn out fine, which does take a little away from the climax. I don't think is has to be said but the animation is stunning and the movie looks great, I mean what did you expect its Pixar.Overall the movie is excellent, Its great for kids and its great for adults. It isn't the most epic movie of 2016 or the most thought- provoking, but it is one of the most entertaining. If you have the means check it out."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.9396,2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"The movie itself was in my opinion disappointing. Maybe it's just me being grown up (which I doubt) but the movie was just lacking so much. Didn't laugh or even smile once throughout the movie. It was just meh i didn't feel like there was any humor in the movie and there wasn't any exciting parts either. After more than 10 years from finding Nemo to this it's just disappointing. I'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying it's not as good as expected. There wasn't any part where i felt danger or where i felt that dory getting lost was actually important at all Music didn't make me feel anything through the whole movie. Animation could've been better as well. Could probably still be a good movie for kids but for people who already watched finding Nemo and who watches lots of movies its just not worth the money"
" A movie for the special needs fish in your life

But ultimately the movie follows the Rudolph the Rednosed Reindeer concept of triumph over adversity.While the movie starts off slowly, it hits its stride around the halfway mark as the plot picks up and a chameleon squid comes along to goose the comedy. Overall the movie is quite fun, offering some clever ideas, solid humor, and touching moments that emphasize the strength's that allow Dory to overcome her weaknesses. While not as good as Finding Nemo, Finding Dory is a cute little movie that is well worth watching."
" Too unrealistic for my taste.
",0.0,0.9952,2017-02-05 00:00:00,2,"The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because of Gerald's sweet eyebrows and Becky because I like birds. Saying it's a kids' movie doesn't cut it since adults watch the movie, too. And yes, they're talking fish, but against everything else, you might as well have put a rabbit in the water and gave it underwater-breathing powers with the way this film is structured. Why would a solitary clownfish in the Great Barrier Reef know what California was, let alone where? How did he find the migrating turtles again and so easily? Why did they bring Nemo on the adventure? Not to mention, within the coast of California is a pocket of cold water that brings in sweet spawning fish but threatening temperatures to the tropical fish friends. Toxins and pH levels are a big thing for fish, and Marlin and Dory are no exceptions, so why California of all places? Wouldn't it have made sense to just create a fake aquarium in Australia and have the gang go there?Octopi do have the ability to camouflage and stay out of water for periods of time, but the speed at which Hank moves is disturbing and too quick for a real octopus. At that point, we'd have lots of land-dwelling, rock-hopping octopi on our beaches, would't we? And there really was no point of Hank wanting to live his life out peacefully in a tank if he was going to die in a couple of years if he was lucky. Octopi sadly don't live very long despite their high intelligence. Speaking of intelligence, how did Dory learn to read? Who taught her? If it was her parents, who taught them? Were there--pardon me--schools of fish to teach the English language? Dory also speaks whale, but Destiny is not a whale; she is a shark, a fish. she's also a fish that can leap completely out of an enclosure which doesn't make sense because she doesn't have the capability of swimming fast enough to gain enough velocity to propel her enormous weight out of said water. I also feel bad because when it said Dory was part of the open ocean exhibit and I see all these fish bunched up in a tall column of water, I couldn't help but feel sorry for all of the sunfish, sharks, tuna, and turtles that obviously weren't crammed in the appropriate exhibit name. You couldn't even get the name of the exhibit right. Open ocean means open ocean, not claustrophobic tropical reef pipe. Bailey's echolocation is over-powered. Echolocation doesn't work the same out of water as it does in the water. How did the sound travel so far and span out across a 360-degree area and feed into his brain fast enough for him to process the spatial awareness around him? The water-hopping with Marlin and Nemo wasn't great, either. They went from cold California-hardened seawater to freshwater to mop water and then to fresh/seawater again. In the case that the changes in water didn't kill them, they would be very very sick. Also how is Nemo still a kid? It's been a year. ""He"" should have reached sexual maturity by now, and he should've matured into a she with the current (ha) conditions. Why are Dory's parents still alive? Blue tangs need warm water to survive. How did they live in the cold California Pacific for that long? What about in winter when the temperatures and currents change? Pixar, your studio is a hop and a skip away to the ocean. What happened to consulting marine biologists on this? Do people genuinely find it funny when an octopus and blue tang hijack a van with hundreds of fishy lives and pile it through busy traffic, potentially killing and harming dozens of innocent people? I'd hope not, but that's what I got from this movie. At the end of the movie, everyone followed them all the way back to the Great Barrier Reef. Beluga whales live in cold waters where their proper food spawn. Doesn't that put stress on Bailey? What if I threw the writers of this film into the Antarctic to join their penguin friends without proper equipment and told them to find food and shelter without any knowledge of the area? Is that heartwarming and entertaining? No.The movie itself, was really bland. I almost envisioned the whole thing as a high-budget movie-based video game with smooth graphics. The areas are divided specifically like dungeons with obstacles and stealth sequences. However, nothing in the movie stood out to me in memory. I don't remember any dialogue being spoken from the characters, I had little care for the fish. This movie didn't even feel like a movie. It's like they got middle-school writers to write a G-rated fan-fiction ""Finding Nemo"" adventure for their 4-year old sibling who wanted a story about Dory finding her parents because of a single exchange of dialogue uttered in the film. I think it was deliberately made because someone wanted to make another movie just because? I'm not sure, so don't take it seriously, but if that was the case, then it clearly shows. The kids might like this film. Disney-blind consumers and Pixar enthusiasts might like it, but not me. I felt like I spent the course of 2 hours verbally criticizing this garbage with my family, and that, coupled with Gerald's sweet eyebrows and Becky's cameo, were the only forms of entertainment I got out of it all. Not the story, not the characters, and definitely not the writing or logic. Oh gosh, it was bad."

",0.0,0.9966,2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"This is a sequel for one of Pixar's beloved classics, focusing on Dory the forgetful fish, who appear as a minor character in 'Finding Nemo'. Nemo and his father appear in 'Finding Dory' but are out of the spotlight so it's not really a direct sequel.Dory is an adorable character. She inspires pity and sympathy, as even the easiest tasks are very difficult for her and she is painfully aware of her own shortcomings. None of the problems that she creates are her own fault: she is intelligent and has a kind heart, she merely has a condition that makes her life difficult.I have known several elderly people with memory problems, and it is always heartbreaking to see. Even more so when the condition plagues someone young. We get glimpses of Dory's childhood and see how her parents do their best to give her a safe environment to play around and teach her to deal with the problems that could possibly arise in the future. And they taught her well, as we see Dory overcome the obstacles that chance throws at her.So it's a humane story about dealing with a condition. But it's also an animated adventure movie. There are sidekicks and twists and turns, beautiful locations and physical comedy. The CGI looks pretty much flawless. The water and lighting especially are gorgeous, and the schools of fish are colorful, and the way the octopus moves is a delight."
" 'Finding Dory' gets lost in the sea.
",-0.3182,0.999,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Another Pixar sequel is here, and this time it takes place under water with 'Finding Dory', the sequel to the 2003 hit 'Finding Nemo'. Wow, has it really been thirteen years since Pixar made $940 million off that cute orange fish? Well, Pixar is in the sequel making business these days, and with 'Finding Dory', they seem to have made an enjoyable and entertaining sequel that has some funny moments, but misses the mark on the heart and soul of the first film – not to mention the lack of creative story telling devices that the first movie had throughout. I'm sure this sequel will make a huge splash with all audiences, but the kids are more likely to eat this up than the adults.Taking place a year after the first film, Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo (Hayden Rolence), and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) are enjoying life in the reef, where Marlin is still worried about everything, Nemo is loving school, and Dory is still forgetting everything, due to her short term memory loss condition. Somehow, she remembers she has a parents (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy), and even stranger is that she somehow remembers where they live, which is in California. Soon, she enlists the help of Marlin and Nemo, and the trio are off from Australia to California via a recognizable sea of turtles. This is where I thought the plot would thicken with adventure, but in a split second, the trio is in California, where the bulk of the movie takes place at a dreary Monterey Marine Life Institute, which is more like an aquarium, leaving the vast ocean life on the back burner this time.Things get a bit silly and ridiculous from here on out in the form of Dory trying to enlist the help of other animals to get herself inside the aquarium. Perhaps the best addition to this sequel is in the form of a color/shape shifting octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill), who is perfectly content being inside a tank and not in the vast ocean abyss. He's super funny in a good dry way. Other supporting characters include a near-sighted whale-shark and a Beluga whale who can't use its auditory sense very well. They are also welcome additions, but don't serve much purpose. There are some genuine moments and a decent, if not jumbled message for the kids, as well as some good laughs, but it doesn't pack the creativity nor the current that the first film had.Visually, the film is stunning, and maybe one of the BEST looking Pixar films to date. Every nuance of sea life and underwater scene is intricate with the finest of details and fully immerses you into this world. The voice work is spot on and Ellen DeGeneres shines as Dory, while Ed O'Neill and Albert Brooks pack some good laughs. Even though, a lot of the charm and boldness of the first film is gone here, 'Finding Dory' is still worth seeing. Be sure to stay until after the credits for a great sequence involving some cameos and a trio of hilarious sea lions.WORTH A LOOK!"
" Proof that not every successful film automatically needs a sequel
",-0.4717,0.9535,2017-01-20 00:00:00,2,"I went to watch this with my man and his employee and it was disappointing. I have Finding Nemo on DVD and like it very much. My only merits for this film are for the noble intentions of Nemo and his father, besides that, this is almost 2 hours of my life I won't get back, this film drags on so much that by the first hour I felt like I'd spent a full day watching it and on top of that I still had very little connection to the characters and their story hadn't even started. Second hour hit, still nothing, I was almost asleep. hahahaaha an octopus that is missing tentacles, not really. I might as well have been asleep, the story was still stagnant. As a sequel, it's like watching paint dry, it just doesn't get going. If you have the time to spare and have nothing better to do or watch then by all means, watch this film, but if you have something better do with your time then please, avoid this film. The length of the film doesn't justify the lack of story or the cinematic prowess, this could very easily have been a half hour short film. I can say none of us enjoyed much about this film. My bf thought it was empty and his employee thought it was strictly for children whereas the prequel was for children and adults. On the bright side we went home afterwards and had good satisfying sex until midnight so it was a good day."
" Very good but not as good as Finding Nemo
",0.7496,0.9963,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Finding Dory is basically the same as Nemo but it's Dory's turn now. The story line is quite good actually and the characters are very funny and characteristic. If i am being honest, it's not as good as the first one as it's not as interesting and good as the first one. Firstly the comedy was a bit too much but the first one was more emotional than comical. My sister enjoyed it but she's only eight. I, however am 13 and I like good animation like Toy Story 3 and Frozen and The Jungle Book. But this wasn't as good as those past Pixar films. So I was a little disappointed.But as I carried on watching, I realised that the film wasn't that bad and actually had quite good voice overs and a good enough story line. All I will say is don't get too hyped or you'll be a little disappointed. It's a good film but a little bad compared the Pixar's last films like Toy Story 3 and Frozen and Wreck it Ralph."

Just like the previous film, which has gained a cult status, the animation and sequences are pretty marvelous. I guess it would be much more a lavish experience if you watch it on a big screen. It takes you to the world inside the water under the seas, pipes, aquariums, and buckets. Through the superb animation and a fast pace, it holds you and entertains you for its entire length. Though there is a lot of happenings in the film, it is not an improvement over ""Finding Nemo,"" in terms of story or characters. Dory lacks the charm spelled by Nemo; and it kinda drops to unbelievable clichés in the end. In comparison, ""Finding Nemo"" is still preferable.Rating: 2 stars out of 4"

But it's a movie that kids will have a lot of fun with and is watchable for adults. It isn't a Pixar movie with a lot of depth, deep meaning and messages when it comes to the story. But it's a simple and yet creative movie about Dory who has short-term memory trying to find her parents. With the help of her friends and acquaintances. Sure it can get tedious at times and it isn't a movie I would watch over and over again. But what makes this simple movie work is it's creativity and the situations the fishes and other sea animals gets into. And creative ways they go about it when trying to get out of danger and finding their way to certain locations. This isn't a sequel that I felt was necessary but it doesn't take anything away either.6.5/10"
" I liked Finding Dory! Very cute and touching.

I have seen some of the negative comments but I must say, I enjoyed it. In every show, we can find fault. The part that I found to be the best was when you come to realize why Dory says, ""Just keep swimming!"" Because in ""Finding Nemo"" we all sort of judge her. This teaches us to love people, right where they are at because you just never know why people are, like they are.The underwater scenes are much like it is when you snorkel or scuba dive. I found the colors vibrant! The music was nice!I liked it, bought it and will watch it some more!"
" Finding Dory meets a fun, heartwarming return to one of Pixar's most classic features
",0.7506,0.9988,2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Pixar Animation Studios rarely falls short of beautiful, heartwarming features since their debut in 1995 when they delivered the revolutionary 'Toy Story'. Whether their biggest gem is their stellar technical abilities or their gift of bringing their heart-touching stories to life before our very eyes, Pixar never stops delivering the goods. Easily one of their most classic entries is director Andrew Stanton's 2003 feature 'Finding Nemo' which took audiences everywhere in an under-the-sea odyssey of a lovable clown fish in search of his lost son while acquiring the help of a funny, amnesiac blue tang. 13 years have passed and Pixar has managed to bring back most of our characters from the original and take us on another ride for relatively similar adventure. The biggest change here is unlike the predecessor which found Marlin and Dory searching for the young titular character, this one finds a new character in the Nemo's former position. And that is character is no one other than the lovable Dory, the fish suffering from her notorious short-term memory loss. Set one year after the events of the original, clown fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (voiced by Hayden Rolence) are home with the latter attending school and Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) being a helping hand with raising Nemo. Meanwhile, Dory is haunted by the memories of her family who she lost as a child, prompting her to set out to reunite with them. However, when she is unexpectedly kidnapped and placed in a Californian public aquarium, Marlin and Nemo was set out to rescue her.When the original hit theaters back in the spring of 2003, Dory is by far the biggest show-stealer of the feature. Bringing on non-stop hilarity with her short-term memory loss and constantly being a burden to Marlin's search of his son due to her inability to remembering anything longer than a few seconds, why wouldn't it be a good idea to explore deep into the origins of this lovable character? This film opens with a long flashback of Dory as a young child with her parents, and how her parents coped with her short-term memory loss which is handled surprisingly well. Rather than establishing Dory as a source of utter annoyance, the story maturely handles her mental predicament as sympathy. Some time later, she finds herself separated from her parents and struggling vigorously to find them. Afterwards, the film jumps to the present with her living with Marlin and Nemo from the previous entry and that is when the story finally kicks off. Like the original film, her amnesia still lingers and is constantly struggling trying to memorize simple things longer than a matter of seconds. But as the adventure begins and the characters making fateful efforts on helping her reunite with her long-lost family, the film not ingeniously handles her amnesiac disorder with substance but effectively established Dory as a self-aware burden who knows her mental disability causes trouble. And this easily stands as one of the most emotional and heartfelt elements of the story. There is plenty of fun (including a ridiculous car chase at the end) and certainly plenty of laughs to be handed on this adventure. And as this is Pixar, the film also holds a fair share of touching moments, though it never reaches the level of being a tear-jerker like 'Up' or the 'Toy Story' series.While we witness the return of our characters from the original entry (some of which are reserved for a post-credits scene), we also encounter a range of some new colorful characters along the way. First of which is Hank the Red Octupus (voiced by Ed O'Neill) who becomes a faithful companion for Dory on her wild adventure through the aquarium. Similarly to Dory, he provides a good share of laughter throughout his time on screen. Then there is some childhood friends of Dory including Destiny (voiced by Kaitlin Olsen) the Whale Shark and Bailey (voiced by Ty Burrell) the Beluga Whale who both become helping hands along the way. Idris Alba and Dominic West both provide the voices of sea lions who have a few good laughs but spend most of their time lying on a rock while hogging from a another sea lion in a comedic competition (they are not much help). Becky, a black-furred bird and piercing red eyes who doesn't provide much dialogue other than a series of loud squawks but also slips a few laughs for the kiddies. Each and every one the characters here are vastly likable and the film makes a rare surprise to providing a story without the presence of an actual villain (at least not in character form. With all great intentions, it works astoundingly well. And who can forget about the photo-realistic computer animation used to bring both the world and the characters to life.Finding Dory is a heartwarming animated adventure that delivers a surprisingly touching continuation to Pixar's classic 2003 original. This film is a joyful sure to please both children and adults alike. Predictably so, it may be not endure as memorably as it's predecessor. Regardless, it doesn't have to be. Anyone who enjoyed the previous film is almost guaranteed to enjoy this one without a single noticeable flaw."
" Despite an overly talky Act I, Pixar's animated fish tale will charm you incessantly in Acts II and III
",0.4019,0.994,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Thirteen years ago Pixar released the mega-successful Finding Nemo starring two clownfish, Marlin and Nemo, with their buddy, a regal blue tang fish named Dory. Albert Brooks is back as Marlin and Ellen Degeneres again plays Dory, saddled throughout with short-term memory loss. Finding Dory amounts to a spin off of Finding Nemo, with Dory now playing the lead and Marlin and Nemo doing the honors as gracious sidekicks.Perhaps the most problematic aspect of the Finding Dory narrative is the Act One machinations. The inciting incident involves Dory's separation from her parents who are part of an open ocean exhibit at a rehabilitative Marine Institute in California; after she's caught in an undertow Dory finds herself on the other side of the Pacific and is reunited with Marlin and Nemo.Dory, with her short term memory loss, represents an opportunity not only to exploit comic possibilities but also to make an important point that parents who have children with developmental disabilities should never give up on them and continue to encourage whatever latent abilities to improve themselves, they might possess.Dory's parents, Jenny and Charlie (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy) are the prototypical nurturers who make periodic appearances in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. Despite all the approbation, Dory still suffers from lack of self-esteem, and it's only through her journey of self-discovery that she overcomes her self-deprecating self-absorption.The scenarists perhaps at this juncture have made the mistake of explicating Dory's predicament ad infinitum, resulting in a lugubrious Act One, featuring much too much talk and little action. There's a nice little scene of a stingray migration, Dory, Marlin and Nemo hitching a ride on the back of a sea turtle taking them to California and perhaps the only scary moment for young children— an encounter with a menacing squid who puts a nice little scare into our determined protagonists.Surprisingly, it's the voice of Sigourney Weaver playing herself that signals the break into an exciting and much more gripping Act Two—here Weaver is the voice of the Marine Institute, where our fish heroes interact with a coterie of human characters devoted to creating obstacles which prevent Dory from both finding her parents and ultimately saving her best buddies, Marlin and Nemo.When Dory is inadvertently twisted up in a six-pack ring, she's scooped up by staff members from the Marine Institute and tagged and sent to the quarantine section. There she's aided by the seven-legged octopus, Hank, who oddly derides ocean life and would prefer to live out the rest of his days in quarantine (in Cleveland of all places)—all Hank wants is Dory's tag and he agrees first to help her find her parents.Dory ultimately learns that her fellow regal blue tangs are all in quarantine and probably hold the secret as to the fate of her parents. Along the way at one of the exhibits, Dory meets her childhood friend Destiny, a benign, near-sighted whale shark, and her companion, Bailey, a beluga whale who's been attempting to recover his powers of Echolocation after a purported head injury. Note that the two whales are as goofy as Dory and are another example of the intentionally designed non- threatening marine life, guaranteed not to scare away younger viewers.Both Dory as well as Marlin and Nemo take circuitous routes to arrive back in quarantine. Hank, operating a runaway stroller with his tentacles through the Institute, is guided by Dory, who gives directions while ensconced in a fishbowl. They end up in the enormously clever children's ""Touch Pool,"" where they both are almost scooped up by ""possessed"" children, desperate for contact with the sedentary marine life in the pool beneath. Only Hank's sudden release of black ink flooding the pool, saves our protagonists from not accomplishing their ultimate objectives.Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo have their set of allies who aid them in their quest to find Dory. The hilarious sea lions Fluke and Rudder end up summoning the disfigured loon, Becky, and are aided by the nerdy Gerald, who provides the pail for Becky to transport Marlin and Nemo into the innermost cave of the Institute. Once inside, Marlin and Nemo propel themselves out of a tank by hopping over columns of jet sprays. Once Dory, Marlin and Nemo are reunited, Dory faces the ""dark moment"" at the end of ACT 2—where she incorrectly comes to believe that her parents have died—after her encounter with her fellow regal blue tangs. Fortunately, the dire belief is short- lived, once Dory finds the shells her parents have left for her—now she has a joyous reunion with her parents who reveal they've waited for her this whole time. Note here Dory loses her self-pity and becomes self- actualized—now she must save Marlin and Nemo who are still stuck in the truck headed for Cleveland that has just left the Institute.Despite their absurdity (and perhaps that's what makes it so enjoyable), the Act 3 machinations are very satisfying. How does Dory get the truck to stop so he and Hank can take command of it? Just have a bunch of very cute otters crawl up the side of the bridge, crawl out onto the highway, and stop traffic. How does the truck, pointed in the wrong direction, get back to the Institute? Just have Hank grab control of the steering wheel with Dory again providing directions, ensconced inside a fish bowl this time on the truck's dashboard! And finally dig the slow motion scene where the truck crashes through the railings, the back door flings open and all the fish fall back into the ocean.Despite its slow start, Finding Dory morphs into an adorable animated action film for both adults and children. Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks manage to finely provide the obligatory comic relief as well as important encouragement for parents and children who are dealing with the spectre of childhood developmental disabilities."

The force awakens... reheated, rehashed, rescripted film that rips off the original with no charm, no reason to exist and has the original voices show up not for fun, integrity or art but for a fast pay cheque. Full stop.It's compared to Finding Nemo and has some of the same cast and crew. However, this film is no Finding Nem. While it follows a similar structure to the prequel, the ""colour by numbers"" themes, songs and travel feel a bit tired. I enjoy the sea theme and feel they could have made this a great film, but they have made a OK film that is good for recent immigrants and refugees who did not see the original. This developmentally challenged character uses the ""ocean"" where Finding Nemo used the reef, sea, ocean and the world as a metaphor. The main song is boring, but not as boring as Frozen or Moana. The truck and fish out of water sequences are wholly unrealistic and very very lazy."
