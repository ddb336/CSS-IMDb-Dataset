" Took me 6 years to finally watch it
",0.0,-0.9895,2021-02-06 00:00:00,6,"I love romantic movies and this movies has been popping up on suggested movies on multiple platforms for me for years! I finally watched it and I was disappointed. For a break up story, it was bad. But I never been a huge fan of sad endings unless they are done really well. This was done well but not amazing. I definitely got the impression that they should not be together and their relationship was toxic. I don't understand how you could only be having the caliber of problems they were having at the end of their relationship. She had a abusive when drunk problem, he had a cheating problem. Those aren't problems that just happen suddenly after 6 years of being together...in my opinion. I just found myself asking the whole movie, how did this relay even reach 6 years."
" Too much left unsaid.
",0.0,0.8499,2021-01-12 00:00:00,6,"This movie portrays an unhealthy relationship with little character development. Despite having been together for 6 years, Mel and Dan failed to recognize the reality of their relationship. I enjoyed the scenes that realistically showed them together. It was relatable as a viewer. But ultimately, they were toxic for each other. Mel & Dan's backstory should have been more elaborated, to help the audience better understand the dynamics of their relationship."
" Real
",0.0,0.8399,2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,"It's raw, it's real, it's amazing. I absolutely loved it."
" This movie is an eye opener! It doesn't sugar-coat relationships. I recommend it!!
",-0.4563,0.4078,2020-11-03 00:00:00,7,The acting wasn't amazing but not that bad either. I like the fact it realistically portraits the long term relationship and doesn't sugar coat it. I could really relate to some of the events(excluding any agressive behavior). This movie was honestly therapy and made me realize so many things i had been wrong about. This is not a movie i'd usually watch but this such an eye opener if you are in a toxic relationship. I think the reviews for this movie are not that good because this film is realistic.
" If Taissa just kept her fingers out of her hair ...
",0.0,0.69,2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,....cause seing her running them 10 times a minute robbed me of all the attention to their acting which aside from this was great and gave credibility to a very realistic portrayal of a teen-gone-adult relation and it's challenges!
" Yikes
",0.0,0.1695,2020-07-11 00:00:00,2,"I watch a lot of movies, I don't leave a lot of reviews. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the most movies I've seen. That is all."
" Mixed feelings...
",0.0,0.8936,2020-06-23 00:00:00,5,"I'm not sure about this one. At first I really liked where it was going and then it kind of flopped.The thing is, this is pretty unrealistic behavior to just suddenly come out of no where in a relationship of 6 years. At least behavior of THIS severity.
The girl (Mel) displays some serious anger issues and physically abusive behavior while the guy (Dan) has no communication skills whatsoever and also displays a lot of emotional issues and abuse. How were these two good for 6 YEARS with none of these things ever coming up before? Lol.You can't catch a break with this film, as soon as you feel bad for one character they turn around and do something equally as messed up.
It's a perfect example of a toxic relationship and in that sense, yeah it's a pretty realistic example. I'm just not sure how this seemingly perfect couple got to that point all of a sudden.
It definitely left me feeling upset though, which was likely the goal, so good job there... and yeah, that's about it. Nothing incredibly special but worth the watch, sure. All in all just don't really agree with the story line and it's believability.The two main actors were wonderful though. Except yes, Taissa does literally touch her hair more than Kristen Stewart does in the first Twilight movie lol."
" if it was a film for shampoo, it would have been good
",0.4404,-0.9198,2020-05-15 00:00:00,5,"Could she touch her hair more? Seriously, wtf is wrong with this actress? That's all she does in *every* scene. And when she doesn't, you can literally see her stopping herself from touching her hair. I mean, that's some inspiring acting right there.
This is a film that tries so hard to be cool, but ends up showing how bad it is at faking it."
" Ok, what's the point of the movie?
",0.296,-0.8641,2020-04-17 00:00:00,4,"I love independent movies, but this looks like a bad rip off of Newness. Acting was so-so, story was as if written by troubled, masochistic 17 year old. All in all.. meh."
" I Love taissa farmiga but..
",0.6369,-0.7269,2020-04-02 00:00:00,4,I Love taissa farmiga but this film is horrible. Boring
" disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.9781,2020-02-17 00:00:00,3,"I started this film with an intention to watch a cute, touching relationship. But it was so frustrating in so many ways even the way that she touches her hair. The relationship that they've had is a no doubt toxic relationship. Besides the other factors the senario wasnt meaningful and strong enough and doesnt makes sense at all. So it was full of disappointing. Also the girl which is one of the main characters is so annoying."
" Worth seeing
",0.2263,0.3904,2020-01-25 00:00:00,6,"I thought this was a fine little teen drama. I liked the lead actress, but everyone did a good job with the material. It's about a young couple who grow apart after being together for literally six years. The boy gets a job offer and they end up arguing about it, he goes off and sleeps with someone else, and they break up. Twice in this movie, the girl gets so emotional that she injures her boyfriend, and he ends up in the emergency room. Worth a watch."
" I watched this film twice
",0.0,0.2382,2019-11-09 00:00:00,6,It was good at first for the first time I watched it but then... I don't know...
" film did not arouse any empathy
",0.0,0.9474,2019-10-16 00:00:00,3,"I could not feel for Mel or Dan the whole movie. Their 6 year long relationships was not believable. At some points it seemed like their two newly in love teenager who are too shy to act normal around each other.
There also was no chance to feel with either Mel or Dan. The film didn't give me the chance. It was told more from the outside of the characters, more observing than feeling the inner thoughts.
Also the acting was not that good. Both were touching their hair all the time. Once Mel stopped Dan started.
Story was told way too fast. Once I started being a bit involved the film was over in that exact second. So you can say I liked the ending in a way.
During the film there were no big up and downs. I missed that. It lost the suspense very fast.Although I liked the way of giving her the part of being violent. It was not believable for her character and the way he portrayed it but still I liked the concept of switching the stereotypes.
In other scenes they felt for the stereotypes very much. Story-wise and how the supporting roles behaved.
If violence should have been the theme of the film it was too small in comparison. It would have been better it the theme went along all the film. Not necessarily shown in all scenes and the plot but still be discussed. It felt more like a small side topic which was mentioned parenthetically.So all in all it needed to be more lively and it needed to give the audience a chance to get involved and feel with the couple or either Mel or Dan."
" Emotional, Romantic but still Reality of opportunities in Love-Career Pendulum swings
",0.6757,0.9952,2019-07-26 00:00:00,6,Romantic Saga One more... But there too some innocent borderline ethical tuning among the couple holds and survives the relationship. In parts very good lines like If we can pack our life in boxes...Mother giving advise of accepting the Job opportunity at the cost of distance intrusion into relationships....and certifying it is OK ! though it is pretty 6 yrs already and in all sum up building a career is more important then moving around love affairs. If the bond is powerful then why not a distance relationship and commuters fortnightly should be compromised. Borderline adultery is the only fear and that should be accepted tolerated or be managed... Director leaves the question un-answered and film ends. Love scenes plenty but some how it was perhaps deliberate attempt to show the chemistry among couple a little less then normal ... so that the 7 year itch concept and a little dissatisfaction could make convincing space for adultery chances in script.
" I DON'T WANNA BREAK UP
",0.0,-0.8374,2019-04-09 00:00:00,6,"Dan Mercer (Ben Rosenfield) and Melanie Clark (Taissa Farmiga) are in their last year of college and getting ready to go out into the real world. Dan is working as an intern for a record label and has their eye. Mel appears to be on her way to be an elementary school teacher at their home in Austin, Texas. Dan and Melanie have been together for 6 years. Melanie has become extremely co-dependent. She likes to drink, but is not good at it. Dan doesn't like her friends, and Melanie doesn't like Dan's work friends. Their relationship is at a crossroads where they can't live with each other, but can't live apart.After the 20 minute introduction of characters and the set up, the film started to slow up. There are some slow scenes. You have to ask, ""What is their problem?"" and then you remember what it was like to be that age. Of course if you are at that age and in that type of relationship, this film could be 5 stars for you. The film was well acted. Taissa nailed it. Good screen chemistry. I just couldn't get into the self imposed drama of their lives.Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief Internet nudity."
" Not worth warching
",-0.1695,-0.9356,2019-03-30 00:00:00,2,"This is so bad, I usually quite like films where not much happens but this really is awful. The story is dull, the chemistry between characters is non existent, I don't really understand what I'm supposed to have got from this film because hardly anything happened!Would not recommend watching this, there's so many more out there that are better! I only watched because I hate half watching things but really nothing happens it just ends."
" Underwhelming with a few redeeming qualities
",0.0,-0.5069,2019-01-22 00:00:00,5,"6 Years is a movie that feels more like a draft than a final product. Everything feels underdeveloped, especially the two leads. Mel and Dan are both awful people, and it feels like Hannah Fidell herself doesn't empathize with her characters. These are the people we're supposed to at least be invested in, but what's the point if neither the filmmaker nor the audience likes these people or wants them to be together? I get that this isn't a love story, but there still should be a certain level of empathy for the characters. However, there is none, and they're both careless without any sense of self-awareness.To be fair, Taissa Farmiga and Rosenfield both do very well with the material they're given. They improvised just about everything, though they couldn't do much beyond what Fidell gave them. Even though I'm writing this a few years after the film's release, I still hope they have lasting careers. They're believable as a couple, and they sell the final scene.I also think Fidell herself deserves some credit for exploring unhealthy relationships. Though I think it could have been done much better, unhealthy relationships are not often portrayed outside the Lifetime lens, so for her to create complex characters in this situation deserves commendation.Do I recommend it? I dunno. I cried when I watched it, but that was likely because I'd just had a breakup. If you've got time to kill, go for it, but it's not going to be the thought-provoking, life-altering experience it clearly wants to be."
" So many things that kill me!
",-0.7177,0.9735,2018-08-18 00:00:00,2,"If I could speak to the characters of the movie:(1) No girl should deal with that much self loathing to continue a relationship with such a douche bag!
(2) For the love of everything holy, please put your hair in a ponytail! 
(3) There is zero chemistry between you two, so please move on already.To the teens watching this movie:
(1) If the relationship between the main characters of this movie is a biopic of your life, please get help. To the powers to be:
(1) The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is for the acting. They are exceptional actorsI was flipping through Netflix and stumbled on this hour of my life I'll never get back. I went to high school. I'm sure there may have been one or two messed up couples who can relate to this story, but this storyline leads to a 48 Hours special. If you are looking for a romantic drama, I suggest ""To All the Boys I Loved Before."" At least you'll turn the TV off with a smile and not wondering if there really is such a thing as a ""healthy relationship."""
" That ending though....
",0.0,-0.7009,2018-07-26 00:00:00,5,I enjoyed the acting and I saw a little piece of me and my relationship minus the aggressive fighting and aggressive physical side. I think it speaks to a lot of us who have been in a long term relationship with someone from high school that's goes onto college. It's not easy being in a relationship and transitioning to adulthood. I would say that the ending sucked. It felt so abrupt.
" Honest comment
",0.5106,-0.2439,2018-07-22 00:00:00,1,Actually I liked the movie. I would rate 6 or 7 if the final scene didnt shoot like that. Dude made me angry take that damn chance plz
" Too bad
",-0.5423,0.0772,2018-05-09 00:00:00,1,"No sense movie, don't watch it. They are 6 years in relationship and they act like that... omg"
" A Sad Love Story
",0.2732,-0.9684,2018-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Why the rating is so bad, when the acting and content is not that bad tho ? 
For me, I don't need a breathtaking scene, just the normal things are pretty well done totally, remind me of my young age whatsoever. 
The two partners love each other but they keep hurting each other because of some piece of shits. 
The outsiders keep pushing them away, being suspicious about their love. 
The environments with pressure, burdens make them keep saying sorry instead of solving problems.
They're wonderful coz they can go together for so many years, but things change, it's hard to be cool for every situation in life. 
I don't know why this movie make me feel so sad, regretful somehow hurt in the deep of my heart."
" The flow of the story is pure reality
",0.0,0.509,2017-11-01 00:00:00,9,"Well first of all I love the casts especially dan and mel they are otp. I love the script it's legit close to reality. It's quiet dramatic and frustrating but that's life, right? I wasn't hesitant not a bit to give this movie a try and the 5/10 IMDb rating is worth basing on. I demand for part 2 though as it ended not quiet satisfying."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.8798,2017-09-25 00:00:00,3,"I got home after work and thought of watching Netflix. While scrolling through some movies, I stumbled upon this one. I wish I hadn't. The plot moves sooooo sloow you feel time has stopped while you were watching this.. The actors... It is sooo annoying seeing Mel running her hands through her hair every damn time!!! It's too unreal! Too boring! Too shallow! It is mt first time writing my opinion about a film. This is how much this film disappointed me."
" My favourite romance and one of my favourite films of all time!!
",0.6351,0.9307,2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"Now,knowing me,I don't review romances but I felt like I had to review this,6 Years. 6 Years stars Taissa Farmiga,from American Horror Story and the upcoming horror spin off,The Nun. The film is about a couple who after a few incidents,go down a dark path in there relationship which might rip it apart. This film..made me cry..Naaa!! I was joking! I did'int cry although at parts,I felt like it. The film was so true and it was really like..true. Unlike The Notebook or Titanic,this is so true and what actually happens in relationships. Trust me,I do love,Titanic..but 6 Years is so much better!!"
