" A true hero
",0.7506,0.9382,2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the movie really much. Tom Hanks certainly did a great job, and my feelings were going up and down with all the investigation and doubts that he had. It was also nice to see different perspectives, especially the one from the air traffic controller. I would totally watch again. 155, a miracle number."
" Keeps It Real
",0.0,0.9217,2021-04-05 00:00:00,9,"A simple story of a big event. Hanks does a good job as Sully, playing the calm and collected pilot who did the impossible by saving 155 people with a water landing. I like the way his subconscious begins doubting himself with the dreams and what-not. The hearing scene really finishes the film strong. Eastwood knows how to handle these stories well."
" Top class, as expected
",0.2023,0.9835,2021-03-21 00:00:00,9,"Top class, as expected.'Sully' is great. Tom Hanks absolutely nails it as the titular character, he is undoubtedly the perfect cast for the role. An outstanding actor, as we all know. The plot is told in a way that I personally enjoyed, I liked seeing the different snippets of time.Though no-one is on the same level as Hanks in this, there are a few other good performers. Aaron Eckhart (Jeff) does well, while there are less important roles for people like Anna Gunn (Elizabeth) and Michael Rapaport (Pete). I have no issues with the casting, that's for sure.It's a crazy true story, mad that it happened way back in 2009 - feels more recent, strangely. I assume it uses the usual creative license that practically every film does, which I'm fine with. It delivers as a quality film, which is all I truly care about."
" A well executed film but it felt limited by the source material
",-0.2023,0.9967,2021-03-17 00:00:00,7,"The story of Captain Sully's impressive water landing on the Hudson is nothing short of remarkable, and it was all very well executed in this film adaptation.Hanks was very solid in his role as Sully. It wasn't particularly a standout performance, but I don't think the script ever really allowed him to be at his best. It was a very well measured and spot on performance, drawing us into the film and character like only Hanks can.The direction from Eastwood was very good. There were some fantastic shots, an inspired decision to opt for non-linear story telling, and a great tone that overlay the whole film. He also made the great decision to make the film no longer than it needed to be. There was very little unnecessary fat on the bones of the story. Every scene was relevant and had a distinct purpose, bringing the picture in at a crisp 90 minute runtime.The only real reason I haven't scored Sully higher is that I felt the story was always quite limited. As mentioned, it was a truly remarkable feat and the film does a great job of explaining just why, but the story didn't always have legs. There were attempts to inject tension with the proceedings that followed the 'forced water landing' (not crash), but these never felt that real or serious. In terms of the landing, the scenes were genuinely quite emotional and moving, but as its based on a real story there wasn't much jeopardy as we knew the outcome.Therefore while there is nothing particularly wrong with Sully, in fact it does a great job of capturing the moment, I just felt like it didn't have enough. Not enough to intrigue, excite, impact or move me.A good film and definitely worth watching, but always somewhat limited with the story it was telling."
" 3 minutes worth of movie stretched out to 90 minutes
",0.2263,-0.554,2021-03-12 00:00:00,5,"An interesting very short tale within an otherwise very bland movie that probably shouldn't have been made, because there's 45 minutes worth of documentary here at best, not a 90+ minute movie.Let's face it: the landing is what this is about. That was a miracle. There was a happy ending. But this lasted only around 3 minutes, leaving us with about 87 more minutes to fill.There simply isn't much more to the story, so the creators decided to inject some villains in the shape of the NTSB, in order to create some tension and an actual story to go on with. This however just turns out really disappointing and rather unbelievable.And guess why it's unbelievable? Because it is. It's not true; it never happened like that. Quite frankly this left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Why would you ruin a miraculous story with such a happy ending like that?Acting is great, cinematography is great. The movie as a whole just isn't. 5,5/10, rounding down to a 5."

We expect more from Clint, and he's obviously coasting along these days."
" Sully: Miracle on the Hudson
",0.5859,0.9922,2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,"I first found out about the true story when it was mentioned on the Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2009, then the real-life hero had a cameo in Daddy's Home 2, so I was looking forward to watching this film all about why he became famous, directed by Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, J. Edgar, Richard Jewell). Based on the true story, on January 15, 2009, US Airways pilots Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and First Officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) board US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 ft (850 m), a flock of Canada geese strike and disable both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach either LaGuardia or Teterboro Airport, Sully sees no choice but to crash land on the Hudson River. All 155 crew and passengers survive the crash, some with minor injuries. The plane is evacuated as its slowly fills with water, onto the plane's floatation devices and onto the wings. The water is freezing, making it near impossible for passengers to attempt swimming to New York City. Eventually though, the passengers and crew are rescued by nearby boats. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident haunts, and he experiences a dream in which the plane crashes into a building. Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) suggest that the left engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. Furthermore, the National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerised simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport without engines. Sully, however, insists that both engines were lost, leaving him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport. Sully realises that the Board believes the accident may have pilot error, which would end his career. The simulations are rerun with live pilots and seen at the public hearing, both resulting in successful landings each either airport. Sully argues however that these simulations are unrealistic as the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face, the emergency action and practises the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run emergency checks before deciding to divert the plane. Both simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time with a 35-second delay before the plane is diverted. The LaGuardia simulation ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and Teterboro simulation ends with the plane crashing into buildings before the airport. The board then hear the voices of Sullenburger and Skiles when making the emergency announcements. Later, analysis reveals that the port engine, recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best option available to him, which saved the lives of everyone aboard. Also starring Laura Linney as Lorrie Sullenberger, Mike O'Malley as Charles Porter, Breaking Bad's Anna Gunn as Elizabeth Davis, True Blood's Chris Bauer as Larry Rooney, Ann Cusack (John's sister) as Donna Dent, and Sam Huntington as Jeff Kolodjay. Hanks gives an interesting, composed performance as mostly calm ordinary man who made a remarkable decision, I agree that this is a somewhat understated way to portray this story, but we all know it is a disaster with a happy ending. The film goes backwards and forwards in time to tell the story, which is a little distracting, the crash and rescue scenes are well done, and the board hearing does get your attention, everything else in between is alright, overall, it is a worthwhile biographical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing. Good!"
" Represents the FAA as accurately as Ghostbusters represents the EPA
",0.0,-0.8074,2021-01-24 00:00:00,2,"Unfortunately, the tale of the Hudson landing wasn't enough for a film apparently; so they manufactured a story about obviously incompetent investigators trying to take down a hero. The real elements of this story lend credibility to this fiction. If you can tell they're talking nonsense when you've never been in the cockpit, it's not because the story is well told; it's because it's made up to give you a villain. At least no one thinks the EPA actually released a flood of ghosts on NewYork City in the 80s."
" Flawless execution
",0.5106,0.6365,2020-12-29 00:00:00,9,"Being an aviation enthusiast I might be slightly biased, but this movie is just incredible. Plenty of spine tickling moments that make you feel like a passenger on a tremendous flight as the crew shout ""heads down, stay down"". The work done by the director, actors and everything else around them is incredible.Cockpit scenes and realism is on a level not seen before. Masterful story telling backed by gripping camera work, acting and music.Slightly dull in-between fillers using back stories which tend to be a notch boring. They still add value to the screenplay, but takes one star away from being truly flawless.Have watched it multiple times now and will likely watch a few more times."
" Great in many ways, but grotesquely slimes the NTSB
",0.3716,-0.1036,2020-11-09 00:00:00,5,"Great acting, but the sliming of the NTSB is really unconscionable.The NTSB simply doesn't work in the villainous manner depicted. This depiction is nonsense on its face. I'm not naïve, and well aware that Federal authorities are not angels. You should be wary of their motives and conclusions.But as a simple matter of fact, the NTSB does not throw around accusations in the days following an accident. They WILL ask questions like ""why didn't you return to La Guardia"" because that's a valid question that needs a direct answer, and that direct answer is ""I didn't believe we could make it."" There's noting accusatory about the question itself, and you're not staring down Skylar White.It's just unfortunate they went there. There is quite ample drama in the actual event. And the ATC scenes are played so well, it creates an amazing amount of suspense despite knowing the outcome."
" Terrifically detailed work directed by a living legend, and starring one too!
",0.4574,0.9973,2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"This is based on a true incident from a few years ago, where a veteran pilot actually was able to land his plane in the Hudson river in NYC and with all on board surviving. It is a terrifically detailed but slow moving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring the Jimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been three time -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (You were robbed of the statuette in 2000 for ""Cast Away"", Tom. Who else could play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning ""Mystic River"" in that he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he does here as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forth between the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whether the pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of the nearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the first third of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big event twice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and of itself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. How nice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as the passenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent, sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is and was also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light and as a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays a somewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she gets Valerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simple heroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescue the passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of many of the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo would say, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and got a big laugh! Highly recommended."
" Better for a action movie than a biopic
",0.4404,0.5106,2020-09-24 00:00:00,7,"While the movie does an excellent job portraying the planes ditch into the Hudson, that seems to be the only good part of it. 9/10 if it was a fictional movie, but it doesn't seem realistic."
" Extraordinary Event Doesn't Translate to Extraordinary Film
",0.0,-0.459,2020-09-22 00:00:00,6,"Whilst an interesting event, with a top cast, and visually very impressive, as a film this just wasn't that great. There is no real storyline, no climax, just the replaying of what was (admittedly) an extraordinary event. Although you can't say the film drags, it doesn't go anywhere either, and it can be dull instead of gripping to see something only possible to perform without human emotion. The whole thing is really topped off with the smack of US propoganda at the end when you learn the numbers behind 'New York's Finest' etc., where all involved with the film essentially pat themselves on the back for their patriotism."
" Good Film - Poor Audio
",-0.0516,-0.4728,2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"In view of Clint Eastwood producing and directing, I can't understand why this film was so audibly poor.
There were long passages where I just could not understand what was being said. The boarding of passengers on the plane, the cockpit dialogue and worst of all the jet fighter scene.
It detracted from an interesting and otherwise well made drama."
" Sully
",0.0,-0.036,2020-09-20 00:00:00,5,"The real life Sully show heroism and professionalism in 2009. He was the airline captain who landed his plane on New York's Hudson river after geese flew into both his engines. All the passengers survived.Bars named a drink after Sully. Grey Goose with a splash of water.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the focus of the movie is on the aftermath. Whether Sully (Tom Hanks) needed to dive into the river or could he had somehow got to an airstrip.There is a solid performance from Tom Hanks as Sully, who suffers from some form of PTSD after the incident.Eastwood's direction is efficient but the story is plodding with a lot of underwritten characters and wasted actors. The clue is the short running time with a threat that had to be manufactured regarding the post crash investigation.It ends up like Microsoft Flight Simulator as you watch certain scenarios as to whether the flight could had made it back to the airport.Aaron Eckhart who plays the co pilot Jeff Skiles keeps things a little lighthearted starting with his moustache."
" ""Chesley Sullenberger""- The unsung hero of US Airways Flight 1549
",0.5574,-0.935,2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"The movie Sully is based on a true story which was in The New York Time as Miracle of the Hudson. It is a 2016 American biographical drama directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Todd Komarnicki, based on the autobiography"" Highest Duty by Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow"". The film stars Tom Hanks as Sullen berger, with Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, Jamey Sheridan, and Jerry Ferrara in supporting roles. The film follows Sullenberger's January 2009 emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, in which all 155 passengers and crew members survived the plane crash. A feat largely credited to captain Sullen Berger. On 15th January, US airways flight no.1549 departed from LaGuardia airport. Barely 3 minutes into the flight, disaster struck. A flock of birds flew in to the engines; which cripples both of the engines and raised an emergency situation for the pilot. Although there were no airport in range Sully still maintained the aircraft and saw if they could make it on airport otherwise they would crash. Sully decided that the plane won't make it to the airport so he choose to land on the Hudson river which was nearby. Finally he successfully landed the aircraft with minimal damage; sparing the lives of the crew and passengers. It was the first-time in history that a plane landed on water without any casualties. However, the official investigation reports that one of the engines was running ideal and not damage yet. The flight simulations indicated that it would have been possible to land at either of LaGuardia or Teterboro airports. This charge caused Sully being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill. Sullys life was being invaded by reporters and investigators forced sully to put his job and reputation on the line. Sully was almost charged guilty of endangering the lives of his passengers and crew as the human flight simulations showed that it was possible to land the aircraft safely on any of the two airports. But then Sully asked jury how many times did the simulation pilots practice the turn and landing to make the landing precise and also added that they were not in the real life and death situation that he had to face. Then the jury took his opinion in concern and found out that the simulation pilots had to practice 17 times to make the turn, and so they gave the pilots and 30 second handicap then both of the landing attempts failed in disasters. And afterwards they received a report on the recently recovered left engine and it said that the left engine was severely damaged. After seeing this the jury was convinced that what sully did was inevitable and a miracle. So, all the allegations on sully were taken down and Sully was finally recognized as the hero that he was."
" Genius and Self Control
",0.0,0.9989,2020-09-10 00:00:00,9,"The success of genius has as much to do with context as it has to do with anything else. What Thomas Edison said about perspiration and inspiration still goes. When it works to insure and promote the safety and well-being of others it is often displayed at its best. The film story of SULLY (2016), directed by Clint Eastwood, with Tom Hanks playing the titular role, is an example of this.Genius represented in professionalism is a subject treated in film not nearly enough. I think men particularly value and treasure the ability to do the right thing at the right time under stress. You may recall that Hemingway was often quoted as calling it grace under pressure. Yes, even a Novelist and Big Game Hunter has been known to run into it from time to time. The ability to think sanely and intelligently in extraordinary circumstances is an essential component of real life heroism and the bedrock of most success stories. It can take the exercise of self control tempered and refined and qualified with training and practice to exercise this quality.There is nothing like encountering an emergency situation and feeling duly prepared to confront and handle it. Reading about John Glenn in Thomas Wolfe's THE RIGHT STUFF and remembering the homey way he shared his adventure in orbit with all of us on Earth while handling the forces of velocity and a loose heat shield readily comes to mind. But facing danger to advance human knowledge isn't quite the same kettle of fish as saving the bacon for 155 souls. It was wonderful to see a trained professional save lives with his expertise and be able to utter with or without shrugging that he was just doing his job.Real life isn't the movies, but then, you already knew that. The truth is genius and heroism are far more commonplace than might be imagined, but in this Brave New World of Public Relations and Spin and Superheroes, we tend to focus more on the showy and glamorous aspects of it, rather than presenting it in all its work-a-day details. Parents who raise their children to continually rise above their flaws and imperfections to successfully face life are heroes. Artists and Scientists and Inventors who hold fast to the values of their visions and dreams of universes teeming with joy in creation and in life are heroes, too. But then there are your everyday heroes like the quick-witted Crosstown Bus Driver, who closes the back door on a gang member seconds after he has snatched a woman's purse out of her lap and runs down the aisle to hop out of the exit, driving off while the rest of the gang at the curb explode the windows with rocks and jagged pieces of concrete.I would venture to guess Chesley Sullenberger is not much different from this colored Bus Driver. He trained to do a job and he did it. He was prepared to do the right thing no matter what circumstances dictated. This reminds me of what one of the Black Belts said when he was quoting our Master Instructor Sang Kyu Shim in Tae Kwon Do class. ""When preparation is complete, execution is guaranteed.""We could all hazard to understand this a little better. This particular case might be an excellent example to study.Naturally, I am waxing rhapsodic about this because of the workmanlike job Clint Eastwood accomplished in bringing the story of Chesley Sullenberger to Life. I have read that we live in a world of Public Relationships, but I believe this world will fast give way to the movement towards an era of TECHNOLOGICAL CLASSISM where we become less concerned with the beauty of appearances and more concerned with the beauty of how things work. I personally think Clint Eastwood's SULLY is a valuable contribution to this movement. It even makes me want to go and learn to drill how to break down my bike better in case I should ever have a flat.Tom Hanks was never more the Every Man Hero than in this movie. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Styles and Laura Linney as Lorraine Sullenburger, along with the rest of the supporting characters, handle their roles with realism and restraint. But this has been an Eastwood hallmark for awhile now.A lot of us remember Eastwood from the early days, when he played Rowdy Yates on RAWHIDE, and the Wagon Master would have to go into town to get him out of jail or his latest trouble. We were rooting for him when he went to Italy to do those THE MAN WITH NO NAME Spaghetti Westerns to cultivate a screen persona he could grow and evolve. As the years went on, I marveled at how he had broken out of the pack of the television leading men of the fifties and sixies; guys like Ty Hardin, Adam West, Clint Walker, Steve McQueen, even James Garner, to became an acclaimed director and filmmaker in his own right. Since making his directorial debut with PLAY MISTY FOR ME (1971), it seems to me he has never looked back.The script, written by Todd Komarnicki, is technically meticulous and tightly crafted. I would quibble that more of a back story in flashbacks for a handful of the passengers might have been better for the authenticity of the narrative. This, rather than focusing on the drama with the National Transportation Safety Board, a portion of which, from all accounts, is somewhat contrived. But there is no denying that Eastwood and crew have captured what it is like for a working man to answer the call of his Highest Duty."

Real Captain Sully hats off to you!!!"
" Hanks at his best
",0.6369,-0.9006,2020-08-22 00:00:00,9,"One of, if not the best, performance ever by Tom Hanks . He is Chesley Sullenberger, not just Tom Hanks skillfully playing a role. The recreation of the events and other ""what if"" scenarios is spectacular, almost as if they had been filmed when the event was actually happening. (It's a shame the DVD has no additional special features explaining how this was done.) The movie could have taken a more traditional approach, such as following more personal stories of passengers and rescuers from the moment they left their homes to the moment they got off or to the plane. Instead - and equally entertaining and enthralling -- the focus in on the behind-the-scenes examination of whether a public hero actually deserves the accolades he has so instantly received. Such a government agency review is standard procedure, of course, but it seems especially cruel for Sullenberger to have to go through what appeared to be a hunt to find a way to blame the emergency landing on him. In the end, everyone was just ""doing their jobs"" and no hard feelings remained, one would hope."

" Strong Tom Hanks performance in a structurally irritating film
",0.0772,0.972,2020-08-04 00:00:00,5,"There will be no discounting of the true story and skills of the heroes involved in this investigation. What these pilots did was truly remarkable and should be remembered in the most honorable of terms. That being said, Clint Eastwood's film is a bit of a mess.Firstly, there is very little story to tell to span the running length. There are moments so stretched out it is unbearable to watch. A couple of subplots with passengers from the Hudson River flight are popped in to ground some form of reality to the people involved. While on paper this sounds fine, in execution there is a really phoniness to the whole proceedings. The crash incident itself is very tense yes, but for some reason we are subjected to it a couple of times over the film when this could have been skipped over and feels like it was purely done to stretch the film.The depiction of the National Transportation Safety Board is hilariously bad and sort of disrespectful to the real people involved. A painful attempt at creating a villain presence for a film that could have easily done without to purely focus on the heroic efforts of Sully and his co-pilot.That being said, the crash scene is very well done ignoring some bad CGI moments. Tom Hanks is also very very good and gives a real warmth to the cold direction of Eastwood (at least in this film). His speech defending himself is by far the best scene in the film and makes me want to see a film that was engaging and well written as that scene."

",0.4404,-0.7782,2020-06-17 00:00:00,7,"The film works in representing the post-traumatic stress experienced by Sully, with his insomnia and regular flashbacks of 'what might have happened) The final NTSB hearing scenes are also well-done and suitably gripping: particularly for viewers outside of the UK where we wouldn't have heard the outcome of the affair once the news cycle had moved on from the 'gee- whizz' headline event.Where the film aquaplanes somewhat is in the padding achieved through multiple scenes of New Yorkers back-slapping Sully. Some of this is needed to establish the pedestal that Sully is set upon: the bar scene, for example, is well done. But all the rest of the references become just plain tiresome.There is also a back-story focused on Sully's financial problems and rather scratchy marriage (as portrayed) to Lorraine (Laura Linney). Linney is normally a highly-watchable actress, but here her character is just so irritating that the mood of the film plummets every time she reappears on screen."

I had to know the story behind the headlines and knew the combo of Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks would not disappoint. It was very interesting to see the actual drama played out in detail which included the main characters and also some of the passengers. Heartening to know there are great aircraft pilots out there with the experience to adequately handle the unexpected. In an unpredictable world, that's a great comfort."

I don't know the exact odds of landing a commercial plane on water intact with no losses, but as the event is actually called ""Miracle on the Hudson"" I can assume they are close to none.I really like the film adaptations of incredible stories that happened and were overlooked by people not affected by them. This makes me feel happy and shows that miracles do exist. However, too many times creators changed too many things or just stomped real facts in favor of action or more tension. This movie hasn't totally escaped the curse of selling the more compelling plot. Some characters were shown quite different than they were when the events actually occurred, and it was indeed looking weird in the movie.Despite of a chase for more attractiveness of the character (which I find very useless, as the crew of the flight 1549 were already heroes in my eyes), the style of the delivery is incredible. The back and forth of the events is used perfectly to show both the emotions of the pilots that performed an act of true professionalism and the above-mentioned doing itself.The modern technology allows you to experience that life threatening moment and can say that Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart totally impressed me with the performance making me appreciate the skill of the pilots even more.Overall, Clint Eastwood has made a very good example of the movie that tells a real life story. I would say that the genre is moving in the right direction. Now I would like to compare it to the book of Chesley Sullenberger."

It's a great real life story, I just wished they hadn't fixed the story to something that really didn't happen, which was the treatment of Sully by the airlines. That was added for dramatic purposes and not needed. Also it was a bit repetitive. They didn't need to show the crash 4 or more times. Once would have been enough and they should have focused more on the relationships, especially the Sully and his wife which was reduced to phone calls. And Jeff and Sully, they should have added how they met and didn't know each other.Also, the ending meeting was too much Hollywood drama and some bad acting/direction. They spent too little time on the passengers/flight attendants. A few moments here and there isn't enough to care for them.Having said that it's worth the watch."

But after such an incident, there is always an investigation. Although the Captain would have been very familiar with the protocols, after what he went through, questions about his personal life and the need for a urine sample must have seemed intrusive, at the very least.
Great feel good film. I love that the real ferry captain played himself, and the real scuba police were also represented.

",0.5106,-0.502,2019-10-25 00:00:00,7,"This wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, kind of dry actually. Clint Eastwood directed this bio pic about airline pilot Sully Sullenberger depicting his successful emergency landing of a disabled airbus on the Hudson river in Jan. 2009 .In the aftermath, that takes up most of the movie Sully must endure sudden, unwanted fame and the FCC trying to prove fault with his decision even though he saved everyone on board. Insurance companies right?! The viewer spends a lot of time following the inquest and watching what if scenarios on flight simulators. Tom Hanks is fantastic throughout, there's a good back up cast with Aaron Eckhart as the copilot and Laura Linney but after the actual landing the rest of the movie was dry, a bit jumpy and even repetitive."
" Just another amazing movie by Hanks

It is a simple telling of the tale which allows the extraordinary nature of what happened to stand on its own. Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and his crew show just how extraordinary people can be when placed in an unpredictable situations. Seeing this story unfold, the bravery of those involved and the initially shocking way in which Sully and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles were treated by the accident investigators is sobering and genuinely moving. The fact that one mans split-second decision based on years of experience meant that every single passenger and crew member survived is remarkable. I think few actors other than Tom Hanks could have put in such a beautifully observed and assured performance in the lead role, he is genuinely moving in this role. This is a proper ""feel-good"" movie that is unsentimental and genuinely worth watching."

" The script is overcooked but wonderfully understated film otherwise
",0.7469,-0.2432,2019-08-25 00:00:00,8,"The script's treatment of the aviation safety board is a significant problem in the film. For whatever reason the writer decided to play up the antagonistic angle; this cast the review committee as hostile. This is not supported the historical record. More the point this sort of tension building is unneeded. The script adds a mystery and validation element that the story simply could have done without. I am sure Eastwood's libertarian sensibilities played a role in this poor decisions. Eastwood tends to distrust big structures and sympathize with the every man on the ground.Sully, the character especially as played by Hanks, is the quintessential Eastwood hero. He has an independent mind, an expert, is calm ,collected. He shows emotional only when he is alone and the danger is resolved. The film is at its best when it is dealing with the aftermath of the crash and how it effects the mental state of Sully. It is rare to have a director, an actor and a character so in sync but while everyone involved had finer moments this film just fits all involved.Good late Eastwood"

Hanks, and all supporting actors are sublime throughout. Understated at times I guess, but for good reason.It's just great stoytelling with the right balance of fact and artistic licence to be visceral and enthralling all at once, I guess (could be very factual for all I know but it's very entertaining!)For me, it is what filmmaking should be more often. I guess for some too slow. Sometimes, an enthralling historic event unfolding at a pace that makes you salivate is almost as good as it gets.Great cinematography, scirpt, acting and storyline.

The flight attendants are portrayed properly as professionals, not as I must say is done in some air disaster movies, terrified and panicky! Dramatic licence is probably necessary even in a movie with this subject but you can't really tell! One slight criticism if you don't mind.

The theme even projects throughout the movie as characters consistently remark on the rarity of ""good news"" stories that have real heroic action involved in this day. Hanks brilliant ability at portraying self reflection as he has so often pulled off in titles like Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan is well presented here.The fact the movie may contain a number of continuity errors, for example Captain Sullenbergers dry pants moments after being waste deep in water are superfluous to the gorgeous story unfolding of a self doubting hero who after all is said and done wants to simply be known for ""doing my job"".Regardless of the motivations of the FAA and Corporate Airline entities involved and how they are portrayed we can all relate to a thematic relevance of an individual under mental siege, being questioned and ultimately pushed with intentions toward making the individual the patsy for the systemic failure of a large organization. The understanding that even the best of pilots cannot see birds from a great distance and in time to react or maneuver a large cumbersome airliner on a dime is well displayed and enacted by Eastwood and Hanks.The final analysis being that veteran experience in decision making saved the lives of 252 individuals and prevented what would have most certainly been one of the worst catastrophes in aviation history.Everyone should watch this movie."

This is a Clint Eastwood movie in which Eastwood seems on autopilot and largely disinterested in the material; there's none of the heart of LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA here. Tom Hanks does his usual nice-serious-authoritative role as the hero of the hour, making the best of it as only he can; the film's fragmented narrative doesn't work all that well, and the use of dream sequences and the like is a bit of a cheat.

My uncle worked for the NTSB and was flown out to NYC the day after to work the case. Most of whats in the movie about the investigation is completely made up. If you read the transcripts of the interviews and panel its technical boring and frankly deferential to the pilots because by then they were international heroes. And it took nearly a year to complete. If you take that and the made up dream sequences out its probably a fairly boring movie because no one died. People came together to work a problem and no one was the bad guy except some geese. Its a feel good movie well acted by Hanks. I wish they had gone more into his background especially all the years of military flying he did and the fact he was working trying to start a saftery company before the accident. The right man at the right time and that should be good enough

" An Invigoratingly Compelling Pre and Post Jet Landing Experience
",0.5994,0.9233,2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,9 September 2016. Director Clint Eastwood has created a compelling and refreshing look at both the mental and the physical experience of a national event of an aborted passenger jetliner takeoff and its aftermath occurring in one of the most populated place on earth. Both the director's incorporation of humanly personal touches and some wonderfully new camera shot perspectives reveal an exciting movie-going experience this heroic incident that is inspiration in its entirety.The editing and use of flashbacks to maintain the pacing and captivating questions move the storyline along at a wonderful pace. This is one of those movies where the director's keen talent is required to finesse and flesh out a written recollection by the heroic pilot himself onto the big screen. The small shots of the secondary but just as important humans involved in the rescue and personally touched by this major bird hit informs the public of a community coming together and the teamwork involved in saving the lives of both passengers and crew.Clint Eastwood offers up this singular event as in important redemptive experience of Americans in light of the tragedy and turmoil that took place in this country in the early part of the last decade of the 21st Century. This movie is a great follow up to Ralph Nelson's 1964 fictional airliner investigation thriller Fate is the Hunter or the more haunting supernatural thriller of Rodrigo Garcia's Passengers (2008) and complements the television series Air Disasters (2011) with a fuller personalized background story.
" A story stuck in a holding pattern

It circles around the same plot points with no real sense of progress until the end. Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Aaron Eckhart's mustache and the rest of the supporting cast all give strong performances, though, and the scenes with the crash are pretty powerful.

" Incredible look at a hero's moment of valor.
",0.0,0.93,2018-12-24 00:00:00,7,"By now everyone reading this review would be somewhat aware of the Miracle on the Hudson. This film is based on the hero of that incident- the Captain Sullenberg. Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks and careful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. The audience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant target of the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in the aftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film is that the supporting characters did not have much to work with.

His internal conflict of doubting his desicion making, is one that everyone can relate to in some way, making the viewer immediately sympathize with him. The conflict has been portrait in a believable way. While watching the viewer can slowly make their own decision on whether they think Sully made the best decision, while never accusing him of having made the wrong one.It is unfortunate that they made it abundantly clear in the end that Sully did in fact make the best decision. It would have been a lot stronger to make that less evident, making the viewer realize that it does not matter wheither Sully made best decision, because he made the right one at that the right moment."

" A Real Crash and Burn of a Film
",-0.4019,0.983,2018-11-10 00:00:00,3,"I paid $6.50 to watch ""Sully"" in a theater on this drizzly day, and think I would have been better off spending nothing and standing out in the drizzle instead.Sully came highly recommended, and most of the people in the theater seemed to enjoy it, but I found the simplified storyline unnecessarily manipulative and boring. Sully is a typical Clint Eastwood directed blockbuster that pits a purely heroic pilot (Tom Hanks) against the completely villainous investigators of the NTSB. Eastwood has again shown himself incapable of nuance, and unable to tell a story without lazily resorting to a binary narrative of absolute good and evil. Maybe American audiences crave simplistic black and white stories (as indicated by the box-office success of Sully), but I'd rather spend my time with complex stories and characters, even if the grand narrative is one of hero vs. villain.I'm certain there is a good tale to be told about the ditching of the USAir flight. In this case it looks like Tom Hanks did the best he could with a weak script, but Mr. Eastwood's directing made sure that Sully wouldn't rise above the level of a made for TV Movie of the Week. Sully is simply not worthy of the big screen, or $6.50."
" Flying at its best
",0.6369,0.977,2018-10-22 00:00:00,10,"There's no other movie than Sully that depicts the demonstration of perfect flying skills in what appears to be and would otherwise be a hopeless emergency situation. Not only thanks to the very realistic and accurate re-enactment of this true story by the superb Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, but also and more importantly because it is simply amazing to see how the pilots pull off the impossible in just over 200 seconds.
Having taken myself private pilot lessons on a single engine Cessna in my student years 40 years ago practicing different inflight emergency situations, one key rule engraved from the beginning is NOT to attempt to return to the same (single) runway when engine failure just after take off. The temptation is there to turn around but the procedure taught by the instructor was to quickly (in seconds) pick the best place for an emergency landing in the immediate vicinity and plan and execute your one-shot approach.
Now with a twin-jet engine airliner and a single engine loss, there's sufficient thrust from the second engine and time to turn around and land safely. With both engines stopped as in Sully's case, it's like the single engine Cessna rule. No time for ""guessing"" or ""experimenting"". The incredible pilot skill is deciding where to land, gliding, steering and landing this large aircraft on water so smoothly that it did not roll, flip and break apart, saving everyone aboard. That is the beauty of this movie, seeing how it's done, the perfect reactions and actions by the experienced pilot and copilot in every detail. The realistic cinematography and sound experience augment this movie, directed by the great Clint Eastwood. Watched it several times already and still am mesmerized by it."

If anyone at all can tell a story it's Clint Eastwood and if anyone at all can live it....it's Tom Hanks. I also have to give Aaron Eckhart a solid A for his supportive role. I remember the day this historic event happened, but in no way did I or anyone I know, have any comprehension or understanding as to the length of rigorous interrogation that Captain Sully really truly had. There was definitely more at stake than what met the eye, and it was Captain Sully's heroic decision that was the fine line between the survival of 155 souls and losing 155 souls. Just incredible."

And there is one story which most of us recognize and / or remembers, including myself. Yes, this movie tells the very same story. About the emergency landing on freezing water with almost full passenger plane.When I first saw this movie, I was like ""Oh wow, there is actual movie out of it. It must be great."" And then I looked cast ""Oh my GOD, and my absolute favorite character (Tom Hanks) on the main role! Now I MUST watch it!""
And yeah I did that.It turned out to be pretty different than I expected. I was expecting more catastrophe film like The Perfect Storm"" or Titanic or something like that.
To be honest, I didn't like those ""hallucinations"" and different memories that pilot saw.
It's kind of weird that it shows the accident by piece by piece. But however, I understand it because this story was more on the pilot's side. I mean the investigation that focused on human errors. And it was great to see how they managed to fight back.
And here, Tom Hanks really nails it again. Just gotta love every role he acts. He just is excellent actor, no matter what role.In the end, movie still turned to be very great, although I didn't get quite what I expected."

" After A Slow Start This Becomes A Superb Story
",0.6249,0.9949,2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"I thought ""Sully"" got off to a bit of a slow start. I remember the incident well from news reports - Captain Sullenberger landing the massive Airbus A320 in the Hudson River just a few minutes after takeoff because of dual engine failures - and everyone surviving the incident. It sounds like an exciting story, but it's made pretty clear from the start that this is going to be far more about the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board than about the incident itself. Which, I suppose, is understandable. As is pointed out several times in the movie, the entire incident lasted about 208 seconds. You can't really make a movie about a 208 second incident. And, indeed, for the first little while this movie had me a bit disoriented, wondering what really was going on. But the story picks up its pace well, and in the end director Clint Eastwood did a magnificent job of moving back and forth from the narrative about the investigation to what actually happened in the cockpit - and the cockpit scenes were dramatic and seemingly (to me, admittedly a non-pilot) meticulously recreated - as was the ultimate evacuation of the plane afterward. It really was a tribute not just to Sully, but to all of the flight crew, who acted professionally and calmly and ensured the survival of their passengers.The NTSB didn't come across quite as well. Sullenberger became (understandably) a hero almost from the moment this happened. After all, it happened in broad daylight in one of the world's largest cities - lots of people saw it. The depiction of the NTSB investigators was that they were antagonistic toward Sully, perhaps either disturbed or jealous that his media acclaim was getting way ahead of their work, and they came across as people looking to place blame for the incident rather than people who were looking for the truth. The actual investigators disputed how they were portrayed, and my understanding is that even Sullenberger disagreed with the liberties that the writers and Eastwood took with this part of the story. I suppose there was a feeling that a movie has to have a ""bad guy"" to create dramatic tension - and the NTSB filled that role perfectly, even if the portrayal was unfair.Tom Hanks is obviously the star of this movie. Aaron Eckhart is along for the ride as Scully's co-pilot, Jeff Skiles, but everything in this movie focuses on Hanks. His performance, I thought, was predictably excellent. It's an understated performance - not high on typical drama or excitement, but portraying Sully as a naturally humble man who finds himself thrust into the spotlight and tormented by the thought that he could have done something different - something safer - although it's made clear that for all his thoughts about alternatives in the end he's confident that he made the right decision - the evidence for that being that all 155 people on the plane survived.Ultimately, after that slow start that lasted for maybe 15 or 20 minutes when the movie seemed a bit off focus, this turned out to be an excellent story of a man who is, indeed, a real hero.

" Good Character Study, Lacking in Facts
",0.4404,-0.8173,2018-07-09 00:00:00,7,"The movie is enjoyable to watch and gives a good impression of what must go on inside the mind of a pilot after such a spectacular accident. The depiction of the actual ditching (landing in the water) and the conversation between the pilots and controllers is quite accurate, and with CGI, quite believable.However, the depiction of the investigative process, including the behavior of the investigators, is not realistic at all. I have worked as a professional pilot and air accident investigator for most of my life, and the investigation as depicted in this film is pure fiction.In several interviews with the director, Clint Eastwood, he admitted that the movie needed a villain or antagonist, so he chose to depict the investigators and the investigative process as much more hostile than it really is."
" Likable film about an admirable man, but the material was better suited for a documentary...
",0.7311,0.9932,2018-06-24 00:00:00,7,"""On January 15, 2009. More than 1.200 first responders and 7 ferry boats carrying 130 commuters rescued the passengers and crew of flight 1349. The best of New York came together. It took them 24 minutes""Surely an inspiring conclusion, but I admit my immediate reaction was ""who are you kidding?"". I'm not cynically negating the fact that the 155 passengers of the fateful flight were rescued by competent and dedicated New Yorkers, but it's Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger aka Sully who definitely saved them. And that's why he's got the lion-share of praises, that's why he got the film.I worked in an airline company for more than three years, this film is about January 15, 2009 but I mostly remember June 1 of the same year. It was the day I started working and when -in a tragic irony- the Airbus flight from Rio to Paris crashed. My immersion into the flight world coincided with that event and for some metaphysical reason, I read every single article about that crash, which -according to the investigation- was tragic because avoidable. Basically, if it wasn't for the pilot letting the co-pilot in command, for the co-pilot taking the wrong indications, for several ""if"" factors, two hundreds of people wouldn't have perished in one of Airbus' deadliest accidents.But ""Sully"" made me relativize all these computer-generated inquiries that end up pointing a posthumous accusation against the pilots. Indeed, it doesn't take a NTSB expert to know that accidents are the result of equations featuring many parameters among them human factor, there's never one sole cause of accident. This is why planes are still statistically the safest travelling ways, and this is why it doesn't say much about how stressful a flight plane is. This is why, on a personal note, I think my last hour is coming whenever turbulences start. This is why I take my chances with buses, boats and cars. Hell, this is why people still applaud the pilot when he lands.Why should they? Isn't it part of their job? In the short documentary-feature about Sully, he reminds us that pilots have to fly well every time, it's a job that doesn't allow one hazardous move or uncertainty. I worked in the freight business where everything was processed and pre-planned from A to Z, freight isn't living people, but lives are always at stakes during a flight. That's why pilot is an ace job, when you have hundreds of lives depending on you every day, you can't afford a mistake... but as Sully also says this time in the film ""everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time"".Clint Eastwood shows us a man confronted to such situation with only 208 seconds to react. In what should have been a routine flight, birds are sucked into the two engines making both unusable, and the only solution is an emergency landing on the closest runway. The altitude is low, he can't reach an airport without flying over New York City and he's got less than a minute to make up his mind. Of course, there's not much suspense since we know he made the right choice by landing on the Hudson river. But suspense isn't Eastwood's concern, he doesn't care about the 208 seconds but the 24 minutes.Indeed, after his ""Invictus"" and ""American Sniper"" and before the ""15:17 to Paris"" Eastwood seemed to have grown a cinematic fondness on real-life heroes. I guess it's a generational appreciation of men who were capable of taking the right decision at the right time and inspire the best out of the people. Mandela in ""Invictus"" took unpopular decisions that eventually united South-Africans. Chris Kyle might have been blinded by his patriotism but became an inspiration to his companions. Sully is made in the same Eastwoodian vein, he wouldn't call himself a hero, but don't ever tell him he made the wrong decision.The problem with ""Sully"" though is that the film takes a situation of a few minutes and needlessly stretches it for the sake of cinematic viability. In a non-linear narrative, it switches back and forth between moments where he's hailed as a hero and where he's criticized by the NTSBC investigation. Moments where he seems to go through a PTSD phase and moments where he reminisces about his past. The investigation is perhaps the best part of the film and it makes everything else feel as ""fillers"", Laura Linney is not being given the most grateful role of her career as the long-suffering wife and the film could have done without Katie Couric calling Sully a fraud in an imagination sequence. Why would he be a fraud if he never pretended to be a hero?The not-so subtle point of Eastwood is betrayed by that ""best of New York"" disclaimer. The film opens with a nightmarish vision of ""what could have been"" had Sully followed the instructions by the book instead of his precious instinct and it ends with a needlessly graphic recreation of September 11. Maybe the opening and ending elevate Sully as a heroic figure because he could inspire the best of New York like the terrorist attacks did, but by saving lives instead. An Egyptian taxi driver praises him for having restored his faith in humanity in a year that started with the crisis, Madoff and Middle-East wars. It wasn't just the perfect timing but the perfect time.Now, I enjoy a good inspirational film like anyone but I can't say the film captivated me as ""Invictus"" did or elicited a reaction as strong as ""American Sniper"" (even though it was a negative one). The film struck me as a poor man's ""Apollo 13"" or a film Steven Spielberg could have made between two blockbusters. I liked it for its informative value but I enjoyed the real smiling Sully more than Hanks' grim all-serious performance... so maybe the story was better suited for a documentary?"
" Captain Sully
",0.0,0.9977,2018-06-12 00:00:00,7,"January 15, 2009. Many remember the date for the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" Crew and passengers totaled 155 as birds flew into the engine of the plane, forcing the captain to land in the Hudson River. Heralded as a hero, people who haven't read the book (including myself) that Chesley Sullenberger proceeded to write about the incident may not be familiar with everything that happened after the memorable day.There's different ways of approaching the material, so let's see how they decided to do it before analyzing the contributions of the individual. The beginning sets up how Sully never embraces the role of a hero and how his mind is tormented about how he saved the lives of everyone, yet the flight committee pushes to know if it was the best and safest decision; Sully reported that he lost both engines and thus wouldn't have thrust to return to a runway, but simulations and data engineers put together state otherwise. The beginning also sets up how Sully has always had a passion to fly and is an experienced pilot with over 40 years under his belt.It isn't until about the 30 minute mark that we get our first glimpses of the day in question. From then on there's a good deal of Sully contemplatively running through New York and reliving the day and the possible outcomes, and then different views of the 208 seconds of fateful flight.This is not the most thrilling movie. It just simply can't be. And it doesn't infuse the amount of enjoyment that Moneyball did with subject matter that could've bored audiences. Nevertheless, that is not to say the movie is boring. Clint Eastwood directs, and he more than anybody ever can direct with such a cool hand. And his directing when it comes to the rescue scenes on the river may be overlooked, but it's truly strong directing. And in typical Eastwood form, expect a lot of subtle piano playing in the film (Eastwood is credited with the theme for the film). It's also worth mentioning that even though many glimpses of the crash (or as Sully puts it, ""forced water landing"") are presented throughout the brisk hour and a half, it doesn't get old. There's purpose every time it's shown, and the right amount is shown every time.Tom Hanks stars as the captain who misses his family and truly believes he was just doing his job-- nothing overly heroic. There's some internal demons to battle over the course of the movie, and it may not be Hanks' finest performance, but the everyday-charm and subtleness is still quite a performance. Aaron Eckhart is the clear supporting role, second fiddle character. He's really meant to be the comic relief, and, not all the jokes are the most well-written, but again there's charm for the guy that has his captain's back every step of the way. Laura Linney is never on the screen with Hanks at the same time, but as the distressed wife, they share plenty of phone calls together.Again, this really isn't the most thrilling movie, and there shouldn't be hopes of it being one either. But it is a film shot almost entirely in IMAX cameras and the shots of New York are great; the acting is basically between good and great, and the final act shows the most humanity. Perhaps the film could be likened to Lincoln-- well acted without the most compelling of stories, but instead of Lincoln's ensemble cast, Sully places its bets on the focus of a few individual and that helps it retain the identity of an enjoyable film. It probably doesn't raise to the level needed for any Oscar nod, but it is an enjoyable film. And when you can enjoy a film or the film succeeds in the purpose it set out on, that's a win in my books.

I am a male and unashamed to say that the tissues are required ever time I watch this movie.Tom Hanks is just one of those actors who just is the best, add Clint Eastwood's direction and you have a really good movie to watch. All of the actors in this do a fantastic job.Highly recommended if you are feeling down or just want a lift."
" Strong Adaption
",0.5106,0.9861,2018-06-02 00:00:00,8,"'Sully' director Clint Eastwood strongly adapts the real-life story of an everyday hero. When adapting a true story to the big screen, there are a million and one things that could go wrong, but Clint Eastwood manages to avoid any major ones. In particular, Eastwood manages to make a plane crash incident that lasted only a few minutes long into a full length film that doesn't drag on and have unnecessary scenes. It is evident that the movie's focus is on the humanitarian aspect of the story, not the actual plane crash. In saying this, with the main focus being on the hero pilot Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, a good actor is needed, and Tom Hanks, hands down, knocks this role out of the park. He delivers a realistic and honest performance that brings the character alive and is one of the main reasons this movie is so good. The combination of Eastwood's solid directing and Hank's strong performance, 'Sully' ends being a great film that tells an inspiring story of a real human being."

It had really cool reenactments of the airplane crash both as sorrow for the passengers and as special effects recreating the crash. It also was very well paced. I would've liked to know Sully's family more and it didn't have an ending. It just stopped, but was mostly very entertaining."
" Good but padded
",0.2382,0.8835,2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"In January 2009, Captain Chesley Sullenbeger, aka Sully, successfully ditches a powerless jet airliner in the Hudson River, resulting in the full complement of 155 passengers and crew surviving. The event happens in full view of numerous cameras, and becomes known as Miracle On The Hudson: Sully is a hero. But the subsequent enquiry seeks to establish the landing as pilot error by proving that Sully could have successfully landed back at La Guardia.This dramatisation of real-life events is not unsuccessful, but is nonetheless a little odd.Director Clint Eastwood reconstructs the moment from the bird striking the jet engine to the ditching extremely well. The trouble is that, as in real-life, this took only a few minutes (it was less than half an hour until everyone was safely on boats), so we get to see it twice from start to finish, several more times in fragments, and from a variety of angles.And there is no suspense to it: we already know everyone survived.So the thrust of this movie is the enquiry. Popular opinion has, to his embarrassment, labelled the self-effacing Sully as a hero, whereas the enquiry seeks to blame him for endangering lives, which will end his career.There is actually some decent drama here: one, I didn't know how the enquiry had gone so, for me, the outcome was in doubt and, two, the public hearing at the conclusion of the enquiry is an excellent bit of theatre.Tom Hanks is, as usual, a class act, especially playing an ordinary man displaying extraordinary qualities, but Aaron Eckhart as his co-pilot is as good. Laura Linney as Mrs Sullenberger is wasted, her role being simply to take part in distressed telephone calls.If there is a problem here it is that the only real drama is the hearing, and there is perhaps insufficient meat on those particular bones to sustain a feature without adding a fair amount of inconsequential padding.I'm still glad to have seen it, though."
" Fairytales do come true
",0.4215,0.9937,2018-04-15 00:00:00,6,"This true story is well known: plane crashes in river, everybody survives. Despite this miraculous succes the pilot Sully gets accused of reckless behaviour.No riveting actionscenes to be found in ""Sully"". No big drama's either. Director Clint Eastwood's movie is a slow burner, with good but not excellent acting. There are some touching emotional moments when everybody gets rescued and ofcourse it has got a feel good ending. All in all a warm nice movie depicting a fairytale of a true story.I must confess however, that I was constantly longing for the drama that ""Flight"" with Denzel Washington DID have, and ""Sully"" did NOT have. There could have been made a more intense and gripping movie about this wonderful story. Clint Eastwood played it too safe unfortunately. It certainly wont offend anyone, but it wont thrill either. It is just average feelgood stuff.Last detail worth mentioning is that in real life, pilot Sully revealed that a lot of pilots nowadays are in constant debt, while some of them even have to resort to foodstamps! When you fly what do YOU want? A rookie pilot with money problems or an experienced flightcaptain like Sully with a good salary? Flight companies are now testing planes WITHOUT any pilots at all. Bigger profits for sure. Better safety too?"

" Eastwood and Hanks are a great combo
",0.6249,0.9891,2018-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Based on the true story of the 2009 emergency airplane landing in New York's Hudson River: the events following the rescue include a hearing at the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) which claims that the plane might have landed safely at a nearby airport and avoided endangering those on board.""Sully"" was based on the book ""Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters"" by Chesley Sullenberger (aka Sully, the flight's captain) and Jeffrey Zaslow.The choice of narrative structure was wisely chosen. Instead of beginning with the main event itself, the film starts with the beginning of the NTSB hearings and later shows the emergency landing in flashback. This sets up an unexpected focus: instead of highlighting heroism, the film concentrates on the problems the event triggered and the inner turmoil of Sully himself.This movie works mainly because it is in the hands of two very able and trusted stalwarts: director Clint Eastwood and lead actor Tom Hanks. The simulation of the emergency landing is as thrilling as expected but there is just as much tension in the NTSB hearings. Here, the viewer is able to see the character behind someone (Sully) who can be extraordinary as he fights back but in a calm way; someone who thinks well and quickly; and also shows humility to acknowledge everyone's participation in the successful rescue rather than letting himself be singled out. Only someone with the depth and experience of Hanks could pull this off so well.The closing credits add a special bonus to this fine film. As it has already been mentioned: during that infamous decade, New Yorkers needed good news like this - especially news involving an airplane. - dbamateurcritic"
" A missed opportunity
",0.1531,-0.9391,2018-03-21 00:00:00,3,"There are many many inconsistencies all throughout the movie the most disturbing one is how the Airbus approaches the river on a level angle at 140mph. All you need is to have seen at least once in your life such a plane on a descent. The nose is pointed up specially during the stall that the pilot must have put the plane in to decrease its speed for touchdown. From the cockpit window no river would have been visible and that would have made it a much more poetic visual composition. It's just a deliberate mistake to increase the drama through ""epicness"" of landscape photography but since it's such a vital shot it ruined the whole movie for me.
The things that were of interest all fell flat: Sully's background as a fighter pilot, his relationship to a guy who flew that particular Airbus for the very first time, the geese and how they were subsequently hunted and annihilated, the deep shock of the traffic control agent that thought he had lost a plane (rather than that goofy, spaced out mess), there is just so much material in real life for this movie and yet somehow Todd Komarnicki just managed to keep it as dull and formulaic as possible. The editing is well done except for a terrible bar scene that lasted way too long and had a barkeeper making a joke about a splash of water?
To quote the movie: If not for Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood - take them away from the equation - this movie is really bad."

What could have been a long drawn-out movie with only 10 minutes of serious action becomes a masterpiece under the watchful eye of Director Clint Eastwood. Some of the biographical details may seem like filler, but it's nice to know a little bit about the man after all the hype about the hero. An attempt is made to discredit the magnificent deed of saving all 155 on board the aircraft, by the National Safety Board. Apparently, the movie ruffled a few feathers high up, as it was claimed that the inquest ""did not exactly happen that way"". Indeed! That's because it all had to be compressed into a mere 96 minutes. That's in far less time that even one board hearing, I am sure. Spellbinding. Great storytelling. I ""believed"" that I was aboard the aircraft. The re-enactment was superb. ""Not a movie for those with a fear of flying""-says The New York Times Review."

",0.3612,0.9799,2018-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Very well done film. This is probably the best recreation of an accident I have ever seen and with the best outcome. Plane accidents rarely end up well at all and recreating them would be a downer. Alive comes to mind but it was survival story after the crash and does not end up well for most of them. Sully is basically the story of what can happen when the best of them comes together and are in the right place to do so. A great occasion to be bright and heroic. In the dvd extras, they mention the contrast with the market crash and the greed normally prevalent in NY city, causing it. There are people that do not just want to get filthy rich quickly or screw up other people or use the system."

All of the 155 passengers on the plane survived. This dramatization of the incident, starring Tom Hanks, tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who pulled off the Miracle on the Hudson, as it's called. Hanks gives a solid performance as Sully, who is conflicted as to whether or not he endangered the lives of all of the people on board. Aside from the incident itself, most of the movie is dedicated to the debate over whether or not the plane could potentially have returned to LaGuardia. The FAA is made out to be a villain of sorts. Some may argue that this is not as interesting as the incident itself, or that it isn't good movie material. It still works as a film, as it is more about Sully himself than anything else. Director Clint Eastwood does a great job at telling the story, by cutting the incident into several scenes and having the rest be about how it affected Sully's life, and that of his family. After the incident, Sully himself had to deal with PTSD, as well as the stress of instantly becoming a celebrity. His wife and daughters also had to deal with a constant bombardment of attention from the press. This is the focal point of the movie. It's about the people, not the incident. In that regard, it is a very good movie, but if you're expecting it to be about the incident itself, go watch any of the documentaries made about it."

" Well-made, well-acted true story
",0.4215,-0.3878,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Sully' is the biopic of Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Hanks) and his First Officer, Jeff Skiles (Eckhart) who had to land their plane in New York's Hudson River in 2009, after both engines failed directly after take-off. Even though it was all over within five minutes, the film does a great job of exploring a bit of what happened before, a lot of what happened directly after and plenty of the investigation. It's edited well, so it's not all chronological.Surprisingly, this is Eastwood & Hanks' first collaboration, and they're both in good touch here - Hanks is the no-nonsense, but relatable soon-to-be-retired pilot, Eckhart is the slightly-younger and more enthusiastic co-pilot and Eastwood keeps the narrative flowing and never allows it to get too boring, technical or bogged down in the passenger's experiences. Linney is sparingly used as Sully's wife Lorraine, and Porter (O'Malley) is head of the NTSB investigation - essentially the 'bad guy'.The film works as an investigation/mystery, casting some doubt, but also has plenty of tension and action showing the actual crash and aftermath. While it's not sad per se, it did almost bring a tear to my eye in some parts, as it is a feel-good film at its heart, with ""this is some good news that New York really needed - especially when involving a plane"" really hitting home."

" Great story but the film left me cold
",0.3716,0.9201,2017-12-10 00:00:00,6,"True stories are always the best stories and Chesley Sullenberger's is certainly an extraordinary one. The film tells the story of the pilot of a doomed flight, whose skills and quick thinking saved all lives onboard. It's a remarkable story, though I do feel the film didn't do it full justice. It felt more like a quick fix rather than a proper account of the events that occurred. Too much of the film is set in the aftermath and as a result, it isn't the heart in mouth drama that it should have been.Tom Hanks is excellent, as he always is, though I much preferred him in the similar 'Captain Phillips'. His character was a lot more vulnerable in that film and it also did a much better job at building tension. While there is certainly tension in 'Sully', it is restricted to only a few scenes and the cutting back and forth doesn't help at all. Overall, not a bad film, but I was expecting something a lot better."
" Though its competently constructed, the film places more emphasis on the uninteresting aftermath than the actual 'miracle landing' itself.

Where the feature makes its first misstep is in placing more emphasis on the ensuing investigation than the actual 'miracle landing' itself, assuming that its audience will actually doubt for a second whether or not the protagonist pilot made the right call when he chose to (totally successfully, I might add) place the lives of his passengers above the monetary value of the plane he was flying. So, what you end up with is a piece that gets its main event over with within the first few minutes and then revisits it a number of tension-less times, including once more in full during the finale with no new information added seemingly to stretch the run-time to that all important 90-minute mark, before battering you over the head with a corporate investigation which couldn't mean less in terms of emotional investment. This is simply competent film-making but nothing more, thanks mainly due to the fact that its story isn't really as suited to this medium as it is to filling a lull in conversation, but even then its a little too late to be bringing it up now. 5/10"
" a mixed bag
",0.0,-0.9324,2017-11-21 00:00:00,7,"The good news : Eastwood wisely refrained from cheap melodramatics. Sadly the movie veers too much in the other direction (pardon the pun), causing the story to lose much of what made it so remarkable in the first place. ""Sully"" does not contain much in the way of epic grandeur, white-knuckle tension, unbearable suspense or trenchant comment. There's not even much dramatic conflict or contrast ; even the various aviation experts and inspectors grilling Captain Sullenberger are just hard-working people trying to do an ungrateful job.To continue with the good, the landing in the river is superbly filmed, from a technical viewpoint, and there is a fine performance by Hanks. It's a pity that Mr. Hanks has played this kind of role - competent and decent man rises to the challenge - so many times before : it is not a case of Captain Sullenberger being played by Tom Hanks, it is a case of Tom Hanks playing Captain Sullenberger, which is lethal to the suspension of disbelief. And yes, I do realize that there's an injustice involved,since Hanks only became a world-famous actor thanks to his hard work and stellar talent - but that's Art for you, she devours her own darlings.One also wonders at the way some of the characters were conceived. I do not know Mrs. Sullenberger - I've never even met her - and as a result it would be hugely presumptuous of me to write anything about her nature and temper. For all I know, or don't know, she may be one of the most delightful and enchanting persons living in the USA. Mrs. Sullenberger the character, however, is seriously annoying : dull, shallow, whining and ungrateful. One gets why her husband (again, I'm talking about the character) travels the world - anything to put 200 miles between him and boredom personified. It is less clear why he neglects to engineer a sad accident where his spouse falls out of an airplane.If I were real-life Mrs. Sullenberger, I'd go and consult a good lawyer with a background in libel cases."
" Underwhelming ending to a good movie
",0.4404,-0.8948,2017-11-15 00:00:00,6,"Captain Sullenberger and First Officer Stiles landed a plane on the river Hudson. It sounds quite miraculous and the premise of the film gripped me instantly.Director Clint Eastwood tricked me into thinking that this will be just some generic airplane disaster movie. The opening scene, where Sullenberger crashes the plane, turns out to be a nightmare, which is utilized fairly well in the movie. The landing on the river haunts the captain and Tom Hanks does excellent work in portraying the calm man who is tormented by fear and suspicion.Sully's wife and daughters are at home waiting for the crash investigation to be over and worried of him. Laura Linney portrays the wife and she was great. I loved her in the movie. I saw her performance in the movie Mr. Holmes and she portrayed fairly similar character in that movie as a worrying caretaker for aging Sherlock Holmes. She was very good and sympathetic in both movies.I love the premise of the movie. Sully's nightmares were really interesting, I loved the way Eastwood portrayed the human side of the accident.My first complaint is the supposed ""main antagonist"" of the movie. Mike O'Malley portrays Charles Porter, the man leading the investigation about the investigation. He performs well, but it is very unnecessary for his character to be so obnoxious in the movie. I sided both factually and emotionally with Sully in the very beginning of the movie, there was no need to put an antagonist in the film to make the viewer more emotionally invested in Sully. His character could've been there without him being a total jerk. Did the writers think that the viewer would not side with Sully in the movie? Are the geese that crashed with the plane the misunderstood heroes here?The screen time where characters are pitted against each other could've been dedicated to portray the nightmares of Sully even more deeply. Oh well.The highlight of the movie was the mid point where they show the plane get damaged, being piloted into the river and the passengers and the crew being rescued from the river.I was awestruck with it. I got fully caught with the scene and the scene made me cry. Everything with it hit me so hard, I definitely wasn't prepared for the scene to completely suspend my disbelief in it. The small character arcs of the passengers, the crew working during the emergency, the personnel in the flight control, the rescue crew, everything. I haven't been crying like this because of a movie since The Wrestler, and it was bad.There I was ready to give this movie, despite minor flaws, a 9/10 immediately.But after that the movie falls flat.After the mid point, everything in the movie feels just off. The investigation committee trying to make Sully guilty turns, of course, to be wrong in the movie. Sully is officially made a hero. Sully's nightmares end after he goes into a bar for a drink and there he figures out how to convince the committee that he did what he had to.The ending is so dissatisfying. The character buildup towards the end just feels so bland and obvious. Everything in the end just screams ""obviously this was going to end like this, what did you think"". I didn't want a surprise ending, but rather a satisfying ending.Maybe I should've sided with the geese.I rate this movie six Aaron Eckhardt's mustaches out of ten."

I've been deeply moved by this drama, Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckart are just excellent and make a really believable pilot duo, the humanity and steadiness of Sully is just amazing as he faces the cruel investigators. We care about Sully from the very start, because we can see he's a good man tormented by bad dreams about plane crashes, and I have a special mention for dialogues which are really enjoyable, Sully just always finds the right answer to the investigators of the crash, it's a real pleasure to see his confidence in what he did. I would have expected more presence for Eckart though. The co-pilot finds himself in an incredible situation, yet he doesn't even asks : ""are you sure about this ? Isn't there another way ?"", it really felt too passive during the crash. The psychology of Sully is really well-written, you can see he doesn't really like to be called a hero or being hugged, but still he fights back to not be called a criminal. A nice surprise to see Anna Gunn from Breaking Bad, playing here one of the investigators. She quite has the same administrative role in Breaking Bad so it fits her well.Cinematography is mastered even if not excellent, by director of photography Tom Stern who also collaborated with Eastwood on Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby. You can see the real pilot and crash victims meeting in the credits, so stay to the end. One of the most interesting movies of Clint Eastwood. I recommend."

It was done very well with just the right touch of drama. It's an American hero movie where the hero this time is not a soldier or a cop but an airline pilot. I enjoyed the movie from a professional standpoint. I'm not a pilot but in my line of work I'm very familiar with investigations of accidents and events and the Monday-Morning-Quarterbacking that goes along with it.

Anyone like me with a strong urge for aviation will heartily take this movie important which salutes the professionalism brought to the screen by the flight crew.Clint Eastwood, one of the revered actors and directors of all time, does it again drifting from his usual genre of fictitious stories, to capture the prompt decision the cockpit crew take. The film is based on real statistics and investigation which avoids sentimentality or drama unlike Denzil Washington's ""Flight"" (a good thriller) which fictionalized the real life accident into a heroic survival game receiving Oscar accolades. In that case, the film remains subdued with yet an another revered performance as a controlled captain of Airbus A320 showing the patience, diligence, and dedication of a senior captain equally supported by Aaron Eckhart as the first officer. Don't worry if the film didn't sweep major Oscar nominations, it's a sincere film on a heroic deed worth watching.Rating: 3 stars out of 4"
" Unbelievable
",0.2023,0.991,2017-10-09 00:00:00,10,"I cannot believe that this is based on a true story, even though I was 9 when it happened I remember reading the story and watching it on the news as it was being reported. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the man that was named a hero. However, he never wanted the mass media attention. If you haven't yet watched this, I urge you to watch it! It has been too long for cinephiles as this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that reveals the best of human nature. This film was bound to be a success no matter what but it was decided the minute Hanks and Eastwood were to collaborate. It is no doubt that we are in constant awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers it is instilled into us that we want to see crashes and planes falling apart. However, since this is not a fictional film it has to be as realistic as possible and even that is a lot to handle the film wrote itself in the fact that there was drama, intensity, action, and so on. The re-creation is so realistic that we as an audience almost end up following and doing what the flight attendants are telling us to do. This is a sign of a fantastic film as it shows that it has truly grasped the audience and shows that they haven't lost attention and they are still well engrossed in the film. As an audience we already know the conditions of the river and the below freezing temperature of it, this creates sympathy and fear for the people that are crash landing into it, as if it couldn't get any worse they know have to evacuate into a icy river that could surely have health effects. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, while all passengers are evacuating in true style Sully is doing his job and almost taking on that of a Ship Captain as he is the last one off of the plane as he is trying to count all of the passengers, which were a total of 155, as an audience we feel the desperation and anxiety that Sully is feeling as he is praying that he will count all 155 passengers. This has been one of the best films made and that came of 2016, I have seen the film twice and I have actually recommended to people and I would continue to recommend it to people, if you have not seen it, I urge you to do so.

It is nonetheless very impressively done and on the most part is still a good film, with a lot of great elements as well as a few not so convincing ones, and its honesty and understatement are to be admired. It takes a remarkable story and mostly does do it justice, though it is not hard to see why not everybody will like it.As well done the understated mood is, occasionally 'Sully' feels a little too muted even for what it's trying to portray. Other than the air, landing and rescue scenes, which are riveting and nail-biting, it does lack tension and some scenes are more compelling than others (the aforementioned air, landing and rescue scenes, Hanks in the bar and Hanks and Eckhart together for instances are more involving than any scene with the NTSB and Sully's wife).Laura Linney does very well as Lorraine and handles the character with dignity and empathy, but the role is thankless and underwritten, on top of that her screen time is pretty limited, Linney deserves better than this. More of a problem was the stock villain portrayal of the NTSB, far too extreme and very heavy-handed. The ending does satisfy for all that roots for Sully at the start, though the outcome was very much foreseeable for anybody familiar with the story and compared to the more sombre understated feel of the rest of the film it felt somewhat pat.Production values however are high. It is beautifully photographed with good use of locations and above average effects. The recreation scenes don't look too cheap either. Eastwood's direction is intelligent and admirably restrained. The music score is not the most unforgettable of ones, but it is still very well suited to the film's tone and wisely doesn't go over the top or feel anaemic.It's a very thoughtfully written film too and treats its audience and subject matter with sensitivity and respect. The subtle dry humour from Eckhart's character is well judged and not misplaced as it could easily have been. The story is not a tense or exciting one, but it's dealt with honesty and deep humanity with some inspiring and powerful moments.Hanks gives a master-class in grace, dignity and subtlety, holding everything together with great composure and telling a lot even with just his eyes. One really believes how much of an emotional toll being hailed as a hero but also being investigated has on Sully. Eckhart is sympathetic and provides some never overdone or too frequent dry humour that leavens things up. Linney does much with little and the rest of the cast do very well.Overall, very impressive if not miraculous. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

The film showed the professionalism of the crew, the passengers, and New York city's response team (maybe even a few Jersey folk) to the incident to save everyone on board.

Sully makes the difficult decision to land the plane on the Hudson river as he does not believe that he will make it back to the airport (despite air traffic control advising him to head back to LaGuardia). Sully is branded a hero for his actions by the public, but his superiors don't see things this way and begin trying to build a case against Sully...I remember hearing about this case on the news but was shocked that it happened as long ago as 2009 - I thought it happened more recently than that. My how time flies (no pun intended). On that basis and due to what little knowledge I had of the incident, I did find Sully to be interesting and fairly informative and it was also nicely balanced with enough exposition to get a reasonable understanding of the events and the aftermath (without ever getting boring) and it also had a few sequences showing the plane getting into difficulties which made it quite nervy and tense at times. These things serve the film well and make it worth watching, but for me despite these big positives I just felt as though something was missing..Whilst it is informative and tense, the film is also quite cold and the film never seems to do much to draw me into Sully and Skiles' world; considering how often the word 'human' is used I couldn't help but feel that rather ironically the film lacked something in the way of a 'human' touch. Sully and Skiles aren't given much development and at no point do we seem to get any insight or understanding of how they are feeling or what thoughts are going through their heads?? This meant that the film lacked a bit of depth and felt a bit superficial at times. The film also clumsily throws in a scene where Sully and Skiles are both appearing on David Letterman which not only served no real purpose but it also felt oddly out of sink with the rest of the film. The same could be said for the scenes showing Sully in his early days as a pilot which added very little to the story and seemed to only exist as filler.Despite some weaknesses, Sully is still worth watching as it has an interesting story and at just a shade over 90 minutes long it gets the job done fairly painlessly. For me though its cold delivery and the rather poor character development offered up here prevents it from being as great as it could have been."

The film is a dramatisation of the 2009 emergency plane landing on the Hudson river. The film stars Tom Hanks as Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. Hanks is the highlight of the film, he turns in a classy performance as usual. It's also clear to see though, that he didn't have much to work with.The film feels uninspired, maybe it's because there's not a-lot of dramatic tension in the real life events, save for the plane landing. However because the events are so fresh in everyone's mind, it's hard to forget what the outcome is. This means the film lacks any dramatic tension whatsoever.So now that we all know what were getting with the film what does it do to pull us in? The answers is nothing. Other then Tom Hanks the film has no punch. There are a couple scenes where Hanks is exhibiting PTSD. Rather then explore this subplot it's quickly swept under the rug, never to be brought up again.The other actors in the film are just there. The cinematography is bland. Nothing in the film really stands out. In the end the film is competently made, but it's played too safe.

One thing that rings true is the professionalism and thoroughness of investigations by the NTSB who's sole aim is to establish the cause of the accident and advise any safety recommendations that may arise. They are not their to judge and certainly do not hold hearings until all obtainable facts are at their fingertips. When this film came out I was waiting to see it with baited breath. Unfortunately I found it disappointing. It chopped backwards and forwards in time which I accept is a story telling technique but I think it was a little overboard BUT accept that that is a personal issue. Where I have a big problem is the portrayal of the NTSB who came across as a ""Gestapo"" type organisation intent on bringing Sully down. This is not a fair representation of the NTSB and I don't think it was necessary to sell the film. Please watch the many good documentaries on Air crash investigations, such as the ""Mayday"" series - available on ""youtube"". The one on this particular incident will show you what I mean.

Which ever reason it may be, sadly for me, it took away from the movie.Dr. Elizabeth Davis's apology meant little, to nothing at all. That entire panel seemed as if they were just ""caught out/caught red handed"" when Sully delivered his rationale, almost suggesting that, that piece of knowledge Sully brought to light, they already knew, but were hoping would fly under the radar, so they could condemn an innocent man... And because this is based on true events, it makes it especially disgusting to fathom.Beyond that, Sully is a good movie, just, good.

I watched a documentary about this plane accident some years ago on National Geographic, and I must say that having watched that documentary made the making of this movie very unnecessary in my opinion. And was this a story worth putting to the big screen? Well, I would say no, but that is only because I already saw the documentary. However, if you haven't seen the documentary or if you are somewhat unfamiliar with the actual events, then I would say that you would find the movie enjoyable. And in that case, then sure, the movie was worth putting to the big screen.The cast in ""Sully"" was good, and it was rather interesting and somewhat fun to watch both Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as pilots with fancy mustaches. And the people were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters.This is not a disaster movie in the traditional sense, where things have deadly consequences and there is one major disaster after the other taking place. No, this is a more realistic and down to earth, pardon the pun, type of disaster movie as it is based on actual events and because it resulted in no loss of life.What surprised me was the way that the accident committee were hellbent on blaming captain Sullenberger and co-pilot Skiles for their actions which saved all the lives of crew and passengers, and how adamant they were on relying on their flight simulation of the events. Corporate rigid thinking and ways of doing business, I guess.Personally, I didn't care much for seeing this on the big screen, as the documentary more than sufficed back in the day."

The juvenile rendering of the NTSB agents as cartoon character villains is a disservice of all those who try to protect the skies from airplanes deprived of their correct servicing and from terrorists as well. The film clubs the viewer over the head - or at least tries to - with the notion that the government and the media are evil, out to get heroes like Sullenberger. Abandon government regulation, the film cries out, led by the film's ""hero,"" the near senile Clint Eastwood, with his Fox News-rendered illusions. What is most disappointing on an emotional level is the unreal rendering of the man Sullenberger himself. As Hanks plays him, he has not a shred of a personality, is nothing but a stoic, jaded, unhappy misanthrope, which the real Sully isn't, as is seen at the end of the film, when he is actually shown smiling with his former passengers, something - smiling, that is- that he doesn't do throughout the entire film. Tom Hanks and Laura Linney should be ashamed: the nadir of their careers."

The problem is that a feature film needs to be built around that, and you feel the film straining to pad itself out. Hanks is really good in a role that pretty much tailor made for him. Aaron Eckhart provides solid support. As always, Eastwood crafts a well-made, no-nonsense film. But the film strains to create drama out of an National Transportation Safety Board investigation that never manages to feel like anything more than people doing the job they are supposed to do. Yes, there's some evidence that maybe Sully made the wrong decision, but that's fairly easily dismissed and nobody really fights it when a reasonable argument is made. It ends up feeling like a great 15 minute short wrapped up in a mediocre film."

It gave me more respect for flight attendants.It seems to have ruffled feathers at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It is my understanding the Mr. Sullenberger requested that the names of the NTSB be changed to fictional ones after he reviewed the script. The movie didn't paint a rosy picture of NTSB, but I wouldn't call it harsh either. I've have an experience with another state government agency which was quite similar to that portrayed of the NTSB in this movie. In my opinion, the NTSB people were being way too sensitive. The movie makes them look good at the end."

It was purely underwhelming.Before I explain further,let me first describe what ""Sully"" is all about.It was January 15,2009.The US Airways Flight 1549 piloted by Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles are coming from LaGuardia Airport towards Charlotte Douglas International Airport.But three minutes into the flight when the plane was at an altitude of 2,800 feet hit a flock of birds that disabled both engines of the plane.Without engine power and realizing that there are no airports around,Captain Sully decided to land the plane on Hudson River.Everyone hails the Captain as a hero.But the National Transportation Safety Board claims that Sully should have landed the plane at a nearby airport instead of putting the plane on the river.Now Sully must defend what he did at the Safety Board that he indeed acted correctly.The End.And knowing Hollywood being penchant for happy endings,the viewer would likely know what is going to happen.They know that Sully will definitely end as a hero and acted correctly or did movie would not have been made.The story was simple as that.In fact,the movie was short for it lasted only 90 minutes.It could have been interesting but it wasn't.The film was totally underwhelming as the viewer would probably not really get involved in Hanks' character nor the tension of the story as everything just happened without emotion.That includes the landing of the plane and the scenes at the Safety Board when Sully and Skiles were defending themselves.What saved it from disaster is definitely both Hanks and Eastwood.Tom Hanks provided a good performance as Sully.Eastwood's direction was decent.But it wasn't enough to have an interesting story.Overall,the movie just went to the motions of telling the story as it lacks tension,characterization and emotion.Truly underwhelming."

A pilot landed his plane on the Hudson River after a flock of geese struck the plane, causing it to lose engine power. The pilot, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger - called Sully for short - earned ample praise for his landing of US Airways Flight 1549 and saving all the crew and passengers. But the story had only just begun.Clint Eastwood's ""Sully"" looks not only at the landing, but at the investigation. The NTSB thought that Sully hadn't done what he should have and held several hearings about it. But Sully knew something that they didn't.Admittedly, the audience knows what the outcome is, so it's not that suspenseful. But even so, the movie reminds us that the human factor is one of the most important things in any decision. Tom Hanks does his usual outstanding job as the pilot whose sudden celebrity risks getting overshadowed by the investigation. Good support comes from Aaron Eckhart as the co-pilot, and Mike O'Malley (Burt on ""Glee"") as one of the investigators. I thought that Laura Linney as Sully's wife didn't get enough screen time. It would've been interesting to see how the event affected their relationship.Anyway, it's not a masterpiece - not Eastwood's best by any stretch - but I still recommend it. I guess that a slight downside is that Steve Mnuchin was involved in the production (I guess that he invested in it)."

" Quiet movie about Flight 1549 and its pilot
",0.0,0.9917,2017-06-26 00:00:00,8,"The heart of this movie is the spectacle -- beautifully staged and filmed -- of a passenger airplane landing on a river in the middle of a large city in the winter and all its passengers getting rescued. By anyone's standards, this is remarkable thing and the worthy subject of a 96-minute movie. Realizing this, Eastwood presents a realistic, appropriate and detailed film depiction of the crash. It was fascinating to watch, even though the viewer already knows how it ends.The rest of the movie is a populist ""little guy v. the man"" kind of film, with the airline, the investigating committee and the insurers cast in the role of ""the man"", and the pilot (Tom Hanks) and co-pilot (Aaron Eckhart) in the role of the ""little guy"". In the end, the heroism is not just in landing the plane, but in being able to face with dignity and confidence the bureaucratic/financial firestorm that comes afterwards .Hanks and Eastwood also engage in a sort of ""portrait of heroism"". They show us more about Sully and what kind of man he is. The pilot was just a man doing his job, but he did it well and he survived (in many ways) a life-changing accident that could have destroyed him. Is he a genuine hero? This movie makes that argument. America needs heroes; the movie industry loves making films about heroes. The movie was restrained in its flag-waving, thankfully.I thought this was a good film, although maybe a little on the pensive side. It's worth about 7.5, but I'll round it up."
" Watch this Film for the Cinematography and Tom Hanks if Nothing Else
",0.0,0.8792,2017-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Although politically charged and sometimes overly dramatic, Sully tells the incredible story of the pilot who landed a plane on the Hudson River. More specifically, the film deals with the aftermath consequences of the pilot's decision.In early 2009, the now infamous Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, played by the equally famous Tom Hanks in the film ""Sully"", attempted to make an emergency landing on January 15. Although he tried to reach an airport, he ends up landing a full plane on the Hudson River and becomes a national hero overnight. Watching these events take place on-screen is breathtaking. However, the aftermath of the events prove to be much less amusing. Sully is eventually investigated and questioned for his decision to land the plane on the Hudson. Although ""Sully"" is a short film to begin with, the drawn out investigation made the film appear to be much longer than about an hour and a half. The directing and cinematography is very tastefully done. Which shouldn't be surprising considering the film was directed by Clint Eastwood. But the story leaves the audience wanting. Ultimately, Sully is exonerated in the film thanks to simulations that prove the wisdom of the famed pilot's split-second decision making. But the investigation is portrayed as unnecessary and mildly intrusive. Many people took offense to the way the National Transportation Safety Board was portrayed in the film. This caused a little controversy among those who work for the investigative agencies responsible for protecting the public. The thing every good movie needs is a villain. Unfortunately, in ""Sully"", the villain happens to be working for the public. Unlike Canadian geese."

Of course the whole cast added to the story in their own way. The special effects are top notch, and I am surprised that the Academy ignored a truly great story this year.

" NTSB portrayed too negatively

I understand that it was used to create tension in the movie that it otherwise going to lack but I wish that Eastwood could have found another way. I'm not surprised that the actual NTSB complained I could hear members of the public saying ""damn bureaucrats"" as they left the movie. That IS unfair and just leaves the public trusting agencies even less.But in all other respects I think it is a good movie. If you recall - Sully did return to flying - but not for long. I think the underlying reasons are well hinted at in the movie. Sully approved of the portrayal of him. It might have been more interesting to twist the movie around that. I've seen Jeff Skiles talk a couple of time and had a chance to chat to him a couple of times. I think the actor Aaron Eckhart NAILS his character. Tom Hanks - less so as Sully. He is overweight for starters and I couldn't quite suspend disbelief and go with it.There are some good underlying nods to the fact it was training and Crew Resource Management (CRM) between the pilots that got the plane down successfully and that Sullenburger was unhappy with the media portrayal of him as the sole hero. Reminded me of BA38 in 2008 when the captain of the flight stressed to the press that it was the FO who successfully pancaked the plane onto the runway when the engines quit on short final and that he did his CRM part beside him as appropriate.Now the actual effects - I have to say that when I fly the Hudson and head south over the GW Bridge - I always think ""This is what Sully and Skiles saw......"" Having seen the movie and now gone and found more plots of their ground track. Boy was I wrong. For all practical purposes they flew around the end of the East tower of the GWB as they were so low. MAN were they low. It was great bit of stick and rudder flying (with a little help from the computer - go read the NTSB report) and that alone is worth the price of admission. You could edit this whole movie down to the 208 seconds of the flight and the evacuation and rescue. That would be a total of 24 fabulous minutes of footage! Don't rush out as soon as the credits roll. Worth watching them too."

This is the story of that incident, and its aftermath.Great dramatization of an amazing event. While the the events and skill involved therein are pretty incredible I was skeptical that this could be made into an engaging, entertaining movie. I need not have worried. Director Clint Eastwood turns a story that could easily have ended up as a boring linear docudrama into something very interesting. Through starting the movie AFTER the climactic event, the use of back-and-forth time jumps and focusing as much on the aftermath as the event itself, Eastwood has made something very engaging and intriguing.There is a degree of dramatic license involved, especially with regard to the NTSB hearings, but Eastwood and writer Todd Komarnicki needed a way to introduce an element of uncertainty and drama into a story with a known outcome, and that was it."

" Hard to dislike a hero movie, but...
",0.1531,-0.1768,2017-06-08 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to like this film. I really did. Having seen pilot Sullenberger on numerous TV shows, and recognizing him as an ordinary guy who just happened to ""do his job"" as he has said, at a perfect moment in time- thereby saving the lives of 155 ""souls"" aboard the ill-fated flight, January of 2009. The problem is that, often, the truth just isn't as exciting as a fictional screen play. Director Clint Eastwood attempts to show the (apparently truthful) friction between the NTSB Inquirey board and Sullenberger, but what he gets is cascading clichés: the heartless bureaucrats who refuse to look past the computer data and simulators, the incredulous pilots who are suffering sleep deprivation and nightmares, and a public clamoring to give Sully the keys to New York City. Also making cameos are the dutiful wife back in the burbs, worried about purchasing some casually mentioned house, and a sympathetic union rep who shrugs a lot.Missing from this film version is the hysteria, noise, and confusion of a crash scene -Sully calls it a water landing- and the real look of people who feel as though they may die a cold, watery, death. The survivors are too collected, too calm and not very believable. Eastwood directs ""Sully"" as an homage, documentary style, to the extraordinary skill of Sullenberger. Unfortunately, Tom Hanks, as Sully, underplays Sullenberger to the extent that we see nothing of the man. On a ticky tacky point, Hank's make up job and gray hair only call attention to the fact that he really isn't Sullenberger. On a technical note, the camera changes bothered me a great deal. The broad shots alternated with obviously hand held camera shots that could have been made with a film student's iPhone. Maybe this shouldn't get in the way of telling a great story, but it does to this reviewer. Most bothersome of all is the way the story is told in flashbacks that seem completely contrived. Borrowing flashback styles from any number of classic films, Eastwood mishandles this story by almost signaling to the viewer, ""Here it comes!"" On a positive note, you should see this film if you want to see an accurate portrayal of a ""hero"" who doesn't want to be one; the admirable and unassuming Sully Sullenberger. Just don't expect a wide range of emotional response from Tom Hanks. He played Sully all too well."

" Brace For A Slight Impact.
",0.0,-0.9736,2017-05-30 00:00:00,6,"What can you say about a mild-mannered elderly pilot who in 128 seconds diagnosed the problem with his US Airways passenger jet, reviewed his options, and chose the only one available which, despite the dangers, was overcome by the mild-mannered elderly pilot's skill as a flier? Not a hell of a lot. You need to build a full-length feature film around a few minutes of extreme stress and ultimate catharsis. Captain Sullenberger was a hero who ditched his huge airplane in the middle of the Hudson River with none of his 153 passengers suffering more than a scratch or two. That was January of 2009, which prompts me to observe that time is beginning to fly almost as fast as an L-1011 these days.But how do you fill up the movie? In classical narratives you require a protagonist who's trying to accomplish something and an antagonist who's trying to stop him from getting it done, but there's nothing like that in Sully's story. Everyone did was he was supposed to do -- not just the captain but the co-pilot, the flight attendants, the passengers, and the first and second responders. Given the circumstances -- the loss of power over both engines because of a bird strike -- it could hardly have turned out better.In such circumstances you need to provide the audience with enough information to infer the non-existent antagonist. In this case, the targets were easy: the ""suits."" That would be the National Transportation Safety Board and the insurance companies who stand to lose a great deal of money. So the modest and unassuming Sully must be called before a board of inquiry that looks exactly like the setting of an appellate courtroom. The judges sit up there at the long bench, full of evidence, pomposity, cynicism, and authority, while looking down at Sully and the other prisoners, I mean witnesses, below. The judges aren't chosen for their beauty either. They frown a lot and use tones of voice that are ripe with innuendo.Does Sully come through this and all the stresses associated with celebrity victorious -- in one piece? Are you kidding? If he hadn't, there would be no movie. So the film fakes its heavies. It also lacks sufficient technical detail so that the audience can't follow with any accuracy just what it is that Sully and his first officer are doing during the emergency. The procedures aren't that complicated. The emergencies described in a TV series like ""Mayday"" (""Air Crash"") are laid out so that even a non-techie can follow them flawlessly. But that would require a narrator, and this isn't a story about technology. It's a story about one man -- Captain Chesley Sullenberger and his behavior under stress. The other characters, his first officer and even his wife, Laura Linney, are strictly ancillary. It's a character study and it's well played.On the surface it doesn't give star Tom Hanks much to do because Sully was quiet and always controlled. But there's the challenge. Hanks has to convey emotions with the slightest changes of his facial expressions, a slight squint, a barely perceptible smile, the blankness of a focused attention. As for his voice it never changes except for a few second while the airplane is gliding earthward, or rather waterward, and he has to speak to the Air Traffic Controllers because a shortage of time demands it.There's nothing spectacular about the film. The CGIs are modest. Nobody shrieks with anger or with terror. Everyone is respectful and polite. Hardly anyone sobs. And nobody's head gets wrenched out of its socket. Even the suits, sitting up there in all their grandeur, come around at the end and freely, apologetically, admit that Sully did exactly the right thing under existing conditions. He really DID too. The Airbus A-320 that he was flying was definitely not built with the prospect of a ditching in mind. The airplane has two big jet engines, one hanging low under each wing. The object in landing on water is to keep the airplane as level as possible because if it touches tail down, the nose will pitch forward forcefully and the stop will be abrupt and destructive. And of course if the pilot lands nose down, he's humped. But a smooth, level landing on water us almost impossible with two huge objects hanging from the wings. If the airplane isn't kept almost exactly level, one engine with catch the water sooner than the other, the airplane will spin around in the direction of the lowest engine and possibly disintegrate. Sully was lucky he was over the smooth Hudson River and not the open sea.Clint Eastwood has chosen to show the emergency landing in several disjointed flashbacks but we never lose track of events or of where we are. Sully is a very intelligent man, a highly skilled pilot and deserves his celebrity, however much he may or may not have wanted it. Generally, a nice job, a full-length film built around a few minutes of extreme danger that doesn't lose the viewer's interest."

It's a human story, about someone who though he did the right thing. But suddenly has doubts. You can't really compare this to the movie Denzel Washington did (which was also very powerful, one could argue even more powerful overall). These are different characters and different situations overall. If you like Drama and suspense combined you could do much worse ..."

" Great story, decent movie
",0.6249,0.994,2017-05-13 00:00:00,6,"I was living in Australia when I watched this story, soon after it had happened. It was all over the news. I remember, still today, Sully's apparent calmness when talking about the event. This is one of those stories that one believes to be fiction and part of a feel-good Christmas film, but it was real, it was great, it warmed my heart, and it renewed my respect for pilots, who certainly are not just cool dudes in pretty uniforms.Knowing the end of the story is a tricky thing for a film that is not documentary and intends to build tension and interest in the viewer. Eastwood achieved that in different ways: 1-by just playing a non-linear story that does go back and forward in time; 2-by making us see Sully behind doors (his personal background with aviation, his emotional self with PSD after the events on the Hudson unfolded, his worries about his family future); 3-by creating a set of villains (in this case the NTSB investigators), and 4-by creating a situation that builds tension (the investigation on whether Sully's act of heroism was on the contrary a lack of judgment.To me, the main problem with the film is not what is in the film, but with what's not there. Sully is based on Captain Sullenberg's own memoir and, therefore, we see just one color. I would have loved knowing more about the co-pilot and his PDS, of which he also suffered, get to know some of the passengers flying on the film, seeing more about Sully's daughters' reaction to the events, seeing more details about the NTSB behind-doors investigation going on, and building a bit of more tension around that.The acting is good overall, especially on Hanks' part, who is able to convey Sully's real mix of his usual external calmness and the inner turmoil that he experienced after the event. I also liked Eckhart as his co-pilot,and Linney as his wife.I loved the special effects that reproduce the events on the Hudson as the landing on the river looks totally real not just special effects.Overall, this is a very enjoyable feel-good movie and story. Yet, the events being so well-documented and internationally well known, and so close in time, it is difficult to get overly wowed by a story that was, indeed, wow."
" It's a good thing Tom Hanks was on that plane
",0.4404,0.9712,2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,This movie is based on the true story of how Tom Hanks piloted a plane when it was going to crash - but he perfectly completed a water landing in the Hudson river and nobody was killed. But then - some haters who worked for the airport tried to hurt Tom Hanks feelings - and Tom Hanks was sad. Then he learned to overcome - because he is Tom Hanks. I did not know that Tom Hanks was a pilot. But he is good at acting - and good in this film when he plays himself. The scene where the plane lands in the Hudson is pretty well made. Apparently - Clint Eastwood was there too - because he directed this film. Two Face is also in this movie - but this was before he was Two-Face - and so he still had just one face. I liked this movie. Tom Hanks is a great person. He should hopefully win his fourth Oscar for this film.
" Risky business
",-0.2023,0.9087,2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"Late in the day, my thoughts have returned to Sully, Clint Eastwood's engaging movie that tells of US Airways's pilots Captain Chesley Sullenberger and co-pilot Jeff Skiles who successfully landed their plane full of passengers on the Hudson river after the plane's engines were disabled by hitting a flock of geese. The passengers lived but the geese and their kith and kin were not so lucky as the accident precipitated a cull of the dastardly, life threatening feathered fiends.Sully became a popular hero, but the communications and data gathering Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System lead to an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board which used computer models to suggest that Sully should have followed instructions and headed for a near by airfield. Here, Eastwood draws on themes from science fiction, pitting human 'gut feeling', experience and decision making against the apparently inescapable logic of the machine.Sully himself is presented as a distinctly American type of hero, an average type of guy who you know would make a good neighbor. In Hollywood, this type is often contrasted with 'egg heads' ( in this case the investigators with their computer projections) and suspect bureaucratic types. Even his nickname 'Sully' suggests an amiable sort of guy. In Britain Sullenberger would have been nick named 'Sullen' or some sort of derogatory reference to beef burgers and made fun of until he actually became sullen (or obese from being driven to comfort eating fast food).It is worth noting that the inquiry is just one area where Eastwood has used artistic license to create a dramatic conflict. In reality, computer models failed to predict a successful landing at either of the two available air fields. And Sully and the NTSB raised concerns about the way the film depicted the investigation as an adversarial process. But having just watched The Andromeda Strain, I can tell you a dispassionate investigation makes for boring viewing and, even though we know the outcome, Sully is never less than gripping.What gives Sully a lot of its emotional power, is the film's up front echoes of 9/11. The safe landing is good news from the skies above New York. I did found a scene where Sully imagines his plane crashing into a tower a little on the nose, but this film is all about healing the psychic wounds of that terrible day in September. No one conveys a quietly troubled mind better that Tom Hankes, staring out over the New York skyline while waiting to appear before the investigators.So a lot of narrative work has gone into dramatizing what would seem an already dramatic situation. We are not watching reality in the raw. And nowhere is the film more fictionalized that its treatment of risk. Miy mind kept turning to Tom Wolfe's book 'The Right Stuff' that explores the culture of test pilots flying some of the most dangerous planes ever created, prototypes of the jets and rocket engines that eventually helped Man journey to the Moon. These were planes that were so experimental that repeated failure was a likelihood and yet the pilots saw accidents as the result of a failure of pilot competency.Sociologists have found that a similar culture exists among middle aged men who turn to motorcycling. Objectively, motorcycles are inherently dangerous where as cars are safety cages on wheels. Yet motorcyclists continually attribute accidents to errors of judgment on the part of the cyclist. What this means for the film Sully is that audiences become trapped in an unrealistic either or scenario in which the outcome is entirely dependent on Sully's decision making and skill. Either he was a rogue pilot incompetently defying his orders to land at an airfield and putting the lives of his passengers at risk or he was a highly competent and skillful pilot who drew on years of experience to save the lives of passengers by achieving a safe land few if anyone else could.But there's a third possibility Luck. By chance, on this occasion everything turned out well. But it needn't have. And Sully's skill might not have been the deciding factor. A whole host of other things were. But that's hard to take on board. Not least because this powerful human drama plays to our deepest bias, so deep it is called Fundamental attribution Error. We want the world to be under our control even when events are the outcome of the situation.And with well made, well acted, well scripted films like Sully it is hard to be a nay sayer."

Not believable but would have an attorney present if true.The sequencing of this film was disjointed and was in need of just a couple of sub-titles to let us know the time frame, location, and relative significance. I was never confused but those that did not consume main stream media during this event may need some help with connecting the dots.I would highly recommend that the flight attendants come up with something more instructional and less elusive than the term Brace! What the hell does that mean, who even uses that terminology, and other than feel scared as F it does not help at all to assist frantic scared passengers. I live very close to LAX and sometimes late at night they change the flight path directly over my head and is so loud my windows vibrate. Seeing this film makes me even more worried that something like this could happen right in my neighborhood. Good Grief!I have adored Tom Hanks since ""Big"" and imho he can do no wrong. Seeing interviews with the real Sully makes me think he did a perfect capture of his calm, cool, and collected nature. Bravo my friend! I felt most proud of this accomplishment by a seasoned pilot, who else could have pulled this off, Gordon Cooper?High recommend for Clint's attempt to recreate the entire rescue scene, amazing! And the lovely sense that GOD exists and whatever force that is, protected 155 lives on the Hudson. AMEN"

It's a good story, just not much happens which is why the movie is less than 90 minutes. We get to see Captain Sully and his thoughts of what might have happened. Then we get a visual of the flight that day and how the plane landed in the water. And in conclusion, we get insight into the investigation and whether Sully and the co pilot made the right decision.FINAL VERDICT: Overall, it was interesting, just not enough for a full length movie.

" Excellent - but the documentary is better than the movie
",0.7351,0.9857,2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,"Best film I've seen this year. More of a dramatised documentary than a movie, but more powerful because it represents a true story. Real-life heroes don't wear capes, they aren't out for revenge or tortured souls .... they're often just quiet, modest, professional people who do their jobs really well, and keep their calm when >95% of us would crap ourselves. In the words of his wife, Capt Chesley Sullenberger ""hates surprises and always plans ahead"". The documentary about Sully is arguably more interesting than the rather contrived court-room drama of the investigation which dominates the film. In the real world, calm heroics come at a price. Sullenberger suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, lost 13 pounds in two days after his miracle landing on water, and loathed the attention. If you get the DVD, watch the feature documentary - it's as good as the film (no disrespect to Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, their movie is excellent). The interesting thing is - there's a world full of Sullys, and 99.99% of them will never be recognised - but they just do their best anyway. In Sully's case, he gave New York good news, involving a plane - and that really was a miracle."
" Excellent movie starring Tom Hanks

Tom Hanks plays the heroic pilot who is being hailed a hero yet some news reporters think that his a fraud because they don't believe for a second that the engines were at fault and that he couldn't have saved all those people at the time it happened. Chelsey(Hanks)must prove to the members of the public that he is telling the truth of what happened(which is told in flashbacks from when he got into piloting and the time it happened in January 2009). Since the crash,Chelsey keeps getting nightmares of what if the plane crashed in one of the buildings and never landed in the River Hudson. So will he tell the news reporters what really happened and will they believe him?Also starring Aaron Eckhart as Hanks Co.Pilot and directed by legendary film star Clint Eastwood this hour and a half film is definitely worth watching. As for me I was always a fan of Tom Hanks,as you could say his my favourite actor of all time. His been on the go since the 80's having starred in the likes of Big,Splash,all the Toy Story films,the list goes on and on. Packed with suspense and thriller this film Sully is the kind of film to watch if you love plane crashes or true life stories. 9/10"
" All about Hanks's performance really
",0.0,0.9595,2017-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Sully is a movie based off the true events where captain sullenberger landed the plane he was flying from New York to Charlotte on the Hudson River. Just after taking off from LaGuardia airport, US Airways Flight 1549's engines had a huge flock of birds fly straight into their engines and had both taken out upon impact. The pilot and co-pilot had to scramble to figure out what the hell they could do to land safely and ensure every passengers survival. Tom Hanks and his acting really is what makes this movie worth a watch. It's a relatively short film and it feels short because of the crash sequences and the scenes showing what actually happened during the whole terrifying ordeal. I really liked those scenes that focused on what actually happened because that makes it all real and it puts actual human faces to this true event. Aaron Eckhart does a good job with his role too, he plays the co-pilot that assisted captain sullenberger in pulling off the ""miracle on the Hudson"". I bought both all of the performances in the film and I thought the scenes showing what happened were done well. Other than that the other scenes don't really carry much weight, that's why it's not like a 9 or a 10. With all factors considered, I think a 7 out of 10 is fair for sully."
" Polished and competent but nothing more
",0.1655,0.9929,2017-04-18 00:00:00,4,"Clint Eastwood is such a conservative director. This film is extremely competent, the storytelling is very secure, but it is totally lacking in anything more than that.This is definitely not a film that sets you thinking the day after about the scenes, realising 24 hours after seeing the film something new about it, this film is the absolute reverse of that.Although you will not get bored watching this film you will have forgotten all about it thirty minutes after it is over and you will not ever think about it again.The facts of the story are mostly true in this, but one aspect of the story is exaggerated in order to create more drama. To me this illustrates the lack of imagination of the director. It is clear that Eastwood could only conceive of the film with a strong dramatic tension at its centre to maintain the viewer's interest. It is true that this works but when you find out that this strong dramatic tension wasn't anything like as great in real life, the only thing the film had is undone.Eastwood does show us events out of chronological order and the storytelling is always completely solid and that is an achievement. Hanks's Sully is totally convincing. Very good performances are everywhere in this film. Unfortunately the film has nothing to offer the viewer outside this competency.I think Clint Eastwood should not have built this film around that exaggerated dramatic tension and instead done a thoughtful film about the USA, about society in the US, about heroes and how they could so easily be undone about so much else. We could have had a film that sent the audience home with food for thought, but what we get instead is a competently told film with very little imagination."

",0.0,0.9712,2017-03-30 00:00:00,6,"This is a great story and Hanks and Ekhart deliver strong performances, and that really should be enough to make a great movie but sprinkled throughout it are cliché shot after cliché dialog. Sully jogs, and 'thinks', almost getting hit by a cab driver who delivers a cliché cab driver line. Lot's of cliché 'thinking' shots cos we've got to know that Sully is 'thinking'. It just comes across as uninspired obvious film making and we should be seeing better from Eastwood and whoever wrote the script. Eastwood and script writer also choose to manufacture confrontation when in the original story it wasn't there, showing they fell short on the skill and ability to tell an exciting story about decent good people doing good things in difficult situations without making stuff up. Artistic license is in how you tell the story, not the details of it. Maybe it's time Eastwood retired to day time telly making,"
" Fantastic Movie
",0.5574,0.8794,2017-03-21 00:00:00,9,Sully is one of the best movies i have watched in a long time. After following the story on this accident since the day it happened i was quite excited to learn they were making this movie. I think its fantastic that they have Tom Hanks playing the captain of the flight. He plays the part absolutely flawlessly. The movie is put together very well and shows very accurate events from the awful incident of the US Airways Airbus landing on the Hudson river.
" Airworthy - worth a rental/viewing
",0.2263,0.938,2017-03-09 00:00:00,8,"We live in Charlotte, where this ill-fated Airbus A320 now resides in an aviation museum adjacent to the CLT airport. I took my wife to see the mangled jetliner two years ago. She, not being from America, nor in America at the time of the accident, was not familiar with the January 15, 2009 water landing on the near-frozen Hudson River next to Manhattan.When looking for a decent rental at our local Red Box yesterday, she asked if this movie (Sully) was about 'that' plane. I told her that it was, and we went ahead and swiped our debit card and took the DVD home.I was expecting an average (5-stars-out-of-ten), solid, but probably not exceptional Eastwood-directed movie ... and was pleasantly surprised. We both found the acting to be superb. Hanks didn't 'overplay' his real-life, heroic-yet-modest pilot. I especially liked his reflective and anxious moments alone. Moreover, I thought that this movie was a fair rendering of the man, the gut-wrenching 5-minute flight, the media circus, and the governmental inquisition aftermath. My wife scored it an 8.5 (she thoroughly loved it) and I gave it a 7.5 (maybe I'm too critical in my old age). Thus, 8 stars it gets from us. You could certainly spend $1.61 and two hours much worse."

But it's shameful that the airplane itself was never mentioned in the positive light.I mean, how many airplanes have survived landing on water in one piece? If the plane was any weaker it would break in two or three pieces upon impact, and no rescue crews would be there in time. It would sink like a stone.But this particular airplane (Airbus A320) survived abnormal deceleration when it hit the water and got submerged for a moment, losing the speed quickly under the enormous water resistance. It didn't break like many other planes that landed on water. Instead it stayed afloat long enough for all the passengers to be saved. In fact, it didn't sink even hours after the accident.There are numerous cases of airplanes breaking up after landing on water because they weren't structurally strong enough. This was a good plane. Give it some credits."
" best and emotional movie 2016
",0.7003,0.9032,2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger has experienced both. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.On January 15, 2009, US Airways pilots Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles board US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 feet (approx. 850 m), the Airbus A320 strikes a flock of birds, disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports. Sully landed the aircraft on the Hudson River. The crew and passengers evacuate without casualty. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him with nightmare, and he repeatedly imagines the plane crashing into a building.Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS suggest that the port engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. The National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.Sully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been pilot error, which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run emergency checks before deciding to land the plane.The two simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is landed. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard."
" Another impressive performance by Tom Hanks

All the lives were at stake and still he pulled something very unusual and miraculous. The sound of the film is terrific.Tom Hanks has been excellent again as he balances those emotions with subtlety and grace. Tom did it in the film- Captain Phillips and now again...an outstanding performance.This is the best film of 2016 so far. Top Notch work by Client Eastwood.

I give the movie only 5 stars because I question the portrayal of the NTSB as the ""bad guys"". Ah, but in Hollywood's version of reality there always has to be bad guys. Right?That is my only criticism of the movie. My wife and I actually enjoyed it, and I cannot think of anyone else who could have played Sully so convincingly. Hanks portrayed accurately the reality of what Sully experienced. I waited until I read Sully's book before writing my comment. I wanted to know if the NTSB hassled him as much as the movie depicted. There was nothing there. If there was, at least Sully did not write about it.Does Eastwood not fly anymore? Does anyone involved in this movie not fly? Even if the NTSB did ask hard questions, that is their job. No need to imply that they had bad motives."
" Well-Made Movie, But A Complete Lack Of Conflict Keeps It From Greatness
",-0.7096,0.9656,2017-02-27 00:00:00,5,"There is no doubt that ""Sully"" is a well-made film. I don't think Clint Eastwood (director) could do anything less at this point in his career. The tone is proper, the acting is fine, and the story is an inspiring one. It's just missing that one thing any film needs in order to have any dramatic purpose: conflict.""Sully"" tells the story of Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), the pilot of a passenger jet who, along with co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), experiences dual-engine failure shortly after takeoff. With seemingly no other resort, Sully guides the plan down into the icy Hudson River, and all 155 passengers and crew are rescued safely.Here's the problem with ""Sully"", flat-out: It doesn't have any conflict. Eastwood is a master at telling two sides of a story, but in this case only one side exists. No matter how evil Eastwood makes the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) look for questioning Sully, or the couple scenes where Sully beings to doubt himself, the audience is never given plausible evidence to believe that Sully is anything but a hero. It makes for a good feel-good story, sure, but not necessarily up on the big screen where some drama needs to be present.All that being said, there is nothing technically wrong with the film. The airplane scenes are thrilling, the acting is solid all the way through, and Eastwood's tone (set by the real-life visuals and simple music) is right. If you perhaps know nothing about Sully's story, you might be completely drawn in.To me, this is the type of film that might actually work better 5-10 years down the road, being watched by audiences that don't have any knowledge of the events. Since they won't know the details like current audiences do, future watchers might be able to get more invested.As it stands, however, ""Sully"" is a film that is very well-made but just doesn't have the greatest dramatic story to tell. One would think it would be, but instead it just lacks that central conflict that any great movie needs. As such, I can't really give it the highest of marks (even if it is little fault of the film's own). At this point in his career, Eastwood can do any project he wants...and he's earned that. But some will be better/more interesting than others, and I felt ""Sully"" feel somewhere in the middle of that spectrum."
" A better recent Eastwood, but still (typically) flawed.
",0.2382,0.7612,2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Eastwood's more recent films have often left me wondering if he has been approaching, or even reached, the logical end of what has been a lengthy career. I have often considered him one of my favorite directors. While his films are sometimes and somewhat imperfect, perhaps self-indulgent, they are usually interesting, and possess a particularly unique quality.I can recall this film being criticised for it's re-showing the last few minutes of the flight. In another film this might provide greater insight, or reveal a new dimension to the event, perhaps a twist of some sort. In Sully this appears to both serve as a departure from the rather pedestrian events before and after the landing, keeping the viewer interested, and also to reinforce that this was an event that was experienced by many New Yorkers. Perhaps reinforcing to Americans that this was a significant national event. Eastwood is certainly no stranger to infecting his films with his personal ideologies, and I suspect this film yet another example of the director's politics at work. This was most apparent in the decision to depart in corny and dramatic fashion from the truth of events following the event.Such significant distortions in a film pretending to be factual and biographic should come as no surprise to viewers familiar with the liberties taken in Eastwood's other biopics, particularly American Sniper. I can only attribute these unnecessary deviations from an honest portrayal of events and characters to the favorite tricks of a beguiling, but sometimes clumsy storyteller/myth-maker, if not the direct effect of a director whose political axe requires grinding with each and every film. Be that grievance one with big government, or the crippled that can't access his restaurant, or his love affair with war heroes that are confirmed notorious bullshitters with the moral fiber a gnat.Like most of Eastwood's films this is a quality product, it is dry, but well filmed, and remains engaging. It is unfortunate that while his films appear so convincingly authoritative, and grounded within the real, they are persistently undermined by their creator's decision to be creative or dishonest regarding the characters and narrative.7/10"
" Fantastic job by Clint Eastwood
",0.5574,0.9882,2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Before watching the film I wasn't sure if Clint Eastwood would pull it off. The story he had to put on screen wasn't really full of exciting twists, mystery or adventures - there's only so much to tell. To my amazement it was brilliantly done in every department - great script and directing, with Tom Hanks doing a really believable and excellent job. I couldn't find fault with this film apart from the story itself - not that it's uninteresting or unheroic but solely as a material for a movie. Clint Eastwood got the best he could out of it.A normal approach would be to unveil the story as it happened: start with the accident and follow with the investigation. I was afraid it would be a bit too predictable and therefore uninteresting. Instead, the creators used the only possible approach to make this interesting - a non-linear story-telling. They take us on a journey going back and forth in time during and after the accident and even a couple of quick flashbacks into pilot's earlier years as a military pilot and his adolescence years as a young pilot trainee, into the emotional life of the man.The film deals with more that just the action itself (although that is brilliantly done) but with the human aspect, with our ability to be honest and straightforward when we ""have to do our job"" and act on something that is not prescribed by the protocols and procedures (exactly what the captain has done) - in this case the investigators who, being fully aware the pilot did something extraordinary and worthy of praise, are bent on accusing him of making a dreadful mistake and endangering human lives, totally forgetting about the human aspect - something that no computer or protocol they rely on can ever predict, calculate or evaluate. A wonderful piece of work from a professional. Highly recommended."

",0.2924,0.9816,2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,"The scene where the rescue team arrived was so soothing. Amazing screenplay and the sound effects made the movie stick to the heart as I watched.There was an added thrill in the scene of the meeting with NTSB and pilots. That moment when the blame was on the pilot but Tom Hanks turned the tables by explaining them the differences between simulations and reality, was a comfort to watch.The acting was superb and so was the casting. Tom Hanks pulled it off brilliantly as he always does.There is not much of story left after you've seen the trailers. It's a biography movie and one of the best ones I've watched."
" Defining A Hero
",0.5574,0.999,2017-02-18 00:00:00,9,"The amount of effort that goes into painting a negative world these days is amazing. News stories tend to follow the old adage of ""if it bleeds it leads"". Both Trump and Obama are painted in the most negative light by those who disagree with them. The trust of congress is at an all-time low. And yet on the rare occasion we are given the chance to glimpse the possibilities of man. We get to learn of someone who steps up at the worst possible moment and know that deep down each of us possesses that ability.SULLY is the latest film directed by Clint Eastwood, a man known to play fictional heroes, and tells the real life story of Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), the pilot who in 2009 successfully landed his passenger plane on the Hudson River in New York City and saved the lives of 155 passengers on board. A film made about what happened wouldn't make a feature but a great short film. The bare facts laid out start to finish. But this movie is about more than just those facts.Without giving us a detailed in depth look into the past life of ""Sully"", the movie does give us a glimpse behind the man through a few flashbacks and various insights into the days following the water landing. The flashbacks don't take much screen time but show both Sully's passion for flying and his mindfulness when it came to safety. When all of the notoriety was going on he was setting himself up to go into business with just that in mind, safety.The film chooses to focus more on what happened after the water landing. The scrutiny that came down on both Sully and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) was intense. While an incident like this would immediately call for an investigation was to be expected, the vehemence with which the investigators took to the job as displayed here went beyond what was expected. At every turn it seems they were more intent on finding a way to blame Sullenberger than to find out what actually happened.With each question posed to Sullenberger the clarity of what actually happened comes into question. Not just in the minds of those asking the questions but in Sully's mind as well. Did he make a mistake? Could he have landed at LaGuardia or Teterboro instead? Was landing on the water the safest route possible? The movie moves back and forth in time from the questioning faced by both pilots to their moments alone trying to recall exactly what happened. Time flows freely here and in such a way as to not be confusing. We're taken back to the passengers boarding and get a glimpse at just who these people were in snippets. We see both pilots going through the day to day work of making sure they're ready for takeoff. We see them dealing with the issues that cause the problems that day, a bird strike in mid-air. And we see why Sullenberger made the choice he did and discover if it was the right one or not.Webster defines the word hero as ""a person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities"". Chesley Sullenberger qualifies on all of these counts. His is a name that should not be forgotten. He didn't act out of self-promotion, he didn't do what he did to avoid getting in trouble, he did what he did to save lives, to serve his fellow man. These are qualities that seem lacking in many of those we call hero these days.The movie is so well crafted that you never find yourself checking the time to see how much longer it will go on and by the time the final credits roll you don't feel like it should last longer. The story is so well told it's enough, not too little or too much. It flows seamlessly even when going back and forth in time. Eastwood shows why he's such a gifted director here. Not only does he show what a hero Sullenberger was he shows how the city of New York were a part of the story as well.While watching the film I was reminded of how far Tom Hanks has come. First fame for him was as a man dressed in drag to save money on a TV series and now he's among the finest actors of our time. I'd place him in the top five any day of the week. He rarely claims the limelight or use his celebrity status to push political agendas. Instead he works and does so incredibly well. Those abilities are on display here as he uses the most subtle of maneuvers to present a man forced into the role of hero publicly but who did so for his own reasons.With so many movies to choose from these days my biggest fear is that this one will be overlooked. I noticed it was easily available at the local Redbox's while other big name fare wasn't. While those movies are few and worth watching I hope this one doesn't disappear soon. It's a movie that everyone should see. And stick around for the credits as a reunion of Sullenberger and the passengers is in the credits as well. This is what a real hero looks like."
" 'It's not a crash, it was a forced water landing.'
",-0.1882,0.6542,2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"Topical docudramas don't always work; this one does. This once in a lifetime incident was reported in the book Brace for Impact: The Chesley B. Sullenberger Story (2010) by Chelsey Sully Sullenberger, well adapted for the screen by Todd Komarnicki, and adroitly directed by Clint Eastwood. The manner of telling the story on film is at times a bit disconcerting because of the manner in which the screenplay jolts between after the event, dreams by Sully, and the even and the final 'trial'. But in the end it works – largely in part due to the reliable Tom Hanks as assisted by Aaron Eckhart.Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), with his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), made aviation history on January 15th, 2009 when he successfully landed an Airbus A320 flight 1549 on the Hudson River instead of the intended LaGuardia Airport: a flock of birds flew into the engines, disabling and breaking them. 155 people walked off the plane that day. However, even as Sully was being heralded as a hero by the survivors and the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career. Further tension is provided by Sully's frightened telephone calls with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney). A fine cast of actors hold the hearings in which Sully defends is actions and proves his heroism.This is a solid film, ell photographed and acted and directed and brings to the public eye the action of a living hero. It is inspirational – especially today."
" Tom and Clint make a great pair
",0.6249,0.9141,2017-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Tom Hanks gave another stellar performance. He didn't have to portray a dying AIDS patient or a mentally handicapped person for this one, he just needed to be a pilot. He gave an understated and honest performance that had me completely bought in. This isn't a linear story; Eastwood hops around the time line quite a bit. Flashbacks are so long you forget events aren't happening in real-time. When I first heard this was being turned into a movie I honestly didn't know how they would make it. It turns out there was a lot more to it than just the crash. If Hanks doesn't get a nomination for this, I at least hope best supporting actor goes to Aaron Eckhart.......'s mustache because that was on point!"
" Fact is less interesting than Fiction
",0.3415,-0.5511,2017-02-10 00:00:00,6,"""Spoilers"" in this review.I put the word spoilers in quotes for two reasons. First, of course, we all know about this high profile incident and the outcome. Second, the other 'revelation' that occurs in the third act never actually occurred in reality. The filmmakers explained when the movie came out that because there was no controversy to wrap the story around, they made one up. This kind of reminds me of my reaction to ""Argo"". One reason why the audience will invest their time into a movie is knowing that the stakes are real. ""Sully"" shows that sometimes fact is not as exciting as fiction. So I have the same reaction to ""Argo"", which is ""why am I watching a fake story?"" In this case you get into groan territory as Sully faces a review board. Characters playing aviation officials look accusatory as they confront him with the idea he should have tried to land the plane at a runway close by. All be damned that he successfully saved all the passengers, he should have saved the plane! Spoiler Sully acts like John Wayne and publicly shames all the officials as he points out that human reaction time was not factored in. The hang dog reaction on the officials faces is so over-the-top it feels like a farce. This ""oh we feel so terrible, let me lick your toes"" response felt just dumb. Spoiler finishedEastwood handled the material otherwise very appropriately. Finding momentum by reviewing the moment via flight control and passengers midway through the film (instead having it as the finale) helped feed the story. Otherwise, we all know that the pilot was a hero, had no dark secrets, and was completely exonerated. Compare that to the Academy nominated ""Flight"". This fictional story was wrapped around a hero pilot that had dark secrets. That fictional story also allowed for a more dramatic crash landing. To 'sully' the material with any fictional personal problems or what not (wife can't deal with, other crew members think the captain is taking all the credit) would have turned this fact-based movie into something it wasn't. Sully the character is a straight arrow, nothing to hide. Nothing terribly exciting either. Thankfully Eastwood also knows the limitations of the material, with the film clocking in at a thankful 96 minutes. I suppose the big draw to see this on the big screen was to watch the special effects sequences of the miraculous water landing. I chose to wait until the DVD came out because I felt I might not be invested in this movie beyond the special effects. Tom Hanks is always charismatic, even more his sidekick Aaron Eckhart (proudly sporting a 70's moustache). His co-pilot character is allowed to be more engaging. I expect my reaction if I saw this in a theatre would be neutral, not a waste of money but not an award winner. I usually declare ""wait for the DVD"", however I am writing this review long after the big screen release, and the new phrase needs to change to ""wait for DVD/On Demand"" for this day and age."
" Flawed, but inspiring nonetheless
",0.5719,-0.3711,2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Whether or not Captin Sullenberger was genuinely an American hero has been a much discussed topic ever since January 15, 2009. Some say what we did was incredible and certainly heroic, others will argue that he was simply doing his job (by the sounds of it he may even argue for the latter himself). Regardless of where you stand, no one could argue that he did his job fantastically well that day.'Sully' is actually a film I can relate to on a personal level. I was a flight attendant for a couple of years and during my time we had a flight that was showing signals of a possible internal fire. We had to return to the nearest airport and I (as the sole flight attendant on board) had to evacuate 50 passengers mid-runway. I can confirm that that is a harrowing experience that sticks with you for a long time afterwards. What these people did, both the pilots and flight attendants, will never be easy for them to forget.The film itself isn't perfect. The biggest flaw it has it that structurally it's a bit of a mess. A 3 minute event doesn't exactly lend itself to a film. The scenes of the actual crash are brilliant. They're captivating to watch and are filmed brilliantly. It's the filler that doesn't really sit that well. The board room scenes feel overacted and unnecessarily harsh. They are purely that way to add some conflict to the story. It was needed, but it feels far from natural.'Sully' is a film that could have been a complete mess without a competent director. Luckily, Clint Eastwood was up the task. I imagine his job was more a case of paving over the cracks in the script than anything else. He did his job effectively though and the end result is a good, if somewhat forgettable, tribute to some people who did their job fantastically on that particular day."
" Just the story - no more, no less
",-0.5267,0.991,2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"I've become a big fan of Clint Eastwood when it comes to directing quality movies. One thing that I especially like is that Eastwoods movies tend to have a clear purpose - a story they want to tell. Technically the production is top notch, everything feels like it's in the right place and nothing important is missing. Just above one and half hours is perfect run time for this movie. It gives us enough back story, the actual incident and an agreeable ending.This is a pattern that works particularly well in stories revolving around real world incidents. I wanted to know about Sully, the actual incident and the dispute between Sully and insurance companies. I got exactly that without any unnecessary relationship drama.When it comes to acting Tom Hanks always brings his A-game on. I can't remember a single Tom Hanks movie that I wasn't even somewhat interested in. Not only is Hanks able to carry less interesting movies he can make good movies even better. Tom Hanks is Sully, but boy does seeing him so gray make me feel old all of a sudden.Another stellar performance comes from Aaron Eckhart as Sullys co- pilot Jeff Skiles. Eckhart and Hanks have a very good chemistry and balance each other out. Sully being the more serious one of the two while Skiles brings in some much needed humour.Storywise the movie moves along with a rather nice pace. It takes quite a while to get to the actual incident but everything about it is filmed beautifully and - what I can only believe - true to the original accident. The movie has plenty of side characters that you feel for even with a short introduction.""Sully"" is a technically flawless movie that gives a great dramatization of a real world incident that shook the World eight years ago. It is not a movie that shines particularly on any area, yet there is nothing I could think that should've been done differently. It captures precisely what it aims to do and that is to tell a good story that touches your heart as it is."
" Simple heroism, shown wonderfully
",0.8271,0.8225,2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"It is strange, that in a movie-going landscape where it seems like every movie is at least two and a half hours, to see a movie that leaves you wanting more. ""Sully"" wastes NO time in getting started with one of the most attention-grabbing opening scenes I've ever witnessed, and when it ends, it's over, with no superfluous denouement.""Sully"" is also a rare movie that uses special effects when they are actually necessary. This is part of what makes them so attention grabbing. You are seeing what did happen and what could have happened, not just where the budget went.If there is a wrong note in the movie, it's Sully's wife, played by Laura Linney, an immensely gifted actress given nothing to do here but look concerned. You recognise her as an uninteresting staple character immediately: the realisation that it is Linney comes as a shock.""Sully"" does boast a tremendous performance from Hanks, however. He, like the director Clint Eastwood, is more than willing to take a step back and let the simple heroism of the story come to the fore."
" A missed opportunity
",0.1531,0.9883,2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"Clint Eastwood has nothing to prove to anyone anymore. Having won a handful of Oscars and directed two Best Picture winners, we are only so lucky to have such an esteemed veteran behind the camera (he just turned 86 this past year). His repertoire covers a wide range of subject and setting, from westerns to historical pictures to modern fiction. He has hit's and misses. It's unfortunate that such an inspiring story as the Miracle on the Hudson could wind up so flat on the big screen.It wasn't but a few years ago, and I know we all know the story - how Captain Sullenburger successfully ditched his US Airways flight into the river just outside of Manhattan and miraculously kept everyone on board alive and well. It was a 1 in a million landing, all the more spectacular and alarming for taking place so close to Ground Zero. The world proclaimed him a hero, but (you guessed it) some had initial doubts.The story itself follows Sully in the immediate aftermath of the landing, when he and his copilot (Aaron Echart as Jeff Skiles) are hotel-bound while a hearing is underway to investigate the cause of the crash. Sully frequently calls his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney) at home to assure her that he is okay and will be home soon. The hearings proceed simultaneous to an endless barrage of news coverage and late night appearances. In the same day, Sully met with both Katie Couric and David Letterman.The trailer promised a somewhat suspenseful story with a crash scene that would rival that of the movie ""Flight."" We flash back several times in the film to the actual incident, when birds struck both engines and caused the plane to lose forward thrust. The entire incident was so quick (200 seconds or so) that Eastwood devotes several scenes to show the crash in it's entirety from various perspectives. It's a Rashomon approach in many ways, and the effect is a powerful testament to the quick wits of not only Sully but the flight crew and the Coast Guard and even passersby watching a plane descend into the frigid Hudson River in disbelief.Tom Hanks, of course, plays the titular character. He is barely there, so steadfast in his beliefs and quiet in his doubts, I don't think any other man would be as suited for the role. One would think that this would be a sure bet for an Oscar nomination (and well overdue: Hanks hasn't been nominated since Cast Away in 2000) but his performance is as muted and subtle as anything he has done. From crash to court hearings, Sully is played as a man you understand to be a real hero. He is quiet, determined, scared of being wrong but persistent when he knows he is right.The villains (the National Transportation Safety Board who scrutinize his every move) are often laughable and there for the obvious reason of creating more cinematic drama. I don't know how factual the film is in regards to the final scenes, but we are led to believe that Sully is on the cusp of being fired for having endangered the lives of everyone on board. Flight simulations (and we see no less than 4 entire flight simulation sequences, mind you) prove that the plane could have landed safely at LaGuardia, and it comes down to a simple speech by Sully in which human error ultimately would have made landing on a runway impossible.When the movie is good, it's good, but when it's not, it's apparent. There are many sequences of PTSD and such from Sully's perspective that feel taped on and hasty. A dream sequence in which Katie Couric presents a news story about Sully being a fraud is forced to say the least. Clint Eastwood has never been a meticulous director known for precision edits or immaculate framing. Sully simply feels like a rough cut that required a few more trims to make it feel concise. Hanks is great, of course, and the story is inspiring. The film itself leaves a bit to be desired. Still, for a man closer to 90 years old in age, I doubt you will find a more assured director working today."
" Should have stuck more to the real story
",-0.25,0.8684,2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"The crash/rescue scenes were very moving, but the rest of the film wasted too much time on repetitive depictions of Sully's feelings in the aftermath (just one scene would have been enough to tell us that he's uncomfortable with the attention) and the completely made-up witch hunt by the authorities.There was a lot of actual heroism among the passengers, and it would have been much better to depict that. One young man, for example, went back down the aisle to help the woman with a baby, and he pretty much carried them to the exit when she fainted in his arms. Plus Laura Linney was utterly wasted as Sully's wife. She's far too good an actress to just perform endless variations of ""Oh my darling, you did everything you could."""
" An ironical uneventful crash landing
",-0.4019,0.1096,2017-02-01 00:00:00,4,"Clint Eastwood apparently felt the need to adapt the events of the Miracle on The Hudson into a feature film. After watching it, you might just wonder if you find that need too. Barely clocking in at 90 minutes, Eastwood prosaically rushes and stifles whatever material there is to transpose and work with, as Tom Hanks, playing another Tom Hanks' default role (who else could have played it anyway), does whatever he can with a by-the-numbers basic ""script"". When in such a short film a director and a screenwriter are required to repeatedly relapse into dream sequences of the could-had-been, you know you're in for a (figurative) crash landing. In the end Sully is nothing more than harmless, forgettable and ironically uneventful. If that's a capital cinema crime, I can't decide but I do know that I'm not part of the audience Eastwood looked to appeal."
" Another One For Tom Hanks!
",0.0,0.9856,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Tom Hanks is great in this biopic of Chesley Sullenberger, the hero pilot who landed his jet in the Hudson River after it was damaged, saving the lives of every passenger and crew aboard. This is a great piece of work directed by Clint Eastwood illustrating that the one doing the actual job sometimes knows what's best. This is probably one of the best films of the year with a screen play that is magnificent and the cast couldn't have been better. I knew this was going to be a good film before going into it because of the talent of Tom Hanks and I knew this film was going to be kept simple without any extra irrelevant Hollywood fillers added to it. ""Sully"" is definitely worth the watch."
" A crackling performance by Tom Hanks dealing a powerful incident with operational efficiency
",0.6486,0.9144,2017-01-26 00:00:00,7,"It is difficult to forget the positivity and heartwarming end to some powerful events that we come across in our daily life or through the media and 'Sully' covers one such event which consoled the world that not every bad incident would end in a tragedy. While the incident is still powerfully etched in our minds due to its coverage, this movie tries to cover the human aspect and behind-the-scenes events from the perspective of the man who made this possible - Captain Chesley Sullenberger.On 15th January, 2009 US Airways Flight 1549 (Airbus 320-214) took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport with the experienced and sure-handed Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) at the helm along with his First Officer Jeffrey B. Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). Three minutes into take-off, the flight was hit by a flock of Canada geese leading to the shutdown of its engines and flight losing its thrust. Using all his experience as a flight safety expert, glider pilot as well as his instincts, Sully landed the plane on the River Hudson without any casualties despite instructions to return to the source airport or the other nearby options. An inquiry was ordered by NTSB whose initial evaluation through flight simulators suggested that it would have been possible for the flight to have made it back to LaGuardia airport. With evidence mounting against him, can Sully come out of this serious accusation of endangering lives of all the passengers and crew aboard the flight.It is impossible to not draw comparisons with a similarly themed Robert Zemeckis's movie 'Flight' which also deals with a freak and impossible crash landing followed by an investigation. The major difference apart from one being fiction is the melodrama quotient. 'Sully' deals the entire episode with operational efficiency without bringing in emotion where it was not necessary. The surprising and overwhelming nature of the situation that doesn't have a precedence is well countered by the experience, maturity and confidence of the Captain who is a veteran of thousands of flight hours and air-crash investigations - aptly portrayed by Tom Hanks. The way Sully is shown to conduct himself in this extraordinary situation makes you respect the real man even more. While the focus is mostly on Sully, Aaron Eckhart shows his quality by making his presence felt without actually having to force it in. One more interesting segment is how Sully deals with the situation on the personal front with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney) while speculating possible outcomes from the impending investigation.Apart from the leads, Anna Gunn (Breaking Bad fame) also gives a nuanced performance as Elizabeth Davis, an NTSB panel member who was heading the investigation. Rest of the cast gives an apt performance despite just being in the background. Coming to the technical departments - the visual effects of the crash looks natural, the screenplay makes the events more interesting by non-linear flip-flopping between the incident and the investigation. However the final hearing of the investigation is hurried to bring the revelations hastily in a day which in reality would have taken weeks to conclude. Despite its short runtime, it sometimes felt repetitive and dragging occasionally. Age seems to be just a number for director Clint Eastwood who has maintained relevance and quality in his second innings (last 10-15 years) which is a stark contrast of the genre for which he was a superstar for decades previously.A crackling performance by Tom Hanks dealing a powerful incident with operational efficiency."
" I'd ride with 'Sully' anytime.
",0.0,0.9935,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"We all remember what took place in New York on January 15th, 2009. Pilots Captain Chelsey 'Sully' Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles took an Airbus A320 with 155 passengers aboard out of LaGuardia Airport to their destination. However, a couple of minutes after takeoff, a freak accident with a flock of birds took out both engines of the airplane, leaving the Airbus without any power and no airport immediately in range to land. Making a calculated decision to save everyone's life, Sully was forced to land the plane in the very cold waters of the Hudson River.Nobody was seriously hurt or injured and everyone survived and escaped the sinking plane with Sully and Skiles being the last off the plane, making sure everyone was safely rescued. Sully became a national and world hero for his calm and collected demeanor and quick thinking to save everyone's life. That actually happened almost eight years ago. A character in the film says, ""It's been a while since New York had news this good, especially with airplane in it"", which is the overall feel of the film. Directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and a river of cameos, this docu-drama is a feel good film about a man who emulates the golden age of Hollywood heroes in film, but in real life in this case. Captain Sully is ""just doing his job"", and doesn't see himself as a hero.He is good at his job, is a good family man, and always does the right thing, which is something we used to see in the old Hollywood films. He is always calm, collected, and polite, no matter the issue or obstacle, which is one of the main reasons this true story turned out the way it did. And that is how Eastwood tells this story. 'Sully' has a lot of similarities tot he Denzel Washington film 'Flight', in that both films have a forced airplane landing shortly after takeoff where there are a ton of survivors. Both films have investigations into the pilots on their decisions, but 'Sully' is basically the complete opposite of 'Flight' in that Denzel's character was dealing with some strong personal issues after the first ten minutes of the film where we see the forced landing.In 'Sully', Captain Sullenberger (Hanks) is basically the perfect man and we don't have to see him deal with his demons, other than his long jogs at night around Mnahattan, as the press hounds him and his family at home about being a hero, as well as if his decisions were the right ones. This is Eastwood's shortest film, running in at 96 minutes. The story is straight and to the point and doesn't lollygag with any side tangents. Eastwood shows us the forced water landing in the Hudson twice from different perspectives throughout the film, which gives the movie a great pace, instead of showing the whole thing in the first few minutes, followed by 85 minutes of an investigation.The forced landing sequences itself are shot very well with every detail getting on screen. The suspense and tension are at an all-time high, even though you know everything and everyone turn out okay. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are both excellent in their roles and every cameo does a great job too. Eastwood shows again that he is a master at his craft and is showing no sign of slowing down with 'Sully'. Stay tuned for the credits for a recent reunion with the real Sullenberger and survivors that might call on some tears.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Like watching paint dry.
",0.3612,0.5859,2017-01-21 00:00:00,4,"There could possibly be two miracles in this film, first will be the miracle on the Hudson and the second will be your ability to watch it all the way to the end. What a boring film, not to take away from Sully's amazing feat but this would have been much more suited to a short 10min film than a feature. A film filled with padding to stretch it to feature length. Let's watch Sully go for a jog, let's watch Sully sit in a hotel room and think, let's watch Sully sit in a bar. The fact that you watch the landing in full twice really shows the amount of scraping necessary to get it over the line. Tedious."
" Fantasy wins over fact.
",0.5719,-0.4753,2017-01-20 00:00:00,4,Eastwood takes an amazing incident but one from which he cannot make a film without wildly diverging from the facts. Sully is made a persecuted hero as if it was a Spaghetti Western (who was the director again?). The post-crash incident investigation was a complete distortion but necessary to make a story. I really dislike filmmakers playing fast and loose with real life events without any acknowledgement. An aircraft incident investigation is just not carried on as described. But I guess most people don't care as long as they leave the cinema warm and fuzzy. The crash re-creation sequences were incredibly well done though and reclaimed the film.

",0.4019,0.9432,2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"This is not exactly the kind of film you get excited by the prospect of going to see; it's basically a dramatic documentary. However, it's directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Tom Hanks, so that's normally enough to warrant a look.The film is about an incident in 2009 where a pilot had to make a water-landing on the Hudson River after both of his engines gave out. The film shows us what happened during the flight (from multiple points-of-view), as well as the investigation afterwards.If you like films like Apollo 13, then you'll probably enjoy this too (not just because of the Tom Hanks connection). I don't have a lot to say about it other than I found it reasonably enjoyable.

" Good depiction of heroism
",0.7717,0.994,2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"Sully features a strong performance by Tom Hanks as the Captain of a fateful US Airways flight that skirted death by a miraculous successful water landing in the Hudson River after taking off from Laguardia airport in NYC. This reminded me a bit of the fictitious movie Flight, where the pilot did something heroic, then was questioned every which way about why it happened. In this case, why could you not get back safely to an airport.We know the ending of the event, but Sully gives you a behind the scenes feeler into what happened afterwards.The weakness of the film is that there was that one point (the takeoff incident) that was the focus, nothing else. Eastwood as director tried to bring in other events in Sully's life about his love of flying, his youth, his relationship with his wife, but those added really very little to the story. I would have liked to see more info about the co-pilot, excellently played by Aaron Eckhert. That might have helped support the story better. But maybe there was no drama there to build on. Eastwood tried to build some supporting drama, but his only real focus was the crew's reaction after the poop hit the fans, literally. That left very little to excite the viewer.The film takes some swipes at bureaucracy, and the often times idiocy of people who were not there taking judgment. It's unclear if the FAA questioned ANY of the passengers who had survived, or whether they just investigated based on black box data.The flight scenes are terrifically realistic, and the heroism of the entire crew under fire was just incredible. I recommend Sully as a very good depiction of a real life event. It's a film that is worth seeing in spite of the short focus of the plot. Enjoy."

What Tom Hanks (Sully), said at the last meeting in the movie was amazing:""You are looking for human error, than make a human!""The whole directing was amazing, the way they slowly showed the whole water landing and how we actually became familiar with the people inside the plain fascinated me.Tom Hanks? He was just amazing. He played so well his role, at some point I forgot I was watching a movie.

" A stand out factual movie about a stand up guy
",0.0,0.6679,2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"This is based on the true incident where a disabled plane full of passengers was landed on the Hudson River by Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. Because a flock of birds disabled the engines by flying into it. And the core of the story revolves around if Sully is really a hero when it came to his decision making. Or is there other factors that play a part in this, which would make his decision at that moment to be the wrong choice. Maybe he is a scapegoat and the fall guy to point the finger at so companies wouldn't have to take full responsibility for the damages. Now what I liked about this movie is how Clint Eastwood didn't try to make a pretentious and over dramatic movie. But just show the facts and what Sully was going through during before, during and after the accident. The most interesting parts was during the investigation after the Hudson landing. And the inner turmoil and anxiety that Sully was going through. Now Tom Hanks is the actor that really brought the emotions of the pilot in a very engaging manner. Overall, this is one of those movies that is based mostly on facts that the audiences will get the most out of if they care to know about the aftermath.7/10"
" Tom Hanks is just amazing!
",0.6239,0.9619,2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Sully is a true story about Chesley Sullenburger who in January 2009, landed an airplane on the Hudson River in America. Tom Hanks as Sully (Sullenburger) was just an amazing pick. He really makes the audience feel what actually happened that day. Although the film was good, their were some problems throughout the movie.Firstly, their isn't as much action as the trailer proposes. The movie starts with the audience being told what happened, then we see the plane crash. But the crash is only about 4-5 minutes long. And that scene is virtually the only scene with action. Also, everyone knows in advance that everyone on the plane survives so they shouldn't have used so much of the film time on that.The film is only 90 minutes long and I can understand quite well why. Clint Eastwood had nothing else to add to it. The acting of Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are very good and emotional but that's really the only thing that worth the while. The film ends before it even begins. I think that the film shouldn't have ended where it did. Their should have been more after the court case like Sully calling his family to tell them what happened, or something else. But the way they ended it on a a joke wasn't very well prepared or done.To conclude, you can watch this film as its not too bad, I still enjoyed it partially, but don't be too hyped for it or you'll be very, very disappointed."
" Good (76/100)
",0.4404,-0.9922,2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie tells the true story of the airplane pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (played by Tom Hanks), who, in 2009, had to land in the Hudson river after a bird strike that disabled both engines. And though he was able to save everyone on board, people started doubting if he did the right thing and whether or not he could have made it back to the airport.The film starts after the event had already happened and we see the consequences of it both in the media and in Sully's personal life and the actual event is told through flashbacks throughout the movie. One of the complains I heard about this film is that there are too many flashbacks and most of them are not needed. I partially agree with that: they show several clips of the accident always with something more (or less) each time they show it and most of them don't add much to the one showed before, so I think some of these should have been cut. There's another unneeded clip that shows Sully learning how to fly a plane and one showing him in the air-force landing a jet (though it's not needed, this one is pretty cool).I found acting in this movie to be mostly okay. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are both great as the two main leads but the rest of the actors were not that good.Here in Brazil this movie is called ""Sully: The Hero of the Hudson River"" and that basically tells you everything about how the movie want us to see Captain Sully: as a hero, and the ones that are ""agaist"" him: as the villains. And that's my biggest issue with this movie: there is a clear ""right"" side and ""wrong"" side. The people investigating if he did or not the right thing are portrayed as villains and thus we don't ask ourselves if what he did was right or not. I think the film would be much better if we kept asking ourselves who's side is the ""right"" one! That happens briefly in the fist act but it just stops! And the villains are not even good villains they're just blend!Clint Eastwood's direction is really good for the most part; There's one scene that I found it sort of weird: Anna Gunn's character is the only one talking and there's two other people in the frame with her and she's almost out of the frame and every time it cuts back to her it's this exact same angle!Most of the characters, with exception of Tom Hank's and Aaron Eckhart's, I found to be kinda generic though the movie focus is mostly in the main leads. But surprisingly one character that gets too much screen time is the guy from the air traffic control, he has two pointless scenes and he is by far the worst actor in the movie!It has good suspense (mainly in the ending scene) and a good atmosphere, result of the really good cinematography.This film has good acting (for the most part), good atmosphere, cinematography, suspense and it's overall a good movie. Check it out for yourself."
" Great and Moving Movie Despite Inaccuracies...

The man is a hero. But while an excellent movie, I have to take an exception with it.I never got around to seeing this movie while in theaters, so I had to rent it recently. It was interesting to see things from afterwards from the perspective of our hero. Cool and calm when the situation demanded it, but haunted about what might've happened, what he might've done differently. Usually when someone does something positively that's news worthy, that's all we hear about and then the news moves on. No one usually knows how, whatever the situation is/was, effected the individual afterwards.But the exception I have to take is the NTSB being made to be the villain. I mean I guess you have to have a villain for their to be a movie, otherwise what's your hero going to fight or campaign against? The villains role should've been the birds the plane ran into, but their birds, they didn't strike the aircraft out of malice or ill intent. So you've gotta find a villain in order to make your movie. That's the NTSB. The NTSB did it's job, they investigated the accident - looked things over, ran some simulations and agreed with Sully that it was the best outcome. But the movie deviates from Sully's book, from the NTSB's investigation and makes them the villain needlessly.The audience would've been better served with a documentary style piece, but they don't normally translate to big budget films. Guess when the story doesn't fit your intentions, you fudge the story. Which is why I'm giving it a seven out of a ten."

I read here that people find it emotional, are involved etc... but I did not feel any of these sensations, on the contrary ...It doesn't help that some characters (wife / daughters / ...) are so empty...

This movie was so 'by the numbers' I started counting them in order to relieve the boredom.Like the crash landing itself, it was grinding and creaking - only this was during the movie's take off. Such a non-event and nondescript start. At least it lowers your expectations for the rest of the movie to a suitable level. Then jump to the actual event about 20 minutes in, then jump to the Sully's seemingly irrelevant past - if it was relevant then it should have been more consequential.He is a good pilot. We get it. A serious person. We get that too. A boring sort of serious person that you want flying your plane when both engines go. Check. A damn good pilot. We get that too. Over and over... until you wished it was all over and out already. The air safety investigators where flawed, .. oh, .. didn't see that one coming. JeezzZZ ZZzz ... zzZZzzZZzzZZzzWhat's the moral of the story?

But the NTSB would never hire such an asshole as the guy who plays the chief investigator, and they would never get the report on the left engine while sitting in a final public meeting. Also, never would the NTSB accept simulator tests where the operators were allowed several attempts. They are well aware of the stress factor and don't have to be lectured by some film producer. The film makes them look like they had done their first accident investigation.Once again, Hollywood has created prejudice among lay people for the sake of ""good entertainment"".

" Would Have Been a Great 45-Minute Film
",0.6249,0.7867,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Disappointing. By exaggerating the evil of federal agencies & including too many of Sully's ""nightmares"" that could have happened to his flight, Eastwood scratched out a feature-length film of 1 hr. 36 min. The scenes of the actual disaster are wonderful, but you can palpably tell where he's padding-out scenes & scenarios to stretch it out. A little very good movie within a so-so feature-length film. I was worried about this movie when it came out--it had generally good reviews, but I could tell from what I read that Eastwood resorted to what seemed to be flabby scenes, and so I waited till it came out on DVD.... And lo and behold! What I feared turned out to be true. Great in parts, flab in too many others."
" Flight
",0.0,0.974,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Aiming to tell the ""untold story behind the Miracle on the Hudson"", this true story drama from Clint Eastwood documents Chesley Sullenberger's safe landing of a damaged plane on a river and how the National Transportation Safety Board sought to scrutinise his actions rather than celebrate him saving the lives of everyone on board. ""In the end, I'm going be judged on 208 seconds"" laments Sully, played by Tom Hanks here, and this is the most fascinating aspect of the film: the verdict will determine how everyone will always perceive him, all other merits aside. The film only engages in this dilemma occasionally though, and it is only in the final half hour in which the National Transportation Safety Board put Sully on trial that the film takes off. The first hour of is not worthless, but it is certainly uneven. Clint's decision to leave the real crash until midway through works well as it places doubt in our own minds as to what transpired, but since Hanks does not have a deeply flawed character like Denzel Washington in the similarly themed 'Flight', it is only so interesting to watch him wallow in self-doubt. The inclusion of extraneous flashbacks, like a father and two sons almost missing the flight, also feels like a poor attempt to beef the running time up to feature length. Indeed, the story here is slim for a standard length motion picture with (again) none of the plot complexities of 'Flight'. As always, Clint directs the film in a classy manner and if one avoids thinking about the Washington film in the same breath, it is a solidly assembled piece, if one that could have been much more."
" When too much glorification is not a good thing
",0.1516,0.9767,2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"I'm sure that every one of you knows the story behind this film. A passenger plane dies in the air above NYC, and the captain pulls off a tricky save by landing the machine on the Hudson. A great job indeed. And one way too appealing to make a movie about.But it's just too boring to tell a story about a person who did his job right and saved a lot of lives. Or that's what the cinema bosses might be thinking. So let's bring in some less genuine or relevant conflict about the corporate pigs who always aim to blame the little man, or about the confused wife and financial struggle back at home. Yeah, that's so much better, now we can actually root for our guy even more and see that even if you're a hero for the whole nation you still have severe issues to fix. And what would be better than seeing the little man prevail and beat the evil system fair and square for all the world to see?Well, I don't know how exactly it was in reality, but the one created by Clint Eastwood was a bit too cloying to be appealing. Of course, it's impossible to criticize the work of one of the most esteemed actors-turned-director of late, featuring one of the most esteemed actors of the last decades, especially when it is about a true heroic story America could wholeheartedly call its own. So it's just easier to ignore the general lack of a true drama in this film and let yourself be tricked into spending a few bucks to watch something that would at last make you feel proud to be an American. After all, it's not just New York that was in a desperate need of good news, especially those about an airplane.I'm not an American. Still, it's no problem for me to admit that what the real Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger did was extraordinary. What the movie industry did with this story, however, is much farther from 'extraordinary' and much closer to 'sentiment exploiting and money grabbing'. Which of course is a form of art as well, just not as fine and noble as saving lives on board of a plane doing down."
" A Fantastic Examination of A Forced Hero
",0.6369,0.997,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"When I first heard about a film being made about the proclaimed ""Miracle on The Hudson"" I wasn't really sure how much of a watch it was going to be compelling or even an event capable of making into a feature film but after watching the final product I was extremely impressed and I would consider watching this film again. From the first few scenes I quickly realised that Tom Hanks was a fantastic choice for the role of Chelsey Sullenberger he perfectly embodies his reluctance to accept the title that has been hoist upon him and his characters experience as a pilot. In my opinion Aaron Eckhart gives his greatest performance since The Dark Knight like Hanks he embodies his characters experience and knowledge but unlike Hanks he seems more hot headed and light hearted making him the perfect person to stand next to Hanks. As I previously said I was worried about this film being compelling otherwise it could slip into a tedious bore but thankfully it isn't mainly due to the fantastic structuring of this film, the film doesn't open with the plane crash but instead is gradually cut back to and seen from different perspectives and it was the best way to do this film as it gave weight to the situation and its aftermath, I think if it was done in chronological order it would have made the film slow down and drag after that pivotal moment. Clint Eastwood did such a good job of directing this film but it really shows in the plane crash he makes it intense and lifelike. However my biggest issue with Sully is its lack of subtlety in certain places, places such as the flashbacks to Sully's career in it felt extremely on the nose and came across as forced exposition that was already being perfectly covered with the investigation into the crash. Another area that fell flat was Sullys family drama it just wasn't done well and in the end just came across as a series of phone conversations that didn't really add anything to this film. Sully is a fantastic film, definitely one of Eastwoods better efforts, both central performances from Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart at brilliant, it manages to turn this event into a compelling and riveting experience and I easily one of the best Aviator films I've ever seen. 82%/A-"

He killed it as sully.Sthe first act was right in the to the event of the films story but it gets slow a bit into the second act and then near the third act it gets very good and suspenseful. This is an example of a film that has a lot of potential it could have been a 10 out of 10 film it delivers and what you think should but it could have been for suspenseful. This is Clint east woods shortest film and he is still knows how to film great movies because this is a great movie it has great moments and and flaws that make is not as good but in the he end it's great movie watch it it's out now.

",0.0,0.9433,2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,Excellent representation of a true event. The director did a good job of adding drama with lack of action. One wonders if the movie would have had a more lasting impression and viewers would be thinking about movie more if more drama and action was added to the movie. Tom Hanks portrayal of Sully a sincere hard working pilot looks very accurate but may not be his best work. Sully's wife's role is portrayed well with strong presence even though very short. Movie does make one think about Sully's decisions and question if his actions were 100% correct. In order to create lasting impression it may have been better to exaggerated a little.
" Tom Hanks is the revelation of this Clint Eastwood-driven biopic
",0.0,0.9969,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Tom Hanks has soared as one of the most versatile actors in last few decades while Clint Eastwood on the other hand, has contributed as a major icon not only to Hollywood but American entertainment. So it is pretty easy to understand why many would have speculated a product of an actor like Tom Hanks and an ingenious filmmaker like Clint Eastwood. That is where this riveting drama centered on the major 2009 event known as ""The Miracle on The Hudson"" comes into place. Clint Eastwood conducts the astonishing story of commercial pilot Chelsey Sullenberger who made a daunting decision to land an airplane on Lake Hudson following a failure of plane engine, a decision that many would expect lead to tragedy but instead ended with unexpected triumph. A gray-haired Tom Hank stars as pilot Chelsey Sullenberger (nicknamed ""Sully"") in Clint Eastwood's retelling of January 15, 2009 when Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (played by Aaron Eckhart) were forced to make an emergency landing on the Lake Hudson after their plane engine was maliciously destroyed by a flock of geese in the air. When this fearsome stunt miraculously saves the lives of all 155 passengers on board, he is almost instantly held as a hero by the national public. However, Sullenberger also becomes a target of an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board that unexpectedly jeopardizes his career as well as his newly earned reputation.Clint Eastwood has a sense of livelihood in storytelling which he has best exhibited in his previous few entities. This one is almost equally as riveting as you could come to expect from a Clint Eastwood entry, though it follows a slightly odd story structure. This biopic opens with the titular man immediately in the plane in a jarring flashback of the aforementioned disaster, then the story strolls through the aftermath of the harrowing debacle as the man is almost senselessly falls under scrutiny by the National Transportation Safety Board. It is not until around the halfway point when we witness the mid-air catastrophe which is done realistically. With writer Todd Komarnicki providing a hefty hand for the script, the film paints a mesmerizing portrait of the heroism that defined Chelsey Sullenberger on that fateful day while shining clear light on how heroic actions don't always come without a cost. And without the need to villainize the National Board (at least not in an over-the-top way), Eastwood provides us with a sensible look at both legal and psychological repercussions that threaten to tear Sullenberger apart as the person the public deeply admired him as. As the story moves on, Clint Eastwood accomplishes the essential task of pushing depth of the lead character including the psychological aftermath that disturbs his inner being. On top of it all, the real revelation in the mix is Tom Hanks. Now pushing his sixties, Hanks strives with a powerful performance as the spirited lead character, a role that allows him to shine like gold. Though this does not mark the first time Hanks has ignited the role of a real-life tragic figure as he portrayed the titular role in Paul Greengrass's 'Captain Phillips' in 2013, he provides just enough emotional gravitas to make for a memorable role. Even if he doesn't quite pack the same visceral energy he did the 2013 biopic, his performance still demands for admiration.Sully is a riveting biographical drama blooming with the likeliness of Clint Eastwood's solid direction and Tom Hanks' blissful talent in the performance department. It is a moving picture that unfortunately doesn't quite fall in the crowd of Eastwood's most masterful features. But in the end, the film paints a smart, triumphant tribute to the heroic Chelsey Sullenberger, a man that many still admire to this day."

And we think we know what happens to the other plot, the investigation of the crash. So this is a movie without surprises, and is mostly about recreating the events in a moving way.Done.Kudos also go to Tom Hanks, who pulls of a nuanced version of the pilot that seems convincing and sympathetic. A star playing a hero. The re-creation of the crash itself, and of the simulations afterward, are also first rate stuff—gripping, scary stuff.All of this said, it's also true that this is a formula movie. It does little to get to actual depths or surprises. It includes a couple of short dream sequences that are manipulative (for those of us who remember 9/11, at least). It concludes with a two-minute wrap up where everyone says golly and a huge room full of people jot a few things onto pads of paper. And with a very funny joke, which ends the movie with a laugh.Could more have been done? Of course. But then it wouldn't have been a simple re- presentation of the facts. It would have been a creative, original work of art, which this is not.But it's one heck of a story."
" An overall great acted drama about family and the plane crash of 2009
",0.34,0.9794,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Clint Eastwood does it again with a new and excellent acted movie about the Hudson River plane crash of 2009. The main premise of this movie is to make you feel and see the intensity and seriousness of the events of 2009. The acting in this film is top notch Tom Hanks plays Sully (The Pilot) and Aaron Eckhart plays Jeff Skiles (The co-pilot) both do a great job in this movie. Tom Hanks plays a serious emotional role while Aaron Eckhart plays more a humorous and relief role. This movie also does a great job incorporating New York City. It shows numerous shots and great cinematography of New York while also focusing on the problem at hand (the plane crash). It also shows Sully running down the streets of New York and down Time Square. Believe me this movie isn't all about the plane crash, its also about family and friendship. It explores aspects of Sully's life no one probably even knew were going on at the time. This film is also very realistic in which it shows people emotionally distraught after the plane crash and how much the passengers cared about there families. There is one scene in the movie which I thought that there might be a classic Hollywood moment but instead it went a different way and I was happy about that. I absolutely love how the movie showed little mini stories about the passengers and there families throughout the film. There is a sense of fear throughout this movie and that's what makes this film intense at some moments.Issues I had with the film There were very few issues I had with this movie but I thought for starters there were a little too many dream sequences which I wont get into detail about.The feeling of 2009 wasn't really there. There were a couple of shots I could see things like an advertisement for the Revenant on a cab.The movie was a little slow at the beginning. The beginning of the movie sort of moved a little slower than i thought it could have but i understand why it was crucial to put those scenes in the film. Eventually the film does pick back up."
