" Top talent grinding it out
",0.5574,-0.9682,2021-01-25 00:00:00,3,"How can a film with Marion Cottillard, Vincent Cassel, and LÃ©a Seydoux be so nail-gratingly annoying?Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh. I wanted to scream. And not in a good way. Gaspard Ulliel plays Louis, a successful write who returns home after 12 years offing away with almost no communication, to tell his family that he has a terminal illness.
The film is about how his absence, and the family's imagining of him, has affected all of their lives. What it amounts to is an hour and a half of angst and bitterness, whining and hesitation. Ugh.Louis' older brother (Cassel) refusing to feel any joy lest his anger dissipate. His younger sister (Seydoux) has imagined a dream version of Louis she both idolises and resents. His sister-in-law (Cotillard) is the most sympathetic but even she is mistrustful of Louis' return. Rounding out the cast is Nathalie Baye as the family matriarch who turns to Louis to cure the curdled bonds within the family.What grates is the lack of insight into what it was that has caused Louis to leave for so long. The brief flash-back glimpses we get of his pre-leaving-home life seem happy enough, and the horror-show that is his family now has been caused by his absence.
There's something to be explored here about what we owe our family, about the balance we have to strike between honouring the familial bonds, and look gin after ourselves, about needing to get away from toxic situations even if you love the people you leave behind, but the film is not interested in any of that - it wants only to wallow in how horrific the homecoming is. We learn nothing of why Louis is so desperate to stay away; so desperate in fact that he has done nothing more than send postcards with 2 or 3 words on them for years, so desperate that he does not want his mother to know his address. We can throw out guesses; his homosexuality? His artistic temperament? But the film won't so much as glance in that direction. Home is toxic; that's all it wants you to know.The main character is so blank as to be without a character. He is silent for much of the film. Many scenes are shot largely in close-up, rendering everything claustrophobic, but Louis does no more than look sick, and give a wan smile.
An early exchange of looks between Cotillard and Ulliel gave me hope there was some understanding between them that would yield some insight or drama, but nothing.Cassel is asked only to be angry throughout. Seydoux only anxious. Cottilard only nervous. Baye, at least, is asked to do a little more; but even she seems to see her son only as a way to fix her other 2 children.Perhaps there is something to be gleaned here for those whose home life is truly toxic, perhaps this functions as a sort of acknowledgement that sometimes you shouldn't go home again, but for me, this was a grind.This was the first film I have seen written and directed by Xavier Dolan. I would never write anyone off (there's always hope!), but it may be some time before I venture into Dolan's house again."
" Xavier Dolan's most disciplined work
",0.0,0.6597,2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"While imbued with his trademark flamboyance, 'It's Only the End of the World' is definitely Xavier Dolan's most disciplined work, in which narrative and film craft function in dazzling tandem. A bold, tense, stylistically daring melodrama performed with thunderous emotions, and packed with explosive performances shot in claustrophobic close-up."
" disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.8242,2020-05-30 00:00:00,2,"Quite disappointing. this movie combines two ""dreams"" of every gay child. (1) i will die and you all will be sorry. and (2) i will go become famous and you will all realise how wrong you were about me. characters are made of cardboard. so are dialogues. Marion was great. but a very weak movie overall. btw (3) why are they all yelling at each other?"
" True masterpiece in its genre
",0.7845,0.9924,2020-03-28 00:00:00,10,"If you love drama movies in which tension increasingly rises as the movie progresses, this is definitely going to rock your boat like it did mine.It's all dialogistic... though the main character is all but a talker. Therefore, it all relies not only on the others' conversations and forms of expressions, but also on the reserved reactions of the main character (Louis). On top of this, the omniscient narrative makes it all the more effective and troubling.This film should definitely talk to everyone, since each family has its own conflictual history... And this family is no exception.
To me, this is as brilliant as Mommy, and I just love Xavier dolan for his pieces of work as he seems to depict family members' interactions perfectly.What makes this movie well worth watching, is that it'll make your heart beat at various speeds even though the tempo remains mainly the same throughout the movie...
Cherry on the cake is of course the brilliant cast. Vincent Cassel is a genius in portraying this kind of quick-tempered, easy-to-get-triggered family man. His performance works just GREAT with the one of Marion Cotillard playing the role of this slightly submissive, calm and withdrawn family woman.Loved it, and will watch again soon."
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.0176,2020-02-13 00:00:00,1,"I was at least expecting a big plot-twist at the end that will explain the dullness and boriness of this whole movie, and there were none. A complete waste of a movie"
" Dolan does it again
",0.0,-0.9813,2019-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Extremely well acted, filmed and put together. I thought I'd stop and watch again later but never did stop it kept pulling me in. It's a hard film because it is about relationships that hurt, everyone wanting so desperately, no one getting which leaves us the viewer hurt too. Dolan is brilliant in studying these relationships full of need from I killed my mother all the way to Mommy and this. Cinema about pain."
" Dissatisfying.
",-0.5267,-0.4588,2019-08-09 00:00:00,5,"There's a storytelling technique called ""Chekhov's Gun"" that was founded on the principle to encourage a writer's focus on ensuring there are emotional & thematic pay-offs in a novel / script; the basic summary is this -
""Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the 1st chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the 2nd or 3rd chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.""
Thus, crafting an entire story around the concept of a terminally ill writer going home after 12 years to confide in his family the news of his diagnosis, teasing that event & then backtracking after 90 minutes of build up to this pivotal moment... Is a disappointment & I'm left wondering what was the point in making this lacklustre movie if Xavier had no intention of following through & making good on his promises?"
" trackable for acting.
",0.0,0.9914,2019-07-13 00:00:00,6,"Sometimes it was boring. The film had excellent acting. We can not say this movie was very bad or great. But we can say Marion is great. Catherine, the character that impressed me the most. I understand once again; Marion Cotillard is really greatest actress. Nearly she play with her eyes. Watching her beautiful eyes and gloomy look is great delight."
" About a horrible young man that doesn't deserve his story to be told
",-0.5423,0.962,2019-06-29 00:00:00,3,"This movie is about a thoughtless, self-centered man who basically disavows his family for no real reason, other than his own disinterest in his family. He's gay, but that has absolutely no real meaning or merit in this movie. I thought perhaps this was why this young man left home with minimal contact for 12 years, not coming home for any reason, birthdays, holidays, even his own brother's wedding, but not even close. His family wants to know him, cares about him, wants to take care of him, be involved, even impress him. Throughout the movie it shows them trying to get to know him, make an effort and no they aren't perfect, but noone is. His sister reaches out to him, telling him details about her life, questioning him about his. His brother's wife tries to share intimate details about her kids and their lives. His mother shares a moment with him telling him to try to reach out to his family, they need him, even if it's a lie. She loves her son even though she knows what kind of person he is. And his brother, forever angry at him because he knows what kind of person his brother is and he lashes out at his sister and wife because he doesn't want them to get hurt by trying to get to know him. So at the end this young man can't even show a simple kindness to his family by even telling them he is dying. He is having dessert and he tells everyone all the lies his mother wants him to. They're all touched and having a moment and then he says he needs to leave and his brother hears the truth and he wants his brother gone and not leaving a trail of heartache behind, even though the trail is already made. Everyone runs off to their own corner, and he leaves, walking out of their lives forever not bothering to even try to get to know his family or let them know him.
This is a movie about a character that doesn't deserve to have his story told. Everyone has normal family awkwardness and to think you're better than your ""dysfunctional"" family is trying to place yourself on a pedestal. Everyone has their own demons to deal with and yes sometimes family can be a hard pill to swallow, but this family wasn't anymore dysfunctional than most and didn't deserve his attitude towards them."
" A wonderful monologue of unsaid things
",0.5719,-0.8979,2019-06-12 00:00:00,10,"A thirty-year-old writer exiled away from his relatives for twelve years, Louis, now condemned by the disease, decided to return to the tracks of this abandonment, which he is responsible or the victim.
After this infinite time spent fleeing the family home, his return resuscitates the heart of a dysfunctional family where the Prodigal Son soon becomes a catalyst of overflowing emotions, impossible to repress.Xavier Dolan then portrays, through a series of monologues and heated exchanges, the impossible understanding of a family failing to reveal some truths.
It is then the looks and the silences, as well as the introspective parentheses offered to Louis, which will end up expressing, in hollows, all the unsaid, the remorse and the nostalgia without sinking into a disturbing pathos and a collective hysteria of bad taste."
" Irritating stage play
",-0.1531,0.4886,2019-05-12 00:00:00,5,"More like a stage play than a movie, about an extremely unlikable family. I wouldn't want to spend more than one minute in the company of any of them. All they do is shout at each other. I'm not surprised that Louis never visited them. Whether you watch this to the end or not depends on your tolerance for screaming idiots. My advice is ... don't."
" Everybody's drama is understandable, just not touching at all
",0.0,0.9659,2019-03-11 00:00:00,6,"Dolan's Mommy (2014) shattered me to pieces, so I was expecting something similar to happen, but nah.
In the hope that maybe this last time something will change, a guy tries to announce to his estranged family that he's dying. Everyone stays absorbed in their own spectacle though, so we only get the chance to see how he supposedly has influenced the lives of the others.
A great idea actually, which reminded me a bit of Lanthimos' Alps, but the execution left me emotionless. The monologues are truly awkward and even though I understand that their purpose is to underline that everybody cares only about themselves, I still think the message could be conveyed more naturally. Moreover, no one is so self aware, not even the French speakers.
I like how he gradually deteriorates during the ""happy"" family reunion though; it's like he's sick from the very negligence of his relatives and the bigger it gets, the sicker he looks.
Everybody else's drama is also very understandable, just not touching at all. Maybe because I too do care only about myself. Hm. Food for thought."
" Did I miss something?
",-0.1531,-0.9865,2019-01-13 00:00:00,3,"Spent the whole film waiting for Louis to tell his family of his impending death. This never actually happened as even after 12 years apart he was unexplainably still terrified of them. They clearly had problems but it seems they were by no means bad people. I also couldnt sympathise with Louis as on the rare occasions he spoke, what he said was mostly cryptic and pretentious nonsense. The film was frustrating and tiring to watch as all the characters basically spent the whole time pushing each others buttons. I just thought the film was trying to manipulate my emotions by randomly mixing hypertense and nostalgic scenes together. The last scene was a ridiculous spectical caused by Louis' mystical communication that caused the whole family exploded in chaos and confusion. Overall, the films portrayal of this family was unnecessary over the top nonsense."
" Nathalie Baye shines
",0.0,0.8225,2018-07-18 00:00:00,7,"Juste la fin du monde is a play that enjoyed a great deal of success in the 1990's while the AIDS epidemic was still raging. A mother and her two sons and daughter settle down to a long day of anger and recrimination as her eldest son Louis returns to the family home after a long absence. So long an absence that he doesn't recognize his sister-in-law Catherine, while his brother sulks and spouts insults towards everyone. The film version makes what I believe is a grave error in casting: Vincent Cassel, 50ish, plays Antoine who is the elder brother here. Since Cassel is almost 20 years older than Gaspard Ulliel (Louis), and since the first born son is usually the one favoured by his mother, it doesn't make much sense to have Antoine bitching about his brother's supposed advantages in life. Louis should be the one vehemently protesting the raw deal he got in life.If birth order is of no concern to you, I'd like to say that Nathalie Baye gives another superb performance as the mother. She's a gold standard now among French actresses. Lea Seydoux does well as the confused, lonely Suzanne. Cassel and Ulliel do the best they can with their parts."
" Nothng really happens but it's a movie you can't forget
",0.2498,-0.367,2018-05-18 00:00:00,5,"I really don't know what's all the fuss about especially that it was a box office. In my opinion, it's not meant for everyone to watch. Not everyone would enjoy a film discussing an unpleasant social phenomena that's taking over modern societies. I was hoping for something to happen all through the movie and that what kept me watching it to the end. Nothing's happened and that was the good part. All the characters feel lonely and can't really communicate, including the protagonist."
" Good but just barely
",0.2382,0.9105,2018-05-12 00:00:00,7,"In the 1990s, Louis (Gaspard Ullilel) is a gay man in his thirties who is a successful playwright in Paris. After a long absence from his family, he returns to the small town where he grew up in order to tell them of a serious health situation. Once there, past family dysfunction is brought to the surface again. The film is based on the play by Jean-Luc Lagarce.The relatives greeting Louis are his mother (Nathalie Baye), his older brother (Vincent Cassel), his brother's wife (Marion Cotillard) whom he is meeting for the first time, and his much younger sister (LÃ©a Seydoux) who was a child when he last saw her. The best scenes are when Louis is one-on-one with each of the women. Among them, there is genuine awkwardness that tries, not always successfully, to hide the feelings of abandonment due to Louis' absence.The scene between Louis and his brother Antoine, however, is not so successful. Antoine is in a constant fit of rage and resentment. While Cassel plays the part well (though rather miscast as he is eighteen years older than Ulliel), the characterization feels incomplete.It's easy to compare Antoine to the Eddie Maresan character in ""Happy Go-Lucky"". But while each are enraged by life, the angry character is more easily understood in ""Happy Go-Lucky"" than in this film.In the beginning, one might have thought that Louis's being gay was the reason for his estrangement but the family seems okay about this. There's no indication of past or present homophobia. It's most likely the bad relations, especially those of his brother, that would probably cause anyone to flee.There is much to ponder in this film and it is very well acted by a fine cast. It is a good film but could have been much better if the character of Antoine was more explored."
" I LIVED IN THAT HOUSE!
",0.0,-0.2477,2018-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I grew up in a family like that. There was no room for each other and, when striving to make things go well for all, everything was a tattered mess. That is what this family is. We tell secrets to the people with whom we are close: I will never tell my family mine, much less that I am dying! He got it right!
I can see people with various mental issues seeing this and, well, it will trigger a lot of things that will not be good for them. Maybe a ""trigger"" warning for them would be worthwhile . . . . ."
" Hugely Disappointing
",-0.5413,-0.9717,2017-11-09 00:00:00,4,"I bought this movie very largely on the basis of the IMDb rating of 7.0. I find that, in almost every case, the score on IMDb is almost always very close to the blind score that I give a movie after I've watched it (having forgotten the rating on IMDb). I guess all this shows is that I have quite ""average"" taste in movies.I expected that I would like this movie and, in some respects, I did. The acting was by and large quite excellent, the cinematography was wonderful, every shot being beautifully framed, the script and the dialogue were also excellent. But, here's the thing. Rarely does a movie so badly miss getting to the bloody point.Young Louis came home to tell his family that he was dying of some unspecified disease and amid all the bitching of arguing among his appalling family, he never gets around actually to telling them. I think I can understand this. Given the utter awfulness of his family, especially the maniacal brother Antoine, I think I might have been inclined in the end to give them all the finger and a parting greeting along the lines of ""F**k you all"" but this really didn't work in the context of a movie where so much more was expected.For the record, I expected an emotional about face after Louis told his appalling family that he was dying but we never even got near there.The whole movie was MOST unsatisfying and I'm afraid it's very unlikely that I'll ever bother to watch it again. It'll sit in my collection gathering dust and I'll probably forget I ever watched it in a few months; at least I hope so.Don't waste your time on this one. It wasn't actually all that bad but I have rarely before been so utterly disappointed by any movie.JMV"
" Read Into Expressions, Not Dialog
",0.0,0.9209,2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)The film's plot slowly unpeels like an onion. Where a man returns home to his family after a 12 year absence. There is a brief statement early on about why he decides to return but when or will he find an opportune time to tell his family during his family's constant bickering, snarky comments and yelling? This film is dialog driven but one must read in between the dialog to interpret the true meaning all of which is moderately open to interpretation. It is a slow burn with effective cinematography with long shot holds and communicative music score. So if you are up for a French drama with a family poor at communication yet like to ponder emotional meaning, then this is for you."
" An amazing film
",0.5859,-0.807,2017-10-08 00:00:00,7,"I just watched the Xavier Dolan film: ""Juste la fin du monde"". It is strange one...in the good sense of ""stange""! The main character is a guy who come back home after 12 years absence to announce for his inevitable death to the family. What he is dying from, why he has left home in the first place...so many questions and so little answers. The whole movie has an atmosphere of something ...something from the past. Like a puzzle Dolan gives to the audience piece by piece the parts of the story, and at the end you being left full with questions and with one feeling of inevitability. The family is strange and in the same time so ordinary. The characters are very complicated - they don't know what to say or do, they are wavering over every possible feelings, they are terrified from the reality, they got angry at each other and to the world at the same time, deeply unhappy, each of them stuck into his/ hers personal hell... And actually it is an amazing film. I highly recommend it to all fans of European cinema."
" Subtle but deep - brilliant piece of artwork
",0.7351,0.9344,2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"Watching this movie was like looking into the eyes of the Van Gogh portraits painted during the years right before his death. It is extremely rare for a film to capture emotions that are so subtle but deep, this clearly isn't going to be a mainstream film since not everyone are capable of those feelings. The film reminded me of the limitations and frustrations of the human experience, that those moments of ecstatic happiness from the past often haunts us with sense of loss, even the things which seemed to be insignificant or immaterial at the time brings a nostalgic feeling when we realise we are not immortal. The characters clearly deeply care for each other, but the limitation of their personalities or a life time of habits (the marks of Antonie's hands or how Catherine constantly looks at Antonie from the fear or triggering his anger) leaving them unable to connect or have a full relationship with each other. This reminds me how we are constantly reacting and reflects the limitations of the human expression and relationships. Louis's sensitivity as he tells his brother the details about his feelings as he travels through the airport was a contrast to his brother's reaction, the lack of empathy from Antoine was not deliberate but a fact, it is not hard to see why Louis stayed away from people/place where he was never understood. The irony is they are family. The scene where Louis leans on the mattress where the scent/dust of the mattress triggers a trip down the memory lane was quite special for me. It represented how the sensitive the human mind is and memories are triggered by the most subtle senses but when we take those trips down the memory lane we are all alone instead of an experience shared between two people. Especially when Louis later learns from Antonie that Pierre has passed away. The actors/actresses are absolutely brilliant and without them the art wouldn't be brought to life.The movie left me feeling sad but nevertheless it's a brilliant piece of art work."
" This family saturates me
",0.0,0.4751,2017-07-26 00:00:00,3,"I have finished watching the movie to be able to do the review, just for that, but it is that this film is repetitive, it constantly counts the same and also you can not get empathy with any of the characters.They are all great, since they get what they are supposed to pretend, show an unpleasant family and with which I do not think I could stand almost anyone else in a morning.The problem is that the script is repetitive, it counts the same over and over again. I got bored after a while and I understood the protagonist as soon as I started the film, I did not need so much time to understand him.Neither the camera nor the photograph is beautiful, it has a white and ugly light and we see the actors many times of sword with what we can not see them.If the director does not realize all this, it is that the address is not good. He does not know how to narrate, does not know how to compose, yes, he directs the actors well.The best thing about the film, when the credits come out, is that it's over."

The music, original and non-original, and the way it is used so perfectly. The flash-backs, and the beauty and power in them. The dialogues. That feeling of wanting to say I love you, but I can't stand you - and soon we will never see each other again."
" A mediocre play adapted with the vision of a genius
",0.5267,0.9507,2017-06-05 00:00:00,10,"I read Jean-Luc Lagarce's play ""Juste la fin du monde"" a while back and it didn't really make an impression on me. So I was quite intrigued and just a tiny bit worried when I learned that Xavier Dolan, possibly my favorite contemporary film director, was adapting this to me impenetrable text into a movie.I had confidence in Dolan's genius and was rewarded beyond expectations. The film is as magnificent as anything Dolan has created before. He has said in interviews that at first reading Lagarce's language- also off-putting for me- didn't impress him but that he discovered its power on second random reading. I'm grateful he did and that he has now shared this discovery with his audience with the aid of some truly superb acting performances.The very first scene establishes everything with narration by protagonist Louis (Gaspard Ulliel), a successful author who is flying to see his family for the first time in over a decade. Louis is dying. Dolan hides Ulliel's face with shadowy lightning and a cap as well as utilizes close-ups so extreme you can't get a proper feel of a face. The close focus continues in the following scenes of Louis's family, only to very gradually move away as the film progresses.Greeting Louis are his extravagant mother Martine (Nathalie Baye), his coolly detached younger sister Suzanne (LÃ©a Seydoux), his dominant yet socially awkward older brother Antoine (Vincent Cassel) as well as Antoine's shy, even more socially awkward wife Catherine (Marion Cotillard).Dolan tends to depict extreme personal conflict in his work, uniting his fiercely dramatic, richly colored and always unique visuals with raw scripts that seem to channel Ingmar Bergman's best work. This also occurs in ""Juste la fin du monde"".If you looked at the movie without sound you could mistake it for a regular- if exceptionally well shot and acted- drama about a family uniting with the result of old wounds and conflicts emerging and taking over the scenes. This is indeed what basically happens here, but the dialog, to me so difficult to digest from the pages of a book, makes it all about what is left unsaid. Because even as extreme emotion takes over the characters and bursts out they still can't communicate with each other. Lines that one would expect to convey full, sincere, angry honesty are expressed through awkward, even incomprehensible dialog that only hints at the apparently troubled history of these people.Louis, as mellow and conciliatory as he acts, seems to be a dangerous catalyst for his family, an antigen they all defend their nest against. This is endlessly fascinating and sold so well by the actors, each and every one of them marvelous. The title becomes darkly ironic, as Louis soon seems to find his impending death a minor problem in his severely dysfunctional family. He connects with Catherine, another outsider and someone who he hasn't met before this one day during which the whole film occurs. ""How much time?"" Catherine asks Louis, a question that together with the offhand mention of Louis's first boyfriend having passed away from ""cancer"" establishes the fatal backdrop of the AIDS epidemic.At first glance ""Juste la fin du monde"" might seem like a melodramatic shouting match that emerges unfocused and aimless, but I ultimately find it urgently compelling and even insightful through its sustained aversion to a genuine unmasking of characters.Lagarce wrote the original play in 1990, reportedly to examine his own mortality. He was dying himself at that time and finally succumbed to AIDS in 1994. There is a touching dimension to the script's nightmarish reunion as we sense Louis's need to come full circle, to rediscover his childhood and adolescence, even to assure himself that his already estranged family can survive after he's gone. Death is ever present, and instead of trivializing the personal conflicts it elevates them, because they are if nothing else moments of vitality for people not truly living."
" French Canadian Life Drama
",0.0,0.9637,2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,"This is the latest film from Xavier Dolan who continues to surprise with his very human stories. This time he has gone for an 'A list' of French talent. The story is from the stage play of the same name and is about Louis (Gaspard Ulliel 'A Very Long Engagement') who is a successful writer; he has not been home for twelve years and has now only returned to announce that he is dying â but he does not know how to do it.On arrival at his home he is met by his family, mother, older brother and much younger sister. His brother, Antoine, played by Vincent Cassel is a man who seems to have got more than his fair share of life's anger but has married a shy creature â Catherine â played by Marion Cotillard in a way that she owns the role, it is completely convincing. The whole day is played out in linear format as the characters stumble into each other always seeming to be on the edge of imploding.This is not an easy to watch movie as the tension can be uncomfortable but that makes it a better film for it. This is real 'Arthouse' in that it takes a different path to many that have gone before and is becoming a welcomed trademark of Xavier Dolan.If you liked any of his previous films then you are probably already sold on this, if you are new to him then switch off any expectations and let this film seep into your psyche, it will be worth the effort."
" Good technique, good themes, somewhat boring.
",0.5849,0.9413,2017-03-24 00:00:00,6,"I might have given this a higher rating if I didn't think that in the end, despite good actors, good and somewhat provoking cinematography, it didn't end up being a bit dull, and repetitive.Most of the film is made up of people yelling at each other. this is not pointless yelling though.the movie opens with the main character saying he wishes to kill himself to prove that he can remove master of his own destiny. he wants to tell this to his family. seeing his family, everyone's different reactions - sad and melancholic (the sister who doesn't know him), simply glad (the mother who loves him), angry and lost (the brother who missed him) and not knowing (his brother's wife). he realizes that he is not only master of his own life, but also master of other peoples' lives. it ends with a shot of a bird - bird of freedom - dying. this is of course my interpretation, but I think it's nice. it goes against the usual vision of ""you are never free, because everyone else and everything else impacts you"". here ""you can be free yourself, but other people are under your sphere of control / influence"".Every character is a bit stereotypical, but again, it's with a point, so it's not bad. dialogues weren't bad, and of course the script writing uses the always very nice trick of not giving you much information, leaving you attentive and hungry for details.Nonetheless most of the films remain yelling. a lot of shots are kind of long, and when it came to thinking how much I enjoyed the film, I think I will remember yawning more than thinking. I don't regret seeing this movie at all, but I don't think I would necessarily watch it again."

",0.7096,-0.1627,2017-03-20 00:00:00,4,"Canadian-French wonder kid Xavier Dolan is back with a â surprise! â vitriol-filled family drama. A terminally ill guy (Gaspard Ulliel) returns to his rejected close ones to reveal that he is dying. Also starring, Nathalie Baye, Vincent Cassel and Marion Cotillard. It's based on play (by Jean-Luc Lagarce), so it's mostly these four, in the bitter battle which is called trying to reconnect with the loved ones.I would say that in its current form, it would be pretty interesting 20-30 minute short movie. But it's stretched onto 97 minutes. The makers have cared little about building the mood or letting the text breathe and find it's natural pace, so the story never really becomes watchable.The first about 25 minutes are actually almost unbearable â just fighting and insults. No rhythm or rhyme to this non-stop viciousness, and they don't say almost anything remotely interesting. Which is kind of the point of (this part of the) story, but still wears you down. Be honest and say that it didn't.Essentially, the movie is not about relations at all but a symbolistic overview of accepting one's death â or human being's fear of death, which some would say is our main motivational force behind everything. Every family member represents a different stage of grief which rises from knowing there's no escape from the inevitable. And different parts of the story play the process through.Written like that, it sounds intriguing. And it is, conceptually. But for me, the makers have found just about the most tiresome approach to unravel it. Still, I like the artsy interludes and the end scene.This is the first Dolan movie I've seen, and it certainly arouses interest for his previous work â it's the sixth full-length movie written and directed by him, and the dude is only turning 28 by the end of the month!"
" Emotional Currents Pull in Different Directions; Masterfully Done
",0.1531,0.9896,2017-03-19 00:00:00,9,"Sometimes people are farther away sitting on the couch across from you than they are in a remote forest or city of the world. This is the case for Louis who, after twelve years hidden away in distant places, is retracing steps and returning home to tell his mother and siblings that he is near death. The words do not come easily. There are minefields of unhealed wounds, distorted memories, grudges and bitterness. Emotional currents pull Louis in different directions. The passions of his relatives, both aggressive and passive, are more than he was prepared for. Yet Louis is determined to speak honestly, find forgiveness and become master of his own life. He is like a wild bird inside a building; flying but bewildered and not free.The magic of this film is in the close-ups and the finely paced and nuanced scenes. They are masterfully done. The actors express the emotions of the characters so well in their eyes and faces. Sometimes at critical moments no words are expressed and yet the impact of this silence is immense. Music eases the transitions between scenes and emotions. Arguments pass like storms, replaced by calm. I loved the unexpected and moving conclusion. The film is based on a play and the scenes do not expand very far from one house.Before the film began, a professor provided an introduction for the audience. He babbled on for about ten minutes, was walking off the stage and it was left to a New Yorker to remind everyone that this was the winner of the Grand Prix at Cannes. ""Hello!"" said the New Yorker ""it won the Grand Prix."" Seen at the Miami International Film Festival."
" Another great Dolan's movie
",0.6249,0.882,2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,"I think that we were all afraid a bit about Dolan and his work in the future. First movies that Xavier directed were all about LGBT and their attempt to survive in difficulty called social life. After I've seen this movie I am sure that Dolan will be one of the greatest directors this world has ever had. He tears your heart, than makes you smile, but after all you don't know if you should vomit or spit in your reflection in the mirror.""It's only the end of the world"" is a wonderfully directed and theatrically explained way of interpersonal misunderstanding. I can't help saying that I am overwhelmed by his work in total, but this is really something very special, very sour and full of truth."
" Requires Patience.
",0.0,-0.3404,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I fell for Gaspard Ulliel right in his ""Hannibal Rising"" for his trenchant acting in there despite that being largely an underrated film.Lea Seydoux being a Bond girl was promising too.But when I heard this film is the one that had also won Grand Prix 2016,I couldn't but be more interested.Gaspard Ulliel or Lea Seydoux or the other's,I can't say anyone of them missed anything in their respective parts of acting.And since the plot is of that kind to make you feel disturbed,since it was necessary to blabber to create an environment to delineate and make apparent a simmering yet esoteric frustration of the protagonist,deafening gibberish which has to be sustained throughout the film, from that perspective was relevant.But my point is,that gibberish has not been true or natural gibberish,as it was originally intended by the Director,and that necessarily could not engage or invoke the audience to deliberately sustain disturbance(to feel the appeal of the protagonist more,thematically) as the director might have intended through them and that exposed artificiality or ""for the sake of"" facts of the film.The gibberish could be more real,more substantive and more natural;about so many other necessary chores or subjects of a household that keeps a family engaged,rather than the ""for the sake of ones"" that undermine the film.Disturbance intended through one action but subsequently caused by the failure to perform such action or by different or deviant actions doesn't mean success.The acting is flawless no doubt and the face and expressions of Gaspard have been such as I did expect.Otherwise great,if you can muster the patience.I would rate this as 8 out of 10."
" So disappointed!
",-0.5697,-0.0778,2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"I remained completely unsatisfied by quitting the movie theater because, first, what we all except never come, the ""emotionnal scene"" didn't move me at all, Gaspard Ulliel and Marion Cotillard's characters are so annoying (they can even talk without hesitate, being mistaken, say sorry) and in brief, all the dialogues lead nowhere, they all can't communicate and it's so exasperating! However I was pleasantly surprised by Nathalie Baye who I loved and LÃ©a Seydoux.Well, I understood what Xavier Dolan wanted to show but I didn't like it, and by the way this is an adaptation, so I guess I wouldn't like the book as well."
" I like the actors, I liked the movie
",0.6486,0.9967,2017-02-19 00:00:00,6,"""Juste la fin du monde"" or ""It's Only the End of the World"" is a co-production between France and Canada in the French language. The director here is Canadian filmmaking prodigy Xavier Dolan and it is his newest work. it is probably also the film with the most big names in the cast by him, such as Oscar winner Cotillard, Bond girl Seydoux and Ulliel, Cassel and Baye also have their fare share of Hollywood productions in their bodies of work already. So it is maybe a bit surprising that this film was not received as well as most of Dolan's other works. Or maybe it is not because it frequently doesn't work out when it actually should. Then again, I myself enjoyed these slightly over 90 minutes for the most part. It is the story of what happens when a terminally ill young man comes back to his family and has the intention to tell them about his disease. However, they are more than busy with their very own struggles and conflicts they have with themselves and each other.I personally really like Cassel, Seydoux and Cotillard, so I was looking forward to this film. Given my personal bias there, it's probably a bit underwhelming that I would say it was just a good movie. Baye was fine too, but Ulliel didn't do too much for me. The only scene/moment I quite liked with him is when we see him wink at his brother in the ""Dragostea din tei"" scene. This is also somewhat only scene when the family is in something that can be considered close to a state of harmony and I think this was among the best scenes of the entire movie. It was nice to see the two characters dance so enthusiastically and carelessly before it all went back to drama and destroyed idyll afterward very quickly. I also liked the flashback scene there, certainly more than the one later. The best friend story line, also with the death, felt a bit rushed in and it did not have any real emotional impact as a consequence in my opinion. Cassel probably gives the loudest performance of the movie, but I think he was a good choice for the character. Cotillard gives the most quiet performance and she was convincing too.I think some people may have a problem with this movie because it is really almost always the same from start to finish. The scenes with all five together always result in arguments, tears and screaming and the big final scene is no exception to that and it includes really nothing too different that what we saw before. But to me it wasn't a problem at all, not just because I like the actors, but also because it felt pretty authentic. The tension rises, but why would entirely new things happen. I also think it felt accurate that the protagonist kept silent eventually about his illness. Favorite performance is difficult for me to pick as I really liked everybody except Ulliel. However, I must say that LÃ©a Seydoux looks so stunning right now and is still so extremely desirable, even if she plays a pretty wrecked character. The tattoos sure help matters as well, also due to personal preference. Shame the camera became blurry when she is topless. What a waste. I personally would say that the core plot theme about one character dying also could have left out and it really would not have made too much of a difference, at least for me. Maybe people who won't like the cast as much as I do will not enjoy this one as much, but I think those who like at least one cast member a lot here should check this one out. Finally, the Moby song at the end is a good song, but it did not work half as well in the context like the aforementioned ""Dragostea din tei"". Overall, the good outweighs the bad and this film is worth watching, especially for the really tense final conflict scene. Another strong addition to Dolan's body of work. And I also like films like this one here where the focus is on not too many characters and where there are no forgettable supporting characters. The awards attention may have been slightly too much though, especially at Cannes."
" Dolan's middle-road residing
",0.0,0.9937,2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Canne's 2016 Grand Prize of the Jury winner, Canadian wunderkind Xavier Dolan's sixth feature, IT'S ONLY THE END OF THE WORLD is based on Jean-Luc Lagarce's semi-autobiographical theatrical piece, and its closest reference within Dolan's canon is TOM AT THE FARM (2013), adapted from Michel Marc Bouchard's play, a throbbing drama predominately enclosed within a single household. And this time, Dolan goes even further, not only the story is almost exclusively locked inside a family house with five characters, the time-frame is also condensed just within a few hours (bar some sketchy flashback). In the opening monologue, inside a plane, Louise (Ulliel), a 34-year-old writer, confesses his impending death (from an unspecified disease), and the destination of his trip, to visit his family which he has left 12 years old for the first time. At first, it seems Dolan expunges any signifiers of digital technology to avoid signposting a specific time for the story, it could happen well in early 90s when Lagarce wrote the play, or in current days, but when DRAGOSTEA DIN TEI merrily pops up, the effort dissipates immediately, yet, a more relevant distinction is the once-tabooed homosexuality has taken a back seat in the narrative (dissimilar to TOM AT THE FARM), instead, Dolan archly toys with his opening gambit: Louis is going to drop the bomb onto his kin, and god knows how they will react?In the ensuing over-deliberate familial wrangle, this tantalizing question which is blatantly deployed as a trigger of viewers' curiosity, has ultimately evaded the drama, what Dolan musters is a series of bromide-suffusing tÃªte-Ã -tÃªtes between Louis and his mother Martine (Baye), younger sister Suzanne (Seydoux), elder brother Antoine (Cassel) and Catherine (Cotillard), Antoine's wife, the sister-in-law he has never met hitherto, and at other time, a cacophony of the usual suspects generates on its own, meanwhile Louis remains excruciatingly tight-lipped through and through. A gaunt-looking Gaspard Ulliel gives a commendable performance, straitjacketed in his diction, the character is solely built on affective miens and minute gestures which demands taxing physical effort to pad out the lacunae in Dolan's meditative close-ups (Dolan really loves Ulliel's model- contour and blues-imbued visage) and what's more incredible is Ulliel instills a visceral pang of agony into Louis' perturbed psyche in the face of a massively elliptical story-line. Vincent Cassel, as ever so rebarbative in beastly aggro, gets an about-face display of bravura in the blistering altercation consummated near the finish-line, don't judge the book by its cover, never, his Antoine is another victim in the aftermath. LÃ©a Seydoux and Nathalie Baye, both send up impressive theatrics of trivial verbosity and rapier-like acrimony to an exuberant extent. Which leaves Marion Cotillard's Catherine, being the only outsider in their bloodline, engages with a more discombobulated outlook in her timorous muttering and courteous self-consciousness, which is not a big stretch for the Oscar-winner, maybe that's why Dolan compensates with overlong glamour gaze into Catherine's dew-eyed comeliness (why will she marry a brute like Antoine, one cannot help wondering?), playing out tacitly with Louis' soulful kindness. We have only been granted sporadic glances into Louis' past in between (in the form of Dolan's emblematic slo-motion, moist and smoky grandeur), there is no buried secrets to be disinterred, no irreconcilable feud running in consanguinity, we have no idea neither what pushed Louis away from home years ago nor what has been keeping him from divulging his tidings now, yes, human emotions are sophisticated, but they are inherently follows certain logical pattern no matter who flimsy it could be, if it is Dolan's intention to obfuscate and equivocate and leave us to pattern the jigsaw, he has done a splendid job. Opening with Camille's poignant HOME IS WHERE IT HURTS and rounding off with Moby's nostalgia-infused NATURAL BLUES, Dolan's latest offering is a tad shambolic in bootstrapping its central drama and overindulges in its artistic license which is dwarfed in front of TOM AT THE FARM or MOMMY (2014), but on the other hand, it doesn't veers into narcissism and smugness as unbearable as in HEARTBEATS (2010), a middle-road residing might not be a bad thing to cool down Dolan's hyped auteur-status, so we might be more poised for another incandescence along the line, inevitably."
" Yet Another Dolan Classic
",0.0,0.8044,2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"I didn't believe Dolan would make a movie that would be more sensitive & touching than 'Mommy'. While I cannot compare these two movies, or any other movies of Dolan, it is undeniably clear that his talent is going to explore much more expanded horizons in the future. Film takes the person to a journey that at the end you're left with heightened emotions and just cannot get the characters out of your mind. The only thing I always criticized in Xavier Dolan is that, he always centers around LGBT issues necessarily. But with this movie, I didn't feel like it was forced, rather it was more of a natural part of the story. To sump up, He did it once again! Of course this is not for everyone, and this is not 10/10 for anyone's taste, but those who enjoys Dolan's work should definitely see it."
" Performance-driven salvation
",0.0,0.9425,2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"I think it's beautiful when creators explain more in shadows and silences than in dialogue and obvious visual cues. There is true brilliance to be found in the hidden and the unsaid; oftentimes, the truth comes in subtle ripples than in galvanized waves, and it's exceptional to come across true masters of the craft who are willing to respectfully handle such an intricate technique without becoming dull and overbearing.Regrettably, such is not the case here.Dolan tries to sweep us off our feet with anthropocentric framing and a flowing stream of ethereal brushings of color and emotion, something he does well, I can't deny him that. In the meanwhile though, he seems to be neglecting the actual plot which is painfully lacking on so many points, this movie is rendered into nothing more than a neophyte's attempt at a college- level, arthousy project.Fortunate that the entirety of the cast is strong enough to redeem this effort by generously depositing spiritful performances, thankfully seeming to overcome the dire facts that the writing is listless, the plot is dormant, and the whole movie seems painfully mannered and conditional. So much so, that the viewer is bound to be left confused and, at times, attacked by the drip-fed, self-folding, monotonous interactions that ultimately serve to dress the movie with no pragmatic value at all.In aiming for elegance and allure, Dolan fails to dish out a well-founded, coherent film, leaving us with nothing more than an unprogressive fable that tiptoes along the verge of deforming from 'suspended' to 'backwards'. And all very chaotically wrapped in out-of-place musical choices, not enhancing but rather debasing the scenes, pulling the viewer out of the experience in flabbergasted eye-rolls.My point of view: Overlooking the feeble dialogue, overall repetitiveness, plot stagnancy and forced emotive filming techniques, I rather enjoyed the performances -- and here is where I rate this. It's Only The End of the World is a lifeless attempt, devoid of any true passion and it could have very easily broken down into oblivion the moment the end titles started rolling - if it weren't for Vincent Cassel's very last scene which, yet again, validates him as one of the Greats.Lucky for me I will always have that to remember."
" I do not agree with...
",-0.2755,-0.5098,2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Most of the critics did not like this movie. Their argument was that it had a great and promising cast, but that the combination didn't add up to much..a disappointment they said. Well, I do not agree at all. And after having seen ""Mommy"" I was convinced that the director couldn't have spoiled things going forward..if anything, he was even getting better. This is one of those movies that whispers something to you without you even knowing. A whisper about a dysfunctional family, wrong timing, memories trapped halfway between your throat and your mouth..Words left unsaid, and meanwhile, everyone eats, everyone smokes, lunch and dessert..white wine Not red. Old Home and the new.. An airport, a cup of coffee and a magazine. A song, a dance while the protagonist is standing outside looking inside himself while everyone is looking at him and staring, wondering why is he here and trying to read what he hasn't even written yet..They are all wondering whether he has the right to show up just like that after 12 years away from them. But isn't he the writer after all, the one with the burden..and the one with the choice? Should he or should he not? say something.. and why can't he leave just like he entered ...without disturbing the order of things. If only there was someone in the crowd who is able to understand his whisper, his slow gestures and his silent scream that keeps reverberating inside..and time strikes again and again. someone lifts him up under a gigantic blue sky. ""Let's go for a drive"". A drive down memory lane, a drive inside a family's heart, mind and soul. A highly emotional and daring movie, tensed, real, so real that it will take your breath away more than once. Highly recommended for its authenticity, great cast, pace, music, cinematography and the well deserved Jury Prize in Cannes 2016."
" Extremely Intriguing, Very Well Crafted & Sad
",-0.1796,0.9163,2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"I found this film intriguing, well crafted, and sad. The subject matter is difficult, and the film's narrative structure was purposefully vague and obscure. To me, it was less of a person's (Louis's) journey, which one often associates with a voice-over first-person narrated film. The film was more family dynamics and the dysfunction between each member of a family. Given that, the way the film was shot with such tight close-ups, and in that autumnal pallet, was very effective. And the repeated shots of the cuckoo clock against that papered wall, with the trapped bird at the end, WOW! A fragile bird, entrapment and loss of freedom, and the passage of time. What an incredible concept so beautifully conveyed cinematically!Score Grid (out of 4):Script/Story: 3Cinematography/Visual Effect: 3.5Editing: 3.5Sound/Musical Score: 3Production Design: 3.5Acting/Performance: 4Recommend the film? Yes, but only for film lovers. This is not entertainment per se. If you want to be challenged, this is a film for you. If you want to be entertained, skip."
" An outstanding piece of work
",0.6124,0.9371,2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"Dolan has accomplished to bring freshness to cinema. Some have described this film as being completely hysterical and noisy, however I feel like everything related to the characters and the plot was completely justified and invited the audience to speculate about the past of the family as there are some blank spaces left unanswered. Obviously, Dolan's visual technique has left no one indifferent, with a brilliant color palette and very strong montages. It really felt a well rounded and overwhelming film, that differs to the previous films in Dolan's work which seemed to be rather disperse and loose as opposed to this one. Although I've also liked some of his other films, I think this one is the benchmark in his filmography along with Mommy. Highly recommended."
" What happened to Dolan?
",0.0,0.7717,2017-01-11 00:00:00,2,"having been immensely impressed with Xavier Dolans's previous works, I took it for granted that I would like this movie. Never would have expected such an immense disappointment. At some point I was even wondering if someone had got it wrong and this wasn't his movie. Essentially: if you read the one-sentence sum up, you know the movie and there is nothing else to be learned or explored. In fact, without knowing the sum-up, I wouldn't even have known what's going on in this movie. The movie switches between random explosions of aggressiveness that don't make a lot of sense and endless ""feels like 2 minutes"" close-ups where the only movement is the blink of the actor's eye, all that accompanies by music that seems completely out of context. I hope Mr Dolan gets back on track to his previous brilliance with future works."
" An uninteresting family with an uninteresting problem
",-0.4019,-0.8152,2017-01-05 00:00:00,3,"This movie is a misstep in the young director's career. It might be worth seeing just to see Dolan fall flat on his face with this pretentious, boring, meandering, nearly unwatchable ""drama"". I say it in quotes because every single moment of intensity is fabricated, there is no true drama in the movie, it's all just excuses so the characters can yell. Feels like Dolan sometimes asked his actors to improvise and forgot to cut out all the bad parts of their improv. All these close-ups are nauseating and completely useless. I don't feel close to these characters and filming them an inch away from their faces won't help it. It's a disappointing mess, and I can't believe Dolan considers it to be his best film. I'm truly afraid for The Death and Life of John F. Donovan, which I was looking forward to. Hope he will straighten his path, because this is a truly bad movie and I don't understand how this got to a 7.2 (fake votes maybe?)"
