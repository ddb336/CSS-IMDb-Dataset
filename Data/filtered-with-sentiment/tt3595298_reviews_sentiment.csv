" Same old storyline but a fairly good family entertainer
",0.8047,0.9042,2021-04-09 00:00:00,4,"Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, which is directed by Sooraj Barjatya. What all can you accept from such movie. Same family based emotional storyline which is not at all appealing.The songs and cinematography are a good pull of the movie with some over the top melodramatic scenes which thus make it an average holiday family entertainer."
" I wasn't even expecting anything and yet I'm disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.9492,2021-04-06 00:00:00,3,"Let's make this absolutely clear. I hate Sooraj Barjatya. He's the reason why family gatherings look so campy. And just when we were relieved we shall never have to see his atrocious movies again, he struck back with this. THIS! And no, he didn't even maintain that level. He stooped it even lower.Everything about this movie is bad. Just straight up bad. Salman Khan looks ugly, the dialogues are atrocious, the story is poor, the acting is terrible, the music brings tears to my eyes (because I can't stand the torture), the visuals are unoriginal. I have no idea how on earth does this movie have a higher budget than Baahubali.And of course there are the fillers. Because it's a Sooraj Barjatya movie. How can we not have Salman Khan playing football with all the guests who are divided in the teams of men and women? And there's literally a song in which Salman Khan is singing whether he should take spinach for the princess or carrots. I literally rolled my eyes when that song played.The only good thing about this movie is Neil Nitin Mukesh. And you know how bad your film has to be when he's the best thing about it. If this film wasn't free on Hotstar I'd have never watched it. After Bajrangi Bhaijaan this was a huge letdown. I'd say skip it."

" Worst Acting
",-0.6249,-0.765,2020-09-09 00:00:00,2,This is one of the worst actings of Salman Khan and Sonam. For that matter I think Sonam cannot act at all and no expressions.I am a fan of Bharjatiya films but was disappointed with this one.

",-0.7088,-0.024,2020-06-27 00:00:00,2,Bollywood mediocrity is alive and well ... acting (lack of it) of Sonam Kapoor is very disappointing to say the least.

",-0.2755,-0.5267,2020-06-20 00:00:00,1,Sonam Kapoor don't know acting it makes me to puke.
" Its imperfect, but a necessity of current time
",-0.1655,0.9581,2020-06-15 00:00:00,5,"This movie consisted several things that I hated, and hence it took me 5 years to give it a shot. I typically don't see a movie with Salman or Sonam in it, after previous experiences and the complete lack of effort and logic that tags along these stars.And this movie for a lot many parts, just more of the same. Be it the brutal melodrama, or the senselessness at several pivotal points where a Sheeshmahal made for kids breaks down repeatedly and proves to be the most dangerous place you can be at, when it falls apart from one guy standing on the top of it. And similar events happen throughout the movie, which leaves you wondering whether this movie is even made for a sane person, but this is expected with the starcast.What made me watch this movie was Sooraj Barjatya, and I have rated this movie majorly as a Sooraj Barjatya movie. The movie fails here as well, but not as magnanimously. Still, the emotional family elements are mostly illogical, in your face, melodramatic and still not exactly groundbreaking as we've seen in previous Barjatya movies like Vivah and Hum Aapke Hai kaun.So, what exactly put me through the 3 hours? I mostly stop movies in between if I struggle much, but the innocence, the music, the setting and at some points, the reflection of older Barjatya movies saves it for me. And above all the rarity of such movies in the past decade helps as well. PRDP is at some point unique enough to be seen in this day and age, and is definitely the best attempt at recreating the older charm of Salman and Barjatya right now. We can see the efforts been put in, and that's respectable."
" TERRIBLE
",-0.4767,-0.802,2020-05-08 00:00:00,1,One of the worst movies of 2015. Just disappointed.
" This film is very good!!!
",0.6211,0.9464,2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,"Having watched this film I found it full of emotion, funny, witty, colourful and a good story line to match.
What were the people who gave it negative reviews watching? Were they asleep from over working? Were the critics so full of themselves that they cant see past there noses anymore?
It was a lighthearted story, not overly complicated, simple to follow with good songs with catchy lyrics and music.
The story is about princely step brothers and sisters, two boys, two girls but one father the King.
Their is a love interest through Sonam Kapoor.
The story revolves around an attempted assassination on Salman Khan the oldest. The princess who is due in the palace a few days later cannot be told the truth.
A double role of Salman Khan steps in and takes over the story from there.
I do not wish to give to much away.
For those who have not watched it please do. You will enjoy it. Just loosen up a little and dont be too serious, enjoy."

" A Salman film all the way !!
",0.0,0.9963,2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"Salman Khan and Sooraj Barjatya coming together after over two decades should have definitely been a momentous occasion for all fans but unfortunately it is not. The film is not bad but there is something missing as compared to the earlier Barjatya movies like Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aapke Hain Kaun.Story: Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (PRDP) has a simple plot and tells the story of a royal family, family feuds, power struggle among siblings, illegitimate children fathered by kings etc.The film has Salman Khan in a double role, which should certainly enhance its box office collections since you get 2 Salman's for the price of one (we could have done with a third one too if the plot had permitted !!!! )In one of his two roles, Salman is a Ramleela actor who, along with a friend (Deepak Dobriyal), finds himself in the middle of a plot to eliminate a righteous prince (also played by Salman) who is days away from his coronation. The would-be king has enemies in the palace. So a trusted minister (Anupam Kher) hatches a plot to save him by installing a lookalike in his place. The efforts put in by the lookalike in order to bring together the real prince's estranged family comprising of brother Neil Nitin Mukesh, 2 step sisters and his beautiful fiancée , Sonam Kapoor forms the crux of the plot.Cast: Salman plays both the roles earnestly namely: 1)Ramleela actor, Prem Dilwale who provides the much required comic relief in the film with his witty one-liners. 2)The righteous Prince Vijay who suffers a vicious attack on his life just days before his coronation.Sonam Kapoor: Looks great as she always does. Decent job done.Neil Nitin Mukesh: Looks great as the prince's estranged brother, but there are very few scenes where he can actually show his acting prowess. His role has either suffered at the editing table or it hasn't been properly etched out.Arman Kohli: Looks great for a change as the antagonist, but again like Neil Nitin Mukesh, does not have a role which can create an impact.Rest of the cast namely Anupam Kher, Swara Bhaskar, Deepak Dobriyal and others do a decent job. Sanskari Babuji (Alok Nath is sorely missed in the film!!)Songs: Too many of them in the film, apart from the lead number, all others are passable.Direction: Barjatya does a good job but has to remain in tune with the times as plot is stale and seems dated especially with scenes like the Price traveling on a horse carriage and the princess traveling in an ordinary train. VFX is used to create a magnificent Sheesh-Mahal at the edge of a menacing waterfall.You have to give him credit though for the tasteful recreation of Rajasthan's royalty which is enhanced by the great locales. See this movie if :1) you are a die hard Salman Khan fan 2) a true Sooraj Barjatya fan 3) Dimaag baju main rakhkar picture dekhne ki aadat hai. A normal trait seen among Salman fans .My Verdict :3 Stars ( 2 and a half for the movie and an additional half star for Prem Dilwale's earnestness)"
" One of the worst movie in Salman Khan's career
",-0.6249,0.9986,2017-04-23 00:00:00,4,"I just watch PRDP, The movie was good to an extent but if you watch the movie as an overall, it was kind of disappointing and it was a terrible movie. It was Bakwaas (nonsense) and illogical movie. The direction wasn't so great. Especially the story, I was expecting something else, I wasn't expected a full at drama movie. Normally when you watch the movie, you get more appealing and more attractive and interested to watch the rest of the movie. You know like you get attracted, OK we get excited to watch the movie. But I wasn't feeling that at all in this one. The plus point and the good parts of the film is the cinematography, I was very well shot and they spend a lot of time for the money and the locations. Another good part is Salman Khan, so Salman Khan did a great job. As you could see that he's playing a dual role, one is a prince and the other is an lover and romantic person. He was excellent in this film. And the Sonam Kapoor is good, she was superb, her acting was good, she playing almost like a princess and lover in this film. The character was well design, There are some portions, they was showing her side that it was not believable which means like you felt like OK she is not actually a princess. She's like a shy and innocent person. So they could have done a bit better characterization for Sonam Kapoor. The negative parts and the mindless point is the story, the story is a big big letdown, it spoiled with too much drama, there is too much drama in this movie. Especially the first half was boring, towards the second half could have been better, again there is too much emotional in this film. It makes you boring and sleep all the time. You don't get captivating to watch this movie. The emotional sequence doesn't work at all, it was not well made and it did not fulfilled in this film. Towards the climax, where they was an action sequence, that's totally unnecessary, they need to cut that scene, its just dragging the movie even more. The only thing which I like is the football sequence and the music. The football scene where they was an song was funny and hilarious. It was very well done. And the music by Himesh Reshammiya was also good, there are some songs was very good and some songs was OK. With the family audiences, i think they felt like boring and tired to watch this movie. For me, when I watch the movie, I was so bored at theaters, I was like let's finished the movie very quick. Because it was just draggy. So the story could have been a lot better to get interesting to watch the movie. I heard that it has a big budget movie as well because of the VFX was terrible and so poor. It has a poor execution. I don't know there is something wrong or it's because of the post production and we don't able to see the vision of Sooraj Barjatya. This is turned out to be the mistake of Sooraj Barjatya did. He hasn't recreate the magic of classic films like Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Hum Saath Saath Hain. Even i was expecting a much more fascinating and much more captivating story line. But it was not there in this film, it was missing. the film could have been the biggest romantic film ever but overall, PRDP is basic movie. There is nothing special in this movie. You guys can watch this film with your family without expectations. But in my opinion, its one time watch movie that's gonna come out probably 1 or 2 or 3 years. Its very hard to writing the story and executed the film. We should appreciated their effort at least this movie but even through the story was not appealing to me and the family audiences. We should encourage them to make such a movie with different story. Even through Sooraj Barjatya spend a lot of time to write the story and post production, just trying your best to make a big movie and better story line."
" Action, Romance and Family
",0.5574,0.9721,2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"This retelling of the Prisoner of Zenda is a thoroughly enjoyable Diwali film full of action, romance, and family. Salman Kahn did an admirable job of playing the dual roles, but Sonam Kapoor was a bit stilted. The supporting cast was good, the music fun, and the classic plot a pleasure."
" not entertaining and funny like I expected
",-0.3208,0.7522,2017-02-20 00:00:00,3,"I've been a fan of Salman and Sonam a long time, and hoped for some funny and entertaining movie. The result is far from that, I guess some moments work, like when Sonam convinces the sisters to give Vijay a chance, but already the characters don't catch your interest, it's Salman and Sonam so you don't stop the movie right now, but they don't develop as they should as characters that hold your breath until the end of the movie. The story (once the swap with the prince is done) gets boring fast, and the action scenes are not remarkable. Potential spoiled as I'm sure Salman/Sonam can bring good moments together."
