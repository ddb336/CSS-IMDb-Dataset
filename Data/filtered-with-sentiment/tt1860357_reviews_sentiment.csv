" Deepwater Horizon
",0.0,0.5748,2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,Deepwater horizon was a really good movie that told a real story About an Oil Rig When I first bought this movie I did not even watch it for a while it was not so interested into it I watched it today I really like Mark Wahlberg performance in this movie I liked all the characters in this movie the only character they want u really to care about is the wife in this movie which to me trying to be in the movie The Oil stuff what happens is insane It was cool visually and it was insane crazy I give Deepwater Horizon An B+
" Informative
",0.0,0.3597,2021-04-04 00:00:00,4,"As a historical film, this was very informative. The story was very realistic and the way this was filmed was also so realistic I wondered how it was filmed. It was a very heroic movie the latter half of the movie was just filled with fire scenes and explosions, and as accurate was it was, there was so much of it that I was skipping parts of it."
" Realistic acting and effects when Deepwater Horizon exploded, set on fire and collapsed. Very realistic film of that real accident.
",-0.765,-0.2144,2021-02-28 00:00:00,7,"Drama/history/accident film based on a true story. This is the biggest accident in the history of the oil industry in the US, which occurred in 2010. The first half of the film is something meaningless and perhaps boring, the film tries to show us some deepwater horizon crew members, but it should be shorter. The second half is the accident itself, where the pressure of the underwater pipe is high and defuses initially but then follows an explosion and the Deepwater Horizon is engulfed in flames and gradually collapses. Crew members try to survive and fight against time, explosions and flames. In the end it shows the real characters as well as some of the victims of the accident. An overall pretty good effort, although it could have been better, filling more in the second half of the film and reducing the first half that was pretty meaningless. As a whole it is recommended, and both Wahlberg and Kurt Russell are very good at their role."
" A Real Monster Story!
",0.0,0.99,2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,I didn't really know what to expect when first going into this film. For the most part it was shot great. Being base on a true story. I believe they captured some great moments. There's several scenes in this movie the I love to re-watch. There's a part where Mark Wahlberg's character is telling his daughter about his job and its just awesome to watch. My favorite character in the film is the Oil Drill. Its a true beast. Some shots reminded me of Steven Spielberg's movie Jaws. Acting in this film was good from all the actors and the special effects are good. There's just a few events/hero moments that where just a little over the top to me. But... This is a survival story and its a great watch.
" Not For The Faint-Hearted . . . or Epilectically inclined
",0.0,0.9934,2021-01-11 00:00:00,2,"This is not a review or comment on the story (why bother re-telling stories and plots in reviews anyway?) but on the film and its technique.
And right from the beginning I would say I am only partly qualified to review it. This is because I could not watch it.
This is my statement on (and my plea against) the whole hand-held camera culture and what it does to otherwise (possibly) perfectly good movies. It is an abomination.
Perhaps the creatives thought it would give teh story the realism it deserves. Think again! The story carries the thrill, not the guy/gal carrying the camera in a sweaty hand.
Now quite possibly those with brains that are not prone to seizures brought on by external neural influences (like strobe lighting eg) may find this movie exciting and half their luck. But for us folk who actually like to see a story told in a manner that, to say the least, does not actually distract us from the story, it is unwatchable . . .. very much like most other movies made with the infamous hand-held.
Now there is a place for it, to be sure. But it needs to be used with great discretion. Or left to the undergraduates at film school as they find their footing for the reel world.
Hell, it's not as if they needed to cut corners and save a few dollars on proper cameras surely! But that is how it comes across.
So, sorry, had to give this one a miss, but I read the reviews and the synopsis and have a pretty good idea of it all. Just a pity I couldn't watch it as a movie."
" A sad story wrapped in a great movie
",0.25,0.9938,2020-12-10 00:00:00,8,"Wow, what a movie this is. It's sad, ofcourse, that it's based on true events. But it's a great movie. I love Wahlberg and he plays this role perfectly. A strong leading character in a setting ruled by male group energy. Gina Rodriguez is perfect for the role as the only female on the rig. The movie has it all: a great cast with Russell and Malkovich, a good script, a convincing work atmosphere that you would expect on a rig, spectaculair CGI and the story of greed with all of it's consequences. Overall a must watch if you're interested in the synopsis"
" So sad!

" Too bad
",-0.5423,-0.977,2020-11-09 00:00:00,4,"It's an interesting story, but it's a shame it wasn't made by a director able to tell a coherent story and an actor with more range than a baseball pitcher with late stage Lou Gehrig's disease. I still have no idea why this happened the way it did, and when all hell finally breaks loose it's all a jumbled mess. Painfully mediocre. It would also have been good taste to at least mention the massive environmental damage caused by the events portrayed in this film."
" Intense
",0.0772,0.5994,2020-11-09 00:00:00,8,"An intense and dramatic movie that recounts a huge event in American history.Marky Mark is always stellar in all his movies. His acting adds an intensity unlike any other.I watched this movie all the way to the end. I found it both educational, informing, and mind-blowing.Thank you to the heros on that day of April 20th."
" I wish they spoke understandable english
",0.4019,0.7868,2020-10-28 00:00:00,6,"Show was ok and entertaining but as someone who only speaks English i had trouble understanding them for 90% of the movie. I understand they wanted to make it authentic and the actors spoke with the same Southern USA accents as the characters they portrayed but most English speaking people can't understand that.
These actors normally speak perfect English so I know its not their fault and must have been the choice of the director. If you are not from Southern USA then turn the subtitles on."
" Well made movie, good acting and a tribute.
",0.6124,-0.7096,2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,"First of all a technically well made disaster movie. It also highlights the fate of the men and women directly affected by the event (which was at the time somewhat overshadowed by the public focus on the environmental damage). It is also a tribute to the American working class portrayed by Mark Wahlberg and specially by Kurt Russell as Mr. Jimmy. Small drawback: John Malkovich's acting as the "" typical incompetent management guy"" is a bit over the top."
" Perrrrrrfect work üëçüèΩ
",0.0,0.987,2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,"Peter Berg that's mean incredible thing unbelievable thing, (wow wow wow wow) how can I describe him?!!
It's impossible on any director to do what he did in this movie, all this success for a movie was depend on director.. Last thing, Mark Wahlberg this human creats the characters, he is the best choice, he is another wow wow wow. Lol"
" What happened needs better explanation
",0.4404,-0.88,2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,"An impressive recreation of the Deepwater Horizon offshore floating rig, the key individuals working on it, and the disastrous explosion and spill that occurred. The story ends with the rescue of all but the dozen or so who perished in the catastrophe, and doesn't deal with the efforts to tap the leak and the damaged caused by the resulting pollution, and BP's less-than exemplary efforts to set things right. Despite the film's attempt to explain in laymen's terms what happened (even using the main character's daughter's science project to demonstrate the concept involved), it's never clear exactly what happened or why, other than the fact that shortcuts were taken and safeguards overlooked, all apparently in an effort to get the rig back on schedule (it was more than 40 days behind). A good lesson in why we need regulations and government agencies to enforce them."
" Watchable but unexceptional disaster movie
",-0.7684,-0.3182,2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"A paint by numbers disaster film, saved by an A list cast and captivating effects. Berg does manage to inject a fair amount of pace and tension into a very light weight script to make a watchable, undemanding popcorn flick."
" Good job
",0.4404,0.7425,2020-07-23 00:00:00,7,"At first, the kissing scene seemed like a movie. Then everything seemed to be where I came from. The accident happened in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. The acting of the actors is very good and really feels."
" Genuine Tension
",-0.3182,0.1779,2020-06-09 00:00:00,7,Wonderful cast that brought a palpable tension and edge. Slow start but edge if ur seat drama mostly
" Gripping and emotional.
",0.1531,0.8436,2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,Gripping and emotional true story. Mark wahlberg never disappoints and this one shows true spirit.
" The second half makes it all worth it
",0.2263,0.3615,2020-05-15 00:00:00,7,"The first half is alright. There's some fine moments of levity and some unintentuonally funny moments, like John Malkovich's wonderfully malkovich performance and Kurt Russel's pronunciation of the word ""cement"", but it was nothing special.The second half, on the other hand, is absolutely terrifying.
It doesn't depict the disaster as an exciting action set piece, but as a harrowing living nightmare from hell.
It's incredible, immensely disturbing and hard to watch.
It made it all worth it."
" Horrible booring
",-0.5423,-0.8172,2020-05-13 00:00:00,3,"Horrible booring I'm so disappointed üò•

" A classic 'disaster' blockbuster
",0.5994,0.9785,2020-05-13 00:00:00,7,"Deepwater Horizon is very much like lots of other blockbusters, but it is enjoyable and worth a watch if you're not up for something too taxing. It helps that I really like Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell is great value.We all know the script, something bad is going to happen, but the film is well executed and the fact that is is based on a true story (that I didn't know the outcome of) adds to the tension. All the characters fill the necessary gaps; a few 'good' guys, a few 'bad' guys, lots of brave guys and a worrying partner at home for good measure. They are all done well though and you soon find yourself invested in the outcome.6.9/10 - Expect some witty dialogue, a few tense moments and lots of big action sequences. Oh and don't forget the popcorn."
" Well done recreation of the BP oil rig that blew up in 2010...
",0.1531,-0.8804,2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"1st watched 10/15/2016 :
Well done recreation of the BP oil rig that blew up in 2010 and started a major investigation. The movie is ""not"" about the investigation, but about the oil rig(called ""Deepwater Horizon""), and the people who worked on it and were a part of the disaster. This movie shines because it focuses on this aspect of the incident(the disaster itself). It stars a bunch of capable actors including Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Kate Hudson - who encompass a story, I believe, that people want to hear. The workers knew they weren't in for a cakewalk when they boarded the hovering ship. Right away - the 2 big dogs(Russell & Wahlberg) question the lack of a concrete stress test. The bigwigs are interested in getting the drilling done as quickly as possible, but the ones that know what they are doing won't easily falter. Eventually - after a few stress tests - they allow the drilling to happen, but things soon fall apart. The rest of the movie is the action of the disaster - unknown by most folks, without seeing this movie. This is why the movie is so interesting and effective. Not to be missed."
" Focuses mainly on the explosion & immediate aftermath, and little on the finer details
",0.0,-0.8862,2020-05-08 00:00:00,7,"It's sad to think that Transocean/BP lost nothing, and 11 people lost their lives (and who knows how many millions of animals died from the 210million gallons of oil that was spilled).Transocean/BP got at least a $500million insurance payout, and who knows how many billions of dollars they made from the Deepwater Horizon rig in the 10years that they operated it. And NOBODY went to prison. 11 people dead and no repercussions.Anyway, the film is pretty good... I would have liked it if they went into a bit of detail on what all the various terms is that they used like marine riser, annular, EDS, kick, and so on. They used to many terms and jargon that the average viewer is left in the dark. They could maybe even have shown what the capping process looks like in the aftermath of the whole event, as I think the capping process would have been very interesting and would have placed a capper (excuse the pun) on the whole movie.But it's a good movie to watch if you're interested in the whole event, even-though it does offer only a cursory glance at the causes of the disaster, and spends the majority of the time focusing on the panic & mayhem that happened during the actual explosion."
" Not a word about the ecological consequences
",0.0,-0.9614,2020-04-20 00:00:00,4,"I can't believe thid movie is 100% focused on the people working on the oil rig. To be crass: What's worse, 11 dead humans or the enormeous damage to nature and wildlife?Even in a situation like this, the station including staff and their responsibilities must be much better equipped to prevent or minimize the disaster on the surroundings. If not, such platforms should not be allowed.Obama said, ""This oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced"".At least the last 1/3 of the movie should be about the aftermath. This is so irresponsible. It is just like another ""Towering Inferno"" movie."
" Oil
",0.0,0.25,2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,Quaint rom com. I like the bit where the oil rig blows up
" Excellent action/suspense movie but....
",0.5719,-0.9354,2020-03-12 00:00:00,7,"I can't speak to how realistic this movie is I don't know the details. This was a real event and people lost their lives. But for the conversations and details within the movie I am not sure how accurate it is but it doesn't matter if you want a good fast paced tense movie this is a good one. I have mixed feelings about it, the movie focuses on the oil rig workers and really focuses on putting the blame on the BP execs and basically saying they forced us into this situation. Which might be how it happened.They show the real folks at the end of the movie so I am sure you can dig into the actual facts and I know BP was sued or fined billions of dollars over this. It was interesting to see the life on an oil rig and show just how scary things can get if things go wrong.There are lots of scenes of people getting hurt or killed so if you are sensitive to that don't watch. Otherwise its a solid movie and great acting from Mark and Kurt."
" An impressively done film...both heart-breaking and infuriating...it's story will leave a deep impact.( Hong Kong B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",0.4215,-0.4939,2020-03-07 00:00:00,9,"The range of well-developed characters, detailed analysis of the pre and post crisi, and the score all worked perfectly together to turn a real life horror story, into a real life horror story you can see in theatres."
" Expressing a real tragedy
",-0.6597,-0.9845,2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie was great in showing the disaster happened in April 20,2010 intially and was followed by oil spill in Gulf of Mexico for a few months! the movie clearly shows what happened and why this happened. I just saw this movie and I enjoyed it. during the movie the crew on oil rig ran a negative test( a test which basically is done before the mission starts to see if the pipes can handle the pressure and if there is any pressure on the main pipe). They say that there is a huge pressure on the main pipe but the coordinators on this event asked them to run this mission anyways without really think of how dangerous the situation is. What worst is the manager of the crew team (the one who has to give the crew permission to start the mission) thought that pressure would be okay. He was under the pressure of supervisors because the project was behind about 51 days. So they started pumping up the oil and eventually the pressure built up and pipes broke down. massive amount of pressure was on pipes and oil started flowing out. following this the generators started to work faster than normal and the heat they produced made a massive fire and then a explosion and one second later the whole rig was on fire. the movie pictured all these events just fine and what is sad is that 11 crew members lost their lives and about 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled out in the ocean. It was the greatest tragedy in oil industry for the U.S. I personally recommend to definitely watch this movie."
" Great Movie for Climate Change Deniers
",0.4588,-0.0176,2020-01-11 00:00:00,2,"If you're worried about being lectured about the environmental impact of mining for fossil fuels, don't, because this movie doesn't mention it once. We don't even learn anything about any the damage this disaster caused. Everyone is an all American hero and you can continue your day feeling completely guilt free.If you can accept the movie is complete fantasy, you might enjoy the special effects.Absolute trash."

Ouch.Exactly the cause behind the tragic incident and the shortsighted people responsible for the stupid mistakes which got them this far makes the film worth watching by itself.The highlight though, is definitely the blowing up of the station and the dreadful aftermath. Fire everywhere, collapsing structures aplenty and people scrambling for lifeboats... total chaos. I love it.Give it a whirl. 7/10"

This movie did take its time to get going but that's fine. When it finally gets to the meat and potatoes, wow, hold on to your hats. Once the accident happens, ""Deepwater Horizon"" becomes quite terrifying. This movie is a powerful and moving tribute to the victims and their families.

From the sarcastic banter to the realistic sets, it was great. Russell, Wahlberg, and Malkovitch are terrific. The only thing I thought was missing was a bit more explanation of what a cement bond log is and why it was so important, and same thing for the negative pressure test. Glad they made this movie and glad they went to such lengths to make it as real as possible."
" Rewriting history using movies

No partiers, no drunks, no one greedy for money any way they can get it. I think British Petroleum paid good money so this movie could influence the public and worked hard to put oil rig workers in a good light. I would never work for any oil company ever. I despise the whole oil industry for dominating the transportation industry for 100 years and counting. Damn the oil."

",0.0258,0.9837,2019-08-06 00:00:00,7,"Deepwater horizon (2016)
Probably one of the best disaster drama in last 10 year which itself based on true event n please refer Google once before u watch this movie..mike Williams ( mark wahlberg) is just a normal family guy works in huge oil rig site (based on real life character)
Most of the film take place offshore gaint drilling rig,First half is bit slow even opening scenes are not much to do with a actual movie they just shown for character introduction...Actual movie starts after 45mins most of first half scenes are about technical side stuffs of how oil rig process works n its something like documentary but worth watching...second half almost racy n edge of the seat experience till the climax scene,fire explosion scenes are really a visual treat
CGI is one of the most perfect part of this movie n also amazing Background score too...A good entertaining movie with the message..."

The performances are on point, completely great and fervent, Mark and Kurt do an incredible job as the tough guys but genuinely worried about the lives of their co-workers. The cinematography of the film is something special, the scenes are incredible to admire with fantastic special effects, the fire is extremely realistic and gives an excellent sensation of panic and heat, that plus the incredible sound design make Deepwater Horizon a movie very intense and provocative.I am surprised by the fact not only that the film itself is a great achievement for effects, but also how the performances and the script manage to create a quite realistic and palpable scenario in which we can feel the terror of seeing the fire engulf the entire platform. Highly recommended."

But I didn't learn anything new except for one single thing. The people. This is for all intents and purposes a tear jerker wrapped in an action film. The Foley's, well that bird did come on in.

Many peoples lives were affected, especially those whose jobs had to go with fishing or boating. Several months with any gulf shrimp or oysters, hurt a lot of companies. But enough about that. This was a great film based on true events. I enjoyed this movie and thought they did a great job explaining what exactly happened. There are several of these types of oil rigs in the Gulf, and each one can have a tragic event like Deep Water Horizon. Great action and suspense. Overall a great flick."

",-0.9001,-0.8864,2019-01-25 00:00:00,5,"Just looked upon as an action/drama movie it is reasonably good, because the stunts and special effects are pretty impressive and the sentiments (violins, crying houswives and children) about the loss of 11 people is done with much effective melodrama towards the end. Great photography and editing and quite good acting performances by Kurt Russel and John Malkovich. Mark Wahlberg, as ever, just looks plain dumb, but for his standards he acts good as well. So just judging it as an action/drama it will make pass the time enjoyably, without ever getting really bored.The biggest criticism I have is what this movie does NOT show. What is not being shown? What is not even mentioned one single time? The devastating permanent impact on the environment. None of that is ever mentioned. That is ridiculous and whitewashing the actual events as they have happened. As if this was only a human drama and not also the worst environmental oil disaster in recorded history. I have got a bitter after taste because of that whitewashing of this historical environmental disaster."

" A True Story About True Heroes...
",0.6808,0.988,2019-01-10 00:00:00,8,"This film is based on a true story from April 2010 when in a terrible disaster an offshore drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon, explodes. This is a film based on the worst oil spill in U.S history.Mike Williams (played by Wahlberg) is a chief electrical engineer along with the Operational Supervisor above him (played by Kurt Russell). Both crew members begin their day working along the large crew on Deepwater Horizon and begin to raise concern and suspicions on the safety checks and the overall condition of the large oil rig. This leads to them to express their thoughts to an executive committee of BP employees who are located on the same rig. One of the committee member is played with great craft by John Malkovich.Due the BP company's back log, risk of finance and other people's opinions on current safely practice, things slowly and gradually build up to a very suspenseful film.Director Peter Berg is well known for telling true stories through his films as we recently saw again with Mark Wahlberg in ""Lone Survivor"". The director is also known for his work with ""Battleships"" & ""Hancock"". Judging from the director's previous films I was expecting an impacting film with great audio & visuals which I'm happy to announce he did deliver. This film's audio effects, including explosions, oil sprays & the sound of a large oil rig moving etc, is all here thank to a well mixed Dolby Atmos Track.Like most films based on a true story there are a couple of ""Hollywood Moments"" which normally can get in the way of a great movie. Luckily enough, this was minor compared to what could have been.A strong positive comment for this review is the chemistry between actor Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell. It was fantastic to see and they displayed genuine moments throughout the film. Actress Kate Hudson's accent does change throughout the film....Many will find this annoying üò§Overall, Deepwater Horizon is a gripping & suspenseful film and I was grateful to see this in cinemas. Like the recent film ""Sully"", if you're familiar with the tragic events of Deepwater Horizon be sure to check this out.7.8/10

The set up of the good guys and bad guys is plausible (though a little too technical for me to follow) and the actual disaster is suitably adrenalin fuelled, and harrowing. But its unclear how much, if any, of this has been dramatised, so whilst and enjoyable film, the simplistic black and white analysis of what went wrong is unsatisfying."

BP cut corners, did not do proper safety tests that led to death and destruction.Set in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater Horizon is an exploration oil rig hired by BP for deepwater drilling.We get to meet the crew. Grizzled veteran Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) is the supervisor, safety conscious and suspicious of the men in suits who he thinks are bean counters and not concerned about safety.Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) is the electronics technician. The villain of the piece, representing BP management is Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich.)The build up to disaster takes half the movie and frankly the first half is not very gripping. The second part of the movie deals with the disaster. When things go wrong, there is chaos. The oil gushes out, there are explosions, fires are started, water and mud is coming in and people are in jeopardy.Only Malkovich makes an impression with a laconic performance. Wahlberg might well had been invisible. The characters are paper thin and uninteresting.Director Peter Berg comes across as a substandard Michael Bay. This is a technically well made film but it lacks heart. Worse the environmental devastation of the oil spill is glossed over."

It is sad to watch how greed can kill innocent people. This movie executed the story properly.

" Environmental disaster not dealt with.
",-0.6249,-0.9851,2018-08-08 00:00:00,1,"This boring movie only deals with the events happening up untill the explosion.A bunch of rednecks, whose southern accent I could only understand with subtitles on, works on an oilrig. *SPOILERS AHEAD*A boss, played by always slimey John Malkovic,h is responsible for the accident, al though Im not sure how. There is alot of technical mumbo jumbo that only makes sense for people working on oilrigs. Mark Whalberg plays Mark Whalberg and Kate Hudson plays his annoying wife whose only job is to worry if her husband survived. Kurt Russel plays another boss, but he is one of the goodguys for some reason. If you expect an actionmovie you will be dissapointed. Nothing happens for 51 minutes. Youre introduced to alot of rednecks that you wont get to know or care about despite the movie taking its time before the explosion. And when the action does happen, its hard to tell whats going on, because its dark and there is alot of shaky cam. Afterwards there are videoes from a hearing and investigation into the accident. The characters played by Whalberg and Russel looks nothing like the real characters. Which is lazy and dumb. The impact on the environment from the explosion isn only dealt with, showing a pelican covered in oil and dying. And a text saying it was the worst oil disaster in US history. And then we see pictures of the real 11 killed rednecks with some annoying countrysong playing in the background. This movie doesnt know wether it wants to be drama or an actionmovie. And as a result its neither. Not worth watching."
" Berg highlights heroism in 'Horizon'
",0.5859,-0.4111,2018-07-22 00:00:00,7,"We all know the story from the headlines - the April 2010 BP oil rig disaster off the Louisiana coast that left 11 dead and many more injured. In Peter Berg's 'Deepwater Horizon,' we see the circumstances that led up to the moment when the rig malfunctioned, as well as the heroism that took place as the events unfolded in the black of night.The focus of 'Horizon' is not on the politics behind the disaster, nor is it about the technical aspects of working on an oil rig (although there's a little bit of both mixed in here). It's about the people. Chief among them is Mike Williams, portrayed by Mark Wahlberg, who oversees electrical engineering, and operations supervisor Jimmy Harrell (played by a banged up Kurt Russell). The Williams/Harrell duo try to raise awareness of the state of the 'Horizon' to the BP bigwigs, including one middle manager played by John Malkovich. But where the cast really delivers is showing how people acted when everything went to hell.'Horizon' has the signature marks of a Berg film. From shaky-cam effects and aerial shots to Michael Bay-esque sound effects and heart-pounding soundtracks. The action sequences are enough to keep you interested throughout, and visual spectacles cause by a structure in chaos. People's heroic actions are highlighted, like Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) and Caleb Holloway (Dylan O'Brien), and the fact that there are actual real individuals who were able to make a difference as employees escaped the inferno is a positive aspect to focus on.Sure, some could say 'Deepwater Horizon' is over the top and melodramatic, and it languished at the box office. But the fact that it pays homage to those who lost their lives or were forever impacted by this disaster - something that was lost in the aftermath as covered in the media - is a solid reason why this film was made."
" Outstanding

In his film ""Deepwater Horizon"", director Peter Berg adopts a documentary approach and takes his time getting to the big bang and the movie is all the better for it. This is a movie that never exploits either its subject or its characters while still ticking all the necessary boxes and benefits considerably from a first-rate cast, (Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, a terrific John Malkovitch, Kate Hudson etc), all at the top of their game; no mean feat when the real star of the picture is an exploding oil rig, (special effects, cinematography, editing, sound recording are all top notch).

And when the hero, Mike, finally reunited with his family, I felt like crying for joy with them.It is an important story to tell.

" Blowout to tremendous visual effect. A tragic story
",-0.4588,-0.9564,2018-06-30 00:00:00,7,"An American action drama; Deepwater Horizon was the largest oil rig in the world and had been digging the deepest well in history beneath the Gulf of Mexico. The crew had been shutting down the exploratory Macondo Well, which potentially had a high yield of oil, when disaster struck.Patrick Morgan, who was an assistant driller on the Deepwater Horizon rig, said of the movie before it was released: ""I just don't want to see politics and political correctness and all that crap play into it."" The film focused on the tragedy of the explosion and honouring the 11 men who lost their lives.Despite some cumbersome schmaltz early on, the film settles on the story, precisely documenting the stages of the disaster. These scenes are accompanied by a fast dialogue that feels authentic with tossed around shorthand and lingo. Tension rises with clever editing as each step of mechanical failure is shown. The film achieves works very well on a special effects level, but as with many real-life films there are some inconsistencies in the factual telling which are worth noting.
The explosion came about due to years of cutting corners and not one careless mistake. The villain of the piece, BP Executive Donald Vidrine, played by John Malkovich in a gumbo-thick Louisiana drawl, in reality was not to blame. Vidrine spoke by phone to a BP engineer in Houston with regard to the problematic 'negative test' which proved fatal for the oil rig workers. Government investigations concluded that it was his BP superiors in Houston who were largely giving the orders for the crew to get work completed quicker on the well, which was 43 days behind schedule. BP's company man Vidrine certainly didn't expect that his decisions on the fateful day would lead to an inferno. The filmmakers could have found a better explanation for why intelligent people sometimes make such terrible decisions. Alas, this was an action movie with a story than needed someone to blame. In spite of this, several oversights and missteps were made by BP, and Halliburton - the American multinational corporation, and the Swiss company Transocean.
U.S. federal regulators who supervised drilling in the Gulf of Mexico signed off on Transoecean's plans at every stage, but this would not feature in the film's story and neither would the fact that all oil rigs were not fit for purpose.
The blowout preventer, which failed to stem the flow of oil when the wellhead erupted (widely used throughout the industry) was likely to be declared not fit for purpose.
All in all, an engrossing film and an affecting drama on human folly and obsession."

The film is an absolute masterpiece - from the great cast to the mind blowing visual effects. The music was awesome and highly effective. The build up to the disaster was very well done with tension almost from the start. Once the action started, it grabbed hold of you and never let go, as it plunged the viewer deeper into the ""well from hell"" with every frame.

" Well-executed, thrilling, and a true story
",0.7096,-0.7829,2018-06-12 00:00:00,7,"Don't be confused: above all else, Deepwater Horizon is a disaster film. Unsuspecting characters mingle harmlessly and provide exposition about themselves and their surroundings to allow a second-half non-stop action fest. There are movies that follow the formula conventionally and do a good job at it, others do a poor job at it, and even some others try putting a twist on the formula. This film-for the most part-is successful. For a clear disaster film, what works the most is actually the beginning. It takes awhile for the action to start happening, so this means we have to care about the characters so that we're worried about their fates when death closes in in the second half. The writing is solid and engaging, Wahlberg has chemistry with everyone, and Kurt Russell brings the soul and spirit into the film. John Malkovich plays a rather conventional white collar antagonist, but needless to say, the buildup for the inevitable is really well done. If you've been living under a rock for the past decade, I'll quickly explain the point of this film. In 2010 an offshore oil rig exploded and resulted in the worst oil spill in U.S. history. This is the story of the workers on-board when it happened, and how pressure from executives to meet deadlines and cut costs ultimately led to the explosions that tragically killed and injured too many. The set for the film is basically the biggest ever used in a film, and it certainly adds to the film. There are plenty of shots of ordinary workers doing their job when mud and oil rumbles and rumbles until it finally blows. And it's presented without holding back. This is a very strong PG-13 film as you watch workers blown back, saved by their helmets; they desperately try containing the oil that blocks their vision and slips them up. I'm simplifying the action and don't want to describe everything that goes on, but trust me when I say that this film is engaging from start to finish. The climax was predictable, and therefore lacked some tension, but your heart will race as you root for the characters you spent the first half of the film getting to know. The movie won't revolutionize anything, but that doesn't have to stop it from being a solid film. It's a disaster film you will enjoy watching, only amplified by the well-known fallout that took place afterward. It's a testament to tell the story of real people in an unbelievably traumatizing situation, and for executing it with confidence and poise, I applaud the filmmakers and their efforts.

" I worked with Schlumberger as well as in offshore oil rig
",0.1531,0.3612,2018-05-27 00:00:00,7,"The movie is great as I can relate it to myself and my working environment. Since it is a dramatisation of a real accident, the director couldn't add extra things to viewer's taste. Many factual errors are there. It would have been better if they would have done some more research by some experienced personnel working in Offshore Oil rigs for the technical knowledge to make the script."
" Above all, a tribute to the 11 men who lost their lives
",-0.3182,-0.944,2018-04-25 00:00:00,7,"The film makers wisely focus their main effort on portraying the very real dangers involved in the offshore E&P business (even down to bird strikes that can play havoc with equipment) and how things can so easily go wrong, risking the lives of the people at the front end.
Unfortunately, they did fall into the trap of following the US business and government narrative at the time, throwing all the blame onto a foreign oil company that was making serious inroads into 'their' business. While not wishing to excuse BP from their significant responsibility, subsequent investigations have shown culpability in the series of errors that led to the disaster to be shared among a number of companies involved, most of them American.
Nevertheless, since the film mainly follows the technical complexity of the operations taking place and reactions under the severest stress, it is an action movie that stands as an effective tribute to those 11 men who died so tragically, as well as the heroism and professional competence of many of those who survived.
My main spoiler is to point out that the Wahlberg character, while representing a specific individual, actually incorporated several individuals on the platform and is shown doing numerous things that were actually done by others. Why can't Hollywood just recognise the heroism in most people, working together as a team, instead of concentrating it into a single superhero? This is supposed to be a 'real-world' event, after all!"

" Very solid action/disaster flick
",0.2247,0.9041,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Deepwater Horizon' (already sounds like an ominous novel!) is a disaster film about the BP oil rig off Louisiana, in the Gulf of Mexico, that blew up in 2010 and caused the largest oil spill in US history (800 million litres). Mike (Wahlberg) is the Chief Electronics Technician on the floating rig and they set-up his home life (Hudson is his wife and gets a few token scenes), as well as Andrea (Rodriguez), the helmsman. When they get to the rig, the Transocean rig workers - Jimmy (Russell) is the boss - are clearly distinguished from the BP visitors/owners, including Vidrine (Malkovich).The film is intentionally overt in painting BP as careless, profiteering ""sons of bitches"" and almost the sole cause of the disaster, which is probably not 100% accurate, but can't be too far off. Great line from Mike: ""Hope is not a strategy"". After 40min of setting the scene - with the set apparently one of the biggest ever built - the action begins and the pace doesn't slow at all after. There's some great underwater shots and the issues with pressure are explained well enough. The last hour is a hectic and tense amalgamation of explosions, gushing oil, people getting thrown around by explosions and Mike and Jimmy trying to evacuate everyone off the rig.This is Berg and Wahlberg's second film - after the great 'Lone Survivor' - and it's a well-made disaster film, with no dead air, not too much posturing, a likeable lead in Wahlberg, builds tension well and then has some awesome shots of the rig burning and exploding. Nice memorial at the end."
" A real disaster movie!
",-0.6588,0.8743,2017-12-31 00:00:00,10,"Deepwater Horizon There are some disaster movies that are straight up disasters.
Hollywood likes to feed us a steady diet of them.
Usually from the guys and gals that brought us Independence Day regurgitated or ridiculousness like Geostorm!Here director Peter Berg has brought us a fantastic film that tells the story of a real life disaster. An explosion that occurred in 2010 on the off shore oil rig named Deepwater Horizon, which created the worst oil spill in history.
Like I said, a real life disaster.
A story that is told by firstly introducing us to real life characters that are developed before any chaos ensues.
This is masterfully done by Berg and scriptwriters Matthew Sand and co to cement the audiences care for what happens to the lives on screen.
There's no hot shot scientists here played unconvincingly by Hollywood's latest Beef cake!
Instead Mark Wahlberg proves that he can actually act when he's not too busy getting caught up in Transformers nonsense.
We also get a commanding performance from the always brilliant Kurt Russell as Mr Jimmy, the man in charge.
Peter Berg takes his time setting the movie up before events unfold.
He gives the audience a chance to learn a little about oil extraction and the pressure that is applied by multi billion dollar companies wanting their payload.
John Malkovich gives a solid performance as the BP executive named Vidrine who is applying such pressure to Russell's character.
A great performance even if Malkovich's accent seemed a little erratic at times.When disaster does eventually strike it is incredibly staged and this movie looks and sounds fantastic.
The special effects are some of the best I've seen in recent years.
Sound design is ear shatteringly good. 
If like I, you missed this movie at the cinema, please watch this on the biggest TV you can find with a good 5.1 surround sound set up.
This film deserves that much.
Deepwater Horizon is as much as an immersive experience as it is good story telling.
The Dolby Atmos sound mix is a tool wonderfully utilised.
Picture quality is top notch too with rich colours accentuating the unbearable heat caused by the devastating explosions.
I thoroughly enjoyed Deepwater Horizon and this movie is proof that when done right a disaster movie doesn't have to be a disaster."
" Pointless Documentary with lots of explosions
",0.0,0.9365,2017-12-23 00:00:00,4,"A movie that focuses on a single binary event- the Deepwater Horizon explosion. The film avoids delving into the political, social, or ecological ramifications of the disaster and its aftermath. This is a major disappointment for me. The directors could have made so much more of this movie. The film stars Mark Walhberg as a technician who works on the Deepwater Horizon. Wahlberg's character has no special skills that are apparent or ever explained. He has no interesting dialogue. He sits around surfing the web and chatting with his wife half of the movie. When things go south, he suddenly morphs into a super hero with super human skills who saves lives. But I digress. Wahlberg's role in Deepwater Horizon is virtually identical to ""The Perfect Storm"". He has a Suzy-homemaker wife played by Kate Hudson who sits at home watching soap operas all day worrying about him while Wahlberg is out at sea trying to earn a paycheck for his family. It was like they carbon-copied his character from ""The Perfect Storm"", but changed the scenery to an oil rig. Other stars include Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Gina Rodriguez. Russell is the good-guy rig supervisor who the workers love. He is at odds with Malkovich, a BP executive, who only cares about corporate profits at the expense of safety and the environment. The most passionate scene of the movie involves a heated exchange between Russell and Malkovich, but this exchange is done awkwardly. It is not classic Kurt Russell. Both Russell and Malkovich have bizarre accents that are difficult to understand. Russell tries to speak with a Southern accent and Malkovich uses a New Orleans Creole accept. Both work poorly. It is nearly impossible to understand what they are saying, but you get the gist of their dispute. Gina Rodriguez's character is also a tech of some sort. There's really not much else to say on her. She is boring like Wahlberg. The other characters in the movie are background props. They are cannon-fodder. The characters do all sorts of tests that are never explained to the audience. You have no idea what is going on and it is never explained what caused the failure. The action scenes as the disaster begins are well done. Lots of blood, shrapnel, etc. There is a scene that looks like it was stolen right out of the movie ""Titanic"" where a worker is blown off the side of the rig into the sea and hits a propeller of some sort before bouncing off to his death. Overall, the movie is an easy paycheck for Wahlberg and Russell. They are asked to do very little as the film focuses more on explosions. With a letter effort, the writers could have added some scenes in the beginning and the end about the politics and environmental consequences."

" A look at the environmental disaster that everyone remembers.
",-0.6249,-0.6949,2017-11-01 00:00:00,8,"After watching a couple really awful movies this week I needed a movie like this one. This one I truly enjoyed. Based on a true story so it always gives the movie a bit more punch. Everybody remembers the terrible tragedy that occurred that day. Some would think it's a human tragedy but to me it's an environmental catastrophe. Millions of liters of oil devastating marine wildlife and this for decades. The movie doesn't mention anything about that, but it still remains a good movie to watch. Just to have an idea on what happens on an oil platform like that. That the big oil concerns like BP are faulty in every way is obvious. That they will never face consequences doesn't bother anybody. That's just the way it is. The mighty lobbyists win again. Mark Wahlberg gives us a good performance, as well as the other actors. The catastrophe scenes look like they are all real so for that the movie gets big credits. The story is poignant and will make everybody think about the disaster that happened there. A good catastrophe movie, even for the people that are not really into this kind of movies."
" Powerful Catastrophe Film
",-0.3818,0.9795,2017-10-02 00:00:00,9,"In this age, it is not easy to create films about catastrophes, without sliding into expensive but uninteresting CGI effects, or getting cheap and nasty. Deepwater Horizon is a very fine example of exquisite balance between excellent actors' performances (Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, Mark Walberg and Kate Hudson all show definite depth and sophisticated valor, depicting their parts decently and with a great gusto) and awesome CGI effects. Without going deeper into technical details, I have to admit the film has achieved its main goal - to show true heroism, valor, valiance and also cowardice and shallowness in the wake of doom and death. Excellent depiction of Lousiana nature, exactly right balance of mundane, tragic, heroic and stupid all add certain flavor to the very tough and nutritious broth of a film. I do recommend this fast, deeply tragic, decent and sobering film to all who want to think and would like to watch something serious and thought-provoking."
" ""This here's the well from hell, girl!""
",-0.5848,-0.0249,2017-10-02 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect the film to be that much of an action movie, even though the Deepwater Horizon incident remained at the national forefront for over three months. After the characters are established and the premise of the story is set, the semi-submersible offshore oil drilling rig known as Deepwater Horizon turns into a veritable fireball with employees scrambling for their lives, or in the case of the eleven who didn't make it, a final, forbidding resting place. There's just enough well drilling science interspersed throughout the story to guide the uninitiated about what happened, with a thorough indictment made against the cost cutting maneuvers of the British Petroleum honchos calling the shots. Besides what we see here, I was also expecting in some way the eventual successful effort that shut the oil spill down, but the picture really only followed the tragedy through the first few days until the surviving crew members were all rescued. One's visceral response to the blazing inferno that consumed the oil rig is tempered by the fact that this was a real event that claimed eleven lives. What's impressive is the mammoth undertaking director Peter Berg accepted when offered the challenge to make the film. Extra features on the DVD describe the formidable task, putting you right in the middle of the disaster."
" Corporate greed leads to disaster.
",-0.7783,-0.8889,2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"It's the second movie I see in a row where Mark Wahlberg is presented as the heroic average guy. Do all Americans see themselves as former underwear models? The movie was OK. First show how good and professional and real people are the heroes of the story, demonize the middle management who wants to get things done hoping it will all be OK and risking everybody's lives, express the idea that money hungry sons of bitches are to blame, then blow everything up.The film presents only the actual event, with lots of fire, explosions, blow outs and debris flying everywhere. The lower on the corporate ladder people are the more heroic they appear. That's dramatization for you. I would have loved to have a small part in the end dedicated to the BP cover up and the legal mess afterwards, but they kept quiet. I don't even know if it was all cleared up by 2010. However, you should look up Peter Berg's article about BP's interference with the movie. Just look for ""The 'well from hell' ‚Äì my fight with BP to film Deepwater Horizon"" and you'll find it.Bottom line: classic disaster movie, with a straight story of the event, rather than the entire political and legislative chaos that ensued."

",0.4404,0.9757,2017-09-18 00:00:00,10,"This is a dramatization of the events surrounding the explosion and BP spill of the Deepwater Horizon floating platform located 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The film centers around Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) the Chief Electronics Technician (according to his hard hat but he was an engineer) of the crew and to a lesser extended through Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez) an operator. The operation of the drilling is explained early in the film by Mike's daughter using a coke can and honey for a school project. Ominously the coke sprays out the top.We see Mike struggle to maintain a safe ship against the pressure of schedule and profits as they drill ""the well from hell."" He says, ""Every time I peel off a band-aid I find three or four more. "" He butts head with John Malkovich who had the honor of playing BP engineer and representative Don Vidrine, the film's bad guy. He helps explains things to Don by comparing safety to noodling.The special effects were pretty intense. Like so many major accidents, people want to deny they are happening until too late. The irony is that this unsafe rig was getting a safety award for being BP's safest rig. I shudder to think.In the end, the film has a brief tribute to those who lost their lives for oil and profits.Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity."

The pace gets faster until the big disaster happened. I was very impressed by the great special effects on the platform and underwater.

Congratulations to all the specialists and especially director Peter Berg that created an authentic documentation based on true events. I hope this nightmare will never happen again.

" Countless Explosions & American Heroics
",0.5267,0.8545,2017-08-30 00:00:00,7,(Flash Review)We all know the real story and this movie put you right in the thick 'oil' of it. The first half builds up the characters and their backstory so in the second half the movie can tug at your heartstrings as you watch them try to handle and survive the explosions and endless fires. Very good and realistic production and effects. It was really believable. The script was a little too narrowly focused. It is mainly about the worker's heroics and their escape. I would have liked to learn a bit more about why the drill failed. You get a little bit in a couple scenes but they could have added more time to flush that out more in my opinion. They also pitted BP vs the Deepwater crew as BP the cost-conscience big oil company vs the downhome American blokes. My understanding was BP was most at fault but Deepwater wasn't totally innocent of fault but this doesn't claim to be true to life so can't fault it too much. It was good and entertaining and emotional; an above average Hollywood blockbuster movie.
" Great to see this film made
",0.6249,-0.9819,2017-08-28 00:00:00,9,"I would have given this film an 8, but given the subject matter and that BP so negligently failed in their responsibilities along with others, to lead to this disaster and how important this story is to be told, I give it a 9. Unless you avoid news, you will know about the oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico 2010.Besides the loss of life on the rig, the impact on life in the gulf has been incredibly bad and will continue to be so for a long time. When corporations are given too much freedom to manage themselves, such a disaster unfolds. How many birds and fish and other life was destroyed ? and then the impact on all kinds of people whose livelihood depended on the region being in a clean state. This is an excellent film for all to see, young & old as a reminder of why government needs to do its job and keep things managed."
" Worth a Watch
",0.2263,0.9923,2017-08-24 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie about the 2010 BP oil disaster on the Deepwater Horizon platform and mainly concentrates on the events leading up to the explosion and the explosion itself.If I am being honest, it was a bit slow for the first half of the film but when the action sequences kick in, it was quite impressive with good use of CGI effects and rattles along at a good pace.My friends in the industry say its not accurate, however, for the lay person its OK - the acting is OK, the script is OK the effects are good. What is disappointing is that very little attention was paid to the consequences of the explosion like the environmental impact and subsequent court case etc etcOverall though, not a bad movie and an enjoyable watch - probably a 7.5 rather than a straight 7/10."

",0.2244,0.9763,2017-08-08 00:00:00,8,"A good movie: A time framed story which chronologically counts down of what happened with the infamous BP gulf oil spill! Who did what? Safety concerns, managements push for profits over safety and the suspicion that something was wrong! Great acting from the lead roles. Kurt Russell is the ever vigilant, all knowing alpha male safety consultant. Kurt Russell's character was a hard edge in a serious Charlton Heston way. Mark Whalberg is the family oriented caring professional loved by his crew. John Malkovich is the the push for it's costing us profits manager and is manipulative. The management team does not answer why the safety team's check was cancelled. Deepwater Horizon background of the rig, processes, and extras gave the realism of the oil platform. Berg directs the foreground and background of oil rig procedures and characters into a realistic disaster story so well, that Deep Water Horizion is hard to Watch! Eight out of ten. There is even an explanation that the well is so deep that the pressure of the earth and oil was too great for the dig."

If the director is able to capture the exact amount of reality needed for this kind of movies, then it becomes more than a film, but an experience that everyone should go through. Peter Berg does a brilliant job, I can't praise him enough.Everything from the character development scenes from the first act (which is surprisingly interesting and captivating) to the amazing visuals and controlled pacing, is near perfection. He gives time for us to care enough about everyone so that when the ""accident"" starts, we truly care about the characters and we want them to survive.I love that there's no time for us to breathe or have a more relaxed scene from the moment the mud kicks in because that's how they felt when they were in the middle of the disaster. I love that there's never a ""Hollywood"" scene, everything seems real and frightening. I love that the movie takes its time to explain how everything really went wrong, step-by-step, even if we aren't BP's scientists/engineers (there's a perfect analogy done with a Coke and a straw). I honestly love everything about Peter Berg's direction and I can't wait for Patriots Day (it seems that he's doing a ""true story trilogy"" with Mark Wahlberg ... great!).Speaking of him, Mark Wahlberg is amazing in this film as well as Kurt Russell. Both of them have performances so heartfelt and REAL, they really give everything they have into this movie and that just makes it even more fantastic. John Malkovich is also present and I gotta say: he perfectly captures the arrogant, stupid, ""bad guy"" from the BP company. I hate him, he's a total asshole. If he truly was like that in real life, well ...Deepwater Horizon deservedly honors the brave workers and heroes of that day. The story is detailed perfectly, the first act might be a little bit slow, but it compensates with the amount of characters that we care about by the beginning of the disaster. The performances are great (an Oscar for Wahlberg wouldn't be a surprise), the unbreathable pacing, from the moment of the first mud kick, is as real as it can be and Peter Berg's direction is flawless at all the other levels.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" I know, lets make a film blowing up an oil rig !
",-0.2003,-0.8988,2017-08-03 00:00:00,6,"Typical boring disaster movie. You know whats going to happen and it takes ages to get to it, wading through boring family story stuff. Also for 'based on a true story' it's remarkably vague who is to blame/what was the fault. A rather 'cliched ; it was the rich oil company penny pinching so avoided testing. Although the business sense of avoiding a few hundred thousand dollars for tests to protect a few hundred million worth of rig is rather bizarreMore clich√©, rather vague 'oil company' people on the rig, trying to override safety concerns By being so vague it came across as, yet another 'glib' ""based on a true story"" offering from the Hollywood BS factory. If they had been more decisive with the fault/blame it would have been more interesting. Presumably, though, they were scared of getting sued, so just went with the vague, shadowy 'evil oil company'. Mediocre - neither a terrible film nor a great film. Watch once and forget"

" A high-quality Hollywood disaster flick
",-0.6249,0.2741,2017-07-12 00:00:00,7,"DEEPWATER HORIZON is a Hollywood disaster flick based on a true story and filmed in the same gritty, hand-held style as something like UNITED 93 or CAPTAIN PHILLIPS; in other words, Paul Greengrass is a big influence. The film is gripping and engaging, cleverly building the tension early on with hints at what could go wrong and involving the viewer in some surprisingly realistic interplay between the characters.The worst thing about this film is the extraneous sub-plot involving Kate Hudson's at-home wife. She adds nothing to the story whatsoever, only serving to drag it down and spoil the pace at times. This leads to the film's opening sequence, which is literally the worst part of it, totally boring and without merit. The story should just have started with Mark Wahlberg arriving on the oil rig for work. Still, things only get better, and when the disaster occurs in the second half this is thrilling stuff indeed, hard-edged and complemented by strong CGI effects. Wahlberg is fine, but I found Kurt Russell to be the heart and soul of the piece. DEEPWATER HORIZON is miles ahead of rival fare like 2012 and SAN ANDREAS in terms of quality."
" More filler than drama
",0.0,-0.9913,2017-07-05 00:00:00,4,"In April 2010 the exploration oil rig Deepwater Horizon, stationed in the Gulf of Mexico, suffered a catastrophic disaster, exploding and being set on fire. This is the story of the lead-up to the disaster, the disaster itself and the individual actions involved, and the aftermath.More filler than drama - essentially a 40-50 minute short docudrama turned into a 107 minute movie. The remainder is just padding. Yes, I know, the idea is to engage you, the audience, by getting you to know and like the characters and thus empathize with them when disaster strikes, but here it doesn't really work. The lead-up here is dull, and the attempts at engagement overdone and overt. It also doesn't help that, having introduced you to all these characters, other than the main ones it is difficult to tell who is who when the tragedy unfolds.On that point, the action itself is difficult to follow. By trying to make things as realistic as possible, director Peter Berg also makes things more confusing, with dim/dark lighting and random, unexplained things happen. It becomes hard to tell which characters are involved or what the dangers are (other than the obvious ones, of course).While a tragedy, there's not enough detail and drama involved to make a complete movie, but it got made anyway."
" Excellent Portrayal of the BP Disaster
",-0.1027,0.3804,2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"As usual, Peter Berg does another excellent job keeping the audience involved in his movies. There were a number of individual personal stories and interplay between characters. What was needed was more names and titles as the main characters appeared on screen. It was difficult to hear and understand a lot of dialogue as the movie moved quickly along from scene to scene. It was important to me to know who the 11 who died were while they were on the screen. Having a brief name and title as was done with the lead actors would have helped us relate to those who lost their lives. Or perhaps in the end - show the actors along with the real pictures of the fallen. Great excitement and visual portrayal of a real disaster that should not have occurred. May God bless those who lost their lives. Very emotional in the end."

It wasn't as engaging as the producers may have indented. It definitely (still) pulled me in. What would make it ""engaging"" as well? That's up to you; for me I thought that while the jigsaw parts to engage me were present, the treatment was very superficial (even dismissive).Another point for me is technology -- An oil rig like that is MORE complex and sophisticated than any Nuclear Reactor. Perhaps you can't cover it in a film; you must however explain the critical elements central to the story itself. Things were going well until the absent concrete test report issue was miraculously supplanted by a ""Negative Pressure"" test. WHAT?! WHY? Motivation? Engineering? Science? Who explained how the release valve mattered more (or was a management fop?) Gaps in story telling. As I said I still found it grabbed me; may be I just need to read the court transcripts, etc. I definitely recommend watching ""Deepwater Horizon"" more than once."

But that's just theatrics, I understand. But why they had to direct the movie in a way so nobody can know what's going on, that's a mystery to me."

" Based on True events could have been more
",0.4215,-0.9683,2017-06-21 00:00:00,6,"Deepwater Horizon is apparently based on the true real life events of The Deepwater Horizon oil spill which occurred in 2010. This was both a financial disaster for BP, and an ongoing environmental catastrophe. Reportedly an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled out into the Gulf of Mexico over the 87 days that it took to plug the hole, leaving the sea a blackened wasteland of dead and diseased.Based upon real people Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) routinely boards the rig, leaves his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter on shore. On board the Deepwater Horizon, Mike and Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) bode ill tidings when they discover that the departing drill team left without doing a safety check on the hole. This film is entertaining at certain moments but as a whole, one must be invested in the type of film this is, which is a real based true events disaster film. With a large budget of over $110 million and only making over $120 million worldwide, this film did not make as much as the studios hoped for, or was not praised as much either, as they intended some Oscar nominations. Overall Deepwater Horizon has its moments but as a whole is quite boring, which is shameful because the film is quite well made and we can notice much research was done. The main problem is that they waited a few years too long to make and release this film, which is a reason for its flopping at the box office. As a rewatch 06/17/20 opinions remain same. The film starts off relatively slow as it builds then gets quite engaging. Overall the story as tragic of a disaster as it has been doesn't quite provide such an interesting tale."
" Deepwater Horizon
",0.0,-0.998,2017-06-11 00:00:00,7,"I remember seeing the short trailer for this film, I remembered the leading actor and that it was about an oil rig spillage and explosion, the real events that made the news in 2010 didn't even cross my mind at the mind, knowing this made it all the more worth watching, directed by Peter Berg (Welcome to the Jungle, Battleship, Lone Survivor). Basically on 20 April 2010, on oil drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, operated by private contractor Transocean, the workers begin drilling off the southern coast of Louisiana on behalf of BP (British Petroleum). Chief Electronics Technician Michael ""Mike"" Williams (Mark Wahlberg) and rig supervisor James ""Jimmy"" Harrell (Kurt Russell) are surprised that BP managers Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich) and Robert Kaluza (Brad Leland) have insisted that workers assigned to pump the cement, intended to keep the well stable, are being sent home early, without conducting a pressure test. While Mike prepares the drilling team, including Caleb Holloway (The Maze Runner's Dylan O'Brien), Jimmy meets with Vidrine and persuades him to conduct a test, but cement has already been poorly placed, this will only serve to weaken it more, but Vidrine is impatient waiting for Jimmy to confirm the results, he orders the well to be flowed. Initially the operation goes smoothly, but the cement job eventually fails completely, triggering a massive oil blowout, that overpowers and kills six workers. The oil is ignited by a chain of equipment malfunctions and a failed attempt to seal the well, five more workers, including Jason Anderson (My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee), are killed. The rig's navigation officer, Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez), tries to alert the Coast Guard, but she is overruled by her superior, Captain Curt Kuchta (Dave Maldonado), on the grounds that the rig is not in any imminent danger. Oil spews out into the ocean, a frightened, oil covered pelican flies into the bridge of a nearby vessel, the workers begin a frantic evacuation, Jimmy is still alive, but was seriously injured in the explosion, Mike rescues Jimmy and he takes control of the situation, but the rig cannot be saved. Aaron Dale Burkeen (Jason Kirkpatrick), a close friend of Mike's, sacrifices himself to keep a burning crane from collapsing onto the surviving crew, while Mike and Caleb rescue Vidrine and Kaluza and get them to safety. Night falls and burning oil lights up the area, the Coast Guard now aware of the incident sends a ship to pick up the survivors, with the lifeboats full, Mike locates an emergency raft, but is separated from the rig before he and Andrea can board it. The fire is burning out of control, Andrea suffers a panic attack, but she and Mike jump off the rig, just as the oil in the well is ignited and the rig is destroyed, they land in the water and are picked up by rescuers, who ferry them to supply boat the Damon Bankston. The surviving workers are reunited with their families in a hotel lobby, Mike suffers a panic attack when confronted by one of the angry killed workers' relatives, but his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) comforts him, the film ends with clips showing the aftermath of the disaster, including the testimony of the real Mike Williams, none of Transocean or BP were prosecuted, and the eleven men that lost their lives are shown. I only heard a few things about the oil spill on the Gulf of Mexico, including the strange ways they tried to plug the gap, using things like nylon tights, golf balls, rubber tyres and human hair, before they settled on cement, but now I know the real danger and fatalities that occurred, it is shocking. Wahlberg, Russell, Malkovich and all the other stars give convincing performances as the engineers trapped on the rig that goes from spilling oil into a blazing inferno, it is actually suitable that melodrama isn't ramped up, it is very realistic, with technical dialogue, it really shows the negligence of those taking short cuts for budgetary reasons, and of course you are completely caught up in the chaos of the disaster, that ended up with 200 million gallons of oil spilling, a plausible and most intense biopic disaster drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound. Very good!"
" Efficient, well handled but not completely satisfactory dramatisation
",-0.1381,-0.9469,2017-06-07 00:00:00,7,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In April 2010, on the titular oil rig off the coast of Mexico, the worst oil disaster in US history occurred, that cost seven lives and had enormous environmental and sociological repercussions for months afterwards. Peter Berg's film follows the story of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), an oil worker whose job has estranged him from his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) and young daughter. He and site inspector Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) raise concerns about the lack of training of the crew, and the inadequacy of the safety checks, but BP crony Vidrine (John Malkovich) insists the job goes ahead, leading to the cataclysmic disaster which they are lucky to escape from alive.Before this year's second Mark Wahlberg/Peter Berg true life tragedy drama Patriot's Day, they had made this account of a major disaster that occurred at the start of the decade, but still rings a solemn chord in the hearts of many today. Like the aforementioned film, it provides plenty of meat on the bones in terms of potential for making a film, a story of gross corporate negligence and blue collar sacrifice that was begging to be told. Whether it's been made by the most competent crew is for the individual to decide, but it's certainly got an all star cast at its dispersal to cover plenty of ground.Berg certainly succeeds in building up plenty of tension and anticipation of the main event, establishing some believable, accurate depictions of everyday, blue collar rig workers going about their normal business, slinging their normal slang/banter and venting their usual spleens. And when the big explosion does arrive, it still takes its time before enveloping into the big, earth shattering spectacle that it is even if, like Titanic, it's bad taste to think 'wow' about it, since it's a reflection of a real life tragedy. In spite of this, the characters themselves do feel a bit Hollywood stereotype, especially Wahlberg's impeccably selfless hero. It would also have gained a bit more dynamism if it had shown some of the aftermath of the tragedy, in the shape of the courtroom dynamics between the BP executives and the aggrieved workers/families. This would arguably have made for a more interesting film all in itself.It seems as if Berg/Wahlberg may want to make a franchise out of these dramatisations of real life disasters/heroism. He's not really the best director for it and he's not really the best actor for it, but their ambition to shine a light on the plight of the downtrodden victims is still admirable, and this is still an efficient and well handled effort. ***"
" Shallowwater Horizon
",0.0,-0.9804,2017-05-28 00:00:00,6,"Director Peter Berg gives us the story of the greatest oil spill in American history. He succeeds in delivering all the damage, but fails to showcase the impact. On the grounds of drama, A movie like Deepwater Horizon will only strike oil if it is constructed as a drama about human beings, rather than a two hour treatment of a Wikipedia article. It's not a bad movie, but it has no soul. Something is missing. Deepwater horizon feels like a two act structure for a story that warrants three acts. There is a distinctive beginning, a middle and then it's just ... over.In the first part, we meet our main character (Wahlberg), his family and his co-workers. He hops a company chopper for a short flight to the Gulf of Mexico, and onto a doomed oil rig. It is there that we meet the unfavourable oil executive (Malcovich) who orders drilling to proceed after conducting a drilling pressure test that yields unsafe results. The teams starts drilling, and then mother nature fights back; flames go up. While the real person was in fact charged with criminal inelegance, Deepwater Horizon relies on our knowledge of the outcome to make Malkovich seem like the kind corporate 'bad guy'; that Hollywood loves to hate. To make matters worse, John Malkovich gives a lousy performance with an accent so phony and untraceable that you'd think he came from a planet in the Star Trek universe. As for Mark Wahlberg, for the most part he is playing himself, but in fairness the script doesn't give him much. Once the oil rig starts to go up, Deepwater Horizon succeeds in conjuring up some peril, but the camera work and lighting are highly disorienting, so after a while these scenes get tiresome. There is a brief moment near the end of the movie that is memorable because it gives a hint of what is missing. A bruised and battered Wahlberg gets out of a car, squeezes through the press and in to a building where he is met by a man who asks him what happened to his son. When he doesn't get the answer he wants, he attempts to man handle Wahlberg. What Deepwater Horizon needs is a sense of emotion impact from the turmoil, because you are left wondering how the survivors repaired their lives. another half hour of material would have helped with this. the fact that the movie denies us this renders all the family introduction scenes in act one a complete waste of time.There is more to this story than Peter Berg is able to deliver."
" BP deserves the full criticism
",-0.4404,0.3609,2017-05-27 00:00:00,5,"Peter Berg's ""Deepwater Horizon"" would've been better had it concentrated directly on BP's irresponsibility and ensuing cover-up. Instead, most of the movie is more like an action flick, with explosions and people running in every direction. While the movie did make clear the executives' disdain of safety concerns, it should've shown the complete destruction caused by the spill, and how BP stationed armed guards to prevent anyone from filming what was going on. Not to mention CEO Tony Hayward's tone-deaf remarks (""The Gulf of Mexico is pretty big, so not much got damaged"" and ""I want my life back""). This unnatural disaster was a second major blow to Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. It should have been the indisputable call to reject fossil fuels.As for the movie's plot, Mark Wahlberg's character is the only one who really has any depth. The movie could have been so much more."
" Watch Out For That Traveling Crown Block!
",-0.4926,0.8598,2017-05-25 00:00:00,4,"I believe one of the producers was Mark Wahlberg, who also stars. Too bad. His writers and his own judgment failed him. When it comes to special visual effects it's possible to go too far -- and they have gone it.The first twenty minutes are kind of interesting. We get to know the characters, like a grizzled Kurt Russel who manages the rig, Wahlberg who is the chief electronic technician, and John Malkovitch, who is not one of the worker ants but rather seems to represent the suits who own the rig, Burns Phillips. It's a little hard to tell. It's a little hard to tell anything about the people or the operations or the rig itself. You see, I am only five years old and I need the pace of the exposition to be slowed down so I can understand the meaning of terms like crack block, feeder pump, boom, operative covering, and cement block. I'm smart, so I figured out p.s.i. all by myself. I never did figure out why some of the jiggling needles on the gauges caused concern while others didn't. Malkovitch is treated as the villain of the piece but I don't know why, since his suggestions sounded sensible enough to me. But then, though I'm smart, my intuitive faculty is impaired.There's a lot of bonhommie aboard the Deepwater Horizon, which floats and isn't set on piles, and which has a bridge from which the screws are operated and all that. It's really a big flat boat. There's even an attractive young lady who works on the bridge. Everybody knows everybody else and there are running gags expressing the extent of Gemeinchaft. It all reminded me of the opening scenes of ""The Perfect Storm"" except these blue-collar types are pretty well set. Life aboard one of these rigs is deliberately made pleasant for the crew, otherwise why would they work on them? The cuisine is described in other sources as four star. There's booze available too. Everything is as comfortable as practicable only no smoking.That's the first twenty minutes. The rest is a breathless explosion of CGIs and special visual effects. The wretched drill blows out and we see a gusher of mud and/or oil, which then is ignited and burns eleven men to a crisp, while wounding most of the others. There is no pause. The structure blows up piece by piece with no explanation of what the hell is going on. An hour of solid flame, terror, flying debris, and blood. As a five year old, I loved it. It's hard to imagine what other audience it's aimed at. It's just that even at my tender age it's possible to reach a point of genuine satiation. Of the performances, only one stands out. The bewhiskered Malkovitch is a magnetic Cajun speaking in a memorable dialect."
" Greasy Palms Spill Blood and Oil.
",0.0,-0.9178,2017-05-20 00:00:00,7,"Peter Berg's directing style is incredibly similar to that of Michael Bay's, no matter how much one tries to ignore it, Peter Berg makes it very difficult to brush off. This time round however, instead of always coming second to Bay in almost every way, when comparing Deepwater Horizon to 13 Hours, Deepwter Horizon blows 13 Hours out the water, so to speak... Sadly, Peter needed a budget 3 times higher though, to accomplish that.The build up in the movie and the character interactions, are very reminiscent of films like Armageddon, Transformers and 13 Hours... Peter Berg tried this before with Battleship, and failed dismally. This time though, it came across as a whole lot more natural... And, he has the cast to thank.Unlike Battleship, that was helmed by Taylor Kitsch, Brooklyn Decker and the oh so terrible Rihanna, Deepwater Horizon had Mark, Kurt, Dylan and John; nothing, but a talented cast all around.The rig explosion set piece was, amazingly wonderful. Cinematography was on point, even though there were quite a few mechanisms I didn't understand, that translated into visual jargon.While watching the movie, I wondered to myself; is Vidrine really in the wrong here? When arguing with Mr. Jimmy, he presented arguments that nobody could oppose, and on top of that, even suggested a second test, to prove his theory. But then I remembered, that, from the VERY moment Mr. Jimmy set foot on that rig, he constantly wanted to know the ""cement"" situation, because of how vitally important it was, just to find that, Vidrine and Kaluza were behind that suicidal decision to begin with.I appreciated that Deepwater Horizon didn't go on longer than it needed to. The directing was perhaps Peter Berg's best, the cinematography was on point and the cast, top notch. Why Kate Hudson was such a misrepresentation of Felicia Williams however, I guess we'll never know. Anyway, well drilled 7.5/10."
" real life explosion drama
",0.0,0.9659,2017-05-20 00:00:00,6,"This movie based on real events of the biggest oil spoil in US waters was pretty good. I thought it introduced the secondary characters as best it could, mainly the wife and kid of Mike Williams. The film even tries to relay to people via the kid's school project, what exactly is going on at the rig, but the whole kill line and pressure still didn't make much sense to me. Anyways the action was good and great special effects with all the fiery explosions. It'a wonder the whole rig just didn't explode right away with the gas in the air and most would have died. Instead 11 didn't survive, which was amazing considering all the explosions. FINAL VERDICT: Interesting topic and good special effects. Worth a viewing."
" Peter Berg Pulls It Off
",0.0,0.7577,2017-05-12 00:00:00,7,I really enjoyed this picture and will recommend it. Peter Berg had a factual event to bring to the screen and he did so without lots of Hollywood dramatization and kept to the facts. There is enough drama in the real disaster that it does not require embellishment. Mark Wahlberg once again works with Berg and the two seem to work well together. Kate Hudson got to work with Kurt Russell who she calls her dad as he raised her and it was good to finally see them in a scene together near the end. The event is well documented so I will not get into that but the movie gives you an inside view of what happened but not exactly why it happened. Suffice to say that BP Petroleum is responsible for the 11 mens deaths.
" The World's Most Boring Work Day With a Couple Explosions at the End
",-0.3804,-0.9507,2017-05-09 00:00:00,4,"Deepwater Horizon is about the drilling rig that exploded in 2010, causing the worst oil spill in US history. The movie is, despite being quite a big deal when the event happened, actually rather boring. It starts off with the characters all doing their job. And that's fine because we need to develop these characters, right? But the problem is is that it spends half it's total run time doing so. Meaning we get to see the main characters doing their job for a full 50 minutes before anything of real significance happens. So for the first half it's just kind of a terrible movie. It's so incredibly boring with nothing really going for it. Even when stuff starts happening though, it's still kind of boring. Sure everything's blowing up, but it never seemed like the characters were in any real peril. I know that they were in real life, but when it seemed like all they had to do was jump into the water and swim to the nearby boat, it didn't really seem like what was happening was really that perilous. Sure there were a few scenes that were kind of epic, as in the last 10 or so minutes, but that's not enough to carry an entire movie. That, and I was probably still almost asleep from the first half. Despite this, the make-up was pretty good, and so were the special effects. Visually, it is a pretty good movie, but as a whole not so much. Overall Deepwater Horizon was boring and uninteresting. It did a poor job of portraying how much danger the main characters were in, and while I know that in real life they were, the movie really didn't do it justice. In end I wouldn't recommend this movie."
" Despite lugubrious first half, chronicle of oil rig explosion and heroic crew member actions, hits the mark
",0.6862,0.9914,2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"If you want to learn about the greatest oil spill ever as well as the greatest environmental disaster in US history, Deepwater Horizon is the film to watch. The most incredible thing about this film is the set‚Äîa reproduction of the semi-submersible Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) which blew up‚Äîit's as if you're watching the real thing!Deepwater is basically a great technical achievement. As far as the story‚Äîa good part of it has a documentary feel. Our protagonist is the real-life Chief Electronics Techician Mike Williams played by Mark Wahlberg. Early on we meet his wife and young daughter and unfortunately the beginning of the film is quite lugubrious as there isn't much drama involving William's family life. Only after Williams ships out to the oil rig do things become moderately interesting. Director Peter Berg, utilizing inter-titles, informs us that the rig is run by a private contractor, Transocean, and led by the stalwart safety engineer, ""Mr. Jimmy"" (played by a convincing Kurt Russell). Ironically the day the rig blew up, Mr. Jimmy was receiving an award for his excellent safety record on the rig.A conflict erupts between Mr. Jimmy and the BP (British Petroleum) Manager Donald Vidrine (played by a not so recognizable John Malkovich). Mr. Jimmy wants Vidrine to conduct a ""pressure test"" which will ensure the stability of the entire platform. Vidrine really wants to cut corners and gives a not so plausible explanation as to why he feels the test isn't necessary.I've read that Vidrine actually didn't give the orders not to conduct the test ‚Äîthat was attributed to some other manager; ultimately, it was BP execs offshore who had the final word on that. But Vidrine makes a nice foil to Kurt Russell's character so there is a bit of dramatic license taken here.No need to go into great detail as far as the depiction of the explosion and its aftermath. Suffice it to say that Wahlberg does an excellent job highlighting William's heroic actions saving crew members as well as himself by jumping from the rig into water laced with burning oil.If disaster movies are your thing, then Deepwater Horizon should be for you. As a fitting memorial to those who perished (11 in total), director Berg makes good on depicting the sacrifice involved. A good half of the movie is exposition but there's enough heroic derring-do to keep you glued to your seat in the second half."
" Very good film
",0.4927,-0.5623,2017-04-25 00:00:00,9,"OK I hate the reviews everyone gives for this film. What did y'all expect when you decided to buy a movie ticket to go watch this movie. If you thought this movie was all about the economical side of it all then your stupid enough to realize that it wasn't. From the moment I saw the trailer I knew that Peter Berg was geared tired more of the life of the riggers and what happened on board of the rig and I knew he was gonna portray that. Did it seem like a typical Michael Bay movie, yes. I knew a fire broke out and all but what Peter Berg did was add all this big explosions and fire shooting at them and the camera shaky effect kinda made it a little bit non realistic in a way but still I bet that did happen on that rig and how the big fire erupted and caused a lot of destruction, we know that happened. The plot could've been better and well written I can give you that but acting wise I think everyone did a great job and Peter Berg put up an amazing cast for this film. It gets deep and emotional and it will cut right into you if you pay close attention. This film had my heart racing. Every second watching it and seeing how Mark would maneuver past those fires and how everyone was trying to stop the flood of oil and all these fires erupting from different places had me at the edge of my seat. What Peter Berg wanted for us to see and feel is there pain on that rig and what happened on that day on April 20th, 2010. He wanted us to feel there pain and have us at the edge of our seats just waiting to what will happen nextAll I gotta say is if there were more options for rating this film I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10 but since there is none I'll settle with a 9. I definitely recommend this to anyone"
" Disaster - for real

And it's amazing that they would not be afraid to lay out the blame. On the other hand it does seem a bit clich√© to call out a big company like that. And you really do need a great actor to represent that company so it doesn't fall short on many aspects (and the movie did a good job at casting one).It starts off pretty easy and slow, but early on you can tell that something is about to happen. Foreshadowing like at the breakfast table is almost not necessary, but it does add an extra touch. When the mayhem begins though, there is no stopping and the effects are up for it. It's breathtaking and heartbreaking at the same time."

Procedures, equipment names, technical expressions are too much for the common viewer. I guess the makers did a reasonable job with simple explanations in the form of subtitles such as 'negative pressure test'. 'A test to examine integrity of the well', a simple but effective explanation.Post explosion I liked the CGI details. That was when I realized why this movie has cost $150 million.Great movie."

A short course in oil drill operation would be a desirable pre requisite. The basic ideas were put as subtitles for the rest of us in the bottom left of the screen as a substitute for actually telling a story.The actual disaster is just a wild confusion of bangs and booms which are of themselves not particularly entertaining or enlightening. The bad guys wear white hats (which at least is novel) and even their part in the story is obscure.In short another example of bang crash boom with special effects instead of a real movie with plot or story to tell."
" Overdue movie, solid execution
",0.1531,0.9676,2017-04-04 00:00:00,6,"""Deepwater Horizon"" is an American film from 2016 that is actually based on an article and was directed by Peter Berg. Berg has worked with Mark Wahlberg on other occasions as well, so it is not really a surprise the two reunited for this one here. The film managed (a bit surprisingly if I remember correctly) two Academy Award nominations in the technical categories, but lost out to ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Arrival"". It runs for 107 minutes, but admittedly this includes almost 15 minutes of credits at the end, so the real runtime is just slightly over 1.5 hours basically and nowhere near Wahlberg's longest works. The title already gives away a crucial reference to the subject here, namely the oil rig catastrophe from April 2010, roughly seven years ago now. This is definitely a subject that deserves its own movie to let more people know about it, also for future generations in the next decades. The execution was okay overall. I agree that there are moments when the film becomes a bit generic and feels like it could have been about any other catastrophe too, but as a whole, it's still a solid movie.The film depicts the time directly before the catastrophe and shortly afterward. There is no emphasis on the massive environmental damage that was done. The first 60% of the film, i.e. everything before disaster strikes, were probably better because afterward it develops into a bit of a generic action film really, even if these later sequences probably resulted in the Oscar nominations. Then again, the first half has John Malkovich (and Kurt Russell), so naturally it is the superior part of the film. Wahlberg is okay as well, but sadly his character is a tad too perfect once again as he sees through the problems, is not scared of authority (i.e. Malkovich) and just turns into that huge savior at the end. But he is still a million times better than Golden Globe winner Gina Rodriguez in here, even if it is not really her fault as her character was completely insignificant and pointless the way it was written and probably only included to have any females in here at all. Then again, Oscar nominee Kate Hudson would have been enough as she does a pretty solid job too with the little she was given. She is the connection between Wahlberg's professional and family life in here and even if she is seen only on a webcam except very early and very late, she still manages to be 10 times as memorable as Rodriguez. All in all, the film is probably not as good as it could have been, but overall the focus was right and it's a good thing that it was made. I give ""Deepwater Horizon"" a thumbs-up and recommend it particularly to those with an interest in the subject or those who like fact-based action films or just those who like Mark Wahlberg and/or the supporting players. If neither description fits you, you can skip it."

The overall action and special effects are good, and gripping. But the big loss for viewers is the inaudible conversation. We couldn't hear much on our newer Sony Bravia with or without Philips sound-bar. So we watched it on our older Panasonic Quintrix TV (with LG DVD player), and that was A LOT better. However, I still had to ramp the sound up for some quieter conversations; and then down for the deafening explosions and other sound effects (chopper noise etc). In that sense it was one of the poorer movies we've ever watched. Maybe it was aimed at movie audiences...with ear-plugs. One of the other reviewers commented on the poor audio, as well. So we're not alone."

BP managers Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich) and Robert Kaluza (Brad Leland) are cutting corners and canceling vital tests. They push the delayed schedule which leads to a big explosion and environmental devastation.The action, the true-life story, and the characters are all very compelling. I rarely wish for more expositions but the film could use some to lay out the ocean oil drilling operation. Peter Berg tries to do a little with the can of soda. The film is not actually confusing but a detailed explanation could help lay down the foundation. This is more of an action thriller. The crew of the Deepwater Horizon is left blameless while BP and the two managers are made as the sole villains. I don't disapprove but it's a little simplistic. Overall, this would be a good disaster movie even if it's fictional."

They just wanted to tell the story. Not to create a hero nor a villain. But due to the casting, Mark Wahlberg looks the centre of the story. And also points out a negative character without confirming anything properly. But if the film is depicting the real incident correctly, then it was no man's fault. It should be a technical error that led to the man's push over the limit.It's April 20 2010 about 60 kms away southern coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico. A new batch arrives to continue drilling in the deep sea as part of oil exploration. When they felt they have got it, but it's only a back foot. Small small errors, following a big blow, the entire crew with the greater effort to stop it ends in vain. Finally, it is a matter of saving their own life than the drilling platform. With lots of action, how one of the biggest man made disaster in the recent time comes to end covered in the remaining part.From the director of 'Lone Survivor' and his part in the project was appreciable. It is another sea disaster theme like the recent 'The Finest Hours'. The film was mainly developed from the articles and also got nominated for the Oscars in two categories, but did not win any. Visual effects were the key for such film and I liked those parts. I appreciate for recreating the event for the world know what really happened.

It stars Mark Wahlberg, and this is right up his alley. However, the film seemed too long (it is not that long). The lead-up to the explosion was too slow and the technical jargon used during that section of the film did not help as I think it was lost on the audience in general. The draw of a real-disaster is understandable; however, this movie is nowhere near thought-provoking, political or anything like that. It does summarize some facts at the end, but those facts don't say much either. I do find it unfortunate that the movie was not made to be more thought provoking, but I understand that was not the focus of this movie. Unfortunately, by having such a superficial focus, the movie needed to be about a half hour shorter. The acting performances were fine, but nothing special."

The dramatization is fairly well done and the effects are believable as well as enjoyable. If you watch it as a disaster drama and special effects movie it is definitely okay.As a documentary, well I would say that it falls short. The movie only covers the initial explosion. Once the platform is evacuated the movie stops. I am somewhat disappointed at that. I would at least have liked to see the attempts to put out the fire. Where are the scenes with the boats trying to douse the rig with water for instance? I would also have liked the film to cover the attempts to close the well, the technical challenges involved and the fight against the oil spill. This is not at all covered.I feel that the film attempts to ride on public opinion, pretend to be a action/disaster movie as well as a fact telling one and cash in on the accident. The action/disaster parts were well done but the movie left out a lot of the, perhaps less spectacular, drama around the accident. It is a shame because now it became a rather ordinary movie as well as giving a distasteful feeling they were just trying to make some quick bucks on the disaster.That also made the factual parts somewhat in doubt. I feel the movie is making a strong effort to portray BP as willful criminals. I am sure there is plenty of blame that should fly BP's way but at the same time one can read that ""On November 8, 2010, the inquiry by the Oil Spill Commission revealed its findings that BP had not sacrificed safety in attempts to make money, but that some decisions had increased risks on the rig."". As always, things are not black and white and oil drilling is risky business after all.Anyway, enough ramblings, I found the movie okay, nothing more and nothing less."
" Too technical, too messy, and arguably too glorified
",-0.0516,0.9644,2017-03-02 00:00:00,6,"Here we go again, Deepwater Horizon is a film that claims to be based on true events. Indeed, there was an oil rig by such name that made a huge mess in the Gulf of Mexico. The question is, how close this film stays true to what really happened there on April 20, 2010.Because if we judge this film by its cinematographic merit only, then it could easily be described with a concise formula: a catastrophe flick, brutal but generic. The typical build-up, with lots of banter, friendly and not so much, and a ton of techie jargon you'll hardly understand even if you could pause every now and then and look up every word. And then the typical climax, when the hell breaks loose and everyone gets their chance to reveal themselves and to be either @ssholes or heroes. And the typical finale, grim but happy, with the survivors hugging their wives and kids and exchanging those meaningful looks. If that was the first disaster movie I had seen, well, I'd probably feel absolutely satisfied. Because the disaster part of Deepwater Horizon, finally devoid of the mumbo jumbo talks and turned into a big quest of survival in a burning hell above water, is definitely gripping enough, thanks to the solid performance of Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell, and the impressive visuals. However, I've seen such films before, both dramatic and ridiculous, so I'm bound to wonder whether Deepwater Horizon is able to bring something new onto the table.Unfortunately, the answer is no. Last year we've seen another catastrophe film based on a real story, Sully. Well, it was not a typical catastrophe indeed, more like a catastrophe turned miracle. Still, it was a demonstration of a different approach to telling the stories of such events. And while Sully was definitely less dynamic and much more political, it was at least original. And that is the quality Deepwater Horizon isn't really able to boast.If only we could only know how much of this film is fiction and how much is based on reality indeed. Because if the filmmakers had shot Deepwater Horizon strictly in accordance with the real events, then all that purely American heroism and even the techie talks would've felt... different. That way we'd actually be able to assess the scale of stupidity and greed of the people who let that disaster happen, and the scale of heroism and sacrifice of those who were doing their best to avert that disaster, and, when the worst finally happened, were risking their lives to save those of their fellow men. That would've been a true feat deserving every praise possible. But I know Hollywood. And, while I'd like to believe that some of the exemplary behavior shown in this movie did take place that day, I'm more inclined to think that Deepwater Horizon is just a rough outline of the true story, and all those inspiring and noble actions done by Wahlberg and Co are there just for the show."
" Peter Berg's most thrilling and emotional movie yet
",0.6436,0.9527,2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Peter Berg's ""Deepwater Horizon"" is a not only a movie on a great suspense level but it is also a movie of deep emotion and sadness with some aspects of the movie in which Berg uses to his advantage in order to make this into a very effective movie which is his best movie that I have seen since his 2003 film ""The Rundown"". The movie stars Mark Wahlberg in one of his very best performances as Mike Williams who is the chief electrical technician on an offshore oil rig called none other than the ""Deepwater Horizon"". The opening scenes of the movie are probably the most emotional that I have seen where he is talking with his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) and his daughter (Stella Allen) when he knows after he says goodbye to them it could be the last time he may ever see them. Once they get to the rig the person in charge of operations on the rig is a man named Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) whose job is to make sure that things are going smoothly at all times. Then Mike ends up meeting a man by the name of Vidrine (John Malkovich). As the film progresses things end up getting more suspenseful and the person who is watching the film ends up being on the edge of their seat because the oil pipe tests aren't indicating anything good and then all hell breaks loose and the rig is engulfed in flames. The movie was based on true events which makes me feel like while watching the movie that I was actually with the characters during the explosion. The most effective scenes are in the end of the movie where no words are spoken just shocked and saddened facial expressions and music which to me personally makes it one of the most emotional endings in a movie that I have ever seen along with ""Schindler's List"" (1993), ""The Green Mile"" (1999), and ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004). This was a very good movie and I am hoping to see more from Peter Berg in the coming days and years, this is one of the best movies of 2016."
" 'Deepwater Horizon' Shows Fury and Technique from Director Peter Berg
",-0.5719,0.9832,2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"Real stories about tragic events have the advantage of being harrowing without much effort because the accounts of the truth do much of the job for them. It takes a distinct type of filmmaker to raise the film above the standard. While director Peter Berg doesn't completely connect the dots, he promotes a tale of responsibility that will antagonize the wrath inside of all of us. ""Deepwater Horizon"" rallies emotion in the wake of truth.""Deepwater Horizon"" tells the tragic true story of the oil driller that due to negligence and fault of the BP Oil Company, created the worst oil spill in history.Mark Wahlberg is an actor I've tended to be harder on than most lately with his choice of roles. Here he puts forth a genuine, heartfelt portrayal. Always placing himself in the ""hero"" position, he manages to tap into a delicate enactment of a man desperate to survive. He gets to show off a new accent that isn't south Boston, while digging deep to show real emotion. It's his best performance since ""The Fighter.""The film boasts an all-star cast, some of which are doing adequate work. As the ship's captain, Kurt Russell continues to explore lively, vigorous roles in his later career. John Malkovich does all but twirl his mustache as the corrupt and pushy executive. Gina Rodriguez steps out of her ""Jane the Virgin"" motif to investigate a new, compassionate character and achieves a noble offering. Oscar nominee Kate Hudson plays the famed ""woman on phone,"" but in some cases, just ""woman on Skype.""Berg's direction has been problematic on bigger blockbusters like ""Battleship,"" but with penetrating and vital material he gets to show the world what he can truly attain. Arguably not as emotionally resourceful as ""Lone Survivor,"" it is perhaps cleaner in its assimilation of story and filmmaking technique. He runs the bases with his editing and sound team. They pulsate tension like there is an unlimited supply. Ingesting the central concept will undoubtedly infuriate the viewer as we're shown another key example of money corrupting our beloved Mother Earth.

" Define Hero
",0.5574,0.9931,2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"It's odd that this movie, DEEPWATER HORIZON, arrives on DVD this week. We're in the middle of a world where the definitions of words like hero or brave are being tossed about in the most ridiculous manner. Without saying she was right or wrong, Meryl Streep just gave an impassioned speech after accepting a lifetime achievement award and used her time to speak poorly of President Elect Trump. Afterwards people in Hollywood talked about how brave she was. She was speaking in front of an audience almost all of which agreed with her in a town that felt the same. That doesn't seem brave to me.What does seem brave are people who lay their lives on the line everyday to get the job done. What makes some of them even braver are the actions they display in situations of adversity. That's what this movie is all about.Unless you were living in a cave from 2010 on you are well aware of the decimation of the offshore oil drilling rig Deepwater Horizon off the coast of Texas that led to the largest oil spill in history. While most of us were concerned with what happened the focus of that story was on the oil spill itself and on the responsibility of the companies who owned the rig to answer for that spill. This movie takes that story to a different level and talks about the people who were on that rig.The movie opens with Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) at home as he's about to head out to the rig for a 21 day tour. He sits with his daughter and talks about what he does for a living, helping her out with a report she has to write for school. Saying goodbye to her and his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) he takes off for work.We also focus on two other people in this story of what happened. The first is Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez), dealing with a car she's rebuilding before going in to work. The second is Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell), the grizzled veteran in charge of the safety for the rig. The three meet up at an air base where helicopters fly them out to the rig to get to work.When they arrive things aren't going as planned. The construction of the rig is 40 odd days behind schedule. The team responsible for checking the concrete substructure is on their way home which upsets Harrell since he knows they didn't have time to do a full inspection of the rig. This brings about a confrontation between Harrell and the company men from BP led by Vidrine (John Malkovich). Vidrine, concerned more about the delays and the costs involved, insists that the test be run on the rig and it begin to pump drilling mud.Harrell concedes but before he can make sure things are running smooth he is escorted to a hall below where other members from the company bestow a safety award to him and a celebration is set, cake and all. Shortly after the party begins Mike heads for his work station and Harrell heads for a shower.When the inevitable happens, the foundation not being ready to stand up to the pressure involved, a geyser of mud, water and gas blow from the drill and disaster follows. Men are tossed about and wounded, including Mike and Harrell. It doesn't take long for things to go from bad to worse as the rig explodes and catches fire. Now it is up to the crew to do what they can to seal off the drill site and make their way off of the rig before they die.As I said the story is well known so there is no chance of spoilers with the exception of who makes it off alive and who doesn't. Sad to say that on that day 11 crew members lost their lives. In some cases it was immediate and in others they had an opportunity to display the heroism that is real, that means something at the end of the day. The film offers a nicely placed tribute to each of these men, showing their names and pictures just before the credits roll and before the names of anyone else.What I found unusual about the film is that with the star power involved none of the actors felt like they took center stage here. Perhaps Wahlberg could be said to do so because of the backstory involving his family and the fact his image was used to sell the movie. But all involved have a chance to bring to life this story of a tragedy on one hand and a display of bravery on the other.The pacing of the film might be a bit slow for some but we're not being offered a thought out story here. This is real life, this really happened and the events that flowed happened in real time not made up story land. While the movie is well made with some creative special effects put to good use, I'm not sure it's a movie you'll want to watch over and over again. It brings to life what could be painful memories for some. But it does need to be seen once in order to learn what real heroism is all about. It offers that story in spades."

I can not believe that it made it to the screen and even people paid for it. Of course it is terrible and very sad that men lost their life's. But why do these types of movies have to come out and try and sway public option? It said based on true events. Yes the rig did sink and people did die, but after that it was total BS and some kind of over budget special effects thing. I have worked offshore and taken kicks and even worked on well blowouts, but nothing like what happened here.

It can be about the events that leads to the spill, or it can be about how the spill was stopped.This movie is none of the above. Although it may seem like the movie explained the sequence that led to the spill, unfortunately it was explained in terms that most moviegoers won't understand. For example, do you know what a negative pressure test of the drill pipe is supposed to do? Or what a kill line is? Or the significant of ""mud""? Nothing is explained. All I know is a lot of people are doing a lot of stuff and eventually something went wrong. I assume the movie maker didn't really want the audience to understand what was going on, or else they would have explained in more detail.So what's left for the audience to understand then? A lot of explosion and people trying to escape. And there is really no ending. It's like watching a news footage of a fire.I have seen a documentary about this disaster and it was way more interesting than this movie."

The action and the drama that's conveyed in this film is gripping and Kurt Russell and John Malkovich definitely brought the drama. This situation was an ecological disaster and in one part of the film where and oil drenched pelican crash lands on the disabled rig illustrates the capacity of how terrible this whole thing was.

" True-life story realistically brought to life but avoiding the bigger picture
",-0.4767,-0.2017,2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Reuniting with his Lone Survivor (2013) leading man Mark Wahlberg and telling another true-life tale of down-to-earth, blue-collar guys caught up in a horrendous, avoidable situation, Peter Berg tackles the events leading up to and during the explosion of the titular Deepwater Horizon Mobile Drilling Unit and the subsequent offshore oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Berg opts to tell the story in the mould of a classic disaster movie, introducing the various characters that are inevitably destined to be caught up in the chaos, before delivering the movie's big set-piece; a massive, devastating explosion of fire and oil, dramatically and realistically brought to life by the 85%-to- scale set. While it makes for an entertaining and exciting picture (hardly necessities for a true-life tragedy), it misses the opportunity to explore the bigger picture.Returning to Deepwater Horizon after shore leave, engineer Mike Williams (Wahlberg) arrives at the floating rig to find that not all the workers are happy or comfortable with the actions of the company men. Mike and respected supervisor Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) are shocked to learn that the men responsible for conducting a pressure test have been sent home early under the orders of BP man Vidrine (John Malkovich), without carrying out the routine safety inspections. A lot of the dialogue is naturalistic but muffled, meaning that the necessary exposition required to understand the workings of the rig and the reasons for the pending disaster can confuse. One of the opening scenes sees Mike explain his job to his young daughter who is preparing for a class talk. She seemed to get it but I didn't, but it's clear enough that something isn't quite right.Berg's decision to keep the CGI trickery to an absolute minimum certainly pays off, and allows cinematographer Enrique Chediak to capture the sheer scale of the event to full effect. While there are some invisible special effects at work, the whole ordeal feels entirely real, bolstered by some terrifying, Oscar-nominated sound editing. Yet in aiming to deliver an action movie so focused on the immediacy of the event and the swift actions of those on board, it loses sight of the bigger picture at play. Namely, the unforgivable misconduct and irresponsibility of BP, who endangered the life of every man and woman on board in fear of being behind schedule, and the resulting oil spill which devastated wildlife and could be seen from space. For me at least, that sounds like a more interesting and engrossing movie. Still, Berg's picture is well made, handsomely performed, and, most importantly, doesn't feel superficial."

However, it is very entertaining, has wide appeal, will make you laugh, have you on the edge of your seat and might even make you cry. It's a slow build at the beginning but the tension soon rises and you will then be hooked. Deepwater Horizon is a movie that succeeds on two levels: as an action-packed blockbuster and as an honest depiction of a tragic disaster. It's the story of the BP oil rig that exploded and contaminated the Gulf of Mexico. It is great movie.On April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon, an oil drilling rig operated by private contractor Transocean, is set to begin drilling off the southern coast of Louisiana on behalf of BP.

" No spoiler alert needed ... the oil rig turns into a deadly inferno
",-0.128,-0.9897,2017-01-19 00:00:00,6,"""The Runner"" was about a congressman who tried to provide financial support for local fisheries after the BP oil spill. ""Deepwater Horizon"" displays in a consistent manner the pure facts on the day of the fatal accident with this oil platform. It could have been just another disaster movie, like I've seen a lot before. Full of heroism, spectacular scenes and emotionally charged images of families at home, waiting for some good news. Ultimately, it wasn't that kind of a movie. They managed to make a film without any Hollywoodian, exaggerated situations. In short, no tricks to make it more spectacular in terms of action and emotions. It's an accurate reporting of the facts that took place before and during the disaster. Sometimes I feel like watching an action-soaked disaster film where people end up in a very explosive situation, both literally and figuratively. On the other hand, I would have enjoyed a piece about the aftermath of this disaster as well.As in any disaster movie we get to see two different groups of people with opposing opinions. First we have those who predict the danger and who tried to point out to the others what consequences will result from making rash decisions. And then there's the other party rejecting any danger and trying to nip any protest in the bud, which ensures that the whole situation derails. In the group of individuals who are using common sense and where safety is top-priority, we find Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) and Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg). Harrell is a hardened foreman on the rig, who insists on checking the cement layer that'll protect the rig against a blow out. You don't have to be a genius to know this test isn't carried out properly and what consequences it'll bring. Mike Williams is the technician who's responsible to make sure everything that needs to function will function perfectly (including the toilets). It's no surprise he transforms into the person who keeps his nerve when the trouble begins and acts in an effective way to prevent worse.The sad thing about films like ""Deepwater Horizon"", is that the outcome is already known in advance. It's quite annoying when your wife peeks around the corner once again and calmly asks the same question over and over again : ""And? Is it already happening?"". But isn't that the moment you're waiting for in the first place? The moment the mayhem starts? The prelude only has an educational purpose (with a can of Coke explaining how drilling oil from an platform works) and merely serves to gradually build up the tension. When hell breaks loose, you'll witness a chain of explosions with such destructive force that walls, iron structures and workmen literally fly away in all directions. There's nothing so annoying as when you're enjoying a refreshing shower and the wall blows up right in your face with broken glass and twisted iron leaving a trail of destruction and death. That's what some of the crew members experienced the first minute.Mark Wahlberg plays a terrific part as the indifferent technician Mike, who isn't is impressed by the rather authoritarian tone used by the big shots from BP. I'm not Wahlberg's biggest fan, but now I felt like this was a suitable role for him. Ditto regarding Kurt Russell who stands his ground against these BP representatives. John Malkovich (who I always will remember as the provoking Russian poker-player Teddy KGB in ""Rounders"") plays the arrogant, pedantic BP man who at first acts extremely haughty and self-confident. But when the sh*t hits the fan, he runs off like a scaredy-cat, realizing he escaped a certain death. He looked like one of these male passengers who sneaked in the rescue boats with the women and children when the Titanic hit that giant ice cube. Pathetic.Don't expect much profundity in this movie. No blame directed towards the managers of BP whose only concern is to make a profit. That's more important to them than the safety of the staff. No epilogue in which these bozos are held responsible for one of the largest environmental disasters ever. And no real character development when talking about the main characters. The only goal they had in mind, was to escape from the flames and survive. But the special effects, action sequences and nail-biting race against the clock will blow you away. Exactly what the crew experienced.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" Deepwater Horizon Movie Review
",0.0,0.9917,2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Add to the line-up of disaster films that actually took place, Deepwater Horizon in my opinion is like Titanic, if you took out the romance between Jack and Rose. Peter Berg proves he has talent and should stick with films like these. However, it wasn't perfect by any means. It's about as rhythmical as a disaster film gets. The story is pretty basic, we know the beginning and the end. All we care about is the in-between scenes. And, it delivered but not on a scale like Titanic, where its literally an hour of nonstop chaos. The film is realistic in it's interpretations. That's not a bad thing, I actually praise it for that. In that it didn't add a clich√©d romance, or explosion upon explosion. So, truthfully I'm kind of in the middle of the road on this one. It's interesting, but not nail-bitingly intense, it's nicely realistic and serves the event well. It's a good film but not spectacular, but I hope to see Peter Berg back to direct another one of these. Enjoyment is present, and everyone does a fine job. I guess what I'm trying to say is, to me it was underwhelming. But kudos to Berg for tackling such a sensitive topic that just recently happened in 2010.

" The best disaster movie ever made
",0.0258,0.9527,2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"DEEPWATER HORIZON is about as good of a disaster movie as I think I have ever seen. Recounting the tragedy in 2010 in which an oiler rig caught fire and claimed the lives of 11 men on board, the movie follows the events in sequence as an ensemble cast brings to life one of the most horrific events I think I could ever imagine. Stuck in a fire is bad, but imagine being stuck in a fire 45 minutes from land, with the ocean 3 miles deep below you? That's terror.The movie is told from the perspective (mainly) of one man, Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), who is now regarded as a hero for his quick-thinking and rescue of several of the crew on board. We are introduced first to his family. His wife, a stunning Kate Hudson, and his whip-smart daughter who wants her dad to find a fossil at sea for bragging rights at school. Before Williams leaves at work, the daughter demonstrates the way an oil rig works using a can of soda and a metal straw. Like that scene in Titanic where a computer generation simulates the entire sinking of the ship so that the audience knows what to expect, so does this throwaway scene give us a rudimentary knowledge of the happenings on the rig later on. When they are talking about cement and pipes and negative pressure, we have less cause to question what is happening. It's brilliant filmmaking.On board, we meet the rest of the crew, captained by Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell), who argues constantly with the BP executives on board about cutting corners. The construction of the pipeline leading to the ocean's floor is already 43 days behind, and construction is abruptly finished to cut corners and save the multi-billion dollar company a little money. BP is, of course, the villain of this story since their actions led to the largest oil spill in US history. The face to the company is John Malkovich playing a conniving investor with a Cajun accent and knack for time saving. His dialogue with Russell is great, and we see the rival sides of two arguments: the crew is trying to work in the safest environment possible. BP wants the job done on schedule.The events on board play out in the course of 24 hours or so. We meet the workers on board, all chummy and casual with each other. They practice songs with each other, joke, work like friends... The atmosphere is that of comfort, and there is lots of clever writing in the way small talk turns into startling character development and the candor of speech places these characters so specifically in southern Louisiana.All the while we see bubbles slowly rising from the ocean floor, an omen of what is to come. When performing a standard 'negative pressure test' to gauge the strength of the newly-built pipe, a surge of pressure forces mud and natural gas to erupt into the Horizon with the force of a bomb. The facility fills with gas, and the overdrive of engines causes an explosion. In the darkness, we see massive amounts of black oil rise into the sky thousands of feet above the platform. With a spark, it is ignited... The entire ship is a floating firebomb.Luckily many survive, and the action once the flames start is less plot driven and more or less a fight to escape. With Mark Wahlberg's character, he is knocked unconscious in his bed chamber and must work through the darkness to find safely. Kurt Russell, caught in the explosion in the shower, is nearly blinded and impaled by shards of glass and metal. It's utter chaos.The most effective aspects of this film (and there are many) is the set piece of the Deepwater Horizon, itself. It has been called the most expensive movie set ever built, and watching the movie I would never have second-guessed that this was not a real rig that has been long weathered and worn. We learn it is not anchored to the oceanbed but rather a floating raft of sorts that uses propellers to center it constantly above the delicate pipeline bringing oil to the surface. Without propellers, the craft shifts off-centered, risking the pipe bursting and oil flowing freely into the ocean. In a moment of absolute startle, we are with the pilot in the control room when suddenly all power goes out. The silence is matched in terror by the instant knowledge of an oil spill unlike anything they had seen before and the dire need to regain power of the motors.This is surely an intense film, but it is matched equally with heart, which is an aspect I think many disaster movies gloss over in the end to create a cookie-cutter ending with a bow on top. Here, when the survivors are rescued and brought to safety they are not happy and cheering to be alive. Mike Williams breaks down on his hotel room floor and is unhinged by the horror he had just lived. Families become angry in an attempt to locate their son or daughter on board. Yes this is a true story, and the filmmakers respected the subject enough to give it a bit more weight that a typical blockbuster might have bestowed.It's hard to rate movies on a scale since it's purely objective and driven by emotion. Deepwater Horizon may not be a perfect movie, and it may have slight flaws, but the feeling of immersion into the story and the characters left me breathless from opening to the final credits. The visual effects add to the story and create images that I won't soon forget. The final moments brought a tear to my eye. From the movies I know are currently playing in theaters, this is the one movie I would want to go back to a second time."
" A Good Depiction Of What Happened On The Rig
",0.34,-0.8826,2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"When we think of the Deepwater Horizon incident I suspect that most people tend to think of the massive leak, that leaked literally hundreds of millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of several weeks before the leak was sealed. It was one of the most massive environmental disasters in American history. What doesn't stand out in my memory, though, is what happened on the oil rig itself. This movie tries to fill in that gap, and does so admirably.Much of it is told from the perspective of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), the chief electrician on the Deepwater Horizon. It opens by giving us a glimpse of his family life (enough to make this a very human and poignant story, but it's not overdone.) Once on the Horizon, we're introduced to various crew members, as well as a couple of executives from BP, who own the rig and the well. There's a lot of technical content, much of which went over my head, but I wonder if that might have been very deliberate. I may not have understood exactly what was happening, but I understood clearly enough that there was a problem building. The early tension comes from conflict between the crew (especially ""Mr. Jimmy"" - the captain, played by Kurt Russell) who know something isn't right, and the BP execs (the most important played by John Malkovich) who push the crew to keep going because their primary concern is that the project is over budget and behind schedule. When money takes priority over safety the result usually won't be good. In this case it's not. The well explodes, the rig is caught up in a massive fire, and the crew is left in a desperate struggle to survive.Everything is very well portrayed and the cast does a very good job of drawing the viewer into the story and making you care. I've never been on an oil rig, but the set seemed authentic and gave the viewer the sense of being there. The buildup of tension is well done and once disaster strikes this becomes fast-paced and exciting. Peter Berg did a good job directing. Well done all around."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.6614,2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Given the fact that this movie is about a tragedy, both on the human side but also on the environmental, maybe the word ""amazing"" is not the best to entitle my review. But in any case, this movie is really worth watching. It's about the courage needed to face adversities and come out of them in one piece. But it's also about standing up for what you believe to be true, no matter what others might say. This movie was about the worst oil spill in the history of the US and at many points it's really shocking. I particularly felt my stomach in a knot when this seagull entered the bridge of the ship near the rig. Mark Walberg was amazing but Kurt Russel was also breathtaking. I was also impressed by all the mechanics and technology involved in the process which are usually a black box for people that are not involved in this business. Overall, a really informative movie with some really interesting acting from all the actors involved and of course a really inconvenient truth that has to become a lesson for all of us."
" Realistic disaster movie
",-0.6249,-0.9668,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Peter Berg has produced an excellent disaster movie that tells the story of the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. What is really extraordinary about this film is its sense of realism. You really do feel like this is how it must have been. There is nothing movie-ish, cheesy or off in this movie.Enough time is take in the film to build the disaster up so we know what's happening. Woven into the account of this huge disaster are enough human interest stories to make you care somewhat about these people. This is a guy movie, so you get Wahlberg, Russell and the others doing their thing on the rig. Not really a chick flick at all.Berg doesn't fail to point fingers, but I think more could have been said about oil rigs in general and the environmental disaster that ensued. Sure, you can blame individuals, or companies, but the real problem is much wider than that. WTF are we doing sucking up the earth's resources with rigs like this? The patriotism aspect of it, albeit muted, was a little strange to me. Americans somehow can feel patriotic about a monumental disaster like this. Not sure what that's all about."
" Not a bad movie technically, but feels disrespectful towards the real people involved in the tragedy
",-0.7331,0.6025,2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie. I wonder how the families of the deceased in this tragedy feel about the dramatization of the oil spill. Because I'm pretty sure the average moviegoer did not see the movie as a means to paying respect to these dead. This is a disaster movie with explosions, and that's why the studio thought it would be worth spending 110+ million dollars. The movie feels a lot like ""Final Destination"", without the supernatural elements (the levels of violence are pretty much the same, even though Deepwater Horizon is shockingly rated PG-13). The ""Final Destination"" feel would be fine if this was fiction, but to have the memories of real people turned into a spectacle that works like the 6th installment of a horror franchise is not exactly tasteful. The performances are OK, direction is OK, all around an OK movie if you can ignore the morality issues (which I can't)."

We can safely say there is no thrilling in the movie.The master of this peace is Peter Berg who I really like his work in this movie, I Liked his way in picturing the mechanism of the machines which will get you really confused as your are supposed to be. He make some amazing scenes by connecting the characters together where there emotions combine.I am going to talk about Mark Wahlberg who I was really impressed for especially in the last few scenes which he did in an Academic way, I was totally impressed. I can't also forget Kurt Russell who did one of his best roles this year after being amazing last year in ""The Hateful Eight"".The screenplay writer chose not put any twists or fake events in the story to respect what really happened and I totally respect that.My rating is 7.5/10"

For example ... when those valve bonnets started to give out ... they should have evacuated. There was a conspicuous absence of alarms going off? Of course I've had experience with machinery ... hollyweed has not.Then there seems to be a distancing from BP by bringing up the ... 'it's BP's oil well ... but not their rig'. The phones don't work? The monitors go 'blue' and this thing was still in service? US ships (Oil Tankers for example) have the ABS and USCG regulating them. Do these rigs have anyone (standards) to answer too? There is a on-the-fly 'hand off' meet on the helio deck? That nobody can hear because of the noise? The bang-boom-whoosh CG was good and the 'Die Hard' like scramble to survive was entertaining enough.There is an entertainment value to this movie ... so, $6? OK. Still ... the the 'oil spill data' at the end was bogus. There was a complete absence of the 'dispersant' BP, tried to hide, used to dummy up the spill numbers and - in the process - poisoned the gulf of Mexico? Oil spills are measured on the surface. So ... braking the oil down and getting it to 'mix' with the water keeps this number ... and the penalties ... down.Whether is is BP or Transocean ... it was still a matter of protecting their collective 'bottom' lines. This did not have to happen."
" Now this is a good movie about a real natural disaster!
",0.1511,0.9909,2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Here was a movie that I was hyped to watch. I mean it has some bad ass actors in it, plus it's about a natural disaster that still has impacts on the ecosystem and society still to this day. We get to learn about a stupid company and watch a great movie at the same time. It's a win win right? Hmmm.Pros: This movie had some great dialogue and scenes throughout, not to mention the acting was great too. The action scenes were done nice and had some spot on music to go with them. It was like you where watching it happen when it happened, it was a cool an angry experience. The moments when Kate Hudson was in the film she did a great job with her emotions. Director Peter Berg is coming along very well as Michael Bay 2.0. Cons: Dammit people why not over 2 hours long. I can think of 3 or 4 more scenes that could have been added into the film to make me go from an 8 to a 9 instantly. Honestly like I said Kate Hudson was so good during her scenes she deserved more of them too. Some of the music was re-used for a few action sequences, made it seem like I was watching the same scene twice."

",0.25,0.9554,2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"""We are a big company, millions of moving parts. We all work very hard to ensure those moving parts are functioning as a means to a very profitable win for all of us."" Mike Williams (Wahlberg) and Jimmy Harrell (Russell) have just landed on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig and have discovered tests weren't run like they were supposed to. Now, up against the executives from BP, and over a month behind schedule a choice must be made, agree with executives, or go with their gut. The decision resulted in the largest oil spill and one of the biggest disasters in US history. This is a movie that is just flat out exciting and entertaining and extremely fast paced. Politically, the movie is really one sided and portrays the oil executives as money hungry and willing to risk danger for a profit. I'm sure that was part of the case but maybe not to the extent portrayed in this film. That aspect aside, this is one of the best disaster movies made in a while and one that I highly recommend. The action is quick and relentless and a movie that should be taken as entertainment and not fact. Overall, a super exciting and entertaining movie that is a must watch. I give this an A-."

",0.0,0.4588,2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Deepwater HorizonThe best part about offshore drilling is that you get to wear your swimsuit to work.Mind you, the rig crew in this drama should've worn flame retardant trunks.When drill crew captains Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) and Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) board Deepwater Horizon, they discover the proper safety measures have not been taken to stabilize the well. Concerned, they urge their BP rep (John Malkovich) to authorize a pressure test.Shortly after the test commences there is a massive explosion. Now Mike must evacuate his team (Dylan O'Brien, Gina Rodriguez) before the rig collapses.Inspired by the 2010 BP oil spill, this harrowing survival story is certainly heart pounding and inspiring. However, the human component feels aggrandized, while the environmental devastation has been minimized for the sake of high-octane entertainment.Even worse, under maritime law all oil spilt into the ocean automatically becomes the property of the mer-people.

I can't believe the facts though.87 days of issues out there off the coast of Louisiana...damn.when the movie opened I was waiting to hear if this deployment was off the shores of Sarasota Florida or Galveston Texas... Then boom.Louisiana. the coast guard and satellite location and visuals were super entertaining...I even caught a cameo glimpse of director Mr.Berg dressed up in a business suit.

" Good but slightly blown out of proportions on certain scenes
",0.5574,0.4915,2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"From a general perspective I would say that this was quite a good movie trying to relate facts that were unfortunate, not in fiction, but this time in the real. It shows a reality in which unfortunately a small group of fortunate rich guys are willing to talk only profit or revenue for themselves at risk of people losing lives. For whatever reason, I would guess that this is a common case in the petroleum industry.From a overall perspective I found the acting to be good and story to be captivating. Quite frankly, there are many times where I ranted, felt pity, sadness or concern -; and I would guess that these are the types of emotions that make you realize that the movie was particularly interesting.The action scenes were overall quite dynamic though some were a little bit pushed to the limit.The end is probably the most gripping from an emotional standpoint. It definitively makes you realize the amount of suffering and pressure in which ""black gold"" puts some individuals for the sole purpose of consumers who then spend a large spectrum of their lives enjoying the destruction of our planet through pollution. This movie really makes us realize that we do not deserve that and should almost certainly take another kind of direction."
" Biggest Event Horizon
",0.0,0.9753,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Ahhh, this movie reminds me of when I was on an oil rig disaster and we were trapped with little oxygen left. Suddenly a man¬Öa man literally on fire¬Öshowed up out of nowhere and led us to the Coast Guard's helicopter. But, we wouldn't have made it out alive if he hadn't single-handedly held up the metal tower that would've surely crashed down on the transport¬Öand us. He stayed behind so we could escape. What a super-man he was¬ÖOh, shoot. That was Man of Steel. This was real life.My biggest regret in this movie was that I did not see it on the big screen. Well, okay, that and me making a poor joke reference up-front on an incident that claimed eleven lives and destroyed a tremendous amount more in the 3-month spill following. The first half is setup leading to an inevitable disaster. Backing up, sadly, I didn't know any hardcore details of this incident. I knew of giant man-made oil spills and a BP-caused catastrophe(s,) I just didn't connect the dots here. It was just obvious from the get-go: this won't end well.At any rate, normally when I watch a disaster-film, I am generally impatient and want to get to the goods. As soon as possible. Not this time, though. I found the first 50 or so minutes fascinating. A day in the life of these drillers and the technicalities of the oil drill rig was quite interesting and both believably and beautifully shot. And then. Then the mud hit the fan and the movie gets enormously and horrifically brutal. And the movie never lets up. I already felt this was well-shot, albeit a grown-up Michael Bay film. And it continued to have great cinematography through explosions, massive damage and heroism. Again, it sounds like a Michael Bay movie, but again, it was far more mature filmmaking than that man-child will ever achieve.Yes, I wish I saw this on the big screen and I wish more had. This movie was incredible with its grand-scale spectacle of the rig going haywire around these workers. But the movie is not without its flaws.Yes, there are big-bad businessmen out there who make colossal-sized mistakes¬ÖI know of a few in the many jobs I've had (though, not to cost lives, mercifully) and these were a tad over-the-top. And on the flipside, while I wasn't there, the heroism touched on the Man of Steel reference I made above. I truly hope this is what happened ‚Äì the men going after other survivors to save lives and the ""Captain"" more concerned about his crew than his potentially life-threatening injuries. I got past my own negative thoughts and even couldn't help but tear up at the end. Thankfully, the movie knew when to quit and not make this an unnecessary and padded three-hour, overblown (no pun) drama. It had just enough screen time to introduce and fascinate us, take us through bad- decisions/bad-outcomes and give us the on-screen facts I was looking forward to thorough. Especially since I was completely ignorant on these events.Highly recommend this action/true-life film. More so for people with a HUGE entertainment center at home since it was sorely missed on the big screen. ***Final thoughts: When I first heard the premise and especially since it was a true story of an oil rig tragedy, unfortunately, I dismissed it as ""not my kind of movie."" EVEN with my knowledge of the film starring John Malkovich, Kurt Russell and Marky Mark. This all when it was in theatres. Trust me¬ÖI'm gonna rethink my life. This movie already impressed me wholeheartedly at home. It would've blown me away on the silver screen. (Again, no pun.)"
" An excellent movie, please you must watch this one
",0.7184,0.9635,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Deep water horizon is a movie that is supposed to be reviewed as a whole package and not individualized performances of the actors. Its an excellent film that slowly builds itself up from the beginning and as it precedes towards the end,it establishes a connection with a viewer that almost makes you idealize on what exactly happened on that oil rig in 2010. The thing i like most about this film is that i do not know anything about oil drilling,but the director has found a way to translate the complex engineering stuffs that goes on the oil rig to the extent that a layman like me has almost a complete understanding on what went down. The film also has proper execution of the action, that feels real, as in am not sure if they used CGI or they were actually performing the stunts.Without forgetting an excellent depiction of life of a human in different life situation, the film has good arguments you can almost feel the tension between the characters, true depiction of family love, dynamics and it has carried itself well when it comes to the emotional aspect that it might make u cry. This is a must watch film and it has definitely gone into my ""movies of all time"" list"

Here is a simple test to determine if you will like Deepwater Horizon: ""if you had to watch Titanic again, and you get to pick whether to watch only the first half, or only the last half, which one would you choose?"" If you pick the second half, you will love Deepwa... DH.DH is all about how a bunch of idiots from BP (and some friends of theirs) managed to mess up a simple enough operation, and wound up causing $41Billion of losses just to save a few bucks on a couple extra days of routine work (which would have netted them something in the region of X billion dollars SOLELY IN THE DAYS when the hole needed to be plugged).Mark ""Matt Damon"" Wahlberg is a nondescript, hillbilly-speaking engineer which has a non-relevant role in the story; he says a couple things, then goes to take a shower. When stuff blows up, he saves the girl by being the Hero(tm), in one of two completely unnecessary scenes which holliwoodize the film.John Malkovich is the BP aforementioned idiot, who causes the loss of the rig. No spoiler, as this is evident from page 1.Many, many supporting actors doing a fine job.The real spectacle is the set, with the rig going on fire, seems absurdly real. The film is a bit too long, there is NO need at all for the initial half hour (Wahlberg's wife establishes that Wahlberg has a reason to live other than, you know, get the f* out of a burning oil rig), but once the explodin' stuff starts happening, you will be in a trance.I would recommend DH to .. just about anyone over 18. It's not Michael Bay enough for kids, but it will do for couples and dudes. Very cool, strong film that knows what it wants to do (and i'm 99% sure those 3 crap scenes were forced in by some idiot producer).My vote: 8/10"
