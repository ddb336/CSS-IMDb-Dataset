" A day in a taxi
",0.0,0.404,2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Ingenious way of getting around the ban.
He won't be making any income from this but it does offer a glimpse into life, if may call it that, in Iran.
The little girl is really whiney for my liking.
This truly is the decline of Iran."
" Beautiful piece of work
",0.5994,-0.8802,2020-12-10 00:00:00,8,"There's my theory that the woman that puted the flower in dash was maybe working with the government and that flower was a sign to show which taxi has the camera so the thieves can steal the cam (and that woman knew where they were going)
And just like what was shown in that movie you can't tell who's good or bad just by their faces..."
" My most favourite section of the movie
",0.0,0.8109,2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"My most favourite parts of the movie are the ones questioning the protocols of the Islamic rulers of Iran for making movies. There is a character who will be judged as a good person from most viewers but according to these protocols, he should be a bad character. The movie perfectly shows the crack between the ideology ruling Iran and the real society. Interestingly, later Panahi becomes more philosophically advanced and asks do we have intrinsically good and bad people?"
" Showing the problems isn't enough to make a good movie
",0.0516,-0.5023,2020-04-19 00:00:00,4,"As an Iranian, I confirm the situation about the government of my country (actually it's far worse than described in this movie).
But unfortunately, that's not enough to make this movie a good one because there is no creativity to picture these problems."
" A humble tale, a must watch!
",0.0,0.5264,2020-03-08 00:00:00,9,"While the pieces ingrain in me, I can't stop thinking about the irony of this unveiled privilege. I have a voice and struggle to find the means to use it. Jafar faces prison, conveys in hunger strikes and is ultimately banned from using his craft to do what he does best/what he loves: storytelling. Yet - it doesn't stop him. It feeds him. The message is greater and like a rite, it passes (it's delivered).Maybe in this side of the world, we are too self-indulgent (imprisoned by this ubiquitous freedom we're so often unaware of).Perhaps, if we were to be constrained, if the message - and by message I mean story - was greater than us, if it defied every single pore of our body, if it defied our abstract prisons of ego and commiseration...perhaps then, only then, it could be told.For Jafar, Storytelling is a battlefield.One he urges to revisit, to save us from ignorance and obscurity. To tell us the story that we can't tell ourselves: our own. Either by censorship or fear. A humble tale, a must watch."
" Meet some people from Tehran
",0.0,0.0058,2019-12-07 00:00:00,7,I loved this movie whether the riders were real or actors. To be able to get a glimpse of Iran and its people is priceless. Hanna is the most adorable little smartass girl you could ever meet. Its sad to think it takes harsh goverment sanctions and making inocent civilians suffer to affect a much needed change in government since the 70's revolution. Love to the Iranian people.
" Hail Panahi.
",0.0772,0.9865,2019-11-19 00:00:00,7,"'Taxi Tehran (2015)' is an interesting experiment that pushes the boundaries of gorilla filmmaking. Its very existence is an act of rebellion, pushing back against the over-controlling Iranian government. It proves that there really is no excuse not to make a movie, or to complain about a 'small' budget. If you want it badly enough, if every fibre of your being urges to create, you should do it no matter the cost. This is the message that outlaw director Panahi imparts in this meta, social-realist drama that takes place entirely inside of a taxi. The vehicle is being by driven Panahi himself, playing a director who decides to make a covert picture by filming the occupants of his cab. In reality, the people he picks up are amateur actors. The flick still blends fact with fiction, though, and feels incredibly 'real' throughout. It's filled with charming, intelligent characters who each convey a different aspect of everyday Iran. This demystification is great; it shows that people are people no matter where you go. The piece doesn't shy away from criticising the very systems that force it to exist, though. It subtly jabs at governmental censorship and oppression, peeling back the confusion surrounding such a shadowy subject. The affair's 'on-the-streets' vibe is priceless, contributing the most to its strangely touching effect. It puts a smile on your face more than once but it's also rather sad. It's wonderfully conceived for such a stripped-back thing and it really flies by, to the point that you aren't really ready for it to end. It feels like a documentary; when you remind yourself that it isn't, it's rather bizarre. It's surprisingly good, even if it isn't exciting or suspenseful or, even, overly compelling. That's because it's engaging and intriguing, truly unlike anything I've seen before. It's actually pretty enjoyable and is probably the best version of itself possible. 7/10"
" Hit the FFWD towards the end
",0.0,0.9866,2019-10-23 00:00:00,3,"Interesting and fairly clever idea but to be perfectly blunt unless you have an interest in modern day Iran then this is pretty pointless. It started off with a few interesting, slightly comical ""passengers"" but once they've been dropped off it then becomes deeper and subsequently boring.
I like passing time when I'm bored by exploring different places around the world by using Google Maps and to an extent this is similar, so that aspect for me was semi interesting. I have also now learnt that French cars, in particular Peugeot, are popular in Tehran, and that using a hand held mobile 'phone whilst driving is legal."
" Wow...unique film about a unique country by a unique film maker
",0.0,0.8116,2019-10-21 00:00:00,9,"I just caught and recorded this film on BBC this weekend....it was brilliant.
I wish more fimm makers thought about making films in different ways.
The effect is watchable and extremely revealing.
In 2010 the Director was imprisoned and forbidden from making any future films by the Iranian government,This film is his response, allegedly working as a taxi driver, a series fo passenger pick up discuss whatever is otheir mind. Including those whoi think the religious repression in Iran does not help justice, and his own neice who explains what the Iranian code for film making is.... namely films must be real but not too sordid.So first what a fantastic way to show in sequence life in Tehran. not much different to life in UK or US but a knowing amount of censorship and prohibition evident on all their lives, from the supsrstition of two old ladies which is quite poetic until you realise they actually believe ti to the agreswsion of at least one passenger who thinks everyone should be hung...I have never beent o Tehran or iran but I want to got here now to talk to Iranians rather than let the demonisation of their people by Western media which is clearly intetn on bombing Iran ...not for human right abuses but for nuclear transgression which the US is driving.... anything to do with oil I wonder?
Please watch this film if you are geo-politically intersted or if you want to see new ways of story telling.Final point: As a leftie I know that many will think opinions of what the US does in its foreign policy are irrelevant...they're not...likewise the actions of the Iranian regime are also barbaric... the problem with modern life is we do not want to live under a tolatarian regime as we think our individualism is sacrosanct (its not), neither do we want to live under the materialistim of the capitalist west which enslaves us.... so make a choice leftie (they say), enjoy your freedom and your apple iphone and beware of China and Russia and Iran.....but we don't really want any of them eat or west....we aren't free so we can never take back control...cause we never had it anyway."
" Less than decent
",0.0,-0.8209,2019-07-15 00:00:00,4,"I didn't know past of the director or what he came across by making movies. I only found the title interesting and wanted to watch. For my experience it was worse than a decent film. Director was up on a pedestal and it made every scene less interesting and numb. Problems which he tried to explain were obvious and straight but at the end there was no scene that made me wonder what it will happen next. And the general ambiance of the film was too fake to be real and too real to be fake. So for me it was an ugly form of art. If that is what he wanted to create, great job."
" Fascinating
",0.5423,0.9948,2018-09-21 00:00:00,8,"Panahi directs himself as a taxi driver in the streets of Tehran picking up a variety of passengers each of whom has a fascinating story to tell.Worth noting: in 2010, Panahi was forbidden by the Iranian government to make movies for the next twenty years. Getting around this ban adds edge to the movie though it doesn't need it. Its uniqueness, charm, warmth, humour, and boldness all stand out very well on their own.While the viewer sees a lot of the street life, the camera is always placed within the taxi - a bold move especially for the final scene. The greatest delight is the variety of characters who inhabit the titular vehicle.The first scene involves two strangers, travelling in the same direction, having a blunt argument about their nation's capital punishment law. From here, the film's courage and frankness had me hooked. Another scene was frank about how Iranian women could face great difficulty in inheriting their husbands' estates.There is also great comic relief in two other scenes. One involves a seller of illegal foreign DVDs who is also a gushing fan of the director. When he's caught telling a name-dropping fib, he's hilarious. The other involves two middle-aged women whose ""life and death"" dilemma involves delivering goldfish to a particular location on time. One hopes to see this comedy duo in future films.Panahi's predicament is told via two other passengers. One is a pleasant woman who tried to help him legally during his prosecution but was ""brought down"" with him. The other, a major character, is his pre-teenage niece (Hana Saeidi) who talks of the short-film project she must make for school. Her descriptions of the film-making content rules add a further edge as they are the same ones Panahi had broken, thus putting him in his current situation.The performances vary but are mostly quite good including those of the characters mentioned above. Their names cannot be mentioned as no casting credits were allowed for this ""unofficial"" movie. Panahi himself is delightfully laid back, making the best of his life situation. Saeidi's performance is a bit mixed. She has the right precociousness for someone her age but her monologues are often loud, fast, and in a monotone. This is grating at times.""Taxi"" is not only an inspirational film; the story behind it proves that no matter how much a regime might wrongly repress its citizens, true art and talent will always find its way to those who appreciate it. It joins a list of other great Iranian films of the past two decades: ""A Separation"" (2011) - a masterpiece; ""The Past"" (2013) - a co-production with France; ""The Colour of Paradise"" (1999); ""The Circle"" (2000) - also by Panahi; and ""A Moment of Innocence"" (1996)."
" Director playing a director playing a cabby?
",0.3818,0.9042,2018-01-02 00:00:00,1,"This film would probably have made more sense if the director had been playing a director (sic) playing a cabby (sic) who is clandestinely playing a director (sic) who is not-so-covertly filming it all while miraculously avoiding hitting other vehicles and/or pedestrians. (If you're going to get ""meta"", get well and truly ""meta"".)I'd expected a genuine documentary -- though I did wonder how people's identities would be protected if they said anything incriminating. Of course, the statement that the director ""is joined by a host of spirited characters"" -- with the emphasis on ""characters"", should really have given the game away.So, all in all, a pretty pointless film that adds nothing to my understanding of the repressive Iranian regime and also fails to entertain. I regret having agreed to play a punter watching this film at home on BBC iPlayer; back to ""Extras"" for me."
" A slice of life in Teheran
",0.0,0.7082,2017-06-28 00:00:00,8,"A totally delightful, witty and understated account on contemporary life in Iran. The director playing himself driving a taxi, to earn extra cash because his movies are frowned upon by the State, has seemingly casual encounters with various passengers. The documentary style filming is all done from a camera mounted inside the cab. The encounters range from various strangers representing different views on politics, art and life, women's necessary wiliness in a repressed society, of social and religious prejudices. One passenger recognizes Jafar as the film-director (!) and tries to get him involved with his black-market dealings in foreign and suppressed local films. Implications about Sharia law are being deconstructed when a friend refuses to inform the police after having been robbed because he cannot bear the idea of the thief being dismembered or even hung for his deed. An interesting role is played by his young niece whom he has to pick up from school. Her assignment is to make a movie with her own small camcorder, following the rules and guidelines imposed by her teacher and the State. This ploy allows him to indirectly expose bureaucratic and political absurdities about film-making itself and the stifling rules on daily life."
