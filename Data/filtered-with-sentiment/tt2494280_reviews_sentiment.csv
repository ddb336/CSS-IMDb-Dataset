",0.0,0.3612,2021-02-26 00:00:00,9,"Chris Pin acting was astonishing. Very unique and unpredictable movie. It deserves 7,5 score at least here. I saw it just couple of minutes on tv channel and immediately get attract to watch it all."
" Two words - Joe Carnahan
",0.0,0.9287,2020-12-10 00:00:00,9,"After watching Boss Level that I rated 10, I went to see his work and found this movie - Stretch in his portfolio, that I had seen before and loved every minute of it, that's when I realized that this dude is the real deal and he is here to stay in the movie industry folks, period. You need special skills and talents to put these stories together. Great job"
" A Romp, you will not be disappointed!

" Blah-blah-blah...
",0.0,-0.9133,2020-11-06 00:00:00,1,"This is one of those piss poor american movies where the movie start with a nobody whining about how inadequate he is in life and how much of a difference his is going to make. Boring!!!If you've got nothing better to do, than watching this, you are really stretching it at your wits end."
" Underrated masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9757,2020-09-29 00:00:00,9,"If you're a guy who loves a comedy with a bit of action, this is the right movie for you. If you like Guy Ritchie movies, you'll love this. It has it all, it has charisma, action, comedy, nonsense. This is the kind of movie that can pick you up after a hard day and send you to bed happy, it's best served with a glass of scotch whisky to be honest but so do all of these movies. If you're not drinking something while watching the gentlemen, or let's be cops, you're not doing right. Anyway, great movie, great fun. Don't watch it with your mom (someone left a bad review because he watched it with his mom and it was awkward... Duh)"
" missing actors name in the credits...
",-0.296,-0.3612,2020-09-19 00:00:00,7,"I must have been dreaming when arching the film, but I can swear I saw Chris Pine play the character of the mad Karoso,,,right or not ?"
" Fast and funny
",0.4404,0.9408,2020-09-08 00:00:00,8,"A good laugh. Everything goes wrong for this guy but for the right reasons.
There are a few plot holes and some loose ends but they didn't spoil it for me.
Some drugs and strong profanity.
One of those films that you think could have been excellent, instead of just good, if they had just tidied it up a little.
Plenty of insane action and laughs."
" I'm so damn glad it had to finish
",0.0735,0.2609,2020-09-08 00:00:00,3,"I tried my best, I got 20 minutes to the end but sadly the ending didn't come soon enough so I made up my own ending and it was all just a bad nightmare....if you are stuck for a movie tonight, don't watch this.....watch Kill Me Three Times, now that is what I call a far more enjoyable movie."
" A Crazy Night
",-0.34,-0.228,2020-08-18 00:00:00,7,Patrick Wilson carries the show and does it well. A really fun movie with lots of action just no killing.
" Why?
",0.0,-0.2333,2020-03-31 00:00:00,1,"Why is it that nowadays every movie or series has to be more over the top, more shocking and more unrealistic?"
" Much better than expected ( B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",0.4404,0.9458,2020-02-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie is hilarious! Lots of fun! Action, comedy, some romance, fun storyline, it's got everything!"
" Terrible from start to finish...
",-0.4767,0.7348,2019-03-13 00:00:00,3,"Patrick Wilson was totally wrong in this role. I spent most of the movie just scratching my head, wondering WHY for so many reasons but the main one being, who believed in the storyline enough to give it the green light? Truly one of those times when you'd like those 90 minutes of your life back!"
" Ehh Okay
",0.2263,0.8189,2019-01-24 00:00:00,6,"I thought the main actor in this movie did not do well. He, or his character, were just boring ordinary people. His face does not fit well with someone trying to make his round in LA and fit the LA-guy lifestyle. He's terrific in many of his other movies, but not this one.I found myself easily getting bored, but I had to stay watching until the end. Pine does an excellent job as the LA-guy living that lifestyle. But the situations are all drawn out and no one cares at the end of the dayStill worth a watch6 stars"
" Nuckin' Futz
",0.0,-0.128,2019-01-21 00:00:00,6,"What I can only imagine to be the result of a cocaine-fueled fever dream, this movie starts out at nuckin' futz and only gets crazier; outlandish, unhinged, & chock full of shameless, scene-devouring performances."
" Entertaining but not Superlative Comedic Action Thriller
",-0.0867,0.8931,2019-01-15 00:00:00,7,"15 November 2014. This entertaining wry comedy thriller has plenty of action and mishmash of good and bad guys chasing after Patrick Wilson's character who still obsesses over his ex-girlfriend while finding himself as a limo driver who ends up with a billionaire with strange tastes played by Chris Pine of the rebooted Star Trek fame. The storyline holds together pretty well though some of the logical points are a bit bent out of shape. Apparently this is a movie after all, right? One can find some elements of the comedy spy action movie Red (2010) played by an aging ensemble of A-listed stars, Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop (1984), and John Cusack in War, Inc (2008).Stretch beings a masochistic and weird tone into the mainstream as Patrick Wilson's weaves his away around many threats to his life with at times a witty voice over and periodic fateful occurrences. Somehow, the eventual outcome of this movie doesn't quite add up to more than the sum of its parts and offers up a entertaining but nevertheless not quite as substantive and deep a movie as well as completely satisfying a movie as it could have been."
" IF you REALLY love movies...you HAVE to love this one!
",0.9143,0.9953,2018-11-03 00:00:00,10,"This film is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen, its is in my top 10 all time favs. Funny, Funny Funny! I live in LA so I can relate to the hollywood drama lifestyle madness. Its true, I have seen some of it. the wild parties...true. the drug crazy club girls....true the brothers as the bouncers at ALL the clubs in la....TRUE. The hilarious wanna be rappers full of bs....TRUE!
the mexicans as the collectors for bad debts.....wait for it.....TRUE!!I laughed from start to finish. ray lioota as an ahole but just keeping it real ahole...true. the bit where stretch picks him up and ""tries"" to act sincere. IS NOT TO BE MISSED, it so well written! there are more bits throughout the entire film, that are just perfectly written. if you dont live here you most likely wont get the jokes, but I do and I did! the entire sequence with Karl
"" with a K "" doing his ultimate limo thing, IS CLASSIC! if you are going to watch this, watch the guy in the back of the limo, when karl ?????. what he does is funny! GREAT MOVIE!! THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PATRICK AND ALBA IS SWEET, FUNNY AND IT GOT TO ME! THE LAST 5 MIN? PERFECT ENDING! NUF SAID!"
" Crazy
",-0.34,0.6908,2018-05-27 00:00:00,8,I love the crazy unexpected events of the movie. A heck of a lot better than the trailer let's on.
" A Fun Ride...Wild...Wacky...and Irreverent Black Comedy
",0.7003,-0.9296,2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"Life isn't Fair. This Post-Modern, Self-Aware, Irreverent, sometimes Crude and Lewd Black Comedy is Wheelhouse for Writer-Director Joe Carnahan.Life isn't Fair ...for the Movie's Protagonist ""Stretch"" a Limo-Driver Loser that through some ""Fateful"" Events has a Chance to ""Man-Up"" and take Control of His Life that Spins out of Control on a Regular Basis.He barely makes a Living Chauffeuring Hollywood Types and Fat Cats as They make Whoopee with Their ""Ill Gotten Gains"" and are Cruel Carnivores. He's Broke and Heavily in Debt to the Mob and the ""Love of His Life"" Leaves Him for a NFL Quarterback who makes Millions. Life isn't Fair.This is a Raucous Ride that brings out Adjectives like...Fun...Wild...Wacky...Those sort of Reactions. It's one of those that is Not for Everyone.But it is a Smart, Rapidly Paced Picture that, if You Don't Mind Foul Language, Unsettling Satirical Set-Pieces about Indulgences like Drug Abuse, Sex, and Manipulative Ugly ""Alpha"" Types, there is much Enjoyment to be had in this Type of Thing.A Good Cast Rides the Cutting Edge for All its Worth. It goes Over the Top at times but that's the Template, so Enjoy. Patrick Wilson seems Effortless in Bringing to Life a Likable Loser that is Game when the Chips are Down and All seems Lost.The Movie, for some Inexplicable Reason was Released Straight to Video and Ignored and Abandoned by the Suits. Considering the Deluge of Dreck that is in Theaters on a Regular Basis it is really a Shame that this one got the Shaft. Life isn't Fair."
