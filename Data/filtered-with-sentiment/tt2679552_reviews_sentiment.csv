" Quite enjoyable if you can look past the silliness
",0.3167,0.9257,2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"Okay going to keep it short and sweet, no need for a detailed critique on this one. Firstly, as people will surely say, this has been done before, nothing new. That's not necessarily a bad thing though, sometimes you want to know what you're getting and you can still enjoy a movie that's formulaic. Where it is let down is the writing is poor and some of the situations completely absurd. Despite that there were some tense moments, which is the goal of any decent thriller. This film is not a world-beater and it's not one you'll see more than once, but if you're in a forgiving mood and want an easy watch, it's a solid 6 out of 10."

By the numbers commercial project, everything you'd expect and absolutely nothing more. Not a original filmic idea, with all actors playing their cliche' roles professionally, adequately, and without any distinction whatsoever: Pierce Brosnan the beleaguered patriarch, he and his standard issue wife and daughter victimized by a psychotic tech genius.Brosnan may no longer officially be James Bond, but he gets to play an amateur spy, which had me involuntarily flashing back on that role we've seen him do so much. Aand he gets to drive a fancy car, too. Wonder, was that in his contract?If you're choosing between time-wasters, this is as mediocre as any"

" Shallow.
",0.0,0.4041,2020-12-14 00:00:00,2,I cannot believe I actually watched this. The antagonist had no real motive for his actions. A classic tale of invite stranger to hour house to be kind and stranger is psycho. Nothing new here. And Kaitlyn didnt have enough friends? To the point that she sees some guy and automatically starts talking to and inviting him to their house. The acting was not bad but definitely could have been better. Plot was full of holes. We never really know what drove Ed to do that. You can almost tell 15mins into the movie how it's going to end.
" My whole family loves this movie!
",0.6114,0.9673,2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"We all thought the plot was interesting and the acting was great! This movie starts out creepy and gets more intense. The ending is satisfying so don't listen to the few negative review on here, just watch it yourself and make up your own mind. Pierce Brosnan is an amazing actor - you know that's true or he wouldn't have been cast in all those James Bond films. This is an entertaining suspense movie! Check it out, you will be pleasantly surprised."

And as far as the technicalities are concerned, no you don't hack things like that and when you hack random displays do not act funny. This movie is wrong on so many levels. A typical movies of a mentally ill or an ""unprivileged"" person trying to be the hero....
Anyways it's not super bad either so 4 stars for this one."

" How not to run the IT arm of a big high-tech firm
",0.0,0.983,2019-08-11 00:00:00,4,"""I.T."" is in the genre of modern fast-action mystery thrillers. It's a dark film that centers around electronic technology. Unfortunately, the script isn't very good. None of the acting is remarkable. The biggest name is Pierce Brosnan who plays Mike Regan. But his role seems overdone at times, and not believable at other times. This guy is living with real tension for his business, and he pretends as though there's no pressure on him when he's home.I listed my comments as having possible spoilers because I had to make some observations about the ease with which the weird character was able to wreak such havoc. Considering that the year is 2016, it's amazing that a jet airline travel service, with all its reliance on high tech, would not have better vetted applicants for high-tech jobs in the company. Then, Regan ""invites"" the IT guy whom he had never met or known before, to his home to fix his sophisticated equipment. Then he gives this perfect stranger his Wi-Fi password.One other point in the film that I think is glossed over, is daughter Kaitlyn Regan's accepting the stranger, Patrick (played by Jason Barry), as her Facebook friend. Later she blames her dad for the fiasco with the hacking, for bringing the IT guy into their home. But even though he had Regan's Wi-Fi password and had wired his house system for his use, he still needed to get into the network. I think the way he was able to do that was through Kaitlyn's smart phone, when she gave him access to her.The time of my writing this is summer of 2019, and I've just read an article about how easy it will be for hackers to get into private home networks through any of the new smart devices now being made and bought. Apparently, the automatic coffee makers, toasters, juicers, and other handy modern appliance that works with computer programs, are easy targets for hackers. They don't have the built-in security and constantly improving security of PCs, laptops and smart phones. But, because they are tied into those devices, they are the avenues for hackers to use to get into the mainframes of private computer systems and programs.This film borders a little on the horror genre. The best part of it is the suspense of not knowing what Patrick will do next. Otherwise, there isn't much in this film that is very good. But it might be used for training or education on how not too run the IT arm off a big high-tech firm."
" Where's the clown!?!
",0.0,-0.765,2019-04-20 00:00:00,1,"This film was mis-sold, there were no scary clowns in this film and no sign of any of Stephen King's writing.

However, the only thing close to a clown in the film is Pierce Brosnan for signing up to be in such muck..."
" Flying Into Trouble!
",-0.4574,-0.4445,2019-03-18 00:00:00,5,"Blend one part of an updated metropolitan Cape Fear with one part Demon Seed (70's A.I. Julie Christie thriller) and you may end up with a cinematic cocktail such as I.T. But even with executive producer Pierce Brosnan working up a sweat, it just ends up being one of those very uneven films, full of contrivances and red herrings, that you feel should have been better.I.T. whilst obviously not blessed with a huge budget, still looks good. The sets are realistic and the cinematography is more than adequate, as is the acting from the cast with Pierce still demonstrating he has what it takes to lead a picture of this nature.Most of the problems I have with the film lie with the script. It just keeps expecting us to accept scenarios which require more exposition or at worst, seem totally illogical.Take the family for instance. There doesn't seem to be much love around in one of those nuclear units who appear to have everything. Daughter Kaitlyn is your regulation 17 year old whiney brat. Wife Rose, played by a very underused Anna Friel, is just quite cold towards husband Mike from the outset. Is there a reason for this? I almost choked on my popcorn later in the movie, when the family is facing very clear and present dangers, and both mother and daughter just tell Mike to solve it himself and be quick about it. Whatever happened to family solidarity?I'd love to get a nerdish take on I.T. A guy comes to work on internet speeds in admittedly, ""a smart home"" and the next minute he's taken remote control of your sports car? Again, we don't get much background on cyber-villain and resident white, male creep, Ed Porter and what we get turns out to be fake any way. So where did he get all these freakish tech skills and resources? And why aren't the cops more suspicious of him later in the film if they are aware, he isn't who he says he is.Mike's a guy, who as mentioned earlier has it all. Why does he take so long to raise his issues with other ICT experts? We realise he has the money to bring Bill Gates in to review his security. Instead he finally gets around to getting some shadowy dude from some shady government department. It doesn't make a lot of sense, especially when ludicrously for no reason other than to ramp up the movie's suspense quota, he decides that he will break into Porter's apartment. What's with the camera installation, that then, never comes into the rest of the plot? And my aged mother-in-law would have been able to tell a very naive Mike, that taking the stolen usb's straight to the police, would obviously get him into trouble.Has there ever been a more stark and far reaching segue between the movie's final 2 dialogue free scenes (if my memory serves me correctly) ? A villain put down and Mike back on top of the flying world.I just hope Rose and Kaitlyn actually showed him some gratitude this time."

The acting is very well done, and the villain is great. occasionally the writing is a bit weird but for the most part it's great. The action scenes are thrilling to watch, very few cliches. The story is fantastic and plot is fantastic, scenes transition smoothly (speaking of transitions, they are astonishingly well done, and very immersive). Also has brilliant use of 'Chekhov's Gun'. The genre may be overdone, but like I said, this is the best of it.The only thing that really annoyed me was repeated use of similar shots (ie. eye level shots and orbiting shots)"

" Who thinks of ideas like this?
",0.3612,0.6421,2018-09-01 00:00:00,3,"Seriously, the driven business man, the demented IT genius, the rebellious daughter. So cliche. Still the idea, particularly in this day and age, could have had some nuanced subtlety as it unfolded, but I guess movie makers dont think audiences can handle clever so we get ham handed quickly moving into the ludicrous. Acting wasnt bad, but the plot could only satisfy the least ambitious people out there."
" Mostly just a retread of an old formula
",0.0,0.9665,2018-07-14 00:00:00,4,"Haven't we all seen this premise before? Namely, a stranger coming into the lives of a good person (or people), and at first is nice, but soon starts to show some really creepy attributes that eventually spill over into sociopathic actions. Well, actually, I wouldn't mind seeing this premise all over again had it been done with enough fresh new traits and imaginative execution. But ""I.T."" doesn't contain very much that's original. Although the movie has a high tech theme, even this has been done before in other movies. And don't get me started on the climax, which is so unimaginative and cliched instead of being more creative. The icing on the cake is a concluding sequence what will have you asking, ""Is that it?"", since it is so unsatisfying. To be fair, the movie is decently made with what couldn't have been a megabudget, and some of the performances are fine (though Pierce Brosnan's acting seems a big constipated at times). But for the most part, the movie doesn't offer enough variety from the hundreds of other times you've seen this same basic story before."
" My first instincts were right...
",0.0,0.7727,2018-07-09 00:00:00,2,"Right! My thoughts after an hour...Derivative, predictable drivel. Psycho gets control of a smart home, monitors family - gosh, that's original! - hacks into computer system, etc, etc, etc. The authorities don't believe it. Ring any bells? It should ring a whole campanile!But if you can stick it out for an hour, it actually, amazingly starts to get more interesting. Although still largely predictable, with the obvious 'hero' stupid moves, and with more script Uh Ohs than you really want.Any attempt at redemption after an hour eventually dissolves into a hackneyed, cliched story line. Poor writing.Having said that, if you like this sort of movie, it's as good - or as bad as any! But do yourself a favour and watch a Pierce Brosnan James Bond rerun! And because or Pierce, I just can't bring myself to give it 1*!But hey - I watch these things so you don't have to!"
" Good Premise, but Poor on the Execution
",-0.4939,0.9469,2018-07-09 00:00:00,6,"In this day and age of the internet taking over our lives, this movie seemed like a really good premise. Pierce Brosnan is Mike Regan, owner of a private aircraft firm that is going to try and start up a Uber-type business for private jets. He needs money and his company is going to go public with its stock as long as the SEC approves.When a presentation goes awry because of a computer glitch, a temp employee named Edward fixes the glitch. Mike warms to him and invites the man to his house to help him speed up his internet. Little does he know he has invited the fox into the hen house. When Edward starts to cross the line between employee and friend, Mike cuts him off, then fires him. Upset, Edward hacks Mike's house's security system and takes over control of it. He then starts making life for Mike and his family a living hell. Up to this point, the movie was pretty inventive and imaginative. Then it loses steam. The second half is just a series of overdone action tropes as Mike tries to get Edward out of his life. That was probably the most disappointing thing is how the first half was great and then I was let down. There was a recent episode of the X-Files reboot in which Scully and Mulder are under assault by the ""internet"" and it was done way better. Had I.T. not gotten lazy in the second half and addressed some real concerns about the invasion of privacy, rather than going for the cheap thrills, it would have been a much better movie. Still it is worth a watch.I was planning to turn my home into a smart home prior to seeing this movie. I think I will just stick to switching on the lights and thermostat myself."
" Predictable Thriller That Plays On Paranoia
",0.1027,-0.6577,2018-07-08 00:00:00,2,"This completely predictable ""thriller"" stars Pierce Brosnan as Mike Regan - the head of an airline which is about to go public, and James Frecheville as Ed Porter - an IT temp working at Mike's company who so impresses Mike that he brings him into his home to fix the wifi. Yup. That's how this all starts. While he's there, Ed develops a fixation with Mike's daughter Kaitlyn (Stefanie Scott) - which Mike and his wife Rose (Anna Friel) don't like - because Ed's like 11 years older than Kaitlyn and, well, he's a bit creepy. He tries to crash family events, he shows up unannounced where he shouldn't be. Eventually, Mike fires Ed and tells him to stay away. But Ed has hacked into the Regan's ""smart home"" system, so that he can see and hear everything going on and control all sorts of things from his apartment - which looks a bit like a starship bridge from Star Trek. Eventually, we find out that Ed is a lot creepy, as he takes his revenge against Mike for the way he feels he's been mistreated.Yes, it's very predictable. A lot of it doesn't make sense and doesn't seem particularly well thought out. When Mike hires a guy to ""fix"" the Ed problem, he talks to him on the phone while lying in his bed. Why doesn't Ed know about it? Doesn't he have the house wired? Shouldn't he have heard? And unless I missed something, Kaitlyn actually kind of liked Ed - so why did Ed target her? I could understand him going after Mike and Rose - but why Kaitlyn? There are a variety of other things that made little sense, but those are the two I remembered most.The movie leads up to one of the most unbelievable confrontations I've ever seen, and then the movie kind of ends with a whimper as all goes back to normal. To be perfectly blunt, this isn't really worth your time. The performances were uneven. There's a bit of a reflection on privacy in this, and it might succeed in making you a bit paranoid if you've gone big time into the whole ""smart house"" thing. (2/10)"
" Gaping plot holes and terrible job of making the work
",-0.4767,-0.8079,2018-04-20 00:00:00,3,"My first issue is with the fact that Regan didn't try to have Ed charged with possession and/or distribution of child pornography. 17 year old, video of them engaging in some kind of sexual act, and I'm assuming the movie just censored the fact that if this were real life he would have footage of the actual action. The fact that literally nobody in the movie even thought about child pornography as a way to stop this maniac just baffles me. Wooden acting, cringe-worthy story elements and directing decisions, not to mention absolutely terrible camera work at many points. I started this movie with hope but it just kept getting worse."
" I felt sorry for Pierce Brosnan
",-0.0772,-0.9081,2018-01-29 00:00:00,1,"The worst film ever. I don't understand why Pierce Brosnan agreed to act in this film? The plot is ""0"". Extremely stupide story (a millionare has got nobody in the worls to help him and he's fighting personally with a freak), bad acting, even worse direction, dialogs wrritten by amators. I was irritated at the end."
" A well-executed thriller
",0.1027,0.9572,2017-11-27 00:00:00,9,"I.T. is exactly what it aspires to be, and thank God for that! It's a properly executed contemporary thriller that keeps you on the edge of the seat. It consists of all the usual components: modern technology, fast paced action, solid acting, lovely women and good score. There's suspense, there's violence, it's beautifully shot and nicely edited. It also revolves around a major (conservative) theme of a family man who has to face danger in order to protect his beautiful family. Pierce Brosnan (whose Irish Dreamtime co-produced the film) stars in a role that one would rather expect for Harrison Ford (""Firewall"") or Mel Gibson (""Edge of Darkness""). A man in his early 60s Brosnan doesn't lose any of his boyish charm but at the same time he is surprisingly convincing as both, successful businessman and furious family man taking revenge. The climax of the film (NO SPOILER) may seem a bit overdone but again, it only confirms that it's a traditionally crafted thriller. In short: if you know what to expect (and you should know!), you will enjoy it."
" Get the temp guy
",0.0,0.9092,2017-09-27 00:00:00,6,"This is an electronic stalker film that degrades into the physical.

Ed Porter (James Frecheville) is the I.T. temp who saves Mike's electronic presentation. Ed helps Mike with his car and home computers and then becomes infatuated with Mike's 17 year old daughter (Stefanie Scott) which becomes a bit creepy leading to the formula script.For Pierce Bronson, this is a step down from ""Urge"" which was a step down from his other work. I hope the trend ends for Pierce, however it is nice to have someone of his caliber in a ""B"" home ""invasion"" genre. The DVD cover seems to promise some fancy high tech film when it is more closer to a David Hess film. Not the worst in class.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."

This was the typical Netflix n Chill type movie for the more masculine viewer (so not a rom com but a semi-drama semi-thriller). The reason why many are only rating it at 50% rather than the 70% I give it is because they are judging it against movies that actually intended to be 10/10s; this movie was not supposed to be masterfully plot-driven or to grip you at every stage it was supposed to be for you to watch on Netflix while chatting up your girlfriend or bantering with the guys about the nerdy villain or about how the daughter is a b**** and deserved what he did to her or alternatively white knight and say how much you want Mr. ex-James Bond to beat him to a pulp.This was 'by men for men' type of movie so of course the women are plain, what do you think men feel when we watch Rom Coms? All the men are pathetically shallow in them, here the women are because this is for men!Get over yourself with the need for every movie to be perfect. Do you want that the villain isn't partially autistic and psychotic on top of that? Do you want a boring characterisation but amazing storyline? Go read a damn book if you can't appreciate the brilliant acting by that villain! It was a damn good watch and oh my god the antihero hacker was PERFECTION. From the accent to his body language, he was everything that a white-hat hacker is and many less malignant coders will adore how he uses his talents and knowledge to defend the innocent against abuse from black-hat hackers.If you are into coding, this movie is in fact one of the pinnacles of what the difference is between a good and an evil hacker and proves that being sneaky and intelligent does not mean you need to abuse those weaker than you but that you can still fight for a greater good and earn money doing it."
" Void Of Common Sense (Spoilers.... duh)

Because of the lack of any police use. Nobody called the police when he kept turning up to family events. The police didn't catch him doing any of the hacking stuff.He doesn't call in IT people to fix his house or phone.Just the lack of common sense from the protagonist annoyed me despite the rest of the film being half decent."
" Housework chores rather than this film!
",0.0,-0.8444,2017-09-13 00:00:00,4,"I noted that this movie had a very good rating on Netflix, and having nothing better to do on a week day evening I decided to watch it.As to the plot: well, young IT wizard (Jason Berry) helps out a corporation boss (Pierce Brosnan) . Boss subsequently befriends and employs IT wizard, who then takes an unhealthy interest in Boss's daughter. Boss gets wise to this and sacks IT wizard. IT wizard sets out on exacting a cyber revenge, which ends all rather explosively. Nuff said!The problem with this movie is that it expects too much of itself; it doesn't know whether it wants to be plot driven or character driven. In the end, it settles for a poor compromise. The plot is highly derivative and features in so many previous movies. In fact, if they had spent a little more time unraveling the psychology of the villain (Jason Berry), which was a missed opportunity, they would have had a better plot line.In terms of the characters, I can't image that Pierce Brosnan, Anna Freil, and Jason Berry, have had less demanding roles. I was left having no sympathy for any of the characters, whether they be villains or victims. I came to the conclusion that I was the victim or a rating hoax. After an hour, I was willing the film on to a speedy conclusion. Ten minutes before the end I decided to do the washing up and watch the remainder over my shoulder.The movie lacks plot development, character development, but above all else it lacks 'watchability'."
" The moral fiber is the only thing good here.
",0.4404,0.9062,2017-09-01 00:00:00,3,"I had high hopes for this movie. Alright, not high but decent! Pierce Brosnan rarely give a poor performance and James Frecheville had just the right amount of crazy in his character, so the layup was alright.Although there is nothing in this film I can view as a ""oh that was a first""-moment or a truly climactic moment when it all just comes together. Every part of it, EVERY part of it feel like it's taken from the ""Moviemaking for dummies""-manual. Even Brosnans accent was all over the place, for the first 20 min I didn't get why the Irishman was playing a Canadian without background about it.Everything from the job story to the kid and the ""old man wanting to go back to a simpler time"" was just bad. Don't see the movie, if you've seen other movies you've seen this one without wasting 90 minutes of your life.The main reason I didn't turn it off to see something else was the stubborn hope that it would come some sort of twist at the end. But I guess the twist was that it ended just as you'd expect after seeing the first 10 min.Michael Nyqvist does play his part really well and the moral fiber concerning the problems you face if you put all of your life online makes this a 3 star rating for me."
" Netflix original pattern patent
",0.3182,0.942,2017-08-26 00:00:00,3,"There seems to be a pattern with Netflix original's which can be delineated as follows. 1. A reasonably interesting premise. 2. The opening half an hour where the premise is established. 3 The rest of the film which turns out to be a bit rubbish, causing one to enquire, is this what most film's would be like without the likes of Spielberg, Cameron, or any director for that matter who would take a reasonable idea and makes it interesting, different or subtle. This Netflix original follows such a pattern. Despite some early pertinent implications regarding the use of modern technology it quickly sheds the potential to be fresh or distinctive instead wrapping itself in the generic thriller blanket and becoming a one dimensional pantomime far too easily. Character exploration is flushed in favour of a predictable prosaic snore fest."

Nothing is ever (Clear) in real life. There are always little mistakes that could... Well, you should watch this film. Good Work!!!"
" I.T. stands for ""It's Terrible""
",-0.4767,0.9808,2017-08-06 00:00:00,1,"Based on the plot, I expected this to be a fairly good thriller. I was not ready for the level of disappointment it delivered.The first suspension of disbelief was the voice-over in the first few minutes describing Brosnan's character (an aviation company owner) as 52. Come on, it's Pierce Brosnan! He was 63 when this was released, he looked late fifties in the movie. They should have made him 57-59.Honest, I heard the voice-over and I choked with laughter.But it simply got worse.Brosnan is Irish by birth. His bizarre accent was dreadful. I think he was trying to do a Northern Ireland accent - that part of the United Kingdom north of the border with the Republic of Ireland, but it was a real ham of a performance.Then follows a creepy story ticking all of the boxes for a predictable, by-the-numbers, talented I.T. guy stalker movie.I took issue with the idea that someone in charge of a multi-million dollar aviation corporation could be so careless as to give out his home wireless password so easily and not change it to something else to secure it.When the smart house system acts up, no thinks to pull the cable to the internet router.Why is the I.T. guy using an AC voltage detector to check CAT5 cables? Who was the technical support person employed on this movie? Fire them.The I.T. guy mentions features of the control system and Brosnan tells him they have been disabled for privacy. Hmm, I.T. guy has your home wireless password and knows the smart home has cameras in the control panels. No chance of some mischief then...There's a completely gratuitous scene of the daughter taking a shower. To be honest, they could have cut this entire subplot and it would not have been missed.Even Anna Firel, playing the wife, could have had all of her scenes deleted and it would have made no difference. What was the point of her character? I hope she was paid well.By the time the retribution angle arrived, I had lost all interest and simply sat on to see what else might turn up. All the expected twists turned up including a night time tropical storm which was presumably included to 'heighten tension' during the last scenes. For the rest of the movie, the weather during the day was calm and the nights were without incident. This sudden tempest was another unnecessary addition.Best watched with a group of friends who want a good comedy - a thriller it is not."
" A good hero, a bad guy who isn't convincing, and some cool high tech tricks
",0.3699,0.9316,2017-07-11 00:00:00,6,"I.T. (2016)A typical modern thriller with a strong (and typical) performance by Pierce Brosnan as a wealthy businessman. He's painted as a good guy, with a loving wife and slightly rebellious but nice enough teenage daughter.They live in a modern rich house with the latest in ""smart"" appliances, so the shower and the windows and video cameras are all controlled through computers, which are connected by internet. Enter the I.T. expert who is asked (without any background check at all) to enter this guy's house and tinker with the system which is wonky. And to ogle the daughter, who he begins to admire, and then stalk. It gets ugly from there. If only the actor playing the villain were half as evil as he wishes he was--he's a big flaw in all the suspense.Lots of predictable buttons are pushedâthe angry father, the demonic mind of the criminal, and the many screens and portable devices that can show pictures in fancy ways. It's all pretty good stuff, but never quite as inventive or scary or even as visually chilling as it could have been. One flaw, for example, is the key soft porn scene that was supposedly captured by a tablet on a table, and yet it is shows like normal cinematography with a variety of camera shots and perfect clarity, etc. There are lots of little opportunities lost here, but Brosnan is a decent version of the angry father out for justice. Not as sensational as the Liam Neesan type in recent movies, and more believable. With some computer spying tricks that keep it all interesting along the way."
" By the ... binary code
",0.0,-0.9035,2017-06-12 00:00:00,4,"Sometimes you have to wonder why some thrillers are being made the exact same way over and over again. Yes this has the added ""Big Brother"" (who's a crazy person and not related by blood) theme going, but other than that, the clichÃ©s are running wild. And not necessarily in a good way. There are strings to this and confused feelings that could have been explored (private taping) more deeply - no pun intended.But the movie opts for the easy, ""suspensful"" way out. The warning signs are there early and while Pierce Brosnan himself is always able to come off as likable, his character seems to be very oblivious to say the least. It could have been way easier and logic alone would have prevented most of what transpires ... but then again, we wouldn't have this movie ... wait that wouldn't have been that bad now ..."
" When your IT guy uses his expertise against you
",0.0,-0.9919,2017-06-07 00:00:00,5,"Pierce Brosnan stars in ""I.T."" from 2016. It's hard to express just how pathetic this movie is. Pierce Brosnan decided not to have a facelift, and I admire him for it. But he looks tired, and his days of doing roles where he gets into physical fights should be over.Brosnan plays Mike Regan, a wealthy man who runs a company. After a computer expert named Ed (Jason Frecheville) gets them out of technical trouble, Regan hires him.However, when Ed starts sniffing around Regan's daughter, he's fired. His revenge is to turn the house against its occupants. So sloppy. The parents don't like him because a) he's creepy and b) he's older than their daughter. And there's Anna Friel as Regan's wife, 20 years younger than Brosnan.When Ed shows up at a family gathering, Regan is so rude to him it's ridiculous. Offensive scene. Later on, the two have an altercation and Regan is arrested. Right, the cops always do that, arrest an incredibly wealthy man on the word of some kid - and then gives Ed his gun back in case he wants to kill someone later. When Regan talks on the phone, Ed doesn't hear the call. It seems that everything in the house is monitored - but not the phone. The acting was okay, with Brosnan really laying on the Irish brogue. Standouts for me were Frecheville and the guy who works on the house to help Regan out of his predicament.Bad ending too."

" Bizarre movie -- which might make it worth watching
",-0.1027,0.9878,2017-04-05 00:00:00,6,"This is a bizarre movie -- for reasons few will notice. It's a thriller about a wealthy man who founded and is CEO of a big private jet manufacturing company. Quite rich, Brosnan gets entangled with a deranged computer hacker working as an I.T. temp in his company. It's perhaps a mediocre movie, but I was transfixed by the tale.You see, this wealthy CEO -- seeking to make much more money by taking the company public -- was the GOOD GUY. His employees really liked him, and they had a great working relationship.I can't recall the last movie I watched where a profit-seeking wealthy person was the hero. I kept expecting his fatal capitalist flaw to appear -- uncontrollable greed, yada, yada, yada. It didn't happen.(Yeah, Bruce Wayne was wealthy, but never do you hear him discussing making more money. Just giving his daddy's money away, making more Batman toys -- and living large.)I'm not necessarily recommending the movie to you, but perhaps it's worth seeing JUST for this ""man bites dog"" reason. It's a reminder that it's not ABSOLUTELY necessary for movie makers to always portray rich people as villains.One thing's for sure -- it won't start a trend in movies. Not a chance."
" did the one sheet miss two letters from the title?...

That is, until the relationship with his I.T. adviser turns nasty. after arriving to the house unannounced, and abruptly told to leave by Mike, this leads to a change in personality of the adviser, so much to the point where his teenage daughter is being stalked and his family is under attack through every technological factor of their lives.it's like being back in 1993 again....I could watch Pierce Brosnan do anything, if there was a Blu Ray release of Pierce reading the dictionary.....A, I would buy it and it's 25 sequels.I knew I wasn't going to get the best cinematic experience, this coming from the man who single handed destroyed the Die Hard franchise, but what drew me to the film was of course Brosnan, but the fact that it harks back to those 'nice people turn psycho' films that were rife in the early nineties, thanks to Fatal Attraction, and the majority of Michael Douglas' output from 1987-1996.This has more in common with 1996's Fear, where Marky Mark got really funky with Reese Witherspoon.It's nothing new, Brosnan is married to Anna Friel, he has the perfect life, a wonderful daughter, and a new guy in the company who seems too good to be true.And like The Cable Guy, Mike says something that instantly makes our antagonist think they are best friends, and when he is rejected, that's when the obligatory stalking, and voyeurism begins.So for the final third, it's Brosnan on a mission to save his family, and it's all over before you can say 'there's an Unlawful Entry in Pacific Heights, by a Single White female'.It's completely stuck in the nineties, but I've always has a weakness for these types of thrillers, and it filled a guilty pleasure of a gap,"
" Good Suspense and Tension

Porter makes moves on Mike's daughter Kaitlyn (Stefani Scott) and he lets Porter know this is not acceptable. Porter wires Mike's house and his business. Porter is now in control of Mike's house and Mike has no recourse as he cannot prove anything. Porter also did something to insure Mike would not get the IPO he needs to raise money for his new business venture. We see many scenes with Porter spying on Mike's house and we see the family terrified at all the happenings that Porter is able to set in motion. He also captures Kaitlyn masturbating in the shower and those scenes are distributed among Kaitlyn's classmates. We don't really see anything here, but we know what is going on. Mike hires Henrik (Michael Nyqvist) to undo everything Porter did in the house. Does this solve the problem? Not really. It is decided that Mike needs to get all the flashdrives that show all Porter's programs for what he did spying on the house. Does this solve the problem? Not Really. The police get him for breaking and entering. See? No help. He just cannot win. What to do? What do do?The vehicle scenes when Porter controls Mike's speeding car are outstanding. There is good suspense and tension throughout. The fight scenes are very good (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes. Rating: B."
" VIEWS ON FILM review of I.T.
",0.0,-0.9693,2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"I've seen Unlawful Entry. I've seen 1996's Fear. I.T. (my latest review) feels similar and in terms of being a guilty pleasure, I sort of liked it. Pierce Brosnan plays the protagonist for a change. He grits his teeth and rages. Based on his recent run of glitzy projects, Brosnan senses the need to be executive producer here as well. In other casting news, James Frecheville portrays I.T.'s twenty-something antagonist. He's real nasty and out of control. Now I.T. doesn't have an MPAA rating but I'll saddle it with a formidable R. It's shoddily violent with a few F words and a masturbation scene. As far as Internet releases go, this ode to gloss, sheen, and deadly hard drives, is formidably above the Mendoza line.Anyway, I.T. gets the reward for being the slickest, most techy thriller I've viewed in many a moon. It's about an aviation tycoon developing an Uber-like app, an app made to get people in a plane to fly cross country. In regards to I.T.'s look, well it's so sterile and pristine, you could literally lick the surface off of any screen it's playing on.Slickness and high-tech proficiency aside, I.T. doesn't feel like present day. It appears as if it takes place in the future (maybe twenty years ahead). The moral of its story is that you should never mess with a computer genius who works for you and wants to take out your underage daughter. He might be a sociopath, a hacker, or a lonely screw head. And if you rub him the wrong way, he may be bent on ruining your life.With I.T., there are sleek automobiles, a reincarnation of the song ""Words"" by Missing Persons, an environment mostly populated by the upper class, and Pierce using an Irish accent this time around. It makes sense. This dude is in fact, Irish. Also, I.T. contains a Baltimore, Md setting, co-stars that resemble notables (Brosnan's daughter and wife characters look like a young Ginnifer Goodwin and Annette Bening respectively), and a director who gets a bounce back period from dreck like A Good Day to Die Hard and Max Payne (that would be Ireland's own John Moore).All in all, I.T. is far from epic. It produces an ending that is rote and variably abrupt. However, this flick is willful and tightly edited in a way that could satisfy any audience member looking for a rental time killer. My rating: 3 stars."
" Bland waste of schlock potential
",-0.4215,-0.9913,2017-02-19 00:00:00,3,"The trailer for this film looked like it could be a fun, goofy schlock film about Pierce Brosnan and his family trapped in a ""Smart House"" run by a psychotic, disgruntled ex-employee of Brosnan's. Unfortunately the script is far more convoluted and meandering. Positives: Some of the shots were rather nicely composed. I give particular praise to one shot that dollies from one room into another, yet halfway through the shot it seamlessly transforms into a dutch angle. The colour palette during the night scenes were reminiscent of a Fincher rip off (this is a complement), but the scenes during the day looked monotonous and dull. I always have thought Brosnan is a likable leading man, and in this film you do sympathise with him. Negatives: There are many flaws in this film. The most egregious failure is that of the villain. He is not believable as an I.T. guy, and even less believable as a credible threat to anyone. It's also hard to believe Brosnan's character Regan's stupidity at not hiring equally talented I.T. or government people to go after the villain. He's a millionaire and decides to convolutedly go after the bad guy himself, even though Regan is useless at fighting back. The sound design was the more obvious failing in the film. There are many times where they just play music over a scene where you can't hear any of the actions on screen. It's a deliberate attempt by the film-makers to cover up the lack of good audio. But it makes the viewer wonder if sound isn't coming out of a speaker properly. But hey, what should I have expected from the director of ""A Good day to Die Hard""Everything else about this film was bland and forgettable. Any stupid, goofy moments are far-and-few between. And there wasn't many unintentional laughs. I'll forget about this film in 12 hours. So will 99% of viewers. Don't see it. If you want to see a far better, recent Brosnan thriller, watch ""No Escape"", a very fun, occasionally goofy heart-racer that you can switch your brain off and enjoy."
" Extremely predictable, slow and torturing film.
",-0.6124,0.5429,2017-02-03 00:00:00,4,"3 stars for the movie and an additional one for Pierce Brosnan. As a veteran actor, he knows how to act and he was the only anchor for some sanity. Extremely predictable, slow and torturing film. The movie could easily have been shortened by 30 minutes without affecting the plot or any good part. On the other hand, acting by James was very poor.The story is quite related to the 21st century and highlights a real issue but the script is weak and not that compelling.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie at at least 1.2x speed or don't even bother watching."
" Pierce Brosnan leads a strong cast in a loosely threaded thriller
",0.5719,0.9643,2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this movie more than most, largely for what I see as Pierce Brosnan's fierce adherence to the mindset and personality of a man from the C Suite. His easy acceptance and friendliness to a problem solver, and the way he later attempts to set boundaries when that problem solver becomes too personal. One moment in particular I actually rewound and watched again, when our IT guy shows up uninvited to a dinner party. Brosnan's responses and acting choices in that moment are perfect, as he realizes this guy could be become a problem himself. As has been said before, a movie set against a subtext of tech, law and finance should have done better research about those very systems. That could have made the difference between a modern ghost story and a true cautionary tale. Still enjoyed it though. Thanks Brosnan."

For my reaction the movie felt a bit needed more work. But I enjoyed it 10x more when I watched this movie by imagining it to be about James Bond's family! In the end I personally enjoyed it and watched it with family members about 3 times! I tried to use James Bond reference through out the movie and it really worked. I believe that this movie would have been blockbuster if they made it a James Bond reboot.If you ever had the interest to watch this movie, With that in mind I guarantee that this movie will be great! Just Imagine the main character to be James Bond but changed his identity 15 years later* to have a normal life. The movie could be simply be about James Bond after his life of a secret agent. And having a family a business and most of all luxurious high-tech life. Then he was faced with a hard situation that he can't control!"
