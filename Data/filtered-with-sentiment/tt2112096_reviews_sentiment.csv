" Absolutely Fabulous
",0.5709,0.8662,2020-08-22 00:00:00,8,"I was a big fan of the series, so when my neighbor who's never seen Ab Fab wanted to borrow my DVD I knew it isn't just for old fans of the show. We enjoyed the ridiculous Huki Muki event, Julia Sawalha (Saffy) made an awful old 70s song sound sweet and nostalgic, and the locations in France were - absolutely fabulous. Celia Imrie as catty Claudia Bing, Indeyarna Donaldson-Holness as Lola and many surprise cameos made the movie fun."
" They should never stop making these
",0.2235,0.9357,2020-05-02 00:00:00,10,Jennifer Saunders and Joanna lumley are the best comedy duo in the world! They are hysterical. This film is filled with hilarious jokes and guess appearances! The people that are leaving negative comments about the film clearly have no sense is humour. I hope they make another one! And then another one !
" As bad as I assumed
",-0.5423,0.9435,2020-04-14 00:00:00,4,"'Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie' is as bad as I assumed it would be. Admittedly, I've never watched an episode of its popular television series.It is better than most of its counterparts in regards to TV personalities hitting the big time, e.g. 'Keith Lemon: The Film' and 'Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie', but that doesn't mean it isn't a terrible film. Pointless, illogical plot alongside poor casting which relies on cameos.Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley do work nicely next to each other, even if it is Saunders doing most of the heavy lifting. In terms of laughs, of which there aren't many, Kathy Burke and Nick Mohammed are mildly amusing in their roles together. Some of the cameos are decent, namely from Jon Hamm and Rebel Wilson.The only memorable scene involves Joan Collins and Dame Edna Everage, which at least gave me a smile. Overall, Ab Fab's silver screen debut falls short."
" Totally Nuts
",-0.3804,0.6542,2020-02-08 00:00:00,8,"That's one nutty, zany, bonkers, fruitcake fest of a movie.The cast must have had a fabulous time and most viewers go away smiling or giggling.Great fun, but don't exact a sensible story line."
" Absolutely Brilliant!
",0.6581,0.9551,2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,I laughed till I cried - all the way through! You can't beat a bit of Eddy and Patsy antics to brighten your life up. In the movie they go from one disaster to the next with long suffering daughter Saffy attempting to have a 'normal' life. And we all love the great actress June Whitfield as Eddy's mother. It was the best cast with fabulous guest appearances. Loved it from start to finish!
" Relaxing Comedy
",0.6908,0.9874,2019-09-02 00:00:00,7,"Some People need to calm down.
This movie is relaxing, mindless fun, which one expects after 20 years. Not modern edgy material but relaxing comedy with characters already established entertaining in an environment of relaxing humour in a stable time span.
Which I think this movie delivers.
As a relaxing comedy without modern edgy expectations I can rewatch this movie.
If you have other expectations see the 20 years of history."
" Not that fabulous
",-0.4168,0.9028,2019-04-02 00:00:00,4,This is an movie adaptation of television show with the same name and stars Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley in the lead roles. The movie is good in bits and pieces and off course predictable. It has its own fun element if not a laugh riot. Acting is good by the lead stars but a bit disappointing from support cast. Screenplay is ok so as direction. This could've been a good movie provided director had did a little more hard work in developing the content. Overall an Ok movie
" Not meant for the big screen
",0.0,0.81,2019-02-16 00:00:00,6,"Higher rating because I love the show and the stoner conversation was a belter that had me howling. I think in a weird way the movie was missing that canned laughter, it felt way too quiet watching it. Like Bo announcing her arrival ""hi, hi, hi"" usually evokes a reaction from the audience, but here, it's nothing, too quiet. I think maybe this is not meant for the big screen. Still entertaining to watch non the less."
" 26 Year Fan, entertained but somwhat disappointed in the film!
",-0.4482,-0.8992,2019-01-13 00:00:00,5,"#1 problem? EDITING.What was up with the scenes that came across as short promos?
We had no character build up to Lola who is now 13, and a British accent yet grew up in Africa??? Makes no sense. Is willing to do what she did cuz she is more Edina than Sophie ? How is she driving at 13?Eddie seemed flat and subdued. None of her series vocal outrageousness.
Patsy seems unaged. Patsy was Patsy and was good.
I think Eddie should have had longer hair, too. She was too old looking for what was supposed to be her 60 years of age.It was just hard to follow, there was no continuance. I put this on the editors 100%. I am sure there was enough footage to make this better.Gran was not much more than a background prop. She deserved more, given she is gone now only 2 years later.
How did Bubble save enough on her salary to buy that home, even if she skimmed? So basically she embezzled?
Anyway.. sadly, chopped together, and hard to track what the real dilemma was. Running away cuz someone ""maybe"" died?"

She and Patsy head to Nice and try to lay low.There are star cameos, a thin story and a scatterbrained approach to humour.It would had worked better as an extended television episode but it fails to work as a movie.The world has moved on, people are less interested in public relations and the high world of fashion. They regard it as a bit silly.The film looks tired, Lumley and Saunders work well together but they are noticeably older.Like the wealthy lotharios in the clubs in Nice, they have moved on to younger models leaving Patsy and Edina behind."

The characters are extremely unlikeable and annoying throughout, made worse by two awful performances by Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Saunders. The are jokes incredibly bad and never made me laugh.

" Disappointing as a comedy, so-so as a drama
",-0.1779,0.9918,2018-06-04 00:00:00,4,"Jennifer Saunders should be applauded for her efforts, but things
did not come together in endeavor because the essential element that
made her show successful, copious humor, was difficult to find. Given her
pre-2012 specials, which easily could have been movies, the idea of making
this film was certainly reasonable. After watching the movie, which I had
highly anticipated, I was left a bit bewildered and wondering if I just
missed something. I decided to watch the movie again the next day, this time
looking specifically for the redeeming features. Rebel Wilson, in a fairly
brief appearance, added the most humor to the film as the sassy flight 
attendant - and this is mostly where the humor ended. Julia Sawalha as
always gave a fine interpretation of Saffy. Kathy Burke (Magda) and Chris Colfer did fine with what they were given, but were under-utilized given their 
strengths; the rest of the cast all gave reasonable performances. Indeyarna Donaldson-Holness as Jane was surprisingly good at her role and could easily have been given a greater presence in the film as well as more humor which I feel she would have delivered on. In the end however, the movie played out much more as a drama than a comedy. Sometimes these things work out and sometimes they don't. I will always remember and continue to watch
the series, which is rife with humor. As for the movie, I have nothing but respect for Saunders, but instead of adding this one to my collection, it will enter the world of Ebay."
" Quite funny
",0.4927,0.9884,2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Our two protagonists are still struggling to maintain an actively dissolute lifestyle on an increasingly minimal budget when a major opportunity raises its head. And then it all goes horribly wrong...For the benefit of our US and worldwide friends, Absolutely Fabulous (or AbFab, as it became known) was a BBC sitcom which ran for 41 episodes from 1992, though with some lengthy gaps between series. Written by Jennifer Saunders, she also played Edina Monsoon, an amoral and self-centred PR representative, mostly accompanied by Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley), an equally self-centred and perpetually drunk and drugged ex-model. I'll offer up a confession: I watched very little of AbFab on TV as I didn't care for the main characters and consequently didn't find the series very funny. I wasn't particularly looking forward to the movie, which I saw in a fairly full cinema with a mature audience. Who laughed a lot. As did I.Jennifer Saunders has broadened the appeal of the series by taking it out of the small TV studio locations: the final third of the film takes place in the South of France. Eddie and Patsy remain motivated solely by greed and selfishness (and Julia Sawalha as Eddie's daughter Saffy plays her conscience, as usual), but there is sufficient material here to make it clear that their lifestyle doesn't actually enhance their quality of life, and that Eddie may occasionally glimpse that this is the case.There is a decent story here - based on silliness admittedly, but it works - with some solid laughs: verbal, as well as some good knockabout humour. And there are a host of celebrity cameos from fashion and showbiz, ranging from blink and you'll miss 'em to rather more extended cameos (Lulu as herself, amusingly, delivers all her dialogue in broad Glaswegian).I enjoyed this rather more than I expected to, although I expect that it will not travel terribly well."
" As heavy, flaccid and ponderous as Edwina's backside
",0.0,0.9387,2018-04-27 00:00:00,3,"The series was very well written and was hilarious, but the movie suffers from a weak writing. There are some great ideas but they needed fleshing out along the insertion of gags to match the frequency and wittiness of the series.There is an inside joke that becomes a biting irony in that Jennifer Saunders had bet her long-time comedic partner Dawn French a considerable amount of money that she would have the script in her hands by a certain date. When the script arrived it had 30 pages of dialogue and direction, with the rest being page after page of ""blah, blah, blah"". This is directly touched on in the scene in the film and, frankly, most of the movie was ""blah, blah, blah.""Well, this is the last gasp of Ab Fab. There won't be another. It might have been better if they'd left it at the 20th anniversary episodes."
" Absolutely dreadful
",-0.4927,0.9893,2017-09-28 00:00:00,2,"When a minor character has the one funny bit out of the entire film, you know it wasn't written well. One line, out of the entire film, was funny.Bo and Marshall are especially terrible, thanks to the script. They shined in a prior bit, with the televangelism. Too bad they're given nothing of value to work with this time. Lumley is wonderful but she's given nothing funny to say or do. Even the bits she does have are often completely recycled. The entire thing seems like a long commercial for a film that is going to be made sometime in the future, when Saunders decides to care enough to work at it like she once did, long ago.I have written funnier (prototype) AbFab scripts myself in practically no time. How much time did Saunders put into this? 15 minutes?The format has nothing to do with the TV series. As I said, it's like a long commercial — a trailer masquerading as a movie. The filming is all very pretty and glamorous but nothing interesting happens. All the characters are looking back at themselves, obliquely, instead of charging forward into new development.Lumley clearly is begging for a vehicle for her enthusiasm and talent. I can write one; Saunders cannot. It's bizarre, too — because at her peak she was the better writer. The original series, except for the last episode or two, was so brilliant.Aside from the aforementioned singular funny line, which aged badly upon seeing the film a second time — there was one scene-stealing bit of body language humor from an even more minor character. Too bad that the scene collapsed into bad writing in short order."
" A guide to how to get away with a murder!
",-0.7177,0.9961,2017-09-14 00:00:00,5,"I have never seen the original television series, but I came across and found it interesting to try, only to realise in my watch that it was not what I thought of it. Yeah, definitely my disadvantage was that I didn't know the characters, the universe and all the basics. Those who loved the show might enjoy it better, since they know what to expect from it. I was like looking for a proper intro. The introduction of everything, as I'm not familiar with anything out of it. But it did not come, the story just went on and on from the opening itself. I was confused what's going on, who is who and et al.It took almost half of the film to be comfortable with the scenario of the tale. Once I was there, I thought it was funny in places, yet I did not feel like to have a laugh. Again, I blame myself for missing out the fun for not knowing them very well. It never occurred to me before. I have seen many films that proceeded by its television series which I haven't seen. It looked short and the pace was excellent, so I did not get bored, except not getting the overall film properly. Otherwise, I would have rated it better. I think the people like me should be careful while picking it. Other than that it is an okay film, not a bad film.5/10"
" It's only really bad if you paid $12 to see it in the theater
",-0.5849,0.1263,2017-08-22 00:00:00,6,"""Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie"" from 2016 stars Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley - who else - and the rest of the cast from the TV show.Edwina (Saunders) is accused of pushing Kate Moss into the river, and probably killing her, during a party. Then Edwina and Patsy are afraid they've killed Bubble (Jane Horrocks) in yet another drowning, so they decide to leave the country. There is already a nationwide search for Edwina for Kate Moss' murder. They go to Cannes, taking Saffy's daughter Lola with them because she has credit cards. Patsy's plan is to look up a wealthy beau (Barry Humphries) from years ago and convince him to get married. Things take a decided left turn.There are many funny things in this movie - it's really for fans of the show, and if you're British it's even better, because many of the guest stars are famous in Britain and not here.If I'd paid $12 to see this, I would have been mighty disappointed, so I can understand the bad reviews. The cast is terrific, it was wonderful to see them all again, and Edwina's speech at the end is priceless. The guest stars don't add much, and as a feature film, it doesn't make it.This is a slightly longer TV episode with lots of guest stars thrown in, and that's about it."
" It's a bit of a laugh ""at times"" and a far cry from the TV series
",0.128,-0.7704,2017-06-25 00:00:00,6,"The film steals at least two scenes and one shot from other movies.I recognised Some Like It Hot and To Catch A Thief among others.See what you can spot.Also, not having any interest whatsoever in the British celebrity scene, the Cameos went way beyond the throw-up point."
" REALLY don't understand all the complaints
",-0.4019,0.9818,2017-06-24 00:00:00,9,"I really don't understand all the complaints / negative reviews / low ratings. Maybe one has to be a true long-time fan of the TV Series - - From, as the kids once said, ""back in the day."" I can't imagine such fans - who have watched the show as it aired over the past 3 decades - would REALLY find this movie to be so bad that, as one reviewer put it, she/he walked out of the theatre (wasting $30+) after only 30 mins thinking, sarcastically, that there would be more laughs ""at the local ambulance depot.""I had been waiting for the movie for YEARS, as have thousands of fans, and when it finally came out I was so disappointed because of the reviews. I hadn't yet watched the movie, and was dreading it because of the negative reviews and comments. Then I watched it ... and was very pleasantly surprised. I take a lot into consideration when giving a 1 - 10 rating on IMDb; one of my considerations is - and I know it is rather vague - how the movie or TV show was ""for what it is."" For example, it is generally ridiculous to criticize an old scifi movie for bad special effects. One has to take into consideration factors such as the era, the budget, and more. AbFab The Movie is not scifi, obviously, but using similar methodology rating it for what it is, among other things, along with the jokes/humor, how it fits with the series, the acting, etc. ... And for me the movie was a 9. Yes, I'm biased as a long-time AbFab super fan and so, as I said earlier, maybe you have to be such a fan to appreciate the movie. That said, however, even in the case of someone who had never seen the TV show and knew nothing about Abfab ... I can't imagine that they would find the movie totally lacking in humor or merit. It's lighthearted entertainment ... never intended to be a masterpiece of cinema."
" Has its moments but very hit and miss
",-0.3172,0.0342,2017-06-23 00:00:00,6,"Several years on from when we last saw Patsy and Eddy, Patsy is still in her fashion critic role but Eddie's fortunes have waned. Her list of PR clients is limited and low-key and her memoirs are not going to get published. While attempting to gain Kate Moss as a client, Eddie accidentally pushes her into the River Thames. Moss does not reappear and Eddie becomes a murder suspect, and Public Enemy Number 1. To escape the publicity Eddie and Patsy head for Nice.Being a fan of the TV series I did not have great expectations for this movie. TV-to-movie conversions seldom work and in this case the TV series finished four years previously and was pretty much done long before that. In the end, I was right about the conversion aspect - there's not enough material to sustain a feature film and the movie is festooned with silly scenes to pad out the time. The characters haven't aged well, and Joanna Lumley's script has not really adapted to their aging, seeming to still be based in the 90s in terms of character traits. Saffy / Julia Sawalha and Bubble / Jane Horrocks are particularly hard done by in this regard. This said, its not all bad. There is a great swipe at the pretentiousness of the fashion industry and the superficiality of the media. There are also a few very funny moments. While the main characters feel like they're misplaced in time, and are living off old glories, some of the secondary characters make up for this. Kathy Burke as Magda is particularly entertaining.Ultimately quite uneven with just enough good bits to make it likable."
" Absolutely....what a mess....
",0.0,-0.9791,2017-06-04 00:00:00,2,"If this succeeds in anything, this big screen version of the 1990's British cult sitcom proves to me the ridiculousness of the fashion industry and the pretentious people who work in it. Leading ostentatious lives, these are the most absurd elements of society who thrive on drama and ridiculous trends. Jennifer Saunders and Joanne Lumley seem stuck in time which has marched on by and left them eternally corked. The entire family still lives together even though daughter Saffie obviously cannot stand her mother Edina. Now in her 90's, mother June Whitfield seems numbed by the absurdity of the situation. While funny on TV, Patsy and Edina seem out of their minds and just nasty in their big screen debut.Trying too hard to be gay and hip, that element of this film is overly obnoxious and stereotypical. They are cartoon characters in every way they can be. The premise of Patsy and Edina becoming notorious simply because they may or may not have been responsible for the accidental death of Kate Moss is ridiculous. Dizzy Bubbles wears the most absurd outfits with inflated hashtags on her top that I wanted to pop with that stupid selfie stick she carries around. The costumes seem like the aftermath of an explosion at ""Wicked"" backstage. With the trend of bringing back old shows either in TV or movie form, this should be the guide as to how not to do it. I found this almost instantly to be beyond crude and insipid."

It's nothing compared to the series. I guess they are just too old now to play the characters from the series. It just didn't work. Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley play of course the same characters but the chemistry is just not there anymore. Plus the story-line isn't great either for a movie. The character of Bubble played by Jane Horrocks is just painful to watch. While in the past I was laughing with every episode I don't think I laughed once during the entire movie. And I'm pretty sure I still have the same sense of humor as in the past. Don't watch this movie, just stick to the series."
" Absolute disaster!
",-0.6588,0.8911,2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,Honestly I wasn't expecting much but nothing prepared me for this. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie is easily one of the worst films I have seen in my life. And for those who don't know me that is saying something since I am quite old and have seen a lot. I had hoped it would at least be on par with Zoolander 2 but sadly it's far worse. The biggest problem of the film is that it simply is not funny. Too many jokes that miss their mark even when I was trying to be as open and receptive as possible. I really tried hard to get into this film and let the silliness overwhelm me which was one of the strongest elements of the original show. However here the craziness is toned down considerably. Even the crudest jokes weren't of the same level as in the show. I get that the majority of the cast have gotten older and that perhaps they felt that they should act more their age although that would go directly against the premise of the show and defeating it's purpose. Whatever the reason or motivation it destroyed most of the fun. Then there are the cameos. I don't even know where to begin with those. None of them made an impact. Sure it's always nice to recognize famous faces but if you would have them left out you would not have missed them. Nothing remarkable has been done with these names and that is a big shame if you ask me. The acting was acceptable and for the most part Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Saunders played out the characters as we know them. Little less energetic and kinetic maybe but that is understandable they have gotten older of course. Although it has to be said that Joanna Lumley still looks great. I wished the same could be said about Saunders. She messed up her face so much with I presume botox that it looked like she had some mask on or something similar. Very weird and super distracting. Absolutely Fabulous the show was witty and sharp. This movie is the opposite. It's a total waste of time and I can't think of a single excuse to warrant a view. So don't. AVOID!

Lola is staying with her mother Saffy at the house. Of course, mother and Bubble are still around. Eddy's book deal falls through. She's desperate to get Kate Moss as a client but ends up pushing her into the Thames. With Kate Moss feared dead, Patsy loses her job and the girls escape to the south of France with Lola. Patsy is looking to marry rich Charlie from the old days.Expanding a TV show into a theatrical movie is not always an easy task. The laugh track is gone. Even the old kitchen is gone. Like Entourage, this tries to fill up the empty spaces with cameos. Some are fine like Stella McCartney, Lulu, and Baby Spice who are all veterans of the show. Kate Moss is a good MacGuffin. However, the big screen is simply too big for the show. The best moments are the sharp jabs from the show's regulars. Eddy and Patsy fighting with Saffy is comfort food. Instead of trying to go bigger, it really should concentrate on the characters and their relationships."

Not one single time we felt close to a laugh. We're from Denmark, and this movie reminded us about all those really bad danish comedy movies from the 80's with bad jokes, bad music, bad cuttings and bad everything. It's unbelievalble thats this movie is written by the same person who wrote the absolute fabulous TV-comedy. But then again.. It's seen before and It's well-known that comedy-shorts became flops when transformed for cinema. Laurel & Hardy, mr. Bean and others are on that list. So be warned! I really felt I wasted my money on this movie. It's bad.... really bad, and It's hard for me to understand that Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley could do this. But then again.. money has It's own way to persuade. Unfortunately I was persuaded to waste both time and money on this dilettante show."
" AbSad
",0.0,0.9971,2017-04-02 00:00:00,6,"I own every DVD of every AbFab show, and I still enjoy them today as I did when they were on BBC. I wish I could rate this a 10, but I am being extremely generous rating it a 6.What went wrong: Jennifer Saunders wrote a weak script devoid of the essence that made the show what it was in the 90s. It actually started out pretty good. It opens at a fashion catwalk show, and the stumbling duo make a funny entrance. The film kept up that tone until Kate Moss lands in the water. Then, it's like we are watching another movie. Saunders reverts to a strong story-line, and the movie begins to go south from there on. The original show was never so much about the story as it was about the interaction between the cast members, the situations they found themselves in, (like in the Courtroom after being busted for something usually relating to drugs) as well as the slapstick antics pulled off by the fidgety, head shaking Saunders and the tramp, her pal Lumley; both were on a 24 hour buzz from the 70s, consuming every drug in the universe 24/7 to the point where walking was a full time job. Of course we can't ever forget about Bubble (Edna's PA). I haven't decided whether she was under utilized in this installment, or out to lunch. Either way, it was disappointing to me, because she was one of my favorite characters on the TV show. I also thought Saunders overdid the Botox. She was almost expressionless and appeared to be plastic with little of her former energy. When she fell out of her car as she did a thousand times in the TV show, we laughed. Now, it looked like it hurt, and it seemed difficult for her to do. Perhaps she was actually too fat at this point in her life, to comfortably play her fat self character Edna.The direction by Mandie Fletcher was embarrassing to watch. The script played out so convoluted, and disjointed, it might have been directed by Barnum and Bailey. However, the HD cinematography was spectacular, colorful, and beautiful to watch; the wardrobe was glorious, and so were locations chosen for the film.Also on the plus side, it was great to see the old gang back together again, and a special shout out to June Whitfield, who at 92 years of age, gave the best performance of the lot, and had lost none of her character's essence. Her performance, along with Julia Sawalha's surprising singing abilities, were bonus surprises that I truly enjoyed. I really hate to see AbFab go out like this, but you reap what you sew, and Saunders fell a bit short of being a master seamstress in this attempt at a modern day AbFab."

",0.0,0.8334,2017-03-06 00:00:00,5,"A movie produced on the same material 25 years after the heyday of a television show will take a toll on quality. At the time, the Dawn French / Joana Lumley show traded on its subversive material and outrageous performances. Since then the world has moved dramatically toward the outpost the two established for themselves putting the show's aesthetic somewhere in the middle of the culture. So relying on the same shock value jokes from the early 90's results in the film's now mildly eye-raising but still mostly funny lines. All of the standbys from the original appear: Eddie gives her daughter poor parenting advice, her daughter lectures her to be more conservative, Lumley pulls out her ""Pat Stone"" routine at one point, she blacks out, etc., etc., etc. Vintage stuff if a little worn. The softness of the script benefits from a very long list of cameos although American audiences will miss many of the local British faces who didn't quite become global names. In short, like ""Zoolander 2"", AbFab the movie relies more on nostalgia than good writing but for hardcore fans that may be enough."
" Time to put this one to rest
",0.0,0.9652,2017-02-05 00:00:00,5,"I grew up watching Absolutely Fabulous, the TV series and flat out loved it. Like many series, as the show wore on it got less and less funny, but I chalked that up to growing pains and a mostly disinterested cast. Still, despite the warning signs, I was very excited when I heard that show creator and star Jennifer Saunders was planning this movie. I think that the two leads, Edie and Patsy, remain ever hilarious and I wanted to see how these two unhip, aging woman, would react to the social media obsessed world. First, the good: the film has a bigger budget and it shows. Sets are bolder (Edina's house is notably MUCH bigger than in the series) and director Mandie Fletcher and Chris Goodger work flawlessly together to make the movie look cinematic in a way that is true to the TV show while showing off the much bigger budget of the movie. Secondly Saunders and Lumley are hilarious as always. It's funny to think on it now, but they were only in their 30s when the show premiered but the great thing about their characters is that their characters only get better as they age since they're supposed to be uncool anyway. Third great thing is the Kate Moss plot, and Kate Moss herself who shines in her brief role. Basically the entire gist of the plot hangs on her, even though she doesn't feature much, but she nails every scene she's in. The rest, unfortunately is trash and that's really down to Saunders screenplay. First off, even though some of it is funny, their aren't enough jokes to really bring the thing together. Second, a lot of the jokes are really mean spirited. There are a lot of jokes and an entire subplot that makes fun of trans people. Now the thing I remember about the original series was that even though Edie and Patsy were mean horrible selfish people the jokes were always at THEIR expense. When they were rude to people they came off as the bad ones, and Saffy was always their to act embarrassed by their behaviour and call them out. But that doesn't really exist here. It's a case of Saunders punching down instead of punching up and it's the sort of material that doesn't look particularly good in 2016 and will only age worse. Second there are some uncomfortable racist moments. A white woman portraying an Asian designer and Jane Horrocks sporting blackface to portray Shirley Bassey. They add nothing to the plot and really seem tone deaf and cringey. It's a real shame, and the movie has me wondering if Saunders and Abfab were actually as good as I remember it or if the awful bits were always there and just something I didn't remember. A real missed opportunity."
