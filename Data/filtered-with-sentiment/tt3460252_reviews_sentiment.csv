" Great Western whodunnit with a too long playtime
",0.6249,0.3919,2021-03-17 00:00:00,7,"At it's best moments (Jackson's monologue about his Johnson, Mexican stand-off, chapters in non-chronological order) The Hateful Eight rivals QT's best work. But unfortunately this film's pacing is a bit of an issue. The opening stagecoach sequence (clocking in at almost 40 minutes) is an overlong introduction scene. And there could have been some trimming here and there inside the tavern. Sally Menke's (Tarantino's former editor who passed away several years earlier) is sorely missed. Watch out for a chilling, Oscar winning score by Maestro Morricone"
" Best Tarantino Movie so far
",0.6369,0.9122,2021-03-17 00:00:00,10,This Movie became literally my favorite Movie of all time. Just so Perfect like everything Tarantino creates.
" Amazing...
",0.0,0.9583,2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,"""The Hateful Eight"" is a Crime- Drama movie in which we watch a bounty hunter and his prisoner seeking a shelter. They found it in a cabin where they meet some other people too. Each and every one of them has something to do and say about anything, and soon things won't go as planned.I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot, much of suspense and the direction which was made by Quentin Tarantino was simply amazing. The interpretations of both Samuel L. Jackson who played as Major Marquis Warren and Kurt Russell who played as John Ruth were very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Walton Goggins' who played as Sheriff Chris Mannix, Jennifer Jason Leigh's who played as Daisy Domergue and Tim Roth's who played as Oswaldo Mobray. Finally, I have to say that ""The Hateful Eight"" is a nice movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will enjoy it and it will leave you speechless."
" Fantastic!
",0.5983,0.3612,2021-03-09 00:00:00,10,Tarantino does it again. This film is a work of art. See it. You can thank me later.
" Love it!
",0.6696,-0.3544,2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,"While it's not his best film (it's far too long and indulgent at times), Tarantino absorbs the audience into a scene, compelling you to look at each and every inch of it--indicative of many vintage films (his usual film playground)."
" The Hateful Eight 2015 Review
",-0.4939,0.9267,2021-03-05 00:00:00,9,"I watched The Extended Version of this film to get a fuller experience and have more stuff fleshed out because I felt that was the proper way to watch this.The Hateful Eight is like a crime / thriller / western / who-done-it all wrapped into one.
Sam Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh both deserved to win oscars for this film, I was so immersed at times I absolutely adore both of their performances. And although Walton Goggins ""Sheriff Mannix"" was annoying and problematic at first, I ended up really enjoying his character.
This film really had me questioning what it was at all times, things kept progressing with little twists and turns that kept me super inthralled. It feels theatrical at times with a very charming setting with a reason to never leave and some cozy cinematography. Also, never once did I feel tired or exhausted from this 3 1/2 - 4 hour film.
Not to mention this is a incredibly beautiful film too.Amazing work all around, if you've seen Tarantino's bests, this is right up that alley.
Also, as I go through all the Tarantino films, Tim Roth is becoming one of my favorite actors!"
" Tarantino never misses
",0.1695,0.802,2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Stuck at home with the pandemic and the family catching up on films. We didn't get to watch this because I read a few bad reviews at the time it came out.
Story was clever and pulled me right in. We enjoyed it as a family. Characters, dialogue and enough action for all. A treasure we missed before but one of the best so far in 2021."
" Too slow paced, watch it at 3x speed.
",0.0,-0.8658,2021-03-01 00:00:00,5,"No need for dialog to understand the story. Just listen to the first 15 minutes, then put it in fast forward. Western with useless and free violence. Chronology is just after the end of Civil War, while peoples returns back to where they should be, for past life or new life."
" Is this movie just Reservoir Dogs disguised as a Western?
",-0.2732,-0.9655,2021-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Ok i'm going to be blunt here.... Is it just me or is this movie literally just a remake of Reservoir Dogs but disguised as a western???? Sorry for thinking this but Seriously, it's a bunch of people inside a single building, fighting and arguing and killing each other (Back story is shown at various times).We even have Michael Madsen and Tim Roth in this movie, both of these actors are actually in Reservoir Dogs....And to really nail the coffin shut think about the title, ""The Hateful Eight"". How many main characters are in Reservoir Dogs?We have Joe, Nice Guy Eddie, Mr Blonde, Mr Pink, Mr Brown, Mr White, Mr Orange and Mr Blue. That's 8 characters. Bravo Mr Tarantino. You caught us all by the short and curlies.... Sorry guys but there's the truth... The Hateful Eight is just a Reservoir Dogs reskin....I enjoyed it to a degree but clocking in at almost three hours it's just too damn long for what it's trying to achieve... The actors you really can tell they all had a lot of fun playing their roles and working on this movie together and it's not hard to see why since multiple actors in this movie have all worked together before and worked with QT before and if you read through the trivia section for this movie there are multiple Django Unchained Easter eggs in this one too.My biggest complaint is the format it was shot in.... 70mm for inside a building???? If most of this movie took place outdoors and featured lots of long distance back drops it would be fine but when majority of it takes place inside a building it's an absolute waste of resources. It painfully reduces the frame size on screen and it's like watching it through a helmet with a long rectangle cut out.The Hateful Eight is worth watching at least once but settle in for the long haul it's a remarkably long film with dialogue overload as with most QT films....Bottom line.... Love it or hate it but it's literally just Reservoir Dogs in different clothes."
" Brilliant!

Such an awesome story that really ramps up the tension like The Thing. Couldn't recommend it any more."

" Damn Tarantino ! You are still a Genius.
",-0.4574,0.9366,2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,You Guys Need To Watch This Masterpiece.There are too much dialogue and slow movie but after the first half you will enjoy the movie. Kurt And Jackson's Oscar Worthy Performance ðŸ”¥Some kind of uniqueness in every dialogue such a brilliant piece of work.Thanks Quentin. Looking Forward For Your Next Movie.
" Another Tarantino Gem
",0.0,0.8779,2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those classic Tarantino films that gets better every time you watch it. You like it the first time, you love it the fifth time and by the tenth time you can't get enough of it. Tarantino's casting skills are unmatched. He gets the permit actor for every part and gets incredible performances from everyone. His work with Samuel Jackson has been top notch over and over again."
" Masterpiece
",0.6249,0.6696,2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,"I Love This Movie And It's Really Long At 168 Minutes Long With The Cast (Kurt Russel, Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh)!"
" Awful. Just awful
",-0.7184,-0.9118,2021-02-14 00:00:00,2,"The cast was wasted with that script. Tarantino can't do nuance or subtlety. A boring rehash of the same tired old tropes with cringey dialog and dumb plot that appears to have come straight from some pubescent schoolboy's imagination. Meandering monologues from one-dimensional characters, with only one standout, Walton Goggins. An unentertaining waste of two and a half hours."
" not Tarantino's best
",-0.5216,0.9885,2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"The Hateful Eight is not one of QT's best films, but it's still pretty good. The direction, screenplay, and characters/acting are all great. Sam L. Jackson gave an amazing performance, his character was great. The film is a mystery, but it's a western at heart and it doesn't really work. It's a really good concept, but the mystery isn't built up all that well, until really late in the film and there's one layer mystery that I found to be kind of stupid and unnecessary. It ended up killing one of the characters that really should've stuck around, not a good decision. I feel like the story should've taken a much different direction at that point. I think the biggest issue is that the film doesn't decide to be a mystery until over an hour in. It is then where an actual plot comes into play. That first hour of the film should've been cut down to maybe 30 minutes, it would've made a better exposition. There were a bunch of other issues I had, but they're relatively minor and aren't worth mentioning. Overall, it's good, despite all its problems. I'd just expect a little better from Tarantino. I rate The Hateful Eight a 7/10."
" Great at first
",0.6249,0.3612,2021-02-05 00:00:00,7,The movie up until Samuel L Jackson ends up in bed is a 9 out of 10 but after that it's a 5 out of 10. Great first 3/4 of movie let down by a poor ending
" WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT BY THE HANGMAN, YOU HANG!!
",0.0,0.9987,2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The film started off slowly building the background story and slowly introducing us to the characters such as Major Marquis Warren played brilliantly by Samuel L Jackson and I feel brilliantly undersells it because that may have rivalled Pulp Fiction's Jules when it comes to characters. Warren comes across a stagecoach driven by O.B. (James Parks) inside of which had Kurt Russell's John Ruth who was another massively important character who like Warren is a bounty hunter and next to him was his bounty Daisy Domergue who was brilliantly portrayed by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Little while down the road we come across the future Red Rock sheriff Maddix (Walter Goggins). All 5 continue riding sharing some typical Tarantino witty dialogue that I am always engaged by. We then meet up with the rest of the characters important to the story at Millie's Haberdashery. Oswaldo Mobray probably my second favourite character played by Tim Roth, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), Bob the Mexican (Damien Bashir) and General Smithers (Bruce Dern). After several scenes of getting to know the characters with alot more typical Tarantino dialogue characters start getting killed in one way or another. It is brutal at times where some say the violence is over the top but if you've seen a Tarantino flick before you should know what to expect. It goes from a western to a who done it kind of story and this is where Samuel L Jackson stole the show, it was truly are marvel watching his performance on screen. We do come across some other characters who are important to the end story but its better to watch it to fully grasp the gravity of the ending.Technically its very hard to rank any of QT movies because they're all of a ridiculously high standard but I rate this very high. In production the script got leaked and we were nearly robbed of this being made at all. Thankfully QT calmed down and made the film. Shot in 70mm it gave it the old school feel of movie making which was so cool, writing was so on point and the casting was perfect to show QT vision on the screen. The score was hugely important too and the fact QT finally got to work with the legend that is Ennio Morricone was a fantastic gift.I write reviews for fun and usually just a few lines to convey my thoughts but I go into greater depth for things I get great enjoyment out of and great directors like Quentin Tarantino warrent my timeThe films an under appreciated masterpiece and at 168 minutes never feels too long and worth holding up next to the likes of Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained, happy viewing"
" A movie to see over and over
",0.0,0.923,2021-01-29 00:00:00,9,This movie has a lot of great acting. The characters of the this movie are well played. It is violent but I find it also very funny at times. The music and scenery fit right in with whole creativity of the film.
" Tarantino's best film.
",0.6369,0.9477,2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I've always been a fan of Tarantino's work, but The Hateful Eight took the crown by leagues. A whodunnit mystery set in a shack in the middle of nowhere amidst a blizzard, ten people are trapped in this location - all with highly volatile tempers, charged emotions and... guns. As the mystery unfolds, we get to see a truly interesting and unique set of events that transpire, leading to quite an incredible ending in my opinion. The cinematography is brilliant as always, and the cast is nothing but fantastic, with Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell playing wonderfully written characters. Between the western theme, the great writing and the star-studded cast, this is most likely one of the best films I've watched."
" Tarantino Violence in its finest
",-0.6249,0.824,2021-01-17 00:00:00,9,"I loved it and personally for me one of my top 3 Tarantino movies with Pup Fiction numero uno. I like all his movies and the way he tells a story, sound track and not to forget the casting. He seems to get it perfect or at least near perfect. He appears to understand his target audience but his movies not for everyone."
" I'll keep this brief.
",0.0,0.7977,2021-01-14 00:00:00,9,"I'm a big fan of QT's movies yet this evaded me for over five years, I was aware it got quite a lot of hate from certain quarters. Finally watched it and enjoyed it. The basic plot and setting suits the movie and makes its lengthy runtime seem short, which is a miracle. Ignore the stupid low score reviews and watch it if you like QT films, you won't be disappointed."
" You have got to hand it to him
",0.4939,0.9896,2021-01-11 00:00:00,8,"So, this is Tarantino's take on the western and it's good, really good. In some ways this is a throw back to the early Tarantino; a small number of characters, a key flashback scene, one big scene where every plays of each other etc. There are a number of strengths to this movie; great acting, great cinematography and a great score. But where it really excels is in the script and the story. It's depth of character is superb, the writing witty and detailed and it's in the main well paced with a good (both gruesome and funny) ending. The reason it's gets 8/10 and not higher is that this is a long film and the middle does creak a bit. Overall this is a good movie, like only Tarantino can make them."
" Frontier Psychiatry
",0.0,0.5789,2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"The final movie, of our Tarantino Retrospective was ""The Hateful Eight"" a violent Western. It was notable on its release in the UK that the Cineworld chain (of which my local cinema is one) were not allowed to show the film, so I had to travel further afield to see it, which made the showing somewhat more of an event. Though I remember being a little underwhelmed at the time, watching now for what I think is the 3rd time - there was an awful lot to enjoy in the dialogue and story.Two bounty hunters, Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson) and John Ruth (Kurt Russell) meet on a snowy Wyoming Road and agree to travel together to Minny's Haberdashery, a trading post and rest spot, to wait out the blizzard. Ruth is transporting a prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be tried in a nearby town. They arrive at the cabin and find it already inhabited by a collection of colourful characters who may not all be what they seem.I feel like ""The Hateful Eight"" is one of those moves that benefits from repeat viewings once you know the plot. Once everyone's real agendas are revealed you can enjoy the dialogue and interplay between the characters as Tarantino is back to his scripting best here, maybe not quite to the heights of ""Pulp Fiction"" but right up there. Better than in either ""Basterds"" or ""Hollywood"" the blending of Tarantino's dialogue, time jumping plot preferences and the Grindhouse violence work together to create a story, rather than one aspect undermining the rest.It's probably his best-looking film too, with wide vistas of the mountain ranges and snow swamped passes and finally landing that full Morricone score that he has wanted for so long.So, what are my conclusions from this retrospective look at Quentin Tarantino's films? That not every film is the classic that I thought it was perhaps, that some of the films I thought I liked a lot were a little underwhelming, and some of those considered ""minor"" efforts were better than I thought they were. He's still the most ""event"" film director on the planet and it's hard to find too many of his rivals with a career as complete as his. I'll see you for film 10 at some point."

Yes there were times if great tension but it took way too long for anything to really start happening, I found myself bored after the first 40 minutes.The only character development was in Mannix, everyone else was a waste of screen time.The movie was shot beautifully, but it was just too boring to write home about."

",0.0,-0.6636,2020-12-29 00:00:00,6,"The headline says most of it. Tarantino's use of banal dialogue as a device has long since worn out its luster. Most scenes are painful to watch, because you know what is coming: repetition of banal lines that were never interesting to begin with. The excessive amount of gore adds nothing. Certain segments defy credibility in the interest of exploitation-type effect, e.g. the General Smithers bit. The usual Tarantino craft ensures a degree of quality that lands a 6."
" Disappointing and extremely boring.
",-0.6997,0.991,2020-12-28 00:00:00,4,"We have known for a long time the fixation that Quentin Tarantino has for westerns and for making eye-catching films, full of style and choreographed action, which seem simply caricatures. This film quite honors this director's obsessions.The plot is difficult, and it is necessary to pay attention. On a trip en route to the city of Red Rock, a stagecoach takes refuge from an impending snowstorm in a kind of horse molting season. It transports a bounty hunter, who takes a criminal for whom he will ask for the reward when he delivers it to the local executioner. They were joined by another passenger, a black military officer. At the station, they discover that the owner is not there, but had left an employee taking care. There are also some other mysterious characters, including an old Confederate general. It doesn't take long for everyone to start distrusting each other and provoking each other, and for the blood to start flowing.After having seen - and greatly appreciated - ""Django Unchained"", I expected something more from this film. It's a dull film, too long, wasting time in scenes that could have been shortened. Much of the film, I would say half, consists of seeing the characters talking and doubting each other. The fact that this took place in a confined space could have helped, making the atmosphere more tense and claustrophobic, but the result was the opposite, with that small room surprisingly resembling the Palace of Versailles. After some reading, I realized that Tarantino seems to have made the film after staging a play with the same script. This helps to understand the choices of the director, who limited himself to taking a play to the cinema. Frankly, if I wanted to see the theater I would buy the ticket and go to see it in the big room, with the actors on stage, right?Having Tarantino direct a film seems to act as a gimmick for great actors, no matter how bad the film or the character is. So it's no wonder that the film's cast is a nest of stars like Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Walton Goggins and Bruce Dern. For me, the film was designed to give Samuel L. Jackson all the protagonism, but Jennifer Jason Leigh takes the carpet from him on more than one occasion, due to the sharpness of her character, the quality of her dialogues and the irony and humor with which she acts. In fact, she won an Oscar with this film. This does not mean that Samuel L. Jackson did a bad job, in fact he is excellent and the second actor that stands out the most in the film, but she was better and fit the character brilliantly. The rest of the cast does not disappoint, but neither does it stand out or be able to do so. I think Bruce Dern did a very good job, but his character is largely secondary and serves only to Jackson to make a long and boring monologue about the way he killed his son, which ends with a predictable outcome shooting.Technically, the film has all the style that marks the filmography of its director. Filmed in its 70 mm format, it has a positively well-made cinematography, but wasted by everything or almost everything happening in such a limited space. The length of the film, as I said, far exceeds the acceptable. The sets and costumes are good enough, but I would doubt the reliability and historical rigor, because Tarantino never really wanted to know that in any of his films. The special effects are good and the final part of the film is soaked in liters of fake blood and the shootings are visually stunning. The soundtrack, signed by Ennio Morricone, is good, has a good environmental effect, but the film does them no honor."

",0.0,-0.9985,2020-12-22 00:00:00,9,"John Ruth was a bounty hunter and was taking the $ 10,000 daisy to red rock. He encountered a black man in the Wyoming winter and took him into his carriage. Major Warren showed the man the letter from Lincoln to him, and when Daisy spat at the letter, they both fell out of the carriage because the man had chained the woman to him so she wouldn't run away. Warren got out of the carriage too and they saw a man running to them. It was Chris Mannix who said he was the new sheriff of red rock. The four of them continued on the road but took refuge in Minnie's Haberdashery due to blizzard. A Mexican man said that Minnie and Dave are not here and that he runs the place. Warren found this suspicious, but they continued. There was an old man in the Confederate Army and his name was Smithers. The man was there to find his lost son in the Wyoming mountains, where he came to hunt the black. It was Warrens who killed his son. Before describing how he killed his son, he put a gun next to the man and killed him when he tried to shoot him. There was John Gage, who said he wrote his life, and a short English man who said he was an executioner. It was funny that they had to nail it every time to be able to close the door. After eating the stew made by the Mexican man, someone poisoned the coffee on the stove. Meanwhile, daisy was serenading with the guitar. After drinking it, John Ruth and the man's chariot driver died. Before she died, Ruth tried to kill the woman, but she shot the man. Warren lined up the rest of them against the wall except Chris because the men vomited blood before Chris started drinking so it was clear he was innocent. Chris and Warren tried to figure out who gave the poison with guns in hand. Warrens uncovered the blood on the seat of the sweet dave and was sure they were killed because minnie hated the mexican and would not entrust her place to a mexican then cellar and chris shot each other after someone shot the warren from the balls from the basement. In fact, they were all members of a gang, and one of them was Daisy's brother. When his brother from the basement held out his head, Warrens killed him. The men started talking on the daisy floor in bed and the woman tried to get Chris to her side. He mentioned that the Jody gang would kill them if they killed the woman. The cellar was dying on the sofa at that time, he also got involved in the bargain, and when he reached under the gage for the gun hidden, the Warren shot the gage and the executioner, but he ran out of bullet when he tried to shoot the woman. Chris fainted without bleeding and she cut off Ruth's arm and tried to reach for the knife, but Chris woke up and injured her. They did not want to shoot the woman, but instead hung her from the ceiling as Ruth wanted, and she died with Ruth's severed arm on her arm. Chris Lincoln asked for his letter and read it aloud, and warrens and the man died of bleeding too. It was a great movie with the snowy mountains of Wyoming, Minnie's Herbedeshary and Lincoln letter detail."

",-0.4939,0.6542,2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"The Hateful Eight is one of Quentin Tarantino's most underrated films. Which is saying a lot because it was very well-received. With a star-studded cast, lots of gory action, and sweet Tarantino dialogue. One critique I hear people talk about when they're talking about this film is how long it is, which I can absolutely understand. But I think it works to the movie's favor, as the longer the movie goes on, the more tension builds up, which leads to an epic finale. Really, this is just a really good film."
" Awful
",-0.4588,0.3612,2020-12-12 00:00:00,1,If you like this you must be deranged. It's for people without taste.
" Always a savant
",0.0,0.9081,2020-12-10 00:00:00,10,"Tarantino's a savannt who relishes in the pure joy of storytelling and never budges from his devotion to presenting characters as the primary subject and driving force of the movie. Perhaps it is similar to a play, which might be why I enjoy it so."
" Occasionally a fun ride, but unsatisfying
",0.2508,0.9889,2020-12-06 00:00:00,6,"Massively self-indulgent but the upside is Tarantino's indulgence is at least skillful, so we'll take it. Acting and cinematography are superb. Tarantino, too, adds his own flavor of wokeness which, like Django, straddles the uncertain line between commentary and exploitation trash. If we're offended, we can just dismiss it as another over-the-top ingredient of Tarantino's style. If we love it, then the table-turning has satisfying gore galore.In the end (which takes FOREVER to get to), the fault is Tarantino's. This is a beautiful gift box with too little inside. It certainly isn't empty, but it's a lot less than you expected. Even by the time the blood starts to spill, you're not shocked, just tired. And we've seen it before. We know the drill. It just took an extra hour to get there this time around. Oh, and not only that, it was better the other times.The only reason to re-watch Hateful 8 is to count up all the plot holes. The set up is so contrived and Rube Goldberg it beggars belief, even by Tarantino's standards. ""But but but if you go back to those old exploitation flicks he's drawing from, they also had a myriad of implausible contrivances."" Well, that's true, so does that get him yet another pass? Maybe so, but it's really starting to feel less like a fresh take and more like a crutch.Hateful 8 is a 5/10 film that becomes a 6/10 or 7/10 depending on how much the acting and gorgeous visuals move you, but make no mistake, it's not a great film and it's one of Tarantino's weakest."
" TRASH
",0.0,0.7854,2020-12-05 00:00:00,1,"QT films a 'huis-clos' western in 70 mm. Go figure. A bunch a complete misfits find themselves together in a boarding house in the middle of nowhere and all hell ensues.Let me state alredy that I am NOT a QT fan. And this piece of junk only confirms my opinion. QT is totally obsessed with extreme violence so this is exactly what you get. There is nobody to sympathise with, definitely not the black bountyhunter, a former cavalry officer (did they have black officers during the civil war ?) and a sadistic racist if there ever was one. The rest of the cast consists also of complete morons. The worst fate is reserved for the only women, apparently a terrible outlaw who must hang. On top of that we are treated also to a long flashback in the middle of the movie which makes things even worse and is simply an excuse for some more mayhem against women. This movie takes misogeny to a new level.Has this piece of trash any redeeming features ? Not really but the 70 mm looks nice in the few moments we're outside. Hence my one point.As an antidote after this monstrosity I recommend you watch a few John Wayne westerns. It will do you good."
" No likable characters.

My stars go toward that the most. I just didn't care what happened to anybody. Once we were halfway through the story. Again, maybe that was the point. In that respect it succeeded. I felt it tiring mostly. That with such a melancholy ending. It was HATEFUL. For that it is a quality film for what it was meant to be I think. Not the most entertaining Tarantino film. One of the best directed and best looking films every made."

" Tarantino's Dimension
",0.0,0.9781,2020-11-27 00:00:00,7,"Just so we know I have enjoyed many of Quentin's earlier work. I think Quentin's greatest talent is directing and having a vision for what the and how the scene plays out. What's really lacking is the imagination in his screenwriting, which is what would make a the difference between a good movie and a great movie.As a director he is able to bring out he best qualities and abilities in his actors, such as Kurt Russell and Samuel Jackson, who both have made tons of movies and both have acted good and bad in their movies. Hateful Eight brings out their best thanks to Tarantino.The script is well thought out, too dramatic at times with ongoing over dramatization in exhausting monologues clearly a sign of someone who has too much to say all the time. Nevertheless the dialogue is impressive it works with the acting and fits into the scenes perfectly.So where did the movies go wrong... the story or the lack there of. From a bird's eye view much of the story reads a lot like Reservoir Dogs, where in both movies the story just takes place in one room, where there is a massive climatic shout out.The what if universe of Tarantino's mind takes us into the realm of unbelievability. Realistically Kurt Russell would have shot Jennifer the second he realized she was poisoned. After all he did threaten to shoot and kill her one too many times for doing a lot less.And had he not killed her Samuel Jackson would have shot her dead way before he started his lengthy interrogation. In fact he probably would have shot all three suspects without much hesitation. Since he knew so much about the inn keeper and how things were run.Walter would have probably killed Madsen right away since he did not believe him from the beginning, he most certainly would not ask or wait for permission from Samuel Jackson to kill him.It's really a shame to have such a well crafted movie in almost every aspect not to have a more solid, unique and original story and plot. My advise which I will give for free to Quentin is to be more open minded and too work with other gifted story writers."
" Good film
",0.4404,0.9743,2020-11-25 00:00:00,8,"I believe this was a solid film. I understand many put this as tarintinos worst film, but I completely disagree. I think tarintinos greatest feed shines in this movie. His ability to create suspense and a grabbing dialogue. The movie is slow paced, but at the same time it felt as I had to keep watching too see how everything unravels. Great cast, and great characters, and in my opinion, the coolest setting out of any tarintino movie. My one thing holding me back from rating this higher is the lack of soundtrack. I feel the movie could have been better if there were more shots off the mountains while traveling or something like that while containing music. This is as far from a professional review as it gets, but it's just my two cents."

Personally I enjoyed the story. A cabin in the middle of nowhere and a gathering of different people each with something to hide.The cast is great, for me the highlight was seeing Kurt Russell in it.There isn't really a great deal of substance in the movie.It's a Tarantino movie. Like him or not, he has his own style.Despite being set in the 1800's this isn't a western in the traditional sense, but it's also not too far from being one.Recommended for those looking for a blood fest action without needing much thought. To word it another way, a Tarantino movie."

" Expertly crafted and highly immersive
",0.0,0.9955,2020-11-17 00:00:00,9,"Once again, Tarantino proves just how brilliant of a director he is. Even though this movie is almost 3 hours long and mostly takes place in one room, there is not a single boring moment. The plot is seemingly very basic, but that allows Tarantino to take his story in any direction he wants, without making it messy. The pacing is great as well, but what really make this movie great are the characters and their conversations. Each and every character in this film has their own set of personality traits, and they all have a questionable moral compass. They all have stories to tell, and here lies the movies biggest strength in my opinion; The struggle of figuring out which stories are a lie, and which ones aren't. As a viewer, this creates a very captivating sense of not knowing where to place the characters. The performances also enhance the characters a lot, with basically every actor giving a fantastic performance. My favorites are probably Walton Goggins and Samuel L. Jackson, but you can make a case for almost everyone involved being the best actor in the movie. The climax is great, it's tensionfilled and almost poetic at times. Another thing this movie does expertly is utilizing its environments and locations. The vastness of the mountains, the claustrophobic feeling of the cabin, the freezing cold of the blizzard, it's all so immersive you almost feel the temperature change whenever someone goes outside or comes back inside. The score and sound design are also both fantastic, both adding to the uneasy feeling that something isn't right. My only issue with the movie is that the non-linear stuff isn't as well handled as in other Tarantino films, but that is a very minor complaint. Overall, this is an excellent, fun, deeply immersive experience that I definietly will watch again soon."

" An amazing crime, mystery, drama
",0.0772,0.9879,2020-11-11 00:00:00,9,"The hateful eight is another Quentin Tarantini film with great characters. I thought Quentin just made another western film with Samuel L. Jackson like Django, but it was delighted surprise when I found out that it was crime, drama, mystery after just watching Django.Samuel L. Jackson's character Major Marquis Warren is great as a war veteran bounty hunter, he isn't really a good guy but he has more of a villian personality but you still route for him because the real villian Daisy Domergue, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh gives off the vibe that makes every scene unsettling and tense. There is always a reason for her to be alive, starting with Kurt Russel's character John Ruth's code. Walter Coggins is great in this film as Sheriff Chris Mannix who is from the south and is the new sheriff of the town the main cast of characters is trying to get to. Overall this movie is amazing for a film that is 3 hours long. It has amazing characters, a great setting, and an amazing plot."
" Excellent performances with a sharp screenplay
",0.5719,0.9986,2020-11-08 00:00:00,8,"Quentin Tarantino has delivered a lot of solid films over his career and The Hateful is a part of that.The Hateful Eight follows eight characters that are stuck in a cabin during a blizzard and they're all suspicious of one another.I really enjoyed watching this film. I do have to admit it's a bit too long and some scenes do drag but I was consistently riveted from start to finish. This film was meant to be a stageplay and it does feel like that. Majority of the film takes place in one single location and it's hard to keep someone's interest for 2 hours and 40 minutes if it happens mainly in one location but Tarantino managed to do it. There are so many scenes where characters just talk to each other but Tarantino makes it so engaging because of the spectacular dialogue and performances on screen. There is one scene where Samuel L. Jackson delivers a lengthy monologue and it's one of the most captivating and intense scenes in the movie. The third act gets super entertaining as it goes full Tarantino.Despite being in one location most of the time, this is a really gorgeous looking film. The outside cinematography looks so beautiful and I really felt the icy cold weather portrayed. I wish I saw this on the big screen as the experience would be elevated so much more. It's shot really well and the costumes and makeup is excellent. One issue I have with the third act is the use of narration. Tarantino has used a fair amount of narration in his previous films and The Hateful Eight is no different but I don't think it was properly utilised. It's a storytelling choice that Tarantino hasn't been able to master yet.The well written dialogue kept me hooked but it was also the performances that kept me invested. This is Samuel L. Jackson's best performance in recent years. He delivers dialogues extremely eloquently and is so fun to watch. Kurt Russell and Bruce Dern are also really good. This is the best I've seen Jennifer Jason Leigh in a film. She was awesome. It was great to see Tim Roth and Michael Madsen in a Tarantino movie after a long time. DemiÃ¡n Bichir was really good and Walton Goggins was another standout performer.The Hateful Eight is by no means Quentin Tarantino's best work. It's more towards the weaker side of his filmography but I loved it regardless. The sharp dialogue, phenomenal performances and gorgeous scenery made it an extremely fun experience."

4. The film is unpredictable except the ending.
What's bad:
1. Like all Quentin Tarantino films, this one also has violence and profanity. So it can't be watched with family.
2. The film takes time to set up. But after an hour, the film picks up and entertains till the end.
3. I always felt Quentin Tarantino shows poetic justice in his movies. The ending is the proof of it and is predictable.

" Just never got going.
",0.0,0.9891,2020-09-21 00:00:00,2,"I appreciate a slow moving film. It starts off with beautiful imagery of a stagecoach driving through the snow, and a score by Ennio Merricone. I was pumped for a great movie. Maybe I simply over expected. The movie has great characters, great actors, and great dialogue, but Tarrantino spends waaaay too much time showing that off than getting into the meat of the story. I thought that the slow methodical start to the film would start to pick up some steam when we finally met all the characters, but it didn't. This was a great opportunity wasted. Kurt Russel, Walton Goggins, Samuel Jackson, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, all in the same movie and it was just simply dull. With that cast, it should have been explosive. It seemed like there was more thought into how many times they could throw in the 'N' word, than in the story itself.Now, this was the extended cut, so maybe the other version moves better, but I somehow doubt it.To be fair, I didn't stick around until the end, so it may have been fantastic in the second half, but I had watched half the film and felt like I only got about fifteen minutes worth of story. It's rare that I leave a movie without at least seeing how it turns out, but it just didn't give me enough reasons for doing so.With that said, watch the movie to see if it your cup of tea and judge for yourself. I know there are people who love it, so maybe that will describe you."
" A Slower Tarantino Film
",0.0,0.9414,2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,"This movie was sandwiched inbetween Django Unchained and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and while I don't find it as enjoyable as those two, this still holds up. It's one of Tarantino's slower movies, but the mixing personalities of all the characters, Robert Richardson's cinematography, and Ennio Morricone's score made this a great movie. Oh man, that theme song has become an earworm in my head. Haunting and entrancing at the same time. A friend of mine pointed out the copious amounts of blood and gore we've come to associate with Quentin Tarantino's films. I also love that this movie was basically lead by older actors. Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walton Goggins were all over the age of 40 when they made this. Shows that even if you're old, you can still carry a film. Finally, I know this is around the Post-Civil War/Reconstruction era of American history, but there's an uncomfortable amount of N word bombs in this movie."
" Tarantino Fun
",0.5106,0.995,2020-09-07 00:00:00,9,"Note: this review is based on the Extended Version of the film, which was released on Netflix in 2019 as a four-part miniseries. Altogether, with episode credits and recaps taken out of the equation, this version includes about twenty minutes of additional footage compared to the original theatrical release.""The Hateful Eight"" will not go down as one of Tarantino's more groundbreaking films. But it has to be applauded for its mastery of character dialogue. The first two and a half hours of this movie are just incredible to me. What really lets it down is the final hour or so.John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is a bounty hunter transporting Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the town of Red Rock, where Ruth will receive a reward of $10,000 and Daisy will be hanged. Along the way, they come across Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a fellow bounty hunter who fought as a Major for the Union during the Civil War. The group make their way to Minnie's Haberdashery, where they hope to wait out a blizzard. They interact with an assortment of colorful characters, each with their own shroud of mystery surrounding them and their own expressed reasonings behind their stays at the Haberdashery.The character dialogue and writing really make this movie so enjoyable. Tarantino has a great way of writing characters that are intriguing and who feel like they have depth to them. The star-studded cast light up the screen and play out their characters really well. The majority of the movie takes place in the crowded Haberdashery, and it really feels like a story that also could have been told well on the stage of a theatre. I was at first hesitant about this one, seeing as how Tarantino had just done a western with ""Django: Unchained"", but this one is not like ""Django"" at all. The previous film was a revenge story and a spaghetti western, but ""The Hateful Eight"" plays out more like an old ""who-dun-it"" story that just happens to be set in the old west. The cinematography is excellent here, as is the old-school aesthetic, complete with chapter titles and an intermission. Ennio Morricone, most famous for his score for ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" does a terrific job with the movie's soundtrack. Again, while not as good as some of his previous work, I think that he was much deserving, finally, of his first Oscar win.The real let-down with this movie, for me, is really the ending. I won't spoil anything, but I really didn't like the violent eruption of things or the extended flashback that spent way too much time telling us things that weren't really necessary for the overall plot. I guess it's not really an objective criticism of the film, but the ending took turns that kind of left me scratching my head. It's not necessarily a bad thing, objectively speaking, but it really felt unsatisfying, and it also felt like a lot of the plot twists were really forced and only included for shock and not because they would have added a whole lot to the overall story.I think that it's a great movie, but it's flawed in its execution of its finale. It definitely comes as a recommended watch for further discussion of its ending. It's a good piece of entertainment, well acted, and well produced. When compared to other Tarantino films, I don't think that it will be as fondly remembered as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", or ""Inglorious Basterds."" Some will criticize it and call it boring for taking place mostly within one room. I personally feel that the problems lie more with the story itself and where Tarantino leads us. Movie fans will like this movie, fans of Tarantino and fans of character driven films will love it."
" Extended Edition is a bit better! Overall, a grower and overlooked.
",0.4753,-0.1401,2020-08-29 00:00:00,9,"I went into this movie expecting a crazy thrillride with a bunch of Tarantino greats, and action packed shootouts. This is not that. This is a well paced arthouse movie, like Reservoir Dogs, or Dusk Till Dawn, or any good stage play, focused mainly on the dialogue/story telling and spurts of violence and surprises. If you like really dark comedy/gallow humor, you may love this movie, that was its best feature.This truly went from being my least favorite Tarantino movie, to one of my favorite movies after a rewatch recently. Especially the extended edition...which I have no idea why they cut some of these lines out, they are hilarious, catch this version if you can, it is a must. Same with the added scenes and flashback playout felt too add a lot to the feel of the movie.Yes, it did seem to drag a bit at the 3rd chapter, since we knew the twist at this point, but it was still cool to see, just didn't need to take so much time off. The violence was fine to me, it was riffing off The Thing and old brutal westerns (also Carrie?) which felt pretty obvious to me, but the violence on women was definitely hard to see (which had a purpose behind it)Basically, don't go in expecting Inglorious Basterds or Kill Bill, it's an artpiece of itself, going for something totally different for Tarantino, which is refreshing in retrospect. Think of the Coen Brothers doing True Grit. It's just a change in pace and you may appreciate it more with an open mindset."

",0.0,-0.9341,2020-08-28 00:00:00,8,"This film is quite long at the beginning when it sets up all the characters and the overall scenario but it never feels slow. This is due to the very paranoid and violent personalities of the characters which creates constant tension. We know that something is wrong with the situation but we don't know how it will progress. The actors who portray these characters all inject them with strong personalities so there is a lot of drama from how they clash with each other. There is a constant flow of action, paranoia and revelations of backstories that culminates in a crescendo of violence, perhaps a bit much for me."

" Quinton Tarantino's Most Underrated Film
",0.0,-0.9324,2020-08-24 00:00:00,9,"I never saw this film back when it was released in 2015. But, I did manage to buy a copy of Blu-Ray. Now, when I first saw it, I thought this movie was flawless/perfect. I now know that no movie despite what anyone may say, is perfect. But I am firm believer that this is in fact Quinton Tarantino's most underrated and under-appreciated film. Everyone I've talked to, says the Hateful Eight isn't Tarantino's most re-watchable film. I disagree. With a phenomenal cast that really gets into their characters. Each one stands out and not one is forgetful. Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell are the stars of this film and it shows. Their performances (in my opinion) were Oscar worthy. Don't even get me started on the story. This is basically a Who-Done-It play turned into a film. The complexity of this story should make the audience feel confused and turn their heads going, ""what the hell is happening?"". But it does the exact opposite. Everything flows perfectly. The pacing of this film, while it is almost 3 hours, it doesn't feel like it. The cinematography is great. The score brings tension and makes the audience uneasy. But I think my favorite thing of this film, is the scenery. Having these 8 characters who all hate each other, trapped by a blizzard. Really builds up the tension of the catastrophe that is coming. The only thing that is working against this film is the lengthy setup shots at the beginning of the movie. The first five minutes of the film is plagued by it and those tend to drag on. Beyond that, everything about this film is great."

He indulges himself in all kinds of dark desires, and he must tickle the audiences the right way, because they join in for the ride. Mind you, the ride has to be peppered with some dark humour and witty subplots, to keep the audience entertained. In this movie, the wit and the humour are nowhere to be seen, though. Now, there is an intriguing tale reminiscent of Agatha Christie here, and there is the obligatory violence, but at the end of the day, it just wasn't fun to watch. Also, the film plays upon nasty exploitation of racial tensions. It even goes so far as to pretend it gives a damn about anything. But we know Tarantino is too cynical for that, and too disinterested in history to even try and comprehend what the Civil War was about. Everything he does is exploitation. And it can work, but only If it is as seductively fun as Pulp Fiction. This time around, the fun part was lacking."

Amazing performances by all, and the twisting and turning plot will keep you guessing right up to the conclusion.

The cinematography is breathtaking. This is really, one of Quentin Tarantino's most beautiful movies. The score is also very good. Is this movie as good as pulp fiction? No, but it's damm close. I still can't believe, that this movie, is three hours long. There is almost not One single dull moment, in this movie, and I am talking about a movie, with eight people, talking in a little house. Quentin Tarantino you did it again."
" The fastest slow movie I've ever seen.
",0.0,0.9194,2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,"The Hateful Eight is a fantastic movie worthy of at least two or three times of watching. It is slow, yes, but the essence of this movie can be harvested from it's dialogue alone. More specifically this is notable in the extended version, where they pretty much play out every scene to it's logical conclusion. Leaving us with no querry about where these people stand and what they think. The movie skips over the ends of several conversations and the extended version just addendums that. Which I believe makes it the definitive version.The pacing while slow, I'd argue is perfect. You open with some gorgeous shots of snowy mountains, and you're stuck looking at it for what feels like ten minutes and you start to get tired of it. You start to feel as the characters do, that the snowy world out there is an inhospitable wasteland thanks to the blizzard. You meet characters who have done despicable things, and are simply going about their business on this mountain. At first you want to find someone to like, but soon you'll realize the only likable person is Obe. But no less, these despicable characters must interact due to the circumstances and the paranoia they feel seeps into your bones as you listen to them talk. The paranoia and suspicion ebbs and flows, and you don't know who you can trust. Until the action starts. Then it's a fast paced ride to hell.Now it's at this point where the lower review scores are the people who simply walked away. A frozen wasteland, hateful paranoid characters, no one wants to be there, and there hasn't been a gunshot every five minutes like other Terantino films. I can understand why the movie isn't for them. But if you like dialogue and suspense, you'll love this movie. It has commentary on the racism of the times, and the nature of lawful justice vs righteous justice.Tl;dr - it's no action western, but rather a slow paranoid descent into the depths of a lost time viewed from a different angle.Highly recommend watching it a second time to see the little hints and things dropped along the way, and the way characters react when you know the truth."

Yes the start might be slow (yet charming in terms of dialogue and wit), but once you enter chapter three territory, it is pretty much all go from there!
Once again Tarantino puts his stamp on cinema with culturally appropriate dialogue and a serving of exaggerated gore/violence, which I have to expect and is my main reason for being in the cinema for each of his films.
This isn't for everyone, but if you want to play guess who and have a few twists and turns thrown your way, well then come aboard the coach! It had me on edge and feeling slightly uncomfortable throughout, due to the vile language of the time and the tension that builds up between characters."

I lost the respect right immediately after that. And then half of the time has passed, and still nothing concrete happens in the film. Damn, i am already half way through 1hr 30mins gone, and nothing happens? Just the actors are wasting my time so far?? Ridiculous, 1hr 30mins is good enough to complete one fine thriller film.

" Oh so long
",0.0,-0.9918,2020-06-30 00:00:00,4,"Having watched two Tarantino films back to back, I may have burnt myself out on this genre. Perhaps my lack of excitement at the events was due to the blurring together of the two movies, which reduced the sensationalism of the plot, but there is no way to know. For a movie with such graphic bloodshed and exciting backstories, not much seemed to happen. There was no protagonist, per se, and all of the characters were unsavory, making their inevitable deaths feel justified and moral. What saved the film from feeling interminable was the flashback. Going back in time to show how the situation came to be broke up the monotony of men standing around shouting. However, the stakes did not feel real to me. The threat level was so high and critically dangerous that it capped out and became mundane. If everything is violent and aggressively sinister, it doesn't feel special anymore and loses its sensationalism. One scene, in particular, felt forced and unnecessary: Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) informs General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) that he had tortured, taken advantage of s*xually, and then killed the Generals son. It was graphic, and shocking, which was the intention, but lacked any sort of reason why the audience should care. There was no established reason why this event would spark a deep emotional reaction, beyond basic human decency."

However, The Hateful Eight was a little too slow, very talky compared to his others, maybe more than Death Proof, and did not deserve the almost 3 hour length. the score is also really good and fits the movie's theme. In terms of the plot, I like the idea, being stuck at a cabin during a blizzard, classic idea, but you gotta have something going on to make it interesting, rather than just them chit-chatting, but when the movie does get into more entertaining/actiony parts, it gets WEIRD, like the vomiting blood scene. I also had no clue what the point of the movie was until almost the end, and even then, I had to also look it up online. Compared to his other films though, this is nowhere near as good as his others, it would definitely benefit being cut down and maybe restructured."
" A Western-Mystery through Tarantino's unique sensibility
",0.0,-0.0804,2020-06-17 00:00:00,7,"That Hateful Eight strikes me as fundamentally a gritty, '60s-style western with mystery elements, a lot of conversation, and a fair amount of nastiness.For maybe the first two-thirds, H8 is a talky Western populated by intriguing but unlikable people. There is clearly something going on beneath the service, but it's unclear what, or which characters might not be what they seem. Some here call this a murder mystery, which is wrong, or at least only right to the extent that you could describe this as a ""period drama."" You could call it that, and I could see why you would, but it's still ultimately wrong.The cast is excellent, particularly Samuel L. Jackson as a tough bounty hunter and Jennifer Jason Leigh (giving her best performance in years) as a decidedly ornery criminal.There is a lot of talking in this movie, and while it's generally interesting there's probably too much of it. Still, while the movie's pace is a bit slow, it never flags.The last part contains the brutality Tarantino is so enamored of. It's both gory and emotionally disturbing, which I guess is what people want from his films, or, at least, what he wants to give them, most of the time.I've never cared for hyper violence, I'm not generally into Westerns, and Tarantino is a director I sometimes like but have yet to love. With all that said, the movie of the first two-thirds I would probably give an 8 but the increasing unpleasantness often felt both a bit gratuitous and, more importantly, not entirely in keeping with most of the movie. It's as thought Tarantino was torn between wanting to create a character study and wanting to create a Tarantino gore fest and finally decided to just go ahead and do them both.Overall, I'd recommend this if you can deal with the gore and unpleasantness, because it is well written, directed, and acted."

",-0.3612,-0.3498,2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie entertaining. It is a violent Agatha Christie story set in a wester, which I find an original idea. Good acting, good directing and as usual the dialog keeps you in suspend that builds up until it explode into a violent outrage.
I am not going to tell much more, watch it and make an opinion for yourself.
Ps. Try to look beyond the over the top bloody scenes (that don't get me wrong, are very entertaining if you like violent movies and are familiar with Tarantino's films) because there is a message."

" The Hateful Eight
",-0.4939,0.6997,2020-05-30 00:00:00,7,"The soundtrack has new attempts than before, using the music made by the characters in the film as the soundtrack, such as women's guitar playing.
The lines are highly interactive, and all kinds of foreshadowing. Although the words are tuberculosis, each line is valuable.
The image of the cross sculpture at the beginning is a very good foreshadowing. And it is pushing away slowly, revealing the whole a little bit, and there is also a little suspense.
At this stage, Quentin's film obviously added elements of historical events. The background of this film is the American Civil War. It also reflects his discussion of human nature in a special historical context. It's a pity that it still doesn't go deep. This film did not give me any surprise."
" Enjoyable, except for one glaring plot hole
",0.4404,0.749,2020-05-28 00:00:00,7,"I genuinely enjoyed this Tarantino movie, as I have for all that I've seen of his. As usual, the cast was great. Samuel L Jackson and Kurt Russell were exceptional, and you have the solid performances from Tarantino mainstays such as Walton Goggins, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen. Let me give a quick shout out to Jennifer Jason Leigh as well for her performance of the despicable fugitive, Daisy Domergue. This movie has all the trademarks of Tarantino film as well: overly wordy, drawn out, slow build up, plot twists and provocative use of the ""n"" word. It checks all the boxes. But, this one has one big problem.I loved the first 2 hours of the film, as I'm kind of a sucker for a well done 'who dunnit'. I enjoyed the characters, the dialogue, and the build up. The problem is the last 40 minutes or so, starting with the moment the coffee is poisoned. After O.B. and John Ruth died from the poisoning, there were just 2 guys left from that group, Major Maruquis Warren and Chris Mannix. There was still all of the original party there that were there to free Domergue, plus the guy in the crawl space. Now, when Major Warren lined up the other three along the wall to figure out what happened, why didn't the guy in the crawl space just shoot Major Warren right then, instead of letting him arm Mannix, and then ultimately kill 'Bob'? Think about it. It would have been now 4 against 1, and Mannix was unarmed. The other 3 had weapons stashed around the haberdashery, so they definitely had the advantage.Even without this obvious plot hole, the last 40 minutes just don't measure up to the first 2 hours. I get the feeling that Tarantino never fully developed the right way to finish the story. Now, I also understand that killing Major Warren right away would basically end the movie, but I can argue that the movie was already 2 hours in, and maybe the right ending would be having the bad guys win. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if that was the way it went, but alas, it didn't.One other issue I have with this movie is that it seems like everybody somehow knows each other. John 'the Hangman' Ruth recognizes Major Warren in the middle of nowhere. Then shortly later, he recognizes Chris Mannix. Then Mannix recognizes Warren. Keep in mind, this is all happening on a Wyoming trail, during a blizzard in a country and time that was much bigger than it is today. Then, at the haberdashery, Mannix recognizes General Smithers. Shortly later, Major Warren recognizes the General as well. It just came across as way too much of a coincidence that people from faraway somehow all know each other. It might make for some interesting dialogue, but it's a flaw with this film.All in all, I did enjoy it. I just think there was a much better conclusion available than the one we got."

For the reward is there if you have enough patience: the cinematography, the acting, the dialogues, the music. All is perfect in Quentin's movies and so it was here: there were even enough plot twists that got me jumping, or at least moving around on my seat a bit more.

",0.344,0.9909,2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"QT's second pure western is based in the 1870s, during a deathly cold winter in Wyoming. A bounty hunter (Kurt Russell), his captive (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two other strangers (Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins) seek refuge in Minnie's haberdashery, a quaint cabin in the middle of nowhere. There they are joined by four other strangers seeking refuge and then begins a tense game of survival until the blizzard outside stops. As suggested by the title, the film is full of not very nice characters and Tarantino proves yet again he is the master of twisted enjoyment when it comes to their punishments, particularly Jason Leigh who goes through the wringer a lot! The clever thing about it all is that there's a massive enjoyment to be had in the company of these wicked people, all thanks to a stunning ensemble cast and a spectacular script. As well as being an engaging western thriller, a genuinely great comedy too with incredible dark humour throughout; everyone concocts a deliciously evil potion to quench your comic thirst! 'Christmas with mother.... is a wonderful thing.' A great line delivered with brooding intensity by Michael Madsen's Joe Gage! Samuel L Jackson's performance is just amazing; of course a legendary actor getting to work his dramatic and comic talent to its full here. The whole sequence of him taunting Bruce Dern's General Smithers is really something to behold. The music which showcases a gorgeous original score by Western legend Ennio Morricone is wonderful. Overall, I believe it's a divisive one in Quentins catalogue as it is his longest running and slowest to date, having no fear in taking its time on the small details.

" Lesser work from a great director

As a Tarantino movie it's three hours long.The movie also attempts to be a mystery, and being this unwound is fatal to it. Mysteries need to be taut, so you pay attention. There were times during ""The Hateful Eight"" where I stopped watching.I'll never know what happened to Tarantino's ability to write good dialogue. ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were nothing but quotable lines. Where were the quotable lines in any of the movies he has made since? How many lines can you remember from them, if any at all?Tarantino made a great movie with ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", and an absolutely appalling one with ""Death Proof"". ""The Hateful Eight"" is like the bridge between the two. It may not have memorable dialogue or characters, but at least they don't prattle on about god-knows-what for an hour before getting killed, only to introduce a bunch more vacuous motor-mouths who do the same thing.It's still very well made, well acted, and feels like a lesser work from a great director."

Well made without a doubt, five star craftspeople coming together from every corner of film-making. But, as a dispassionate viewer, its tempting to wonder just if The Emperor Has A New Movie...
Worth a watch... Wouldn't be asking at the box office for my money back on the way out... But a bit more left on the cutting room floor wouldn't have hurt the end result.

",0.6369,0.8027,2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,"If you didn't liked this movie and yet you call yourself a Tarantino fan something is wrong with you because this movie sums up his entire style: outstanding writing with great storytelling, social critics and dialogues that make you think, great direction skills with beautiful plans and angles, and of course the classic Tarantino violent side.Not everyone has the ability of making an entire movie in just one place and still have you glued on the screen the entire time, this one really shows how an exceptional writer he is. Today I rewatched it and I noticed the mention to Red Apple Tobacco that is also mentioned in his latest movie, just showing how much effort he puts in his writing and that he wants to connect his movies by some way.If it bothers you the cursing, racism and violence in this movie maybe you should just go and watch Disney productions because without all of those aspects this wouldn't have portrayed the reality of that time as faithful as it did. Tarantino is never afraid of portraying reality as it is and that's why I said that this is not for everyone because a lot of people can't deal with reality. And let's not forget that all of those things and the purpose to make various social critics. This movie isn't underrated because it's bad but because of the sensibility of people.
Now the last chapter events surely aren't for the weakest ones but it's just classic Tarantino kicking in!"

" So in the end, who poisoned the coffee?
",-0.4939,-0.9915,2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"A movie full of men, but the biggest attraction is feminism
Quentin once said that at least three Western films have to be made before he can barely be regarded as a Western director. The Eight Wicks movie is the second western film he directed. Audiences familiar with Quentin will know that he has always been obsessed with filming films, from the debut film Falling Dogs to the recent Hollywood past.But what is different from Quentin's other works is that the Eight Evils used 70mm film for extravagant shooting, which made the movie's aspect ratio reach an astonishing 2.76: 1. Such large frames are often used to shoot large scenes in epic films, such as film star Nolan's interstellar crossing and Dunkirk after that.Using 70mm film to shoot a movie that is indoors 80% of the time is undoubtedly an arrogant act. In this regard, Quentin's explanation is that only viewers using 70mm film technology can experience the charming snow scene of Wyoming.In fact, I understand here, why the eight wicked people will start with a four-minute fixed lens, of course, to see the snow scene. The story of the Eight Evils occurred after the American Civil War, when the social order was on the verge of collapse, and the government needed to rely on the bounty hunter 's gun to maintain social stabilityRuth is a bounty hunter. He encountered a blizzard on the way back to the city in exchange for a bounty, so he could only avoid it in the middle, which is the men's clothing store in Minnesota. Outside the house is a borderless white desert and ultra-low temperature, and the passengers in the house are forced to live together in a room, and the contradictions are triggered in the narrow small space.Speaking of the 77mm film camera, although it is too small to use for indoor shooting, the effect of smashing the money can still be seen. The entire picture is larger and the scenes of the characters that can be installed are more. The suspense contained The details are of course more abundant.I have to say that it 's good to have moneyIn addition, the film The Eight Evils is a very expressive film, which is full of dialogues (broken mouths) and speech-style tables. Eighty percent of them are indoor dramas, which is obvious It's a very boring movie, but in Quentin's hands, it was tricked.Wars, laws, racial discrimination, and women 's rights are all included in the movie. Quentin in the play, like the legal war, has actually spoken through the character's mouth. So today we mainly talk about racial discrimination and feminism. As far as racial discrimination is concerned, the movie actually makes it very clear. After all, the background time was after the Civil War. Although the new American society had already emerged at that time, the old ideas were far from melting, and discrimination against black people was still everywhere.Maguire was a black federal soldier during the Civil War. He survived the Civil War, and he has the ability and wisdom beyond ordinary people. This is shown in the film, and I will not spoil it here, but even such a powerful black warrior, in order to reduce the vigilance of the white man against himself, actually forged a Lincoln letter. It can be seen how serious the problem of racial discrimination was.When it comes to feminism, I have seen similar reviews on the Internet. The view of that article is that this movie is not related to feminism. It is said that feminism is over-interpreted. I don't agree with this view, because in my opinion, the feminist taste of this movie is actually very heavy. As far as the characters are concerned, the female prisoner Daisy is actually a very powerful gangster. But in the whole film, it is the most vulnerable character. Whether it was suppressed by Rus before, or after being suppressed by Maguire and Chris, she did not really have the opportunity to show her ability. She was either handcuffed or pointed by a gun. Whenever she wanted to ""bloom"", she would be suppressed by men.Whether it is Ruth 's violence against her or the woman 's innocence after Chris, they are actually reflecting the true attitude of these men towards women, even before them is a gang leader with a government reward of $ 10,000. The only time Daisy bloomed with herself was the part where she played the guitar, and it was also the most tense part of the movie. From the perspective of the audience, Daisy is an indiscriminate criminal, and Ruth is undoubtedly a spokesperson for justice or government.On the guitar and singing, the audience was nervous as they watched the cup of poisonous coffee in Ruth's hands. The easiest time for Daisy was the time when Russ was going to die. The poison coffee had been brewed and he was waiting to drink it.In the melodious guitar song, Daisy's small eyes kept peeking, which made the audience's hearts catch up. This is my favorite part of the whole film, but the fact is not what Daisy imagined. Although Russ died, Maguire pressed it up, even though Maguire 's gun was gone without a bullet. Chris fainted , Daisy desperately wanted to get the pistol, but was stopped by Chris at the last minute.Although Daisy should have strong strength, as can be seen from the government's 10,000 bounty, a powerful woman is suppressed by men again and again. If it is not mapping feminism, what is it expressing?When it comes to the guitar section, I have to talk about the guitar itself. The broken guitar in the play is actually a cultural relic. This guitar has a history of 150 years. The museum lent it to Kun to support the film business. Ting. The actor who dropped the guitar, Kurt Russell, was not informed in advance that it was a cultural relic, but Jennifer Jason Lee, who is good at playing the guitar, knew the true identity of the guitar.A female prisoner who didn't blink, but yelled at the moment when the guitar was dropped. In fact, this performance does not match the role. This guitar is more like a redundant sacrifice. Many fans justify itThis is the ruffian Quentin himselfQuentin is to inspire the actors to perform betterQuentin is also for the audienceBut fellow, he knew it was a cultural relic, and the museum did not authorize him to fallBut he fell and did not tell the actor the truth in advanceThis is not washable anywayAlthough in the end Quentin also paid for his actions, the reason why cultural relics are not sold in the window like commodities is because their meaning is far more than their value, such behavior is bad in any case. of.But one yard to one yard, the movies he made are indeed quite good, worthy of his name as a ghost.This movie recommends everyone to watch it, it is a very good western film. Whether it's the scene or the character's clothing, you can feel that turbulent cowboy era, and in all the western films, this eight villains can definitely be called a big coffee gathering, and can even be compared with the Avengers series of Marvel Universe. Comparable, it is simply a competition of the acting school.The only bad thing is the length of its movie. The eight villains are divided into four parts. The total length of the movie reaches 183 minutes. Coupled with the Quentin-style broken mouth dialogue, people who are impatient may not wait for the movie to climax Quickly exit. So I suggest that you make preparations for watching movies in advance, this is definitely a movie worth watching.So in the end, who poisoned the coffee?"

" Good movie but story not
",0.2382,-0.9924,2020-04-01 00:00:00,5,"As it might be surprising I've just watched the movie, and did it twice.At first I was captured by actors play, views, and scenes, so I decided to watch it again... and may be that was a mistake, which lead to writing this review. The thing I never done before, but sometimes one just can't help.This highly priced bandits on the second thought (watch) turned out to be a group which has difficulties with putting their act together.They had so many chances to kill John Ruth, starting with him entering inside and trying to fix the door. He was standing with his back to them with a hammer in his hand. What a better moment you need to shoot him? OK. There are two more guys out there but odds are on their side. So why these killers hesitated? Apparently they like to pretend being somebody else, and not finish the story too quick...All right. They didn't use the first chance, and were disarmed by Ruth and Major Warren. But they had plenty of guns hidden out so why not to get them and shoot both while they don't expect it? Again they probably don't want the story to be too simple. Or they just plain stupid.And just to confirm their stupidity they decided to poison the coffee. OK. Ruth made it, so what? Is there any guarantee that he will drink it and die first? What if somebody else goes before him? Wouldn't it be a bit suspicious for his already suspicious mind? And they knew that he is suspicious, also they knew that Major Warren is on his side. Even if Ruth was poisoned Major would not just sit and continue to drink his brandy. Obviously he would do something about it. As just happened in the movie... But again why not get yourself armed, at least as a precaution?Next, I might be completely wrong here but just expressing a doubt. I'm not sure that two bullets at that time could blow up the head as it happened with misfortunate senior Bob. Maybe they could... But before he was shot twice in the chest from the same two guns, and from that I assume with the bullets of the same power. In that case his chest should become one big hole, but it didn't. And this is kind of sort of strange...And at last... Jody's sitting in the basement. He's got his moment, he wounded Major. So why on earth he stopped shooting? Did he believe it was enough? Then why he kept on sitting in that basement? What a best moment to come out. Major is laying crying, Mannix is busy with other guys. Most likely they didn't pay attention where the basement hatch is. So if Jody jumped out quickly, he would have at least a second or more than his enemies and he knew where they are. Since no man in this movie ever missed (not even touch that!), it would be enough for him to kill both of them. I think if he's such a thug as we are made to believe ($25k for his head), and eager to kill whoever is crossing his sister way to the freedom, he would do that... Instead he's just decided to peacefully stay in his comfort zone, I mean, basement, gave up his guns upon request, came out with his hands held high, and allowed his head to be blown up. All that to let us see, how two dying men are hanging Daisy, all covered in blood. It was certainly worth blowing up Jody's head for that.Thanks anyone who managed to read this through."

Whenever things start to get boring new information is revealed to us. It forces the audience to engage with us in the story, when we find out the coffee was poisoned it engaged the audience with the story, we have to make are own decisions about whats really happening. All in all amazing film."

",0.0,0.9455,2020-03-15 00:00:00,9,"People might find this boring, but for me it's with tarantino's best. it slowly burns, it gives you time to think about it, it gives you hints and mostly its a social commentary, if america present and past would fit in that saloon. All the actors are well on point and i didn't find it boring at all. It's like if a ""normal"" tarantino movie is a bit more extended on a whodunnit basis, but prety redeeming at the end. I also loved how he wanted to tell this story, and you have to wach it think also about a theatrical play. This is the most theatrical tarantino film, it could easily be a play.But what i indeed liked the most was the different characters the movie had. One general, one black guy - both fought on different sides of the war, one hispanic, someone from england that tried to pacify everything, even though all of them aren't exactly what they seem to be. but at the end of the day it's america that finds and condemns the guilty, sacrificing itself for the sake of justice. i think there's somehow hope on all the cultural clashes this film shows. Tarantino wanted to film america and i think he did it. Plus is pretty entertaining even if the scenery is pretty much the same. And it's pure tarantinesque, no one could have made this like tarantino did. If inglorious basterds was tarantino's version of hitler's death, django his version of slavery, this is his version of america, and who lives and lived there.I believe a lot of people won't enjoy it if they're expecting a more fast paced film with bloody moments. this isn't fast paced but for me it even make it more enjoyable when the blood finally arrived. Because on a sudden you weren't expecting it. It's like the first scene of inglorious basterds takes way longer than 15 minutes. It's hans landa talking for hours until he realizes what's going on inside that house - but in this case we're talking about america united aginst the bad guys.i really thought it's one of tarantino's best. along kill bill and pulp fiction in my opinion."

" Enjoyable Eighth from Tarantino
",0.4404,0.9776,2020-03-01 00:00:00,8,"'The Hateful Eight' seems to be a film that reflects it's auteur writer-director perfectly. His animating interests in life and film and the art form of film composition.Storytelling and it's elegant unrealness seems to preoccupy Tarantino here and he has produced a feature where narrative build and release via a seriously plotted script is the point in of itself rather than a means to display the intent of the story.I think that 'The Hateful Eight' almost makes this work for Tarantino but not necessarily for his audience.The cast realise, as far as I am concerned, that they are pawns in the experience of tale telling and give very ""scripted"" performances: what's on the page is what ends up on the screen from every actor.The wonderful photography confirms Tarantino as an explorer in his own creation of visual narrative fantasy.There is a long time allowed for the real complex of violence and physical discord to unleash out of the carefully orchestrated plot lines which with hindsight prefigures Tarantino's next film 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'.I prefer this film a great deal over it's successor however and I rate an 8/10 and recommend it to fans of layered narrative form in cinema and to fans of Samuel L Jackson! Other positives include a typical virtuosity of character actors in supporting roles and musical score from the eminent Morricone."

However the film is slow and honestly there were scenes in which I had a bit of a hard time keeping up, but from the moment the it starts to happen, the film is so much more fun that there are scenes where I started laughing of stupidity and blood, as well as other aspects such as Photography and Music in the film are phenomenal, as are the performances mainly by Samuel L Jackson, Jennifer Lason Leigh and Walton Goggins."
" In a Hateful World, Tarantino's Intimate Western Epic Shows the Unifying Power of Violence.
",-0.8074,0.9752,2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"For a filmmaker known for homage, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight functions less like a love letter to a forgotten Hollywood genre than a sincere example of one. It doesn't imitate the classic westerns, it is one. Shot on honest to goodness 70mm film and scored by Ennio Morricone himself, The Hateful Eight plays like a relic unearthed from Hollywood's now ancient past. Its sumptuous technical quality, paired with another sizzling Tarantino script, makes The Hateful Eight a shining beacon in a movie landscape starving for quality, grown up entertainment. It's a big bad mother******, and it's one of the best films of the year.Most of The Hateful Eight takes place in a single cabin. That intimate plot is one of the things that keeps The Hateful Eight feeling distinct from its inspirations. Tarantino turns the film into an Agatha Christie style chamber piece, set against a massive blizzard, where eight mysterious figures work out secrets, lies, and personal vendettas. You can't very well describe The Hateful Eight as a spaghetti western or even a tribute to the spaghetti western because its structure is completely new. Tarantino's script indulges his best impulses. The movie is almost entirely dialogue punctuated by extreme violence. The tense conversations wherein characters play subtle power games with one another in order to uncover secret motives is a staple of the best of Tarantino's writing, and he lets that urge run wild here. The movie is long, nearly three hours, but Tarantino never reaches a creative plateau. The story twists into pretzels, constantly surprising and delighting with new wrinkles. It only gets more complicated, more suspenseful, and more thrilling as it moves towards its resolution.All eight of the principle actors are in fine form, so much so that I have trouble singling any one of them out of the bunch. Samuel L. Jackson is as charismatic as he's been in years, Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins exude real joy in their roles, and others like Tim Roth, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, and Demian Bichir are textured and complicated. But if I had to pick a standout performance, it would be from Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue, the most vile, nasty woman in film history. It's some kind of brilliant performance, a snarling, sarcastic psychopath who takes repeated punishment only to return the favor in increasingly evil ways. She is the lightning rod to the entire film, the only character that is pure, blood-spitting bad. The story hinges on Kurt Russell's character bringing her to justice and hanging her by the neck until dead.And it is in that story thread that The Hateful Eight becomes truly special. Tarantino and Leigh punish you with Daisy's wretchedness over and over again until you start to believe that total evil will win the day. That is until two characters who began as principle opposites learn to come together for a common goal. The climax of The Hateful Eight is at once both gutturally horrifying and profoundly hopeful. A hanging by an olive branch. In the most Tarantino fashion, he creates a statement about American tensions more moving than a dozen entire movies on the subject. It's about justice, human decency and male camaraderie, and it is satisfying on a spiritual level.The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino let loose. It comes from a writer who feels completely free. Tarantino is doing what he loves, and doing it with an earnest passion. He's making his own legend to stand alongside Leone and Eastwood. It just so happens that when Quentin Tarantino simply messes around and has some fun writing interesting characters, it can be more substantial as a visual and intellectual piece of art than almost anything else.96/100"

But if you cut the movie properly, it could become a good short film."

A friend went to the cinema to see it and said it was really boring, but that wouldn't have put me off. Anyway that aside I loved it. A claustrophobic thriller with great characters and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing till the end. I could almost see it as a play, which maybe down to the limited scope of the environment. Two or three characters would be engaged in a scene and in the background you can make out the other characters sat, and it looks like they are waiting for their scene. Another great Tarantino film. I think Hollywood will feel slightly emptier when he's finished his 10th and final film."

In my subjective opinion it is the most atmospheric film I ever watched. The weather fits in the movie great. I think it is stupid to say something about acting and characters because they are exciting. In no way it is not boring. That's something not everyone can do. Hateful Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness, snow and atmosphere. Damn it! Everyone must watch this film"
" My favorite Tarantino film
",0.4588,0.9932,2020-01-16 00:00:00,10,"I'm a long time fan of Tarantino, and also of westerns, and Hateful Eight tops my list for both.Acting - 10/10 - Obviously a hand picked cast that were perfect for their roles across the board, and delivered my favorite ""one room set"" type film. I love this kind of movie where performers are given a chance to shine, and deliver.Cinematography - 10/10 - Beautiful. Harsh. Cold desolation masterfully conveyed.Directing - My favorite movie, from one of my favorite directors. It really felt like Hateful Eight is the work of craftsmen, as opposed to something quickly and cheaply produced. Hopefully Tarantino looks back on this movie and smiles, because that's what I do. :)Audio and soundtrack - 10/10 - Tarantino has a long history of superb soundtrack selection, and I felt he hit it out of the park here. The music was enjoyable, quirky, and set the mood as only Tarantino can. Loved it. The non music audio successfully conveyed the sense of harsh Wyoming weather, and the time period for me.Overall: Among my top 5 favorite movies, and I plan to watch it at least a few more times. Everything good about Tarantino, westerns, and the spectacular cast is present in Hateful Eight. Highly recommended."
" The worst movie I've ever seen.
",-0.6249,-0.9035,2020-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Nothing, literally nothing is good about this movie.
The story is not only paperthin but also competely ridiculous.
The dialogue is extremely boring and for the most part completely irrelevant.
The whole movie is filled with irrelevant garbage that makes the movie drag on forever.
The action is lame, it tries to do something unique and entertaining but fails terribly.
The characters are poorly written and not interesting at all.
The pacing of this movie is slooooooooow, you could cut it down to a 30 min movie and it would still be really boring.
The decor was mediocre, nothing extremely bad, but certainly not appealing.
And lastly the music, it wasn't terrible but certainly didn't hold up to current movie standards.
It baffles me that there are people that pretend this movie is any good, all I can wonder is why?
There are so many good movies in existence, skip this pile of garbage and watch something else.
I'd rather look at a blank screen than sit through this abomination again.

I personally adored this film, people complained that this film lacks a hook of any kind and that it drags on. I could see where these people might be coming from but it personally, didn't bother me one bit. I loved this film. Stellar cast, especially Samuel L. Jackson being the standout in my opinion. The setting and look of the film looked exquisite, balancing the grainy look of a classic western mixed with a modernised cult type of look. The plot for the most part is something seen in other films but what made it work on a new level was the cast. It's simple, a bunch of strangers who are stuck in a house together for a few days start to figure out everyone's true colours and involvements with each other. This film balances out a slight sense of saltire mixed with intense drama and violence. It's Tarantino, what do you expect. There's one problem I had with this film, I found it dumb and it comes near the end. It's to do with a specific person named Channing Tatum. The twist was poorly executed and just didn't land for me and I felt the choice of casting Tatum was a mistake. But apart from that, I loved this film and definitely recommend it!"

Also, for anyone complaining about the characters being unlikable, that is the whole point! There is no one person to root for as they are all cynical liars from which the audience is left to guess.This is a movie for true fans of the mystery genre.

Setting is very important here.The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. Feelings about the American civil war are very up-front, with complicit atrocity present in nearly all the characters. The war brought out horrible things in these people, and we see how they deal with that shared knowledge, both personally and to each other."
" The Hateful Eight
",-0.4939,-0.9927,2019-12-18 00:00:00,10,"Maybe you noticed that Tarantino shares much in common with Guns frontman Axl Rose? I'm noticed. Both came into immediate fame and large successes early in their career (Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Rose with Appetite for Destruction), met widespread acclaim and fandom across the globe, and had personalities that stretched way out their respective industries that often earned them a streak of notoriety in the press.
But Tarantino and Rose differ on how they followed their instant celebrity. While Rose alienated his band mates and friends and turned Guns N' Roses into a parody of itself, Tarantino has bolstered himself with a series of equally originally and satisfying pictures that varied between genre and style. So even though The Hateful Eight on the surface may appear self-indulgent, with its extravagant promotion of its 70 mm projection, notorious production issues, and high profile staff (which includes a score from legendary composer Ennio Morricone), Chinese Democracy it is not. In fact, The Hateful Eight is arguably the most exciting and rigorous movie Tarantino has done since his magnum opus Pulp Fiction.As with Tarantino's previous picture, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight is a western, though set in the snowy fields of Wyoming in the 1870s instead of the pre-Civil War era south. Bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) has just caught notorious murderer Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and is taking her to Red Rock to be hung, accompanied by an ex-slave turned into Northern Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and incoming Red Rock sheriff and former confederate Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). After getting hit by a blizzard, the group arrives at a cabin known as Minnie's Haberdashery, met by its gruff Mexican caretaker Bob (Demian Bichir), cunning hangman Oswaldo (Tim Roth), southern General Smithers (Bruce Dern), and stern cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen). After meeting all of these peculiar characters, John suspects that one of these men is in cahoots with Daisy and is determined to protect his bounty no matter the cost.With its claustrophobic setting and eccentric ensemble, The Hateful Eight recalls the starkness of Tarantino's raw debut Reservoir Dogs. While that comparison is completely valid, particularly in the picture's structure, The Hateful Eight doesn't feel like a remake and makes much use of its western scenery to expand upon Dogs' setting. The snowy plains of Wyoming, shot in actuality in the Colorado Rockies, adds extra tension to the limited backdrop, and the theme of racism comes central into play. Django Unchained dealt with this by satirizing the Blaxploitation genre to present a rewriting of history through its eponymous protagonist's revenge against slave owners. In The Hateful Eight, Warren fills Django's shoes but comes in constant odds with the white men surrounding him, particularly with his background for killing confederate soldiers as well as having a letter from Abraham Lincoln, earning the ire of Mannix and General Smithers. Whereas Django lived an ultimate fantasy, Warren settles with having to put up with oppression during the post-Civil War era, learning to deal with system racism and n-bombs. Jackson has rarely been in fine as form as Warren, giving him the spunk of Jules while playing into his bitterness.The rest of the cast is similarly magnificent, in particular Walton Goggins. Goggins has long shined on TV in roles in Justified and The Shield, and is simply in top-notch form as Mannix. He portrays the sheriff as a boisterous and seemingly racist man yet reveals a different side of the character in the second half of the picture as a more nuanced figure than I thought beforehand. Goggins' interactions with Jackson make up for many of The Hateful Eight's best scenes and he deserves multiple accolades for his performance.The selling point of The Hateful Eight though is undeniably its cinematography. Filmed in 65 mm film using the same lens that captured the mighty chariot sequence in Ben Hur, The Hateful Eight is one of the most gorgeous theatrical experiences I've ever seen. Robert Richardson's photography beautifully captures Wyoming's rugged setting in a way digital cinematography can't tape. Every detail, from the snowflakes to Russell's muttonchops, is recorded through Richardson's elegant film, and the crispness of the images made me feel as if I was watching a modern day Sergio Leone movie, further emphasized by Leone's collaborator Morricone providing a gigantic Stravinsky-esque score. Tarantino's decision to project The Hateful Eight in 70 mm may appear as a haughty one but displays the picture in the greatest form possible. With the screening's."

I loved the long & slow relaxed storytelling & interesting & strange characters, i love Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson & Bruce Dern!!!
A fantastic superb cast of talent involved.
The Hateful 8 is a long wild ride through the thick snowy countryside & further, the cold atmosphere is exciting & fun & full of mystery!!!
The dialogue is excellent & smart as usual for the genius Tarantino & his mix of strange characters are given full room to breathe & play out.
The performances are great especially from Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson!!! Both are on top form & are fantastic on screen.
Yes Kurt Russell is excellent & Samuel L Jackson is excellent, these two performances are the best in the film in my opinion, but hell the cast is superb all around!!!At times this movie definitely feels like it's Going into the Horror genre & feels very ""Evil Dead"" at times when the stage is set up at the stagecoach stopover where different travellers are taking refuge from a major blizzard.
There's an exciting who's gonna turn on who feel to it & a sense of doom, each character is given room to shine & when it gets bloody it gets bloody, old school brutal violence explodes accross the screen.
I loved the beautiful cinematography & the old school music score, this is top notch film making by a master at his most relaxed & confident.This is basically in a way Tarantino's ""The Thing"" but set around Civil War times & without an Alien but the mood, look, Atmosphere, music & the presence of the legendary Kurt Russell is just like ""The Thing""
This movie is truly OUTSTANDING in every single aspect, Tarantino has created his Cinematic Masterpiece.An excellent post civil war wintertime mystery adventure Thriller full of mood,atmosphere & great performances."

" What A Truly Awful Movie
",-0.0258,-0.9305,2019-12-01 00:00:00,1,"Count me among those who really, really disliked this movie. In general, I've had extreme reactions to Quentin Tarantino's work. Either I've really loved it, or ... well .. I really haven't. ""The Hateful Eight"" definitely counts among the latter group. I suppose one should give credit for the title at least. ""The Hateful Eight"" sums up my feelings about the characters perfectly. There's not a single one among them who I like; not a single one I would trust to look after a nickel for me. But they're also really not amusing or interesting. There's just nothing appealing about any of them. Which means that you get stuck sitting through almost 3 excruciating hours with them. At one point it seemed this movie had gone on forever, but then I checked and discovered there was still almost an hour to go. My Lord, it was painful. It does eventually seem to establish some sort of direction or purpose relatively late when we start dealing with the murder mystery - but in all honesty by the time that happened I was struggling to stay awake and just waiting for the torutre to end. It was truly a painful experience watching this. (1/10)"

" Tarantino's best film
",0.6369,-0.9903,2019-11-25 00:00:00,10,"A group of people are stuck in a small place in the middle of a blizzard that keeps them from escaping all while questions of who is actually who they say are abound, but enough about The Thing.Out of all of Tarantino's movies, this is the one that feels most like a novel. I know people equate it to a stage play, mostly because of the amount of dialogue and the limited location, but I feel like it has more in common with a literary creation than a theatrical one. Scenes play out at the kind of pace that you might expect from a book. They're steady and about building character more than anything else. I love luxuriating in these long passages as we figure out who the people in Minnie's Haberdashery are.The movie begins some miles away, though. On a mountain road, a black bounty hunter sits alone on a trio of corpses he's trying to bring into Red Rock, Wyoming. A stagecoach drives up carrying another bounty hunter and his live bounty, one Daisy Domergue, wanted for murder with a price of $10,000 on her head, dead or alive. The two bounty hunters come to an agreement to allow Marquis Warren onto the stagecoach as long as he helps protect John Ruth's bounty. The interactions between all three range from outright hostile (between Ruth and Domergue) to cautiously respectful (between Warren and Ruth). Warren eventually shares his Lincoln letter with Ruth, a letter written to Warren directly from Abraham Lincoln from when Warren was a cavalry officer during the Civil War.As they get closer to Red Rock, they pick up Chris Mannix who says that he's the new sheriff of Red Rock, but with the blizzard bearing down on them, they can't make it to Red Rock. They're going to make it to the only place between them and the town, a haberdashery run by Minnie and Sweet Dave, neither of whom are actually there when the three arrive to find the door broken and won't shut all the way without nailing in some boards to keep it in place. Something is obviously wrong.Tarantino, though, doesn't press that feeling just yet. He's got three hours to tell his story, and he's not in a huge rush to get to the end. The first half of the movie is really just scenes of getting to know the hateful eight characters. Aside from the four in the carriage, there's also the Confederate general, the cowboy, the Mexican, and the little man. There are connections between some of them that get dug out. Mannix's father was an officer in the Confederacy, and General Smithers had heard of him while Mannix had certainly heard of Smithers and revered him. Warren and Smithers had actually shared a battlefield at Baton Rouge, a battle noted by Warren for the savagery the Confederate army had exhibited towards the black Union soldiers, but Mannix, as the representative of the law, isn't going to allow Warren to cold-bloodedly murder Smithers no matter what Smithers ordered in the war, especially in the service of the Confederacy. So, Warren places a revolver next to Smithers in his chair and then proceeds to tell Smithers a tale about how Warren had met Smithers' son when he had come looking to collect on the bounty the Confederacy had placed on Warren's head. I'm fairly convinced that Warren lies extensively through the whole story (Tarantino offers it narrative credence by showing it occurring on screen instead of just allowing Warren to tell it), and it is enough to get Smithers to reach for the gun. Warren, though, is too fast and kills Smithers before Smithers can do the same to him.So begins the death at Minnie's Haberdashery, an act of vengeful murder masked as self-defense.That murder, though, is of a vastly different character as what comes next. It serves as a distraction for the poisoning of the coffee pot which ends up killing Ruth and their driver O.B. (not one of the hateful eight, apparently). These killings are done to weed out those not in on the rescue of Daisy, and suspicion, as well as tension, suddenly shoots up. We, as the audience, have known that something was wrong since they first arrived at the remote haberdashery, but we could never quite put our own fingers on it. Warren, though, has an inkling. He's been the Minnie's before, and he points out the inconsistencies, executing one of the three remaining of the four he had found upon first arriving (Mexican Bob). Gunplay ensues including shots fired from under the floorboards.Tarantino then does a signature jump backwards in time for a chapter dedicated to the events leading up to the beginning of the film. We see four men jump from a stagecoach earlier in the day. They settle in, we get to know the people already there including Minnie and Sweet Dave, before the four unleash hell and kill everyone except General Smithers whom they keep alive for character and to help sell the reality of the situation without Minnie around. One of these four is Jody, Daisy's brother, there to save his sister from the hangman.Jumping back to the present, we see how the rest plays out, and it's apocalyptic in feel. People die, blood gets splattered (especially in Daisy's face), and everyone's bleeding out. It seems like the movie has embraced nihilism completely, but I would disagree. Mannix and Warren are the last two alive, and they're both dying. Mannix asks to see this Lincoln letter that Warren has, and Warren hands it over. Reading it over, we recall an earlier scene where Mannix called the letter a complete fiction and Warren copped to it, but in their final moments, Mannix finds great solace in those invented words from Abraham Lincoln.Like in much of Tarantino's work, there's an element of the metanarrative at play, and here, in The Hateful Eight, it demonstrates the power of fiction to move us. Warren probably invents the story of Smithers' son's death, and it moves the old general enough to throw the rest of his life away. Daisy swears to a story of fifteen more members of her gang waiting to come and kill Mannix and Warren if they don't let Daisy go, and the story has an effect for a while. And finally the letter that Mannix has called a fake (which he crumples up and tosses aside after reading it) soothes him in his final moments after the worst day of his life.So, why do I love this movie so much? I remember off handedly mentioning the fact that I think that this is Tarantino's best movie to some people, thinking the comment was uncontroversial, and I was completely unprepared for the blowback. Some people hate this movie as much as the characters hate each other, and I honestly do not see why. Yes, the movie is slow, but it's slow in much the same way Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, and Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood are slow. All four movies take their time to build characters and set the scene before throwing their characters at each other to bloody result. The characters here are awful people, but so are most of the characters in all of Tarantino's movies. I love hearing them talk, egging each other on, and even beginning to respect each other. I love the 70mm cinematography, even if most of it is relegated to the haberdashery. I love the score from Morricone. The performances are great. The Hateful Eight creates a world that I simply love to luxuriate in. I simply love it as a film, and yes, I do think it's Tarantino's best work."

" Tarantino Hits High Marks With Second Western
",0.0,-0.6128,2019-11-16 00:00:00,8,Tarantino always delivers new ways to put forth tried and true cinematic themes. The Hateful Eight is his 2nd foray into the western genre and although this doesn't reach the high powered triumph of Django Unleashed it's still a cut above most. A kind of play on The Thing by John Carpenter Hateful Eight follows the theme of the enemy among us. Spectacular cast of which Samuel L. Jackson takes center stage in a complete reversal of his character in Django the movie almost entirely takes place in a cabin. From here is where the story of opposing political and moral themes come full throttle into a death grip with each other. High end filmmaking is such a pleasure to experience.
" Tarantino loves these modern twists on the Spaghetti Western genre
",0.5719,-0.9336,2019-11-14 00:00:00,7,"The Hateful Eight is the eighth film directed by Quentin Tarantino. A director that has thus far delivered a filmography of fairly graphic violent, dialogue heavy productions that draw comparisons to other genres.The Hateful Eight obviously draws parallels to the spaghetti western films that become popular in the late 1960s and featured heavily violent scenes in a Western environment and made mainly by Italian/Spanish filmmakers.The film was notable on release in 2015 for being filmed in a 70mm film format rather than the standard 35mm that most films are made in. 70mm allows for a wider screen, more detailed shots apparently. I don't see the significance with this film. Aside from the first few minutes that show the breathtaking scenery of a snowbound, stormy Wyoming, U.S. location.The story features some excellent casting choices most notably Samuel L. Jackson in a quite customary role. He plays a bounty hunter that reminded me more of his role in Die Hard: With A Vengeance with his seemed hatred of whites and use of the N word. Kurt Russell plays another bounty hunter, John Ruth who is transporting his captive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the town of Red Rock.As the weather worsens outside into a stormy blizzard Ruth in his stagecoach takes shelter at a seemed bed and breakfast like location that the rest of the 'long' film is set in, Minnie's Haberdashery. The Haberdashery is the location as a group of highly dangerous, suspicious looking individuals take shelter. Each one armed, ready to kill each other. However where is the film going. It certainly takes a couple of hours for the impasse at the Haberdashery to take place at which I was left asking that very question to myself. It is only in the final act that the plot thickens. A good plot but difficult to maintain concentration for such a long time.The film is as standard with Tarantino films dialogue heavy and consistent with his films in having memorable set pieces. The violence can be quite graphic and is not for the squeamish viewer. I am certainly glad I viewed the film although I would struggle to do so in a single sitting. An intermission is needed and was provided on its cinema release. In my case the intermission was overnight."

The rest is unrelenting slaughter...as someone remarked, talk talk talk murder talk talk talk murder! One would have to wonder about a mind that can think up this sort of brutality.

In my opinion Jennifer Jason Leigh steals the show on this one, her performance is very good along with other great actors that have been working with Tarantino for many movies now such as Morgan Freeman and Kurt Russel to name a few.
This movie has a slow pace but that was a not a problem for me as Tarantino delivers dialogues that will make time pass by very fast. Also the suspense that builds up in this movie is great, Tarantino did a great job directing this movie as you want to know what is going on inside Minnie's haberdashery and who is the villain in the story.

I feel I might have mislabeled it as Typical Tarantino though. It's actually terrible. The fanboys are gonna love it no matter what. They'll ignore every overly contrived plot hole to get to the obligatory gratuitous violence. This movie is so bad Kurt Russell can't save it. This movie is so bad, that I stopped it when the narration came in mid movie because I thought the DVD had malfunctioned. That's not even an exaggeration. Kurt Russell carries this movie half way to greatness. You'll think my review is BS up until the Intermission, where Tarantino shows up to show hids true colors.

I understand why the bounty hunters killed Minnie in a sense, but it almost feels avoidable, especially since Mr. Warren is know for being a very intelligent bounty hunter, as he defuses the situation at hand. We also are introduced to Jody, but he gets barley any screen time in this VERY long flick. I actually enjoyed Tatum's character, but it is short lived and underwhelming for sure.

It is a follow up of 'Django Unchained', set few years after the Civil War. The spoilsport is the editing, that perpetually gets the narrative freezing like the temperature outside the cabin, wasting a lot of time and the acting capabilities of its charismatic cast.Relying heavily on a one man show by Tarantino's favorite Samuel L. Jackson, who delivers his best act post Pulp Fiction, this 'Who did it?' thriller spends little time in developing the characters to get me guessing the wrong doer. It rather gets repetitive and too indulgent perpetually to serve no purpose. The redeemer is its third act, delivering the signature neat Tarantino violence, but waiting a long 150 minutes for it to happen becomes boring, especially while revisiting the movie. It sometimes gets me wondering that the movie and its action could have ended straight, if the initial conversion were :Major Marquis Warren - ""Got room for one more?""

" The Magnificent Eight- Credit should be given to maestro Ennio Morricone
",0.7579,0.991,2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,"""The Hateful Eight"" always been my Tarantino's favorite film since my first viewing (at home). The atmosphere, the acting, the production design, and most of all is the score by Maestro himself Ennio Morricone. This is kind of (western) noir film you shouldn't miss.As the film opens, my favorite first scene already gives me creeps. Not gonna lie, Ennio's score at the beginning is the best thing that happened and I'm addicted so bad to ""L'Ultima Diligenza di Red Rock"", a threatening crescendo that is reminiscent of horror movies, and in best Morricone style, towards the middle, it explodes, and transports the central theme he suggested to Tarantino: the ride of a carriage towards an uncertain future, in an atmosphere of menace. The oboes play joyously and add to the creeping up of the coming mayhem. A real Morricone thriller, but not so much in spaghetti western tradition.This is a thrilling, bloody and brutal film that is a blast from start to finish mixing together genres Western, Mystery and Action. With The Hateful Eight, Tarantino made a film that is a companion piece to his previous films like Inglorious Bas. and Django which are very much alike in scope, tone and look and if you seen all QT's pieces, it has all of the known elements: rich dialogues, the top of brutality and memorable characters that will stay with you for the rest of your life. It has also a great companion to Reservoir Dogs in terms of structure to this film, in which a bunch of strangers are together in one place where there is distruct and controversies between the characters but this time take place in the 19th century.The screenplay and direction by Tarantino is strong and fantastic with bringing his own usual flair, look and atmosphere to the film like his previous.The cast is magnificent starring: Sam Jackson is excellent as always as Marquis Warren, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins are terrific. Roth, Maddsen, Bichir, Tatum and Dern as a cast ensemble are great in one film.Overall, I give this film 10 out'a 10 because Tarantino hasn't done something like this before (except his style stays the same). Bravo!"

" For a Tarantino film, it's a bit of a letdown
",0.0,-0.9901,2019-08-05 00:00:00,5,"I just watched ""The Hateful Eight"" for the first time last night. I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and I think no director can make a movie quite like he can. Having said all that, I found ""The Hateful Eight"" to be a bit of a letdown because the first hour is so slow to get moving and then when it picks up in the second hour, it's better but there isn't a lot of memorable moments.Here's a brief look-Samuel L Jackson is a bounty hunter transporting dead criminals in the middle of a blizzard and then runs into a stagecoach that has another bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) transporting a rebel prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be hanged. Later on, they meet an outlaw (Walton Goggins) who just became the town sheriff.-Then they take shelter in a general store where the owners are nowhere to be found but they find four more strangers all with a secret. Among them are Bruce Dern as a former General, Michael Madsen as a suspicious cowboy and Tim Roth as the town hangman.After they're all introduced, something happens and it turns into a whodunnit/stage play.My basic problems with this movie are as follows
-There are scenes that just happen and there isn't a whole lot of back story to them
-This movie has double the amount of N-words as ""Django Unchained"". The big difference being Tarantino wanted to depict the brutal subject of slavery so, while I don't condone the word, I felt it made sense for ""Django"". Here, I felt they were saying it just to say it so it was really unnecessary.
-Every other scene involves Jennifer Jason Leigh getting punched in the face.
-Lastly, there's a sight gag that involves the door being too hard to open. It was funny the first couple times but it just kept going and it had nowhere else to go.I know a lot of people loved it but compared to his other movies, I found it disappointing."

" Tarantino's bloody western chamber piece is more Agatha Christie than Sergio Leone or John Ford
",-0.4404,-0.53,2019-07-27 00:00:00,10,"Terrific western from writer/director Quentin Tarantino is unexpectedly more Agatha Christie than John Ford. Bounty Hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth, played by the always wonderful and sadly underused Kurt Russell, is taking in wanted criminal Daisy Domergue, the also amazing Jennifer Jason Leigh, to hang. However, a blizzard forces them to hold up at a way station with a band of nefarious types, one or more of whom aren't who they say they are and are likely looking to free Daisy. In ""And Then There Were None"" fashion, character begin to get offed, and to reveal much more of the plot would ruin the fun of the film. Like most Tarantino films, this one is likely not going to be for all tastes, even if the film features a stellar cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson as a fellow bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, and Tarantino even casts Matt Houston himself, Lee Horsley, as a stagecoach driver, great plotting, terrific suspense, shocking moments of violence, and as you would expect from a Tarantino film, some incredibly sharp dialogue. Comparing this film to Tarantino's other work, this one seems closest to ""Reservoir Dogs"" in the sense that it's a bunch of characters stuck in a confined space doing a lot of talking and tough guy posturing, leading up to a bloody climax. And boy it is a wildly bloody climax, courtesy of special effect maestro Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. But since Dogs, Tarantino has matured as a director and continues to top himself each time out, branching out and challenging himself with something new and different with each new film and ""The Hateful Eight"" is no different. Also of note, the film features composer Ennio Morricone's first western score in many years and also his first American film score in quite some time (his last was ""Ripley's Game"" in 2002). It's a strangely moody score when I was expecting a score filled with crazy stings and whistles, ALA Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci. Morricone's score is more along the lines of his score for John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" which this film actually uses some tracks from. But the highlight of nearly all of Tarantino's film is his dialogue and this film features more verbal sparring matches than any of his films, which is endlessly delightful. From the his first film, with Mr. White and Mr. Blond facing each other down (""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? Or are you gonna bite?""), it was clear that Tarantino knew how to use dialogue to build tension, and his skills have only gotten better since then. The way characters play with one another, trying to outsmart and outwit one another is endlessly watchable. And upon a second viewing of the film and the dialogue can be reinterpreted and takes on new meaning once the audience knows character motivations and where the story is heading. Thematically, I think Tarantino has always played with genres but with this film is commenting on modern race relations through this tale of violent bounty hunters in a post-Civil War old west. It's the racial tensions following the Civil War that Tarantino uses to put the ugly views on race front and center that you can today hear on cable news or read online just about anytime you want. Of all his films, this one seems his most mature and I think arguable his best. Still, like most of his film, they are not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're a film buff, Tarantino's film vocabulary that he infuses into each of his films is utterly intoxicating."
" Another bloody Tarantino western
",-0.4404,-0.9994,2019-07-27 00:00:00,7,"Originally conceived it as a novel and sequel to Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight marks both a major change in Tarantino's career - it's the last he'd make for The Weinstein Company, as he ended his relationship with them following allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein - while yearning back for the days of 70 mm films, as this was released as a limited edition roadshow in theaters that could still show it before it made its way to modern theaters. It's also the first of his films to be re-edited as a longer miniseries for Netflix.Tarantino was inspired by the TV Westerns that he had grown up watching, particularly episodes where bad guys would come to town and take the heroes hostage, saying ""What if I did a movie starring nothing but those characters? No heroes, no Michael Landons. Just a bunch of nefarious guys in a room, all telling backstories that may or may not be true. Trap those guys together in a room with a blizzard outside, give them guns, and see what happens.""Bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel Jackson) is on his way to Red Rock with three dead men when he hitches a ride from a stagecoach driven by O.B. Jackson (James Parks). Inside is John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his captive, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who he is also taking to Red Rock for hanging. The two men know one another, as they bonded over Warren's personal letter from President Abraham Lincoln. Another man, militiaman Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins), joins them as he's also traveling to Red Rock to become the town's new sheriff.However, the trip runs into a massive snowstorm, so they decide to visit Minnie's Haberdashery, where they learn that Minnie (Dana Gourrier, Cora from Django Unchained) has gone to visit her mother. The stagecoach lodge is filled with all manner of scum and villainy - Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), who claims to be traveling home to visit his mother; Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), a British hangman who ends up being English Pete Hicox, making him Archie Hicox's - from Inglorious Basterds - great-great grandfather; and General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern), who is on his way to bury his son.Ruth doesn't trust anyone, so he takes everyone's guns but Warren. The group all has stew together, with Mannix realizing that Warren's letter from Lincoln is fake, which angers Ruth. He feels lied to while Warren explains that it allows him to move amongst white people more easily. Then, he gives Smithers a gun, hoping he reaches for it after he explains how he tortured, assaulted and killed the man's son in revenge for Smithers' executions of black soldiers at the Battle of Baton Rouge.While Warren shoots Smithers, everyone misses the coffee being poisoned. Jackson and Ruth both drank it and start throwing up huge amounts of blood before Daisy kills her captor with his own gun. There's a flashback where she sings the traditional Australian folk ballad ""Jim Jones at Botany Bay"" on a vintage Martin guitar that had been loaned to the production by the Martin Guitar Museum. Somehow, no one told Kurt Russell that the guitar needed to be switched out before he was to destroy it, so the entire set was freaked out that an irreplaceable guitar was destroyed. Needless to say, the museum no longer loans out its guitars.Warren disarms Daisy, leaving her shackled to the dead body of Ruth, while holding everyone but Mannix at gunpoint. He quickly deduces what's happening - Minnie hates Mexicans and would never hire one, much less leave them in charge. Bob has to have killed her, so he kills the man, When he moves to kill Daisy, Gage admits that he was the one who poisoned the coffee. Then, someone in the cellar shoots Warren directly between the legs and all hell breaks loose. Mobray pulls a gun and shoots Mannix, who fires back on him.That's when we learn that Mobray Bob, Mobray, Gage and Daisy's brother Jody (Channing Tatum) had come to the lodge in disguise and killed everyone but Smithers, telling him that they would spare him if he stays quiet (Zoe Bell and Lee Horsely make appearances here). Mannix and Warren may be wounded, but they still have the advantage. Luring Jody out of hiding by threatening Daisy, he comes up from the cellar only to be shot and killed.What follows is a long Mexican standoff between Warren and Mannix with the dying Mobray, Gage and Daisy, who continually attempts to manipulate Mannix into taking the money and killing Warren.The Hateful Eight is at once a return to the Western film while also a look back to Reservoir Dogs, in that no one is innocent and everyone pays for it with their lives. While so many of Tarantino's films afterward had promises of somewhat happy endings, none of that is in store for anyone in this movie.Accompanying all of the bloodshed is a new score by Ennio Morricone, the first Western that the Italian composer had scored in 34 years. Tarantino had previously used Morricone's music in Kill Bill, Death Proof, Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds. There are also three unused songs from Morricone's score for John Carpenter's The Thing and ""Regan's Theme"" from Exorcist II: The Heretic.Despite saying that he would never work with Tarantino after his displeasure with how his music was used in Django Unchained, Morricone came around and worked with him. Perhaps that's because he liked the script, but Morricone was also given complete freedom to score the film, which he saw as an adventure instead of a Western. After a little over a month, Morricone gave Tarantino five pieces of music, which he could use in the movie however he wanted.In addition to fifty minutes of Morricone's music, the film also features the songs ""Apple Blossom"" by The White Stripes, ""Now You're All Alone"" by David Hess from The Last House on the Left and ""There Won't Be Many Coming Home"" by Roy Orbison from The Fastest Guitar Alive.At once a rumination of both The Thing and Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Eight may not be my favorite Tarantino film, but it's hard to deny that it's a great film, filled with ambiguity and bereft of morals."

",0.2732,0.7778,2019-07-24 00:00:00,9,I did watch this move on film in 70 mm so that might have added to enjoyment. Overall a very good dialog driven movie.
" Gave the Extended Version a shot...with regret
",-0.4215,0.9329,2019-07-20 00:00:00,6,"I love Quentin Tarantino films. Name any or all--I've seen them and can comment on all of them positively.With one exception.Let's start with what's great about this feature:
70mm film looks beautiful, cinematography and lighting is gorgeous! Imagining a whole film crew going out in the middle of nowhere to shoot scenes for big film while it is actually snowing out boggles the mind. This really shows the ambition and hunger for overcoming a challenge the crew had. The continuity throughout is impeccable; I really believe they shot this in one night, and have to remind myself: this was shot over weeks and months! Crazy. The acting is quite good, as to be expected.Let's slow things down. Let's slow things waaaay down:
What I dislike about this movie most is the plot itself. It's a film marketed as a mystery/thriller, yet ""the big reveal,"" is cheap. The twist and turn at the end just left me thinking, ""Why did I sit through this if the conclusion is just that everyone dies?"" It worked in Reservoir Dogs, so why doesn't it work here? Is it because the good guy doesn't actually win, or that there aren't really any good guys anyway? No--it's not that. It's that fact that this story is entirely from the imagination of someone I am a huge fan of, who takes us on this journey for 4.5 hours...but the drop off doesn't land at all. There's a ton of tension and build, and (being this is actually my 2nd viewing) there are so many hints and lack of hints at the beginning that could build to great climax.
For me, it all falls apart when Samuel L Jackson has his monologue at the Confederate general; the dialogue feels so sophomoric, modern, and silly that it stands out. Anyone could see in plain sight that Samuel L Jackson's character is totally making up the story to get a rise out of the general, as he presents no concrete evidence he's ever met the general's son, but the general--either with old age, alcohol, or both--is just too emotional to contain himself.
From this point on, it just all goes off the rails and suffers under its own ambition: the audience member is thinking, ""there's no this is going to end is a fun, new, exciting, and satisfying way,"" and it doesn't.I just wish this was a lot more. There is a way to do films in the same room the whole time in a satisfying way, but this missed every mark. There wasn't enough there to make this, even remotely, meet that standard Tarantino has set for himself. I wish we could have seen more flashbacks to Jackson's character's war, or what Legih's character did, or who Kurt Russel's character was, etc. etc. etc. The fact that one of the main marketing points for this feature was the use of 70mm, and we end up in the same room for three hours is such a cop out for as established of a director as Tarantino. The story is the tension in the room? Well if that's the case, make the people in the room more interesting."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.3612,2019-07-17 00:00:00,4,As with all Tarantino films it's shot beautifully hence the 4 stars. The story and the rest was just terrible. A shame really as I was expecting more from it.

It is worst than Death Proof, which I thought was the worst Tarantino film before I saw this. Most of the movie takes place in one room, so there is not much to look at. I give it a 5 because Tarantino always has good actors in his movies and his camera work is always good."

You will hate some gruesome scenes but you will love the plot. They way American Civil War is touched in the scene is amazing. No wonder once again I was googling about the American Civil War after watching the film. Still you want another reason to watch this film then Samuel L.

" Quentin Tarantino Can Do Much Better Than This.
",0.4404,-0.9436,2019-06-01 00:00:00,4,"Quentin Tarantino wanted to make a movie that's 2 hour and 30 mins long, but he had no good plot, so he dragged on and on and on.
Daisy Domergue should have been shot when John Ruth and OB were poisoned. it is called damage control y'all. See no point for Major Marquis Warren to live Daisy and the rest of the gang alive after John Ruth was dead. Warren sure sensed danger. Instead of damage control, Warren kept on deducting and talking until he was shot, and when the bad guys got the upper hand, the story didn't end there. The story dragged on for another 40 mins. The end is just pathetic because all the good guys and all the bad guys died.my god, Quentin Tarantino could do much better than this. What happened? I think it is because he's getting old. Too old to write/ direct a good movie.
The only exciting acting was by Walton Goggins. There's a little twist to his characteristic.SAD"
" Pretty, glorious, and brutally funny
",0.743,0.9567,2019-05-30 00:00:00,8,"I saw Quentin Tarantino's 8th film on opening night in 70 mm, intermission and all. It was pretty big and fantastic, if not a little bit exhausting. Thankfully, the intermission allowed for a bathroom break.I just watched it again, now 4 years later, as the extended edition on Netflix, broken into four episodes, and in UHD 4K.The snowy vistas in high def digital are as epic and beautiful as you'll see in any film. The majority of the story happens indoors, though, in Mimi's Haberdashery, which provides a more intimate feel, as if you are alone with these characters with the blizzard outside, and the noisy footsteps on the wooden floors inside (You need two boards!)The featured racism of Tarantino's films, and liberal use of the ""N"" word, doesn't age well with time. It jars. It seems less funny, and even a little sad. But it is what it is, and will stand the test of time in its quality, and what it tried to say as an adjunct to entertainment. What cannot be denied are the performances that Tarantino brings out of his eclectic mix of characters. Walter Goggins still is a standout performance, and thankfully, a redemptive one.I look forward to seeing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, knowing that QT will once again bring together time, music, set pieces, gore, dark humor, pulpy dialogue, and more - and would also like to see how his take on the more regrettable aspects of our culture has (or hasn't) evolved over the last few years."
" A rare Tarantino misfire
",0.0,-0.8342,2019-05-28 00:00:00,5,"On the surface and premise alone, this film gives the impression of another strong outing from the mind of Quentin Tarantino: a group of nefarious characters take shelter from a Wyoming winter storm together, unaware of one another's intentions. Unfortunately, the end product is anything but enjoyable, a tedious story lumbering between each subplot, split up by occasional shots of gratuitous violence.The Hateful Eight suffers in part from trying to be ""more Tarantino than Tarantino"", playing on his movie trademarks to the point of annoying the audience. A prime example is shown in the opening scenes, where a single drawn out shot of the US wilderness is shown for around 5 minutes. Whilst bearable to begin with, these clichÃ©s soon drag, and by the end of the considerable run time you'll be looking for the door.The story lacks any real cohesion as well, opening on the pretence of an intricate backstory-driven tale, but in practice offering little development. Samuel L Jackson (and for the most part, the rest of the cast) give noble performances, but they aren't enough to truly elevate this film. The cinematography is exquisite where given the opportunity to shine, but the limited focus of the film prevents this from really salvaging the story.Having tried this film several times, on each occasion I was met with the same senses of both creeping boredom and annoyance at the promise not capitalised on. As with actors and directors of Tarantino's calibre, there is a delusion to immediately hail any work as an immediate classic - The Hateful Eight does not deserve to be included in this category."
" It was ok
",0.296,-0.1603,2019-05-27 00:00:00,7,"Nothing special, and overly stylised, but watchable."
" Tarantino does mystery with western trappings
",0.0,0.9905,2019-05-25 00:00:00,8,"Following 2012's ""Django Unchained"", Quentin Tarantino once again returned to the American west for his next feature, ""The Hateful Eight"". With a title reminiscent of ""The Magnificent Seven"", you might expect a rip-roaring yarn chock full of action. However, the movie actually owes much more to mystery novels by the likes of Agatha Christie than it does to traditional Hollywood westerns. The narrative even follows a literary structure which includes some narration from Tarantino himself.The titular eight are a group of nefarious individuals brought together in a cabin by a snowstorm. Two of the most prominent of these are a bounty hunter and his notorious prisoner who carries a price of $10,000 on her head. It isn't long before suspicions arise that one or more of the others might have a stake in seeing that this prisoner doesn't get brought to justice. There are shades of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in this setup, which probably isn't just a coincidence.Despite being more of a mystery than a western, ""The Hateful Eight"" is nevertheless a more traditional Hollywood depiction of the west than ""Django Unchained"". That being said, the snowbound setting and the strong mystery angle give the movie a unique flavour. I can't really think of any other western quite like this. Tarantino's script has his trademark mix of violence and impeccable dialogue which in this case is in service of a well constructed mystery plot. The movie is dialogue heavy due to the confined setting limiting the amount of action taking place but it does move along fairly briskly. Still, the extended length (nearly three hours) will likely try the patience of some viewers.As always, the casting is excellent. Several vets from past Tarantino movies returned here including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Walton Goggins and Bruce Dern. That's a great starting point and then you throw in Jennifer Jason Leigh, who ended up getting an Oscar nomination for what is arguably the movie's most memorable performance. To me, the movie harks back to ""Reservoir Dogs"" by having a relatively small cast strutting their stuff in a confined setting.Tarantino's direction is flawless, as usual. That being said, he somewhat confusingly decided to go through the considerable effort of using 70mm photography for this picture, which was mostly wasted on an interior set. That approach would have been better suited to ""Django Unchained"", which had more varied environments. Be that as it may, the visuals are consistently attractive. However, they're overshadowed by Ennio Morricone's moody score, which is one of the movie's strongest points (and also the winner of an Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA).Ultimately, ""The Hateful Eight"" doesn't quite stack up to Tarantino's best efforts but it's still a good movie. It contains some interesting commentary on race relations along with a subversion of typical feminist tropes whereby in this case we're treated to a strong female villain instead of a hero. I'm not sure how well it stands up to repeated viewings because of the whole mystery angle but it's intricate enough that you probably won't remember all the twists and turns of the plot."

All his movies since Jackie Brown have been at least overlong (Django, Kill Bill), and at worst self-indulgent and boring (Inglorious Basterds and this one)."
" ""Keeping You At A Disadvantage, Is An Advantage I Intend To Keep""

Excellent direction, screenplay, setting, cinematography, costume, score and acting. All of the cast deliver top notch performances. Russell, Leigh, Jackson, Roth and Goggins in particular stand out creating some very memorable characters. The plot is set in post - Civil War Wyoming when a well known bounty hunter known as, ""The Hangman"" and his current prisoner Daisy are joined by another bounty hunter and a man claiming to be the new sheriff of the town their heading to. The four are forced to stop at the well known Minnie's Haberdashery due to an impending blizzard. There they encounter four strangers already inside the stop. Things don't seem right to some of the eight including the fact that Minnie isn't there. That's where the mystery and interragation of the eight strangers begins. The plot is clever, funny, gritty, dark, brutal, violent, unique, duplicit and has a phenomenal ending. The dialogue is unparalleled and you'll hear fans of the film quote such lines as the Hangman's, ""Keeping you at a disadvantage is an advantage I intend to keep"". That line could be relative to Tarantino and his contemporaries. The film is captivating throughout which is difficult to do when most of the plot takes place in one setting. That's the brilliance of and speaks volumes of a true artist like Tarantino. This is the best of his westerns and is one of the very best in the genre."
" Everything You Would Expect From A Three Hour Tarantino Western. Bring A Pillow.
",0.0,-0.1666,2019-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Can one actor really stand out in a crowd if every actor has a part of equal importance? Here is the main problem with this film - Tarantino cannot self-edit at this point in his career.If this film would have been a first-effort by an up-and-coming writer/director, it would have been cut to 90 minutes... Many of the lengthy scenes traveling through snow, planting spikes in snow, tracking blood in snow, etc. would have been removed or reduced to transitions... The dialog would have been cut down for 'lesser characters' (of coarse, the young writer/director would have needed to decide which characters to cut down, which Tarantino would never do)... There would have been less gore, blood, vomit, etc... And, these changes would have made a better movie.There were many great performances in this film, but they all get watered down in the 'grandeur' that is Tarantino's version of an epic western. When it ends, most viewers will be tired of watching 'The Hateful Eight', and educated viewers will wish more of the special 70 mm film would have been left on the cutting room floor.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

",-0.4939,0.9683,2019-04-30 00:00:00,6,"Now, first things first. This movie lasts for two hours and forty five minutes. Get ready for that. I'm saying this because if you expect a beginning with a lot of action, like Django, it won't happen. Nevertheless, there is not a single reason why that should be something bad and it isn't. And to end this quick introduction, Tarantino delivers once again.Tarantino follows the same structure he's used before but his style did change a lot for this movie. It is interesting as it gets and you will definitely not get bored with this (unless you're expecting an-Inglorious Basterds amount of violence which is why I mentioned the first thing). There is quite an amazing deepness that we get of the main characters and their stories. Tarantino also likes to get to a specific time in history and represent everything about it, the social and cultural aspects, and he does it again in here. And the violence does get screen time, don't worry, but it is in just the right amount to build tension and also to not make the story longer than it should be.Quite an amazing movie, I totally recommend it. For those who haven't seen it, enjoy. And for those who have, I hope you were able to appreciate the quality of the film."

You don't get to see them that often anymore. Then he films 90% of the movie inside a cabin. What?!? Oh boy, I knew then I'd been had, again, by QT. I don't like the expression but I'll use it anyway: QT jumped the shark many, many years ago. He fell into the same trap as Brian DePalma (one of my favorites). DePalma was great at paying homage (ripping off) Alfred Hitchcock. Then he began ripping off himself. QT payed homage to many different film makers. Now, he just pays ""homage"" to himself. Skip ""The Hateful Eight"" and watch QT's ""Reservoir Dogs"" instead. They're both the same movie and ""Reservoir Dogs"" is an hour and a half shorter."

",0.1511,0.9615,2019-04-23 00:00:00,8,Great work of Quentin Tarantino. Great styling of the actors. Everything is felt at the highest level. The scenery is just super. The plot is very interesting and exciting. The story holds you from beginning to end. There is a rod that does not let go of the viewer and keeps him in suspense until the hanging...
" Great, but could be better
",0.7506,0.9904,2019-04-19 00:00:00,8,"As Tarantino's eighth it carries the pressure of the other excellent films before it and, it suffers from that. The cinematography was gorgeous and the performances were amazing from everyone, especially Samuel L Jackson and Kurt Russell. My main issue is the run time and pacing. I do enjoy long films (such as Wolf of Wall Street) if the pace has a good balance of having interesting events and keeping the interest; while there are some fantastic scenes at the beginning middle and end everything in between feels longer than it should. Mind you, I was never bored but I felt like it was on the verge of something great but just dragged things out. It is very great even with that flaw and as a fan of Tarantino I had a fun and enjoyable time throughout."
" Maybe the best Tarantino's movie !
",0.6696,0.9599,2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"This is not movie for those who love action or for those who are expecting that something big will happen, this is a pure art of cinematography.
The main plot is set in the wooden cabin, which is presented with a large number of details and soundtrack makes every scene alive. The whole ambient makes you feel like you are inside that cabin.
Every character has its own story and you don't have the favorite one. Acting is masterpiece, huge attention is paid to the accent of every character and they looks so comfortable as they were not being filmed at all.
The story is not obvious, you have no clue where it is going like in many movies. I recommend this for those who are sick of ordinary movie and want to feel the spirit of the movie."

",0.4927,0.799,2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"I really like this movie. I think Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins are amazing in it, but also the others make a good job."

",0.0,-0.1253,2019-04-08 00:00:00,5,"Typical Tarantino fair in his post Kill Bill era. Very slow pace, endless talking, gore and violence that this time looks more out of place than in most of his films. It was good to see Michael Madsen and Jennifer Jason Leigh in a leading role once again, also Tim Roth was great but that's about it. Personally I had very little interest for the outcome of most of the characters and to tell the truth the predictably grand finale seemed forced even for Tarantino's standards. I can't say that I am a big fan of Tarantino and his work, but Reservoir Dogs changed my life as a cinema goer back in the day. His next few movies built upon this premise but after Kill Bill Tarantino changed his style, a style that he retains in all of his movies and I admit I don't particularly enjoy it."
" A good film with a slow second half
",0.4404,0.916,2019-04-06 00:00:00,9,"I think most people were expecting a action packed romp like kill bill or pulp fiction form Tarantino but I think that's both his and their faults as he's been directing mostly action flicks and as such has built an audience around them. The reason I respect Tarantino as much as I do is that even though he knew what his audience was expecting and demanding from him, he made the film he wanted which is something other directors could learn from him. Russel and Jackson are great and are followed by an equally great cast, I don't think I didn't enjoy anyone's performance. There is the racial undertones and sub-plot that I, as more right leaning white person, enjoyed and I do think that racism is something that we should take seriously and we shouldn't try to cut it out of our history as if we pretend that we never made any mistakes than we have nothing to look back and learn from. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries and dramas but maybe not action flicks or westerns."

Watch the movie, it is long but I enjoyed every minute of it, and yes those are a SLOW 3 hours but that's where the acting steps in. Idk why but in each of QT's movies the actors/actress ACT SO DANG WELL ITS AMAZING. The acting was absolutely fantastic."

",0.5927,-0.1849,2019-03-30 00:00:00,8,"The title is exactly that. The film is very long, however it's very very good. It keeps you on edge, the acting was fantastic and you are constantly wondering who the killer is.The only negative like I said is that it's too long, certain scenes are dragged out longer than they need to be. Majority of this happens in the first half of the film fyi.Overall, it's a film I would recommend if you have a long evening to kill, plane journey etc. If you have a short attention span it's probably not for you."
" Decent, but not great.
",-0.6642,0.9231,2019-03-27 00:00:00,7,"I like Tarrantino's movies. Pulp Fiction is my all time favourite.Hateful Eight, in my view, is Tarrantino's weakest movie. It's all rather pointless, as far as the story goes. The acting is great, it looks amazing, but the story just isn't there.It's meandering along, decently enough, but then randomly, three quarters of the way through, out of nowhere, Tarrantino starts narrating. Took me out of the movie, it was quite jarring. It was as if he didn't know what to do next so he literally explained the next couple of hours of the story away, just to skip some time.Samuel L Jackson's monologue (you'll know which bit I mean if and when you watch it) is awful. I understood the point of it, to provoke someone else, but it just seemed unnecessary.I'm ok with pretty much anything in films, if it's a decent film, and has a real point. Violence, sex/nudity, language, but that story from Jackson was just a waste of time.Anyway, if you're a fan, give it a go, you might love it. If you e never watched a Tarrantino film before, perhaps try Inglorious Basterds or Pulp Fiction (Jackie Brown is excellent and underrated), as they're far superior."

QT's films are all just looking the same now. All the deaths are meaningless and I didn't care.

" I wish there was more in this tarantino film
",0.4019,0.9922,2019-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Quentin Tarantino's new movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is coming out this summer. I'm super stoked for it and I want to watch all of the movies he has written/directed and one of them is The Hateful Eight, the movie I am reviewing today.I absolutely love Tarantino's style of filmmaking. The dialogue is fluid and very catchy. Even in his not so great films, his dialogue is still so damn good. Although, some of his movies have dialogue that doesn't propel the story along, and sometimes feels like a waste of time. I believe Pulp Fiction and The Hateful Eight suffers from that. The dialogue is still good, but it feels like it's just there just to be funny, with no other purpose. This is my biggest issue with The Hateful Eight. The second act has the most pointless but good dialogue.Like all Tarantino films, there is exquisite acting in this movie. Samuel L. Jackson has a top notch performance in this film, it could be his second best performance in a Tarantino film, behind Pulp Fiction. Kurt Russell has such a great performance in this movie, he's so good. Everyone else in this movie is also stupendous, especially Channing Tatum. When I saw his name in the opening credits, I was like ""wow, really, Channing Tatum, c'mon Tarantino you can do better than that."" And when Channing Tatum came onto the screen, I was really shook that his acting is as good as everyone else's performance in this movie. I did not expect him to be this good in this movie, and I was proven wrong. I didn't take Channing Tatum seriously as an actor until I watched him in this movie. Bravo, Channing Tatum.My biggest issue with this movie is the second act. The first act was decent, the third act was amazing, and the second act just wasn't that good. The second act is filled with pointless dialogue with nothing propelling the story. It was sort of boring for most of the second act. It was just characters sitting in one space doing almost nothing. If the whole movie was as good as the third act, this film would've been a masterpiece. The third act was intriguing, fast paced (in a good way) and with lots of twists and turns. The first act was the introductory act where all the characters get to know each other, and that was fun to see. This movie was a bit long, but if the second act kept up with the other acts, it would've been great. 8/10"

" First time ever I got really bored watching a Tarantino picture. It was meant to be a theatre play and somehow it lacks punch when it was turned into a movie.
",0.0018,0.8943,2019-03-20 00:00:00,4,"Somehow this Tarantino flick got me bored. And that is really the first time EVER that I got bored at a Tarantino movie. The masses seemed to love it though. The worse Tarantino's pictures seem to get, the more tickets he is selling at the box office. The average western fan will probably like this western anyway, because it does press all the right buttons that need to be pressed to please the audiences that like westerns. For a diehard Tarantino fan like me however, this movie is his worst ever.Tarantino often has said he will only make 10 movies in his entire carreer. This was nr. 8. After nr. 10 he promised that he will retire and start making theatre plays only. I do think Tarantino has got the talent to make another brilliant movie, but if not I hope he will stick to his own promise and retire pretty soon.The Hateful Eight originally was meant to be a theatre play and it would have fared better if it had indeed become a theatre play, because the dialogues are more suitable for a theatre than for a movie. The dialogues and scenes are incredibly long drawn and slow, without much change of scenery. Somehow these theatre play dialogues feel unsuited to be transformed to a movie format. For the first time ever I got bored at a Tarantino movie! Not a great record.Fortunately Tarantino will return to the gangster genre with his next movie. I am in dire need of another good Tarantino movie after this slowburning boring theatreplay mess..."
" A Good Western Movie
",0.4404,0.575,2019-03-16 00:00:00,7,This movie was good overall despite the 3 plus hour run time with spectacular cinematography and great performances by the cast plus the script was well written. The only issues I had with this movie was the very graphic violence and sexual dialogue.
" Great acting and build up, disappointing ending
",0.2263,0.9923,2019-03-12 00:00:00,6,"WIth such a long duration, the film had great opportunity to make a clean and exceptional ending, but instead it builds up to a messy bloodbath, ruining a potentially good movie and making The Hateful Eight a huge disappointment. Most of the movie is set in a single room, and for the most part it's just dialogue - Almost like a play.
The acting is superb, and while each of the characters has a villainous side, you'll end up rooting for all of them at the same time. And even though it's mainly just people talking, the suspense weaved into each line helps keep any viewer closely engaged.
Despite the good acting, the storyline itself is relatively straightforward, and many events that were probably meant to be ""plot twists"" were very predictable. Still, there were a few interesting scenes, and the explanation given near the end of the film helps satisfy many questions, at least until everyone starts shooting, and the plot crashes down. On top of the spontaneous violence, many of the film's breaks and narrations seem to be lazily done, separated by chapters and randomly introducing a narrator to help fill in some holes.
However, to be able to create an engaging film that takes place all in a single room with essentially no action for the first two hours is definitely a great achievement. The suspense and buildup was amazing, however, the execution really let the film down as far as films go."
" Thanks to John Carpenter By Way of Howard Hawks
",0.4404,0.8318,2019-03-05 00:00:00,4,"Tarantino's films have always been highly derivative, with in his case, a particularly powerful influence from the horror, gangster, action, Science Fiction and even Kung Fu genera films (many of them trashy) put out during the 70s and 80s... due in large part to his more than usual exposure acquired (as he seemed to believe that recommendations were part of his job), while working as a video store clerk during that era.
He has said as much himself, many times, being uncommonly open and honest about it, while even giving specific credit to many of the individual films and directors, by name, who and which were directly inspirational.
In other words the ones he stole from.
Who in their turn, may have stolen or been stolen from somebody else, while perhaps being less honest about it. Hey, which every writer director film maker and studio does as a matter of routine, whether by repeatedly pumping out some formula in film after film, or in cases where the theft is so obvious it can't be disguised, perhaps referring to an homage, or bereft of any other idea, in complete unmitigated purloinment even going so far as to use the same title (done all too often, and badly)? They call it a remake.
And I believe when you look at this latest film offering, and think about it, and if you're at all familiar with the efforts of John Carpenter who himself, much like Tarantino, was strongly influenced by the work of others, particularly Hitchcock, almost to the point of parody in a couple of instances... you'll see his remake version of Howard Hawks's (a director famous for having twice remade versions of one of his own films)* classic Sci-Fi offering of the early 50s, ""The Thing"". With Tarentino even going so far as to cast the main protagonist in that classic re-make of a classic, Kurt Russell, as one of the primary characters in this not exactly a remake but close enough to the Carpenter version to almost call it so.
I could go on and make a case for this comparison, and if I were a professional reviewer I would of course be obliged to, but I think I'm so right about this observation, that my making the connection here to anyone familiar with those films if they didn't catch it themselves, will see the strong obvious undeniable parallels and striking similarities right away.* ""Rio Bravo"" becoming ""El Dorado"" being transformed as ""Rio Lobo"" all with John Wayne."

Here was me in about the same era as a gem hustler in the bars of Rotterdam having to hear that lame dialogue. All I can say about the film the Hateful Eight that hasn't already been said, is that the way the 'four passengers' are allowed to saunter into a downhome establishment all heavily armed is an indictment on America - and this is the way an apparent huge part of their society still want the status quo to be. And as I have said before, if your only way to end a story is just by killing everyone, well you are a no-talent. Pay a writer, Tarrantino - you are a director."
" Tarantino being himself. Just as he should
",0.0,0.4588,2019-02-20 00:00:00,9,"A lot of the criticism aimed at this film seems to be based on the fact that it's long, tedious and relies too much on dialogue. But that's the thing about Tarantino - his films have always been wordy and dialogue-heavy. Think of all the non-stop banter in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, all the verbal flourishes in Inglorious Basterds and even Kill Bill. That's what makes him special. His writing is just as showy and over-the-top as his sense of humour and action sequences, that's what sets him apart from the rest of the crowd.The Hateful Eight has dialogue in spades, but not for a single moment did I find it boring or redundant. Excessive, certainly, but that's the whole point. I felt that it was used masterfully in order to build character and maintain suspense. By the end of the picture my feelings for the characters were so contradictory that it took about too days to process them. And when it comes to writing and acting, I consider this effect a job exceptionally well done.As for the generous 3+ hour screen time, it seems a bit misguided to bash a film for it in the day and age when people have no problem binging through a season or two of TV in a single night. What would happen if The Hateful Eight was 1.5 or 2 hours long? Could it tell the same story in an efficient manner? Most definitely. But is filmmaking really only about efficiency? Would it have the same sense of time and place, the same sense of character and isolation? I seriously doubt it.The only thing that stuck out for me was that the acting looked a bit stiff in the first chapter, but that's pretty much it. Everything else - the cinematography, the pacing, the story, Morricone's soundtrack - was spot on. All things considered, this is definitely one of my favorite Tarantino films out there."
" Another Tarantino Masterpiece

" Another great Tarantino film, but it feels a bit too long, and it feels a bit like a missed opportunity.
",0.7717,0.9991,2019-02-03 00:00:00,8,"(No Spoilers) The eighth film by Tarantino, and he's still going strong with another really good movie. However I do have to say I was a little disappointed.Let me get started with the positives of this movie. Basically everything is good to great until I get to some of the story elements. The cinematography is great, the dialogue between characters is great, the acting is great, the score is really great, I mean it's a very well made movie. There really isn't much to complain about except some tiny nitpicks. Seriously though, the actors and the dialogue between them is always great in Tarantino movies, they have some genuinely great and thought provoking lines, and then some seriously hilarious lines.Now onto the story, with one of my biggest problem, the pacing, and basically most of the 1st act of the movie. We spend about an hour in a stagecoach, and while the initial set up is needed, it's way too long. I mean it's barely that important to the story apart from the set up. It honestly starts to drag a lot till we get to the main part of the movie. Once were at the cabin Is when stuff starts to really pick up. Honestly for the first half of the movie I didn't really know what the plot of the movie was, it was only till around half way into the second act where I got it.The second act is when we get introduced to the other characters in the cabin which are all great. We basically get a murder mystery plot. I loved that section of the movie, but I feel like it could've used more time there. I mean the main mystery is resolved pretty quickly. I really like how this movie isn't linear showing you parts in different times, however there was this one section that should've maybe been placed later on in the movie. It was fine where it was, but I felt like having it that early on kinda ruins some of the suspense. I mean if I'm being honest I did see some of the twists coming, and while most of them are good, there are a few that don't really matter. For the most part though the though this movie was pretty unpredictable.My biggest problem is the movie just is too long, and doesn't focus enough on the best parts. A lot of the sequences feel like they could've been resolved quicker, and others feel like they were resolved too quick. Now I'm not someone who gets bored that easily with long movies, I love slow burns, but this just focuses on the wrong things. Not to say that those sequences are bad, not at all, but I just feel like it could've been so much better than it was.Overall I really did still enjoy this movie. All the actors do fantastic jobs, and the character interactions are just too enjoyable. There's some great thought provoking lines, which I wish they focused a little more on. The characters were just very well written. It gets political in some moments, and while I do think there are some good moments with it, I feel like they went to far in some areas. Regardless of that the technical aspects are just great like always. I especially loved the soundtrack. I just really enjoyed this movie, but I can't ignore that some of the moments needed more time, and some of the moments dragged on for too long.8/10"
" Good but needs editing big time
",0.2382,0.6542,2019-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Let me first say that I'm a huge Tarantino fan. I pretty much love the plots, intensity, actors and extreme violence in all of his movies. The Hateful Eight had some good plot twists but overall it was a bit disappointing. First of all it's way, way, too long, 3 hrs, 7 minutes. If they cut out an hour of the movie (maybe 90 minutes even), and turned into a fast thriller I would have bumped the rating up to an 8. There are definitely some scenes and conversations that could have been cut and it wouldn't have been a big deal. The second problem is that 95% of the movie takes place in the cabin. There is some brief but spectacular cinematography of Wyoming (nee Colorado). I definitely wanted to see more, I was going stir crazy in that cabin. How about throwing in a few flashback scenes of the Domergue gang in action or making it into a town somewhere? Overall if you're a Tarantino fan it's worth watching the movie just for the great actors, violence and plot twists, but the first 90 minutes are pretty slow."

",-0.2023,-0.965,2019-01-27 00:00:00,1,"I know it is not popular of me to say this. But Tarantino has been going downhill for a long time to me. He can not outdo himself with violence any longer, and his glory days I remember from the 1990s and the early 2000's are just not going to come back. So what does he do ? He takes a western, throws in the classic, ""Who is really who?"" plotline that has been done a thousand times, and he does not provide a good twist with it either. Chances are, you will have it figured out before the last half hour of a pointlessly long film.To top if off, he has to throw in racial slurs every five seconds. About the millionth time I had to hear it, it was like, ENOUGH ALREADY.I know Tarentino blabbered with endless justifications in interviews about the ending, but there is no art or point to be made with it. Just Tarentino violence and him trying to out do himself.It is sad that he took an all star cast, a plot that could have been good, and ruined it. I used to be a fan of Tarantino in the 1990s. Perhaps, I grew up and got mature enough that I actually would rather have substance over pointless vulgarity and violence."

",0.0,-0.1461,2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is a film that I could understand being misjudged. It is a slow burner, and even in that, nothing great happens throughout the movie. The screenplay is good, if not great, but even that does not shine. The characters are interesting, but not very deep.I think what makes this film so great is the sense of isolation, the claustrophobic feeling you get when you are stuck in a room with too many people for too long. The characters cannot help but interact with each other, and the personalities are forced out of people.I must also say that Kurt Russell's character is one of my favorites, as the bounty hunter determined to hand over personally his current bounty, for whom most of the story takes place.Really good movie.8 stars"

The character feel unqiue and there are tons of easter eggs hidden around. This is clearly a good vs bad guy type of movie, but what makes it so capitivating is all the grey inbetween. One of the characters may explain a horrific deed they performed, but under the circumstances they justify it. Among all the wit, there is an underlining moral and philosophical debate However, Tarantino makes these issues humorours with over the top violence, fantastic protagonists and treating real human inqualities satirically. It is an incredibly smart and fun movie.I've seen it a few times now and get captivated everytime. You have to enjoy this as a story of wit and just plain coolness."

It just goes on and on about nothing..The whole horse ride was so distracting by the amateur horrible eye lines. They couldn't even get the eye lines right? You don't have opposites look camera right as it creates distorted sense of direction. Second, the constant unnecessary use of the word ""nigg..."" I'm not offended by the word. It just had no place here and was totally overused in a way that wasn't called for. Just because you CAN use the word, doesn't mean you should.It took almost 40 minutes just to arrive where they needed to go. It's not like the journey contained anything that revealing or important that couldn't have been dealt with in 5 minutes.

I won't say the time period is portrayed flawlessly, but watching this movie will make you feel like you need a tobacco pipe and a high quality western jacket. The film's visual beauty is of course offset with the obscene and gruesome events that unfold in the haberdashery.Solid writing and acting as always, from Tarantino. I have to tip my hat to Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. In a movie loaded with great acting, their performances stole the show.If you like Tarantino, westerns, a good crime story, and just plain gruesome films then you will love The Hateful Eight."
" Western in Tarantino style but with some imprecisions
",0.0,-0.2476,2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,"The film is clearly divided in two parts. The first one is a bit boring (that's why many people under-rated the movie) because of the long dialogues about the historical contest in which the facts occur. So the first part is centered on the presentations of the various characters who introduce themselves by explaining their political positions (and, indirectly, their role in the storyline). In the second part, ""The showdown"", these characters are put in action and we finally understand who they really are. Blood, twists, subterfuge and unlikely cooperation: that's what we expect from a Tarantino movie. But we don't expect a mistake in the editing (if you see it you'll understand, I hate spoilering). But the production of this movie has been very controversial so this is forgivable."

Same story could've been told in a totally different backdrop and it would've been easier to pull off but, hey, worth the watch."

" Grow up Tarantino
",0.0,-0.936,2018-12-11 00:00:00,3,I am a big fan of the actors in this film. The middle of the movie becomes redundant with all the back and forth inside/outside confusion. I was offended by the violence towards the woman captive. The degradation and humiliation that Tarantino deemed appropriate to the movie content was unnecessary and borders on the approval of extreme violence towards women. I was disappointed in the actions of Mr. Russell and Mr.Jackson in agreeing to the degree of violence to be meted out to the female costar borders on sadistic behaviour. The constant battery was unnecessary to the story. Mr.Tarantino depends on twisting the parameters of shock value to help gather viewership. The content of this story is right up there with toilet humour.
" Great buildup, disappointing payoff
",0.2263,0.5987,2018-12-09 00:00:00,8,"A great film that goes a bit too far in places. The film feels very long but I don't really think that's a bad thing because I was never bored during it. The main plot is pretty good except for how it goes a bit crazy in parts. I don't really like those parts as it ruins an otherwise masterful western film. The plot is overall well written but there's a few parts in it that really are just poorly written. Obviously being a Tarantino film, all the dialogue is great. I wouldn't really recommend this unless you're a pretty big film buff because both of my parents fell asleep during this. To me this is an 8/10, my problems with it are more personal than anything else but they still stand out to me."

The Verdict: Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" is One Of His Best Finest Films Of All Time Not Since His Other Movie ""Jackie Brown"" Witch Was Not Brutal Violent At All, Actually ""Jackie Brown"" is The Only One Film Of His Where is Not Very Bloody, Just a Little Bit Of it But Not So Much Unlike His Other Films Like ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Django Unchained"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", ""Death Proof"" And Kill Bill Vol. 1 And Vol. 2 Were All Very Graphic And Gruesome Films With The Over The Top Violent Killing Scenes in Them...Anyways So What Was i, Oh Yeah! Back To ""The Hateful Eight"" i Have To Say i Love These Kind Of Movies Where You Have Say Like Four, Five Or 10 Mysterious Strangers Holding Up And Taking Shelter At a House Or a Wearhouse Hide Out. Bit Here in This Movie You Have 8 Mysterious Strangers That Are Forced To Stay Under in The Same Roof At a Place Called Minney's Haberdashery And These Hateful Characters is a Bounty Hunter Named ""John Ruth"" Played By Kurt Russell Who is Transporting a Wanted Fugitive Killer Woman Named ""Daisy Domergue"" Played By Jennifer Jason Leigh in a Oscar Worthy Nomination For Best Surporting Actress, Are Heading Towards a Town Called ""Red Rock"" in a Stagecoach That is Driving By a Man Named ""O.B."" Played By James Parks, And Along The Way They Stop For Two More People That They Encounter One is a Black Former Union Soldier That Turned An Infamous Bounty Hunter Named ""Major Marquis Warren"" Played By The Bad Ass Star Samuel L. Jackson And Chris Mannix a Southern Renegade Who is To Be The New Shreiff Of ""Red Rock"" Played By Walton Goggins ,Suddenly We Have John Ruth, Daisy Domergue, Major Marquis Warren And Chris Mannix Are All Going To ""Red Rock"" But Because There is a Very Bad Blizzard Coming Hard So They All Diedcide To Go To Minnie's Haberdashery Until The Snow Blizzard Pass By Them And Once John Ruth, Daisy Domergue, Chris Mannix, Major Marquis Warren And OB.

Drinked Poisoned Coffee That Somebody Put Poison into The Coffee Pot And That Killed Them Both, That's When Major Marquis Warren Starts To invisgate The Entire Solution Of What Really Happened Here in Minney's Haberdashery And Where is Minnie Herself And When Major Marquis Warren Pulls Off The Blankets And Covers From The Chair That Belonged To Minnie's Husband Sweet Dave Where He Always Used To Sit in As He Sees a Spot Of Blood On The Back Of Sweet Dave's Chair Where Sweet Dave Leans His Back On This Sent Major Marquis Warren Off As He Grows More Mad As He Knows That Minnie And Sweet Dave Have Bern Murdered So He Blames There Murder To Bob Who's Actually Name is ""Marco The Mexican"" And Marquis Warren Shoots And Kills Marco The Mexican Then Out Of Nowhere Major Marquis Warren Gets Shot Right in His Crotch Area By Another Person That is Actually is Daisy Domergue's Bother ""Jody Domergue"" Played By Channing Tatum Who Has Come To Rescue And Save Daisy From Being Hanged, But Ultimately He Fails As The Enjured Major Marquis Warren Shoots Him in The Back Of The Head And His Blood Splashs On Daisy Domergue's Face And Eventually All Of The Characters All Die in The End Of This Movie Just Like The Main Characters Died At The End Of Reservoir Dogs Well Expect Mr. Pink Who Survives The Shootout Between The Other Characters And Walked Away. Again i Thought ""The Hateful Eight"" Was One Of The Greatest Tarantino Films Of All Time. The Cast Were Brilliant Terrific Even Kurt Russell Was Good Til His Character's Death Happens As ""John Ruth"", So Was Demian Bichir's Part Was Good Til He Gets Shot By Samuel l. Jackson's Character, Then We Two Of Quentin Tarantino's Best Actors Tim Roth And Michael Madsen That Them Two Started Together in Tarantino's First Film ""Reservoir Dogs"", Jennifer Jason Leigh From ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" Who i Thought Was Great For Being An Quentin Tarantino Movie For The First Time, Finally Tarantino Put An 80s Actress in His Own Film And Bruce Dern Which Was Brilliant To See And Watch Him Play Another Character, But The Two Main Stars in This Film Are Samuel l. Jackson Who Delivers An Electrifying Performance And Possibly One Of The Greatest Roles Of His Career As ""Major Marquis Warren"", And Walton Goggins Who Also Delivers An Standout Performance As ""Chris Mannix"" Epespecially Since Samuel l. Jackson And Walton Goggins Are Last Reminding Two Characters As The Both Of Them Hanging Daisy Domergue To Her Death. Also The Score Of This Movie Goes Out To Ennio Morricone The Legendary italian Mastero Who Did The Man With No Name Film Franchises And John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" Another Thing To About The Hateful Eight is That The Movie Won For Ennio Morricone's Score For The First Time Ever Which I'm So Proud Of That Morricone Won For This Film. The Hateful Eight is One Of My Second Favorite Movie Of Quentin Tarantino And The Other Film Of His is Jackie Brown Which is My Favorite Too."
" Not bad but utterly pointless

Somehow, the Tarantino sycophants & fanboys think that is a good thing. Actually, they appear to think it is a great thing. I never ranked Tarantino sycophants up in the same ozone as Nolan sycophants, but anyone who rates this above a ""7"" is in that category.

THE HATEFUL EIGHT is really a Mystery, and for the most part, could have been set in any century involving an eclectic roomful of people, and, as already known/shown in the Samuel L. Jackson-led expository trailers, somebody's not who they're supposed to be.The first act overrides Tarantino's last venture simply by looking and feeling like we're really outdoors as opposed to a contrived exterior set, which DJANGO UNCHAINED, especially during the sequence following the opening credits, really seemed like...With gorgeous wide shots of snowy mountainous regions and a soundtrack by none other than Spaghetti Western guru Ennio Morricone, HATEFUL sounds like the real thing while you can genuinely feel the freezing cold as a stagecoach full of our central characters, including Kurt Russell's fitfully nicknamed bounty hunter The Hangman is bringing Jennifer Jason Leigh's grotesque white trash Wanted killer, with more bruises than brains, to the town of Red Rock... alive, not dead... while semi comic-relief Walt Goggins plays a supposedly future sheriff and last but not least, Sam Jackson, as Major Marquis Warren, explains what's up, both on the road and within our central location where 95% of the picture takes place: a barroom/way-station where no one can leave to Red Rock (a sort of geographical McGuffin) since there's a big bad blizzard raging outside.Although Tarantino has publicly denounced John Ford as any kind of Western Genre influence, leaning more on Sam Peckinpah and of course, Sergio Leone, some of the best and most effective character-developing dialogue takes place inside the vehicle itself, and is reminiscent of what's arguably Ford's best film, STAGECOACH, that catapulted John Wayne's career...And if anyone on board takes the Alpha Male Wayne role it's Russell's no-nonsense John Ruth who, during this three-hour plus cinematic stage play, maintains the best verbal momentum throughout (basically doing a Duke impersonation)...His anti-chemistry/reluctant-partnership is strongest with Jackson while there should have been more palpable angst towards Leigh's Daisy Domergue - whom he's literally, annoyingly chained to. Yet both seem as if they're in completely different movies, and Russell's is much better... if only he captured anyone else but Leigh, an actress that, despite being otherwise talented, is downright embarrassingly campy here.Meanwhile, putting the forgettable Ennio soundtrack aside, EIGHT isn't Leone-influenced but more an overlong hybrid of RESERVOIR DOGS, which co-starred two wasted HATEFUL characters Michael Madsen and Tim Roth (the latter doing a pallid Christoph Waltz imitation)... which was Tarantino's first film; set inside a warehouse with a group of crooks while one holds a secret that can change everything... and Agatha Christie...And why it would be nearly impossible to sit through this a second time - EIGHT is a bonafide whodunit, especially during the third and final act where the tables twist and turn so much, you'll wonder if all the previous dialogue and dialogue-driven, camera-wielding suspense was effectively good, bad or ugly since, like any Mystery-based vehicle, the end result makes everything else matter... and ultimately, in this case, nothing and no one matters much at all."

Which is Sad because it had one of my favorite actors, Kurt Russell and we all know that film is Death Proof.Fast forward 8 years and QT brings back Kurt for a frozen tale of who done it and what happens when you place 8 folks with differing personalities into the small confines of a haberdashery in the middle of a blizzard.Well scripted dialogue, great performances from Goggins, Russell and Jackson make this frozen tale worth repeated viewings.While I know it is not a direct sequel I view it as a loose sequel to Django of tales about the wild west and south.My only complaint, keeping this fil from getting a perfect 10 was the waste of the 70mm film system. It would have been better for Django than it was for The Hateful Eight"

Yet, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked Django Unchained I decided to cue up Netflix and give The Hateful Eight a shot.It didn't take long for me to realize I had a Tarantino flick on my hands. The first 30 minutes is the typical dialogue heavy stuff, the Tarantino blueprint. At one point about 45 minutes in I was so close to turning the movie off, but I stayed with it. It was just too much characters talking and nothing happening. I knew that at some point they would all be confined together in a cabin or house so I told myself to wait it out, perhaps it will get better. If these are my feelings to this point does it sound like a 10/10 movie?Jennifer Jason Leigh's character was a bright spot. She didn't say much but I thought her mannerisms and facial expressions were perfect. I think in a way she kept me in the movie to see what would happen to her. Kudos to the makeup team that successfully had her looking beat to hell.I was interested to see what would happen in Red Rock, but because it's a Tarantino movie they were never going to get there. All hell had to break loose first. The inevitable slaughter scene took place. Heads exploding, etc. I would have liked a little mystery twist at the end, but instead it was the girl just simply suspected of lying and so everyone dies.I think ending with reading Abraham Lincoln's letter was supposed to......what was it supposed to do again?If you're a Tarantino fan you'll probably(?) like this movie. If you're not, you probably won't. I gave this 5 stars because it was good enough for me to get through the almost 3 hours but not without me contemplating turning it off and also checking my phone and such during the movie.Meh."

But, of course, it's also somehow special, and in that way for which Tarantino is known: Create a scenario in which quiet deceptions and general moral ossifications are flung at high velocities against the wall, examine the data from the scattering, and draw your own moral conclusions.These are ordinary theatrics. The amazing thing is how Tarantino makes them compellingly ponderable, in real time, on the big screen. Yet again.I ""fault"" my rating by one star, but only because this doesn't exceed a very, very high-water mark set by Pulp Fiction.Check it out."

The story doesn't need to be overly complex but if you pay attention there are a ton of details to pick up on. Especially on a second viewing. There is violence but it's far from disgusting. It brings some exciting scenes to a one set film.I think this is one of Tarantino's best, similar to Reservoir Dogs.

" Very entertaining and a play in movie format
",0.7056,0.6864,2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Potentially the level of criticism comes from die hearted Tarantino fans who expected something different (Western inspired characters usually suggest bloodier scenes).Still, in my view this a masterfully created script which delivers - you feel you are in the room with the characters most of time, and fully engaged in their conundrum.The movie is very much driven by dialogue (less so by shooting which is perhaps a turnoff for some) and that is what make the script so good - despite not leaving the same scenario for most of the movie, you feel you are in a Cludo board game trying to tell apart the good from the bad guys, without even having a very obvious character to cheer on.This could work amazingly as a play but as here it is very well transported to film and throughout the inn scenes you are always looking for the characters' next move. You would say the tension is ""palpable"".Acting is as always on point although perhaps less demanding than in some other Taranto movies, that I can concerns.Overall a great movie which takes the Western type world and creates a murder mystery movie from it."

" Tarantino can (and has) done better than this.
",0.4404,0.977,2018-09-20 00:00:00,9,"I finally managed to watch ""The Hateful Eight"". I pretty much hyped myself up for this film (after all, Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors and screenwriters), and I even saw people saying that this is his best film since ""Pulp Fiction""... which is really saying a lot.Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of this film. I personally felt like Tarantino just tried to reimagine ""Reservoir Dogs"", but set it after the Civil War... and in the winter... and with racists... and a LOT less interesting.PROS:
The acting in this movie was pretty great overall. I will never say anything bad about Samuel L. Jackson. If he's in a movie, I'm in. If he's in a Tarantino movie, I don't have a choice. And in this movie, he's great as always.I also really liked Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Their relationship was kinda funny to see, even though she hits her multiple times (trust me, she deserves it) and is handcuffed to her the whole movie.
Walton Coggins was also pretty interesting to see on-screen.
As usual, the dialogue in the film was great. There was a lot of witty banter between characters that I thought was really interesting. CONS:
This movie did not have to be as long as it was. It was 2 hours 28 minutes (I saw it on Netflix, so it didn't include the 15 minute intermission) long, and it unfortunately stretched its story thin throughout the film's runtime. And frankly, it kinda sucked.The overall twist was kinda lame and anticlimatic. Of course, I'm not going to spoil it for anybody who wants to watch it. All I'll say is that I didn't like it.Overall, this is the only Tarantino film I've watched (haven't seen ""Jackie Brown"" yet) that I would NOT like to watch another time. All of his other films are so much better than this.
If I had to rank his films from worst to best (excluding ""Jackie Brown"", ""Sin City"", and ""Death Proof""), it would be ""The Hateful Eight"", ""Kill Bill: Vol 2"", ""Django Unchained"", ""Kill Bill: Vol 1"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and then ""Pulp Fiction""."

With both of our leading men (the now hitmen) transporting their valuable bodies (some alive and some not), they are quite warry of one another however they still decide to travel together in a brutal Colorado blizzard. As the story progresses these two hit men along their way pickup an additional straggler known as the mayor of Red Rock a Mr. Sheriff Chris Mannix played by Walton Goggins. When the blizzard becomes to brutal to travel in the stagecoach of men find themselves in a local stagecoach lodge owned by a character that goes by the name of Minnie played by Dana Gourrier. During the groups stay at the Colorado stagecoach lodge, a story begins to unfold with conflict among the characters that involves many metaphors, nonlinear story telling moments, and even a mysterious poisoning. Samuel L. Jackson playing Major Marquis Warren a civil war veteran, who was pen pals with president Lincoln, introduces the first of many life ending conflicts with General Sandy Smithers portrayed by Bruce Dern after murdering his son in a form self-justified life preservation when hunted by the generals son for a bounty. As the story continues to unfold the viewer continues to learn more and more about Kurt Russell's character John Ruth and his bounty on Daisy Domergue played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Soon information is revealed to us that Daisy has refuge at this particular stagecoach lodge. Flashing backing in time we learn that her brother Jody Domergue portrayed by Channing Tatum, has taken over Minnie's lodge in order to save his sister from the hangman Oswaldo Mobary played by Tim Roth; telling us that the characters we have met, are not truly who they claim to be. As the story continues to unfold we learn how the scene has been set for John's success to free his sister and the true nature of each and every character that we meet in the Colorado lodge. The hateful eight is a story that focus on characters and their development as the story is told. The film shows that people are not always what they tell you they are, nor what they seem they are. Even towards the last minutes of the film we end with a metaphoric resolve of the death of Daisy Domergue we see the sheriff hang our main protagonist as we think she is going to live, for the last time in the film showing us people and their paths are not what we always think they are going to be."

Kurt Russell is the bounty hunter John Ruth who brings her by stagecoach to Minnie's haberdashery. There are wonderful performances like Bruce Dern and Samuel L. Jackson. The film is broken into chapters and is set up like a mystery. It can be crude, violent, vulgar and bloody but it's the wild wild west in the 1800s.

" Tarantino Continues His Streak
",0.0,0.8455,2018-08-29 00:00:00,9,"With Tarantino's ninth film, he returns to the Western genre and brings his signature wit, tension, and violence in a film that ranks as one of his best. While it does not have the sympathetic characters that some of his previous films have, it is an undeniably fun film.Essentially a remake of The Thing, The Hateful Eight takes place during a terrible blizzard where a group of sleazy characters have all been forced to hide out in a small inn. One of the individuals is on the way to be hanged but it quickly becomes apparent that someone is not who they claim to be and the picture turns into a classic mystery.The first thing that is noticeable about The Hateful Eight is the direction and the atmosphere. It's rare to see a western film in the snow-capped mountains and Hateful Eight uses this to gorgeous effect. The tone of the film is set almost immediately with a beautiful, haunting score by Ennio Morricone over a stark, snowy landscape. The film goes for a tone and it nails it from the first frame all the way to the last.As is typical with Tarantino films, the acting is perfect across the board. Each actor has been carefully selected for their roles and it shows. Dramatic tension is undercut with comedy at the drop of a hat and it never feels out of place, thanks to the performances. Samuel L. Jackson, as always, is at the top of his game, showing that even after 150 films, he is just as good as the script he has. Walton Goggins proves to be the highlight of the film and our perceptions of him constantly change throughout the film.Where the film truly shines is the dialogue, characters, and the tension that builds from both. Tarantino proves that age hasn't slowed him down one bit, in fact showing that he has become a master of his craft. In a lot of films, dialogue is meant to get us from one place to other, but in Tarantino's films, the dialogue is the highlight. They develop the characters and give us a plethora of quotable lines. We understand the characters which in turn makes the climax more interesting, because we are invested in what happens.Hitchcock said that the most exciting part of an action scene is not the gunshot, but what leads up to the gunshot. Hateful Eight is the perfect example of this and is the definition of a slow build. Since this is a Tarantino film, we know that something bad is going happen, we just don't know when, where, or why. As the film progressed, I was on the edge of my seat from one scene to the next. In rare form for Tarantino, the film has a deep political message that is incredibly topical today. The post-Civil War setting enhances the racial tensions and there is more than one scene addressing race in America that is still relevant today. While it is not a focal point of the film, it adds another layer to a movie that is full of them,While the length may be an issue for some, I didn't even notice it. I was engaged from beginning to end with The Hateful Eight and the three-hour runtime felt like two.Hateful Eight is required viewing for fans of the crime and western genre. If you have even a remote interest in Tarantino films, then you've probably already seen Hateful Eight. If not, then take a few hours out of your day to watch a future classic."

Now, just because it's my favorite movie doesn't mean it doesn't have flaws. Yes, it's kinda long, that's to be expected with Tarantino. And the flashback to how the habedashery was set up can get a little annoying rewatching the movie. But thats about it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I strongly, STRONGLY suggest you should watch it without thinking that it's going to be action packed.

Seriously shocked at how many low ratings this has received as it is definitely better than of the over hyped block busters that are released on a monthly basis."
" A wasted opportunity?
",-0.1027,-0.8992,2018-08-04 00:00:00,6,"Before seeing the hateful eight, if you were to offer me a Tarantino movie, set in western times about a group of characters trapped inside a cabin and having to bounce off each other with signature Tarantino dialogue and writing, I would have bitten your hand off! Unfortunately, the Hateful Eight doesn't get good until the second half of the movie, where Samuel L Jackson delivers an iconic, hilarious monologue that rivals the likes of Jules' ""vengeance"" speech in pulp fiction. After this point, the Tarantino-isms truly kick into gear, and the suspense, the wit, the gore, and the characters truly shining and being some of Tarantino's best work, with Warren and Mannix being the stand-outs. However, what makes this film so frustrating is the incredibly tiresome, boring, and irrelevant first half, which definitely should have been cut down, not only to make the film better over all, but to increase the rewatch value. Out of all the Tarantino movies I've seen so far, I feel I am least likely to revisit this one, with its nearly 3 hour run time and monotonous first half, which feels like another writer trying to imitate Tarantino's style, rather than an actual Tarantino movie. If you were to take one thing from this review, I would say completely skip the first hour and 20 minutes or so to where Samuel L Jackson delivers a speech about his ""big black pecker"" and watch the chaos from there! But because of that first half, I feel the Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's weaker projects, or at the very least the most frustrating."
" The Problem Here...
",-0.4019,0.9489,2018-08-01 00:00:00,7,"... Is that Tarantino over-rated the main protagonists' charm. After we see the ""good guys"" beat cuffed women, we kind of root for the ""bad guys"", who are much more sympathetic, even after the saloon's previous massacre.A special comment on Leigh, that offers an astounding performence as a white trash desperado - she also sings quite well. She blew me away, and is now one of my favorite actress. Excellent casting choice for Tarantino. The other actors are all doing fine.This is, without any doubt, an excellent movie that will become a classic. Yes, there's too much ""Tarantian racism"", but even then, it isn't out of place with the context. This is a movie that slowly goes down like a glass of brandy near the fireplace."
" Waste of my time
",-0.4215,-0.1386,2018-07-30 00:00:00,3,It was like watching the Resivor Dogs set back in the older days. I enjoyed the Resivor Dogs but didn't care for a redo and this movie is basically that. Just a redo set in a different time.
" Completely forgettable
",0.0,-0.7668,2018-07-28 00:00:00,4,I'm only reviewing this pile of garbage because it has way too high of a rating. It is 3 hours long but the events in the movie are so slow that it was unnecessary to make it so long. Tarantino randomly starts narrating in parts of it because it's so boring that you forget what is even happening. You know those murder mystery rooms you can get locked in with your friends? This is basically a movie about going to one of those places but less interesting.
" Long introduction then a mystery starts (for short time!)
",0.0,0.9166,2018-07-26 00:00:00,3,I saw this movie recently after a recommendation.. I didn't know what is about except it is in the old west during winter with characters that seems to be rough!!So.. Almost two third of the movie was an introduction to most of the characters.. some of them were little easy to understand or at least with obvious and clear intentions.. the others were not easy to pick up what their intentions.. that introduction was slow and detailed a little. Afterward things escalated for short time and then a slow reveal of a main mystery (that the viewer might not aware of!!) that used pieces of information that the viewer wasn't aware of as well or easy to miss in long dialogues.. at the end there was an extreme tension and the viewer will make speculations (even after the movie finishes!). It is a enjoyable movie to watch (and hear!). The capture of the winter atmosphere was superb (but most of the scenes were inside a cabin).. and the main acting staff were a core attraction for this movie for their capabilities to show us the essence of the characters before the clear reveal of every one's intention. The plot wasn't hard to absorb but the long dialogues can make some viewers lose interest and focus as most of the fast and light action happen near the end of the movie!
" Wildly entertaining thanks to the screenplay, but not the finest of Tarantino's work.
",0.4404,-0.8691,2018-07-25 00:00:00,6,"The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's eighth film (considering Kill Bill Vo. 1 and Vol. 2 as a single film). As expected, this is a highly dialogue driven movie, especially the first half of the movie. You can feel the tension in the air, given the backdrop. It takes place sometime after the American Civil War, hence the insecurities. I've got to applaud the director for the first half of the movie. It's directed superbly and acted out superbly. It's probably one of those films in which nothing nerve wrecking happens, yet it keeps you on the edge of your seat (I'm simply speaking of the first half). As the second half unfolds, you see this movie turning into a classic crime drama, with thousands of questions in your mind. And mind you, classic in the more traditional sense. But that is not necessarily a good thing. As a short story, that would have been great. It seems to lose its focus, especially in the last two chapters. I wasn't a big fan of the 'explanation' to what the hell was happening. It just stuck onto the norms of similar films. Disregarding the actual plot, this is a wildly entertaining movie. The ensemble cast is great, the cinematography is top notch and the conversations between the characters are intense. Disliking each and every character is a special thing about The Hateful Eight. Some would find the movie wildly entertaining (myself included) but not the best. Others would see this as an instant classic and one of Tarantino's best. Just a matter of personal opinion. But we can all agree upon the classic screenplay in the first half and the gorgeous cinematography."
" Very involving!
",0.0,0.9055,2018-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Now, I'm not writing this review to be ""helpful"". I'm just voicing my opinion on it as a whole. I stumbled upon this title on Netflix with hardly any knowledge of it, the actors involved, or even its plot. The beginning was somewhat strange, but the setting was somewhat immersive to me, so I stuck with watching it. As the plot thickened and the characters became more involved with each other, I found it kind of hard to get out of my seat for the nearly 3 hours that the movie was on.The suspenseful events that unfold during the movie (especially when it came down to the mystery aspect) really kept my mind focused, and got me involved with the character portrayal and each of their roles in this tiny cabin that most of it takes part in. The gruesome and ""expected-but-unexpected"" things that happen during this film didn't distract me from the rest of the plot, and kept engaged and focusing on what would happen next. I will say that if you're just looking for a shoot-em-up western that involves a team of heroes, this is not a movie meant for you. If you can grasp hold of what's going on in the film and take the tiny details into consideration given the fact that it's a mystery that revolves heavily around the characters, I think you'll like the movie."
" You love it or hate it. But that's a classic!
",0.1386,0.9528,2018-07-21 00:00:00,10,"If you have an IQ above the avarege and have a taste of cinema; you will love that movie. But if you are a fan of ""Fast and Furious 5"" style movie fan; please dont bother to watch. Because this is the real cinema; you will feel the Sergio's soul and you will taste ""The Unforgiven-1992"" or ""The Magnificent Seven-1960"" or ""The Big Country-1958"". This is pure classic western and in my opinion far better than Django. 10/10Thank you Tarantino"
" Tarantino's delightfully twisted western tale.
",0.5719,0.2238,2018-07-18 00:00:00,8,"8.5 out of 10 for clarification. The Hateful Eight continues Quentin Tarantino's trend of historical films by immersing the viewer in post civil war Wyoming to weave the bloody tale of strangers meeting up in a remote cabin during a blizzard. Tarantino's signature use of varied and extravagant characters is present here, and on the whole the excellent performances match these abstract personalities. Similarly, his use of extensively bloody, stylised violence is just as effective and compelling as in Pulp Fiction and the film retains his distinctive non linear plot structure. Also, the score is considered but not as compelling as the excellent soundtracks featured in in his previous films. The film gains momentum and peaks during the spectacular final act. However, the lack of his trademark sharp and quotable dialogue is a distressing omission that threatens to jeopardize his 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Overall, The Hateful eight marks a slight decline in quality from Tarantino's most impressive efforts (Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction), but is still an accomplished film"
" Fantastic Tarentino film!
",0.5983,0.9971,2018-07-09 00:00:00,10,"I haven't seen many Tarentino films, only the two Kill Bills and now this one, but I can say that if all the rest of his films are like this one, then I'm forever a fan. This is a fantastic film, it does everything right. The storytelling and the acting is what really stands out here. This film is told in chapters, and each chapter is essential to the overall story. Samuel L. Jackson gives an incredible performance here, ofcourse he never phones it in, but this performance is especially strong. The other one that really shines here is Jennifer Jason Leigh, she really shows her great acting abilities here as Daisy. Very deserving of that Academy Award nomination. The other cast members do great too, very focused and committed. The film is a claustrophobic western mystery film. I love that the film is vague and doesn't give you much to go off of. I was thoroughly entertained and never bored. How could I be bored with such great writing and such great acting? 10/10!"

" Fantastic Characters and Writing, NOT an Action Flick
",0.5574,0.9947,2018-07-03 00:00:00,10,"Ok real talk, anybody giving this movie anything under a 5 is absolutely tripping balls, the kind of person who only watches Fast and Furious and Triple X, and thinks that movies like The Purge and 50 Shades of Grey are classics and standards for storytelling. How can this movie be under average, even when judged purely by ""was I entertained or not?"" Movies like The Room are rated 3-4, and yet this high quality film is getting 1-3 stars. WTF.As for my 10/10, I understand that raises skepticism, but what it comes down to for me, like all of you, is whether I was highly entertained or not, and for me to be entertained I need great dialogue and great characters. And this movie has fantastic characters and fantastic dialogues. And every moment throughout this movie I was captivated and wanted to know what was going to happen next. AND, it is NOT predictable. This movie navigates the complex space of 8+ characters whose fates have overlapped in a small outpost during a blizzard, and as the story unfolds so do, in parallel, the complex personalities and relationships these characters have with each other. For some pasts are intertwined, for others the future, and for everyone the present. Not one of these characters is good or bad, they are just people with their own motives, life experiences and understandings. I think that those people saying that there are strong political undertones in this movie, they are just projecting and it's something they've carried with themselves into this viewing experience. I did not even think there was anything like that until I read some reviews on here. All I saw a story told in a snapshot of time.Highly recommend this movie -- reserve an evening, put your phones and distractions away, turn the lights and noises off, and hit the play button."
" Tarantino is as skillful as he is sadistic
",0.0,0.024,2018-07-01 00:00:00,7,"In the wild west shortly after the U.S. Civil War, an oddball gang of characters end up sharing space in a stagecoach lodge during a wicked Wyoming blizzard. They include bounty hunters, a wanted murderer, an alleged sheriff, an alleged hangman, a former Confederate general, and other mysterious guests who arise suspicion. The movie is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.In regard to movie storytelling and execution, I have little doubt that Tarantino is a genius. I also have little doubt that he is a sadist.His films can end up with different results depending on how much the mean-spirited violence overwhelms his brilliance. When the violence was minimal (that is, in Tarantino terms), the brilliance clearly won out with the creation of such great films as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", and ""Django Unchained"".Then, there were the two movies in the ""Kill Bill"" series where the violence was often sickening and overwhelming. This situation recurs in ""The Hateful Eight"".Firstly, the pluses of which there are many:With the aid of music by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Robert Richardson, Tarantino succeeds in evoking a hell-on-earth created by its inhabitants.Storywise, there are many moments of mystery, plot twists, suspense, and extended moments of tense dialogue. While Tarantino's stories are always filled with violence, they are always engaging. And most of all, compared to many other screenwriters, his stories are always understandable. They can be complex without being confusing.There are two frequents sources of criticism about this movie but I will actually come to the movie's defense. One is that the movie is too long especially in the middle. I agree that it could have been shortened but the tension was always present in the middle scene leading the viewer to believe (rightly so) that this was only a build-up.The other criticism was against the inclusion of a scene that is a flashback. I felt this scene added to the film's impact. It helped solve the mystery of the backgrounds of some of the characters. It also allowed us to see other characters who had previously been spoken of only in reference. The best part of the scene is that it provided us with kind and friendly characters who interacted well with others. This was a welcome respite from the uniformly vile characters that infested the movie's first half.And the acting is great. Standout performances come from Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Bruce Dern.It's in the end when things get overly brutal and mean-spirited especially the fate of one character who had already been subject to an excess of degradation. The act itself and the image of its aftermath were hard to get out of my mind well after the movie's end. I guess it's now time for a schlocky rom-com to rebalance my senses."

" Just relax and enjoy!
",0.75,-0.9175,2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,"The Hateful Eight - is the eighth film by Quentin Tarantino. After the stunning success of the Tarantino's Django Unchained, Quentin presented us the new story, where events unfold after the American Civil War.The movie starts from beautiful views of Wyoming plains. The bounty hunter John Ruth is escorting the female criminal person Daisy Domergue to Red Rock. The carriage is driven by O.B., experienced coachman. In the trip, John picks up another bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (Afro-American) and Chris Mannix, who called himself new sheriff of Red Rock. The weather is very bad. For covering from the blizzard, they arrive to the Minnie's Haberdashery. But they discover that Minnie is missing there. Instead of her they meet several other people: a Mexican Bob - the temporary owner, Oswaldo Mobray - a hangman, Joe Gage - a cowboy and Sanford Smithers - the retired Confederate general. All 9 people have to stay under the same roof. However the fact is that almost all of them have very bad actions in the past. Some of them were enemies in the Civil War, and they try to provoke each other. Bad the main problem is that someone has introduced himself as another person. Who wants to free Daisy and kill all of the rest? Compared with Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight doesn't have a lot of action. However, the viewer can enjoy the slow narration, interesting dialogues, and gradually increasing tension between all characters - all things that we love in Tarantino movies. The actor play is perfect: Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins and Jennifer Jason Leigh - everyone is in the right place. I strongly recommend The Hateful Eight to all Western lovers."
" Interesting though overly long
",0.4019,-0.9662,2018-06-17 00:00:00,6,"The Hateful Eight is set in Wyoming in the years after the Civil War, as bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) takes his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) into a remote haberdashery to wait out an impending blizzard. Along the way, he picks up Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a former Union Army officer who has also gone into the bounty hunting trade. The company they find at the store turns out to be a bunch of killers, all hiding their own agendas.This film is quite interesting within its engaging dialogue and scenery but does drag on at certain points. With a running time of 2 hours 48 minutes, it does get quite overlong and boring at certain points and was slightly difficult in watching and staying away for the entire film. There are good characters which does make the film work, as Samuel L. Jackson is in typical form as he helps carries the film, along with Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walter Goggins who steals his scenes.Overall, the Hateful Eight isn't an easy film to digest as it is violent, offers a lot of imagery and contains a little amount of action, with much talking. Such as all Quentin Tarantino films, this isn't for everyone."

Ty BarronThe Hateful Eight is a western cinematographic masterpiece not for the faint of heart. Quentin Tarantino has been a polarizing presence in the film industry since hitting the scene with his first big movie, Reservoir Dogs, in 1992. Since then, he has solo directed and released nine movies each as polarizing as the next, and along the way has carved his own style into the world of film. Tarantino's most recent release, The Hateful Eight, is two hours and forty-seven minutes full of intricate interwoven plots with many moving pieces, a good deal of humor, and of course in classic Tarantino fashion, an abundance of violence. The film's cast stars familiar faces with pieces of Tarantino's trademark ensemble cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern. It also includes marvelous performances from younger actress Jennifer Jason Leigh and actor Channing Tatum who play sister and brother. The entirety of the movie takes place during a blizzard in Wyoming a few years after the Civil War, mainly in a haberdashery where eight strangers stay the night waiting for the storm to pass. Kurt Russell plays John The Hangman Ruth, a bounty hunter taking the prized murderer, Daisy Domergue played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, to Red Rock Wyoming on the other side of the mountain during the blizzard when they come across Samuel L. Jackson's character, Major Marquis Warren, coincidentally another bounty hunter, stranded in the storm. A little ways later the group comes across the self proclaimed new sheriff of Red Rock Chris Mannix, played by Walton Goggins, stuck in the storm as well. Including the stagecoach driver, the four seek shelter in the haberdashery where four other men already reside. Each character has a mysterious story and they soon learn that things may not be quite as they appear.Many people will criticize the movie for having only one true female character. The treatment of the character Daisy Domergue in the movie does not help as she is constantly bloodied and literally chained to Kurt Russell's wrist, perhaps Tarantino is hinting at something larger here with the handcuffs as well. However, she is the true fire of the plot as everything that happens in the film revolves around her. Tarantino has received backlash in the past for sexist characters however in movies such as Kill Bill: Volume 1, Kill Bill: Volume 2, and now The Hateful Eight, he has shown that female characters are the equivalent to the male characters in his movies as their roles are important lead ones that could really be played by a man or a woman and there would be no difference in the overall movie. Additionally, the gender of Daisy is never even explicitly brought up or explored as her role in the grand scheme of things is so much larger. The writing of the film is exquisite as Samuel L. Jackson's Major Marquis Warren bares strikingly similar personality traits to his character Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction. It is almost as if Jules Winnfield hopped in a time machine and was transported to the years following the civil war with the identity of Major Warren. Just like in Pulp Fiction, Jackson's character is quick-witted, cunning, and a definite sharp shooter. Those who are fans of Tarantino's work in Pulp Fiction will most certainly find themselves quickly in love with the character of Major Marquis Warren. Furthermore there were rumors that Tarantino originally wanted The Hateful Eight to be a sequel to Django Unchained which certainly would have been intriguing, however he realized that it would not work. This may have been for the better though because if that was the case then the entire audience would have been missing Samuel L. Jackson's magnificent performance which is the pure magic of the movie and it is as if he was born to play this role. What really makes the movie is the location and setting. The constant blizzard and the warm haberdashery in the middle of nowhere provides a highly unique cozy, yet mysterious feel. The true genius of the film is the fact that it takes place all in one room, with primarily only eight characters. With flashbacks, there is a total count of sixteen character appearances in the film but mostly, as the title implies, there are only eight real characters. The single location and few characters make the movie feel more like a magnificent stage play in all the right ways. The isolation allows the audience to become lost in the film and get sucked into feeling that they are right there in the haberdashery themselves. The elongated dialogue between characters helps to facilitate this feeling as each word is skillfully written to each character and captivates the audience dying to hear what is coming next. At the end of the day this is still a Tarantino movie, and a phenomenal one at that. The pure visual aspect of the film is unparalleled and out of this world. From the majestic horses in the thick, bright, white snow storm to the blood splattered lodge, everything is done in artistic perfection. The opening scene is a beautiful wide angle pan shot of the vast mountainous area of Wyoming and then transitions to a close up shot that zooms out on a statue of Jesus Christ on the Cross, covered in snow in the middle of the frozen tundra. The juxtaposition of the gorgeous landscape with the statue of a frozen Christ is an excellent demonstration of Tarantino's unique approach to film as he constantly places something stunning and divine next to something more ominous and darker, allowing the later to be projected in a light equal to the beauty of its counterpart. While at times it can be a bloody mess, it is a beautiful mess. The inordinance of violence and blood is expected when walking into a Quentin Tarantino directed movie. The borderline gore adds to the masterful cinematographic work of the film and makes it an art piece all on its own. The plot is sophisticated, the violence is over the top, and the characters are wicked. The movie is everything an audience member wants. So far from reality, yet so dangerously close at the same time. Full of bounty hunters, hangmen, cowboys, union and confederate soldiers, gang members the film has everything that excites and sends shocking chills up the spine while keeping the viewer on their toes for its entirety.Rating: 9"
" A superb western with a twist!
",0.6588,0.8335,2018-06-01 00:00:00,10,"Tarantino's second western is slower paced than his first(Django Unchained), but it makes up for it by bringing a collection of great characters together in an isolated space and being a ""whodunnit"". Seeing the different characters interact and the tension rise is a treat indeed! The dialogue is king in a movie like this, and Tarantino is the master of that."

It was part western (good half) part murder mystery (great half).

" The Hateful Eight review
",-0.4939,-0.991,2018-05-20 00:00:00,1,"As I was leaving a movie theatre, I did not know if I have been to a cinema or a butchery. The last film of Quentin Tarantino is incredibly brutal. In fact it is all about killing and nothing else. In addition it lasts as many as three hours and seven minutes.
 To begin with, I will discuss the plot. The eight of bad people meet accidentally in tiny roadside inn. Some of them are criminals, the others are head-hunters. As a result of a terrible snowstorm they are all stuck. Soon they start to kill each other. Awful. That is the plot.
 The movie does not differ much from others of Tarantino. It got some top prizes like an Oscar. Main characters are played by some famous actors. The soundtrack was composed by Ennio Morricone. The Hateful Eight is the first western, since Sergio Leone's productions, that has been decorated with his music.
 All in all, the motion picture is definitely not worth watching for the reason that there is nothing pretty about it. Moreover, even if there was any secret message between the lines, it is impossible to get it because of overwhelming brutality of the composition. I would not recommend it to anyone, even my worst enemies."
" Could have been shorter
",0.0,0.9279,2018-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Typical Tarantino movie, divided into different chapters, flashback and a climax.
With all that avoidable gore in second half, something tells me this guy is a big fan of Horror genre. Only he doesn't make much Horror movies but adds some horror spice with all that gore.
A bullet shot to head with some distance, will kill you, but not blow away your skull like a pumpkin, splattering all insides out. Except for a few flaws the movie is good and enjoyable. 
Like John Ruth, when he first vomited blood and Daisy was thumping her arms on desk like she knew something was going to happen, he should have shot her there itself. That was no time to play an idealistic hangman. Instead he got shot by Daisy. Samuel L Jackson's character, Warren, was the smartest of all. Also he was very well acquainted with Minnie's place. So he should have known that there is a basement there. He and John Ruth, when they were disarming everyone, he should have told him about basement and they should have checked it out. Also, he was suspicious of Bob the Mexican right from first. Perhaps he knew that something happened to Minnie and others there. Still he didn't checked out the basement. 
And he should have shot all three Bob, Joe and Oswaldo at the same time. After seeing what happened to John Ruth and OB, there was no question that it is a set up. Sheriff was a sheriff in waiting and himself came close to drinking that coffee. 
Warren should have used Daisy as a hostage to lure out her brother or any other accomplices.End, when they hang Daisy, Warren got his balls shot and could barely move or walk and Mannix also was shot in leg and could barely walk. Yet they were able to hang her or wanted to hang her. A bullet to head would have been more practical and also feasible. Movie is enjoyable, but should have been a bit shorter. If you you want to watch it again, obviously its length would be a deterrent."
" An ominous and pervasively tense chamber piece; Tarantino's best work in years.
",0.1027,-0.743,2018-05-14 00:00:00,8,"'The Hateful Eight (2016)' is Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction by far, an ominous chamber piece that's slow-paced yet utterly captivating. Even its loose, strange and ultimately wholly unnecessary first carriage-confined hour is an entertaining experience, though it pales in comparison to what happens when we arrive at the cabin. There are no traditional heroes, no-one's intention's are clear and their morals are dubious at best. A pervasive tension builds throughout, ultimately keeping you on the edge-of-your-seat until it reaches its explosively violent, cruel and oddly inevitable climax. Its only real flaw is the way it conforms to the director's odd need to use a partially non-linear narrative, even when it really doesn't add anything to the plot and actually slows it down significantly. 8/10"
" What makes Tarantino great
",0.6249,0.972,2018-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Tarantino is perhaps the most important director of our generation. And when he makes a film you have to go see it. Most QT fans including me have been often at a loss of words to explain that what is so great about his movies. His films are about shallow people doing shallow things, highly stylized and lack any real social/political messages or even insights into human behavior. They are well....pulp fiction. Much in the same vein is his eighth film - The Hateful Eight(THE). It has all the elements of vintage Tarantino - stylized violence, bad language, Excessive use of the n word, expressive dialogues, Mexican stand offs, 'cue cool music', red apple cigarettes (this time tobacco) and yes...Samuel L Jackson. While watching THE I finally realized what is it that makes QT great or the legend that he is. Let me explain with a scene. Sam Jackson's character hands a letter from Abe Lincoln to Kurt Russell. As Kurt reads from the letter the glow from the letter lights up his face. This is not actual glow but the sheer yellow tinge that the letter throws up on his face. This is old school film making done exceptionally well. It's as if someone saw all possible forms of cinema ever shot in this world and decided to take the best parts and then make their movie. The result has to be gold. And The Hateful Eight very much is.The plot is simple - a bounty hunter called as the Hangman is taking a notorious gangster (Jennifer Jason Leigh in an Oscar worthy performance) to hang in the town of Red Rock. On his way he meets another familiar bounty hunter who is stranded and a mysterious guy who claims to be the next sheriff of Red Rock. The 4 of them then head to a haberdashery only to meet 4 other strangers who all don't seem to be who they claim to be.
So the eight + the stagecoach driver are now stuck together in this house while a blizzard unleashes outside. One by one as expected things begin to go wrong. The film has not much of a political message as some critics have enthused it to have. Nor does it have any social messages. It is plain old pulp fiction told so entertainingly that you will not realise it has a 3 hour + running time. QT fans dont miss it. QT haters never too late to convert. Catch it on the big screen in 70 MM Panavision :)"
" Worst movie I've seen in 10 years

The story is terrible and the title should be the hateful 10 as there were actually 10 people at the cabin. The thing I noticed most was the bad acting, there are about 6 giant stars in this movie and its almost like they forgot how to act? Also the music sounded like it was picked by a five-year-old child. A truly disappointing movie and two-hours of my life I'll never get back (sad face)."

Even as a premise, this strikes one more as a stage play than as a film. And the confined spaces and dialogue-reliant plot only further detract from any cinematic experience. A stagecoach stops to pick up a potential passenger. A long dialogue exchange ensues. Then there is another passenger, and another long exchange. Then the four passengers in the stagecoach have a long conversation. They finally arrive at the layover station, where four more travellers await them, and lots and lots of long conversations. This endless jabbering is bad enough, except it is not very funny or dramatic. It's all a bit bland. Samuel L. Jackson going on tediously about stew, long past the mark where everyone got the point, is one egregious example. It is also symptomatic of how the audience is either way ahead and waiting for the film to catch up, or 'surprised' by some revelation that we don't really care about. In sum, this is one of the worst scripts to make it to film in decades."
" Nail it shut

The people there are in natural conflict with each other as they fought on both sides of the Civil War.Without ruining the plot, the 9 characters are:1) Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) is a bounty hunter. He was three dead people with him. He fought in the Civil War and has a reputation among southerners who placed a bounty on him. He carries with him a personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Everyone distrusts him because he is black...or that other word they use.
2) John ""the hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) is another bounty hunter. He has with him a live $10,000 bounty and is paranoid about people wanting to take her.
3) Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the bounty. She is very unlady like and frequently gets punched in the mouth.
4) Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) is the son of a southern raider. He claims he is on his way to Red Rock to be its new sheriff. No one believes him either.
5) Bob (Demian Bichir) is a Mexican who cares for Minnie's Haberdashery while Minnie is away visiting her mom. Warren distrusts him from the start.
6) Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) is a nice cultured Brit on his way to Red Rock to be the hangman.
7) Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) is a cowpoke trying to get back home. Pretty much keeps to himself.
8) General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a confederate general known to Major Warren. He tries to be quiet. He is in Wyoming to create a grave marker for his missing son, presumed dead.
9) OB Jackson (James Parks) is the stage coach driver and most likely is not part of the titled 8, but he is there anyway.This is typical Quentin Tarantino.

",0.0,-0.9853,2018-03-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie is creatively written, I'm not going to lie. Tarantino does a masterful job of making you care just enough about even minor characters to make their senselessly graphic deaths even more grating. If you ""enjoyed"" this movie you should probably go to therapy. It's not always a bad thing for a movie to leave you feeling unsatisfied, especially if it has an important message. This movie did not. It was 168 minutes of crafting the most painful, gruesome, disturbing, deaths that it possibly could. For no other reason than to leave the audience either reveling in gore and horror, or, for those of us with a degree of consciousness, in a numb state of shock. We have this idea in western art-culture that immoral attitudes and actions are ok if they're done for art. Why? I've never heard even a half baked argument for this philosophy but it's common place amongst artists, film makers, and comedians. Tasteless is tasteless whether it's from the misogynistic drunk at the bar or the comedian on screen. There's no virtue in rebellion. Commuting sexual acts on a person for money is called prostitution and is considered shameful but if it's for art then ""oh wow! The courage! The bravery!!"". It's asinine. Prostituting your body for money is immoral whether it's done in real life or on camera. It's the same with celebrating darkness and pointless violence. Morbid fantasies are gross and should be avoided not celebrated, whether they're the act of an actual killer or a director. To try to argue otherwise is simply to excuse our own perverse curiosity as an audience."

It is true that the movie demands a considerable effort for comprehension and seeing the length, those who miss the main thematic point are doomed to be disappointed. Well, the final song sums it up pretty well in fact. When you make war, you are probably to get yourself killed. So did all the characters. Had they stood a chance in the first place ? Yes I guess, at least one of them : the old veteran. He did what he could but the provocation got just beyond what he could stand. In fact, on a second thought he may as well ignore it, the experienced though guy he is. Nevertheless, as Oswaldo says : Gentlemen, I know Americans aren't apt to let a little thing like unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war...Now that we dealt with the very nature of war, let's look at another issue brought up by the movie : The nature of justice. At this point, I find it useful to resort once again to Oswaldo's lines : "" Oswaldo Mobray: John Ruth wants to take you back to Red Rock to stand trial for murder. And, if... you're found guilty, the people of Red Rock will hang you in the town square. And as the hangman, I will perform the execution. And if all those things end up taking place, that's what civilized society calls ""justice"". However, if the relatives and the loved ones of the person you murdered were outside that door right now. And after busting down that door, they drug you out in the snow and hung you up by the neck, that, we would be frontier justice. Now the good part about frontier justice, is it's very thirst quenching. The bad part is it's apt to wrong as right!John 'The Hangman' Ruth: Not in your case. In your case, you'd probably have it comin'. But other people, maybe not so much!Oswaldo Mobray: But ultimately what's the real difference between the two? The real difference is me, the hangman. To me, it doesn't matter what you did. When I hang you, I will get no satisfaction from your death, it's my job! I hang you in Red Rock, I move on to the next town, I hang someone else there. The man who pulls the lever that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man. And that dispassion is the very essence of justice. For justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice.John 'The Hangman' Ruth: Amen! ""Hence, for justice to be made in an honest way, it should be delivered by a law man. For law man, we had Chris the new sheriff. As the story approached its culminating point, he and Marquis Warren got ""in kahoots"". Which was surprising. Who in that little haberdashery got more reasons to hate each other ? But I guess it was the shared dignity of being ""soldiers"" not just random busters that got them together. Well, as far-fetched an idea as it may seem to some, I believe one could see there an apology to the old good days when ennemies knew how to exchange cigarettes and get friendly-like; as opposed oblivously the today's world that conventions of old times have deserted long ago. Chris and Marquis sealed the veracity of their status as lawful men by hanging Domergue, just as a law man par excellence would do. In a nutshell, from a dramatic point of view, it was a clever plot and eventhough I generally dislike long movies, this one I regard as an artistic preference. Now, from a cinematographic point of view, I very much liked the gloomy yet snow-white atmosphere. Tarantino does his job and he does it duly. This movie is not garbage. It opens with the isolated and snow-covered cross. So be ready to make some effort to get something out of it."

The Hateful Eight uses everything I love in a film, all in one, from the realism in dialogue, to the gore and blood, there is nothing quite like a Tarantino (Director/Writer) film! From the beginning we are introduced uniquely to characters through John Ruth's (Kurt Russel) carriage journey through a snowy wasteland, taking Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to hang at Blackrock for her crimes. As soon as Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) encounters John Ruth, we can immediately identify it is a Tarantino movie, through the use of heavy, intense and realistic dialogue. Although profane words are used throughout the film, with majority having a racist context, it shows us as an audience the lifestyle as an African American and a Caucasian American after the American Civil War. Throughout the movie there is so much tension that exists in that small compact bar, with events such as the poisoning of the tea to who killed Dave, which all leads up to the bloodbath we witness towards the end of the film, which was exhilarating! Along with the twists and mystery to what is occurring throughout the film, it kept me as an audience and as an aspiring filmmaker entertained for 3 hours, which is hard to do with modern films. The only downside to Hateful Eight was there wasn't as much action and gore as Tarantino's other films like Django Unchained, so due to this, I give it a 9/10! Worth the watch!"

" The Mr Clue of Westerns Tarantino Style
",0.0,0.777,2018-02-06 00:00:00,9,"The movie ""The Hateful Eight"" is set in a time period shortly after the civil war. A small group of travelers with a bounty hunter Kurt Russell (John Ruth), his driver James Parks (O.B.), with his prisoner Jennifer Leigh (Daisy Domergue) is out on the countryside of Wyoming and is trying to get to shelter before a great blizzard leaves them for dead in the freezing cold. Shortly after the start they run across a stranded bounty hunter on the run Samuel L Jackson (Major Marquis Warren) and the New Sheriff of Red Rock Walton Goggins (Sheriff Chris Mannix). They are all trying to get to a small cabin Minnie's Haberdashery, which is like a small bed and bath which is conveniently the last stop before getting to the main town of Red Rock, WY. 
As the come to the bed and bath where they are going to be in for a couple of days, things seemed to nice and quaint or are they? After being shacked up there in Minnie's Haberdashery for a couple of days some things become unraveled inside that shack especially after the owner is inconspicuously absent. Some of the other patrons that was part of the haberdashery had some of their true colors come out though out the movie. The major theme of this movie is that everything my not be what they seemed. So be careful viewer for what you may seemed to be the truth may not be. There are lies, untruths and deceit in this great action film. 
The Domergue gang is trying to link back up with Daisy, sister of Channing Tatum (Jody Domergue). The rest of the characters in the haberdashery are a long haired cowboy Michael Madsen (Joe Gage), a smooth talking British Tim Roth (Oswaldo Mobray), a Mexican helper Demian Bichir (Bob), and an old confederate general Bruce Dern (General Sandy Smithers). These characters are intertwined in an interesting story of some bounty hunters, town folk, and a treacherous gang almost as close to the same theme as ""Who kill Mr. Clue?""
Quentin Tarantino does a great job of telling his story by using flashbacks and character development in this movie. The use of flashback helps you get the back story in this movie. About halfway during the movie the viewer fully understands the story and how some of the characters may or may not show their hands to each other before we get into the gory action-packed movie Tarantino is known for. Tarantino also use of character development give you more clues about the intent or each character all the way through out movie especially when you finally find out the truth about the Abraham Lincoln Letters. This movie will keep you interested all the way to the end with its plot twist and deceit in this action pack instant classic. Sit back, relax but don't pass judgement to quickly you may or may not be wrong."

Tarantino is looking beyond the crown and it is inconceivable that Tarantino is looking for the Oscars. The academic prize may be of specific standards and adherence to it will help win the nomination and win. This is not a match for Tarantino. He defies the standards of his unbridled imagination and makes him in a traditional boxed frame. Tarantino is his talent.Genius Scenario ..
The clever scenario in The Hateful Eight takes the viewer on a thrilling three-hour trip reminiscent of the films produced in the mid-1960s by the Western Spring director Sergio Leone.
Dialogue here can never be predicted. Tarantino's clever, intelligent dialogue makes the viewer puzzled and inquired and then smoothly and pleasantly brings together the parties to the dialogue to come as viewers to the heart of the story without any sense of amazement in the story. It is difficult to find dialogue in the film going in one direction is a dialogue full of side texts outside the main story, which is no less in the beauty of the original text.Acting is one of the reasons for the film's success ..
In each scene, there is mutual creativity, especially actor Tim Roth, who mentioned us in this film in the manner and performance of actor Christopher Waltz, and as a friend told me that the role was originally for actor Waltz before that Now assigns to Tim Roth. Samuel Jackson's outstanding performance, especially in Tarantino's films, was also known as violence does not care for anyone who talks continuously without interrupting dialogues and if anger uses his weapon without hesitation.
Let's not forget the ideal choice of actor Kurt Russell as the prize hunter because the actor's character and his image are terribly suited to Western fashion and here lies the beauty of his choice of role.
Finally, actress Jennifer Jason, who was able to perform a performance that impressed many critics, represented a difficult role to play, a role full of brutality, indifference and even insult, yet she took this role assigned to her Oscar nomination.Enio Morikoni and the Sondtrak.
Since the film begins, you will be back in time for five decades, as if you were watching a sixties movie, and do not forget that he was the same person who made that music at that time.Moriconi takes you with the capsule of time to the past. Classic music at a quiet pace was only a prelude to an epic of musical interludes. The musical interludes are reminiscent of the grand piano. During the long conversation between Major Marquez and General Smithers, Daisy ""after the"" poison ""scene.
And most important of all is that wonderful music on the horse scene is dragging the cart, the lens of the output that focuses on the legs of the horses and then move beautifully to the faces of horses and behind the snow covered trees interspersed with sunlight .. At the beginning of this scene precisely and smoothly blends beautiful music with songs The sound of women has long been one of the foundations of the genius Inino Moriconi in his works, to become a scene that is not more than a few seconds one of the most beautiful cinematic scenes that I have seen in the cinema, and everyone who saw the film will undoubtedly admire this wonderful scene mixed between the creative cinematography and Saundtrak.
A musician who began to write music for the cinema since the end of the fifties and until now after the passage of nearly 60 years and the same tender with the same creativity deserves all respect.The unknown soldier !?
Have you considered those beautiful scenes in the film? How beautiful it was in terms of camera distance and angles.
All this is left behind by an unknown soldier who has always made many of these beautiful scenes in his constant cooperation with Tarantino, but he does not know much, and this is often due to the habit of many film lovers to focus on the director, actors and sometimes writers.
One of the most intriguing scenes in the film was nominated for nine Oscars and three of them, the cinematographer Robert Richardson.
Scenes of violence !!
Many of the many violent scenes in the film are the only negative point in the film in general. But the truth is that Tarantino is no longer just a shot of death, but a negation of the reality of the killing scene.
Who knows Tarantino well not surprised by the amount of violence repeated in the film because the history of the director has always seen his preference for violence as in the film Pulp Fiction and even inglourious bastards and finally Django.finally
The film is a masterpiece that has emerged in a time when films are no longer as they were before, the collection of successful film elements from many aspects, and make sure that The Hateful Eight will be one of the beautiful films that we are going back to watching as we do now with old movies.
Tarantino, through his works, assures us once again that he does not enjoy receiving an Oscar or other prize, as he enjoys seeing his imagination embodied on the ground through a film."
" Tarantino Strikes Again
",-0.3612,0.9612,2018-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Quentin Tarantino, the man that has yet to make a bad film strikes yet again. The Hateful Eight is arguably up there with some of his best work. The reasoning that this film is up with his best is because he finally used an original score. The problem I have had with some of Tarantino's previous films is the soundtrack that is provided has acted as a, ""Best Hits"" put on shuffle. But no, this time around Tarantino hits on all categories. The performances that he gets out of his actors, especially Samuel L. Jackson reminds us what cinema is all about. Getting lost in the world that is provided. For not one second did I think to myself, ""Man, Kurt Russell is killing it!"". This never appeared in my mind because the costume design, makeup and script gave all these actors a new identity. Because of this, I was lost for the entirety of the 3 hour film. Not to mention, shooting this on 70mm was a nice touch and gave the film some beautiful wide shots. The issues that I have with this film are little but bother me because if you erase them, you could have a potential masterpiece. For one, a song that is not apart of the original score is played towards the beginning of the film and because of how 21st century it felt I was taken out of the setting. Along with that, towards the end of the movie where Samuel L. Jackson gets shot I was a little disturbed. Not by the blood, but by the heavy usage of slow motion. He used the same slow motion in Django Unchained and it bothered me there too. If he changed these details I would have been even happier leaving this film.Besides the little knit-picks, Tarantino shocked me yet again with another brilliant film. I would recommend this film to only few people because of the long run time and ""R"" rating that it is. Sit back and enjoy yourself if you are a movie geek like me."
" Wow...how many people can miss the point?!

This film IS dialogue heavy.But the time is well spent hashing out the characters, and building the tension to a boiling point.The last chapter or two is the powder keg finally exploding. I see reviewers complaining that there aren't any characters to root for and that they are all loathsome and despicable. To this I simply want to direct them to....the TITLE OF THE FUCKING FILM!!! And people point out that cringe worthy scene in the snow w/Sam Jackson and the General's son as pointless., Again missing the point.Up to that point,the character of Marquise Warren WAS the one to rally behind as the sympathetic former Union soldier fighting racism.But after that HATEFUL act in the snow,he loses that sympathy and becomes as,once again,HATEFUL and worthy of condemnation as the rest. The cinematography and musical score rightfully get their due, but the direction and mainly the acting truly shine.It is awesome to see what good actors can do in an ensemble like this.Jennifer Jason Leigh got the Oscar nomination,but IMO ,was no better than the rest.Even the usually one trick (IMO) Kurt Russell tears up the scene.But like most things he is in,Goggins steals the show
This is a fun flick, if you take it for what it is, and don't go in expecting a traditional shoot em' up, all for one Western.These characters truly are HATEFUL!"
" The Hateful Great
",0.2263,0.8666,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"*zero spoilers*The beauty of Tarantino films has always been in their writing. The master class filmmaker has a unique way of turning even the most bland events into thought-provoking moments filled with everyday dialogue viewers can identify with. It is this craft for scripting that Tarantino films take hold, without the need for fancy set pieces, or blockbuster effects. The singular stories and events told within each film are just as entertaining as the ultimate whole they come together to create. It is through this facet that Tarantino succeeds again with his eighth feature film, appropriately titled, The Hateful Eight.The film follows several characters (more than eight, but not all primary) as they ultimately converge together one snowy night in Western Wyoming, each with different motivations. Accusations and bullets soon fly in a who-done-it caper that, while not the biggest twist ending, finalizes itself in a climactic stand-off of Tarantino proportions.This film embodies what we've expected of Tarantino films over the past two decades: interesting characters on relatively simple paths interacting with one another through non-linear story lines in a fantastically imagined alternate reality. As always, expect values to be tested in forms of racism, sexism, vulgarity, and morality, but of course his inclusion of these topics is always meant to draw emotion from the characters and audience. Although some instances within The Hateful Eight are hit or miss depending on your ideas surrounding social constructs, it's all done with good intentions, and not meant to offense. Then again, if you're a viewer that finds themselves often offended at film subjects, for any reason, Tarantino films are clearly not for you. While not as conspiracy inspiring as Pulp Fiction, or Western driven as Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight still stands on its own as another success in the Tarantino library. Those that enjoy their clever conversation with a side of gratuitous violence will find this more than appealing.-W"
" A little long and overwrought, but still a good Western/'whodunit'
",0.5927,0.9748,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Much like 'Spotlight' and 'The Big Short' will be linked, 'The Hateful Eight' and 'The Revenant' will be linked in my mind, due to the fact that they're both set in 19th century wintry American Northwest (this time Wyoming), both nominated for Oscars (although 3 vs 12, with the only overlap being cinematography - probably have to go to 'The Revenant' instead) and both released in January. And while they're similar - and both pretty good - neither is definitely better than the other, and neither is quite as great as it could have been.This is, obviously, Tarantino's 8th film, but it annoyed me that for the majority of the film, there's nine people trapped in the cabin, even though the posters and title refer to the eight of them! O.B. (Parks - 4th Tarantino film), the stagecoach driver, doesn't rate a mention? He has some of the funniest moments in the film! Only Tarantino can have a film starring 'eight' characters and end up with 14 bodies, with some characters still alive at the end! The eight main characters are:
 - Marquis Warren (Jackson - 6th Tarantino film), former Yankee Major, now bounty hunter;
 - John Ruth (Russell - 2nd Tarantino film), a bounty hunter with a great moustache;
 - Daisy Domergue (Jason Leigh - 1st Tarantino film), Ruth's bounty he's taking to hang;
 - Chris Mannix (Goggins - 2nd Tarantino film), the new Sheriff of Red Rock;
 - Oswaldo Mobray (Roth - 3rd Tarantino film), a British hangman;
 - Senor Bob (Bichir - 1st Tarantino film), the Mexican innkeeper;
 - Joe Gage (Madsen - 3rd Tarantino film), a raspy-voiced loner cowboy; and
 - Sandy Smithers (Dern - 2nd Tarantino film), former Confederate General.Feels a little like Tarantino started with a joke: ""a black war hero, a Mexican, an Englishman, a Kiwi and a racist walk into a bar..."" and went from there! Once all eight are trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery due to the blizzard, the mystery of who's who - and where Minnie is - is slowly uncovered, with trust in short supply. Starts very slow - particularly the titles, with Tarantino using his classic colouring and sound to show everyone involved in the film before it can properly start. It's long (2 hours 45min), but not ridiculously so - however, you could probably take out 30min from the start/middle and have a better-paced film. Morricone's score is good, and the cinematography looks great when they're out in the mountains and snow, but over 75% of the film is shot inside the cabin, where it's dark!Takes a while to really get going, but once it does, there's plenty of blood (hence the R-rating), as the truth is uncovered. Jackson is great and the main star, while Russell does a fantastic John Wayne impersonation - his voice cadence and over-bearing attitude are spot on - and Jason Leigh is fun to watch as the vile and racist criminal. The real stand-out, though, is Goggins as the seemingly inept Sheriff - he plays his part with clear relish and gets a few laughs and gets to show some heart underneath his racist exterior. While 'The Hateful Eight' is very enjoyable in parts, I didn't enjoy it anywhere as much as 'Django Unchained' or 'Inglorious Basterds'."
" A dark comedy great
",0.765,0.9771,2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"After rescuing two strange characters from the bitter cold, a bounty hunter and his slave seek shelter from the upcoming blizzard in a remote cabin, where he meets a bunch of other weird people, each with a secret of his own. In order to collect the bounty for his slave, he'll have to take some extra security measures which might help him overcome the dangers to come, while the other characters will be full of surprises for him to uncover.It's a very atmospheric movie, set in a wild and freezing mountain environment, full of unexpected events and complex characters which keeps you eager to discover the next move, never letting you get bored, although it is not as action filled as I was expecting. It manages to maintain a sober atmosphere despite its amusing dark comedy moments, slowly uncovering its mysteries for your pleasure and amazement. I really enjoyed it despite its duration (~3 hours), and although it could have contained a bit more action and not focus so much on lengthy dialogues which tend to feel like fillers, it proved to be a very good watch. Its actors really contribute to this achievement through their wonderful and convincing performance, making this one yet another great from Quentin Tarantino."
" Not Tarantino's best
",-0.5216,0.3588,2017-12-27 00:00:00,4,"Several gunshots go awry in this film, and unfortunately the movie itself misses the mark, also. I never quite cared about the characters. The plot intrigued but never truly captivated. Even the glorious 75mm shots seemed a little superfluous. It was a 2 hour and 45 minute exercise in dialogue and double cross. And listen: I like dialogue. I especially like Tarantino dialogue. But this movie was easily 45 minutes too long. It's a very well made waste of time, but it remains a waste of time."

I am not an anti-Tarantino person; I really like much of his work, but it seems he's been slipping since ""Kill Bill."" His movies are getting stuck in a pattern of juvenile fascination with violence sans any cleverness, which his earlier movies had in abundance. I regret spending the 3 hours plus watching this, hoping something might save it at the very end. In fact, I actually didn't spend 3 hours---the last 13 minutes I fast forwarded. To sum up: this film is a waste of time, and to think of all the money poured into this.... Well, at least it employed a lot of people."

" A Better Kind of Different
",0.4404,0.9729,2017-12-16 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised with this film. I hadn't heard much about it and watched it only knowing Tarantino was the director - which is maybe why I liked it more than the other reviews, I had lower expectations. I also watched it from the comfort of my sofa which is also probably why the film's length didn't bother me as much.Pros: Good (albeit a lot of) dialogue, good cinematography and good acting. I liked the ""who dunnit"" element, the chapters and watching the characters think. I like the character development and backstories. I liked that there didn't need to be too much theatrics or action because the storyline itself was good enough. It wasn't over the top like I find some of QT's films, the characters did all the work. I found it engaging, maybe the production resembles too much of Reservior Dogs, but maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing. Cons: A QT film, so there's a lot of blood, violence and gore, as to now be expected (although still not everyones cup of tea.) Another QT trademark as other reviews have mentioned is the excessive use of the 'n word'. A lot is left massively unaswered and some just plain baffling such as the random narrator."

" Long boring film wastes good actors
",0.1531,0.8078,2017-12-10 00:00:00,1,"Having finally watched the film, I am reminded that Quentin Tarantino lacks the directorial excellence of John Ford and Sam Peckinpah or the writing ability of Agatha Christie, making the film an unsuccessful mishmash of Stagecoach, Straw Dogs and Ten Little N*****s (the book was subsequently entitled 'And then there were none'). At least in 1939, Agatha Christie's readers would not have been as offended by the constant use of the word, as it came from a UK nursery rhyme; with Stagecoach, 1939 cinema audiences were treated to superb acting including an Oscar win and the 70s saw a streak of highly violent films, which were groundbreaking then. This film has none of these attributes â€“ it is long, boring, farcical and wastes good actors and superb scenery in buckets of fake blood and repetitive swearing."
" I liked it
",0.4215,-0.9452,2017-12-08 00:00:00,8,"H8 is a strange movie. It doesn't have anything that I would consider plot twists; it takes place in chapters and has more of a 'and now for the rest of the story' type of attitude. The movie can basically be summed up as a remake of The Thing, but instead of the drama occurring between trustworthy men of average to high character, H8 takes place between men (and a woman) of exceedingly low character. It's also darkly humorous in contrast to the seriousness of J.Carpenter's masterpiece.I think what makes the movie for me is the ending. *SPOILER* The finale shows the two most diametrically opposed characters, mortally wounded, putting aside their hatred, forging a common bond as they mete out a final 'frontier' form of justice before their final breaths are taken. Although it's bleak and bloody, H8 gave me a sense of hope at the end, a feeling that camaraderie, nobility and honor can discovered and upheld by even immoral men in the most immoral times."
" Not classic western
",0.0,0.9939,2017-12-08 00:00:00,10,"Why western again? Does Tarantino have something new to offer us? Oh yeahÂ… Eight mean, mysterious, interesting characters stuck in the same room over similar circumstances. What could we except other then big dose of violence and impudence. Someone who hasn't watched previous Tarantino's movies this might look like some boring drama where couple of random guys meet in tavern and have clueless talks, but this is far more then that.Tarantino plays a poker game here. During the three hours of movie you kinda get impression that this is all a strategy where every thing you do is a crucial move. Minnie's Haberdashery becomes America itself, where is in one moment literally divided on North and South. This is a clear situation after the war spiced with dose of continuous tension. American history is brutally criticized and there is no concept of ""good"" and ""bad"". From the moment when the first company arrives in tavern, we are nailed to the screen carefully following every figure in the game, asking ourselves what hidden messages Tarantino sends us. Acting is phenomenal. They did a great job. The most distinguished is certainly Jennifer Jason Leigh (Daisy Domergue), the most pleasant surprise. Proof of that is nomination for best supporting role. Daisy managed to be very interesting and mysterious, while dominating on every frame and filled it with craziness. The rest of the crew also did a very good job. Even Michael Madsen.Dialogue, the author's best weapon, is of course the main thing in this movie also. Many Tarantino's legendary phrases are still not clarified. What connotative meaning they have and what message they send us is questionable. Tarantino does that on purpose and he absolutely enjoys it. That list just got bigger when John Ruth said ""You only need to hang mean bastards, but mean bastards you need to hang"". All that talks and phrases might not be that provocative and good, if it was not for maestro Ennio Morricone, whose music is maybe the biggest win of this film. Great appreciation to this man. He finally received the Oscar, and that is one more big failure for Academy awards. They waited so many years to give this man some respect. This is another Tarantino's masterpiece. Some may say that we have here already tested recipe. The setting reminds us on Reservoir Dogs, which is in Tarantino's style all the way. He just loves taking this from other movies, even his own.I think most of the people should enjoy this bloody history lessons guided with Morricone's music."
" The way Hollywood geeks want it to be

The difference, however, is that again Tarantino pokes fun at the very dorks who love this sort of propaganda.It's a bit of a comic sneer at the hate filled spaghetti Westerns. Tarantino does sneer at his own fans, it's obvious. And who can blame him? Again, we will hear all the Beavis and Butthead, brain dead, pothead, meth head, loud mouth brats insist this is the real West, but it isn't. These characters wouldn't last long in the real West, but the brats will never want to believe that.It's a story of people who just think their demonic ideology enables them to be supermen, which is what Hollywood turned into after about 1965.Still, with Tarantino, you get a few chuckles, so it isn't as bad as most modern movies.But it's still worthless."
" Tarantino's Best Yet!
",0.6696,0.9956,2017-12-02 00:00:00,10,"For Tarantino fans and movie fans alike, The Hateful Eight is a must-see masterpiece which everyone should watch in its entirety at least once. The Hateful Eight is an intriguing, beautiful, and violent take on the classic ""And Then There Were None"" formula. The film takes place in only two settings (The stagecoach to Red Rock & Minnie's Haberdashery), and makes outstanding use of both. The Wyoming landscape is bleak, open, and beautiful, but is established to be certain death for anyone who steps outside for long. Minnie's on the other hand feels warm and homey, but also has an ominous feel with its dark corners and constant tension. These two polar opposite landscapes make the film feel like a true dealers choice of death and discomfort for its characters. The film starts off with a few calm and funny ""getting to know everyone"" chapters, which although seem boring from an outsider looking in, are incredibly entertaining and fun thanks to the talent of the cast and Tarantino's outstanding cinematography and dialogue. Without spoiling anything, the story then shifts into the previously mentioned ""And Then There Were None"" feel with the entire cast trapped inside Minnie's for at least three days waiting for the storm to blow over. Tensions rise and Samuel L. Jackson delivers a truly Oscar worthy performance as Major Marquis Warren. This is Tarantino at his best and in my opinion the greatest film ever made. The film's charming dialogue, incredible cinematography, perfect casting, and genius story, take it to the top of my list and will hopefully entertain many more for hours to come."
" Tarantino's murder mystery-like western epic.
",-0.6908,0.9513,2017-11-27 00:00:00,7,"""The Hateful Eight"" is Quentin Tarantino's western epic of several strangers together stranded in a cold cabin in the middle of Wyoming. As the tale gradually unfolds, each character reveals their past and anterior motives while the audiences continues guessing who's who.The film understandably takes its time in establishing each character's personality and flavor to the mix. This makes practically every character feel essential to the story while still maintaining the pacing of the engrossing plot of delivering a prisoner to a nearby town to be hung. While the film may feel strangely different than what most are expecting due to its unlikely story structure and unusually long first act. The payoff at the end is well worth the wait. Tarantino's decision to film on location and film on actual film stock created a beautiful, almost classic looking western feel to the movie. The visual landscape is breathtaking and combined with gorgeous cinematography, this may be one of the most beautiful looking films in the year of 2015. With the exception of one or two scenes, the film is paced brilliantly. Making the three hour runtime feel like a breeze. The mood and tension and sense of paranoia feels reminiscent of John Carpenter's ""The Thing."" Unfortunately, the film does get bogged down near the end with a lot of unnecessary graphic violence and gore which adds a shock value that sometimes takes away from certain plot elements. Normally this isn't a problem but it was slightly overdone in this picture. At the end of the day though, this is a highly recommended Tarantino picture and one to genuinely study for quite some time. It's ambitious and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish."

Is it unnecessary violent at times? Oh yes. Nevertheless, it can be enjoyable to watch as the violence is an integral part of the Wild West, and why this movie is only suited for a more mature audience.Tarantino enjoys taking us to the middle of the action, and we feel part of the movie. We follow and understand the main characters, and we feel sometimes touched by their life's story. But life in the Wild West is harsh (and if we don't know this, we will figure it out pretty quickly).It definitely is a movie worth watching and you won't even feel the time passing by."
" Tarantino genius!
",0.0,0.9935,2017-11-24 00:00:00,9,"Tarantino affirms a genius in this film with all his tastes. I found this mystery worthy of a story of Agatha Christie with Tarantinesque treatment. sensational. Technically the film is perfect, the photograph is beautiful, the use of the 70 mm is incredible, and some effects of makeup are simply incredible. The script of the film is very well developed, we have excellent dialogues, very characteristic of the Tarantino, the story is told with great calm, the slower pace helps the public to digest the story and try to solve the mystery. The film is really quite slow, in the first half of the film practically no action occurs, we are presented to the characters, all very well written and acted, the mystery letters are thrown at the table, we still take several discussions on different points of view on the Civil War (1861-1865). Even though the film is very slow in this first half, it is impossible to take the eye off the screen, as we see several discussions and a tension grow between the characters. Here we come to the second half of the film, where there is an abrupt change of tone. We had a slower first part where tension between the characters was developed but in the second part the movie explodes in a whirlwind utraviolent, where the characters enter a brutal confrontation in several scenes that shock even the strongest of the viewer.Even the focus of the film in this part is to show the violence, the mystery is not abandoned and remains the central factor of the plot. But this second part falls in quality compared to the first, especially when the film stops to explain what happened in the cabinet before the protagonists arrive. The scenes are good, but it takes the impact of the end of the film, which, while excellent, does not have the impact it should have. As already mentioned, the cast of the film is incredible, there is not a weak actor in the film, but Walton Goggins and Jennifer Jason Leigh (Oscar nominee for best supporting actress for that role), these two are the highlight of the film. Another thing that is praiseworthy is the Ennio Morricone (which won the Oscar for this film), which gives the whole tone of the film. I recommend that you watch this movie on the largest possible screen, to enjoy the beautiful photograph."

Everything about the Major's persona was 100% made up. He literally did not have a letter from Lincoln (hello, last line of the movie?). The old racist man was traveling to try to honor the memory of his dead son and find closure, so of course the number one way to bait him into pulling his firearm was to make up some horrible, twisted story about his death. C'mon people!This movie had a ton of great one-liners, it really read as a play to me. I had this feeling I was watching some alternate reality version of Clue with the whole ""who done it"" angle, which by the way, the plot twist got me. I thought it was in line with most Tarantino films - ya know, a ton of awful, sometimes evil people who are clever enough to be likable or at least hold your attention for almost THREE HOURS.

Not just a once or twice usage but a prolific use. A usage to the point I became very bothered. Look, I'm not so naive as to think that the N word wasn't used excessively and exclusively at the time period represented in this movie, but it is a movie. The writer, director or some other exec does have a say. I don't think it would be considered historically inaccurate to not use the N word; shoot, there were probably a dozen inaccuracies as it was. Then again Quentin Tarantino seems to have an infatuation with the N word. From his superfluous usage in Pulp Fiction to Django Unchained it is unsettling.

I find it appalling all of the political comments from people that don't understand what makes a good film and giving it a negative review.The locale is in the 1800's for crying out loud. This is a period piece and it is not 2015. Grow some thicker skin or stick to Disney movies... why are you even watching a Tarantino film if you think this world is all pixie dust and fairy tales? It is time to face a dash of reality.On to the review: This film has a magic about it that captures the terrible winter seasons in Wyoming. My girlfriend and I have made this a tradition to watch at the start of winter. Tarantino has a knack for setting up the location and Haberdashery that by the end of the movie you haven't even realized it has been set in one room most of the time. It is just that immersive. You will feel like you are there, spending time by the cozy fire after braving a terrible Wyoming blizzard and enjoying a freshly brewed cup of the Haberdasheries coffee.Regarding the length, It may be long but it is certainly engaging. The reviewers calling this movie ""boring"". Sorry to break this to you, but you have awful taste. The dialogue between the Hateful Eight is a constant romp. Each syllable oozes with entertainment, in part, due to the great performances of the entire cast.The plot is also a gem that somehow manages to keep you on your toes, trying to figure out each character's motives and end game scenarios. The only gripe I have is I wish there was a bit more backstory included with the eight. Although, it does a decent job for most of the characters. By the end, I was hoping to have a bit more light shed on a few of them.As far as Tarantino films go, this one is unique and a welcome addition to the family and on of my favorites."
" Disappointing Christmas movie by Tarantino
",-0.4939,-0.7743,2017-11-18 00:00:00,5,"After a quite promising beginning, the movie seemed to turn into a Christmas movie, which is an original thought seeing as it was directed by Tarantino. But sadly it got more and more boring after that, partly because the pacing was too slow, partly because the story was far-fetched even for Tarantino.Beautifully shot, a plus for the snowy scenes, some interesting dialogue, but apart from that it was a disappointment."
" An Uninteresting Bloodbath
",0.0,0.8355,2017-11-17 00:00:00,3,"(Flash Review)There was a lot of dialog in this which is usually a strong point for Tarantino films but here it dragged, especially with a hefty 3:07 run time. Sure a few interesting quips now and then but nothing close to or as slick and clever as the diner coffee scene in Reservoir Dogs. The story has a little timeline shifting as with his classic films yet not so clever story twists and turns in my opinion. Then throw in some fairly pointless chapter title cards. This of course being a Tarantino film, there is the expected Tarantino over the top bloody moments and cold blooded killing that were nasty gross at times. Part of what took me out of the film was the overly accurate sound effects that didn't feel authentic as well as scenes with rich details that also felt fake and obviously a stage. On to the plot: a stagecoach rumbles through a rural land during a winter in the Civil War era with a bounty hunter and his apprehended female bounty. He is taking her in for an old fashioned hangin'. Yet not everyone wants her dead. Will she get rescued and by whom? Who will end up with the upper hand? How many gallons of blood will Tarantino spill and splatter this time around? Overall, this should and could have been much better. Needed a better and smarter script."
" Horrible Film
",-0.5423,-0.979,2017-11-14 00:00:00,1,"This came out on Netflix so I gave it a try, and was sorely disappointed, if not offended by the time spent on my backside trying to watch it, I tried giving it a viewing twice to see if I was missing the point, nope, every line delivered by Jackson had the N-word in it, or, how he hated white people & loved killing them, then the scene recounting how he'd killed Dern's son and forced him to perform a sex act I found especially disturbing, couldn't watch anymore after that and turned it off for good.This is not entertainment or even a decent film, it's something darker, uglier, and meant to provoke a certain demographic, while only appealing to another certain self loathing, salacious or violent audience. What do you expect from the likes of Harvey Weinstein & Quentin Tarantino who's depravity have reached new heights, and film-making & Hollywood have reached new lows. This is why I don't even bother going to the theater anymore or putting the price of a ticket into their pockets, because it's either garbage for the mindless, or trying to push some social or political issue, the whole point of film is to escape right?Don't waste your time on this movie, it's garbage..."

Tarentino has absolutely bottomed out with this one. Don't worry - no spoiler here, as this film was rotten from square one. Take my word for it - don't waste your time as I did!!!"
" What happened?

There are so many references to his heroes of Hollywood and his own movies that it becomes cringe worthy. The trivia in IMDb misses a lot. And there are a LOT in this movie. There are so many anachronisms and poor attentions to detail that I began to think this was a clever parody.But I don't think it's clever. It's littered with actors from past QT movies, which usually isn't a bad thing, but Tim Roth deserves a Ham Award. Can someone tell me why its snows INSIDE the hut? Why can one see in the distance in a blizzard? Why are there pistes on the mountains? Why use the N word all the time but no one is surprised to see a black person or a Mexican? I get that QT likes The Thing (it's sublime...) but why try to imitate a movie full of suspense and claustrophobia when that it is not your genre? QT leave that to the masters of the 80s. And Joe Gage. Really? (Didn't mention that in your Trivia did you IMDb?) This movie is like a Starbuck's double shot, soya, grande, pumpkin, cinnamon, caramel, machiatto, latte espressacino with extra cream. It's just too much. Don't watch it and go and watch Carpenter's The Thing if you want to see what this movie is supposed to be like."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.4927,2017-11-03 00:00:00,5,"Very disappointing coming from Tarantino .. What could have been a good thriller dissipates into a morality play about racism. Too much emphasis on Samuel Jackson, at the cost of other better actors. Bruce Dern is wasted. And Channing Tatum did this bit role just to be in a Tarantino movie?"
" An attempt to recapture Reservoir dogs that fails
",-0.4215,-0.1271,2017-10-31 00:00:00,5,"The opening of the movie is great. However after the first 30 minutes it begins to go downhill fast. If you have seen Reservoir dogs you have seen this movie. It is just moved to a Western setting and lacking the tension and suspense Reservoir dogs built. There is a great sound track, good acting, but the plot just washes away in a sea of blah. Essentially a B flick rip off with A flick actors and camera work, even if it's Tarantino ripping off his own work. There are some mild political spew, it's a distraction at best and the time wasted could have been used to try to save the plot, build at least a little suspense or do something interesting. Wish Hollywood would understand we don't watch movies to be preached at. We get enough of that already, we watch movies to get away from it. At least the preaching was mild even if it destroyed suspension of belief and produced yawns. The historical mistakes made in the movie were far too many to list. I think you have to lay this dud on the director & writer. Everyone else did a great job with what was a poor script and directing. Maybe Tarantino just needed money or was trying to recapture past glory. He sure missed the mark with this movie. The base concept was a really interesting idea spoiled by poor writing and directing. I am not a big Tarantino fan. Most of his movies are so over the top as to be comical. Every so often he directs a gem. Reservoir dogs was a great movie for example. Pulp Fiction was a pretty good film and Jackie Brown was well worth watching. On the flip side Inglorious Bastards is one of the few high budget WW II films that I didn't like. It was about as pointless and stupid war movie as I've ever seen. Way over the top and so poorly directed you start rooting for the bad guys just so there's something interesting about the movie. Death Proof despite Kurt Russell was another really boring movie. It was one of the few movies staring Russell I did not like."
" Tarantino at his best!
",0.6696,0.9799,2017-10-31 00:00:00,9,"Tarantino's film is strong, mature, complete. Wonderful photography, script full of well-heeled and chained twists. Samuel L. Jackson FANTASTIC (I love this guy). Complex characters, competently portrayed. All are fine in the film, merit the director. In Django Livre the ending is cathartic, its sin is exaggeration. In Inglourious Basterds the ending is surreal, and it smears a film that has a much better start and half than the ending. In The Hateful Eight, as I said, everything is balanced. Start, middle and end fit perfectly. For me, the best film of the year, wronged for not being nominated for such. 9 out of 10."
" Does not bore
",0.1877,-0.3428,2017-10-30 00:00:00,7,"Despite being a whopping three hours long, this film does not really bore me at all. Which was one of the things that scare me the most before I saw it. I really like how the movie was not afraid to show the racist stuff in the time period such as the word N igger (I put that space in there to make it allowed). I also like how all of the characters perform in there characters and the music was actually really good but it was quite loud to listen to on netflix. I also like all of the references that they make to stuff such as Mary Todd and Lincoln as well as the Civil War. And the effects of the film weren't really in your face and doesn't take away from the viewing. The only problem to some people but it wasn't for me is all the racist stuff, but honestly it doesn't really bother me at all."
" Who did it murder mystery anti-western
",-0.6908,0.7003,2017-10-29 00:00:00,9,"Tarantino's last movie belongs to western sub-genre known as anti- western. While classic western has clear, even black and white distinction between good and evil, where we know from the start who's good and who's bad and we are drawn to root for good guys, anti- western brings more realistic picture of Wild West. In old movies white folks are good guys and Indians are cruel primitives, or sheriff against evil gang and similar fairy-tale plots. Pretty unfair and unrealistic. Anti-western is trying to show things in shades of gray, from the ""villains"" point of view, making them just another people who are fighting for their spot under the sun.This genre by itself raised up my expectations. And when you add Tarantino as writer and director, Morricone in charge of music, and in leading roles we have Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, this movie is masterpiece in advance. Board game ""who-did- it murder mystery"" played out as theater play and made into movie. Everything is played out in single room and it's based more on dialogue than action. It starts slow, gradually builds atmosphere and culminate in explosive finale. Almost everything in this movie is Oscar material, from the screenplay, scenography, camera, directing to excellent acting. Jackson is expectedly great in a role that's perfect for him, but Jennifer Jason Leigh definitely stole the movie with her absolutely magical performance. Still, movie misses ""that something"" for me to rate it ten out of ten.9/10"
" Don't waste your time!
",0.3867,-0.7717,2017-10-28 00:00:00,1,"Spending two hours doing any other activity will be better than watching this ""movie"".More sick twisted garbage from America's leading violence pornographer.If you enjoy gratuitous violence, exploding heads and people vomiting on each other then this piece of ca-ca is for you. Making it worse is the characters take all these perversions in stride as if they are everyday occurrences.Tarrantino should do the citizens of Planet Earth a huge favor and permanently retire from film making."
" Another overrated movie from another overrated Hollywood director
",0.0,-0.9432,2017-10-28 00:00:00,5,"Hollywood is filled with overrated directors and actors. They do the same thing over and over again and still gets praised. To mention some, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and here, Tarantino. If you saw at least three of his movies you easily understand that he's the master of dialogues and bloody scenes, and that's it. His works don't have story as you expect. They're just filled with gun shots, bloods and long conversations. Pulp Fiction, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds , and this title follow this rule. Django was somehow different. It had a story, even though it was not good and had lots of holes. I'm wondering whether Tarantino is going to make any different work, for example gun shots in Mars! We know that there will be gunshots, we know who will play in it somehow, we really don't need to know the plot because there isn't, but we know that there is lots of conversations.The Hateful Eight isn't anything else. It's about 170 minutes; too much. Its story isn't novel. It doesn't have brilliance. I don't know if actors really have those accents or they were just pretending, but it was annoying. At some points I felt they're playing in a theater or a studio. There are characters that are not necessary and don't add anything to the plot.I enjoyed Samuel Jackson, cinematography and blood scenes as usual. Some conversations wasn't that annoying. I find it better than Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. I couldn't enlist it in my Worst/Best lists. But it's in my Overrated list. You can watch and enjoy it. But it's not a masterpiece. It will be forgotten easily."
" Red Blood and Grey Gunsmoke Against a Snowy White Curtain
",0.0516,-0.8765,2017-10-10 00:00:00,5,"In the mid-19th century, a blinding snowstorm blows several crooked paths to one central location: a haberdashery in the middle of nowhere. Here, a motley gathering of bounty hunters, fugitives, lawmen and soldiers takes place, but nothing is quite as it seems. Eight may walk in, but far fewer will see the sunlight when this storm clears. Structurally, The Hateful Eight is quite similar to Tarantino's first effort, Reservoir Dogs. A wide variety of brash, violent, colorful characters, bouncing off the walls (not to mention each other) in an enclosed space while an unseen threat keeps them right where they are. Secrets abound, betrayals too, with the audience kept as much in the dark as the participants. Both are reminiscent of a one-set stage show, really, with the added benefit of cinematography. The biggest stumbling block here is setup, specifically how much of it there is before the plot feels ready to proceed. I'm a proponent of establishing things, of not rushing in with guns blazing, but this may be an extreme example. The first act alone runs for longer than many feature films, and while there's some good character stuff in that space, it surely could've achieved the same purpose in half the time or less. The auteur's infamously witty, cutting dialog is absent for this portion of the film, too, which may have contributed to that lethargy. Those who tough it out are rewarded when the pace finally quickens, leading to a typically Tarantino climax - grisly, shocking and wild - but that's awfully familiar territory. For now, this director can still deliver the goods with his back up against the wall, but the time feels nigh for an evolution. He can't answer every riddle with two barrels of lead and a wet, crimson explosion... can he?"

The pity of it all is that here we have assembled some good acting talent, some good possibilities, and, actually, a talented writer and director. It's all lost though. Lost in the meaningless, predictable posing and tripe. Shame!As with Inglorious Basterds, this film totally overdoes itself. (Please also see my review of that film here).We don't, or at least, I don't, want to watch silly macho posing. I don't want to listen to dialogue that, frankly, I could write myself. I don't want to accurately predict the outcome of the film by the end of the first ten minutes. I don't want to sit and have Tarantino waste my time as I watch his silly sense of humour unfold with such monotonous nonsense.... Yawn!Only two things save this film from a rating much lower than the one I've given it here. 1) The original score by Ennio Morricone is excellent. And, 2) The setting in a frozen Wyoming is good - harsh and beautiful.But that's all folks!"
" Surprisingly watchable
",0.296,0.6816,2017-09-05 00:00:00,7,"As someone who's never truly liked a Tarantino movie after 'Pulp FIction,' I was amazed to have actually enjoyed this. While it starts out really slow, and I found myself thinking for the first hour that it was some failed sequel to 'Django Unchained' (which I was not a big fan of), the movie really picks up in the second half as it slowly begins to reveal to us where all these characters came from and why they all ended up in the mess that they're in.Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I always thought was a very talented actress, steals the show here. Her character, Daisy Domergue, is truly the most hateful of the eight. Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson true to form, and the other actors don't slouch either. The dialogue is well- written, and while the pacing sucks in the first half where Tarantino takes too long to set up the story, he's entirely forgiven when he produces a very watchable second half.If there's any serious criticism I can have is that by the time we reach the last twenty minutes, it does feel entirely like the ending of 'Reservoir Dogs'; but considering that this is a Tarantino movie, that's to be expected. I'm just glad he supplied the viewers with enough interesting characters, dialogue, and situations to make this, for me, one of his most watchable movies in over twenty years."
" Quinton Tarantino strikes, once again!
",-0.4199,0.9942,2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"It hasn't been a long time since Tarantino's first try on the western genre: ""Django unchained "", which was by all means the most financially successful picture this director has ever created and it's once more a huge stamp in his neat directorial career, nobody can deny that Quinton Tarantino is one of Hollywood's most creative and immaculate directors, and ""the hateful eight"" does nothing but to approve. It is by far one of the best written, directed and screen played spaghetti westerns of all time and it's another flash of the old Tarantino 's story over action. As obscure and flagrantly dazzling as every one of his movies are , Tarantino confines this masterpiece in a ""reservoir dogs"" like setting , only that it is set in a post- civil war united states .In a time of hatred , racism and blood lust, black bounty hunter and ex- major Marquis Warren, played by the amazing actor Samuel. l. Jackson, finds himself trapped by a blizzard in a shack with a curious group of people among which stands Kurt Russel as John Ruth ""the hangman"", a brute for whom Mr. Russel was naturally fit, tasked to escort a convicted female to a nearby town to be executed, only to be interrupted by a unprecedented blizzard that leaves him to accompany the major and another unexpected guest to their safe haven. In this tensioned atmosphere stands out a man of a familiar personality someone whose character is charmingly witty ,extremely skillful yet apparently dangerous, seemingly unusual to such an excruciatingly calm set. As a matter of fact, anyone who'd watched ""the inglorious bastards"" would think he's kind of a western version of Christopher waltz's unforgettable ""Hans Landa"" ,many people would even say that the persona itself, actually played by the brilliant Tim Roth, is nothing but a lazy copy of the German icon, which is kind of true seeing that Oswaldo Mobrey is nothing more than a polished adapted version of a Nazy officer, is it really that bad to renovate such a memorable personage in a new fresh landscape and with a new actor whose talent is nothing less than his predecessor. In my opinion, it's certainly a hard task that only reveals the brilliancy of the writer that is Mr. Tarantino. As expected from this surprisingly infamous director, this picture has it sufficing share of twist reveals and top-notch action. I can promise you the same way I do for every Tarantino movie (maybe apart from death proof) that this picture is a must see, it's a visionary gem that despite the decor monotony will always keep you on the edge of your seat. It ' s a great picture with a lot of depth and artistic value for it is in itself a mystery that gradually unravels itself in Tarantino-esque manner."

But this surprise doesn't play more roles[2]. Nearly all the characters are secondary. They barely take actions[3]. I find the scenario poor also because the main character who does a detective job does it with clues that didn't occur in front of us. So it's cool, but with no real effect to us because we can only accept them. The movie isn't playing with the spectator here. It goes on and we watch in a distant pace.Finally, like the last Tarantino films it's very bloody and demonstrative with no particular reason, not even a joyful moment like when they shoot Nazis. --- ! spoilers ! --- [1] when the brother appears from the basement [2] he gets shot right away [3] Joe Gage ?Â He tries to shoot with the hidden pistol, but disappears instantly."

But the atmosphere was greatÂ… that cabin out in the snow. The movie has some great epic western score. The scene where Warren and Bob are setting up a rope line to the outside toilet reminded me a lot of a scene from The Thing 1982, even the music sounded a lot like John Carpenter's score for that movie (not a coincidence as Morricone and Russell both worked on that movie). In fact, there is a scene in H.E. where the music is, in fact, an exact copy of Morricone's score for The Thing. Tarantino must be a fan of that movie. H.E. has some of the same feel as The Thing, a bunch of people (mostly men) locked together in the snowÂ… and one or more are not who they appear to be. I thought Bob's Mexican accent was REALLY over the top and wondered why they couldn't get somebody to do a better accentÂ… turns out that the actor is actually Mexican! Warren's gloves are bad a#s. I always loved those big ol' white leather cavalry gloves when I was a kid. There are some fantastic tiny moments between Ruth and DomergueÂ… they are like an old married couple, manacled together, I thought that was really interesting (and even touching)Â… he even cleans a little bit of stew off her cheek. The scene where they serve and eat the stew was probably my favourite. I love a good movie scene where people are sat around eating. I have got to get myself one of those big old wooden bowls and a wooden spoon for my cocido and fabada. That stew looked really tasty. Is the movie based on some real historical events and characters? I got the feeling that Tarantino was trying to create characters around actual events of the time. Lost a lot of respect for Michael Madsen (since his character in Reservoir Dogs) with his new haircut and the extra weight he just looked like a big ol' fat drag queen and not a tough guy. I thought the Tarantino narration halfway through was very forced, just didn't fit into the movie for me. Maybe that was typical in old western T.V. shows? Smithers was cool. If you haven't seen the movie Silent Running I recommend you watch that â€“ It's a Sci Fi classic, with Bruce Dern a the main character. Definitely, a film that I am going to have to watch a few more timesÂ… especially in the winter. It's quite possible that the score may go up on watching it again."

Can he ever deliver a film that is not violent? What this film is aboutWhile racing toward the town of Red Rock in post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his fugitive prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) encounter another bounty hunter (Samuel L.

Greeted there by four strangers, the eight travelers soon learn that they may not make it to their destination after all.A better film could have been made in 1/2 the amount of screen time. The plot points can all stay the same but QT does not see his limits. This film did not do great at the Box Office and QT blames Disney for the poor box office. That is really not true. If the film was better it would have gotten more business. ""The Force Awakens"" did not take away the audience. What kept away the audience was a 3 hour long film that offered nothing exciting.

" Strong but self indulgent
",0.2846,0.8221,2017-07-31 00:00:00,7,"Tarantino has always seemed like a good B-movie director. He learned from them and emulates them. There are better ones, though, who color within the lines. Granted, he has some flair in his dialogue (and scenarios) as a writer, but in the world of linear storytelling, it gets to be cumbersome and self-indulgent. But my view has always been in the vast minority.Somewhere along the line, he was elevated to deity and I don't understand it. And it has created an egomaniac. That is shown from the credits that announce that this is ""The 8th Film by Quentin Tarantino"". O-kay? I fully enjoyed Django Unchained as it seemed more focused on the justified murderous aspirations of its lead. The self-serving acting pauses were in line with the story-line. Same with Jackie Brown, which came from material not written directly by Tarantino.Hateful Eight was not serving the audience, though. The first hour was just two very bloated scenes of men who wanted to get on the stagecoach. And that dumb Lincoln letter. Very forgettable. The next hour was supposedly a thriller on finding out who is the bad guy. Very hyper-extended but done well. The third hour was how the bad guys were going to take over the cabin. We know what was going to happen. It was just a matter of when. Just more colorful characters saying nothing.And the characters were not remarkable, except for Jennifer Jason Leigh. There was not enough in the writing to credit Tarantino for that, either. It was her. But the rest? Just recycled hard-nosed cowboys we've seen before, although done a bit better than the rest. Beating up on Leigh had no real coherence, just illogical Tarantino blood-letting.It could have all been done in 100 minutes. He apparently drew from John Carpenter's The Thing, a vastly superior film. Tarantino should have paid more attention to that.And I didn't see the great publicity about it being shot in Ultra Panavision 70. Who cares? There was not enough to warrant any of that. It was essentially in one room. The exterior stuff was okay, but nothing spectacular."

I really enjoyed this film and appreciated the masterful storytelling.First of all, I feel that Tarantino is an inspired genius whose storytelling tactics and cinematic approaches that defy mainstream filmmakers and movie goers.I am a huge fan of rare, cult, abstract, art house and exploitation films. Tarantino pays homage to these unique and misunderstood genres through his artistic creations.I had already seen Foxy Cleopatra, Enter the Ninja and every Sergio Leone spaghetti western before I even knew who Tarantino was in high school.If you don't recognize these titles, then you will not like Tarantino's films.The Hateful Eight's story seems to be written by a playwright who weaves together mysterious characters, surprising plot twists and conflicting Hitchockian Macguffins.This film is best for people who enjoy the surreal experience of sharp cinematography and a visually powerful story.I highly recommend this film and all of Tarantino's other successful films."
" Western Thriller
",0.1027,-0.9372,2017-07-25 00:00:00,8,"There are far too few Westerns made these days, so Hateful Eight is a welcome addition. The title is typical for a western but that's about it that is typical. Oh, yes, it is set in the 19th century, with all the guns, clothes and horses that you expect in a Western. And so the story begins, with a stagecoach fleeing a terrible snow storm. Aboard the coach is John Ruth, a bounty hunter with his prize, bound for Red Rock. But they don't make it all the way because of the storm. The seek shelter at an isolated cabin, but they are not alone. And so a deadly game begins. All have hidden agendas, and alliances is broken as quick as they are made. From here on it is more of a Mystery and Crime, just set in a Western theme. And it is good. It is told in a slow pace so that there is time to think and make your theories about the next step. Nothing is revealed before it is meant to. The suspense is thick and there is no real good or bad guy. Everyone is a suspect. I really liked it. Not because it is a classic Western, there is no duel, or massive shootout. But because there was a long time since I saw a such a suspenseful movie.Something worth mentioning though. It is a Tarantino movie. There are no massive shooting, but people die. And it is graphic with blood and gore.8/10"

Save your time and assassinate this from your watch list. It deserves a bullet to the projector (or DVD player). Kurt Russell is the best thing going on here (best looking, best character and best actor) and as I recall he is the first to die. Even Tim Roth and Bruce Dern (both who I was looking forward to watching) are not enough to save this film. This is not at all like Django or Inglorious Basterds - both get a 10 from me. This is a bad remake of RezDogs with beautiful horses and dirty, dusty, filthy cowboys."

Others have given the premise to the story so I'll just dive in... even if we buy into the belief that a murderous band of cutthroats, killing everyone in the haberdashery but leaving Bruce Dern alone is beyond far fetched; he'd be dead too if were in real life... but he needed to live so fluke of all flukes, the man who killed his son (Samuel L Jackson) happens to arrive so he could goad Dern into a fight and killing him giving one of the gang time to poison the coffee... contrived much? Then, Oswaldo (Tim Roth) , out of the blue, asks 'which one has a letter from Lincoln?'... how would he know that? That little tidbit was shared while on the stage and Jackson's character was a rider they just happened to pick up on the way. When John Ruth (Russell) realized he was poisoned, instead of pulling his pistol and killing Daisy (Leigh), he starts beating her up... that makes zero sense. Tarantino makes an over the top violent piece of crap that takes three hours to watch... only reason I gave it the time to watch was I was home sick and it filled in the time... I wish I had sat on my back porch and watch the birds instead... this movie is just plain awful!"
" What an epic fail
",-0.5423,-0.9893,2017-07-12 00:00:00,1,"I usually like Tarantino's movies. Not all of them. But still I like them because they are fast and interesting. usually. This movie was almost 3 hours long. 3 hours of my life lost, watching this horrible movie. Let us begin. The movie was advertised to bring a new movie experience. But the whole movie is either in the snow or at Minnie's haberdashery. I don't even know what that means. So, you are not going to watch something with at least decent cinematography. The plot is really simple. Really simple. There is no plot actually. People want to save the woman who is about to be hanged. It doesn;t go according to plan. End of story. The only thing Tarantino promised and he accomplished, was creating truly hateful characters. Can I make a break and say that I NEVER NEVER EVER LIKED SAMUEL JACKSON??? I feel that he destroys every movie he is on. He is hateful in any movie he played actually. And the whole thing with the colonel's son was outrageous. Why did Tarantino make such an upsetting scene? No reason to. Anyway, there are 2 actors I actually like in this movie. Kurt Russel ( who doesn't like Kurt Russel?) and Tim Roth. Kurt Russel played in Deathproof . Tim Roth and Michael Marsden were in Reservoir dogs. We can also see Zoe Bell who is most of Tarantino's films. But this movie was stupid. It has nothing to do with reservoir dogs or any other of his movies. But I honestly believe that Tarantino is indeed clever. I believe he intended to make a movie as horrible as this one. It is slow and unwatchable. Still the ratings are good. Why? Because it is a Tarantino movie. A movie he came close to stop shooting it even if he thought of it years ago. So that makes me thinking that the destroyed his own movie on purpose. For me the experience was wtf did I just watch? For those who haven't seen it yet , you are about to watch a dull, boring movie, about people you don't even care what will happen to them because they are hateful.You just hate them. You don't care. And they will all die, the most stupid way possible."

What to say, I think it's not a movie that you can enjoy more seeing it at the cinema. It's above the average time and has not a lot of action that you can enjoy on a big screen. Action being based on a indoor talking and thoughts can be interpreted as boring, of course, the real action comes when the coffee gets poisoned while Major Marquis Warren is trying to make General Sandy Smithers pick the pistol that he carefully left beside him. Of course this scene didn't finished well. We can say that this scene is one of the few with more impact in the movie. The movie has a good vibe by the time the action takes place. Camera performance is good, sound better and the screenplay is written carefully from the start to the end. At the end of the day, the movie left me asking myself why I did not saw this movie earlier."

The second half is bloody action that's absurd.The movie jumps the shark in Chapter 4, when a narrator narrates what's being shown on the screen.A sure sign of a bad director is he keeps secrets from the audience. Another sure sign of a bad director is he moves around in time. Tarantino does both in this movie.Oh, BTW, Tarantino and Jackson want you to know that all white people are racists."

It gradually lures you in and isn't particularly violent at all, for the most part, but just when you're sitting comfortably enough, the fountains of blood pour into the frame to give this film a true Tarantino feel. Mightily suspenseful, beautifully scripted, exceptionally acted and with an outrageous amount of entertainment, THE HATEFUL EIGHT is a true Tarantino classic. No one quite does it like him."
" Tarantino has completely lost it

I don't even want to know the story behind the drug induced fumes that made Tarantino fall from a cliff since Pulp Fiction. He has produced flop after flop and this I believe, might be the glorious downfall of a producer.This is a movie about torture, because I can't see anyone still being interested in the story halfway through.He caught some big names in the name of actors, but otherwise, I can't see anything saving this film from being a total failure. I just waited and waited for anything of interest to happen and it never did.I can write you a story of a family being trapped in a snowy mountain, discussing irrelevance. Nothing of that would ever produce interest in Hollywood. Apparently, if you're Tarantino, anything of mumbling incoherence will produce gold.Tarantino is the reverse of Midas at this point, with consequential results."
" No, There Wont Be Many Coming Home!
",-0.3595,0.9981,2017-06-06 00:00:00,10,"I cant rate or praise this movie high enough. The film is a complete masterpiece that once again proves Tarantino as the best director of the 21st Century. Heck, that's a bold statement!SPOILERS AHEAD!The film is beautifully shot by Robert Richardson. His cinematography is beautiful and amazing. The acting is wonderful, each actor, and i i mean every actor chews the scenery. I absolutely love this film. The film stars Kurt Russell (Big Trouble in Little China) as John Ruth, a bounty hunter nicknamed ""THE HANGMAN"". Samuel L.Jackson (Pulp Fiction) plays the ex-slave turned bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren. Walton Goggins (Fandango Unchained) as Chris Manixx, a superbly racist supposed sheriff. Then we have the films wench, Jennifer Jason Leigh (Amityville:The awakening) is daisy domergue, a murderer John Ruth is taking in to hang. After our main cast we the films other denizens. Micheal Madsen (Reservoir Dogs) plays Joe Gage, a mysterious ranch hand who is going home to see his mamma for Christmas, supposedly. Reverent actor Bruce Dern (Hang 'em' High) plays the amazingly racist ex-confederate general Sanford ""Don't Give a Damn"" Smithers, who has quite a rabid hatred with Marquis. Next we have DemiÃ¡n Bichir (Machete Kills) plays Bob The Mexican, a mild mannered supposed employee of the Local Haberdashery. Then there is Tim Roth (Pulp Fiction) as Oswaldo Mobray, a meek, sharply dressed British man who claims to be the local hangmen of the local town, Red Rock. And yes, quite a surprise, Channing Tatum (21 Jump Street) as Jody Domergue, the brother of Daisy. The actors in the film are wonderful. Kurt Russel and Samuel L. Jackson both kick ass in every scene they're in. Bruce Dern is great, i love seeing an actor of such a higher caliber sill acting. Walton Goggins performance is amazing, he is so believable and hilarious as Manixx.The film is shot beautifully, the shots are so well composed and pretty. Thats one i love about all Quentin Tarantino films of the modern age. They are all so well beautifully crafted from a imagery and especially a story point. The film is full of twists and turns. The film is also very gory. it surely not as gory as the now classic spaghetti western Django Unchained. The film has a visceral nature that i love. The violence, the acting, the photo-play, everything is great in the film. The film is beautiful, especially from a film making stand point is amazing. I cant wait to see Tarantino's next film witch i'm sure will be a masterpiece. The Hateful Eight is an amazing film, a true masterpiece. Two-Pistols fully raised up!"
" Genuine Saint Quentin tale
",0.0,0.1505,2017-06-05 00:00:00,10,"This film, like most of Quentin's is a collage of scenes and subplots from other films of his own and others. The ""severed ear"" of Reservoir Dogs is one. I missed the Michael Madsen ""choreography"" and slicing scene. Michael was not his usual intense self.The ""circle shoot"" also was common to both this film and Reservoir Dogs. The complicated plot and surprise ending was very Pulp Fiction.The over the top spatter of bloody projectile vomiting and the covering of characters with blood and brains was typical.All told, a splendid example of Saint Quenten performing one of his film miracles. He manages to put more intense stock scenes into a movie than any other director without it becoming a farce.This is a ""Must see"" for Tarantino fans. I just wish he hadn't tried so hard to be politically correct (LOL)."
" Ignore the Hate! This Film is one of Tarantino's Best...
",-0.7574,-0.5102,2017-06-03 00:00:00,9,"The Hateful Eight is the eighth entry of film through the ultimate writer and director, Quentin Tarantino. He has stated that he will only be making 2 more films, which in a total becomes 10 films throughout his wondrous career. It is so sad and relieving to believe only 2 more films will be inclined from the fantastic writer and director Quentin Tarantino. Because this film is a welcome addition to fans of himself and to the beloved audiences that makes it one of the finest western films of the decade. The Hateful Eight starts with John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) comfortably travelling inside a wagon led by horses heading their way to the path of Red Rock, a small village which John Ruth is a bounty hunter and he's requirement is to capture Daisy Domergue and hang her in the town to get paid. On their path stands Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson) who is another bounty hunter but is black. His request for the long ride with them is because of an awful, deleterious snow blizzard. On their way meets another character, Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff of the town 'Red Rock'. Arriving their way, from the heavy blizzard that stands to disturb their way they decide to seek refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery. Already, there are in total of 4 people waiting inside the Haberdashery as they claim that Minnie has been gone for a week to visit her mother for Christmas. While committing to stay for a few nights, a disastrous murder happens between the night by a coffee and between the hateful eight's, they seek to discover the incident and who the criminal is amongst them. This might be similar to an older film and a popularized board game both named 'Clue'. Aside from the minor detailed plots, it doubtlessly borrows similar elements of its original concept. One might say, it is a direct plagiarism, but for the defense, I'd like to put as inspirational. The impression might be familiar but it is the story and the characters that make it very different from the inspired source material and other mainstream thriller films. A clear example may be, the collision between Major Marquis and the residence who were already resting in the haberdashery, the hilarious chemistry between John Ruth and Daisy. Another might be, a sequence in which Major Marquis explains the death of General Sandy Smithers' (Bruce Dern) son which remained a mysterious clue but now revealed from the dirty, deceitful mouth of Major Marquis. This 10-minute sequence is an aspect that decorated the film over up, and still remains to be memorable and highly impressive that made my first knuckle tight, and the sense of dread that made it authentically disturbing to view. The cast of The Hateful Eight is undeniably fabulous. These actors and actresses deduce like they are fully committed to their roles in the film. To begin, interesting characters have been shown off to the screen as the film slowly reveals each of the characters which are utterly different in most other western or typical mainstream movies. As undoubtedly these characters are enjoyable, the acting of performance that is given by each make it more stimulating and enchanting. A prime example I would use would be, Samuel L Jackson as Major Marquis Warren. He is strikingly amusing and courageous as a dangerous and clever bounty hunter. He has a sense, in which is dread whenever he beings making movements and when he starts opening his mouth to speak. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I believe that it is his best performance since the 1994's Pulp Fiction. Like all Tarantino films, all of his films are unduly bloody violent. He is a director who doesn't care about the age conscious and continues fully with the bloody violence that everyone could possibly imagine. Mainstream films, tend to hide violent acts of scenes and blood for disturbance but it may make the viewing bored and clichÃ©d. However, Tarantino just shows the violent scene of violence that may be disturbing but totally fun and interesting. The film doesn't go for Tarantino violence for the first and second act. When the third act hits, it changes the plate and switches into an R-rated Clue version which was a total blast. The film's running time is 167 mins which are close to 3 hours maximum. This is undeniably a huge number for a film to the tide, but from the immensely interesting characters, the absurdity bloody violence and the marvelous dialogue which Tarantino's professional writing shines the most makes the 3 hours run time fill like 30 minutes. A flaw that could be mentioned is, because of the long run time, sometimes the main story drags into nothing and appears at the main points usually at the third or final act of the film which most Tarantino films tend to have an issue.Ennio Morricone's score feels like the perfect music composing for a stage play that shifts the tones correctly according to the sense of dread of the scenes. The cinematography and the Ultra Panavision 70 mm camera is stunningly gorgeous, as it takes wide shots, that makes it a perfect vision for a stage play as well.As a conclusion, Tarantino has made yet another sequestered masterpiece from himself. Like all Tarantino films, The Hateful Eight is funny, scary, alluring, dreadful and every time a new case or an unexpected condition occurs that makes the audience thought to provoke and entertained of what it accomplished.

More succinctly I find great similarities between Fargo Season 2 and Quentin Tarantino's Hateful 8. I would point to plagiarism on someone's part however the close proximity to which both were released make it more like a wild coincidence. Then again Partridge Brady. Munsters Adams. These things do happen fast. Rather than put you through the drudgery of reading my lengthy treatise, I will put down my thoughts in note form. Bokeem Woodbine's character is very much like Samuel L. Jackson's character in his preference for the full hairdo and the quoting of brainy ideas..usually right before an execution. I know Hateful 8 and Fargo season 2, so allow me to get back on track. Both Fargo Season 2 and Hateful 8 have colorful villains who are both comic book like and terrifying. Both shows culminate in a bloodbath. Both have murders that take place, but then the scene cuts to the beginning where an unassuming, non-threatening voiced narrator attempts to give clarity or the mystery. The colored, ur... ah, African American gentleman in both features is an anti-hero who has definitive quirks that have allowed him to succeed despite being outnumbered and trifled with at every other turn for being a Colored, Ur..a... I mean...African American gentleman. Both feature a Sheriff who is an old school throw back to by the book law enforcement and modeling of proper behavior which makes their character beyond reproach. Lest not forget, the haunting yet mischievous sneakily running forward beat Soundtrack that netted Hateful an Oscar is heard in short order variation throughout the most pivotal scenes of Fargo Season 2."

Not to mention the 70 mm Panavision experience (in selected theaters).With all this going for it, ""The Hateful Eight"" had all the elements to become one of those movies that excels in so many areas. On paper, by design, this movie had it all. Unfortunately, everything the movie had going for it was squandered by the gratuitous violence embedded across multiple scenes. Many of the scenes in the movie could have benefited from a ""less is more"" approach which would have enhanced the suspense and made this the classic thriller-western it deserved to be."
" Cabin Fever
",0.0,-0.8603,2017-05-09 00:00:00,8,"Blizzard weather conditions lead to eight strangers sharing the warmth of an outskirts cabin, including a bounty hunter suspicious that someone is planning to free his prisoner in this mystery thriller from Quentin Tarantino. It is highly atmospheric stuff thanks a mix of moody music from Ennio Morricone and mobile cinematography from Robert Richardson with shots that slow creep up and down the characters. The film is divided into six chapters. The first three vary in excitement as they merely set up the tension and animosity in the air; the final three chapters though are powerhouse stuff with unexpected bursts of graphic violence, an intriguing murder mystery and the shadiness of everyone's background story (are any of them telling the whole truth?). This is, however, also one of those movies where it is nearly impossible to find a single character to care about or like, due in part to how little insight we get into anyone's actual background. And yet, this is perhaps the very purpose of 'The Hateful Eight': to create an emotional distance between the viewer and the flawed characters in order that we are forced to witness the power of hate, greed and revenge tear the characters apart without necessarily rooting for anyone to succeed. However one cuts it, this is a surefire interesting experience as long as one stays patient during the slower-moving first three chapters."

Why do people rave about Quentin's movies, when a good western remake like True Grit is lightyears better, and enjoyable to watch?Quentin CANNOT make Westerns. This is evidenced first by his disastrous train wreck of Django. Now we have another western, again, teeming with black people and other bizarre out of place characters (a strange British fop) and out of place music.This is a CLUE board game movie set in a cowboy snowbound cabin setting.NOTHING about this movie makes any sense. The cabin itself is full of holes! The people inside have plenty of nails and lumber, as is evidenced by their insanely stupid 'door lock system' of hammering boards over the door every time someone comes in, yet they put zero effort into chocking up the many cracks and holes in the place.The huge cast of black people, in a Wyoming set Western, makes absolutely no sense whatso-ever. Can someone tell me when it was finally legal for a black person to travel by stage coach? I'm guessing the 1930's? And only then with all-black stagecoaches and drivers?So OK, this is a classic CLUE who-dunnit movie, set in a Western, with lots of quirky characters like Colonel Neo-nazi Mustard, Professor Hangman Plum, etc.. And as that, it is very poorly done. We have very few clues to work with, no meat at all except wild speculation leading to executions in some parts. We have glaring stupidity in others, like a shady Mexican who would call himself 'Bob' to avoid suspicion?The central focus of the violence and mayhem in this movie is an EXTREMELY UNCONVINCING Jen J. Leigh as a high level gang leader who is facing the noose if her bounty hunter owner can get her to the city. She does NOT carry this role at all, and comes across as a WITCH, especially when she is literally covered in blood-vomit and has her teeth smashed in to resemble a vampire, a get-up she wears for half the movie. She cackles a lot too. So clearly, Jen was channeling CARRIE. The movie also takes a completely unnecessary side duck into softcore domination porn, something Quentin relishes in, witness the end of Pulp Fiction, that should have earned this movie an NC-17 rating, but if it's QT, they write it up to 'art' and move on. It's not art, it's disgusting soft core domination porn, and completely unnecessary for the script and the movie.The movie ends with some gratuitous death-porn as we watch the witch slowly get hoised up to the rafters with a noose, slowly choking to death as the 'heroes' laugh and joke about her.In between we are treated to endless hours of plodding dialogue, punctuated by the odd gunshot. After Django I swore I'd never watch another Tarantino Western again, and thank god I saw this on TV."
" Extremely Underrated
",0.0,0.9849,2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie on Xfinity for free. I was debating on whether I should watch it or not, because many people said it was not that good, and rather long. I decided to give it a shot, and if it did not capture my attention then I'd turn it off (as I did not pay any money). Within the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. This has that classic Tarantino feel, but is milder than most of his recent films. As I was watching this, I thought it felt like a mix between a western, a game of Clue, Reservoir Dogs, and The Thing. Afterwards, I found these were the inspirations for this movie, which wasn't surprising. Grant it, this idea is not completely original, but puts a great spin on the classic ""The Butler Did It"" story. I really don't understand the disapproval this movie received. I put it ahead of Django, and would maybe go as far as saying this is my favorite Tarantino film (behind maybe Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs). I think people have come to expect Tarantino movies as gore fests, like with Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds, and Django. This certainly has some great violence, but it is more of a character development story, and a guessing game. I could see why people would say its boring. But if you enjoy great dialogue and tension, this is possibly Tarantino's best. The acting was phenomenal from everyone. There's a reason Tarantino uses the same actors in many of his movies, and that reason is evident here. Tarantino clearly has a feel for his actors, and they have a feel for him. it works flawlessly every single time. The movie is three hours long, and quite frankly it did not seem that long. I was upset when it ended. Overall, you need to give this movie a chance. Go into it, knowing it's not a constant gore fest, and I think you will appreciate it much more."

However, where, for example, ""Pulp Fiction"" excelled, ""The Hateful Eight"" falls into repetition, gloats too much on its weaknesses and it feels as a piece of narcissistic artistry. It is a movie that loves itself way too much.Growling John Ruth is bringing bad woman Daisy Domergue to justice. On their way to Red Rock, under a blizzard, their stagecoach starts picking up random people. And seeing that the blizzard is not stopping, they take refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery, where they meet a whole lot of unfamiliar faces, the owner and regular costumers of the place nowhere to be seen.Cue more than two hours and a half of suspicion, bullets flying, way too long dialogues and many many scenes that could have been cut out. Tarantino is enjoying his writing skills too much and forgets that he is telling a story through the medium of cinema. Many parts of the story feel irrelevant, and, on top of that, there are more than one or two incongruities, the characters taking decisions that make little sense.The strengths of the movie, though, almost carry the story. The acting, the direction and some scenes are really good, almost outstanding. But it all ends up an exercise of self-service."

Unfortunately, ""Q"" gets an F for overly brutalizing racial diatribe, senseless vulgarity and vernacular more consistent with Jackie Brown than an 1870 mystery. There were stupid set mistakes and nonsensical passages with bodies in the well, which was their only source of water. It was a snowy open area where bodies could have been left anywhere out of sight. The cabin was a slaughter house but no one smelled blood when they first walked in; come on. The front door was being nailed shut when there were four chairs and a table that could have been propped up against the door. It all adds up to a lazy writer producing a bad script.The overuse of blood becomes humorous and the film becomes anticlimactic at the end. Agatha always ties thing up in a bow during the payoff - not this movie!"
" Bloody, good
",0.0,0.8139,2017-04-18 00:00:00,9,"Tarantino's latest grisly opus, The Hateful Eight, is a tightly written and beautifully realized Western with an excellent ensemble cast. Typical of Tarantino, the film is extremely violent, crude and coarse, but at the same time so over-the-top that most (but not all by any means) people will be enjoying themselves too much to be offended. Overall: although not to everyone's taste, The Hateful Eight an outstanding movie from a great director. Watch for Jennifer Jason Leigh to almost break the fourth wall during the guitar scene â€“ the reason, sort of sad, sort of hilarious, is in the 'trivia' section."

" I'm not crazy, right? I actually liked this movie! What's up with the H8?
",-0.3069,-0.9541,2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"The Hateful Eight is a well-done mystery western film, that I think would actually work as a stage play. It's basically a Reservoir Dogs-esque film set in the Wild West; but it's set entirely in the winter, and an isolated cabin. Mr Tarantino wrote and directed this unique and troubled production (which was almost cancelled due to the script getting leaked on the internet) that was eventually made into one of 2015's most standout offerings of the cinema.The Hateful Eight is meant to make the audience uncomfortable about all the deceit plaguing the characters in the story. They're eight people stuck with each other, and none of them particularly like or trust each other. Yet at the cabin they're all stuck in, there's a terrible secret everyone of them are totally unaware of.Take this film for what it is. I enjoyed it. I know some people like it, and that a few others also didn't like the film. That's okay. It's a western confronting the archetypes of old, and gives them some confronting twists here and there.The Hateful Eight gets a solid 9/10."
" A violent western from Tarantino
",-0.5994,-0.9929,2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Set in the middle of the winter in Wyoming, this western opens with Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter, stopping a stage coach to ask for a ride to Red Rock. Aboard the coach are fellow bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth and his prisoner Daisy Domergue. Sometime later they pick up another passenger, Chris Mannix, a former Confederate soldier who claims that he is the new sheriff of Red Rock. Unable to get to town before a blizzard strikes they stop at Minnie's Haberdashery. Here they immediately think something is wrong; there is no sign of Minnie and the story told about her absence seems unlikely. Already there are Bob, a Mexican who claims to be running the establishment in Minnie's absence; Oswaldo Mobray, who claims to be the hangman heading to Red Rock; Joe Gage, who claims to be a cowboy going home to visit his mother and General Sandy Smithers, formerly of the Confederate Army.Here tensions rise as Ruth is convinced that one of those men is there to free his prisoner. There is also tension between Warren, a black, former Union officer, and the two former confederates. It is only a matter of time before these tensions explode into bloody violence. Before the film is over many of those present will end up dead and we will learn what happened before the stage coach arrived at Millie's.At two hours and forty minutes in length this film is certainly rather long but I never felt bored. The opening scenes did a fine job of introducing the various characters and telling us a little about them that makes the viewer wonder if what we are told is trueÂ… in some cases it is and in some cases it isn'tÂ… and not always in the cases we expect. The setting is great; a single room where everybody is trapped for the duration of the blizzard provides a sense of claustrophobia that increases the tension even more. It is very much a film of two halves; the first is tense but gently pacedÂ… people talk but there is little violence. The second half is far more violent; this violence is very bloody and at times very shocking. The cast does a fine job; most notably Samuel L. Jackson as Major Warren, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue and Kurt Russell as John Ruth. As one would expect from a film from Quentin Tarantino this won't be for everybody and certainly isn't for younger viewers with its extreme violence and frequent use of the racist 'N-word'Â… not that the film is racist, just some characters. Overall I'd recommend this for fans of Tarantino's other films."

Here is exactly what you get. A claustrophobic gabfest, essentially in one cabin, ultra gratuitous exploding blood squibs, ridiculous over use of the N. word and the F. word, a story that makes absolutely no sense, and perhaps worst of all, 168 minutes of your life gone, with nothing to show for it. The film is neither entertaining nor enlightening. It is however an endless parade of nonsense, that Tarantino mistakenly believed had meaning. Do yourself a favor and tell your friends to avoid this like you would a rabid dog. You see, a 90 minute bad movie only wastes 1.5 hours of your time, while this disaster wastes almost twice that, and for that reason alone this is the worst movie I've ever seen. - MERK"
" All the signature marks of a Tarantino film, well crafted.
",0.2732,0.9363,2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Some of us, I guess, consider Tarantino films a guilty pleasure, although there must be quite a few of us judging by the box office receipts that his films collect, to say nothing of the accolades, and the ""A list"" of actors who people them. Always, by more conservative viewers, considered slightly ""over the edge"" in terms of violence, sexual innuendo, and bad language, (as in his prolific use of the ""N"" word), his films are nevertheless very entertaining, and this one is no exception. Its primary appeal is in the casting of a group of very good actors who carry off their roles with exceptional skill. The plot and the dialogue are likewise imaginative, and come, again, from the apparently fertile brain of its director, who also wrote the script. Sam Jackson, as always, is a stand out, as is Jennifer Jason Leigh in her Academy Award nominated role as the quirky outlaw Daisy. But I have to say that Walter Goggins kinda steals the movie. He and Jackson, who shared the screen in Django Unchained, are a potent combination, and Goggins has grown into an actor of wide range, and considerable appeal. I confess that early on I dismissed Tarantino too lightly, but have come to consider his films highly accomplished entertainments. If you like westerns, with inventive plots, this one is not to be missed."
" Eight is Enough
",0.0,0.9775,2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Quentin Tarantino should really remake The Thing. In fact, he easily could remake it with the cast and setting of this very film. Heck, he already has an incredible Oscar-winning Ennio Morricone who unironically utilizes unpublished excerpts from his The Thing soundtrack. He has The Thing star, Kurt Russell. He has an isolated cabin in a blizzard. Had the cabin has some dogs outside that started barking when Samuel L Jackson came near this would have been a better movie for it. (And it would have let Morricone reuse some his soundtrack from that Kristy McNichol vehicle White Dog that he penned the same year as his Thing soundtrack.)That the idea above is an overly film geeky and a silly genre switcheroo is what one used to hope for from a Tarantino film. This film, however, plays out much more straight and really doesn't hold it's most interesting gambits that it does keep. Kurt Russell has a prisoner played by Jennifer Jason Leigh that he is stubbornly bringing in alive. He is convinced (correctly) that one or more people trapped in this cabin with him are working against him to free his charge. The movie threatens to break into a surprisingly engaging Agatha Christie-style mystery. Unfortunately, Tarantino switches gears about the time it starts to get interesting. This being a Tarantino movie we are awash in an excess of blood and cruelty and racial epithets. Alas, the film simply doesn't earn them as well as say Reservoir Dogs did. There are some great set pieces that I will not spoil but they are surrounded by a lot of slow. Tarantino might argue (correctly) that he with his score, 70mm filming, and pacing is aping the style of the old three-hours western such as Once upon a Time in the West, or the Dollars trilogy. But seriously have you sat through one of those in one films in one sitting in the last twenty years? It can be a slog. This film can be a slog.All the actors (sans Madsen) do a great job. The soundtrack is wonderful. Parts of the movie such as the Agatha Christie bits mentioned above really work well. Alas, there are some things that simply do not work. There is an overlong flashback that basically takes all the mystery out of the last act. Tarantino's narration is jarring, poorly done and unnecessary. The first hour of the movie takes that hour to tell twenty minutes of setup. Overall worth a watch for Tarantino fans and for Jennifer Jason Leigh's fantastic performance. But like those three-hour westerns of old, I don't see myself watching it again."

" Almost more of a film of 'two halves' than Kill Bill
",-0.6908,-0.8293,2017-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Film-lore goes that Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' was running so long that the studio took it upon itself to split it in two, hence giving us parts 1 and 2. That was probably true, but I get the feeling that the same could have been applied to Tarantino's latest offering The Hateful Eight.' However, perhaps one reason this never happened was because no one ever bother watching the first half! As much as I do love Tarantino's work, I do sometimes think that portions of his various epics can be a little 'overblown' and wordy for the sake of it. I know that good dialogue establishes character motivation and development. But then if it's done too much then I start fiddling with my phone until it's over. I felt that this was the case for the first half. We're treated to one long dialogue-heavy scene after the next. Yes, they're well-acted and everything, but I have to confess that my attention started to wander. We're introduced to the eight (all-star!) cast members who are all assorted Wild West types destined to get trapped together in an out-of-the-way wooden house by a blizzard. And, once they're stuck with each other's company, they don't just rely on their sharp tongues to spar with each other â€“ they have guns, too.Samuel L Jackson's (arguably) breakout role came in Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' and, although he's never had a quiet day since, he has occasionally struggled to be quite as formidable his former hit-man. Not here. The coolest dude in Hollywood is back with a vengeance. Despite great performances from Tarantino 'stalwarts' Michael Madson, Kurt Russel, Janet Jason Leigh, the wonderful Tim Roth (and even Channing Tatum!), it's Jackson who steals every scene. Although Walton Goggins does deserve a mention â€“ I just can't remember him in anything else.I did enjoy The Hateful Eight, just more the second half. It's where everything comes together. I won't go into the hows and whys of everything and who's going to double-cross who as that will run into 'spoiler territory' but when the bullets do start flying it is a welcome relief from the constant dialogue.Overall, I'd describe The Hateful Eight as a longer version of Reservoir Dogs set in the Wild West. It's basically a violent, claustrophobic little number with much dialogue and plenty of characters stabbing each other (or rather shooting to be precise) in the back for reasons that only eventually become apparent. Just don't zone out too much in the first half â€“ the second act more than makes up for the talking (although Reservoir Dogs did have a better soundtrack in my opinion!). Just get ready for yet more bad language and blood splattering across your screen!"

I can't believe that either Jackson or Russell chose to be associated with and descend into this. It had potential but T. and the crew chose to use this specifically to mislead. It's sort of a turd wrapped in Filet Mignon. The steak is good enough to make you keep eating but by the time you're halfway done with your meal you realize the steak sauce is just liquid feces."
" Full of Hate and Doesn't Rate Positive reviews
",-0.7666,-0.9965,2017-03-01 00:00:00,2,"Quentin Tarantino wasted 70mm cinematography on this movie filled with hate by a self loathing director who continues stoking racial strife by rehashing distorted history from the tragic period of 150 years ago. The Civil War cost the lives of 500,000 young men but all Tarantino does in this movie is spew hate.There are no insights into racial issues done with any intelligence. Just lots of pretentious dialogue and several references to a fictitious letter by Abraham Lincoln that is read at the end of the movie after criminal Daisy is hung inside Minnie's Haberdashery.Being technically competent does not make up for the nastiness in this movie. The worst sequence being the recounting/flashback by Samuel Jackson's character Major Marquis Warren of his murder and humiliation of the son of Confederate General Smithers. Smithers is played by Bruce Dern, who must really be desperate for any role to be in this angry film.In that sequence Samuel Jackson tortures and forces the son to perform oral sex upon him, while the son is naked in the wilderness setting before his death. Jackson, who seems to enjoy his torture tale, right out of a maximum security prison for rapists and other perverts, should be ashamed for taking this explicit role and it doesn't jive with his hawking Capital One Credit Card.Anyway, the movie is pointless and I really wish Tarantino would take his movie mimicry into another endeavor--- like becoming a permanent movie critic because he does no service to the art form with the likes of this movie and the ""Django Unchained"" shock style of ""movie making."""

""The Thing"", which Tarantino saw as the main influence for this movie, was capable of creating a similar atmosphere in 109 minutes. Was the Hateful Eight so special that it deserved a whole extra hour?I like Tarantino's style, and Kill Bill is one of my all-time favourite. The Hateful Hate felt like an exaggeration of that style, the worse being the random dialogues that never end (and at times, seemed to come from Tarantino instead of coming from the characters) and the beautiful and very long tracking shots."

There was a great cast of actors however the violence towards the female character was excessive and unnecessary. I realize she was a murderer and was to be hung, but the violence perpetrated towards and against her was over the top. Since when has it ever been okay for a man to PUNCH a woman in the face????? She antagonized the characters in her role in the movie....that should not be an excuse for her character to be brutalized. Violence against woman in the movies has become the norm, so it is accepted and even welcomed in most entertainment today. Pretty sad. Had I known it was a Quentin Tarantino movie, I would have immediately stopped watching knowing what the movie would contain. Tarantino is depraved. He seems to love movies with a lot of excessive and unnecessary violence. What a disappointment. Glad I didn't pay to see this!"
" Deathly bore in the snow
",-0.25,-0.9873,2017-02-10 00:00:00,1,"After Django Unchained and now, The Hateful Eight, I'm convinced Quentin Tarantino only makes Westerns so he can use the N-word with impunity and suggest it's ""historical accuracy,"" rather than blind racism. Tarantino is now the Leni Riefenstahl of the KKK. H8 is a rancid stew of racism, misogyny, sexual violence, bad Southern accents and worse acting. Once upon a time, QT's strengths were his direction of actors and his dialogue. Both seem to have died snowblind in this Wyoming blizzard. Whether it's Kurt Russell's blustery ripoff of Jeff Bridge's Rooster Cogburn or Tim Roth's twittery Brit (what were you thinking, Tim?) the acting is universally dreadful. Jennifer Jason Leigh's Southern accent is the worst I've heard since Kevin Costner tried for N'Orleans and flopped. And even Walton Goggin's, who rose to fame as Appalachian white trash in Justified, inflates his accent to the over-ripe. The dialogue is mostly Russell bully-blustering the other actors or endless drippings of Southern fried N-droppings. (In one exchange between Bruce Dern and Goggins, it's tossed back and forth something like 7 times.) Tarantino somehow managed to fail the simple task of creating believable character names. They're either ludicrously unpronounceable (Daisy Domergue; Marquis Warren) or ostentatiously silly (Oswaldo Mobray). And QT has managed to take modern special effects (key to an action movie) to new lows of ineptitude. In the various shootings, the blood seems to wash in waves from the victims, from balloons over-inflated with dollar store red paint, then exploded with firecrackers. For most of his career, Tarantino seemed an unusually gifted, if emotionally arrested artist too easily drawn to the juvenile. Now the juvenile emotions seem to have taken complete hold and left him with an empty bag and no way forward. From the evidence of his last two or three movies, ""no way forward"" may be a good thing."

" There won't be many coming home
",0.0,0.9873,2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Now, yours truly is and probably forever will remain a devoted Quentin Tarantino fan-boy. I'm a huge admirer of everything this man has done so far and I also honestly think that he's one of the very few filmmakers out there who has developed his very own, unique and inimitable style. Even if it wouldn't be hyped and anticipated months from beforehand all over the internet, you'd still be able to recognize QT's newest movie straight away. Why? Because there simply isn't another director who writes dialogues like he does. There isn't a single other director who provides a soundtrack so suitable for his/her films. There aren't any other directors that find the exact right balance between visual style, atmosphere, dialogues, humor and excessive violence. There are very few directors that somehow bring out the best possible performances from their entire ensemble casts, etc.Still, it sometimes seems as if Tarantino's formerly worshiped trademarks are now turning against himÂ…. I have the impression that I read more and more hate-reviews every time he releases a new film, and all things that people used to love unanimously â€“ like the dialogues â€“ now seem to upset and irritate them. It's not because I'm a big QT fan that I'm not skeptical and, yes, admittedly even I would have preferred that ""The Hateful Eight"" was less talkative and at least 30-45 minutes shorter in running time. The film is great in terms of atmosphere, setting, character development and camera-work, but nearly two and a half hour of (primarily irrelevant) drivel and balderdash before anything exciting happens is a little bit too exaggerated; even for a master like Tarantino. And another point of criticism, personally I really missed the all-overpowering ""WOW""-sentiment, and that actually already was the case in ""Django Unchained"" as well. All of Tarantino's older movies, up until ""Inglorious Bastards"", were also astounding in terms of originality and imaginative plotting. ""The Hateful Eight"" is basically a very simplistic tale, a sort of whodunit in a stone-cold and unpleasant western environment. In spite of all of Sam Jackson's long monologues and Tim Roth's brilliant Hangman speech, the essence of the plot lies within the question ""who poisoned the coffee?"" ""The Hateful Eight"" contains almost too many highlights to list, and that's the most important conclusion of my viewing. The long and moody opening sequence, slowly turning around the deformed Christ statue, is pure art! In fact, the cinematography throughout the entire film is brilliant and chock-full of ingenious angles; outside in the excruciatingly cold Wyoming winter as well inside in the haberdashery. I think I covered the greatness of the dialogues already, and the violence featuring in the last half hour is also stupendous, with heads getting blown clean off and scumbags puking out all the blood in their bodies. In another interview I read that Tarantino listed two movies as his main inspiration, namely his own ""Reservoir Dogs"" and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". Those two are indeed well represented, but I would definitely add one other title, and I'm sure QT knows I'm right, and that's the obscure but raw and excessively violent Spanish/Italian western ""Cut-Throats Nine"". The original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone sent cold shivers down my spine, but there's another song on the soundtrack that even made me happier. All my life I've been a fan of Roy Orbison, but thanks to Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" I discovered a magnificent song of his that I never heard before. ""I won't be many coming home"" is a fantastic song and ideally fits the tone and content of the film."
" As Tarantino films go, this one's near the bottom
",0.0,0.8657,2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,"The main sensation that one comes away with having watched THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Quentin Tarantino's newest film, is a sense of disappointment. It's not that this is a particularly poor film - it's far better than DEATH PROOF, for example - it's just that it's so, well, average. Tarantino is capable of so much more and you won't find it here. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is an Agatha Christie-style mystery set inside a snowy cabin with a blizzard going on outside and a cast of suspicious characters inside.The story sounds interesting and it is. The best thing about it is Tarantino's direction, which is still second to none and really the only reason to keep watching through some of the worst moments. The worst thing about it is Tarantino's own script, which really needed the services of an editor to turn it into something workable. The whole first hour and a half of this movie is a deathly dull set-up in which very little happens and long stretches of boredom threaten to send the viewer to sleep.I appreciate that Tarantino likes the slow burner, but slow burners need suspense and in that respect THE HATEFUL EIGHT falls far behind similar moments in RESERVOIR DOGS or INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Not only do we have to wait around forever once we get to the cabin, but there's that whole extra first half an hour on the stage coach which is quite ridiculous. Another big problem is a whole half-hour sub-plot involving Bruce Dern's extraneous character which culminates in a crude sexual joke that seems to have been written by Tarantino in the mindset of a teenage boy. All that effort, all that money, and this is the best he can do? Not only that, but it has no relation to the main plot of the film and needed excising, along with Dern himself.Still, there are flashes of the old Tarantino magic here, and the last part of the film, in which things actually start happening and the cast start dying, is good stuff, reminiscent of RESERVOIR DOGS at its best. There are lots of surprisingly gruesome special effects which seem to have been inspired by those in the EVIL DEAD remake and turn this into a horror film in places. Tarantino has also assembled some great actors including Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson, the latter of whom gives a fine performance which is the best in the movie. It's also good to have Tim Roth and Michael Madsen back from the old days. Jennifer Jason Leigh has a difficult part but comes across well and it's only minor performers like the awkward Zoe Ball who disappoint. Kudos too to Walton Goggins, finally excelling in a main role after years and years of bit parts and minor work."

The setup to 'Hateful Eight' is fantastic, with beautiful outdoor shots in snow country, and an interesting concept, characters being added one by one as a bounty hunter stops to pick up those imperiled by an oncoming blizzard. Tarentino assembles a fine cast with Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh among others, and Bruce Dern turns in a great performance. There are some deep moments amidst the violence, Jackson saying in one scene that ""The only time black folks are safe, is when white folks is disarmed"", and Tim Roth's character expressing the thin line justice walks in a speech ending with the line ""For justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice"" in another. I liked how the stories behind each of the characters are gradually revealed, and how the story behind what happened earlier in the haberdashery that everyone is holed up in is told in a flashback chapter. In other words, there's a lot to like here. And yet. And yet. How the story plays out was somehow not completely satisfying, maybe because I felt like it lost focus, and fell back on extreme gore and graphic moments to try to carry the day. I was also not a huge fan of the ending. It's a good film for sure, but not great, or Tarantino's best."
" Ponderous, longwinded, derivative and sadistic - yes, Tarantino's back
",0.4019,0.9402,2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"First of all some figures: The Hateful Eight cost $44m to make and in six months had made $145m - over three times as much. Those are the kind of figures producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein like, and while Quentin keeps the box office cash tills ringing, Bob and Harvey, or whoever else Quentin approaches with his latest script, will carry on saying 'yes, Quentin, of course, Quentin, and can I get you another olive for your martini, Quentin?' His previous two stinkers also made a lot of loot: Django Unchained cost $100m and pretty soon returned $425m worldwide; Inglorious Basterds cost $75m and soon brought in $321m worldwide).Admittedly, those $145m came from someone's pockets, so someone and their friends must like the kind of cack Quentin has been turning out remorselessly since the very good Reservoir Dogs and good, though, not great Pulp Fiction. And you can't argue with such cash figures, you'll be saying. Well, if that's your line, let me remind you of the wisdom to 'eat sh*t, seven trillion flies can't be wrong'. Oh, yes they can.Elsewhere on this site you will find The Hateful Eight lauded to high heaven and given superlative ratings. But you will also see very low ratings and criticism of various kinds. My advice: ignore the fanboys who might well enjoy gratuitous blood and gore as much as our Quentin. Go by what the naysayers have to say. Despite some initial great photography - not Quentin's department though - this is pretty dire.To be fair, I don't think The Hateful Eight is quite as bad as Django Unchained, although it, too, has seams of bargain basement political correctness about race and colour running through it of the kind which is actually just as insulting to blacks. But it also has the same faults: an artlessly contrived plot, a horribly uneven pace, superficially clever dialogue which actually sounds only like superficially clever dialogue and an awfully stagey direction.The Hateful Eight, in fact, comes across as a ham mystery play transferred to the screen by someone who has no idea that film has its own imperatives. Heresy? The boy Quentin doesn't know about film, I say. Well, on the evidence of this flat-footed effort, he certainly seems to have forgotten whatever you insist he once knew.Quentin also manages to elicit from a respectable line-up of actors some pretty wooden performances: they all, even Mr Samuel Jackson, one of my favourite actors, come across as speaking lines from someone's smart script. They all seem to be acting, sometimes acting well, but still acting, and only the director, one Quentin Tarantino, can be blamed for that. He might know how to put together a bloodfest gunfight, but he often seems clueless as to how to give his actors directions.Other reviews such as this one have tended to mention historical inaccuracies and other infelicities. I was surprised to hear one character describe another as 'paranoid' - what, in mid-19th century Wyoming? I don't think so. But my gripes have nothing really much to do with that.My gripes have to do with the boy Quentin's filmmaking: he's just not as good as he obviously thinks he is. Not by a long chalk. The characters are stock characters, most of the films consists of series of one-to-one setpieces and his convoluted plots are only convoluted because that is Quentin's schtick.In The Hateful Eight he even pulls a fast one: two-thirds of the way through we get a narration and a very hamfisted new element is introduced to get the ball rolling again. It's as though busily writing his script he had reached a kind of dead end and didn't quite know where to go next.What Quentin needs is someone to tell him 'this just isn't very good, laddie, try again'. But while those cash tills keep a'ringin that really isn't going to happen.The film is almost two and a half hours long, and I wanted to give up after an hour. I only kept going because I knew I would be writing this review, and it was only fair I saw the lot. On the other hand, if you want to give up after an hour, by all means do so. You will really not miss much at all and might even find something more useful to do. And you will even not have to witness a particularly unpleasant scene where a woman is hanged.By the way: just how did two badly injured men, one of whom couldn't move at all, the other just revived from a fainting fit but who could also barely move manage to rustle up a hanging rope complete with a very professional noose from somewhere and get the hanging done? Oh, and if you do give up - as I advise - you will also be spared a particularly mawkish, not to say dishonest epilogue involving a letter apparently written by Abraham Lincoln to the black character. Oh dear."
" If you love violence and the N word watch this movie
",0.0258,-0.4406,2017-01-06 00:00:00,2,"I hated this movie. The gratuitous use of the N words and the blood-splattering aside, the plot is a drawing room drama with guns and the only remotely interesting character is Jennifer Jason Leigh's. There was such opportunity with these actors and the talent behind the camera, but alas, it was not meant to be. QT is like a teenager who only wants the thrill of a cranium exploding or using a forbidden word. There is not much here that holds one's attention. In fact, despite the richness of the set and excellent lighting, I was still bored by the repetitive dialogue that led nowhere significant and I ended up only noticing the use of the N word. If the inspiration for this film was in fact Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" then it is a miserable fail. The characters simply were not fully realized on a script level. The actors did their best, but could not rescue it from the hands of the naked Emperor-Director; and at three hours - tortured is how I felt by the end, especially with no plot twist worthy of the indulgent film. This is a big thumbs down for me."
" Utter disappointment. Better as a radio show.
",-0.1027,0.9342,2017-01-06 00:00:00,2,"This movie was an utter disappointment. Don't expect it to be an action filled western, it's very much the opposite. Nothing wrong with that, but this story and its intrigues would have done just as good as a story on radio. There is nothing visually needed to tell this story, or very little. It's not like other story heavy movies where visuals are an intricate part of the whole story, like The Usual Suspects which is actually a great example of that. To me not even the conversations between the characters is that much interesting. The characters are good with their personalities, but that is all the suspense there is in this movie."
" Quentin Tarantino as always
",0.0,0.9676,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Not Tarantino's Best work but still epic and very very bloody. He made the movie with only 17 characters, 8 are main as obvious, one is important as side character and the rest are not of big importance. Every one of the 9 character was written in the best details with a chance to rise.Most of people will say that Samuel L. Jackson was the best in the movie but in my opinion it is Walton Goggins, he was really funny and unexpected which made me enjoyed him the best.We can't forget the music which was tremendous but I blame Tarantino for not using it more, it only appeared in very few scene.I enjoyed the movie and my rating is 8.5/10"
" Entertaining. Brutal. Tarantino Excellence!
",0.4926,0.9587,2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"The Hateful Eight is a fantastic film. The sheer brutality of it, no mercy is shown as you can see when Jody Domergue gets his head blow off and When Daisy is hung at the end, critics aren't huge fans but this is definitely worth the watch! Excellent performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell. Although the scene about Marquis getting oral may have been disturbing to some. The Hateful Eight also brings back some of our favorites from Tarantino films like Tim Roth and Michael Madsen from Reservoir Dogs and Kurt Rusell from Death Proof. Great soundtrack, great action, great story. Although not Tarantino's finest, The Hateful Eight is definitely one to watch."
" Tarantino Delivers!!!!
",0.0,0.9737,2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"When I went to see the film The Hateful Eight, this would be my second time watching the film, but this time it will be in Ultra Panavision 70mm. There is not much difference with both films except the fact that there is an overture in the beginning of the film that replaces the previews. There is also a 15 min intermission that takes place around the fifth chapter of the film. Besides those two distinct differences the films are the same. From the beginning of the film the cinematography is incredible. You can immediately notice it's a Tarantino film by the shot. He has a unique style of cinematography that makes his films incredible. The dialogue in this film makes it Oscar worthy for Best Original Screenplay. This film is about how a Bounty Hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) crosses paths with another Bounty Hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) whom both have bounty's. One alive and three dead. They end up riding in a stagecoach together to shelter in Wyoming to beat a blizzard that has arrived. Ruth's bounty is Daisy Domergue with a bounty of $10,000, and he will do what ever he has to do to protect his bounty whom he seeks to hang. On their way to shelter they encounter the new towns sheriff, Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). Mannix seeks a ride on the stagecoach. Upon the arrival of the stagecoach to Minnie's Haberdashery they are greeted by 4 individuals whom they have never seen except one. General Smithers. The General fought against Major Warren in a previous battle. As the story progresses with spectacular dialogue, the unknown individuals are not exactly who they say they are. Which in turn end up poisoning a pot of coffee that Ruth and his stagecoach driver end up drinking. They both die from ingesting the poisonous coffee. This in turn makes Major Warren suspicious of everyone else. Long story short, Daisy Domergue's brother ends up being the mastermind behind the entire gang who are trying to disrupt Ruth's plans of hanging Daisy. Everyone basically ends up dying. In closing, my personal experience viewing a 70mm picture was fantastic. For a film buff to experience this is a treat in its self. The rarity of this also enriches the experience. I personally thought the film was exquisite. Beautifully written with captivating cinematography. If you grew up on Tarantino films than you know what to expect. There are several things that made my film experience better and one of them was the performance of Walton Goggins. His performance as a sheriff should catch the eyes from the Academy for an Oscar consideration. He literally capitalizes his role above all others. Taking part in viewing this masterpiece has been beneficial for me in this class, because it gives me a new appreciation for a lost art. Instead of dreaming of what a 70mm movie would be like with an overture and intermission, I lived it."
" Impressive
",0.5106,-0.9901,2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"I've waited a long time before I watched this movie. It was clear to me that this would be heavier stuff, not so light-footed like Pulp. In this case I wait until I'm in a certain mood, a moment, where also Viscontis Â‚Damned', Herzogs Â‚Aguirre' or 'Apocalypse' would be fine. And now after watching Â‚8' I have to say, yes this moving picture is also about the damned and it's drawn perfectly and consistently. It is definitely entertaining, disturbing and shocking at the same time and never boring or implausible. For me that's pure art.Perhaps there are some in the US they don't like the picture because it's about dark facts of a supposedly great era in history. I recently read about the Trail Of Tears, the Seminoles, the role of Afroamerican People in that conflict and later in the civil war. Yes that's not all glorious events and I can understand some people don't like to be remembered. I had that feeling while watching Â‚Inglorious', because my Grandfather was a German Soldier. And even I know he hated the Nazis (he helped Jews to escape in his trucks) I had some difficulties to accept how partially stupid the Germans where shown in Â‚Bastards'. But - who could blame anybody to do so?! There are countless other massacres in human history and nobody knows if we really will not experience something terrible again. Fear and hate are spreading out all over the world like never before the last 70 years.There is this wooden Jesus statue in the movie and I guess that's not a coincidence. He told us to meet the stranger like meeting him. This movie is about people who do not trust, who dominate and hate each other. So this rough movie is about bloody hell, visually and mental."
" Aggressively antagonistic, repugnant and foul...just what Tarantino's fans have come to expect and welcome
",-0.25,-0.8366,2017-01-01 00:00:00,4,"Writer-director Quentin Tarantino's ""8th film"", as it states in the credits, is aggressively antagonistic, assaultive, repugnant and foul-mouthed...still, this is some people's idea of a good time. Bounty hunter transporting female murderer through Wyoming blizzard by stagecoach in the post-Civil War years picks up two passengers on his way to Red Rock: black bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren, who is traveling with three dead bounties of his own, and Red Rock's new sheriff. They end up snowbound at a way-station with a motley group of lodgers, including a hangman, a cowboy and a former Confederate general. Tarantino, whose script was reportedly inspired by John Carpenter's 1982 splatter-in-the-snow opus ""The Thing"" (which, in turn, appeared to be inspired by Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" from 1979), does employ a few gross-out effects (spurting blood and nasty vomiting shots), yet the personality conflicts of the travelers are actually more disgusting (forget caring about any of these horrible people, the only interest they elicit is due to the strong ensemble acting, not the writing). Tarantino's belligerent sense of humor rears its head on occasion (and, in this story's context, is welcomed), though the film's 182-minute running time is self-defeating, particularly with a ""Chapter Five"" prologue clocking in late at the two-hour mark. Robert Richardson's excellent cinematography keeps the film visually interesting (which is imperative, particularly since we're snowbound in a cabin for a hellishly long stretch), but Ennio Morricone's ominous score misses the mark. ** from ****"
