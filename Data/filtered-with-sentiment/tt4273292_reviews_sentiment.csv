" Such a good story
",0.4404,-0.4444,2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,"The fact that this movie is 1) Persian and 2) centered in a warzone and 3) a very real historical event, the Iraq War, really cemented this as a really nice movie for me. It wasn't very scary for me (it doesn't feel like that was the point) but the characters were well developed, the scares did get me on the few occasions the movie attempted them, and overall I enjoyed it more than most horror films out there."
" Excellent production...
",0.5719,0.4576,2021-03-20 00:00:00,9,"Adorable meeting of countries to make a horror film, which works well, in the midst of social criticism, machismo, reports of the war, which alone haunts, I loved the dark climate, the demon Djinn (Aladin was one) quoted in the Qur'an , scary time, sneaky time, perfect performance of the mother and daughter duo, the dialogues, interactions, everything very engaging, the drama, the missile, the dream of being a doctor, everything so masterfully involved, intertwined in terror, perfect, photography, excellent production."
" Unique setting for a horror movie, and it's actually good.
",-0.2023,-0.1857,2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Very well paced and unsettling. There are a couple of cheap scares and the ending is abrupt but not terrible by any means. Those are really the only negatives I can think of. Whilst it is essentially your typical haunting/ghost type movie the setting also just adds a new layer to the horror. This is a movie well worth watching, maybe not quite as powerful as His House but it's up there for sure. I think anyone else who has watched this would agree that we need more horror movies set in the middle east!"
" An effective Horror and a compelling historical drama.
",0.0772,-0.985,2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Underrated, visually striking and compelling example of what overhyped movies like the American ""Us"" should have been.
There isn't a single piece out of place in this movie. It's a horror movie that manages to agitate our primordial fears as much as our outrage for the slow descent of a country into the abyss of religious fanaticism and extreme misogyny.
The gradual fall into the uncontrollable chaos of the paranormal curse that envelops the most sacred of the nuclear family spaces, the house, mirrors the metaphorical fall into an unreasonable political chaos dominated by the lunacy of men.
Two women, mother and daughter are progressively abandoned by all the social layers that are supposed to protect them: Their husband/father, the institutions, their friends and even their neighbors.
Left to fend for themselves in an impossible and unfair fight against the overwhelming physical destruction of war and the unforgiving incorporeal evil of demons. They are the most powerful and unfathomable of heroes."
" not for me
",0.0,-0.57,2021-01-08 00:00:00,4,"This is a generally well-made movie. i was into it for a while, but i was so unsatisfied when it finished. pretty creepy with a few scary moments. fairly low entertainment factor (1 viewing, 1/4/2021)"
" Bad. Bad. Bad.
",-0.8885,-0.838,2021-01-06 00:00:00,2,I can't believe the positive reviews. This is one of the worst horror movies that I've ever seen. It's not scary. It's not interesting. It's not well-made. It's painful to watch.
" Not a horror movie, only watch if you're looking for drama
",0.4585,-0.9943,2020-12-13 00:00:00,6,"I'm sorry to all those pretentious ""film critics"" out there, but this is not a good movie. This would be so much *much* better as a film if it stayed in one lane. The acting and cinematography are amazing, but the story and ending ruin the overall experience.Here is why it is not a good movie:
SPOILERSThis movie you can interpret in two ways. Either the supernatural exists, or it's all in her head. Yes the film makes it a point to blur the lines a bit, but that doesn't alleviate the film's requirement for MAKING SENSE.Other reviewers give the movie a high score because it has substance. That's fair enough, but when you introduce supernatural ghosts, the substance is diluted.In this case, you can dig the statement it's saying about how the clashing of the political landscape, tragedies of war, and the historical culture has affected the lives of their women. But if you accept the interpretation that the ghosts/Djinn exist and are haunting the family, all of the social commentary undertones become heavily diluted. Is the message of the movie really about how war causes ghosts/Djinn to spawn and haunt the local people? Is that the kind of bold statement the movie is making? If you take that route, then the movie loses half it's value.Then what if you interpret the movie as no ghosts/Djinn, and that the hauntings were all in her head? Well first, you have to explain how multiple different characters saw the same apparitions (neighbors, the daughter). But that doesn't really matter. The problem is, if it was all in her head, then the last 20 minutes of the movie is completely pointless. All the struggles with illusions and apparitions give the film no additional purpose. The apparitions, the alluding's to the supernatural, the dreams, the creepy boy, all of it was just there as eye candy to get the horror audience interested since they had little semblance of any symbolism. If you go with that interpretation, the movie just lost another significant portion of its value.And that's exactly the problem with this movie, the elements of horror have no relevance with its statement, which makes the movie either a silly statement about how wars spawn ghosts, or a drama on war with some scenes of ghosts spliced in here and there."
" Brilliant entwinement of real-life horror and the supernatural
",0.0258,0.8805,2020-11-09 00:00:00,9,"This one surprised me in the best way possible. The setting of an ongoing war is terrifying by itself, and when an eerie legends turns out to be real, things quickly turn even darker. It is done very tastefully, and a couple of jumpscares even managed to catch me off guard (and that rarely happens). This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a good paranormal flick."
" Cringe main actress
",0.0,-0.7852,2020-11-01 00:00:00,4,"The mother was behaving as a spoilt negative Nancy from beginning to the end, it was extremely irritating. The calm collected daugher was a total contrast to her immature rude mean mother. I understand this was part of the story but it was awful to see a parent behave in such a manner to their own child. A little over the top with the meanness from the mother, otherwise just a time filler movie."

" War of a story!
",-0.636,0.298,2020-10-30 00:00:00,8,This film using the conflict of Iran and Iraq into the story helped create the image that the little girl was imagining the whole thing. To help forget that the world outside is cruel. As the movie it gets creepier with where her favorite stuffed animal is. Many time throughout you have a sense that her mom is so concerned about herself that she can not protect her child. I felt that the Babadook was going to come out. I really enjoyed this movie.
" A haunting, intelligent film for an educated film audience

" ""Under the Shadow""
",0.0,0.6597,2020-10-17 00:00:00,7,"Great performances and refreshing scares. Definitely has the same vibe as the movie, ""The Babadook"", focusing more on a restrained relationship between a mother and a child."
" THIS IS SCARY.
",-0.4939,0.3434,2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,"This is scary. It really got my heart racing. I do feel the payoff in this movie is good, but could have possibly been better and maybe could have been a bit longer. The combination of horror and social themes against its political background: Awesome. I didn't miss the cultural and religious symbolism, which created a unique atmosphere for a horror film."
" Much more to this film
",0.0,-0.9612,2020-09-01 00:00:00,9,"So many people are saying they didn't like this because it wasn't really ""horror"". While that statement in itself is true, it is to an extent. Horror itself can be defined in different forms (fear, disgust and utter shock) This film delivers that different something. The main lead is living the constant fear and anxiety during the iran- Iraq conflict. Stress and trauma are no joke and what they can do to a person's state of mind is terrifying. If you want a standard, pure horror film, yea look elsewhere. You won't be able to appreciate the film for what it is if that's what you go into looking for. Give it a shot with an open mind and see what you think! *Shout out to that sheet scene. I just loved how it looked."

Overall I think this is the better of the two movies and it freaked the hell out of me.I love how they play off the idea of the home, a sanctuary from the outer world and oppressive regime, becoming increasingly unsafe due to the growing danger inside all the while war pushes closer outside.

" One-Line Review: Under the Shadow / Solid, Inventive Horror / 7 Stars
",-0.4767,0.8641,2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,I don't think I have seen a more solid build-up like the one in Under the Shadow that gives you a great horror time with enough jumpscares that you don't see coming and a very peculiar attempt at creating thrills through war-based symbolism. TN.
" There's very different movie in there somewhere that they maybe should have dug for.
",0.0,-0.4374,2020-02-29 00:00:00,7,"What strikes me most about this movie is how it feels sort of like two different movies jammed together.This so could have simply been a poignant drama about the struggles of a woman in a very particular time and place: a country struggling with its own identity, but with all ambitious females getting lost int he cracks. This is what it feels like at first and to an extent I suppose it doesn't stop being that movie. It's just that the supernatural horror elements now seem adventitious. Couldn't have this story have worked without the political turmoil diluting the narrative? Maybe it's a thematic thing I totally missed.Well, in all fairness, the whole thing is a fairly well imagined and visualized slow burn that should have kept its cards a little closer to its chest for longer but still works. The mute child should have had a lot more screen time.Nothing particularly new or exciting but if you go in expecting an adequate but not brilliantly made horror, you'll get an unusually competent tale of the uncanny in an exotic setting that still has some of the bad habits of other movies."
" Spirit??
",0.264,0.3321,2020-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Very spooky movie. Great Islamic presence there, the spirit is of course a representative of the injustice of the Muslim women in that culture. Majestic."

",-0.3182,-0.1195,2020-01-18 00:00:00,1,I don't recommend this movie. Waste of time. Glad it was on Netflix so I could skip half way through this and not miss anything.
" Confident, compelling and, most importantly, creepy.
",0.7713,0.8325,2020-01-07 00:00:00,8,"'Under The Shadow (2016)' is an extremely confident feature film debut, a well-conceived and somewhat unconventional horror with a unique setting and a solid subtext. It manages to be both properly psychological and overtly supernatural, leaving little to no doubt regarding the spirits it sees haunt its protagonist and her daughter. It's the underlying fears - about motherhood, oppression and war - which make the experience as layered and effective as it is, draping each and every scene with an almost omnipresent anxiety and an enigmatic portent. Refreshingly, the film is actually quite scary. It doesn't necessarily shake you to your core or keep you awake at night in an existential crisis, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat fearing for its core characters. It lacks an overabundance of cheap 'jump' moments, instead building genuine suspense and allowing its tension to explode only sporadically. The thing feels perfectly paced, escalating to a potentially silly finale that somehow does nothing but leave your heart in your mouth. It's all very well done, consistently compelling right from the start. It's an entertaining experience with strong characters, a pacy plot and several superb scares. 8/10"
" Stressful wartime drama
",-0.5106,0.9478,2019-12-24 00:00:00,6,"So, this film if really well made, but not necessarily well written. It does a great job at setting up the world of the characters and gives you reasons to care about them. When the creepy stuff starts happening, though, I was left wanting. Like others have said, it's more of a tense drama than an atmospheric thriller. The stress of this woman's life in the real world was more interesting than the scares; if they had just made the movie about that, maybe they could have found an ending that felt like a payoff."
" Good methaphors

It's a show about a wife, forced to stay at home, who gets ruffed up by a blanket. The end."
" How is this getting good reviews?
",0.4404,0.9696,2019-09-25 00:00:00,3,"So, movie, you're telling me that the main characters have to deal with bombs dropped on their head on a daily basis, but somehow ghosts are a bigger issue? And they can't leave the apartment like EVERYONE ELSE because the girl's doll is missing? They have a perfectly good reason to leave and not get blown into smithereens by something VERY REAL, but the girl needs to find her doll? How can you claim fantasy creatures are a bigger issue than missilies, even missiles going through the roof without detonating? It's ridiculous.
On the plus side - certain shots were cool and the design of the ghosts were at times creative. The direction was good as well, but it's difficult to take it serious when it's priorities are way off. Had it been depression or divorce instead of BOMBS BLOWING UP THE CITY, then it would have been more fitting with the theme of the djinns attracted to misery and not as distracting."
" Decent drama, weak horror
",-0.765,-0.8995,2019-07-31 00:00:00,4,"The unique setting was refreshing, and it was interesting to see the protagonist struggle with being suffocated by familial, societal, and even supernatural pressures.But... the horror aspects were much weaker than reviews led me to believe. I don't think it had any tension, effective scares (unless you count being startled by a noise), or even a strong plot. The biggest flaw is the reason for the protagonist's entire motivation for staying. Seriously, if someone tried to pitch me that idea I would tell them to try harder. By the time the daughter screamed for her doll for what felt like the 50th time, I could only think about how I would have taped the thing to her hand to stop her nonsense.Don't get me wrong, I don't mind drama or social commentary in my horror films. In fact those topics can often add complexity and dimension. This, however, is not enough horror to be a horror film but with too much horror to be a family drama."

",0.0,-0.9178,2019-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I watched it on Netflix which had it dubbed over into English which I found quite distracting at first. I usually prefer to hear the emotion in the character's voices and don't mind subtitles but I got over it quite quickly. As a horror film it is slow and builds tension very well with some legitimately good jump scares.
As a drama film it is even better, showing the fragile mental state of a lone Mother trying to keep it together in the midst of war torn Iran.
There are some genuinely creepy moments but I found the ending to be quite abrupt."

" The liberation of Middle Eastern women
",0.0,-0.5568,2019-05-03 00:00:00,7,"The tension and the fear in the film hide a metaphor about the role of women in middle East. If you pay attention, the ghosts in the film are purely middle eastern fabrics, that recall the veil that women are forced to wear. They are not escaping from ghosts, they're escaping from their veils.Under the Shadow pictures a constant fight of a women and her daughter to escape from those fabrics that hound them aggressively and will probably accompany them the rest of their life.The ending scene, where the daughter extends her helping hand to her mother so they can finally escape from the ghosts, can be understood as the hope for the new generation of middle eastern girls and their liberation."

",0.0,-0.9345,2019-04-13 00:00:00,1,"If you are from middle-east and if you are an horror fan, you will find this film pretty boring. It is a typical middle-eastern Djin story. The story is pretty superficial. Taking advantage of the war time issues without giving any kind of deep messages. Some dare to call it ""psychological horror"" since the background is about the Iran-Iraq war but trust me the war has very little to do with the film because it only has jump-scare moments. The legends and stories behind the ""djins"" (or however it was translated to other languages) are very superficial and lacks development. There is a huge potential in such stories and all those middle eastern superstitions, beliefs and culture could be reflected much more detailed and complete.In the end sadly I feel like I just wasted an hour and a half on a mediocre horror film that just uses ""djinns"" instead of ghosts..."

" One of the best horror films ever!
",0.2003,-0.9785,2019-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Under The Shadow doesn't only terrify on the supernatural scale, but with the fear brought on by war as well which makes it feel more realistic.It doesn't try to be scary by over using scares or excessive amounts of special effects. It plays it very subtle, making the moments of fear pack a punch.Terror creeps in as we see a mother and her daughter slowly becoming the only residents in a torn down building due to the ongoing war outside.The mixture of isolation, war, and a supernatural force makes this film genuinely scary and one of the best ever.I highly recommend this."
" A rarity - a Middle Eastern horror movie!
",-0.6114,-0.2934,2019-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Great idea for a horror thriller, involving an undetonated missile in an apartment building, a djinn, and the Iran-Iraq war. Alternatively terrifying and mysterious, and it references the second-citizen status of women in the Middle East. Run with your child, screaming because you saw a demon? You better have your head covered! Creatively imagined and strongly directed by Anvari. I did feel that the mother character was a wee bit more obnoxious than was necessary (stress or not), but overall it's a fine film."
" Slow and badly dubbed
",-0.4767,-0.31,2019-02-03 00:00:00,2,"Very slow, boring and plodding... basically, a dirge!Particularly due to the bad dubbing and its amateurish voice acting, I find it difficult to give this a truly objective appraisal.Although the dubbing accent was (general) American, near the beginning the little girl referred to her mother as (British) ""mummy"" rather than (American) ""mommy"". Immediate conflict for the viewer.As for the voice acting, it was stilted, lacking in truth and simply not believable... the American accent just seemed inappropriate and just did not seem to fit. This is true for most dubbed movies. Probably the best, and most professional, dubbing lies with the Italian film industry. I say the best although I am still 'anti-dubbing'.The essence of an actor (although there are exceptions, e.g. silent movies, mime etc) is his voice. For truth in acting, we need to experience the match in his total, true physicality of expression... voice with locomotion with poise with characteristics with traits etc. With dubbing, there is always an ill-fitting piece of the jigsaw. Something just does not gel... and this is the major problem with this movie.However, the film does offer a few (although over-the-top) scary moments later on - perhaps from around 40mins before the end. These are marred, though, by being somewhat excessive and over-the-top, and also by the lead actress (Narges Rashidi) simply not being scared enough... she simply comes across as - let's say - too brave.Overall disappointing, especially considering that one of my favourite critics, Mark Kermode, rated it favourably."

While it was interesting to watch and it had a couple of creepy moments, I can't say that this was a ""scary"" movie. I like that this was about Djinn. I don't think there are many movies where the antagonist happen to be Djinn and I'd like to see more films with this theme.This is a well made film and I thought the acting was decent. The fact that this is set in the Middle East makes for an interesting watch as customs and beliefs are different. I would've liked to have seen more character building on the Djinn. There wasn't much describing origins, motives and related phenomenon. It's not what I would consider to be an awesome horror flick but it is better than just average. I probably won't watch it again but I am glad I watched it at least once."

" A nice slow burner...
",0.4215,0.074,2019-01-07 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie although it had flaws, it was an unusual take on the genre. To be honest it was hard to label this as a horror but there really isn't anywhere else to put it. I won't go into the story line, others have done that adequately.If you want a big hollyweird blockbuster, this isn't for you, no big bangs, big jump scares and no blood and gore. But you will jump, trust me. In fact the djinn (look it up) doesn't make an appearance for quite a way into the movie. This kind of begs the question, why did I like it? It's a slow building movie and, as a westerner I needed to be put into the culture to understand the main character Shideh, the mother (Narges Rashidi). Set in Tehran in the 1980s, the film takes us through Narges attempt to get back to university to continue her studies to become a doctor. You see the knock backs by the administration using the politically charged reasons of the time. Her husband is drafted as a field doctor to the front line to explain his absence. You also get to see the way women are treated as second class citizens and the trouble they go to to present one persona to the world but are completely different in private. For example, Shideh works out to a Jane Fonda VHS tape but the VCR must be hidden when the glazier calls. Couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity from a westerner's point of view, but a sad indictment on the culture at the time.Furthering the atmosphere of tension is the Iraq-Iran war creeping into Tehran so there is an oppressive feeling from not only the Religious fanatics but also the encroaching war. Add into that the appearance of the Djinn and you have a unique setting for a horror film. I won't tell you what the Djinn looks like, you'll have to watch for yourself but it somehow fit the time and place very well.The star of the movie is Dorsa (played by Avin Manshadi). What a performance by such a young girl and her first major role too. There was one scene where she really took me by surprise when she stood up to her mother. She played the petulant child role to perfection and she had some major face time on the screen. Her looks could either melt your heart or freeze you to the spot. Brilliant.Like I said a slow burner, but the build up worked well. Not without flaws but an original setting and great to see a horror from a country other than the US and it wasn't pushed in your face as they usually are.It's a 7 for location, atmosphere and DORSA."
" Not a Horror film at all, but still excellent!
",0.8096,-0.9309,2019-01-01 00:00:00,6,"I fancy myself a devout Horror enthusiast, so I was very happy to expand my horizons by trying a Persian one. That, and the trailer and available description on Netflix intrigued me. While the scenario of ""single parents attempting to protect child/children from malevolent supernatural entity"" has been done often enough to become a cliché of sorts - it rarely gets boring (when executed right).Unfortunately for me, Under The Shadow if far from meeting my personal standards of a Horror film, set by years of Hollywood conditioning as they may be. Aside from a few well-placed and finely utilized jump scares (which are still and forever will be a cheap trick and nothing more) and the presence of said malevolent supernatural entity - there is nothing scary about the film and hardly anything to justify its Horror tag. Now, keep in mind that besides jump scares I'm also not a fan of excessive blood, pointless gore of torture porn. I have quite typical demands from Horror films, mainly that they should invoke certain sensations of fear and discomfort. Under The Shadow does do that, but at the bare minimum level. Having a supernatural spirit as an ambiguous antagonist doesn't qualify as Horror more than ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"" does (a deliberate exaggeration of course).Having said all that - Under the Shadow is an excellent film as a profound anthropological documentation of Persian culture and social patterns following the religious revolution and during the Iran-Iraq war. The presentation of the Djins, the conflicted woman of science and medicine forced to comply with primitive religious laws of female degradation and the neighborly cooperative coping with living under missile fire are all described and presented beautifully. The acting is superb by all characters, especially young Avin Manshadi (Dorsa) showing very impressive talent. As a cultural piece, Under The Shadow is a rare and remarkable gem.All in all, I personally believe anyone watching this film in expectations or hopes of Horror would be quite disappointed. It would take active effort to feel any form of fear while watching, aside from the physiological forced reactions to startling jump scares. However, anyone looking for a compelling story of family, cultural society and life during war in the context of Iranian life would be greatly entertained. 9 for film, 3 for Horror, an overall average of 6 and an honest recommendation to forget about scares and simply have fun watching."

" Works as social commentary. Not horror.
",0.4585,-0.3489,2018-11-02 00:00:00,7,"I decided to see this film based on the glowing reviews on this site. All I can say is that it is an interesting drama, but definitely not a horror film. What is interesting about it is that it is set in 1980's Iran during their war with Iran. The main character is Shideh. An Intelligent woman who wants to finish her studies but is not allowed to because in her youth she was a left wing protester. She is married with a young daughter but is frustrated that she can't fulfill her dream of being a doctor.She stays in her home after her husband is called to serve in the war against his wishes. The Iraquis are firing missiles into Tehran and wants Shideh to go with their daughter to his parents house. She refuses. Then along with living thru the fear of sirens going off and rushing to the bomb shelter in her apartment building. After that she and her daughter start experiencing scary events. Her daughter Dorsa loses her doll and begins to get sick. Dorsa insists that someone took her doll but Shideh doesn't believe her and frantically searches the house for the doll. She begins to experience hauntings herself. I really won't give much more details but all I have to say is that even though I was interested in what was happening the film doesn't work as horror. It is obvious that this film had a minuscule budget so the supernatural elements are handled efficiently but don't really add a sense of dread that they are meant to.Ultimately, this film is a drama that uses the supernatural to comment on how women are badly treated in Iran. In that vein, the film works. Mainly because of the performances of the mother and daughter. Shideh is obviously an intelligent woman and feels oppressed by her society. But the film is not terribly scary or creepy. I appreciate that the film is set in a place that is not usually seen in this type of story, but it's horror elements are too familiar to be truly effective."

" An horror mature and deep that has a purpose over the one of scare
",-0.6249,-0.9924,2018-07-06 00:00:00,8,"From a quick reading of the plot and the poster the first impression may be that of another paranormal themed horror of mediocre quality but if you add the country of origin (Iran) and a difficult and traumatic setting like that in this country during the war against Iraq between 1980 and 1988, then you immediately understand that probably it is not the usual horror.
And in fact, despite some elements that refer to that horror cinema already seen and reviewed, used and abused in Hollywood, ""Under the shadow"" demonstrates with much courage to be much more, something that the genre served with a lot of need, a film that is not limited only to scare, to anguish and disturb (and all this does so optimally, even if not impeccable in the first half) but that tries to give to everything a meaning that is profound, how much enough, but above all that it can give to the various jumpscare and to the dark and disturbing atmosphere an purpose that goes beyond that of instilling fear and fright.
Babak Anvari with his very mature and in many moments, as already said, courageous director gives the film the gift of acting as a metaphor, not excessively veiled, that criticizes the society of that period but has not undergone many changes over the years including the current ones, a cold, cynical, disrespectful and claustrophobic society, especially for women, the absolute protagonists of this movie.
Really extraordinary a scene in which the terror in the form of veil imprisons almost to stifle or otherwise separate the mother with her daughter, to indicate a society that rejects the unconventional ideals of the first and that tries to protect the child with its own restrictions so as to remove her from the mother and bring her closer to the unfair want of a society too much influence from a religion that in radicalism to women takes away more than giving."
" Best art-house horror movie
",0.128,0.8308,2018-06-22 00:00:00,9,"I am a fan of horror and every time if there is a good horror movie I'm in for it and especially if it is an art house horror. Not too far just a month ago I saw The Babadook and I was like this is the best horror movie by far. But now after watching under the shadow I'm forced to change my mind. This is the best horror movie I have seen to date.So the movie takes place during the Iran Iraq war. There is a family a husband, wife and their only daughter. Their daughter she is afraid of jinns (ghosts). And husband is a doctor. This woman who is playing the lead she is very free-living women she has a VCR at home she is doing exercises in morning wearing jeans and tops, she is not wearing the outfit that every other Iranian women is. So then her husband is transferred to another city which is right in the middle of War so he has to go there but he do not take them with him because it's not safe. Now this woman is living alone and she has to take care of her daughter on her own now. And thing starts to get worse as by the time it's not just daughter anymore she herself is seeing things now.So what makes Under The Shadow a stand out among the rest? Well it's pretty much everything. So this is not just a movie about some Supernatural stuff going on, it's way more than that. Story of the film takes place in the time when there was Iran Iraq war going on, and that makes the atmosphere of the film more intense. In the film people are doing their normal stuff and suddenly there is a blast somewhere around and that shakes you from the core. its hard to believe that it's Babak Anvari's first film. Settings he used in film the camera angles the sound design the framing it seem like he is the master of horror.There is one scene in the movie when the woman who is playing the lead she is lying on the bed and camera angle is tilt and then she gets up and now she is sitting on the bed and that tilt camera moves with her and now the camera angle is straight and then the camera moves slightly to left and her daughter is standing next to her bed. This was really very well done.Editing of the movie is really good this is not a really long movie it's just 80-85 minutes long and that's perfect. Pacing of the movie is more than perfect you won't be bored for a single second it will grip you from the start and will not leave you until it's over."

Narges Rashidi was excellent as the stubborn mother - upset with the world because she was denied finishing her medical studies due to her involvement during a revolution. While their town is still under attack from Iraq, the tension inside her apartment slowly builds from suspenseful to creepy to terrifying. There's a lot of unexpected jump-scares, and some really great visuals. Absolutely brilliant."

The lead role was very annoying, reckless and stubborn. Well, if she was meant to be it, then it was a good acting. Because you'll realize all the troubles and problems occurred because she was being so selfish and self-centered.
As the story, it lead to nowhere. Like i said before, it had no plot. Well, the conflict between the lead role and another character was forced, it was actually no conflict at all, but since she's an annoying person so she had to be the person who was always correct and ""the victim"".
The story went slow with some unnecessary scene, it seemed to be put there only to add the length of the movie. It's a boring drama that put a failed-horror flick to gain rating.
No need to add this to your watch-list."
" Terrifying unearthly circumstances during a war-torn Iran
",-0.5719,-0.9875,2018-04-04 00:00:00,7,"Babak Anvari's directorial debut is something not to miss, if you are a true horror fan. A Persian-language horror film is not something that frequently gets the media attention of the Western world.""Under the Shadow"" takes place in the 80's during the post-revolutionary war between Iran and Iraq. It follows a family of three living in a Tehran bombarded by missile attacks. The husband is a medical doctor who is called up to the war front to help the wounded, leaving behind his wife and young daughter. 
The attacks before more and more intense, but yet Shideh, now alone, does not want to leave together with her daughter, Dorsa, to her parents and instead chooses to remain in the apartment building that's crumbling from all the bombing. If the fear of the ongoing war was not enough, a mysterious being called Djinn begins to haunt their house. This leaves them with absolutely no choice at this point, if they leave the house enemy soldiers or bombing could be their demise, if they stay at home the evil spirit might claim their souls.You can actually feel Shideh's desperation as she and her daughter get cornered constantly. Apart from the terrifying atmosphere the film also adds excitement with one or two jump scares.The premise is quite interesting from a foreigner's point of view and to sense the Iranian life and torment during the post-revolutionary war is staggering. The social subtexts the writers are implying is food for thought, leaving the impression of a confined paradise that Shideh had in her apartment packed with a VCR or casual clothing, things that were dangerous to possess.""Under the Shadow"" is a good horror film that doesn't rely on Hollywood formulas. It's definitely an interesting entry from the Middle East film industry."
" Iranian ghost story
",-0.3182,-0.3827,2018-03-07 00:00:00,7,"Set in Teheran during the Iraqi raids of the Eighties, Babak Anvari's debut is an effective supernatural horror film. Premise is simple: a mother and a daughter are trapped in a house haunted by malevolent ghostly entities. The film creates an ominous atmosphere with a good use of sound (and silence) and some creepy jump scares. It's never groundbreaking or exceptional, but it's definitely competent.The unusual setting is interesting and well-integrated into the plot. The ongoing conflict justifies the usual objection to the haunted house scenario (""why don't they just leave?"") and provides further elements of tension and social commentary; for example, there is an unsettling scene where the mother rushes outside seeking help and law enforcements threaten her for not wearing veils. This elevates the movie above more conventional stuff like The Innkeepers or the American remake of The Grudge.6,5/10"

This one by far is the best horror movie I've ever seen. I made an imdb account solely to review this movie so that others can experience it. The characters are realistic, and I'd rather not spoil the plot but it's certainly not your run of the mill evil spirits movie. Also, if you are watching on netflix or any movie that has language options, I'd highly recommend watching it in Persian because the other languages are dubbed and very poorly acted with unnatural intonation.

A 90 year old Catholic priest could have put more flare into the voice acting than this woman. still that aside i just could keep watching it was so boring. And yes I'll admit i turned it off after 20 min but looking at the other bad reviews I'm glad i did. I watch everything horror but this didn't seem like it was going anywhere scary and the mother even without the voice over of a board old nun with coffee breath is so unlikable.bitch to her husband a horrible mother to her child, as said i didn't get to far in but she probably deserved it and maybe if she was nicer ghosts would want to mess with her.

Basically set in the 1980s, during the war between the Islamic post-revolutionary Iran and Iraq, former medical student Shideh (Narges Rashidi) cannot resume her studies because of her involvement with student leftist groups. Returning home, Shideh gets rid of most of her old medical textbooks, apart from a book of medical physiology given to her by her deceased mother. War is intensifying, Shideh's husband Iraj (Bobby Naderi), a doctor called by the military and assigned to an area of heavy fighting, insists she should take her daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi) with her to stay with her parents and be safe, but Shideh refuses to leave, Dorsa is upset to see her father leave, Iraj promises her that her favourite doll Kimia will protect her. A new boy moves in with his cousins, the Ebrahimi family, his parents were killed in an attack, during a shelling he whispers something to Dorsa and gives her a charm, she tells her mother the boy warned her of an evil spirit called a Djinn, and that the charm will protect her. Shideh throws the charm away visits Mrs. Ebrahimi, who informs her that the boy has been mute ever since the death of his parents, soon Dorsa gets a fever and has a number of nightmares, Shideh is also haunted by bad dreams. During another shelling, a missile strikes their building, an upstairs neighbour dies of a heart attack, Kimia goes missing in the commotion, Dorsa's behaviour becomes increasingly disturbed and erratic, she insists someone took Kimia, that there is a strange presence, and that Kimia is somewhere on the upper floor. The neighbours gradually leave to get away from the fighting, Mrs. Ebrahami (Aram Ghasemy) warns Shideh about djinns, explaining their ability to possess humans and that they steal beloved personal items from their victims, then the Ebrahamis leave as well, leaving Shideh and Dorsa as the only two inhabitants left in the building. Shideh's nightmares get worse, and she finds her personal items are disappearing, one of her scary visions is of a floating chador moving like a ghost, Dorsa admits seeing the same visions, but she claims that the ghost wants to help her find Kimia. Shideh finally wants to leave to go to the house of husband's parents, but Dorsa refuses to leave until Kimia is found, after receiving a strange phone call, Shideh does find Kimia, but the doll is mutilated, this upsets Dorsa. Shideh promises Dorsa that they will escape, but the Dorsa she goes down to the shelter with is an apparition, she goes back to the house and rescues the real Dorsa, before they are stopped and attacked by the chador apparition. Shideh urges Dorsa to get out, the floor begins to suck her down, but Dorsa rescues her and the two get away to the car, they drive away to Iraj's parents, but it is revealed that Kimia's detached head was left behind and Shideh's medical textbook is still in the djinn's possession, this implies they may harassed again. Also starring Arash Marandi as Dr. Reza, Behi Djanati Atai as Pargol, Hamid Djavadan as Mr. Fakur and Soussan Farrokhnia as Mrs. Fakur. Rashadi's performance is empathetic and powerful, there are a few scenes where you probably see something, but most of the terror comes from the claustrophobia, the wartime setting, dramatic sounds and your mind playing tricks on you, it is an interesting alternative to a haunted house movie, a creepy and well made psychological horror. It won the BAFTA for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for Babak Anvari, and it was nominated for Outstanding British Film of the Year. Very good!"

I have to say I really enjoyed this film. It's genuinely creepy and made me jump a couple of times, which isn't something that often happens to me as I've watched horror movies nearly all my life and have become desensitized by them. The external threat of the war where a bomb might literally drop on them at any second and the internal threat that some unseen force has targeted this mother and daughter for whatever insidious purpose the Djinn might have really struck a cord with me. It made me feel uneasy for the mother and daughter; the performances from Narges Rashidi and Avin Manshadi respectively are brilliant. You really believe they could be mother and daughter. The director slowly builds the tension as the movie progresses and overall this horror movie is just well executed. Which comes together to make for a powerful experience for the viewer. Maybe if this was just another run of the mill Hollywood horror film, then maybe it wouldn't be as good? I can't answer that. But I can't help feeling the setting, the social and historical commentary that plays a part in this film's narrative really elevated this film to another level and I would highly recommend you watch this film for all horror fans out there who like a good ghost story."

The setting is an apartment house, with frequent black outs and siren warnings of bombardment by an enemy army, which creates an atmosphere of unrelieved anxiety. The family drama drags on a little long, with far too much dialogue, and the spookiness should have been introduced sooner - but that's my only real criticism.If you're tired of jump scares then do check this out - there are half a dozen delivered with great skill, and I think the secret is in the sound design and the half-glimpsed manifestations. The sense of a waking-dream expresses the mother's anxiety in a much more effective way than the similar story of The Babadook, although the stressed out exchanges do become a little wearing in this one too. One effect, under the bed with the figure in the blue coat, looked ridiculous - but maybe I mistook the image.Performances are good, and the photography mixes things up nicely. Music is good too, but the outstanding element is the sound design.Overall: Real spooky, with a few flaws."

It was borderline to me getting completely annoyed by her. And that would not help the cause of the movie. But it was just there to set up the character and some of the things that do happen during the course of the movie.But the movie does get of after a bumpy start (if you see it like me). And after that the ride you are taking, is really taking you places. Pure horror and many scenes that will freeze you to the bone. It's psychological and it does things to your mind you may not expect it to do. Having said that, you have to be open minded to many things.

I know horror movies aren't the best at chasing the realistic side of things, but this one didn't even try.As far as actual scare tactics, I didn't even feel a sense the daughter was fully possessed or even under some spell, which is what made other spirit movies horrifying to me (i.e. babadook). The ghost itself didn't even seem to be malevolent, and because I didn't feel any pressing danger, I couldn't even allow myself to feel tense or scared.For what it was, it was an okay done movie, acting all around was decent, only gold star goes to the daughter who really knocked it out of the park. Is it scary? No. Is it a good commentary on the political nature of women in the middle east? sure. Would I recommend it to a friend?

This great horror movie is the tangible proof that the making of a really scary movie doesn't need massive budget, rivers of blood or huge special effect. The 80's setting was completely reconstructed ( the fitness work out has been a jump in time!), the actors really realistic, the atmosphere is distressing,dark,tense and full of bad omen.I jumped on my sofa 2 or 3 times and I had continuous goose bumps....I even forgot that Iwas watching a movie with subtitles.

" A uniquely set good ghost story
",0.1531,-0.8566,2017-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Greetings from Lithuania.So when you think that movie makers have set their horror movies in all possible settings yet, something like ""Under the Shadow"" (2016) comes along. This is good horror / ghost story set in a totally unique place, a war-torn Tehran of the 1980s. Sure there is a house and a creepy basement, but hey, non horror movie won't work without those ""ingredients"". ""Under the Shadow"" is a very well directed, written and superbly played horror / drama. This is not a horror fest from start till finish, as a horror story kicks in in around mid of the movie, but by then we get to know the characters, setting and drama surrounding them. By then this movie worked for me as a good drama, but when the supernatural things started - they got me total by surprise and that what made this into a very good little ghost / horror story.Overall, if you love horror movies, ""Under the Shadow"" is not to be missed on. It has unique setting, unique take on a ""ghost"" and enough chills to make you turn then light on going into the bathroom after credits of this movie will start rolling. It did for me at least."
" It is a most Sinister Space we Occupy when Daring to go ""Under the Shadow""
",-0.4005,-0.978,2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"There is more than meets the eye going' on in the unconventional Iranian horror/thriller ""Under the Shadow"". One whole HELLUVA lot more.The setting is a Tehran apartment house during the late stages of the nearly decade-long Iran-Iraq War of the 1980's. A woman and her eight-year-old daughter are all alone in the building, and are under the constant threat of bombing from Iraqi soldiers under the maniacal regime of Saddam Hussein. However, another threat looms within these walls which they are forced to contend with. One not as menacingly manifest as ballistic missile assaults, yet every bit as terrorizing.What is this malevolent yet largely unseen entity that is making the girl mysteriously sick and is driving her mom to the brink of insanity? I came up with a host of theories based upon what we know of this era and these characters, and they were continuously materializing and morphing as this ominous story progressed. I won't share them here out of respect for ""non-spoiling"" it for anyone. I'm sure you will come up with your own conjecturing should you choose to go ""Under the Shadow"".But be forewarned...it is NOT a comfy place to be."
" Horrendous

This little disaster starts boring and continues boring. It is amazing that IMDb has so many politically motivated users. No aficionado of the horror genre would EVER enjoy this movie, period. More like a story of how rotten the climate of the Middle East is and how they pretty much have war, anger and twisted ideology in their DNA. Horror movie, not even close, drama of a hell hole in the Middle East, check."
" Don't Believe these Glowing Reviews!
",0.0,-0.9888,2017-03-11 00:00:00,1,"I don't know where to begin. This is probably my first Iranian film, and reading all these really rave reviews made me believe I'm on to a good experience. Far from it, this was by far the worst movie I've watched in the last 6 months. I feel a certain perverse pleasure now that I watched this awful movie that, there are other countries out there that produce equally horrid content outside of India.As of now, there are 9,057 users that have rated this movie for an average of 7. SEVEN? Are you kidding me? I can only assume this movie has been rated by Iranians en masse to push it to such an exalted level.The first ingredient in any great, or even decent, horror movie, is its story. Okay, this movie has a semblance of a story, what with a mother grieving over the loss of her mother recently, and being unable to fulfil her desire of higher studies due to Iran's oppressive political and cultural climate.The second ingredient is characters you can relate to. This movie scores miserably on that front. I found the mother kinda revolting. She's got some personal issues, but that gives her no excuse for being rude and a general douche.The third is the scares. There were 2, maybe 3, scenes that are spooky. That's it. There's no consistent build up of tension, and the 'ghost' that does come out is laughable. An oversize polka- dotted blanket? Really? So the missile that landed brought with it a djinn? What a ridiculous idea. This doesn't scare anyone, just makes it uncontrollably funny. And that was that ending all about? What is the director trying to convey? Evil lives on, don't be the last person to move out of your apartment, or generally don't be a stupid and rude person? I don't know, nor does the director.Just an awful waste of time. Don't fall for these ridiculous reviews. Watch something nice, or just sleep."
" Classical İranian

But that is the only material that they use. it is like if they use this, they can get some awards and movie can be watch international. İt is natural of course, it is business and reputation. People will get mad at me, I know... especially women but I get sick of that İranian revelation - feminist movies. I know the story, I know what is going to happen, there is no surprise at all and always same thing over, over and over again. Scary part was scary for a Muslim because it is about jinn. But story and fiction was very weak."
" Really good, especially if you are a Muslim
",0.4927,-0.9486,2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"As I am writing this review, few minutes have passed since I have watched Under the Shadow. I will not exaggerate like some other people do in praising this movie by calling it a masterpiece. It is not! If this is a masterpiece to you, you're setting the bar very low. But I have to admit that for a horror film, this thing is damn good and refreshing. Everything about this film works very well: the development of the story, the taut direction and especially the pacing. The movie is 1h24min which is the ideal run time since no time is wasted on unnecessary scenes or plot-lines. The thing I liked most beside the direction was the story, especially the involvement of Djinn. Since I am of the Muslim confession, it made me glad that somebody finally explored this theme in a movie. Basically Djinn are nothing else than demons and seen though I have seen a lot of demon-themed horror flicks, Under the Shadow gave me genuine sense of terror which is partly due to my small familiarity with the Djinn-theme. If you are a Muslim or you know a thing or two about the mythology of Djinn and how it affects the minds of lots of Muslims, you will understand how it managed to scare me. And before I forget to mention it, the subtext in this movie regarding the political and social situation in Iran is very well delivered. A lot of the difficulties that the main character faces are present to this day and it was really refreshing to see a movie that tackles such delicate themes without bashing your head in with political statements.If you are a fan of the conventional Hollywood horror film chances are you won't enjoy it much. But if you like seeing foreign films that swerve from conventions you will probably like it."
" Compelling critique of oppressive Iranian regime subsumed by typical Hollywood-like horror machinations
",-0.6705,-0.9966,2017-02-19 00:00:00,5,"An international co-production between Qatar, Jordan, and the United Kingdom, Under the Shadow is the first Iranian ""horror"" movie I can remember. The film is the first feature from Iranian-born Babak Anvari. The strength of the film is its setting: the action takes place in Tehran in 1988, the last year of the Iran-Iraq war.The most interesting aspects of the film have nothing to do with its horror components but rather the ""horrifying"" nature of the post-Revolutionary regime that oppresses the very people whom it professes to righteously serve. Director Anvari's portrait of his protagonist, Shideh (Narges Rashidi), the Mom who's left home alone with young daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi) after her physician-husband is called to the front, is an explicit example of Iranian regime's oppressive nature. Shideh learns right away that she's been barred from resuming her medical school studies due to earlier participation in some rather benign left-wing protests against the government.While most of the action of the story that takes place in Shideh's apartment is perfunctory, whenever we're reminded of what's going on in the ""real world"" outside, that's a subject that proves abidingly of great interest. This includes Dorsa's cousin, a young boy, who is mute after experiencing the devastating deaths of his parents as a result of Iraqi missiles. Soon afterward, one of those missiles strikes Shideh's building, causing a crack in her ceiling. The missile remains unexploded and must be defused and carted away before it can wreak havoc on the remaining occupants in the building.In perhaps the most telling scene outside the apartment, Shideh flees after experiencing disturbing visions including a half-naked elderly man and floating chador, and is arrested by the morality police for failing to keep her head covered with a traditional scarf. She's let go with a warning and I only wish there were more scenes like this, highlighting the nature and quality of a regime that treats its citizens in such an unjust manner.Alas, the bulk of Under the Shadow attempts instead to imitate the typical Hollywood horror film. Instead of gremlins, we're asked to believe in the Iranian version of a tall-tale—the Djinn (evil spirits mentioned in the Koran that typically first take possession of a physical object of its victim before gaining possession of the entire soul). Shideh, with her medical/scientific background, first rejects the notion of evil spirits but later becomes a ""true believer,"" after the Djinn grab Dorsa's doll Kimia and try to permanently snatch the little girl from her beleaguered parent.No need to recapitulate any more of the vagaries of the plot, but suffice it to say that both Shideh and Dorsa take turns in rescuing one another from the big bad evil spirits. While they finally do escape by driving the car through the garage door, we ominously learn that the Djinn are still in possession of Kimia's severed head. More bad things appear to be on the horizon for Shideh and Dorsa!You might have guessed that I am not a big fan of horror films and this one is no exception. If only the film's scenarists had concentrated more on the verisimilitude of an oppressive theocracy which is Iran even today--in contrast to replicating commonplace Hollywood devices—Under the Shadow might have proved far more educational and compelling."
" It's bad. Don't watch it.

" both spooky and atmospheric
",0.0,0.9701,2017-02-15 00:00:00,9,"If you're looking for a gory slasher type film, then this is not for you. The tension in this film builds up slowly but it ends up being unbearably unnerving and simultaneously captivating. The acting is superb and very convincing, especially from Narges Rashidi, who plays the mother, although I have to say that the actress playing the little girl, really steals the show, with her facial expressions and mannerisms, she's just perfect in the role.The historical backdrop of post revolutionary Tehran, in the midst of the Iran Iraq war and the socio-economic, religious and feminist themes all add to the realism of the film and help contribute to a truly spooky and ultimately nerve wrecking atmosphere. This film is fascinating, thought provoking, intriguing and leaves you wanting more when it ends abruptly. Highly recommended"
" In a nutshell, The movie did not follow a certain story and just want to create scary scenes. Do not recommended to watch.
",-0.4949,-0.9804,2017-02-13 00:00:00,3,"The movie narrates the scary story that happens in the timing period of the Iran and Iraq war historically. Basically, some historical parts of this movie can be true but not all of them. The woman did not allow to continue her study in university because of her political activity during the Iran's revolution. The man forced to do his military service as a doctor in the war place and have to left his wife and daughter in Tehran. These parts can be true. But the people at that time was so united and helped each other too much that is shown completely reverse in this movie. After the man leaves, something odd happens to his family, like some woman called likes and try to make the viewer believe that the man has an affair when there was no sign an man's betrayal. Furthermore, it tries to show the woman is somehow have mental problem. Generally, the movie by using the scarf Hijab for the Ghost, Gen or spooky evil creature tries to affect the viewer about Hijab. In a nutshell, The movie did not follow a certain story and just want to create scary scenes. Do not recommended to watch."
" Spoilers follow ...
",0.0,0.9728,2017-02-10 00:00:00,8,"This is a film that definitely deserves more than one viewing. Shideh (Narges Rashidi), husband Iraj (Bobby Naderi) and daughter Dorsa (Avin Manshadi) live amid the chaos of the Iran-Iraq war. Shideh's studies and livelihood are in ruins, patient and tolerant Iraj has been posted away and Dorsa is behaving very oddly. My only problem with this story, as in a lot of similar situations, is that Shideh resolutely refuses to move from the family home, despite her less Westernised neighbours fleeing and advising her to do the same, and every waking hour living in fear of the latest shelling.'Under the Shadow' reminds me of Japanese horror, particularly 'Dark Water (2002)', with an errant child, and an aberration on the ceiling that may or may not be malevolent. It has been compared to 'The Babadook (2014)' (which I found wholly inferior to this). That said, this is hugely original in its presentation of a mysterious, ghostly horror. First whispered about by other children in the apartments, and then corroborated by the other fleeing parents, the audience is left impatiently awaiting their own first glimpse of the 'djinn'.With this level of relentless man-made and demonic aggravation, it's a big relief when Shideh decides to leave after all, but events suggest she may not be entirely free of the shadow.A lot of this film's success rests with young Manshadi as the little girl who is required to display increasingly erratic behaviour. Any awfulness Dorsa might exude is saved by Manshadi's mainly cherubic performance. Hardly ever does she merely sink into petulance or 'brattism' as a lesser performer would. Our sympathies are mostly with her, but also with her stubborn mother, who behaves in a way that doesn't always invite our consideration, but again is brilliantly played. Babak Anvari's gloomy, measured writing and his solid, sometimes spectacular direction ensure the mood is sustained wonderfully throughout. A terrific co-production between Qatar, Jordan, and the United Kingdom, this is strongly recommended."

It is good to see a paranormal thriller set amongst the environs of a country at war, and in a place where lashes can be dished out for not wearing hijab's.In the first part of the film it delivers a slice of life feel for the residents of another country with that documentary vibe, a real foreign film aspect (I'm in a western country) with regards to shot composition and editing.On here some 'horror movie' lovers are crying and frothing at the bit because this movie does not contain bucket loads of violence and gore. What these pillocks don't appreciate is that film making need not slot into histories neat and concise film categories and thus we can mix elements of any known genres to result in many shades of grey. A bit of an open mind might assist you pallbearers of the strict genre to rise above your misery.Now my objections are over, let me recommend this paranormal movie. It's well worth the ride :)"
" Very Interesting But There's Not A Lot Of Horror .
",0.7179,-0.9746,2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Legendary British film critic Mark Kermode said this was his favourite film of 2016 . His description of it as ""A British production , filmed in Jordan set in Iran during the Iran Iraq war and filmed in Farsi"" did pique my interest in that UNDER THE SHADOW is also a horror movie . Right can someone name me any other horror movies set during the Iran Iraq war of the 1980s ? Anyone ? Do you think Kermode might be getting elitist due to the unique nature of this movie ? To be blunt there's two stories trying to escape from the movie . One is the dilemma of the female protagonist Shideh living under the jackboot of Islamic theocracy brought on by the Iranian revolution of 1979 . The other story is the one of Djinns asserting their power . The problem is that the two stories have a problem gelling together seamlessly If nothing else we're treated to the best opening credits sequence of 2016 , a simple but very effective montage of war footage from the Iran Iraq war , a conflict that was mainly ignored by the Western media at the time . It's also easy to forget Iran was a victim of Iraqi aggression . Iraq started the war but because of the bellicose proclamations of the ayatollahs , usually denouncing the infidel West , it was the Iranians who were seen as the baddies of the conflict . I can't claim to know what life was like in 1980s Tehran but UNDER THE SHADOWS does give us a view what the home front might have been like for Persians and it was this aspect that had me hypnotised as I a lover of women and of freedom and of the occasional binge drinking session had to watch a fictional character in a real life setting realise that misogynistic men of God are now doing the thinking for everyone via 7th Century scripture and who are descended from the prophet Mohammed When you're confronted by such man made horrors - and let's not pretend religion and God aren't entirely man made - then mythical Djinns are pretty small fry . Perhaps conscious of this the horror element doesn't come close to making an appearance well in to the second half . It is in equal measure clichéd but well done . The usual jump scare tactic of turning the noise down then ramping it up a startle moment causing the audience to jump . You've seen it all before , just not with Persians getting bombed by Arab neighbours One can understand hardcore horror fans being bitterly disappointed by UNDER THE SHADOW but it's not really a film produced for horror fans . There is a novelty value to it due to the crossed genre themes but lovers of world cinema and those of us with an interest in modern Middle East geo-politics will find a lot to like about this unique film"

Honestly the movie was more interesting before the ""supernatural"" element kicked in - if the story wasn't based in 80 Teheran there would be nothing worth watching, the settings (times and location) of this movie are more interesting than the story it tries to tell - it's neither horror nor drama.

" Watchable Foreign Foray
",0.0,0.5851,2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"UTS is a foreign stab at an ordinary ""B"" movie genre using ordinary tricks of the trade, techniques, plot devices. The fact that it is Middle Eastern should not render it better or worse; e.g., it'd be condescending to admire Middle Easterners for making the same stuff so routinely cranked out or, on the other hand, fault them for making the same material. That being said, the Iran-Iraq War of the '80s creates a great backdrop for the story, as does Iran's religious taboos of the period. Excellent idea to have our heroine be an anti-establishment modern woman likewise adverse to belief in Dinji, Iranian banshees, ghosts, goblins, etc. Unfortunately as the bogeyman descends these plot devises vanish without meaning, impact, cohesion, etc. Would have loved more definition, background into Dinji, Possibly in the vehicle of another major character. The props used at the climatic scenes are super-cheesy, if forgivable. I am not being inconsistent in emphasizing that the foreign setting gives a tired genre freshness; i.e., thank God (Christian, Muslim, whatever) this wasn't a band of randy teenagers with a camcorder driving off to vacation in the woods. In short, the ""newness"" of setting overcomes UTS' being simply a slightly-better-than-average haunted house diversion."

And this is the first time I feel that I need to write a review, because there's no way this movie should be getting a 7.0 out of 10, specially when it's listed as a horror movie.It is actually quite a slow movie, if they just wanted to show you what was it like to live through the war, in less than ten minutes they could've given you the whole message.The acting is OK, the special effects are non existent, the script is kind of empty, I'm sorry to say this, but it was a complete waste of time."
" refreshing, atmospheric, and spooky.....you can't ask for anything more out a pg-13 horror movie
",-0.6077,-0.9635,2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Let me address that pg-13 part first. This movie succeeds DESPITE it's pg-13 rating, so if you are avoiding it because of that, don't, you should be pleasantly surprised. Most of the time, pg-13 means you are getting a watered down, over edited movie, made for teens. This, however, is nothing like that. This movie is surprisingly scary, in the same type of way that the Ring American remake was. It is very obvious that the director put their everything into this movie, and it shows throughout every scene. Like some of the legendary horror movie makers, this movie chooses to inject social commentary into the movie, but does so with subtlety and class, like how George Romero did with Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, where you can enjoy the film without feeling patronized in any way. The story itself is really driven by the two female leads, and frankly the little girl was outstanding. Adding in the threat of annihilation from war, on top of a possible supernatural element, adds the necessary dread for horror. You put that with the natural of feeling animosity between daughter and mother, as they suspect each other of playing head games, and you are set up perfectly to deliver the drama aspect. The cinematography was beautiful, yet fittingly bleak. And the scares are never telegraphed. This director does an excellent job of drawing you into the story, and the relationships, almost making you forget about the horror aspect, and pulls the rug out from under you. I have to say, all in all, this was not the scariest movie I have ever seen, but it was as the summary says refreshing, atmospheric, and spooky."
" It's much more than a horror film
",-0.6096,-0.9921,2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"This is a film about war and its atrocities. The primary goal of the film is obviously not to be a horror film.During the Iran-Iraq war and especially after Saddam's missiles landed in many parts of Iran, many were affected psychologically. Children who started screaming, adults with PTSD, depression and many many more psychological problems. Imagine fearing any moment that a bomb or a missile could land in your home. It's a hundred times scarier than any supernatural phenomena.The background of the film is Tehran, Iran in the 80s during the war. The supernatural elements (whether imagined by the main character or supposed to be real) beautifully symbolize the ugliness and squalor of war.If you are looking to be entertained by a purely horror film, this may not be the best choice, as there is more to it. You may be disappointed as you may tune out of anything non-horror and the rest of the film will seem tedious to watch. However, if you do not expect to be scared the entire time, and just watch it as a film about a family during the war, I guarantee that you will smile, cry and be crept out of your wits a few times. Even though I was paying more attention to the story line rather than waiting to be scared, I had a hard time walking upstairs alone to my bedroom after watching this. I am a horror film fan and I am not easily scared anymore, but I had not been so terrified in years.I give it a nine because the resolution at the end is not complete. I usually like closure at the end of the film, but again, that could mean that until the war is over, evil has not gone away."

" Intelligent, above average horror film.
",-0.1779,-0.5167,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"While it traffics in cliche's at times, echoing films like 'Repulsion', 'The Shining', 'The Devil's Backbone', 'The Exorcist' and 'Don't Look Now' -- to name only some -- 'Under the Shadow' is given freshness and depth of interest being set in Arabic/Muslim culture (Iran) and thematic depth and power by being set near the end of the terrible 8 year long Iran/Iraq war, with all its human and political horrors. Those human terrors make the horrors of the spirits only part of what is so nightmarish in the film's world. (And if you noticed, all the films I mentioned it echoing are terrific, intelligent films that also transcend 'horror' to traffic in larger themes). The story is timeless – a child being haunted, her soul being captured through a loved doll. But the specifics are striking, the performances understated and effective, the style original and intense. And the metaphors plentiful and intelligent. Trapped in a haunted apartment house by the escalating war, lead character Shideh is also trapped as a woman by a society that insists she hide herself and her body, her past liberal activism used by the patriarchal right-wing power structure that insures she will never achieve her dream of being a doctor. This has left Shideh bitter, and ironically somewhat cut off from even the positive sides of the very role of wife and mother that society demands she play. These kinds of emotional complexities aren't what one expects from a 'horror' film, but they're a welcome reminder that it can be a powerful genre to explore human behavior. I do wish it had been as creative on the horror level as on the character and thematic ones. Far too often I saw the scares coming, and found them not all that surprising. But overall that didn't bother me too much -- this was a breath of fresh air in all the details, even if the broad stokes were as old as ghost stories themselves."
