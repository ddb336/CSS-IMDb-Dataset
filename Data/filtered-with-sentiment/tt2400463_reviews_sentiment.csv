" A pretty decent flick
",0.4939,0.128,2021-04-04 00:00:00,9,"I give this film 'weighted' high marks. Im an avid horror fan and could predict where this movie was headed from the moment it started. But I enjoyed the premise, a somewhat unique take on grief and psychotherapy, the mix of great exposition and memory scenes, and that the movie held out on the pay off as long as was possible, it could have straight up ended like a drama or a horror right up to that point. To people complaining about the lack of cell phone coverage: you do know that signal jammers exist right?"
" A Solid, Self-Contained Thriller
",0.25,0.9964,2021-03-31 00:00:00,6,"The Invitation is directed by Karyn Kusama and is written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. The film stars Logan Marshall-Green, Michael Huisman and Tammy Blanchard, among others. The Invitation tells the story of a couple attending a dinner party of the boyfriend's ex, however, things are not as they seem and old drama creates new turmoil. Released throughout 2015, The Invitation did not get a mainstream limited release until 2016 where it was met with fairly positive reception from audiences and critics alike.I knew nothing about The Invitation going into it, so with my expectations relatively low, I was pleasantly surprised by the end result. The Invitation is a slow-burn thriller that knows how to build suspense and question the protagonist's intuition. The entire film, apart from the opening five minutes, is spent at one location with much of the film almost feeling like a theatre play and that's not a bad thing as I have enjoyed films that are relatively contained. The Invitation is a very character-driven film and the filmmakers did a good job at casting Logan Marshall-Green as Will. Although Will isn't exactly the most exciting character, it's clear that he's gone through some sort of trauma which builds intrigue with the viewer, on top of being a good straight man as given the circumstances in the movie Will represents the thoughts of the audience and rarely makes a dumb a decision.The Invitation is a well-written story, even despite its predictable moments and kind of knowing where the climax was going to lead to, I was still entertained by the film however it is not without its faults. The execution at times almost felt amateurish, particularly during flashback scenes or when Will was in his head about certain things; I felt that those moments were not edited the best and almost felt heavy-handed with its themes. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it certainly distracted me at times while watching the movie.In summation, The Invitation is a decent enough thriller that is certain to entertain those who check it out. While the story is well written, it's not going to be something that will blow anyone away with many moments that will feel a tad predictable; the end concept and how the movie gets to that point will surely be enjoyable. Clocking in at an hour and forty minutes, The Invitation is a rather slow film that takes time setting itself up and while the run time might be felt in certain spots there is always something going on that will intrigue the viewer. While I did enjoy The Invitation, for the most part, I also recognize it wasn't something that I truly loved, despite that, I can still recommend this film to most people. If the idea of a thriller that takes it times to set up and has moments that will make you question the reasoning of the protagonist as well as yourself, sounds good to you then definitely check this film out. For everything that The Invitation did well, there were also aspects that held this film back from being something truly great and for that reason, I am giving The Invitation a 6/10."

Eden wastes no time telling Will that she is finally at peace because she knows her ""pain will be over soon,"" a very common euphemism for death. It quickly becomes frustrating how no one other than Will understands that the cult glorifies and encourages suicide as a way to end one's suffering.That being said, I was very impressed with the way the cinematography was utilized to show a PTSD/dissociative response through the eyes of Will. The use of blurring effects, muted sounds, distortion of reality, and intermittent flashbacks during everyday tasks was effective in storytelling as much as it was accurate to how one would experience such trauma responses."

I was gripped from the start and captivated throughout, intrigued and somewhat mesmerised as I struggled, like the main protagonist, to ascertain whether things really were as potentially terrible as it seemed they might be. And just when it would appear that he and I might be overreacting..... This is a most assured achievement with writers and director locked together and a tight cast in one house on a small budget, completely focused on what is going on and at the same time making sure the viewer is made to constantly adjust and readjust their sense of reality. I thought of the horrors of Charles Manson and oddly Who'se Afraid of Virginia Woolf as I gradually began to grasp the full horror being played out here. A masterful and essential watch."

Although I am very irritated with him for making me watch this, I'm equally irritated with all the reviews saying this is a 10 star film. Let's get real, it was a 1hr40 of a repetitive mess. It was extremely predictable and just over the top when it didn't need to be. It's just a massive build up for an average ending. If you want to save some time, just start this film in the last 30 minutes. That's why I was generous enough to give 3 stars as opposed to the 1 or 2 i would have given for the full hour before that mark. Apparently there were actors like Luke Wilson and Topher Grace that were linked to roles in this film. The fact that none of them went through with it should tell you how much of a disaster this was."

",-0.1779,0.9917,2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"Good movie overall.
You can sense the awkwardness of the movie from the first scenes. This tends to be the norm as you move forward.
What once was a happy group of friends is torn apart by the tragedy that happened.
It expresses the dullability of those struck by intense and never ending pain (as losing a child affects a parent), and the distances one goes to try to erase that pain. But it never does.
For me, it was pretty predictable, because i have seen many movies/documentaries about cults and how can they mess with someones mind, eager to do anything it takes to give up that pain, instead of giving in.
On the other hand, as i have seen in other comments, its a situation exposed to such a degree, that you can imagine yourself being in that situation, maybe not as the protagonists, but as a random friend that happens to be there.
The odd characters (you will know who they are), are incredibly suspicious from the moment they appear which further makes the movie a tad predictable from my side. But that shouldnt be the case if you turn your brain off a bit. Thing is, movie is so intense you cant. Our brains are wired in such way we need to find the answers before given to us.
Nonetheless, the acting is sick ! From everyone. The plot gives in slowly to the viewer, painting a distorted picture for us to try and discover more in depth, great producing there. They did not give up more details than needed and the permanent idea of Will being mentally ill kind of overloads the scenes. Everything is pieced together so well, so realistic, its really breathtaking and lingers on you after the movie has ended.
This movie should be seen by many. We live in a world where pain occupies most of our lifes, and after watching the movie you would think that things like this might actually happen in real life.For sure a very good movie, well executed and very good acting."
" A good kind of twisted
",0.4404,-0.7053,2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,What I really like the slow burn tension of this movie. From the minute they get to the party there is not much action but the tension and discomfort are palpable. I will leave it at that
" Life and death are phenomenon well when left uninterrupted
",-0.4215,0.9011,2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,"What worked:
I think the concept of the movie is cool and impressive. It's a well built psychological thriller with good essence put on main leads, bereaving the losses in their lives. The movie attempts to balance the movie between the real psychological trauma vs the perceived threat in the unconventional and doubtful social gathering. The movie gives hints of what's about to come but also plays it cool to keep the mood of the movie normally. Overall, it's an interesting watch and an engaging one.What did not work:
The mood of the movie is set different from what the final end product of the movie Intends to provide as a result fails to thrill majority of the movie and only revealing the actual thrills too late. I think it's a well intended project failing because the makers failed to set the tone of the movie. However, the movie works if there is no expectations regarding the thrills because it is a well versed drama with a one location setting.
Final verdict: recommended"
" Masterpiece of suspense

" This is a real life horror movie. Very disturbing
",-0.807,0.988,2021-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I'll start this off my saying I am not a fan of horror movies. I've seen a few but can't put myself through them. I had no idea what this film was going to be about, I went in blind. I was on edge the entire time.Watching this movie alone at midnight was a mistake, something I would not recommend. I dread to think what my heart rate was at certain moments. There is a suspense there throughout the entire runtime and you know that something just isn't quite right.To me this is a horror movie. But a real horror movie. Not a jump scare filled, gore fest with killer clowns. But the type of horror movie that keeps you on edge the entire time, in a similar way to Get Out. You are disturbed by some of the characters because they are completely real people. This is something that you can genuinely imagine happening and for me that is why it is so terrifying.The music is played at the right moments and only makes those scenes even more tense, as does the silence is other scenes. Once I'd managed to under Tom Hardy, I thought that Logan Marshall-Green was brilliant. Other characters were pretty much generic movie characters bar a few.I think it's safe to say I was definitely shook up by this film, partly down to the fact I don't handle films with this level of tension too way but mostly due to how well the tension was done. And it didn't lose any of until the credits. For me the final shot is just horrifying.A very well done film, kept me firmly invested the whole time and left me rather disturbed afterwards. For something which isn't my cup of tea at all, I actually enjoyed it in a very strange way. I would definitely put this under horror, just not the stereotypical horror movies you imagine."

If you need constant cheap thrills throughout a movie to be entertained, watch Die Hard. If you are a fan of smart thrillers, do yourself a favor and watch The Invitation. I'm a HUGE thriller buff, and this one is easily in my top 10. The Invitation takes its time in building up the delicious tension, and there is an impending sense of something very sinister approaching, even as the other guests repeatedly write off the tormented Will as just being paranoid. When the climax arrives, it unfolds rapidly. The final scene is so spooky and brilliant. Terrific acting by the entire cast. We've seen this movie probably half a dozen times now, and it's as intriguing as ever. Settle in and enjoy this masterpiece of a thriller!"

I've kept that short as we've seen our evening squandered on this film and don't wish that fate on orhers.If you've ever seen a horror film before, you'll be heavily disappointed, and will likely leave feeling irritated and surprised at the lack of imagination. Within the first 10 minutes, you'll feel like you can guess the whole plot. Don't make the same mistake that we did: assuming that there must be a twist worthy of the film's popularity, and relatively (to the horror genre at least) high user reviews. If you think you can guess the plot, you can. There is no suspense, character development, or engagement with the story. Some may enjoy this, but my advice would be not to risk it."

Question the logic, you'll lose your interest kind of film. I had skipped a lot to reach the obvious climax. It wasn't surprising. Just disappointed."
" Surprisingly creepy movie
",0.296,0.9954,2021-01-08 00:00:00,7,"It seems like this film gets billed as a horror movie, but it really isn't. It's certainly a SUSPENSE movie though. It requires a bit of suspension of disbelief on the viewer's part (the main character tolerates a bit more than you would think he reasonably would), but it is consistently creepy. It's the kind of film that balances you very nicely between not knowing what is going on, and thinking you have a good idea of what's going on. You're given enough info and hints to keep you interested, but you don't get the full picture until nearly the end.Logan Marshall Green plays a young man still grieving over the death of his child. He and his new girlfriend receive an invitation to join his ex-wife and her new significant other, along with some other old friends, for a dinner party at his old house. It's a house that's filled with painful memories; he's clearly torn between attending this party and staying the heck away from his old place. But he still has feelings for his ex; they shared a terrible closeness with what happened to their child. She claims she's found a way to heal, and she wants him to share it. So he goes.It becomes pretty clear early on that his ex and her new beau have been to a ""retreat"" to work on healing, but that it was also probably one that was a little bit more ""out there"" than doing some yoga and sharing feelings in a circle. Green and his friends have various reactions to what they hear, from laughter to anger to incredulity. Yet no one leaves...this is the slightly unbelievable part of the film. SOMEONE would find an excuse to leave. But we need everyone there for the story...so, disbelief suspended. The creepy tone of the film more than earns our temporary forgiveness.Enter the brilliantly creepy John Carroll Lynch (a terrific character actor) and things go from mildly off-kilter to full-on ""something is really wrong here."" I won't say any more, but suffice it to say that even if you think you have figured out where the film is going, you won't see everything that happens coming. Events quickly spiral and the film goes from a slow burn to full-tilt craziness.I really liked the film because director Karyn Kusama wasn't afraid to let it build slowly. The effect is to slowly put the viewer on edge, just like our protagonist. We feel, as he does, that things aren't right. But we also see how perhaps he's just being a little paranoid. Surely his worst fears can't be true; is his own imagination getting the best of him?Green gives a very nice, lived-in performance and Lynch hits a home run. The other performers are less successful, with a couple of downright clunky performances. This is how the movie shows its low budget. A couple of solid performers were acquired and the rest was filled in with actors happy for a role to boost their imdb profiles. This, despite the moments where disbelief must be suspended, is really what keeps this movie from being 5-star. But it is nonetheless very well worth watching. It's mastery of tone and the twists the plot takes are well worth jumping into."

Basically, the guy who looks like atom Harding shows up to a party with a bunch of his old friends and a few of the friends have joined a suicide cult and are not trying to recruit and/or murder the rest of their friends (this also makes no sense, as why would you want to commit murder, rather than just ending your own life?)
There is a fair amount of tension and paranoia in the film, which I'm sure was intentional in order to give the plot substance. However I felt like the director over relied on this and paid far too little attention to the actual story.
In the end, I'm left wondering if the writer's actual intent was to make me want to kill myself with boredom and cliche?"

If you want to see a film for action or horror this is not for you. Very little happens in the first hour as it all about making you think what is happening something isn't right here. But that's the point you need to keep watching to find out how it ends. The acting is pretty good as well, I felt the grief for the main characters as I'm sure anyone who has children would. The ending has a nice twist right before the closing credits as well that I didn't see coming. To sum up you will either love this film or you will find it boring.

",0.2263,0.3927,2020-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Initially, this film reminded me of a modern version of 1932's 'The Old Dark House', in which a group of strangers meet up and navigate their way through an awkward evening, where every word and sentiment is laced with some cryptic double-meaning, before events take on a more horrific note.Here, we meet Will (Logan Marshall-Green), someone so determinedly uncomfortable, it seems there aren't enough egg-shells in the room to walk on around him. When we (and his outstandingly loyal girlfriend Kira, played by Emayatzy Corinealdi ) meet his group of friends (and his ex-wife Eden, played by Tammy Blanchard) who have organized the reunion in which the story takes place, we feel he has every reason to be so tense.As is often the case, I enjoyed the 'journey' more than the 'destination'. The finale I found too vague, although the open-ended nature of events is scary. My score for this compelling and stylish production is 7 out of 10."

My expectations were sky-high after reading festival reviews in 2015 and let me tell you, the feature did not disappoint.Will and his new girlfriend Kira shows up to his ex-wife Eden and her new husband David' dinner party, high up in the Hollywood hills. But a tragic past haunts what should have been a joyous evening and Eden and David's strange behavior and some mysterious house guests only adds to the ever escalating sense of tension. Is Will becoming unhinged or is something more ominous afoot.I'm not a fan of director Karyn Kusama previous efforts but d##n, she absolutely knocks it out the park with this taut pressure cooker of a film.
The less you know going in, the better, trust me.
The film is brilliantly directed as are the preformences of the actors and the tight structure of the story (the climax is just a natural conclusion, chaotic as it may be)
Watch this film if you like psychological horror brimming with slow-burn tension revolving around social awkwardness and pleasantries masquerading menace."

Every 5 minutes I had myself guessing as to what was going to happen next and not once did I guess right. I also give praise to how the movie handles grief. As humans we never let things go, we only bury it until it inevitably resurfaces. And watching this movie is a very realistic depiction of when that pain comes back and how it can affect a person.

Any true horror fan needs to watch this film. I love the naturalistic style where the characters are sitting around having the chats where it feels almost improvised but you know it isn't. There are other horror films which have incorporated this kind of style and it can work extremely well if done right. The dread and suspense builds in the film very steadily up to a very satisfying conclusion. It's the type of film where you shouldn't watch a trailer or read a review for fear of spoilers. The less you know about this film the better. All you need to know is it's a top quality horror film and easily one of the very best horror installments of the past 15 years. A solid 9/10.

Second part is a typical slasher, nothing to be said here except that it really ruined the impression made by the first part, it feels completely out of place and even from a gore horror point of view it's not a very good slasher really, 1/10. Third part is a very short but significant plot twist which, at least for me was unexpected. That part deserves 9/10. So in the end the overall rating is 18/30, or 6/10"

Then something interesting really happened at 1:20, which was the final 15-20 minutes of the film (which was anticlimactic, by the way, as the main character contributed absolutely nothing to everything that happened then.)

This film is a decent watch if you're looking for a suspenseful slow-buildup thriller.
The pros in this film include the the eerie and tense atmosphere that is apparent from the start of the film, the use of silence and seemingly random strange encounters and conversations that built up the tension throughout the film which set the tone of the film in the right direction. I enjoyed the focus on people's faces and expressions to convey the mood of the room. There wasn't a moment that I didn't want to know what would happen next or that I was bored.On the downside, some of the dialog was a little cringy, but it was easy enough to look past that. I did guess how the film was going to end pretty early on in the film, although there was one twist to it. There was a kind of predictability with the clues that they presented to the audience, so I wasn't exactly mind-blown.Despite that, it was an enjoyable experience and more or less the kind of film I was expecting it to be.

" A Unique, Slow Paced, Captivating, Well Executed(no pun intended) Piece!
",0.3382,0.9882,2020-07-02 00:00:00,8,"OK.
I was not expecting my first review to be written on such an apparently unfamiliar, quite underrated(so to speak) movie.And yet, here I am.I've heard about The Invitation from Chris Stuckman who's movie reviews I appreciate and even though his mention of this film was only brief and as an example of Logan Marshall-Green's features in his review of Logan's also wonderful acting role in the sci-fi action-thriller movie Upgrade(2018), the few words he had to say about it got me quite intrigued and so I went and added it to my watchlist.This one got me invested right from the opening scene, thanks to the great directing of Karyn Musama.We meet our lead Will(played by Logan) and his partner Kira(played by Emayatzy Corinealdi) already on their way to a get-together, essentially jumping(or should I say driving) right to it.
On their way something seemingly meaningless happens but it feels to me like it's not even though I couldn't quite put my finger on its connection to the rest of the movie.
Then we meet Will's old friends followed by his ex-wife Eden - who he separated from after losing their only son a few years back - and her present partner David - with which his ex-wife disappeared for the last two years.
From the moment we meet these two, and as the movie moves along, there's an off-putting sensation radiating from them, approved to the audience by Will's reactions as well as his partner Kira and his friends.
This delicate interaction was, for me, the visual soundtrack to this movie.
It seems Eden has somehow managed to put her loss and pain in the past, while we get more and more signs from Will - many of which are elegantly presented to us in Will's scattered moments of roaming their old house(yeah, his ex-wife stayed in the house where they lived with their son) - that he's not in the same place.
This contrast between Will's and Eden's state of mind and their individual ways of coping with their shared painful past was played in such a subtle yet strong way and I found it very well intertwined in the chain of events.
The tension, which is built from the start almost without our awareness, gradually intensifying as Will becomes more and more alienated(gently put) to Eden's and David's ""hospitality"".
This only grows with the joining of Eden's and David's two mysterious friends Sadie and Pruitt, both unknown to all other guests present.Logan Marshall-Green's performance is really good and it does the most in feeding the contrast between him and Eden as previously mentioned, and in walking the viewers through the mystery slowly unfolding before us.
The rest of the cast is also worth mentioning for their performance as they all give us different parts to support this mysterious and in many ways fragile structure of events.The soundtrack does a lot to hold the plot in a very tense, almost sealed(pun intended) mood, even though it's more of a really low undertone for the most part.With many small breadcrumbs spread throughout the movie, we arrive at the nerve-wracking climax which is topped off with ending scene, sending us away with an unhinged jaw. One thing that bothers me about the ending is WHY, but I think that's something I'll be able to answer on a second viewing.All in all, a must-watch in my opinion, especially if you can appreciate slow-paced thrillers(reminding me of gems like 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Get Out', 'Joker', 'Parasite')."

The twinkling lights of L.A. below the hills where the conflicted creative class dwells, and existential madness ensues.I loved the red colored lantern effect in the backyards.Our main protagonist has wonderful gravitas and his girlfriend is gorgeous and silent.The opening scene is not subtle, but it is effective as a taste of what is to come. Nice work.There's a goof when the couple arrives at the man's former home. The girlfriend is surprised by the wealth it reflects. He then explains that his former wife came from money.But if he is your boyfriend, you would know that already. You just drove through the Hollywood Hills to get there anyways. That's where the rich live, and you would already know that your man used to live there.The big problem was with lack of character development. This was a reunion of friends who had been present together at a child's birthday party two years ago. But how did they meet before that? What do they do for a living?One guy is a nursing assistant, but we don't hear what the rest did, except a record producer who was not part of the original group of friends. There is no chemistry with any of them.Meanwhile the premise of the ultimate goal is not very creative. The hosts came up with the concept after new age training in Mexico. But that's all there is to it?Again the setting is great, and you can do so much with a reunion piece and the right dialogue. But this one falls flat. No one raises any interesting counter arguments to the philosophy espoused.I do buy the premise that shallow people live in the Hollywood Hills. But our lead does not seem like the kind of guy who would be married to the woman who became his ex. He seems more thoughtful and insightful.The horror aspects were mild compared to what you've scene. I appreciated that, and I'm ok with the twist. It was satisfying enough for me.I don't recall any music. Which probably means that if it was effective, it did not affect me."

",-0.4019,0.672,2020-05-23 00:00:00,4,"Yes, this film is a slow burn and no, that doesn't necessarily work in the film's favour. Much of the last act of the film is entirely predictable, and there is no doubt in my mind that the final twist will leave you disappointed.**Spoilers below**It is perfectly clear that this is going to be a 'suicide cult' in the end to anyone who is paying attention to the film. Having said that, I wouldn't blame you for not paying attention for the entire 100 minutes as the first hour does precious little to capture your attention. The last half an hour ramps up the pace with almost no warning, which is bizarre given how obvious the 'clues' are throughout the rest of the film. The twist in the final moments that this is happening in almost every house in the entire neighbourhood completely obliterates any suspension of disbelief. Are we supposed to believe that every member of this cult is rich enough to buy a house in this area, and that all of these houses just happened to be for available at the same time they all returned from Mexico?"

",0.5859,0.113,2020-05-13 00:00:00,5,"Cool idea, and the payoff in the final scene somewhat validates the overall story, but the slow, cliche-riddled build up only serves to frustrate rather than create tension or intrigue: script padding to extend what could have been a great black mirror or x-files episode into a mediocre feature length movie. Can't fault the performances or cinematography but with just a few minor tweaks to the story it could have been a lot more satisfying! Unfortunately despite the positives I'm looking back at the entire first hour as an awkward, amateur-ish waste of time."

",-0.3559,0.6262,2020-05-11 00:00:00,4,"Perhaps it didn't help that I was feeling tired before I started this movie, but I kept wondering when and how it was going to kick up a notch. I'm fine with slow burns, but even when the film climaxed, I didn't feel much of a burn. I think it's because none of the characters felt like real people, nor did any of the situations feel real. As far as the dialogue was concerned, plenty of the conversations felt clunky, and not just because someone was acting eerie. One thing that comes to mind is the leading character, Will, flip-flopping constantly about whether he wanted to stay or go. I could understand him being uncertain whether to trust his perceptions, but I never felt real depth or reasoning from him - it didn't feel like a dilemma so much as the script dictating, ""This is Will's decision for now until the next thing happens."" But I did give a few stars because I liked some themes (even if they was presented loosely), and I guess because it did keep me on until the end, because I wanted to try and understand the characters' bizarre motivations. I mean, the motivations turned out to not be convincing or believable, but the movie dragged me along to learn about them anyway."

Will was well portrayed as the brooding intense protagonist, with tragedy in his past, uncomfortable but for some reason obliged, or curious enough to attend that fateful invitation.The set up regarding Will's will power and practical empathy regarding injured coyote set up neatly his strength to act when necessary, and set some tone for his character.When we learn of his tragic past we feel empathy for him, yet it also makes us question his sanity and state of mind, is he paranoia or not and his suspicions justified?A clever use of a single location, and the cinematography and lighting works well in supporting the story which has us questioning for a good part of the journey, what is going on?A well executed film, a truly riveting experience and well worth watching!"
" Read this before you watch it
",0.0,-0.9741,2020-04-25 00:00:00,5,"I normally don't write reviews on IMDB but this movie seriously gave me so much motivation to do that. And not in a good way.I've been a thriller/suspense/horror genre fan for years, I watched many movies from psychological thrillers to straight up gore movies to suspense and all that, so when I read this movie's description, I was like ""yeah, I gotta watch this definitely."" And oh boy I did.First of all I'd like to say that, the movie could have been at least 50 minutes shorter if you cut out the weirdly long pauses in conversations, in between stares and awkward silence when the main character Will walks around in the house without anyone noticing him leaving - at least 5 times by the way. It was a slow-burn I get that but there should be a limit to how much you can ""take slow"". If you erase everything I stated above, the movie would have been maybe an hour long and wouldn't bore you that much.When such a long long slow-burn happens, you anticipate a very good ending with a very good explanation behind it. Some parts you'll have to fill in for yourself of course as the audience. However, the problem here is, how stupid a group of people can be just because they're in a horror movie? There was only one who was clever enough to leave and we don't even know if she ever ""really"" made it out. I'm trying to spoiler free here but oh god how much I wanna say everything.The film was intended to give the audience some suspense and some feelings of paranoia, yet it only gave me a boring time. Why? Because, it is mostly from the point of Will-the main character so you only see his struggles, assume that he's probably gone insane but at the same time, all the hosts in the house act very weird (Eden and David). When in the first 10 mins of the movie two new characters came to the house, who weren't ""the group's"" friends at all, nobody even questioned who they were. The group was so welcoming to the two new strangers, coming to a party that was supposed to be reunion for a group of friends who hadn't seen each other in two years. Those two should've seen irrelevant and should've caused suspicion in the first place. But it didn't at all.Basically, that suspense didn't get resolved for 1 hour and 20 mins, then suddenly it all became clear at the end of the night. So if you just watched about the first 40 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the movie, you would understand it very good. But there are also too many plotholes, I'm not gonna say them here to be spoiler-free.If you choose to watch this because the cast is good or the poster looks fine (that's what I did) you have a big chance of being disappointed, at least I was."

Acting was just horrible, none of the actors had a character, a story (except the kid dying part which built up through the entire film and ended up not meaning anything at all in the end) or any sort of originality. But to be honest what could've they done with that script?
Plot was trying too hard to be deep and touching but it was just meaningless every 5 minutes there was a ""plot twist"" and I don't mean that in a positive way. Save yourself from the trouble and don't watch it!"

",0.6542,0.9702,2020-04-19 00:00:00,7,"I enoyed it first because i think the build up is good. Yes, you might argue it takes too long and that some scenes could be unnecessary. That's true, but at the same time this is almost a character-only film where Will is confronted with his ghosts of the past. This is pretty much what the movie is about: the travel of this character throughout things he put on the back of his head that he remembers now because he's back to that house. and to guess what's actually going on, being the one who's more comfortable to to point the elephant in the room - he lived there and was married with the hostess.the movie has some predictability on how it goes, but it keeps you guessing until the end, due to clues that start to be there, but then they're explained and you don't know if it's going on what you predict or not. in that sense i think the script was well made, even though it might have some flaws on how it presents some of the events. plus some characters such as will's girlfriend are unnecessary in my biew, and most of the other don't have much to talk about - it's almost everyhing towards how they relate to wil than anything else.Still you can't say the movie is bad directed, that the cinematography is bad or even that it doesn't build suspense. It does, and that makes you on keep guessing. plus the ending is good, you don't know how things will be solved. you have no idea when you see the purpose of the invitation coming into life. Maybe the build up could be a bit different, maybe the ending motives could have been changed...but i enjoyed this movie and i don't understand what's so much to complain here. it doesn't rush into things and has a solid main character with a good logan marshall green.so yeah if you like movies that build up tension slowly until the main revelations i would recommend. if you are more into thrillers that have quicker reveals i wouldn't. but patience in important in movies too."

Like the plot is very very unoriginal. Veeeeeery.I mean the movie is fine it's a good time killer it's above average i liked some of the acting (Eden not so much) but i'm dropping 5 points for the obvious plot that everybody with half a brain will figure out in the first 20-25 minutes."

",0.25,0.5499,2020-04-14 00:00:00,6,"It is clear what the directors vision was for this film and it succeeds in places but unfortunately falls short in many others. The issue it faces is that it doesn't really build on the ideas it establishes throughout. The majority of the film chooses to focus on the protagonist's inner demons and fails to build suspense and tension for the bigger picture. You could realistically cut out a 30 minute section in the middle of the film and it wouldn't affect the plot or overall impact.If you like your 'cult' movies there is still plenty to enjoy here - but as one of its major plot devices is taken straight from one of the most infamous cults in American history, it is hard for it not to feel like a rehash"

" Psycho/Slasher Thriller with a sick twist
",-0.4404,-0.9666,2020-02-26 00:00:00,10,"The Invitation defies expectations for a movie that takes the audience slowly up a very steep hill to then drop rapidly back down, and I believe has every implication of Vera Dika's breakdown of slasher films. The movie takes place in the confines of a house in the Hollywood Hills, a house in which Will, the main character, and his ex-wife Eden experienced a past traumatic event, losing their son at their house party. The commemoration of that event is the invitation all the friends receive years later inviting them to a dinner at the same house. I believe the repressed people are Will, Eden and Eden's invitation members. They are all linked because they have all had traumatic experiences, and are trying to move on. The movie contains a lot of intertextuality, for instance, Will and Kira, Will's girlfriend, run into a coyote on the drive to the party. Instead of leaving the animal in pain and on the side of the road, Will strikes it in the head with a tire rod, killing it. This leads the audience up to the house feeling uneasy, and sets us up for a dinner party ready to turn for the worst leading to poison, guns, and blood. Will's killing of the coyote also brings intertextuality to the understanding of mercy. Mercy relates to The Invitation cult's duty to end the suffering of others. What turns this movie from good to excellent is Karyn Kusama's ending scene. The theme that life is filled with anxiety, depression and a sense of happiness as the final cut suggests that surviving one traumatic experience only leads to more of the same across the land."
" Too Slow
",0.0,-0.8519,2020-02-26 00:00:00,4,"The Invitation is a psychological thriller with a relatively predictable plot as the audience can anticipate what the outcome will be quite quickly. While it seems that there is slow-building suspense that creates an overall unsettling mood, the audience is left waiting for when exactly things will turn for the worst at the dinner party. This makes The Invitation appear boring and unnecessarily drawn out. Most of the action takes place in the last half an hour of the movie. As a result, it would be more appropriate for this movie to be labeled as a thriller rather than as a horror movie. At the same time, there is no real dramatic twist as the ending occurs as expected. Low lighting adds to the mysterious nature of the seemingly innocent evening. Logan Marshall-Green's character, Will, is full of suspicion and makes numerous observations that add to the tension. With Will being in the house where his young son died and facing his ex-wife and her new husband, the audience questions his behavior as he appears to just be paranoid and traumatized. Questions about his past and the relationships between the guests are answered in a series of flashbacks and through conversations in the house. The red flags that Will repeatedly raises to the other guests are dismissed, but what happens when you are ""too polite,"" as Will claims?"
" Could have been better
",0.4404,-0.9639,2020-02-26 00:00:00,3,"The Invitation cleverly toys with the question of if a person completely let go, move on, and remain unaffected by past trauma. While the concept of an awkward dinner party is unique and attention-grabbing, the execution leaves the audience disappointed. Instead of a steady and productive building of the suspense, there is a sense of the movie simply just dragging. Most of the movie is shot in one location and focuses on polite conversation. To be blunt, it's slow, unlike most horror movies which typically cause you to be at the edge of your seat for a majority of the time. The Invitation does not succeed in making you feel fear. While Karyn Kusama managed to fill the screen with a heavy tone and forced positivity, there is a creepy mood that is established rather than a scary one. As a result, I firmly believe that this movie does not fall into the category of horror. The most development occurs in the last part of the movie when the real action happens. One of the main characters, Will, seems to be a mess of emotions. He acts suspicious, upset, confused, angry, paranoid, and unable to cope with*START SPOILER*facing his apparently now perfectly happy and peaceful ex-wife a few years after the death of his young son.*END SPOILER*The audience is set up to think that Will is sabotaging what appears to be an innocent and peaceful dinner party. At first, the audience sympathizes with Will as they see flashbacks of a traumatic event that he experienced. After some time, however, he is portrayed as a mood dampener and the audience finds it hard to make excuses for him. In reality, he turns out to be the sharpest of the group."
" The Invitation to Dissatisfaction and Disappointment.
",-0.7579,-0.4099,2020-02-26 00:00:00,4,"The suspenseful horror film The invitation (2015), directed by Karyn Kusama, was an almost flawlessly handled movie. The consonance between the anxiety and paranoia of the main character are all well-rationalized to match the same anxious, thick, and paranoid feelings that you may be feeling as you progress in place of the main character. The sense only amplifies as more evidence becomes apparent, even throughout the monumental amount of opposing feelings that his counterparts may be feeling when faced in the same situation. The director caresses you into opposing the cast and siding with the logical main character. I say this because this whole timeline of the seemingly logical protagonist (opposed to the illogically calm cast) is flipped. At this point, there is a dissonance that builds between you and the main character, and when he is finally correct, at a spilling climax, his episodes of anxiety and paranoia are well rewarded. The only issue in the beautiful handling of your psyche throughout the story is that you are not there to greet him in his climax of satisfaction. You are left with the dissatisfaction of following him through the story (which was attacked time and time again), and then the dissatisfaction of not staying on his side in the final climax when he is rewarded the justification of his actions. I feel that this was a fowl move on the director's part as you are not left satisfied with any part of this movie, so if you are hoping to gain satisfaction from this movie, you will surely be left disappointed. The final climax was also much too fast, which again, builds into the dissatisfaction of the movie as you are left no point to regain that connection with the main character. However, the story-line was unique and respectable, but not one worth being satisfied with."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.8823,2020-02-24 00:00:00,4,"The invitation by Karyn Kusama felt like a very long and drawn out movie. She used a very diverse group of actors. If you take out the loud, over the top sounds and music in the first 80 minutes of the movie then it is just a group of friends hanging out with four obvious cult members. As paranoid as Will was, I am surprised he did not insist on leaving. It also makes it very obvious to the audience, considering its a horror film that something is going to happen. This is the first movie I have ever watched that builds up too much suspense with the clues left behind, music, setting, and behavior of the characters. Everyone and their dog knew that when Will pointed out the bars on the window and locked door that something was going to happen. Even though it is a horror movie and people are supposed to be oblivious to general things, this seemed like there were too many big red flags that they just brushed off, like the video of the woman dying and the pills. If you take away from the friends acting like the hosts were just a bit quirky, the movie was pretty well put together. Especially the lighting, there were dim lights all around the house in every scene apart from the kitchen table with the wine, in which the lights were bright adding some intensity and finally the climax to the movie. The ending scenes with everyone dying and fighting was also very well done, but it was not worth waiting the entire movie for it to happen. A few details did not make sense to me in the movie such as, the hosts letting Will see his dead son's room with the computer in it, he obviously was going to look through it after playing detective the entire movie. Also, everyone in the neighborhood takes part in the killing of their friends, but if Will had never moved out he would not have taken part in it, so how did they convince an entire area of California to kill all their closest friends. Finally, they should had been more clear when they were killing off people about who is dead and alive, because I thought it was just the Eden, David, Will, and Kira left."
" Definitely worth a watch
",0.5574,-0.765,2020-02-24 00:00:00,9,"The invitation is a brilliant film in many ways, but also falls under some of those movie stereotypes we all know. I've seen a lot of other reviews claiming it was too slow to build up suspense or progress in the story, but I feel this is a necessary step to really connect with the film. The pace of the film allows you to witness the strange events that inevitably lead to the end of the film. For me, it felt like I was a guest at this ill-fated dinner party witnessing the events with the other characters in the movie. It allows you to guess and wonder what is going on instead of immediately throwing something obvious in your face. The pace of the film also allows you to connect with the characters and feel for what they have and currently are going through. You really start to root for the characters and worry for their outcome. Yes other horror films make you worry for the characters but you really get to know the characters in this film and connect with them as people instead of just characters in a horror movie. This connection definitely increases your anxiety when things turn south in the film. The sound in this film was really interesting to me. If you have seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then you understand how that movie uses very loud noises to create an uncomfortable feeling in its viewers throughout the film. The Invitation implements similar tactics by using sudden loud noises to create discomfort and also connect with the past trauma of one of the main characters. The lighting in this film also added a lot of mystery and tension with its use of shadows and softer lights. Finally, what really scared me about this movie is how the enemy is a very real thing that exists everywhere and can affect anyone. This information definitely scares me more than most films I watch. I would definitely recommend seeing this film."
" Skip dinner with your ex next time
",0.0,0.7707,2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Karyn Kusama's 2015 film The Invitation is not only a riveting take on grief and what we do with our feelings of grief. The film masterfully uses its initial first act to build tension slowly, inching the viewer closer and closer to the edge; until the film tosses you off a cliff into a disturbing fever dream of paranoia and dread. Kusama's intent to push the horror-thriller genre out of its complacency with PG-13, jump scare fueled, stalker money grabs pays off exceptionally well as she manages to create not only one of the best horror films of the 2010's, but thrillers as well.In the same vein as 2017's Get Out, the film is centered around an innocent enough event - a dinner party. The dialogue in this film is outstandingly presented in an authentic manner, making the entire situation all the more believable. The film also offers a fantastic look at our attitudes towards old relationships and the lengths some people may go to in order to save face. Logan Marshall-Green (Will) gives a fantastic performance, and is able to convey the sheer self doubt and uneasiness the audience is also having while viewing the film.All in all, The Invitation is not only a thought provoking film on the challenges humans may have coping with grief, but also the conviction we have to remain uncontroversial and not say anything until it's too late. However, the biggest lesson to take away from all of this might just be to never have dinner with your ex again."
" The Invitation VS Horror
",-0.5719,-0.9951,2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Spoiler Alert BelowThe Invitation is a type of movie that no one would expect to be in the Horror genre, but there is a reason why it is considered a Horror film. This movie is not about the jump scares and the creepy monsters out of our imaginations. The Invitation really uses a slow build up to have such an impact at the late scenes of the movie. It is real to the point that it is possible in real life. We hear about murders and brainwashing but we never realize it is happening right outside of our doorsteps. The way The Invitation is set up brings a feeling of suspense and caution by incorporating a sad backstory to the main character and a drifting between two souls who went trough a trauma and dealt with it in different ways. The deep connection we encounter with the main character gives us a sense of what he went through with the loss of his son. The movie incorporates a lowkey lighting to contribute of the feeling that something is off and something horrifying is going to occur while we are presented with a perfectly normal setting. From the beginning we notice Will have this uneasy feeling and being all skeptical while everyone else is relaxed and enjoying the night. We start questioning what is going on because it throws you off. This movie strays from the four main components of modern horror. It does this by straying from the questioning of rationality, there is no inhuman aspect of any part of the film. There are not supernatural or unkillable monster. This breaks the 3rd main component of the modern horror. We do not get any violation of boundaries and if we do, they are bare minimum which is another aspect that this film is missing from the four main components of modern horror. Overall this movie is a different type of horror and it gives the feeling we all search for when we watch horror in a different unique way."
" A Dinner Party from Hell
",-0.4404,-0.9766,2020-02-24 00:00:00,5,"(Spoilers)The Invitation (2015) directed by Karyn Kusama is all centered around a dinner party that is anything but traditional. This psychological thriller starts off with a slow pace that never really picks up. If you know anything about history, cults or perhaps even conspiracy theories then you'll most likely figure the ending to this film out. Kusama just missed the mark on this thriller. The film spends a substancial amount of time focusing on little hints that those who are throwing the dinner party are not well in the head. I found myself wanting to be scared, becuase Kusama does do a good job of building up tension. Yet, too many times in this film the movie just flops. The film focuses strongly on the paranoia of the characters without putting a paranoid or thrilling feeling into the audience. The film moves at such a slow pace that it kills any tension or anxiety that was built up. The characters have very dull and yet very different personalities. These personalities seems like they are almost too different for the characters to even have a relationship with each other. Creating no real connection between the viewer and the characters. This film mainly takes place in the same house, which is not necessarily bad, if anything this should help Kusama with making her audience feel trapped. Still, I feel the mark was missed due to the ""homey"" feel and the lighting. Overall the film seemed too predictable. The slow pace killed tension while the characters made this film feel tedious to watch. This film seemed like it was meant to be a psychological thriller more then a horror film. Still, I'd argue the film is also barely a psychological thriller because of how easy it is to know who the antagonist(s) are. This dinner party from Hell was as scary as expecting a good meal and getting McDonalds instead. Could have been a great concept but was executed cheaply and very dull."
" The Invitation, a slow burner.
",0.0,-0.8044,2020-02-24 00:00:00,3,"Karyn Kasuma's 2015 film, The Invitation, is a slow burner to get to the all too predictable ending. I would not recommend this film if you are more of a fast and furious kind of person. I would not consider this film to be horror nor a thriller either. I'm not much of a horror or thriller person but in this film there is nothing that is quite horrific or thrilling about it.The dull characters and bad acting leads to an all but less than mediocre ending. The interactions between supposed friends does not seem realistic.The constant wait for something to happen creates boredom. As the storyline continues it becomes more and more predictable to know what will happen next.The locking of the front door in the beginning to the idea of a cult and the drinking of wine immediately gave away the ending for me. Don't get me wrong there is a constant build up with the silent suspense and the suspenseful soundtrack that attempts to create a re-engagement in the film. Leading the audience to hope for something to happen, except we get nothing. Other than for the first and last fifteen minutes that contains most of the story line and drama, the film has a great amount of flashbacks that could have been done better to fit the plot of the film. The few jump scare attempts are not as effective or memorable either as the plot of the film slows down and stays that way until the end. Overall, the film did not stand up to par to its category of being a horror and drama film. It relies too much on the tension build up to keep the audience engaged, but in reality it does not. There is drama between the characters, but not enough to create horror. The Invitation, is only sub par to what it was expected to be."
" Reunion Dinner Oddities
",0.0,-0.9774,2020-02-24 00:00:00,6,"A SPOILER ALERT""Horror films don't have to have someone die within the first hour of the film to be considered a horror film"" is what I told myself as I was patiently waiting for a climactic scene to peek its way onto the screen. They actually don't have to have a death at all since one of the most renown horror films of all time, Poltergeist, has no deaths. Try to argue that it's not horror and you will be met with waves of fury from the horror film community.With The Invitation, the basic plotline of friends coming together in reunion or celebration is nothing new. Look at The Cabin in the Woods, college students get together for a cabin vacation and end up being slaughtered one by one. The other common theme is that they both have groups of people that believe the deaths of others will be serving a greater purpose than if they were to stay alive. ""Brainwashing"" could be a term used to describe the reasonings behind David, Eden, Sadie, and Pruitt's downfalls. The trust that those four had in the teachings of Dr. Joseph was something that they were willing to die for. When a person is willing to die for their beliefs, then there is nothing but death that can stop them.Notably as well, is the domino effect that springs up in the last minute of the film. Domino effects are usually used in a negative connotation rather than a positive one. You hear it being used as a warning most of the time to watch what you say or do. No real surprise to see the concept used in a horror film since it gives the feeling of intimacy to the viewer that the virus is spreading like wildfire and it's only a matter of time until they're next in line."
" Tension and Paranoia Done Right
",-0.5106,0.9955,2020-02-24 00:00:00,7,"The Invitation (2015) is a movie that brilliantly constructs a story that continually makes the viewer question, what is safe? Kusama crafts a movie that never lets the viewer know what to trust, as all of the characters on the screen have features that leave a muck taste in your mouth.Tension is established throughout the movie by shadowy lighting and healthy use of the close-up, which drags the viewer into uncomfortable situations over and over again.The Invitation is a mystery, but not one that unravels cleanly and neatly like opening a gift on a wedding anniversary. The mystery has a great sense of realness to it. It is wrought with paranoia and doubt which makes it an interesting enigma.Overall, The Invitation is a solid movie. It has an entertaining mystery which is heightened by sophisticated cinematography and an exceptional score. My biggest issue with the film is that it is somewhat lacking stand out quality when it comes to storytelling. The mystery, which feels real and is interesting, also feels somewhat predictable at times. I judge movies heavily on if I desire a re-watch after the first viewing, and I am not jumping out of my seat to watch it again.The Invitation is a movie that portrays the power of cinematography to play on emotions and it contains some beautiful editing and construction. The story, which was entertaining, lacked a few more layers that I would have liked to see. I do recommend that you give it a watch though, since it is a movie that deserves."
" Yet Another Dinner Party from Hell...
",0.4019,-0.9579,2020-02-23 00:00:00,8,"WARNING: SPOILERS
Welcome to yet another dinner party from hell, which could very well be the tagline for Karyn Kusama's 2015 film The Invitation. This film is the definition of a slow burn because whenever you think something violent is about to happen it pivots in a new direction. However, this doesn't mean it's void of tension as it's always there simmering beneath the surface. Every sound from the clattering of wine glasses to the constant beeping of a car engine is articulated to the point where audiences are left waiting for a release that will never come (until the last 30 minutes of the film that is).Kusama along with cinematographer Bobby Shore did a wonderful job creating an aesthetically pleasing film where meaning is infused into every image. The film predominantly takes place during present day, but it does feature systematically placed flashbacks to flesh out character backstory. The cooler tones used in flashbacks give off a nurturing and calming effect that comes with domestic bliss while the transition to warmer tones represent the underlying anger of the present that will inevitably boil to the surface. The addition of a low-key lighting scheme, which is a staple in the horror and thriller genres, bathes the whole interior in shadows to further emphasize the mysterious nature of the evening.Throughout The Invitation, there is a theme of death and how individuals deal with grief. When we are at our must vulnerable is often when vultures strike because we are more susceptible to their influence. No matter how twisted their ideology may be the ""monsters"" are victims themselves who are only doing what they've been told will free them from their pain, which in the end is a very human emotion. This is adeptly depicted by all the actors involved, but particularly by Tammy Blanchard's portrayal of Eden, a woman who is desperately trying to escape an all-consuming grief. I recommend going in knowing nothing about The Invitation in order to get the maximum effect, which is surprising coming from someone who reads film synopses because she hates surprises."
" An invitation to remember...
",0.0,-0.7041,2020-02-23 00:00:00,6,"This film is worth watching, but not for the reasons you might think. It is best to approach the film without grand expectations and with the realization that it is not your typical horror movie. It is best described as a psychological mystery/drama.
The general narrative structure is mediocre at best and highly predictable. The mystery of the invitation is revealed early on despite the attempt of hiding it with the uncomfortable atmosphere of the dinner party. Still, there are some redeeming qualities that make it worth watching at least once.
The spiritual message and social commentary weaved throughout the film are intriguing, particularly how it is portrayed through Will's ex-wife. When she is first introduced, Eden enters the room as a vision of purity in her white, flowy attire-a direct nod to The Garden of Eden. Visually, she represents perfection, much like the paradise environment that is associated with the biblical garden. Yet, if you recall the story, Eden is not perfection, but potential. Internally, she is susceptible to the ways of evil, most notably death and deception as seen in the film, and the serpent in the Bible. For Eden, and the other followers, this potential manifests itself in an idea that pain is optional and its removal can be achieved through transcendence.
The ""cult"" that has invaded several homes in the surrounding neighborhood, as demonstrated by the lantern lighting, seems like a comment on mental health. The people of the cult have been brought together by their experiences with trauma and inability to cope with it. The flashbacks that Will has provide a glimpse into Eden's mental instability over the loss of their son. While this specific traumatic incident is not experienced by everyone, the emotions that follow are a commonality throughout society. Unfortunately for Eden, and so many others, transcendence (suicide) is a way to remove the pain of severe depression.
Despite the slow moving and predictable nature of the film, the underlying message does make it worth watching. Again, don't go into it with high expectations, but watch it for the social commentary."
" Worst. Dinner party. Ever.
",-0.34,-0.8611,2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I'm never going to a dinner party in the Hollywood Hills, no matter how good looking the people are.Subdued, meticulous and distinctive in tone, The Invitation is a film whose horrors lie in human behavior rather than supernatural forces. Director Karyn Kusama taps into the primal nature of paranoia and suspicion to craft an engrossing psychological thriller that will do everything it can to spike your anxiety up into the stratosphere. The film also serves as a poignant study of loss and the lengths to which a person will go to free themselves of its pain.This film is a series of tensions and diffusions. The strength of The Invitation comes from its unpredictability. It keeps the audience second-guessing every visual cue and character action. The sense of unease stems from dissonance among the characters. The situation they're in gets weirder and weirder, but the nature of social etiquette keeps the characters quiet. The filmmakers keenly exploit people's innate impulse for side-stepping public displays of strangeness to conjure up an excellent sense of sustained tension. Carefully placed diversions keep us and protagonist Will (Logan Marshall-Green in a tour-de-force performance) on edge, constantly rethinking and reanalyzing the situation.Kusama is in no rush to tell her story. The film's pacing is what I term an onion. The layers peel back steadily, giving us only as much information as necessary. The brilliance of the editing lies in the film's alignment with Will. We never know more than him, and his perspective is the movie. Keeping us in step with Will's line of sight maintains the apprehension, feeding our uncertainty and doubt.However, the film's real power lies in its allegories. The shock and awe of its scares and surprises are all the more potent because of the emotional richness drawn from the themes and characters. There's a conflict embedded in the film, a questioning posited. When is self-forgiveness a mask for denial? Is one's awareness of death an honorable honesty or charlatan's façade? These internal battles play out in cataclysmic fashion, harrowing the characters and viewers alike to the bitter end."
" Good Story but not built well
",-0.0698,-0.2706,2020-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Karyn Kusama's 2015 film, The Invitation, was overall a below-average movie, in my opinion. I believe the concept of this movie was well drawn out, however, the execution of the film was lengthy, not entertaining, and quite frankly, annoying. The Invitation is like a kid's roller coaster, having the few little bumps, but at an extremely slow speed and just keeps going around in a circle. To start, the awkwardness of the film and characters do play into the curiosity and desire to understand as an audience what exactly is happening. The movie starts with absolutely no background other than the beginning scene, alluding to future struggles the group of friends ultimately face. This leaves the audience to have to pick up subtle hints throughout the movie, and not even understanding the problem until it's almost over, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The Invitation is marketed as a horror movie, and even has the low-key lighting that a typical horror film may have, but I would certainly not classify this film as a horror. The Invitation is a suspenseful mystery, with no real feeling of fear or horrific events that a normal horror movie would include. Moreover, the film was annoying because of its certainty that everyone knew what was coming, but it continued to drag on by introducing new information that ultimately led to the same result, only taking a longer time to figure out. The best part of this movie was obviously the end. The end was finally the thrill of the movie that makes you feel apart of the suspense that was unfolding throughout the entirety of the movie. In my opinion, this movie could be made better by getting rid of much of the boring beginning and start the exciting ending much sooner and drag that part out, leaving the audience to be strapped in, needing to figure out the clues and reasons behind the madness all while being trapped in the thrilling and unexpected part of the storyline. I do believe that the idea of The Invitation was a smart idea, with great clues, a good storyline, and twists, but it was given in a way that dragged on too long, only to be struck with the final bombshell in the last 20 minutes. I would not say this is a bad film, I just believe there was a better way to stagger the plot into a more thrilling story without an extended beginning."
" Horror Film Class Review
",-0.5719,-0.9518,2020-02-20 00:00:00,4,"In the movie The Invitation, tension builds through the use of Will and Eden's varied responses to their son's death. While Will takes the route that most people would take in letting the various stages of grief play out, Eden goes to Mexico to join a group that will allow her to be released from pain. The lighting helps create this tension because the lighting is often low key lighting given off by candles or lamps throughout the rooms. As the tension grows between Will, Eden and Eden's new husband David, the other guests are drawn into it. As the tension grows, the lighting seems to get darker. When the tension finally breaks during the final scenes, the lighting seems to shut off. It is during these final scenes, that it brought up thoughts of intertextuality with the Jamestown massacre and Heaven's Gate. The color red used in the lantern that David lights and the red of the wine that the victims are given foreshadows the death and destruction that is about to happen. The lack of lighting and the reminder that all the doors in the house are locked creates a feeling in the audience that they are just as trapped as those actually trapped in the house. Not only did the poisioned wine drinking remind me of actual historical events, the scenes that followed reminded me of the typical end scene of a horror movie, especially in movies like Halloween, Alien, and Nightmare on Elm Street. The rising tension leading up to the final scenes added to the suspense of the movie but seemed to make the movie longer than what it was. Until the final scenes, it was unclear what was actually going to happen to the victims, even if you knew the history of events like the Jamestown Massacre and Heaven's Gate."
" Suspenseful and Startling...A MUST SEE!!!!!
",0.0,0.7269,2020-02-20 00:00:00,10,"This film is suspenseful and dark. It's filled with tragedy, old friendships, and new mysterious friendships. The Invitation keeps you guessing the reasons for the gathering every step of the way. Karyn Kusana's direction of this cast was spot on in my opinion. The actor's portrayals of friends and mysterious guest were believable. Logan Marshall-Green's performance stands out. He is convincing in his role as Will the tortured father and ex-husband, who comes back to his former home after receiving an invitation from his ex-wife Eden. Will's skeptic observations and emotional roller coaster ride throughout the movie has you on the edge of your seat. The movie starts out slow but gradually builds up momentum to an explosive ending and a startling revelation. The low-key lighting mixed with the uncomfortable calm is eerie and adds to the tension and suspense surrounding these individuals. The Camera's close-up shots when Will has his memory flashbacks adds to his silent, but angry demeanor which draws the viewer in. John Carroll Lynch's character Pruitt is calm and disturbing from the time he appears in the film. The Invitation at times plays on your psyche and makes you question certain situations two or three times in the film. I truly enjoyed watching this entire movie. I connected with the character's and I was drawn into the story line. The ending of the film was surprisingly unexpected and a perfect ending in my opinion. The Invitation has all the main characteristics of a modern horror film and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a mix of mystery and horror."

" Ultimate dinner party deterrent.
",0.4019,0.9748,2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"This tautly constructed thriller manages a continual slow-burn build-up of unease, knowing just how to twist and grate, and when to throw in the odd jolt, to keep you from settling into a dinner-party comfort zone as the narrative sails its course through various dinner-party ups and downs to a decisively delivered final act.You will throughout the film find yourself yelling at the well-crafted characters, at times telling them to chill, and at other times imploring them to exit the dinner party, only to find yourself suddenly second guessing your instincts, as the characters' journey becomes your own. The director gives you space to see the lead protagonist's interactions with many of his friends, but doesn't allow you an objective view of events - your experience of his fractured night is subjective, and thus veiled by potentially distorting emotional baggage and mistrust. The world the director builds feels complex and textured, yet also claustrophobic and unsettling. Your inability to step back and see events in a broader context is the same constraint experienced by the key characters. This is masterful film making at work.This film has been blessed with a layered and nuanced attention to detail. Smart choices in classic mid-century modern architecture and interiors ensure a sense of warm familiarity - even if you don't hold dinner parties yourself, the voyeuristic shots of hushed conversations and personal moments through gaps in dark-wood doors should trigger childhood memories of being in orbit of similar soirées. Part of your brain is telling you that you should be comfortable in this plush setting, yet we are never allowed to settle into a comfortable corner. The director denies us a coherent mental map of the home that acts as the universe in which this tale unfolds; every location feels subtly isolated, building on the sense that there is more to this night than meets the eye, always something hidden off camera or around a corner. Camera angles and framing ensure we are gently pummelled by shots showing stairs and doors that lead to dark, mysterious nooks and crannies, or views from high or low positions where we are unable to relax. Is everything what it seems to be? Your thoughts and wishes regarding this will evolve as the film progresses.Well worth a watch."

The director plays with this element to create doubt and paranoia not just into the main character but also in us, we start to doubt everything and everyone....

Too many flashbacks that made us try to feel the pain of losing someone but it didn't work after the 5th or so.The character interactions to me, were very unrealistic. Your friends, even after not seeing them for a long time would never force you to stay or KEEP you in an uncomfortable situation. Also, real friends would not shush you when you speak out against a CLEAR and present danger. After the uncomfortable video and the confession of murder by John Carroll Lynch's character, everyone should have peaced out. Maybe it is somewhat realistic of people's politness and fakeness in S California. Either way, one person actually left. It was unnverving to me if she ACTUALLY got away so kudos ot the movie for that feeling.The big scene was pretty good but I wished Will would have not acted all surpised and stunned after he confirmed what he had been feeling all along about the hosts' intentions. I think some of the kills and actions were done for dramatic purposes and to have a dialogue but again, we don't really care about him and his ex-wife really. She is clearly psycho so her dying dramatically was kind of wasteful.Otherwise typical setup-dumb people die and a few smart ones actually fight back and win and get away.

Turned my browser (seeing on laptop) all the way up, yet could not make out who was doing what to whom exactly during the last, oh, fifth or sixth of the movie, and for the entire movie there was that frustrating desire to see the actors better, see what the scenes looked like better. To the extent I could see the actors as they were emoting, or supposed to be, they were either over-doing it in the case of one star, to the point of cartoonish, or not emoting at all in the case of the other star, at least so far as I could tell in the twilight. And another prime character just kept saying the same thing over and over. And this dark goings-on progressed very, very slowly. Yay, made it to the end. About all worth saying .

I still don't know why the first scene played out like it did. It still doesn't seem relevant and the title sequence is too elaborate and often the many flashbacks are just plain confusing.But for a narrative that plays out with such limited time and setting, there is a never moment that isn't charged with emotional baggage as characters with history try to move forward when the past is trying to pull them back.It's not just another interpersonal drama, but to simply call it a thriller would also be misleading. A movie with potentially many layers of nuance and character but even on its most obvious level plays as a fiercely compelling mystery with a great main character and a lot of very uncomfortable moments that ebb and flow masterfully."
" The Invitation incites audiences to attend the most anxiety-inducing dinner party ever.
",0.4522,-0.661,2020-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Grief. The melancholic turmoil of loss. A catalyst for unwanted prominent personality alterations that change the very fabric of who we are. Each individual experiences sorrow and subsists through a variety of different methods. Some forgive and forget. Others harness the inability to progress, experiencing a stumbling block of anguish as they continually inflict psychological suffering upon themselves. It is irrefutably the most difficult emotion to overcome, and can overwhelm the strongest of personalities. Kusama's thrilling episode of 'Come Dine With Me' gradually explores the weight of life itself, simply by allowing a group of long-time friends the chance to discuss such a topic. Yet, what enables Kusama's slow-burn thriller to elevate itself into the top echelon of effective profoundness, is its simplicity.There are no extravagant plot devices. No sublimely utilised twists. And certainly no misplaced character conveniences. By equipping grief and depression as a manifestation of the narrative, Kusama was able to demonstrate her incredibly astute direction through natural plausibilities. Will, portrayed accurately and captivatingly by Marshall-Green, exhumed indications of paranoia. A heightened consequence of his raging anguish. Constantly questioning the actions of other characters, such as locked doors, barred windows and unknown guests, he assumes the role of the audience's perception. We, as the viewer, examine and query each character reveal and emotional complexity simultaneously to Will's interrogative persona. He, essentially, is us. Instantly allowing viewers to relate to him in this unusual circumstance.Something is not right with this dinner party. He feels it. We feel it. But his instincts are muted by the other guests, naturally due to his heightened state of sorrow, in order to maintain a civilised appearance. That, right there, is the representation of depression. Forced to hide what we really are enduring, with despondent thoughts circling our synapses. It's abundantly intelligent on Kusama's part, who elevated the screenplay to the stratosphere of uneasy, anxiety-inducing storytelling. With the assistance of Shore's cinematography, constantly blurring the outskirts and backgrounds of frames to enhance personable abandonment and solitude, Kusama hosted one of the most engaging dinner parties I've ever attended. Inviting a naturally diverse cast of actors, ranging from different ethnicities to sexual orientation, who inhibit their own character qualities.An array of components culminating in a third act that switches from first gear to a gear with incalculable speeds. The wine was served, my heart rate increased. I required a towel, I was sweating that much from anxiety. Ignoring the last minute of the feature, which was an eye-rolling moment to say the least, a slow-burn thriller such as this utilises a substantial amount of foreshadowing as its narrative device. Unfortunately, it is inescapable. However, Hay and Manfredi do their utmost best to keep the conversation flowing during times of prognostication. Shapiro's score is also worth mentioning for its sharp string-based chords that increase the chance of sweaty palms.The Invitation, from the offset, is an incredibly simple thriller. Games are played, wine is served and a few arguments are bound to occur. However, if you cut through Kusama's simplistic exterior, you'll find an extraordinarily intelligent dinner party that evokes a powerful emotional connection. Just, y'know, think twice before accepting an invitation..."

The writer and director take advantage of the fact that you're expecting a horror movie. So play on that fact with a slow burn letting your anticipation build.But then you go over the top of that first hill, and there are about 15 minutes of action and a quick resolution. After the credits rolled, I was left feeling that the buildup just wasn't really worth the ride.It's not really a horror film, and it's not really thrilling. It's just meh. There's not a lot of blood and gore, there's not a lot of action, nor is there a lot of scares. Maybe I'd call it a weird and creepy drama with some murder involved. I thought the actors did a pretty good job, and I think the story had some potential. I think the pacing was off. I think the first act was way too long. It took up almost the entire movie. The second and third acts were only about 15 minutes long. I will say this; I was more interested in what was happening right before the credits rolled than anything else in this movie.I think the writer and director could have cut a good 30-40 minutes out of the first act, made the second act a little more thrilling, and maybe brought into the story a little more of what was going on with the red lanterns across LA. But that's just me.Still, I've seen worse movies, so I'm giving it a 5. Not a complete waste of time."

" Here's to hoping that we'll all spend the rest of our lives never having to go to a dinner party as much a nightmare as the one depicted
",0.6705,0.42,2019-12-13 00:00:00,7,"Between viewings of ""Clue"" and ""You're Next"" have I found that I much prefer watching dinner parties from hell than experiencing them firsthand. Granted, all I've had to sit through are a couple of awkward conversations at worst - I should consider myself lucky that I've never been quite literally trapped at a gathering nor stuck in the middle of a murderous scheme that involves me possibly getting offed. Karyn Kusama's sublimely slow burning ""The Invitation"" is no different in its subversive thrills than the aforementioned larks, though one would think that its characters would be slightly more apprehensive in their RSVPing considering the circumstances and the guest list. The film solely takes place (unless you count the cynical prologue) at a shindig at the home of Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and David (Michiel Huisman). The happy couple's been married for a few years now, but almost all their friends haven't seen them in two years - in store, as it's perceived, is an extensive reunion meant to take everyone back to what's distinguished as the ""good old days"". Things wouldn't be so immensely uncomfortable if not for the inviting of Will (Logan Marshall-Green), Eden's ex-husband. Having divorced due to the accidental death of their young son, tensions are underlined in a grief that makes the situation almost unbearable; from the moment this dinner party kicks off, the air is tinged in disconcertion so strong you'd maybe even be able to reach out and grab it if you tried hard enough. But it doesn't take long for it to become obvious that something else it at play within the posh walls of Eden and David's Hollywood Hills home. Have they perhaps invited their estranged friends over not to heal old wounds but to serve something more sinister than their guests realize? I'd better stop speculating over the details of the plot there for fear of spoiling too much - ""The Invitation's"" overture of thrills cascade over us so deliberately and so cautiously that to know too much in advance would potentially counteract the balancing act Kusama and her screenwriters, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, so exquisitely execute. Unraveling with the suspenseful agony of a bandage being taken off a nasty gash after a month's worth of recovering, the film gets everything just about right, its conversations increasing in their edge with delectable precision, its performances always understatedly mounting in their anxiety (or, depending on who we're taking about, their rancorousness). And the gleaming unspooling of ""The Invitation"" is not an easy thing to pull off - on display is confident filmmaking only a veteran of Kusama's sort could achieve. One could say that it's a comeback for the filmmaker, who broke out with 2000's ""Girlfight"" but was sidelined with the failures of the critically panned ""Æon Flux"" (2005) and the undeservedly underrated ""Jennifer's Body"" (2009). It's one of the best independent films of the year: ""The Invitation"" is a (brutally dark) comedy of manners with Buñuel in its head and Polanski in its heart. With a deliciously twisted ending acting as the cinematic cherry on top to the succulent sum of its parts, ""The Invitation"" is horror with enough emotional tugs and enough categorical terror to stick with you as a minor masterpiece not to be reckoned with. Here's to hoping that we'll all spend the rest of our lives never having to go to a dinner party as much a nightmare as the one depicted."

" A four-course masterpiece thriller
",0.6705,0.96,2019-11-30 00:00:00,8,"When you think of dinner parties, they hardly sound like uninviting settings (well, unless you attend one thrown by Walder Frey, but that's another ballgame). In Karyn Kusama's 'The Invitation,' we get to be a fly on the wall in what can only be described as a gathering that is probably not on anyone's ""can't miss"" list.The film is really carried on the shoulders of Logan Marshall-Green, whose Will attends a dinner alongside his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi). Oh, did I mention the dinner takes place in his old house and is hosted by his ex-wife (Tammy Blanchard) and her new Hollywood mogul husband (Michiel Huisman)? Awk. But that's just the beginning...As the film progresses, we're drawn into a trance. We notice a number of things that can't be right, or are unsettling to say the least. But is everyone else crazy, or are we the ones who misunderstand? Slowly but surely, pieces begin to fall into place, but there's always an iota of doubt that still hangs in the air. Among the more effective aspects of 'The Invitation' are the use of the camera, which lingers to create a sense of suspense, to heavy dialogue that paints the picture of the strength of the group's friendship, with the exception of those who are new to their circle.This film poses some thoughtful questions: at what point does being polite end up costing you? How do you discern between friendly suggestion and forceful coercion? And how do you simply put past tragedy behind you and pretend all is okay?'The Invitation' is an overlooked example of how suspense can be done smartly - with precise screenwriting, deliberate dialogue and subtle twists and turns."
" RSVP.
",0.0,0.9734,2019-11-27 00:00:00,8,"'The Invitation (2015)' works as a kind of reverse home-invasion thriller, with its lead being invited to an inadvertently painful reunion with his ex-wife and former friends in a luxury 'house in the hills'. The tension that subsequently ratchets ins't so much life-threatening as socially awkward, although there's always an undeniably enigmatic and, even, unsettling vibe. This is mainly due to the movie's excellent sense of tone and atmosphere, which brilliantly puts us in the perpetually perturbed protagonist's always-on-edge mindset. The piece takes care to make sure we aren't certain of its true nature, managing to twist our expectations just enough for the affair to be, ultimately, rather unpredictable. The explosive finale does a great job of delivering on the unspoken promise of the long build-up that precedes it, even if it may be slightly more generic than the affair actually deserves. Even then, the flick does a fantastic job of feeling fresh, keeping you on your toes even as it treads into well-worn territory. It has a cracking set of characters, most of whom get just enough time to be individually empathetic, and a great dynamic between them, which often smoothly alternates from friendly and warm to strained and suspicious. By the time the previously mentioned finish arrives, you aren't quite sure whose side to be on. This is especially invigorating when you consider that it's something most pictures patently fail to do. It's all very engaging and equally as enjoyable. It's a great, well-rounded piece with some rough-around-the-edges but compelling performances and a sharply slow-burning story. 8/10"

Even the initial scenario of attending a dinner party with your ex and their new partner after years without contact is far-fetched.But even if you can let that go, it's not long until things really do start to get silly. The main characters are rightly suspicious of their guests from the start but, even as things in the house and the behaviour of the hosts starts to creep them out, they decide to stay anyway. Of course, there would be no film if they didn't, but it's all very predictable and unrealistic.I can never fully invest in mystery/thriller like this if the story doesn't seem plausible, or if the characters act in a way that nobody would in real life.

Things are weird, and get weirder... I guess.The rave reviews for this film are truly baffling, as it was one of the most soulless, dull films I've had the misfortune of sitting through in recent memory. Director Karyn Kusama was mildly effective with the tongue-in-cheek horror comedy ""Jennifer's Body,"" but fails on all fronts with the more straight-laced, serious material. There is no sense of fear, no sense of unease, and no sense of threat--all because none of these people feel real or can be identified with.The film's cardinal sin is that its writing is trite and utterly artificial-feeling; none of the characters ring true, none of the circumstances or interpersonal dynamics feel genuine, and none of the actors are strong enough to even slightly invigorate the anemic writing. In a film that is as slow-burn in approach as this is, the writing needs to be top-notch, but it is abjectly bad. The modes in which characters speak are laughable, and attempts to highlight ""awkward social navigation"" moments fall flat on their faces. The performances overall are only slightly above that of a high school drama production, though it's difficult to tell where it is the fault of the performers and where it is the fault of the abysmal dialogue.While there are a couple of creepy moments peppered in, the film is a failure as a thriller, and not any better as a drama, nor a horror film. It does ramp up slightly in the last 20-30 minutes, but by that point, it's difficult to care what happens to these facsimiles of characters.

No, I'm not gonna say that it bored me or put me to sleep, because it wasn't a poorly made movie by any means. It's just that it let me (as a horror fan) down. A lot of horror fans are recommending this as a nice slowburn horror movie, which I don't see at all. Had they gotten a little weirder and a littler dirtier with this story, and maybe used the Sadie and Pruitt characters better, then maybe we might have something.There were things I liked, like the very ending. That was a pretty haunting image. I loved the Sadie character played by Lindsay Burdge. She was absolutely phenomenal. She was the only weird and horrific thing about this movie. She's the reason why I can't give this movie a 1/10. Because honestly, this movie without the Sadie character, is just a whinny little drama, where some people happen to end up dead."

It's one that I'd probably be interested in watching again to see if there might be some hidden stuff along the way, my guess is no, but it would still likely be an enjoyable watch. I'm glad that I've got another one knocked off my Netflix list too and doubly glad that it wasn't a steaming hot pile of garbage. Seriously, I've subjected myself to some stuff on there that I'm not really even sure if there's one positive thing to say.

I couldnt it seriously after that last scream sounding like some ancient call for a mythological creature XD That was the monumental blow that took this film from creepy and morbid to down right bad acting hilariousness.

Will and his senses tell him that something is and something dark is about to or might happen, and he still stays. No this No that, and then boom Gina gets poisoned, his boyfriend Choi shot. Altogether the pattern of Will's consistent No's throughout the movie is questionable. The Screenplay is questionable, it's flow is questionable. It's QUESTIONABLE. Will's persistent refusal to leave the party, provoke a kind of telenovela vibe, just to extend the a scene on to another, to its end. A forced, and pretentious slow build-up."

The film does a lot with a very simple premise and the whole film being shot on one location.
The film uses its miscellany of characters to show different ways of dealing with death, grief and social discomfort.

Also, it kind of doesn't make sense for a suicide cult to want to take others down with them. What was their motive? If they wanted to ""join"" their deceased loved ones, they could have done so without killing so many others. We also never find out what happened to the lady who left the house early on. Was she killed too? And why was no one besides the main character alarmed by the fact that the homeowners could lock people IN the house? David gave a sorry excuse about there being break ins in that area, but the point of locks should be to keep people OUT. *Sigh* the more you think about this film, the worse it gets.

" Contrived plot and way too slow
",0.0,-0.9793,2019-08-04 00:00:00,4,"I normally do not write reviews, but people should be given a fair warning to avoid this stinker.While I can appreciate what the director has tried to do here, that is make a tense psychological thriller that slowly draws you in, The Invitation falls short in just about every department.The plot is pretty standard stuff. A couple is invited to a lavish reunion dinner with old friends. The occasion being that the hosts abruptly disappeared and went to Mexico for two years. You know, the kind of stuff people do all the time.But something does not seem right. The hosts are just too friendly and for unexplained reasons invite mysterious guests that are complete strangers to everyone but them. Hardly your typical reunion, but alright - it's a movie. Suspension of disbelief and all that.However the plot takes a turn for the worse. How on earth am I supposed to believe that there is no cell coverage in a fancy LA suburb? Are we in the United States or some third world country?This annoyed me to no end because the story hinges on the very fact that the guests are trapped and can't call for help. Add in that the hosts keep all the doors locked and had iron bars installed on every window and the prize for guessing what happens next is the grand amount of zero.Still The Invitation manages to become even more ridiculous. For what purpose would anyone want to kill their long time friends? What possible motivation could explain such behaviour? The answer: the hosts joined a suicide cult while in Mexico. Apparently is killing your loved ones the road to salvation when you're struggling with the death of a child and coke addiction.A movie does not have to be realistic, but what motivates the main characters has to make sense or else they're not believable. That is definetly not the case with The Invitation.The ending is also pretty weak. For even more unexplained reasons this suicide cult has gotten incredibly popular in said LA suburb where the movie takes place.Why? Did they all go to Mexico at the same time and decided to buy houses in the exact same neigbourhood to fulfill their newly acquired urge to commit suicide while having dinner? Forget about getting some thinly veiled explanation to this, you'll have to figure it out all by yourself.This movie is beyond stupid. Stay clear unless you're a glutton for high blood pressure."

It released 2 years before this film, and is a 1000 times better than this film, and had a similar premise and background as this film, but with a brilliant scifi story, screenplay, mature and sensible acting. The Invitation is no match to that masterpiece, however I'm giving a 6 to this film only for the huge potential it had and the eery atmosphere it set up.

It's very difficult to find horror/thriller movies that have a good plot, story line, characters and acting and this one is no exception.
Logan marshal Green (American Tom hardy) gives a phenomenal performance as the broken ex husband, and that doesn't mean to say he's the only one in this movie that gets a gold star, the rest of the cast give incredibly convincing performances.The character development is subtle yet fluid, the plot is innovative and sinister, the music is graceful yet dark, and the progression from comfort to sheer unsettling terror is perfection.You go through the first 3 segments of the film knowing something is wrong with increasing tenacity yet you have no clue as to what is going to happen, which then crescendos into an extremely satisfying ending.If you enjoy edge of your seat tension and suspense, beautiful cinematography and expert editing, incredible acting then this is the horror/thriller for you."

In fact, I just created my account to write a review about this movie.The Invitation is like a slow burning sensation which you enjoy after some time. Halfway through, you would feel first half is boring and later is very much predictable but in 2nd half your would feel first half was much much better than the later.Seems like writers spent most of the time in writing first half and kept gruesome things fixed for later.Movie could have been better if twisted with Will imagining all the things, getting suspicious, afraid and shocked so much by the death of his child that he lost his mind. Even a simple dinner party with close old friends seemed suspicious to him and he threw random guess on the table which eventually turned on him every time. He started killing in self defence but in reality everyone just wanted to hangout."

If you enjoy a slow-burn of a horror movie that builds its horror in tiny steps along the lines of say ""Rear Window"", ""Audition"" or ""The Shining (this film isnt quite in their league but, it owes plenty to them) all the while increasing that I don't wanna be here, I want to get out of here feeling until the big reveal... and then it's too late. This might be your kinda film.I don't want to give any of the plot away, any of it. Going in blind, just like the movie's protagonist is the way to go with this one. Myself I was told to see it in much the same manner as I tell you now.Now I tried to watch it twice never getting past the 15 minute mark, it's that slow at the onset. But a good review from a friend that knows how much I enjoy horror that doesn't rely on gore or cheap jump gimmicks.Good horror that builds its fears and tension by well done storytelling. If you enjoy ""that kind"" of horror movie give this one a shot. Once you get past those first 10-15 minutes you'll begin to feel that dread that's telling you something is really wrong here. You may, like the character in the movie, want to get up and leave. But by then, it might be too late for you too."

well movie gives you everything you want in a Mental Horror+ Drama it drives you crazy and gets you in the moment where you doubt your own direction and never understand what is happening.
The first 70% of the movie is really good and unbelievable interesting and driving however the ending well f... it it was just silly and the main idea following the movie from the shadow that some idiotic group of people are doing some stupid things.
Once more i just think that this movie deserved better ending than this rather then some type of ""supernatural"" happening, 70 % of the movie was just straight 8 grade however the ending was 4-5 and my final grade is 6, a solid one :D"

Wasn't paying attention 100% but I thought I grasped the whole movie. Then I came here and started reading the reviews and when I saw so many 9 and 10 stars and some of reviews were positively glowing. I figured what the heck did I not 'get' about this movie. One reviewer said there was one twist after another and the final twist at the end was wonderful. I didn't see it that way. Eden is all crazy delusional happy, so I figured she was going to unhinge herself. Then the cult video and sermon. Oh, just so that we might catch on, Eden and her new husband has a crazy housemate straight out of Helter Skelter, and just to ram it into our skulls her name was Sadie, which was Susan Atkin's Manson Family nickname. Anyway, the movie started strangely where the protagonist Will hits a coyote driving to the dinner, and mercy kills it with a tire iron. I have no clue why that scene was even in the movie. So, they get there, no one really has any past except the Asian chick who was wild in college. Everyone else? Just random people that we know nothing about, and at least for me, care nothing about.The only reason why I give it 2 stars was because I watched it twice to try to see what I was missing the first time. Nothing. Just a pointlessly long buildup to a Jim Jones, Helter Skelter finale. I don't recommend this movie."

" I don't understand the hype. It's terrible.
",-0.4767,0.7248,2019-03-30 00:00:00,2,"I adore horror movies, even psychological, mystery-filled thrillers, so I assumed this would be one of those. I saw the great reviews, and thought, ""Sounds awesome!""
No. Just no.
Literally watched the entire first hour of the film with a creeped-out, yet frustrated look. Most of the characters are intriguing and realistic, sure, but the couple who threw the party was absolutely creepy. I legitimately felt uncomfortable every time I saw them. Their acting-flawless. They played the part well.
But, I sat down to watch a thriller. A mystery. A horror. Anything exciting. Is that what I got? Absolutely not. I asked myself several times why I was still watching this boring, awkward reunion, cult creepfest, and I just kept thinking, ""Give it a chance. It has great reviews-It'll get better.""
Finally, an hour in exactly, the main character gets the phone call about Choi being already at the house. Finally, some excitement!
But no. Choi shows up, and the others wave off any suspicions. At this point, I start to assume the main character, Will, might just be crazy. Was this all in his head?
Then, after the big reveal about his dead son, he goes and watches the video on the laptop from the cult leader.
This was the point I thought, ""There's less than half an hour left-Is this really how it's going to end? He's going to accept their happy-go-lucky life??""
But the zing moment of climax, where he suddenly freaks out about the toast, is when it goes haywire. Everyone starts dying, and I'm thinking, ""I waited all this time...for this?"" A predictable ending of the main couple being the only survivors-aside from one friend, who surprisingly lived-and then they do the BIG, big reveal, that it was a mass, suicide/homicide freak-show extravaganza with the red lights somehow being their communication. And that was it.
Now, listen. I understand the drama-filled, tension-building, edge-of-your-seat story the writers were going for, but they fell short. It was boring, creepy, unlikable, and I had no desire to continue even a third of the way through except for the small hope that it would get better eventually.
And it did... Sort of. But all it left me with was frustration and a feeling of wasting an hour and a half of my time. Which it did.

First thing what hit me was tragically bad play of the actors and dramatically soulless and stupid dialogues. My first association was immediately ""The room"". But let's face it- the room was at least funny.
However, at this stage I was hoping that at least plot will safe everything. We all know movies with quite poor budget and even bad technical side which turned out to be interesting. But no, it is not one of these movies. During 90% of The Invitation nothing practically happens. Atmosphere is just weird due to bad play and stiff retarded dialogues but weird not in the interesting or attractive way. On the end happens exactly this what most of the people probably expect from start at some degree.
The only positive side of this movie is that the end could be a good introduction for some slasher.Not worth anyone's time and don't trust the positive opinions as I did. I think it must be some trolls who write them."

After that absence will meets Kira and they both get an invitation to a dinner party with eden and her new boyfriend David.. this is where the suspense starts and once it starts you don't get too much action but more of a jigsaw puzzle that you will try and put together in your head. Without spoiling anything you'll know and find out things don't add up which will starts to piece together.Did I enjoy this movie? Yes.. Was it dry at times Yes... and do I recommend seeing it.. yeah.. but I would know going into the film that it has amazing sequences but they could have added a little more in the places where there wasn't much going onI'm rating this a 7/10 you can find it on Netflix or at your local movie store
" I invite you to go watch it
",0.1531,0.852,2019-03-03 00:00:00,7,Just your average mystery horror movie. Nothing to write home about in this one. The only and the biggest issue being that this movie is extremely predictable. It's almost like the toned down version of the movie Get Out. Except Get Out wasn't predictable at all. There's not a lot to review about this movie except you just go watch it. The Invitation only deserves 6 stars from me but the only reason I gave it a 7 was it's ending. The ending in my opinion was the perfect ending for a mystery movie. A big issue with horror/thriller/mystery movies nowadays is the delivery of the ending. I get that it being a mystery it's meant to be confusing. But most movies overdo it. However in The Invitation they do it just right. I'm not going to spoil it for you instead I recommend you to go watch it. It'll be worthwhile.

",-0.4215,0.8862,2019-02-09 00:00:00,4,"Last night's movie was ""The Invitation"" 2015
Currently available on Netflix. The description for the movie was vague but Mrs. Dread and I decided to give it a chance.
The premise was implausible. I wouldn't go to a dinner party hosted by my ""ex"" or the ""ex"" of my significant other. Let's throw in a dead child that the ""ex"" and I had and are still experiencing massive amounts of guilt and grieve over.
Then EVERYTHING GOES HORRIBLY WRONG.
🚧🚨🚧🚨🚧🚨🚧🚨🚧🚨spoilers ahead🚨🚧🚨🚧🚨🚧
Turns out the dinner party wasn't just a chance to reconnect with old friends. The ""ex"" and her new husband have just returned from a commune in Mexico and are on a recruiting drive.
(Raise your hand if you would leave this party before the appetizers were served.)
Then the hosting couple ( weird smiles on their faces ) play a video for the guests of a women dying amongst cult members. They play a weird party game which causes one guest to finally say she feels uncomfortable and she leaves ( or does she ).
The story goes on... the ending is good but the events that lead up to it just don't make sense or I'm just antisocial and don't go to enough dinner parties to understand what is and what is not acceptable behavior. Out of 4 skulls I give it a 1.5 Skull rating. The Mrs agrees."

" Strong acting, relentless tension, relatable.
",0.296,0.988,2019-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Will is such a relatable character- emotional, considered, observational, strong-willed, responsible, and relentless. This actor did a stellar job in this role and I was reminded of myself- every decision he made I felt as though it was one I would make, he is headstrong and decisive. A standout performance from this actor. The story is ""predictable"" in the best way, it continually makes you doubt yourself but forces you to acknowledge the evidence and trust your instinct, just as Will does. The entire cast resembles a familiar friend group to most viewers I'm sure, making this quite relatable throughout. The way the actors consistently convinced each other everything is ok is a wonderful example of cognitive disonence within a group. The tension within is constant and heartbreaking at times, leaving me absolutely engaged.This movie is so much more than it's ending, which holds a nice little kick at the very end. Watch this for a very strong lead performance and to test your strength in your own instinct."

I will start with what is good about this movie: It does keep you on edge, not sure who to trust etc therefore keeping that suspense (which is what you want with a thriller). Acting and cinematography was also pretty good.
But ultimately, it's just way too predictable. I guessed what the ending was going to be about 20 minutes into the film and BANG, that exact scenario happened (I don't want any spoilers so I won't state how it was obvious, but trust me, you will guess the ending quickly also).The reason why this annoyed me so much is, because there is very little happening in the film up until the final 15/20 minutes and like I said it was the exact ending I expected. So, to me, it just felt like an utter waste.Am I being harsh with 3 stars? Maybe. But, overall the predictability of it all was too annoying to get past. Like I said, there are positives to this film, but ultimately the negatives over haul them."

There were moments throughout the movie that I found myself looking into the backdrop, desperately hoping for something to happen - nothing did. One can claim that there are 'little details' happening throughout the movies, but in all honesty, for me, these details were not all that satisfying, or mysterious. It wasn't until 76 minutes and 58 seconds into the movie that my craving for something of substance was satisfied. At the very least, if a movie does this and follows through with a solid, climactic ending, it still has potential for redemption - this movie did not. It has an anti-climactic last 5 minutes, with a semi-satisfying ending. Overall I was not thoroughly impressed by any aspect of this movie, I give it a 6 because I think it had potential, and there are brief, fleeting, moments of the movie that were enjoyable, but I can't score it higher due to it's lack of content or individuality."

Several times the man mentions he doesn't feel safe and that something odd is going on and yet he never leaves. They are locked into this home with bars on the windows and the man points these things out and still stays for dinner/desert, was he really that hungry? He willingly not only keeps himself, but also his girlfriend, in this unsafe environment. This honestly annoyed me throughout the entire film and the only thing I could come up with as his reason to stay is that his dead son is connected to the home. And of course the ending leaves loose ends. I dislike loose ends. I want to know why this cult felt the need to kill others in order to ""transcend""? Even if it is a stupid cult logic, I wish they would have ended with the cult video explaining the need for the massacre. Dispite these things I would still recommend this film to others."

The rest is just waiting for it to get there.There was so little plot that the second major bit of foreshadowing (lighting the lamp) was an obvious tip off for the end.Acting wasn't bad, but the characters didn't feel relatable and instead of building tension, most of the film felt like filler before the big finale, which in all fairness, was startling in the way it began, although not surprising.Didn't hate it while watching it, but felt ripped off at the end.

Maybe The Invitation isn't technically reinventing Horror completely, but it's no doubt a unique take on a genre that is always lacking originality. My type of horror is either the one that takes its time or the one that creates a creepy atmosphere with a psychological background to it. One could say that The Invitation does all of those things and more. It's not necessarily the most talented or well-known cast, but each of them do right by their roles and are fantastic individually. But the real standout is the direction from Karyn Kusama. Always keeping me on the edge of my seat and executing a third act so radical and expecting that my jaw slowly started to drop towards the floor. The music is great as well, which contributed to that tension throughout. There's also a lot more than just surface character stuff, the theme of grief is powerfully present throughout the film and I was extremely impressed by where that story goes and how it's ultimately handled.

We focus on the main character´s grief, which in the end isn´t that important, while the other characters are completely ignored. One tiny conversation with each one of them, that´s all we know. The girlfriend Kira literally disappears for an hour. It often feels like Will is all by himself in that house. Suspicion gets bigger but none of the guests seem to care about anything. There are some small comments, of course, but we have 5 or 6 characters devoid of any personality or will. I feel like some events could have been much stronger if those characters weren´t merely filling the space.There are some fine things, though, I´d never wanted to punch John Carroll Lynch so hard in the face. The same goes for Lindsay Burdge."

The last 5 seconds of the film really puts that into perspective! I love the foreshadowing from the begenining of the film! Right to the end! We're all just road kill moving forward trying to survive this word! And some ppl will do anything to get rid of that pain! It's great acting and a great script! I will be thinking about this film for awhile! I can understand some people mind not have the patients for this film! But it's just like a novel!

" Mediocre at best
",0.6369,-0.3293,2018-08-27 00:00:00,3,"First of all, this movie is really boring, simply due to the fact all the action is confined to the last 20 minutes, eventhough the runtime is 100 minutes on the dot. We are left with next to no action here, just waiting for the obvious, the main character tells you what is going to happen right from the start, you can choose to believe him or not, that's not the problem here. They could have made the ending different by twisting it somehow, but they decided to go for the blatantly obvious ending everyone anticipated.People are trying to pass this movie as clever and deep, which it isn't in the slightest, the plot is extremely linear start to finish with a couple of stupid flashbacks in the middle, which are just a pathetic attempt at making this movie more complex, eventually none of that matters, since as i said the plot is linear and the story unfolds exactly like you thought it would.Acting here is somewhat bareable, not the worst acting ever, the movie is nicely made too, just to give some posittives, if it wasn't for the obvious, linear plot and the action being confined to the last 20 minutes it could have been a great hostage thriller, i really hate when writers have a fairly decent premise, but choose to run it down the drain.Overall, this movie is really plain and simple, could even say flat out boring, since there is nothing but a dinner party happening for the majority of the screentime. Not your greatest horror watch!"
" I've seen worse movies
",-0.4767,0.9678,2018-08-20 00:00:00,8,"The premise of the film told me it wouldn't be a deep film, however, it does have content.It is an enjoyable thriller with spot on performances.
The flashbacks work as a great device for character development and go right to the message of the picture.
Camera work and background music add to the atmosphere of the film.There are problems with believability, I'm sad to say. But I've seen worse movies and the 'bad guys' didn't reveal much until the very end.
Ending to which I go now, felt like a lazy wrap up. Perhaps because I liked the movie I didn't like that it ended so abruptly. Although perhaps that was the director's intention.Overall I liked it. I liked its message. And that's not something I say about many thrillers (which generally bore me to death). It's not the kind of movie I expected. It has great ups and great downs. But it will get you by a nice time of movie watching."

I know I did. I stretched and writhed and adjusted my position and otherwise did everything imaginable to stay awake. Talk about slow burning!Thankfully, it does pick up steam. In fact, the ending is so different from the beginning that you'd swear you were looking at two different flicks. Was this a ""must watch"" movie? Not really. There were a few original ideas present in it, but otherwise, nothing to really write home about. The ending was the best part, though, so there's that."

As such, I sit through mindless murder and inconceivable plots. This, however, was somewhat refreshing. I enjoyed it. The characters were developed to the point of conceivable validity and the plot bursts open at almost the right point. It has you casting fingers and pontificating plots and, while the eventuality doesn't stray far from the well trodden path, you won't be too disappointed with the ending.

This movie was such a disappointment that I feel that I should be reimbursed for emotional distress (bored into tears). Whatever you think your time is worth whether it's $1 an hour or $1,000 dollars an hour you're better off just taking that amount of money and physically throwing it in the trash. That's how ripped off you'll feel after wasting an hour and twenty minutes on nothing but mindless small talk by the dinner guests, corny flashbacks, and intense stares from the protagonist. Only to get to the climax, which is much like a selfish lover; unsatisfying, quick, and with no apology or explanation."

It's like the producers, the writers, the directors, the actors and the rest of the staff tried they hardest to make the worst possible movie ever. Not even funny bad, just bad.

The tonality of the movie is like playing a piano and pressing all of the notes with your face, basically banging your head upon the keys in an attempt to make beautiful music, but as expected, all you get is noise and a headache. 
It's as if the directors and the screen writers and the actors and the rest of the team collectively tried their very best to make the worst piece of garbage possible.

And the ending was predictable and just """"ok"""" at beast.

Again, only one individual that appears aware of a possible setup.Thirdly, why the only individual who was aware of the cult motives lets his emotions over take him a few times is beyond me. If he was a little more perspective, then he could had quietly left. Social pressure kept him at the house. The constant, ""I'm sorry."" Why label thyself sorry? Nobody owes anyone an apology for anything. I criticized the movie a little, but overall it was very good. The last few minutes of the movie was my favorite scene."

",-0.2924,0.0454,2018-06-21 00:00:00,6,"I have mixed feelings about this one. I usually like these kind of thrillers, you know when a bunch of people are locked up in a place and usually just one or two survives. And while I found the premise interesting, and the cult trick very intriguing, the chain of events weren't as exciting as I thought they would be. I have to admit it was the first time in a film that my ideas of how they story should unfold was way more intriguing than what it actually happened. Also, while it was filled with the right amount of darkness and acting was overall very good, i think there was a problem with actors' chemistry. They weren't really giving the impression of being a group of besties that are connected by a tragedy; they were just good actors who happened to be in a movie together, if you know what i mean."

No, no it's not, the mood of everything is just kinda dark, like there is something amiss, and that is reaffirmed when two faces there are complete strangers, except to Eden and David... and then it all comes out...

The Invitation's storyline wanders in different directions and with some ambiguous dialogue and overuse of flashbacks, the movie makes for a tangled plot leaving the viewer frequently guessing on the next scenes. The writers did a decent job at deception, throwing curve balls on what may happen with the ending. Also, more importantly the writers created just enough foreshadowing throughout the film that one could possibly guess how the film ends. The Invitation is a reputable choice on Netflix, gives the viewers a chance to watch some up incoming actors and actresses as well as a couple of thrills."
" Keeps you Guessing - Great Atmospheric Thriller
",0.6705,0.9828,2018-05-10 00:00:00,8,A chilling thriller about a guy and his friends invited to the home of his ex-wife and new husband for a reunion. There is clearly something weird about the hosts but is it all in his mind. The film is a perfect example of how good atmospheric film making can convert an interesting script into an above average thriller. Must watch and arguably the best last 20 mins of all 2016 movies I have seen. Recommend not watching the trailer at all to enjoy it even more.
" Stressful
",-0.5106,-0.2635,2018-05-06 00:00:00,8,"The way this film was billed on Netflix catalogue, and its placement in the ""Horror"" category, turned me off of it for the longest time, suspecting it would be something decidedly un-scary and slasher-y. Eventually, exhausting much of my other options over time, I came back to this and gave it a try.
Slow in the way it unfolds, it nevertheless goes beyond the initial ""social awkwardness of a reunion among adult friends after several years"", exacerbated by the suddenly disturbing revelation of Eden's newfound creepy cult-ish pseudoscience beliefs and her abruptly slapping one of the friends for calling it crazy.Backstory comes when it is needed, often in the form of flashbacks and condolences as we learn Will used to be married to Eden, until they lost their child. Now Will remains slightly remote, distant, perpetually staring and watching everyone else, as much on edge as me the viewer.
Restricting us to the point of view of the protagonist Will, we go through the night of a reunion house party where despite the unusual things that come up (a random guy played by John Carrol Lynch drops by, Eden and her new husband David show a cult-like promotional video depicting a woman dying of cancer on camera, a game of ""What I Want"" becomes overly intrusive, Eden's stash of phenobarbital is discovered, Sadie throws herself at Will and Gina), nothing happens which could be flat out labelled ""Not Normal"" and prompting a dropping of the masquerade of polite friendliness. Even a tense sequence where it seems that Will has ""caught"" Eden and David in some shenanigans is abruptly defused when a missing party attendant suddenly shows up.Rather than spoil any other aspect of the film as other reviews are liable to do or hint to, i'll just leave the review as it is now. This was a thoroughly stressful, intense experience remarkable for how little actually happens, leaving it entirely to our instincts to keep us perpetually on edge, partly out of nervous paranoia, partly out of expectation, since this is a movie. it makes me very glad I do not have many friends in real life"

It seems like the great reviews are great and the less forgiving say its the boring word. Well, I just created an account to say I LOVED this frigging movie and wished it went forever to be honest.Perhaps it's the mood you're in at the time but I love horror, thriller, gory movies and sometimes it's hard to find something that keeps me enthralled and my heart rate up. Maybe I'm getting old but this movie did it. Its not ""fast paced"" by any means but my goodness it's addictive and engaging.Its no Rob Zombie Devil's Rejects nor Saw, nor anything else I've seen... Just saw Green Room and it was ok but nothing I'd start an account about....If you're feeling raucous.. wait til later but if you're in a dark, quiet room with some grog (wine, beer, whiskey), please choose this and I hope you end up muttering your thoughts to yourself as you decide whether our protagonist's thoughts are real or not.

Who is sane and who is no...so sane. But I will say this; it is one of the best indie thrillers I've seen the latest years. You cannot really see where it's going at all until the very end, even partly until the last 30 seconds, and it's a bit of a shocker in its scope.

See it for yourself!"
" A chilling and memorable thriller that has a lingering impact
",0.0772,0.4403,2018-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Going into this movie I knew nothing about it so had no expectations, yet found myself hooked within the first 15 minutes. From the get go there's this underlying tension and mystery that has you trying to guess what's going to happen next. The main character, Will, is a surprisingly empathetic character in comparison to most leads in thriller/horror movies. As a viewer you really feel that you're experiencing the evening through his eyes and although his state of mind is constantly in question, his actions are often completely justified and reasonable from the perspective of any sane person. The tension is slowly built upon throughout and you can feel the plot progressing in a pre-determined direction. Although in parts it's predictable, everything that happens is a perfect pay-off, which negates the predictability. Despite the fact that we don't learn a great deal about any the characters (except Will), they're all very realistic people that have unique personalities, which again is something that is rarely found in the supporting characters of movies. Furthermore, the friendships between the characters were also well portrayed. As a viewer, it really feels like you're watching a bunch of good friends that have fallen out of touch with each other's lives and are trying to find their rhythm again. But one of my favourite things about The Invitation which seems to be overlooked by a lot of people, is the underlying theme of grief. The whole movie acts as a metaphor for grief and how it deeply it affects people. Every character in the movie has been affected by the same loss (even if just by association) and they're all dealing with it in an incredibly different way. I think this is what takes the movie from being a traditional thriller/slasher to something much more complex, because despite appearances, there's a much more complex meaning behind it. The only reason this movie didn't get the full 10 stars from me is because the ending is a little anti-climatic after such a long build-up. There's one particular scene towards the end that's incredible, but after that everything sort of unravels rather erratically. However, the very last scene is haunting and adds to the impact of the movie as a whole. Overall, I loved this movie and would definitely recommend it to anyone that's a fan of thought provoking thrillers that encompass very real and relatable human emotions that we all struggle through."

Some of the characters's actions are questionable and a few moments are too forced, like Will's memories interfering with the reality.

Some nice twists as well!It could have been great, except for: 1. The dinner talk sounded phony. Not real. They should have actually gone to some real dinner parties and recorded the conversations to come up with something more realistic. Some of it was cringy.2. Will was too suspicious at the very beginning. From the moment he got there, he's always frowning, unhappy. He should have started out less suspicious and gradually built it up. He should have been more friendly and outgoing at the beginning. Of course, he's the hero so he needs to start getting more and more suspicious later.3. The talk of the cult leader didn't sound real, except the scene at the end. They should have researched some real cult leaders and maybe made a composite of them (Jim Jones, the Waco, Texas David Koresh, others). Other than that it was great, the suspense starts out slowly and builds up until you are sitting on the edge of your seat. Really good! Really fun and great ending. John Carroll Lynch as ""Pruit"" was especially good. Mysterious stranger, and you didn't like him from the start. He played it beautifully! I love actors that can really act, like he's a completely different person then when you see him in other movies. (Unlike, say, Clint Eastwood who pretty much just plays himself, doesn't even have to act...) If I had to vote for best actor, I would vote for John Carroll Lynch in this movie. Also Lindsay Burdge as ""Sadie"" was great! (Any reminders of Sexy Sadie of the Manson Family at all???) Overall very good. It's hard to find a good movie these days, finally found one! Slightly upsetting, unnerving, and nail-biting-inducing though..."

It made an impression.The best horror films often don't have a supernatural explanation. They are stories that can't be dismissed as implausible. ""Psycho"" is the classic, but films such as ""Wolf Creek"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Prisoners"" and ""Irreversible"" are horrific and deeply disturbing, but without the supernatural safety net that allows us to feel it just couldn't happen. Interestingly, there is a scene in ""The Invitation"" that pays no small homage to a scene in ""Irreversible"".Will (Logan Marshall-Green) accepts an invitation to a dinner party with his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard), and her new husband, David (Michiel Huisman). He is taking along his new girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi). There are other guests at the party, some Will has met before and others he hasn't. We only get to know the characters by their first names: Will, Kira, Eden, David, Ben, Gina, Miguel, Tommy, Sadie, Choi, and the rather out of place, big older guy, Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch).As often happens when alcohol starts to loosen everyone up, the conversation gets onto subjects best left alone. In this case the subject of death and grieving becomes a real party killer.Without spoiling things too much because there are surprises here, Will has an uneasy feeling that everything is not right about this gathering. As we learn more of his backstory, we suspect he may be right.""The Invitation"" takes a while to get going and in the dimly lit house it isn't always easy to work out who is doing what to whom. The fact that Will and David both have beards doesn't add to the clarity. However ""The Invitation"" has a disturbing mood. The ending reminded me of the ending of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" where there was no easy answer and we are left wondering.""The Invitation"" wasn't what I was expecting; it's one that stayed with me."

" Journeys and Destinations
",0.0,-0.9984,2017-10-12 00:00:00,9,"I was intrigued by The Invitation due to the (seriously) glass of red wine on the poster. It looked at once mature and alluring but also incredibly dark. I convinced my brother to watch it with me one night and this is our story.The Invitation sets itself up as a dark tale from the opening scene. A car ride ends in disaster and our hero, while going to his ex- wife's home for a dinner party, has to put an animal out of its misery. Will is unreadable, clearly suffering some form of PTSD. His girlfriend is supportive but it's obvious she's kept outside of his thought processes. When they arrive at the dinner party, it's hard to believe they know any of the guests. Actually, they've all been friends for years but, as anyone who's ever gone to a dinner part would know, it can be hard to be comfortable when there is a giant, dead elephant in the room. Everyone is at once eerily cheery but also naturally superficial. Is it Will's attitude that's causing conversation to stop dead every time people are reminded of his presence?Eden enters and you realise she's struggling just as much as Will. Eden is Will's ex, newly remarried and eager to show off the lifestyle that has brought her peace. It's revealed that their son died in an accident and that the grief and blame tore the couple apart. The difference between Eden and Will is, she's trying (not very well, mind you) to get over it. And so there you have it. A middle-class dinner party that is about grief and madness and red wine. The guests are trying hard to forget the ugliness of the tragedy that rendered all their lives and Will is doing his damndest to drag the corpse into the light for everyone to gape at. Who's really crazy here? Is it the middle-class manners that mean avoiding harsh topics and not allowing your friends the chance to really grieve? Is it the grieving father who wants to find horror in everything just to cope? Or is it the grieving mother who has turned to a specific religion to help her understand life and death?As the tension mounts and conversation topics become darker and harder to avoid, Will's becomes increasingly paranoid. Both he and Eden are looking for answers to their son's death and perhaps they could be found if they weren't too busy with one trying to blame the other and one doing all they can to forget. The director does a stellar job in maintaining a mundane and banal tone to the first half of the film. These people are dull but their situation has forced them to be. As the evening continues, though, the sense of screws turning, pennies dropping and clothes shedding becomes palpable. People are not who they seem and it's difficult to tell who is being honest with their intentions and who isn't just plain crazy.The movie builds to a dazzling final act that is satisfyingly violent. Not only that but it offers a devastating look at grief and how easily those grieving can be manipulated.So when we started watching, my brother was complaining about the banality of the conversations. The lack of anything compelling. As the story continued, he began to quieten down. When it finished, he told me, two days later, that he couldn't stop thinking about it. Such was the impact that a story steeped in humanity gone awry had had on him. And myself, for that matter. I'd recommend it. EVeryone is talking about Get Out right now but The Invitation was there first. Go on, accept the invitation."

The reactions are very positive, encouraging, and most of them promise some kind of a twist and overall an intriguing and engaging film. It's not any of those things.

",0.2247,-0.993,2017-10-09 00:00:00,8,"PROS: I love the ending of this film. Everything else is questionable, but the climax and falling action is what makes this film reputable. That sort of aha moment the characters have changes the course of the movie forever. You get a weight laid on you and you go from calm and inactive to white knuckle and at the edge of your seat. This change happens so fast it shocks you and throws you out of this world. I think the devices the director uses to convey this transformation is astounding. Light, sound, setting, acting. It all changed so quickly and you got into an awe that is so horror. This is a psychological horror and granted it deserves it, because it really screwed with my mind. Psychological horror movies are hard to watch because most of the time they are either too scary or not scary enough, and there isn't that balance, but this movie was able to keep this in that psychological category of horror.CONS: This movie is so slow. You sit there watching the screen roll by and you just yawn and move to the next seen. Granted the director tries to add slight hints of fear, but it just doesn't work. And when I say boring, I mean boring. They take literally an hour until they even start to use the character development they built over the time period. I felt that the acting got bruised because of this because of how slow the movie was, because at the end the movie really picks up and so does the acting, but when the movie wasn't intense the acting wasn't good. www.chorror.com"

Especially I would put emphasis on Logan Marshall-Green and John Carroll Lynch, good job. Second, music completely fits the movie, creepy, it further intensifies the element of uncertainty, make you feel something crazy is about to happen.

So madam would like a reversal of the moral test, for satisfying an egocentric need for an after life on her own terms??? Why not!It is showing that in the permissive society, where egos shape their own virtues without reference to anything else, then mass murder can be justified on the basis of ""well, why not?"" --- and hence that is as superficial as it needs to be in this superficial age of ours.A genuine surprise with many strong performances.

I had not seen any trailers of the sort because I didn't want to preview parts that may spoil he movie. With that said, I'm so glad I watched this film. This ranks with Green Room as a real edge-of-your-seat kind of movie but for entirely different reasons. While Green Room is just a unhinged speed chase offroad in complete darkness, leaving you dizzy with blurting holy sh't every 10 seconds, The Invitation takes it's time while not letting the story flatline. The use of ominous shots and reverberating violins really give you that sense of unease.The buildup, the paranoia, the character-structuring, the heavy atmosphere all build up to a short and worthy second half of the film.Honestly, it's frustrating to see so many people give this movie a criminally low rating because 'nothing happens'? Was I watching the same movie? Because what I saw building up to the climax was some of the most gorgeous shots with very grounded characters that immersed me into the story. People react to a movie that they were expecting and it wasn't, so they rate it a 1. Really? This is a quality thriller that I recommend everyone check out."

Very cliché film, one that the director probably showed his family on Halloween and only the dog liked it. The buildup lasts for about 85% of the film and then a small action sequence(one of the worst and most predictable yet) with an ending that YOU WILL PREDICT WITHIN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES. No joke, this movie had such pointless scenes that just drove on without any end in sight. I mean in the beginning they run over a damn coyote and , *spoiler* it literally had no meaning whatsoever.

The conclusion is slapdash, 15 minutes and from the supposedly ""big"" revelation it's all done.And I will spare you a commentary on the last 30 seconds, the worst possible cherry on top.So, conclusion: this film lacks substance in every single aspect: story, developing of the story, characters, acting, catch on the spectator. There's also a couple of plot holes, or anyway ""unfinished"" situations. What exactly happened to the boy? We learn he died, but no circumstance is given on the various flashbacks, they just stop and end one moment before the event.

" Different and impressive, profound acting by supporting cast!
",0.7574,-0.9735,2017-06-06 00:00:00,7,"Usually, I find it more difficult to fully connect to realistic Horror scenarios. Not to say I don't appreciate a good Slasher, Cat & Mouse or a well made Torture Porn with an actual story, plot and preferably a smart twist - but I always enjoy supernatural Horror and Ghost Stories more. Still, I believe one really needs to make a conscious effort in order to fail to recognize the relative greatness of The Invitation.The first thing that hits you is the conflicted music of the soundtrack, ominous yet relaxing, beautiful yet creepy and uneasy, and absolutely suitable to the overall ambiance of the film's occurrences. The music is only the first out of many things that cause and unnerving and uneasy sensation that ""nothing is wrong... yet"". I'm not sure which song this is in the detailed soundtrack, but whoever the composer - way to hit the nail right on the head!The story another feature to add to the uneasy feeling, as Will (Logan Marshall-Green) and his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) are on their way to a gathering of old friends, with the common ground being the untimely tragic loss of a child. The hosts are Will's ex-wife and her new husband, whom she met in a support group for bereaved parents. Eden (Tammy Blanchard), the ex-wife, is surprisingly happy and calm, in a way that bluntly contradicts Will's depression, paranoia and overall neurotics. Having mentioned some of the cast, allow me to say I was very impressed with the acting, especially the facial features and body language. While Marshall-Green is a very convincing paranoid grieving man and Blanchard an equally convincing griever turned slightly crazy, I was impressed the most with Lindsay Burdge as Sadie (sexy and promiscuous) and John Carroll Lynch as Pruitt (silent, violent and deadly), both able to portray their feature characteristics with nothing but a look. Honestly, I've added one point to my rating because of how awe-inspiring these two's acting was. The emphasized features of the film are the tense suspense, building up slowly and almost agonizingly from the start all the way to the final part, and the obscurity regarding Will's fears which keep you guessing all the way to the end. Every time a surprising occurrence or development supports Will's paranoia, another follows up to contradict it. There is simply no way to know, which serves to amplify the suspense and uneasiness. Director Karyn Kusama and screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi have definitely done their job.In the end, what truly gets under your skin is how realistic the depicted scenarios are. Nothing supernatural, nothing remotely unreal, just situations anyone could find themselves in, hence the compelling reason to feel afraid. In addition, I always love seeing more modern characters, like an interracial couple and a gay couple (which I very rarely see in Horror). It's okay to show it on screen, you know, welcome to 2017.All in all, I didn't expect the film to run and end the way it did. The pace is slower than my usual preference, and the feelings evoked are less in the line of ""fear"", and more ""discomfort"", ""uneasiness"" and ""danger"". Still, I very much appreciate the experience I went through while watching, and while I'll probably not watch it again - I'll be sure to recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different in the field of Horror."

",0.0,0.9925,2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"'The Invitation' holds good for most part thanks to some great performances, crafty direction by Karyn Kusama (Aeonflux, Jennifer's Body, Girlfight) and effective screenplay & dialogues by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (who have co-written strictly mediocre films such as The Tuxedo, Clash of the Titans and RIPD).Logan Marshall Green is terrific as Will, and he sort-of exudes that Tom Hardy-esque persona at times. The rest of the cast pitch in with above-par performances as well.It begins like this. Will and his new girlfriend Kira get invited to his old house where his ex-wife Eden and her new husband David are holding a re-union dinner party for their friends. It is implied that Will and Eden lost their son Ty and they divorced soon after. Apparently, Eden met David at a grief support camp. So, the stage is set for an evening of wine and merry-making by the couple who have been off the grid for nearly two years.Will spends a good portion of the evening keeping to himself and recollecting some of the events that took place in his life. Some of those sad memories such as Eden trying to attempt suicide keep bouncing off his head. We are told that one of the characters (Choi) is yet to make it to the party. As the night progresses, Eden and David tell the group about how they have recovered from grief, and found positivity by being part of the cult in Mexico. Things start looking increasingly interesting and the tensive build-up is executed amazingly well. The dialogues appear on-point and hit the mark pretty good.We do get the feeling that something is amiss with the newly- reformed Eden, David and his friend Pruitt. The semi-nude entry of Sadie itself seals the deal with respect to this fact. But everything kinda goes well for a good part of the evening where Will seemingly tries to reconnect with all that has passed. The thrills are deftly placed, and the performances almost perfectly complement the writing and direction. When Will receives a message from Choi stating he had already reached before everyone else but seems M.I.A, the suspicion starts to reach saturation point. The viewer is ready to embrace ""break-point"". Hey, we are at the 75 minute mark here. So that's enough hype. Time for some gory action.The ""break-point"" however arrives a little later than expected, but at a very crucial juncture. I expected a 'Youre Next' sortof 20 minutes to follow, but the pacing never elevates. This is where one feels the writing could have been improved. It lacks those edge-of- the-seat moments that we look for, in thrillers such as these. Slowly yet steadily, we come to the finale which is rather unsurprising too. Fatalities involve good guys and bad guys. The closing shot (that of the burning lanterns) was a redeemer of sorts though.Kusama and her writers needed to put in a little more elucidation as to why the couple and Pruitt waited for so long to commence 'Operation: Murder', given the fact that most of the executions were simply by way of gunshots or straight-forward knife stabs in the end. Ostensibly, it was all part of a cult ritual but COME ON! Why isn't the viewer educated about this? They could have used that Will-Sadie scene by the pool to give clearer hints. Okay, maybe the climax and pre-climax portions do possess a realistic touch compared to other home- invasion thrillers and succeed, to an extent, in maintaining a decent level of ambiguity; nevertheless it brought to a standstill all that bustling excitement which the makers took so long to construct. Them mind- games never really paid off.But hey, hats off to Kusama and crew for concocting an intense and taut psychological thriller that raised the bar in terms of build- up. If only the final bits were charted out better..SIGH!"
" Talking about a pretentious movie... well this is one
",0.2732,0.1037,2017-06-04 00:00:00,4,"I watched this movie together with a friend and unfortunately he wanted to see it until the end. Otherwise I would have stopped it after 20 minutes, as I already knew by then that this movie was not convincing me. Even the first Aliens movie is more believable than this one.* Contains some spoilers *The opening scene with the car running over a coyote - and then the driver killing it because it suffered from pain – was promising. However, the intention of the scene is not exploited, i.e. escape from earthly pains by dying, which is the theme of the movie. - The reunion inside the villa is much more boring (to watch) than the average reunion you ever went to. The atmosphere was meant to be awkward, but in fact it was just dull to look at. Nothing happened for more than an hour. This is not the psychological thriller it's trying to be. - The last 20 minutes, when finally the action starts, I got so much disconnected from all characters that I couldn't care less who would survive or who would go to (their) heaven. - Even the finale of the movie (we're not alone in this situation) was predictable and doesn't make up for the rest of the movie.Bottomline: the idea behind the movie sounded probably OK when it was explained in 3 minutes to a producer, but its implementation failed in many aspects. If you find this a good movie then I advise you to watch some good movies first..."

It would have been better yet had they kept it the same length but concentrated more on character development. At no time did I feel connected to any of the people portrayed, which only made the movie drag out even more. The acting itself was good. Not great, but good. The best part about the movie was the last 10-15 minutes. But alas, after being bored for most of the movie leading up to it it was rendered anti-climatic. Not one I would recommend to a friend."

" If You Hear Cult, Run: The Invitation
",0.0,0.9091,2017-05-11 00:00:00,8,"At the suggestion of a friend, I checked this movie out a few days ago, and what a great suggestion it was. Holy sh*t. It was intense. I kid you not from the very first scene I was uncomfortable, nervous and sweating. Although that probably has more to do with my over-productive sweat gland. My own bodily functions aside, this movie is fantastic. The premise is simple enough. A group of old friends reunite after two years for a dinner party in the hills outside LA. These friends suffered a falling out after a tragedy befell two of them, a couple Will, played by a guy trying his best to look like Vigo Mortensen, and his ex-wife Eden, played by some creepy psycho lady. Returning to the place of the tragedy, his Eden's old house, Will brings a new girlfriend to the dinner party. The party consists of half a dozen or so couples. Eden is living in the old house and married a second husband, named David. He is played by the recast Dario Naharis, and sorry to Game of Thrones book hardos he still doesn't have a yellow mustache nor does he rock a blue beard.Two mysterious friends of David's join the old group of friends. Pruitt, played by that fat bald-middle aged actor your 100% going to recognize but won't be able to name, and Sadie, the very definition of don't stick your dick in crazy, even though she's gorgeous enough to make you think twice and decide its totally worth it how bad could it be, then you end up with a broken computer and frozen chicken all over the floor, true story. The group comes together for dinner and drinks with some laughs, mostly coming from a really funny fat guy (only naturally, we all have one of those), some tears, and a ton of tense, thrilling scenes.Eden and David recently returned from a long trip to Mexico where they joined a cult. Hoping to deal with their dark pasts and personal demons, they accepted 'the invitation'. Now if you aren't terrified of the word cult already, then you are probably in a cult. Because those things are f**king creepy as sh*t. I don't care what anyone says I'm not drinking your damn Kool-Aid®. My own personal fears of cults aside, this movie will have you holding your seat till your knuckles are whiter than that one time your dad tried to rap along to Kanye.What I love most about this movie however, is how it plays with conventions and tropes of horror movies. For those who watch a lot of horror movies, the conventions and tropes of horror are easy to see coming. This movie cleverly sets up all of the basic scares and 'twists' that I've come to expect. But it went in a completely different direction than I expected at every turn. It got to the point where I genuinely did not know what was going to happen next. I started doubting who was the protagonist, what was logical and what was happening. It was almost as if one character knew he was in a horror movie and kept looking for classical horror movie tropes, but the movie was doing its best convincing us it wasn't a horror movie, which weirdly made it even scarier.From the beginning to the very end, there were twists, scares, and more tension than my body knew how to process. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. And if you are someone who is sick of crappy horror movies and wants to see something original, clever, and different I cannot recommend this enough. It is on Netflix® right now so you have no excuse not to watch it tonight. Screw that exam that determines your whole future. And if you don't have Netflix® get your life together. Get it or ask someone who has it to borrow it. If you don't have friends I don't know man buy a cat or something."

" A Golden Opportunity Missed
",0.1531,-0.9792,2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"The Invitation had one of the most tense build ups I have ever witnessed on screen. I actually was biting my nails in suspense, so sharp you could cut it with a knife. Unfortunately, it ended up being all foreplay and no climax as we waited nearly the entire film to end with no true emotional satisfaction or feeling of awe.The build up was golden, the low woodwind instruments gave you a pit in your throat knowing something was really wrong, and the dramatic irony almost of us knowing our protagonist is right but not knowing when it will be revealed was truly having me on the edge of my seat. However, when it actually came down to business, we didn't really get much of a pay off. Yes we find out it was supposed to be a ritual suicide but the story without emotional content made it almost hard to let go. I found myself begging for answers that we just didn't get, and not in a clever holding back way. For example, what the heck happened to Claire? We never even find out why she was doing this? Okay yes, take the pain away, but she literally says ""I almost let it kill me"" about the loss of her son, but now shes gonna kill herself? Something doesn't add up. And above all why the does he bring her out to the yard so she can die peacefully where she wants to? Hello, she just murdered most of your friend group and you don't even demand answers or feel a deep anger towards her? If anything I thought it would come back to the mercy killing with the fox, great set up and bad missed opportunity there.I gotta say I was laughing at the end with the black girl (they totally just threw in there not to have a whitewashed movie) just had to be thinking ""this is why i'm never going to a dinner party with crazy ass white people ever again"" Overall, I probably would recommend someone to watch it, with the disclaimer that they aren't going to leave with any satisfaction from it. It entertains, it tenses, but it does not deliver. Straight to DVD, without the score not even sure if that. I would say it could have done a lot of good with an extra half hour to balance out tension & action instead of a not boring, but slow, build up with a very fast climax. That being said, had the ending been different and they delivered on the tension they built up we could have had a very different review."
" a dramatic thriller, more than a horror, with substance and raw emotion
",-0.5542,0.986,2017-04-14 00:00:00,7,"The Invitation gives Karyn Kusama, from a script by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, a chance to come back to movies after a number of years away in the Genre Film Uncertainty. You know what that is, when a director gets sucked up into Hollywood and does some films for any number of reasons and comes out of it almost scathed (I haven't seen Aeon Flux, but Jennifer's Body was fairly weak tea). I think the strength for her here is that she has a lot to play with, almost like a theater director but with a damn fantastic cinematographer (seriously, Bobby Shore, pointing you out for good work), and it's about the tension that's about to pop that all she has to do is make sure the cast clicks well together. She's also wise to cast people who we may have seen before in some TV and character parts - Michiel Huisman and Logan Marshall Green, for example, have various recurring TV roles, and John Carrol Lynch is the one guy that will always stand out for Zodiac - but aren't household names (originally Zachary Quinto and Topher Grace were attached).By scaling it back a little, it has a true independent film feeling while at the same time the production quality is top notch as far as, again, the camera-work and all of her directions to Marshall Green as Will, who has to carry a lot of the suspicion and heavy dramatic feeling here. In a sense the first two thirds of this may throw off those thinking this is straight horror; it's creepy, and it's awkward (kind of like one of those cringe comedies but played deadly straight really, if one laughs it's out of temporary awkwardness), and it's really an examination of full-bodied grief. What happens when one has to face that every day? Does it get any easier? Can anyone let go of all of those horrible emotions? The 'game' of the title of the film, which one might think has some BS connotations about inner peace and, at worst, fooling oneself is.... well, you'll just have to watch, won't you? The last third of the film ends up becoming, frankly, what one might expect, and I wished the filmmakers could have gone in a slightly different direction - what if one kept up the dramatic feeling about this, for example - but that's also what's smart about the direction of the script. The uncertainty could go either way about how Will is reacting to this situation - is it cult or not (and in odd timing, seeing this not too long after the 40th anniversary of the Jonestown massacre, that was on my mind as well) - and while it ends up going in the way I thought (both in how it unfolds, the big OH S*** turning point, and who is who in the final stretch so to speak), it's handed with the same level of tautness and raw feeling that went into the rest of the picture.And then.... the very end, like the last minute, makes me take a full half a star off - it completely kills what should have been an easy enough way to end this story by shoving an unbelievable ""OMG Look what ELSE is going on!"" beat that is completely false and unrealistic (at least considering the realistic world that this is being staged in). Until then, this is a tense and taut and completely uncomfortable drama that dovetails into conventional horror in the last third, though not in a bad way. It shows that Blumhouse doesn't have a lockdown on single-location thrillers, and with substance no less (to give it a higher compliment, if Ingmar Bergman was somehow during the time of Jason Blum and wanted to quickly do something in between projects, he might've put out something like this... up to a point)."

What else would you want from a movie? Oh yes, I almost forgot, that beautiful, beautiful background score! Its so well mixed with everything that its still haunting me. This movie thinks you - yes! you, the person who is watching it - are smart. It doesn't depend on character's stupidity or jerk scenes to evoke the chill. Its that brilliant!Although there about a dozen characters in the movies, the story is told from one person's POV. So it chills you when things begin to unravel.Just beautiful.

" Avoid.

I do give credit when it's deserved and say that the acting in the movie was well played by all but unfortunately the script and direction of it failed the movie.It did do well in creating an awkward dinner party in what was wanted by the director and I personally enjoyed the notation of the game 'I want' but that's where the likes stopped.An hour and forty minutes of what is said to be a thriller, drama and mystery where I perceived the movie to be a suspenseful drama that wasted my time and the only mystery was how this movie scored a 6.7. The movie is set in a house where friends reunite after not seeing each other for two years. There's no depth in it's story line nor does it deliver something we haven't seen in other colt related movies. When it does come to a climax it lets its audience down by not delivering When finally everything is unraveled its not awe you're in but rather 'that's it'? After watching this movie I instantly thought of the 1995 movie 'The last Supper', which it slightly imitated. This movie had potential but simply did not deliver. If it was planning to be a thriller, drama or mystery, simply chose one and do it well."

There are some serious themes about grief and the different ways in which people deal with it thrown in to give the film some ballast, but it's mostly interested in ratcheting up the tension, which it does admirably.The viewer goes into a movie like this knowing that there's going to be some kind of twist ending, and the one in this delivers the goods.Grade: A-"
" A thriller for people who don't watch horror films
",0.5264,-0.956,2017-03-14 00:00:00,9,"I'm not going to give a review of this film. I'll leave that to others who can argue whether it was worth watch or not. For me, I feel it was one of the best thrillers with a horror bent that I have seen in a long while. But here's the thing, I don't really like horror films, avoid them most of the time, unless I heard a good word of mouth from someone. That's how I found The Invitation.After reading the reviews here, I would say the criticism falls in to two opposing camps. Those that thought it was thrilling, terrifying and well done movie and those who thought it was a waste of their time, slow and they saw all the punches coming.I think the difference is this, the latter camp watches a lot of horror films, nothing surprises them, they are looking for all the little nuances of all the other horror movies they have watched and are comparing them to the film they are currently watching. They are two - three steps ahead of a conventional audience and thus, nothing surprises them. To these folks, I can understand why the film fell flat, it's clear if you put the movie under a microscope you can tell what's going to happen and naturally with the purposefully drawn out pace of this film, they get bored waiting for the payoff.I, as well as the people who I have give / shown this film to, fall in to the other camp. We rarely watch films like this and therefore are willing to let it all play out without trying the guess what's going to happen next. It's certainly a creepy film and while we might imagine where it's going, we are willing to suspend our expectations and go along for the ride.My advice, watch this if you enjoy the ride up on the climbing roller coaster without thinking about the plunge when you reach the top."
" A hidden gem within the horrid land of Netflix horror movies
",-0.802,0.9676,2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"""The Invitation"" definitely did a lot of things well versus the typical horror movie on Netflix or even just within the genre itself comparing to ""Hollywood"" horror movies released in theaters.I was especially fond of the mystery that lasted throughout the entire film. It was honestly scene after scene where I found myself wondering wtf was going on. On top of the mystery feel of the film, I especially appreciate films that make it seem like the ""good guy"" may not actually be the good guy. A film that can do that well often splits its audience in two until the reveal finally hits if a certain person or party is the villain of a film.However, although I enjoyed the film, I was a bit bothered by some plot points and lack of common sense (that we all too often witness in these kinds of horror/thrillers). Certain points were clearly missed in regards to being explained and some were simply just holes, never to be visited again. Another thing I was not fond of what the characters beyond the three main ones. Everyone else was pointless and simply a part of the herd to slaughter. No development, no point, just meatshields for the movie.But otherwise, definitely not a terrible flick. I enjoyed it much more than I anticipated.-- Oberrated.com --"

" A slow burning gem
",0.0,-0.9656,2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Oh, this was a freaking gem. I'm always psyched to explore woman-directed horror and thriller movies, and Karyn Kusama — with her fourth full-length film — is fantastic at keeping the tension taut and the suspicion simmering.Will (the intense Logan Marshall-Green, a dead ringer for a more emotionally scarred Tom Hardy) is driving along the Hollywood hills with his girlfriend, Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi), on their way to a dinner party. The weird vibes are established early on — and with shocking delivery — when they hit a coyote and Will is finding himself having to put the poor animal out of its misery with a tire iron found in the trunk. They arrive, albeit a bit shaken, at the party, which takes place in Will's former home and is hosted by his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new husband, David (Michiel Huisman). The motivation for the party is unclear at first, and all involved seem a bit confused but optimistic (aside from Will, who is on guard from the second he walks in), until there begins to be talk of a cult-like group in Mexico and a bizarre video that almost feels like a call for recruitment. The group deals with grief, something that Eden and Will share deeply as we learn in various flashbacks that show their son dying in an accident right before their eyes. The dinner continues to be vaguely bizarre until an AWESOME surprise ending.Firstly, the feeling of dread and almost suffocation is palpable. It's brilliant, especially since it starts within the first minute of the movie, before anything has even begun to go wrong. You just immediately feel like you want to get the hell out of that house, and you're eyeballing everyone with intense suspicion.The cinematography is wonderfully done by Bobby Shore (furiously scanning his IMDb page to see what else of his I can watch). The entire movie feels decadent and sparkling despite this mystery simmering beneath the surface, and the scenes where they flash back to the son's death are haunting, especially the one where Will is in his son's old room and imagines laying face to face on the bed with him, both breaking into smiles heartbreaking doesn't even begin to cover it. There's a few standout scenes in particular — Will in the bathroom with the mirrors seemingly in a state of neverending reflection, and the group moving to the upper floor with the camera focused on their feet ascending the stairs perfect.When Will rejoins the party after hearing Choi's chilling voicemail, the music is almost like a swarm of bees it's perfect. There's just so many small, understated moments that make this movie stand out to me.You know Will is right to suspect something bizarre happening, and to be frustrated as hell by Eden and David's overbearing eccentricity and fluffy talk about letting go of useless emotions, and yet the awkwardness and anxiety you feel when he finally starts to openly freak out is very real but so deserved, because for much of the movie you're reminded of our society's bullshit willingness to suspend our real emotions in favor of being accepted or polite.It's this slow burn of tension for a majority of the movie until the last 20 minutes or so, which will make you grip whatever's closest to you as you watch in disbelief. I won't totally spoil it for you — trust me, I thought about it — but it's good. It's action packed and intense and disturbingly realistic and still a bit heartbreaking and the ending was just A+. Really great all around, and this makes me even more excited to finally see XX (a horror anthology that was released this month which has a short film directed by Kasuma in it)."

The first half has some nice tension but it's a little slow for me. There is a good reversal in the middle. The last half is good but it's not as intense as I like. This is all nicely made.

",-0.6219,0.9909,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"It's very difficult to assign a genre/film category to 'The Invitation'. Is it a hardcore drama? I think so. Is it a psychological thriller? Most certainly as it revels in its atmosphere of dread. Is it a horror film? From a certain angle, yes as there are moments of exploitation and gore which horror film fans will be familiar with. From a personal standpoint, my favourite horror/thrillers are the ones that work on a thematic as well as a generic level and 'The Invitation' is a prime example of a film that achieves success in that regard. I have to shower admiration on the screenplay written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. The script uses the central character of Will to give us a very poignant and sensitive exploration of grief and the struggles which come along in the process of dealing with it. Many films attempt to show us characters dealing with grief, but on many occasions, they can be underwhelming due to the lack of sophistication. 'The Invitation' offers us a very mature depiction of how it can be like to live with grief. The character remains somewhat aloof throughout the party. He has become a loner and seems uncomfortable for having to spend a whole evening in the house where he once used to stay with his family and where he had to experience the most painful event of his life. He wants to move on, but can't get rid of his self created guilt. He views Eden's elaborate attempts of joining a spiritual cult to get over the past as an act of denial. On one hand Will wants to move on, but on the other he thinks that ignoring what happened is a sign of betrayal to the spirit of his dead son. He is constantly fighting with himself. On a thematic level, the film is saying that grief is personal and the process of recovery is also personal. Your friends and loved ones can support you through the process, but in the end, it is you and only you who can get through it. As the last shot of the film shows, Kira can support Will, but she will never be able to force his recovery or act as a cataylst in his process of rehabilitation. The film takes a cynical stance on the communal nature of dealing with griefs through groups and cults. Forcing the process of rehabilitation as Eden and David attempt to do in the film doesn't serve any purpose.Karyn Kusama very effectively creates a claustrophobic atmosphere inside the house. She conjures up a tone drenched in paranoia. The film is shown pretty much from the point of view of Will. The editing and the transition from one scene to the next is at times a bit intentionally abrupt to put the doubt in the viewer's mind about whether Will's POV is reliable or not as we all know how distressed and paranoid he is. The film is shot well. The visual colour texture of the film shifts from the orange-ish hue of the scenes in the party to a bluish tinge in the flashback scenes. The camera isn't doing anything too radical, but there are two shots of Will's reflection on the mirror in two separate scenes (the first one involving him and David with the mirror in between them and the second one involving Will alone as we see two lines of multiple reflections on the mirror) that really impressed me. These two shots visually capture in an artistic sense, Will's fragmented psyche and his inner dilemmas. The acting is good from everyone involved, but I will give a special mention to Logan Marshall-Green and Tammy Blanchard. Green not only looks like Tom Hardy, but also has that charismatic masculine aura about him that one associates with Hardy. He remains stoic for the most part, but then peppers in moments of genuine vulnerability and brilliantly sells the inner turmoil and guilt that Will is going through. Blanchard plays the Hitchcock-ian mystery woman. She always looks mysterious and artificial and we get subtle hints from time to time of the darkness simmering underneath the smile.'The Invitation' is a brilliant work that succeeds as a suspenseful thriller as well as a mature exploration of grief and its accompanying dilemmas. The direction, writing and acting are pretty much perfect all over the board."
" Good but not Great.
",-0.5409,0.9757,2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"This movie is certainly underrated (though only a bit ). It starts of very well, giving the audience the chills with its eerie soundtrack. This is only heightened as the movie progresses. The movie surely captivates you and makes you quite unsure of what to think. They lead you into believing something is about to happen but keep prolonging it. This undeniably helps with the suspense. The characters are very mysterious and spooky which is perfect for the tone of the movie. Especially the lead, he kills it. There is also an emotional aspect of the film that I feel they didn't use or portray in the best way. It tends to be overlooked and is completely run over by the suspense. As for the suspense itself, they build it very well right up to the end, but finish in a hurried manner (I was like is this all? )In the end it is undoubtedly an edge of the seat thriller, but when you think of it you feel like you've seen several movies which are similar."
" Not worth seeing
",-0.1695,-0.9983,2017-01-21 00:00:00,3,"Just read jared-andrews2357's review he says it all. One could see this m movie as a critique to cults in general, but if so, it was done really poorly.. In general a very predictable and irritating movie, that's trying to be deeper than it really is and fails to deliver in all aspects. There are things happening all around our guests, but no one seems to notice except from our protagonist who is in grief. All the other ""normal"" guests are the stupidest people that could exist.*spoilers*Most suicide cults ask for consent. It is still a sick and criminal thing to do. Here we have no consent but only 4 people who want to die and decide to take their friends with them. We have no other explanation than ""we went to Mexico and met this Dr. something and he showed us the way out of our grief. We get no retort from the people who want to live. No judgment. They actually help the grieving mother who decided to kill them all gladly to fulfill her last will and ""go outside"" without any hesitation. Seriously? All of them? Even Kira who just met her that day and almost died because of her? People react so purely and unrealistically in this movie, except from the first woman who just left (most of us would have had either that reaction, or would have prepared ourselves for at least an orgy after that ""game""). The only reaction that Prouit gets after saying that he killed his wife (and only got 5 or 7 years of prison for some reason, though that just might be USA's legal system I have no idea) is a ""what the f@ck"". The only thing you can actually sympathize with in this movie is Wills reaction when he starts yelling at everyone that ""this doesn't feel safe"". Lastly, why in the end they show that this was an all around town phenomenon? They supposedly all met in Mexico and created the cult. Did all of them live in L.A or was this a national wide phenomenon? Why show it just to impress us and not give us answers? This is the most irritating thing about this movie, it's constantly presenting us things that make no sense and doesn't even try to justify them. It goes from ""Pain is a chemical reaction which can be controlled and ignored"" to ""I' ll just kill all my friends (for no apparent reason) and myself"" without any steps in between. This is actually pretty insulting to grieving people who struggle, even to people with attempted suicides, but that's beside the point. *end of spoilers*Long story sort, don't watch this movie it will just irritate you if you 're looking for anything that makes sense or provides you with food for thought."
" Would recommend!
",0.4199,0.9199,2017-01-18 00:00:00,7,"After looking for a horror to watch, I came across The Invitation. Firstly, it's not a horror but more of a mystery/thriller, so if you are looking for lots of jump scares and gore then don't watch this movie.I was hooked from the beginning and not just because of Tom Hardy doppelganger Logan Marshall-Green. A story about a reunion dinner party taking place between friends, with some iffy guests and odd party games, the question is.. Is Will paranoid? What are the motives of the hosts? While not much actually happens in the first 1 hour 15 mins, there is a sense foreboding maintained throughout, with the palpable tension of the lead character, eerie lighting, blurred camera effects and flashbacks. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat.As other reviews have said, some of the best moments were between the two lead males, LMG and Game of Thrones actor Michiel Huisman. It is almost as if they are fighting for the role of alpha-male. A side note to that - they are both gorgeous and while this is slightly irrelevant, it made the movie just that little bit more enjoyable. I gave it a slightly lower score because although it added to the effectiveness of the movie, the build up to the climax was a little bit too lengthy and the climax itself was mildly disappointing. Would recommend!"
" Spoiler Alert: This is the Worst Movie of all Time..
",-0.4404,-0.9814,2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a big, steaming pile of crap. I mean there's literally nothing else I could say to describe how bad it is. The Invitation is hands down the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of watching.The best part of the movie is when the end credits start rolling.Unfortunately I have to write 10 Lines about this movie when it can be summed up with one word: Godawful.As Charles Barkley would say ""This movie is turrible""This movie was like my prom date, got me all worked up but there was no big payoff at the end of the night When I'm lying on my death bed, my only regret will be that I wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my life watching this dumpster fire of a movie.Anyone associated with the making of this film should retire immediately and solemnly swear they'll never make another movie again. Ever.From the ridiculous plot that moves like a slug covered in salt to the laughable, anticlimactic ending, this movie is a world class dud."
" A smart thriller, deserving of a better payoff.
",0.7184,0.9791,2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"A man and his girlfriend are invited to a dinner party hosted by the man's ex and her new husband. Things don't seem right from the go, as the hosts behaviour seems to get stranger as time goes by and more details emerge of the two ex's trouble past. At the party are a number of other guests, none of which are particularly likable or interesting, but the film does an effective job in ramping up the tension. Unfortunately, I found the payoff pretty disappointing, but the build up towards it is smart and effective. The lead, Logan Marshall-Green, who I only remember from Prometheus (where he was shocking), is actually pretty good here, the rest of the cast are forgettable. Not the worst way to spend an hour and forty minutes, would recommend."
" IMDb ratings really wrong on this one!
",-0.5697,-0.8823,2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"Yes,awful! Pretentious attempt with the writing to appear sophisticated yet it was annoying within 15 minutes. The flash backs and music...ugh! The last 15 minutes just made me angry that I wasted my evening watching this because IMDb had a rating of 6.7. IMDb ratings are usually right on target but this must have been a scam of abusers submitting bogus stats.If you watch this then review all the goofs to make sure they are accurate. I don't want to waste my time and even review it myself but there are a ton of them goofs especially with the locked doors....so easy to get out of the house in the end.....movie sucked!"
" Intense But Nothing New
",0.0387,0.8402,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Another in a series of cult-minded horror movies that have been enjoying a renaissance of sorts lately. A dinner party in the Hollywood Hills, between old friends, and an ex-couple with a dead son whom they both grieve in their own ways (ostensibly leading to their divorce). What happens is an exploration of those classic themes, grief and acceptance, with a a modern twist. Characters are well-drawn, the acting is good to great all around, and there's genuine suspense. What's missing is surprise or newness. With this kind of story it's easy to guess where it's going, and while the ride there is fun and well crafted, it still has that common destination. There's an almost twist at the end, that plays like one, but in reality is nothing but a coda for things to come, and quickly, after that."
" ""You're Invited""
",0.0,0.8982,2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"What would you do when your friends invite you over to their house and things start to get really weird, almost uncomfortably unsafe weird. You get the hell out right? Despite the one characters constant questioning of events that take place here, he doesn't seem interested in leaving the party. If he does, we don't have a film anymore. So putting aside logic and accepting that only one person decides to leave this party, is The Invitation thrilling enough to warrant a recommended watch?Will takes his new girlfriend to his ex-wife's house for a dinner party. All their friends are there, friends they haven't seen in awhile. Things between Will and his ex-wife is a little strained due to an emotional loss in their past, but everyone decides to look past it in order to have a good time. Throughout the night, Will suspects that his ex-wife and her new husband have other motives for bringing everyone together. Are there other motives? Or is Will just crazy? The film lets the questionable actions of the hosts walk a fine line to make you lean either way. The hosts invite another guest that their friends do not know. This is someone they met in a grief group known as The Invitation. This guy seems a little off, but is pleasant enough on the outside to not really question anything. It's not until he gives a speech about his wife do people really feel uncomfortable and question if they should stay. The Invitation does a decent job of keeping an awkward level of suspense within the house, even if you are questioning character actions. A key element to this film is the opening sequence when Will and his new girlfriend hit a coyote with their car on their way to the party. The coyote is injured and it's up to Will to put the creature out of its misery. That act is the core theme to the entire film. The film asks us these questions throughout. The film's third act kicks things into high gear and the subtly of the suspense in thrown out the window for a more in your face approach. The entire film builds to this confrontation and it works for the most part. I can't help by feel that the one and only memorable things about this film though is the final shot. Which is a great shot that almost feels Hitchcockian. This single location thriller is effective enough for fans of the genre to enjoy and people looking for a good thriller won't mind it either."
