" Fun and Funny! Great for what it was intended
",0.8908,0.9538,2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"I really liked Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. For what this movie was intended to be, it hit the mark for me. I thought it was hysterical and I laughed throughout. I also think the casting was perfection across the board. It seems comedies have a harder time resonating with large audiences than other genres, but if you are looking for a movie that is light and fun this may be a good one to watch. I have a stable of films I rewatch dependingo on my mood. This is included."
" Some true Rasberry Award performances
",0.743,0.7842,2021-02-24 00:00:00,1,When Zack Efron is the least annoying person in a movie you know you are is serious trouble.Adam Devine is an insufferable narcissistic unfunny untslented piece of trash. I wish they would do a real comedic roast on him where they rag on him so much he cries. And then actually tie him up roast him alive like a pig. Wow....deep breaths.....ok.No ones funny in this. A perverted lesbian is right behind Devine in terms of unlikability. Aubrey Plaza doesn't even look hot in this either.
" Funny as hell.....

i will definetely watch this a 5th time some day"
" Nothing like workaholics or anything in that genre
",-0.2755,0.4338,2021-02-21 00:00:00,2,"The girls are extremely annoying, barely any good jokes (I only liked Adam's part) and I had to cringe multiple times at how bad it just was. If you like workaholics, super bad, pineapple express or anything in that area, than avoid this one cause it's nothing like that."
" It's not an art film, but it's so damn funny!
",-0.1929,0.9308,2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"Is it a technically great film? Of course not. But it had me dying laughing throughout. The 4 leads have hilarious timing. If you go into this expecting something other than a dumb comedy, why would you do that? Just grab some popcorn and enjoy."
" Tries mightily but lacks direction or energy
",0.3919,0.3573,2020-12-04 00:00:00,5,"This is a movie i wanted to like, since it has a number of stars (Zac Efron, Anna Kendrick) whose films I've enjoyed in the past. But it's a movie that's just too hard to watch. The goal of the characters is obvious enough, since it's in the title, and the light-hearted premise would seem ripe for funny situations. Alas, not much of the sort ever seems to make it to the screen. The movie spins its wheels, not knowing where to go or what to do with the premise, and the most obvious thing to exploit - the minor tension implicit with the question ""how will they find their wedding dates?"" and more importantly, how it will all go wrong - is never explored in an entertaining way. There's a surprising lack of any sort of tension about any of the questions inherent in this light comedy...unfortunately, since it is seemingly the sole plot device in the whole movie.This movie misdirects at every opportunity, and wastes the talent its given. It doesn't manage to create any interest in any of the characters, even the two leads. I couldn't find enough interesting about it to keep watching, and that's too bad - the director and screenwriter should have been sent back to film school after this, really second rate effort."
" Dumb and Fun
",0.0,0.9985,2020-11-03 00:00:00,4,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates stars Zac Efron, Adam Devine, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza and is about two hard partying brothers placing an online ad to find dates to their sisters wedding. So Mike and Dave was a comedy that I was sort of anticipating and well... I got what I wanted for the most part, a fun summer movie. Now this is a very simple film, so this'll be a shorter review as I don't have too much to say about this movie. So this is a very predictable story, you can see everything coming from a mile away and the ending is no surprise but what this movie does have going for it is great chemistry among the actors/actresses as well as this film oozes this cartoony nature that may be a turnoff to some people but worked quite well for me. So first off the acting is good, I enjoy all the actors in this film, I just wish they could have been in a film a little more original and funny but I thought they all worked quite well and I totally bought into Adam Devine and Zac Efron being brothers. Also like I was saying before this film is sort of different for the fact that it is not based in reality, this movie really plays out like a cartoon, nothing like the Jump Street movies but still nothing too realistic. A major downside to the film is that this movie feels very generic, like it is trying to play to young kids my age and it doesn't always work out. The film tries to cater a lot of jokes to millennial's, some of them so worn-out and tired, that they aren't even the slightest bit funny. Luckily this movie does feature some jokes that are laugh out loud hilarious and will keep me coming back. That's something I can't really explain about this movie, it isn't anything special, like it'll definitely be a comedy most people will forget but I loved its lighthearted nature and it just made me smile. It's a feel good dumb film that'll I'll definitely be re-watchng from time-to-time, in no way is it a good movie and my rating shouldn't be solely based on my enjoyment. With that being said, Mike and Dave Needs Wedding Dates gets a 4/10."

" Cheap humour ruins it.
",0.0516,0.7906,2020-08-23 00:00:00,4,"The film has a great cast and there was a lot of potential. However, whatever good points it had are ruined by its being riddled with cheap vulgar and coarse humour."

" Humour just about rescues this from soppy romcom territory
",0.6597,0.9969,2020-07-14 00:00:00,7,"A great cast and amusing humour, but man does it take itself too seriously.I think I can just about consider 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' as a good film. The lead stars do respectable jobs and most of the comedy is funny, the fact that it tries to be heartfelt on too many occasions almost derails my feelings towards it though.Zac Efron (Dave), Adam DeVine (Mike), Anna Kendrick (Alice) and Aubrey Plaza (Tatiana) all connect very well together, the chemistry in their respective cliques isn't always there but for the comical stuff they work.Efron and Plaza would be my picks from the onscreen talent, especially Plaza who commits to the role nicely; despite an iffy accent. Elsewhere you have Sam Richardson (Eric), Lavell Crawford (Keith) and Stephen Root (Burt) appearing, they have relatively minor roles though it's cool to see them involved.It's the attempted heartwarming story that lets this down, I guess it does leave with a positive message but none of it comes across in the film itself - I didn't connect with any of the characters on a proper level, Jake Szymanski & Co. should've just went for the 100% pure comedy. Being earnest is OK but you simply have to make it click, it doesn't here.Thankfully, the satisfactory if sometimes hit-and-miss humour just about rescues this from soppy romcom territory."

I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews??! What were you people expecting? If you look at the cast and if you know the type films they usually star in, you would know what to expect. If you haven't seen this movie GO PICK IT UP AND GIVE IT A CHANCE.

" Either you love it or hate it
",0.128,0.7992,2019-12-28 00:00:00,8,Truly one of the best comedian movie out there but not all people get the joke
" Actually Quite Funny
",0.4927,0.9978,2019-12-12 00:00:00,8,"The thing that annoyed me the most about this film was the title. I was in Paris at the time this film had hit the cinemas there, and the title was Hors Controle, which, honestly, probably describes this film so much better (for those who don't know French, it means 'Out of Control'). In a way, that title just suited the film so much better than the one that us English speakers got, and also, it made me want to see the film more so than when it was in the cinemas here in Australia.So, we have Mike and Dave, who love a good party, but the thing is that whenever they are around, the party turns pretty bad, and people end up getting injured. In fact, the opening credits, and then the videos that are shown afterwards, give a pretty clear indication of how these parties actually turn out.Yeah, it is one of those films that has a few drug references (and I have to admit, having people hide marijuana smoking implements as opposed to people just taking ecstasy provides much more laughs, particularly since Hollywood really does seem to go overboard when they portray people on ecstasy), as well as other things that you would expect from such a film.The premise is simple though - their sister is getting married, and the ultimatum is that they have to bring their own dates. Well, that doesn't turn out quite well considering they decide to post an ad on Craigslist, and as such get a heap of people that they realise probably wouldn't go down all that well at the wedding (and as an added catch, the wedding is in Hawaii). However, a couple of girls realise that they can get a free vacation, and set in motion a plan to get invited along. Not surprisingly, these girls, and Mike and Dave, just seem to be so much the same.Yeah, I found this film to be pretty funny, though another big problem is that there were a number of scenes cut, and a number of scenes that had references to those scenes (such as the apple, and the spit roast pig). Honestly, I found that to be rather disappointing that these scenes were actually cut, because it would have made the film so much better. Then again, maybe, just maybe, an uncut version will be available down the track.Still, though, this is definitely a fun film, especially if you like these types of films, and I have to be honest that I did actually find it rather amusing in places. It was all round good fun."
" This movie is funny
",0.4404,0.9245,2019-12-05 00:00:00,8,I am a big fan of Zac Efron since High School Musical and love all his movies and this movie is good and really funny but some rude bits but that's my sense of humour probably because I like Keith Lemon lol

",0.6688,0.9084,2019-09-15 00:00:00,10,I watched Mike and Dave simply because it stared Zac Efron (I would watch Zac Efron sit and stare at the screen for two hours and be entertained because he is so amazing) ...yet to my surprise the main reason I loved this movie was because of Adam. I actually found Adam to be absolutely hilarious and the chemistry between Adam and Zac was spot on!! I own this on Blu Ray and I still laugh so hard I cry! I would put this movie on my list of one of the funniest comedies of all time!! I am in shock of the bad reviews..but I guess to each is own.

" my notes
",0.0,0.2407,2019-06-30 00:00:00,5,Ok movie. Had lots of funny parts but also lots of unfunny parts. I like Adam Devine from Workaholics but he was just too over the top in this. and the serious part of the movie was cheesy and lots of parts felt very fake and cartoony (1 viewing)
" I like the one on the right!
",0.4199,-0.088,2019-06-24 00:00:00,6,"This is an entertaining-enough entry in the 'wedding comedy' genre - a reference to Wedding Crashers telling you just where they wanted to pitch it. I haven't seen much of Adam DeVine, but you can tell from this that his background is in YouTube comedy rather than acting - his over-the-top mugging is the least funny thing about the film. Other than singing at the end, Anna Kendrick is slightly miscast, but Aubrey Plaza is always fun and - though I'm hardly the target demographic for him - I can't help liking Zac Efron. The guy is funny. It's not just because of his abs that his career goes from strength to strength while DeVine's, comparatively, is stuttering a bit. And why does he give himself a capital V? It's an Irish name, not French or Italian. And it's a pain to type."

It stuck to its guns, it's a slapstick romantic comedy. Good actors playing the roles of a group of idiots, and they played it well. People calling it ""stupid, unrealistic, has a poor plot line"" (which I disagree with, the plot line is solid, also pretty unique in its own way. Meaning I've never heard of a movie with a plot similar to this.) These people don't understand that that's the way the cast/crew intended it to be looked at. The movie was made to make you laugh, and it worked for meAlso Aubrey Plaza is fiiiiiiiiiiiiiine."
" Very funny

afterward. These two goofballs both around 30 are being given an ultimatum
with an invitation to their younger sisters wedding. Bring nice respectable
dates and don't embarrass the family by hitting on all the women there.But two partying women Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza hear a free trip to
Hawaii is in the offing and they maneuver an invitation. And these two like

" Sad tale about a bunch of losers and a wedding
",-0.7579,0.6231,2018-09-25 00:00:00,1,"What more is there to say. This is like 'Jackass, the wedding'. Everyone in this movie plays one of the irritating people that you have to put up with, that by believing they are the most important person in any situation, ruin everything in life. Only here, every single one of them is a jerk instead of just one or two like in real life. Yep, every single character is a jerk. So if your idea of fun is to watch a bunch of self entitled morons not just screw up their own life, but everyone else's as well, this one is for you. What's worse, is it's not even funny. You're better off watching the three stooges, at least you'll get some laughs."

So I'm disappointed as it could've been so much more and one of the greats comedy movies."
" Mostly entertaining except Adam Devine
",0.4404,0.8397,2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Mike and Dave are brothers whose shenanigans always go too far and ruin family events. With their sister's wedding coming up in Hawaii, they are instructed to find dates in the belief that this will curb their antics. And the plan might even have worked had Tatiana and Alice not seen the ad and decided that a Hawaii vacation sounded nice...This modern comedy (and when I say ""modern"" I mean ""non-stop profanity and a preoccupation with sexual matters"") features Zac Efron and Adam Devine as the two brothers, and Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick as the wedding dates, and some attractive Hawaiian locations. It is often also quite funny, and if you're happy with constant profanity and a tendency to revel in sexuality at the gutter end, you're probably going to like this a lot.I enjoyed it, and there were times when it made me laugh quite a bit. And I liked both Efron and Aubrey Plaza: Plaza has mastered an on-screen persona which is attractive without being stunning, and both raunchy and funny at the same time, and she uses that quality well in this. I have reservations with both Anna Kendrick and Adam Devine, though.Kendrick is very talented. She is also a pretty girl with a nice body, and this film demanded that she show some of it. She didn't. She played the Hollywood game of talking a lot about sex but coyly showing a flash of ankle (OK, there is some minor nudity in this movie, including Plaza's *ss, but not much). Miss Kendick wears Big Knickers and I felt cheated.Adam Devine's character, big brother Mike, is a dick. He's meant to be, but it makes him the most annoying character in the film. Unfortunately, Devine is allowed - nay, encouraged - to overplay him, which turned the character (and Devine) into individuals I never wanted to see again. Ever. And this was a shame because I mostly enjoyed the movie."

The story is about two brothers who need to find dates for their little sister's Hawaii wedding and make an ad. The two wild girls pretend to be good girls so they are chosen.And it is hilarious all the way through. I was really laughing out loud through most of it. It is not some super clever comedy but it makes one laugh and this is what I need from this kind of movie. We live in a bit of depressing times so it is nice to see this kind of comedy just to relax and laugh.The characters are all great. Fun people, made me remember the good times of living with my best friend and doing crazy things. And of course the fact that the actors are all talented comedians makes it even better."

Aubrey Plaza is so super hot. Sugar Lyn Beard is so super hot. It's her face! And her personality. Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd her body, wow. SLB gets TFN (totally freaking naked) in M&DNWD. I love that. Anna Kendrick's so super hot. She doesn't turn me on that much in Mike & Dave. She should of been naked like Aubrey and Sugar. Seemed like a good opportunity! I love this movie because of Aubrey and Sugar. Like 75% Aubrey 25% Sugar 0% Anna. This movie's funny enough and it has a lot of funny parts. The Plaza Devine moments are way better than the Efron Kendrick moments. This is a sloppy hot ass comedy. Speaking of sloppy hot ass I want Aubrey as my wedding date. I want to do ecstasy with Sugar and Anna. I wanna marry Sugar. And give her a massage. This movie's like an 8 in my book because of Aubrey, and Sugar, and Anna. Aubrey mainly.

Efron and Plaza are very talented, but their very talents were not put into good use in this movie. If anything, Efron is the only relatable character, while his brother (Devine) is ideal to play 1997's Beverly Hills Ninja (in Farley's part). Lame script, totally predictable.

" Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is a ""comedy"" that just feels tired.
",-0.4404,0.9826,2018-03-09 00:00:00,4,"Everything here has been done before pretty much and to a better standard. Just a lazy attempt to get some money. Mike and Dave have been ordered to find dates before going to their sister's wedding. Firstly, how would getting two random dates keep these boys in check? This is what their father suggested! Secondly, there is no way that the family would pay for the flights and accommodation for these two random dates. Thirdly, two random dates to a family wedding? I mean really!? What if these dates never progressed? What would be the God damn point!! Meeting the whole family for nothing!!! Urghhhh it's such a silly premise. It would be fine if the script was poking fun out of itself but it's not, it's an entirely serious ""comedy"". Oh, whilst we're on the script, it was pretty terrible. Some jokes hit but it's a combination of drinking, dick and fingering jokes. I'll give the film credit, the whole scene set in the massage parlour and the ATV tour did make me laugh. So that's about 15 out of 100 minutes that were humorous. Not good enough. Zac Efron and Anna Kendrick are better than this (never thought I'd say that about Efron). They delivered well with what they were given so I have to give them credit. Aubrey Plaza plays the same ""I'm drunk, horny and a bitch"" role that she does for most comedies. Adam Devine...nothing divine about his performance (I'm so punny! (notice the pun in that as well)) it literally consisted of him screaming and yelling like a girl. Funny once perhaps, not thirty times. It sounds like I didn't enjoy it, it's actually watchable...if you turn your brain off. If you like crude, rude and dirty jokes then you'll enjoy this. I like to think my humour is better than that so this was not meant for me. That massage scene though...literally when those butt cheeks were rubbing together whilst swinging I proper cracked up!"
" Occasionally funny...often stupid and crude.
",-0.7796,-0.9575,2017-12-30 00:00:00,3,"""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is occasionally quite funny. However, the humor is also often very, very crude and quite stupid. Whether or not you should see it is really dependent on how much you can tolerate the depths to which this comedy sinks.
Mike and Dave (Adam Devine and Zac Efron) are two obnoxious jerk brothers. They have a pattern of getting drunk and stupid at big family events and ruining everything. So, their parents have laid down the law...the pair will NOT ruin their sister's upcoming wedding. And, to make sure, the parents insist the pair find responsible dates to bring along and keep them under control. Unfortunately, they go about finding dates in the worst possible way...by advertising on Craig's List! Not surprisingly, they soon end up with two even more obnoxious partners (Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick)--who are just using them to get a free trip to Hawaii. And, once there, the girls let it all hang out....and create even more havoc than Mike and Dave usually unleash.Often, the jokes involve folks getting naked or drunk or stoned...or all three. Sophisticated, it is NOT...and it's probably not a film to show your kids, preacher or mother. Low-brow and stupid, actually, now that I think about it."

",0.3818,0.8967,2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)Two dudes have a history of ruining large family social events, like weddings, graduations and milestone birthdays. Too much drinking and too much chasing the skirts. For an upcoming wedding in Hawaii, their parents declare they must bring dates, good girls, in order to reign in their behavior. Unable to find dates by placing a public ad with the incentive of a free trip to Hawaii. They later encounter two girls who took a different approach to get their attention. Turns out those girls tricked them into believing they are good and wholesome. It should be no surprise and no film had the wedding gone smoothly so cue Hawaii and a slew of hijinks. How bad will the wedding be ruined and more importantly will the dudes and the girls actually learn from their behavior and reflect upon it for a positive change? Overall, the movie was pretty funny; silly of course. But it at least had a good heart unlike many other from this genre."
" Wedding dates? More like a better film and better humour
",0.9052,0.9454,2017-10-18 00:00:00,3,"Love comedy, there are some great ones out there from every decade and with all kinds of humour (whether it's sophisticated, witty, camp, satirical, dark or vulgar). Silly comedy can be done well, providing it doesn't go overboard. Low-brow comedy is not always done badly, though usually it's my least favourite type of comedy.'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' just didn't do it for me. Can totally understand the mixed critical and audience reaction, especially the many misgivings people have of the film. Seeing as it was based on a true story and have liked some of Aubrey Plaza, Anna Kendrick and Zac Efron's other stuff (even if not a huge fan of either), 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding' had potential to be a halfway decent film. It actually started out on a semi-promising note, with a few sporadically semi-amusing moments, a good set up and it was when the humour and performances didn't go overboard. Then it started to fall apart from the ATV scene and took a turn for the weird halfway through.There are a few good things. The two best performances come from Plaza (though some are going to disagree with this) and Efron. Plaza is in a samey sort of role, but the deadpan nature of it suits her well (though she is best known to me for her work in Seasons 11 and 12 of 'Criminal Minds' as one of the show's best unsubs), the muted indifference and broad farce that critics have picked up on fits with the material and she plays it perfectly.Efron's role is bland, but he does play him straight with a likable charm that was a refreshing counter-balance with the over-acting from most of the rest of the cast. Some of the scenery looks good.However, a lot doesn't work. Kendrick just doesn't fit the material, being better known and more suited to girl-next-door roles, her role requires a broader approach and she is too bland in it and over-compensates in the latter parts of the film. Most of the rest of the cast are underused, and consist of a strange mix of disinterested and overdone. Worst of all are Adam Devine and Sugar Lynn Beard. Devine tries far too hard and comes over as insufferably irritating, especially in the facial expressions and the shouting. Beard constantly sounds like she is on helium and her ""acting"" in the massage scene especially is embarrassing. The chemistry between the actors just isn't there, due to the overacting and mish-mash of acting styles.Can sort of forgive the predictability of the story (the speaker system scene could be seen coming from miles away), can't forgive how disjointed and random it's structured and how everything ends so too-conveniently and resolved in such a hasty manner. The characters may have been intended to be shallow and juvenile, the film however takes this to extremes and makes them mostly without any likable or interesting qualities, only annoying. The only halfway likable character is Dave and he is also bland in development.Soundtrack is forgettable at best and the direction is barely existent. 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' even fails in making Hawaii, one of the world's most beautiful places, look good with some of it looking very straight-to-video quality. A big dishonourable mention in this regard is in the ATV scene, which contains some of the cheapest and worst looking photography and editing for any film seen in any film recently.Biggest problem with 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' is that a vast majority of the time it just isn't funny. A few semi-amusing moments to start with but as said from the ATV scene onward it falls apart where things become increasingly witless and vulgar to the point of being stretched to breaking point. The massage (a particularly distasteful scene that went on too long and should have been cut), sauna, ecstasy and argument in the hotel room scenes induce a mega cringe-factor especially. Too many scenes are also dragged out where severely affects the timing which comes over as limp and the jokes become unfunny consequently.Dialogue has far too much of a vulgar edge to the point a lot of it falls into uncomfortable distaste. Things seemed to take a turn for the downright weird halfway through, with some attempts at seriousness when there are various revelations made that are executed in a forced and seen from a mile off way.In summary, a few decent things are not enough to save a poorly done film on most levels. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
" Who are those girls?
",0.0,0.9186,2017-10-17 00:00:00,8,"Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) are brothers who wholesale liquor to bars. They have a propensity to ruin family gatherings. When their sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) is getting married to Eric (Sam Richardson) in Hawaii, they are required to come with dates so they don't go chasing the female guests. They place a Craig's List ad which goes viral. In a subplot Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) are cocktail waitresses who like to drink and party too much which has led to their current state of unemployment. They connive a way to look sweet and innocent in order to get a free trip to Hawaii, something Alice really needs. As expected, the girls are too much like their male counterparts.The plot is basically formula. The comedy is at times crude, but tends to rise slightly above the trashy teen sex comedies. Drinking and drug humor is included. A basic fun contemporary comedy hashtag I heart Anne Kendrick.Guide: F-word, sex talk, brief sex scenes, Sugar Lyn Beard nudity with a fake beard."
" Well-made comedy with relateable characters
",0.3612,0.9983,2017-10-04 00:00:00,8,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (2016) is one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time. I try to watch anything with Aubrey Plaza in it, but didn't catch this one in the theater. Not only is it hilariously improvised, it's also based on a true story. The unbelievable misadventure of Mike and Dave Stangle, who were instructed to bring dates to their sister's wedding in Saratoga, New York, inspired the film. They posted an ad on Craigslist in February 2013, which went viral. Real life Mike and Dave, from Albany, even have a cameo in the film.In the movie version of events, Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) face an ultimatum from family members over a history of hard partying and ruining family gatherings. Their parents, Burt (Stephen Root) and Rosie (Stephanie Faracy) Stangle, insist they bring dates to their sister Jeanie's (Sugar Lyn Beard) wedding in Hawaii. She is marrying Eric (Sam Richardson), who is grounded and emotionally reserved. After their Craigslist ad goes viral, they run through a series of hilarious dates before meeting Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza), another pair of hard-partiers who pretend to be nice girls to get a free trip to Hawaii.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates was written by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien and directed by Jake Szymanski. Szymanski has directed dozens of video shorts and a few television episodes and TV movies, which might explain why the film felt like a series of skits seamlessly woven together. Make no mistake, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates not only has a plot, it also has character development, two things often missing from other recently-released comedies.The film is simply about four shallow, emotionally juvenile people maturing and finding happiness. Dave learns he needs a separate identity from his brother and decides to pursue his talent at drawing, Alice finally gets over being left at the altar and pursues a relationship with Dave, and Mike and Tatiana go into business together. They patch things up with their sister after derailing her ceremony, and use their talents to make sure Jeanie gets the Hawaii wedding she deserves. Even Eric gets to show he's not as straight-laced as he appears. It's not a complex story, but what else can you expect from a raunchy romantic comedy? Its only glaring plot hole involved the rivalry between Mike and his sexually ambiguous cousin, Terry (Alice Wetterlund). Terry and Mike are continually trying to one-up each other and compete for Tatiana's affection. Terry plays a key role in pushing Mike over the edge when he sees Terry and Tatiana in a steam room in flagrante delicto. As all other conflicts are being resolved, however, Terry seems to disappear from the movie. Terry does apologize for her behavior, but in a deleted scene. It's not a strong scene and I see why it was cut, but it leaves that whole subplot dangling in the air while everything else is tied up in a neat bow.In terms of characters, Adam Devine, Zac Efron, Anna Kendrick, and Aubrey Plaza were perfect for their roles. In the wrong hands, the four protagonists threatened to be annoying, unlikable, and generally disgusting human beings. Somehow they come off as sincere, well-intentioned, and charming, despite their lies, self-indulgence, and destructive behavior. It took skilled actors and actresses to maintain that delicate balance. Despite all the chaos they cause, the audience roots for them to clean up their acts and save the day.Most importantly, the characters are relateable. They are flawed and self-conscious, just like everyone in the audience. In one scene, Tatiana and Mike finally have a heartfelt conversation. Tatiana turns to Mike and says, ""I thought I was, like, destined for such great things, but I may never achieve anything."" Who hasn't felt like that at least once in their life? Aubrey Plaza conveys real emotional depth in her expressions. She shows her character's vulnerability while at the same time hinting she might have some affection for Mike after all.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is relentlessly funny, but behind the crazy, over-the-top humor there's an actual movie with characters we like and relate to despite their flaws. That combination is what made this film so successful. Most critics hated it, but I agree with San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle when he wrote, ""The beauty of the film is that, though it is utterly coarse in its content, it's not coarse or sloppy in its craftsmanship."""
" Mike and Dave Need Some Better Jokes
",0.5994,0.9424,2017-10-01 00:00:00,3,"A raunchy comedy about hard-partying brothers Mike (Adam Devine, Zac Efron) who start a public campaign to find perfect dates (Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza) for their sister's Hawaiian wedding, so the family would be pleased for once. Supposedly based on a true story. American mainstream comedies have a lot of improvised dialogue and scenes these days which can be great. Also, as in this case, it can bring mediocre results when there's not much content backing all that impro-ing, or the players are not able to get creative enough. In this case, there's enough story for an unpretentious 98 minute entertainment but the dialogue remains generic and performances feel uninspired. Both leading men, Efron and Devine, have done this sort of thing so much that they're always kind of cool. But the leading ladies, Aubrey and Kendrick, don't impress at all. They don't develop much of a flow of their own and settle for copying the guys. Dirty jokes are not that good either, and the blissful massage section which is supposed to be one of the major setpieces, is just painfully unfunny. Â„Mike and Dave"" comes from the writers of Â„Neighbors"" and Â„Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" but offers none of the fun and energy of said comedies, not that these were true classics or anything. It certainly doesn't help that at least three of the four leads have done this sort of thing way too much in recent past. It's hard to get excited again when all you're seeing is a case of SSDD."
" Rehashed and tired jokes are getting quite old
",-0.2263,0.9033,2017-09-14 00:00:00,6,"So this movie is based on a real story of two idiot brothers who decided to put on Craigslist for a free trip. Now, it wasn't to Hawaii but the Hamptons, but still. Who does that? For the movie alone, there was quite a bit comedy to the movie. More than I thought there would be with the cast involved. Granted Zac Efron has been in quite a few comedies as of late, but he needs to get out of them. This was a completely different role for Anna Kendrick (my #1), but she nailed it. Aubrey Plaza and Adam Devine played the same characters they always. Honestly, the thing that killed this movie for was the same tired, old jokes that have been in a lot of movies. They need new material. Where they're going to get it from is anyone's guess. That, and the cousin in the movie was just done right annoying. Seriously, if love the comedies that Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Zac Efron, and the likes of have put on since Superbad came out ten years ago, then this is the movie for you. I'm getting tired of them. Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks."

" Funny
",0.4404,0.9942,2017-09-03 00:00:00,6,"I know this is a low brow movie; I know the jokes are lame, and the humour is often offensive. I know it is formulaic, and the wedding theme has been done to death, but I couldn't help but like this movie. In spite of all its flaws, I enjoyed it and actually laughed many times throughout. I think its charm is due to the characters and their relationships to each other. These are people, albeit cartoonish people, who have a real love and affection for each other: the brothers have a strong connection and they deeply love their little sister, who is a wonderfully fresh personality, and her fiancÃ© is a breath of fresh air in a genre full of clichÃ©s - a cautious, nerdy, introspective, good-hearted man who loves his wife- to-be more than anything in the world. The parents love their children despite their exasperation. There is lots of action and the actors play their parts with energy and affection for the characters - nobody is phoning it in. I would say the only weakness was with the wedding dates themselves, played by Aubrey Plaza, and Anna Kendrick. I'm lukewarm about both actresses and did not really like the characters they played - too mean and too stupid to be believed."
" Mike and Dave Need Better Dates
",0.4404,0.9631,2017-07-24 00:00:00,4,"A good premise but they placed the ad on Craig's list of all places. Guys like them deserve girls like them that much is true but the point here was to keep them in check for that you really need bouncers or military officers, nannies or babysitters even. Comedies nowadays push the envelope on that cringe factor and this is definitely one of them. At Hawaii things quickly take a turn for the worse. If you could tolerate the awkwardness then the humour is LOL. The parts where Dave and Alice were alone and talking were good. They had chemistry and seriously more of that was required but the movie makers decided we need more crude humour like the brother walking in on his sister while she is naked which was done twice. The first time it was overkill. A sensual orgasmic massage with Kumail. Kumail you are better than this man? That scene was not at all funny and brother Dave walks in followed immediately by Dave walking in on his date fingering his cousin for Rihana tickets. I know Tatiana it is Rihana but nothing is excusable for that. Alice and Jeanie take ecstasy with Dave walking in on his naked sister right after the horrible fight with Mike. It was funny but a line was crossed so the laughter leads to a feeling of depression. It gave me a headache because instead of sleeping I watched it late into the night. Damn I wish I stopped after watching the funny Carmichael show I would have slept contentedly."
" Classic pop comedy
",0.3612,0.8009,2017-07-17 00:00:00,2,"This seems to be a standard for modern comedy: good-looking cast, forced jokes and terrible acting. This seems to have been written and scripted in 2 hours at best. I haven't laughed once. Jokes are classic, modern, everything but funny jokes. They attempt a joke every single scene. Jokes are being forced into the dialog. Continuous usage of similar jokes in the same scenes are failure as well. Acting is pretty terrible, I mean comedies have never been known for a top notch acting, but still this is just rubbish. It seems like modern comedy actors are chosen only by their looks. To conclude, I would never suggest someone to check this movie, it is the worst thing ever. Classic piece of commercial society."

I remember thinking half way through the movie ""where is this going?"" Overall I would give the plot a 5.Characters: I would say Zac Effron and Adam DeVine are what made this movie even remotely watchable. I like Anna Kendrick but not in this movie and I am not a fan of Aubrey Plaza at all, She is just not my style. Overall a 6 on Characters.Conclusion: I would say the worst part of the movie was the conclusion. The writers were teetering on a stupid funny movie and a funny movie with a romantic twist. Needless to say they went with stupid funny, with no real conclusion to the dates that they brought. Conclusion was a 3.Overall After a few days of watching movies that were action packed, this was a nice alternative. Between that and sports having an off night, that is the only reason this movie made it onto my TV. Worth the watch? possibly. Deciding between movies? Pick the other oneOverall a 4 out of 10"

It was thankfully not too vulgar and relied on the performances of its four main cast members to bring it home. There was great chemistry between the four, some funny moments that most audiences should laugh at and slightly sentimental too. Audrey is a natural treasure but the weakest link was Anna Kendrick who was not as funny as she was annoying. You know this film is not in the running for any Oscars but it exists to entertain and achieved that. Glad I watched it."

Real-life link: There is one instance where the events in this movie imitate those of real life: that you got to act to get what you want. To explain, the girls made the trip to Hawaii possible because they took action that had that consequence. The presented themselves so that they would fit what the boys were looking for even though that was not their true self and the created the circumstance where they would notice them (being hit by the car). They created the circumstances that were beneficial for them. All the other events on the movie are Hioliwoodised and have little possibility of happening, they are exaggerated for entertainment purposes and it works because the movie is quite entertaining. Storyline: Flows nicely. Th events lead nicely to one another, no boredom is created and the story moves fast. The story in build on characters underlying development rather then on the superficial events. Everything that happens is as a result of character development which is something not many movies can achieve. Overall a good movie."

I saw this for free on an airplane so at least I didn't pay, and I'm sure some of the movie was edited for content so I can only imagine how much worse the full/unedited version might be.

Hey, I get that I'm not the target audience for this rubbish, and that it serves a similar function as the Frankie Avalon or Gidget movies did for 60s teens, but this makes 'How To Stuff A Wild Bikini' or 'Beach Blanket Bingo' seem positively Shakespearean by comparison. While they both share the same absence of any discernible story arc and an empty- headed poverty of dialog, 'Mike and Dave...' is just mean spirited and humourless - the first 42 minutes, at least.

It starts where Mike and Dave settle on two girls, Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alicia (Anna Kendrick), who turn out not to be respectable at all, but just as self-absorbed and clueless as they are. They are also just as rude, ready for alcohol, the film does evince a welcome sense of gender parity for bad behavior.Similar to Wedding Crashers, Hollywood demands that the wedding is messed up, so no surprises there, nor in what happens afterwards. All four actors have great comic timing and their improvisation skills are tested, but within the content of the film, crude sexual gags and tastelessness hammering the same jokes over and over hold them back. This film isn't clever, witty or funny enough to warrant anything more than a one time viewing. For films such as this in which we know what it is about, it's utterly predictable and not as entertaining as it could have been. Simply put, the jokes aren't that great as to warrant consistent laughs, just light chuckles."

So for their sister's wedding in Hawaii, their parents give them an ultimatum--either they bring nice girls as dates or they don't show up at all.Right away you think to yourself, ""Well they probably have a couple of female friends that are parent approved."" Whether or not this would work for the characters' dilemma, this simple solution is never addressed. Mike and Dave jump straight to placing an ad on Craigslist, advertising a free trip to Hawaii, because that's the easiest way to get strange women to go on vacation with you. The unrealistic thought process of the characters not only insults the audience's intelligence, but lets us know that the film is just a means to an end, uninterested in actual logic.Situations within a ridiculous premise still have to be cohesive to that ridiculous premise. Writers can't just do anything they want just because they've established a impractical scenario.After placing the ad, the guys get thousands of responses but inexplicably can't find girls who are acceptable enough for their parents' standards. Eventually, a pair of trashy girls (Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick) decide they want a free vacation and put on a nice-girl front so the guys will want to take them.There are plot holes galore in this setup, but it's also the time in the movie with the best comedy. The rest of the way includes some funny isolated moments, but for the most part it tapers off. Then when it tries to stretch the already-thinning plot, things get weird and unnecessary.With that said, I laughed more than I probably should have. DeVine has a true knack for comedy, which only serves to outshine his costars, constantly creating a juxtaposition of how poor the rest of them are.Besides the initial archetypes set for the characters, their personalities are constantly wavering. We're made to like and dislike certain characters on a whim based on what's convenient to the story at any given moment. I do applaud, however, that the film doesn't really waste time trying to create conflict and develop a relationship between the two girls. Whether this was inadvertent or intentional, it works in favor of the overall product.At one point in the story the film Wedding Crashers is mentioned, which only reminds us of what we could be watching instead.Twizard Rating: 60"
" Some of the performances were noticeably more enjoyable than others.
",0.4927,0.7132,2017-01-30 00:00:00,6,"Overall, this film benefited from a refreshing flip of gender roles that allowed Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick to play characters that would usually merit a Seth Rogen. However, this was a comedy built on the performances of a select few actors, so it was a bit glaring when some of those performances were noticeably more enjoyable than others. Zac Efron's dull ""acting"" felt forced when paired with Adam Devine's innate hilarity, and Anna Kendrick's kindhearted ridiculousness helped drown out Aubrey Plaza's cacophonous attempt to add swagger to her monotone drawl. Despite these discrepancies, the film was entertaining. The Take: We're not movie critics, but we might be better. https://twitter.com/thetaketweets http://filmtake.tumblr.com/"
" Uneven, Unfunny, and Uninspired
",0.0,0.9469,2017-01-28 00:00:00,3,"You may have thought this would be a sort of reverse ""Wedding Crashers"", and the problem is that it is - including the reversal in comedic content.Mike and Dave are wild (really?) brothers who screw up major events so their dad mandates they must bring dates to their sister's wedding in Hawaii to keep then on an even keel. See, there's the problem right there: these guys are going to meet someone on short notice whom both will be so invested in that they'll behave? This is particularly bad when their search goes viral, as the randomness just gets higher.Plaza - playing essentially the same character she did on 'Parks and Rec' and Kendrick (really?) are two losers who decide to angle in just to get the free trip to Hawaii. Scheming on, they're in. So off they go.You would think two such women would be all over giving it up to the two hunky guys who gave them a free ""vacay"". That neither are, and that neither is really as hot as needed for the role, stunts any attempt at plot or story. That the sister and her (for no apparent reason, black) fiancÃ© are both as dull as dishwater doesn't help. The guys' aggressive, bisexual cousin in the mix shows the desperation level the writers got to. Sauna scene - ugh.The guys aren't wild enough (Ephron being about as sensitive as possible) and the girls aren't hot enough, and no one is funny enough.Not too long ago, they would have amped up the raunch enough to make this marketable and funny. But the PC-balance now seemingly required for films keeps the sophomoric humor - about the only kind that will work here - at bay. Result: a couple funny moments in an otherwise forgettable film other than DeVine who is actually pretty good.Next time, get some hotties, have them have troubles keeping up their 'good girl' appearance, show some T&A, and see what happens. I suspect more laughs and more box office."
" An attempt at an objective review
",0.0,0.9763,2017-01-24 00:00:00,6,"Mike & Dave are going to their sister's wedding. Due to the fact that they wreck every engagement they attend - their parents insist they have dates. Of course their dates turn out to be less than perfect.I watch these kind of movies hoping I will enjoy them. But I rarely do - maybe I am just too straight laced - but I will try and be impartial.This movie has every one of the staples that make for mad-cap gross out comedy. There is swearing, drug taking, nudity, improvised arguments, drunken antics, stunts, and family members caught in inappropriate situations.If this is your thing then I think you may like this. It is well made and compared to similar titles a lot of the set pieces are reigned in (not nearly enough for me though) before they become too stupid.The stars of the shows are definitely Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza - who have more interesting characters and give great performances.I didn't mind this movie - I just feel I have seen it all before. But well made and if this is your kind of thing I think you will enjoy it."
" 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' needs more than a date.
",0.0,0.999,2017-01-23 00:00:00,4,"I think the vulgar wedding comedy has formed its own sub genre these days. With films like 'Wedding Crashers', 'Bridesmaids', 'American Wedding', and 'The Hangover', you have all the ingredients to make a modern audience laugh with toilet humor, vulgar language, sex, drugs, excessive amounts of alcohol, and a happy ending (pun very intended). The next on the list of this current sub-genre of wedding comedies is 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates', which is actually based off a real life story of brothers Mike and Dave Stangle, who took to the internet to find dates for their sister's wedding, offering a free trip. They went viral, got a ton of responses, went on national television, and had a book come out.Is there funny vulgar language here? Yes. Are there tons of drinking, drugs, and sex jokes here? Yes. That being said, there isn't anything new or original here, and we've all seen this before, several times. Yes, there are some funny moments here and there, but the film really loses steam quickly, due to the lack of any kind of real story. Instead, it just moves from next joke to the next joke to the next joke, all which involve drinking, sex, drugs, or saying the word ""fuck"" a few times in a matter of seconds.Here, Mike and Dave are played by Adam Devine ('Workaholics') and Zac Efron, who take to Craig's List to look for wedding dates for their high pitched voiced sister's wedding in Hawaii. Mike and Dave are known to be the hard party dude's who bring the fun and also destruction to every party they attend, whether it be a family party, a funeral, or friend's rave. Their father (Stephen Root) tells them they need to not be the drunk assholes like they usually are at functions and be on their best behavior, and also need to bring actual respectable dates, instead of trying to hook up with every girl they come into contact with.Enter Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick who play Tatiana and Alice respectively who are actually more ridiculous and ruthless than Mike and Dave themselves. However, the two girls play nice in order to get to Hawaii, which is when the big laughs are supposed to happen. Sure there are some funny moments with a hardcore massage with a happy ending, a lesbian scene in a steam room, and a naked drug induced scene with horses, but none of them really stick the landing in a big way. Sure, you'll laugh here and there, but it's mostly from the insane and hyper-vulgar dialogue from the actors and nothing more. Even that runs its course early on.Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick are fun enough and have great comedic timing even if their characters are unlikable for the most part. Adam Devine is turned up to 11 here as the funny man where Zac Efron plays the straight laced guy. Their chemistry is energetic and it looks like they had a lot of fun in Hawaii, which is mostly why I think everyone decided to say ""Yes"" to this project â€“ a free trip to Hawaii. Come to think of it, there was a better comedy made in Hawaii, which was 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. Still, for a mindless summer vulgar comedy that has a tiny bit of charm, 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' should satisfy you for a minute or two when it comes out on Netflix.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!"
" Not funny, and not as raunchy as you'd expect
",-0.3412,0.9882,2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Zac Efron is uncommonly pretty for a man. He is so good looking, in fact, that I don't believe he works as a lead. His face is a punchline for a joke ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" never supplies. The movie seems to be going for the dynamic that ""Mike and Dave"" are funny together because Dave is much better looking than Mike, and Mike is more of an obnoxious goofball while Dave is the romantic pretty boy. In fact, Adam Devine as Mike is actually very handsome by anyone's estimation, and the chemistry between the two guys just isn't funny. They give it their all in scenes where you want to applaud them for their chutzpah, even if you aren't laughing while doing it.Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick, though? They're funny. It's too bad the movie doesn't really know what to do with them. It doesn't know whether to make them the shameless party girls the plot requires, or cave into the expectations of the audience and have them be the perfect role models women in movies these days always are. For one thing, the movie hedges around sex. Plaza and Kendrick play trainwrecks who love drinking, drugging, getting wasted and watching porno together. But there is nary a mention of their sex lives; a major plot point is made of the Plaza character leading on Devine's Mike, but resolving never to have sex with him. What's the point of the lead on? And are we expected to believe that these too party girls draw the line at sex? Why would they â€“ or is this just the filmmakers condescending to us, assuming we'll be put off by girls who are promiscuous?In fact, for a supposedly raunchy comedy, the movie seems fairly puritanical about sex in general. The presence of Maron, Nanjiani and Crawford all spelt a good time, but only Nanjiani gets a memorable scene. Perhaps, as he lost weight, Crawford also lost his gift for comedy?"
" Very nice!
",0.5244,0.9939,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I was very excited for the comedy of this film, simply because the trailers seemed to splice scenes at awkward moments - but I was laughing hysterically for nearly the whole film! The relationship between the four leads was both funny and heartwarming, and while the comedy took a crude turn at times, it never stretched reality so far that I was taken out of the moment. Sidenote - the girl who plays ""little Genie"" absolutely blew me away with her performance! Very unexpected! Overall the film was nicely cast, save for a few roles that required very specific looks. Great suspense and soundtrack, great location, and great costuming! Very very funny."
" Does what it's designed to do, make you laugh
",0.5574,0.8618,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Luckily I did not see the previews until after the movie, and I saw the movie at home rather than at the theater. Gave the movie an 8 because I laughed so hard, it needs to have an unforgettable story line to get close to a 10.The movie had a simple story and flowed pretty obvious sequence. Anna Kendrick and Adam Devine has their own brand of humor, and the movie showed it off well. Made us laugh hysterically, lots of slapstick humor, and the jokes flowed well. Zac is not very creative, but even Anna has a hard time getting a word in around Adam, so Zac stayed in the shadow most of the time, but played it well.The movie was meant to be stupid and funny, and not to be taken seriously. If you want to laugh and aren't looking for award style acting, this does the it."
