" Compassionate story that respects the kids it portrays
",0.6705,0.69,2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,"Our family loved this film. It is that wonderful balance of family appropriate, but with real peril and stakes for the characters. The way that it demonstrated difficult choices for each character along their journey felt grounded and something we could all relate to. We just wish more families knew about how good this film is!"
" Amazing Movie
",0.5859,0.996,2020-11-29 00:00:00,10,"I feel like this movie was absolutely amazing. The movie was about a very young girl named Phiona who is living a hard life in Uganda. She and her family are living in poverty and are struggling. Phiona's family is a lot more poor than the other people in Katwe. Phiona discovers chess because of her neighborhood peers and finds that she is really good at chess. A chess teacher finds her and discovers that she is actually really good at playing chess. This is her one way of getting her out of Katwe and living a much better life than she was living previously. Phiona goes through a journey and is put under pressure in her chess championships. She feels like she doesn't belong at the chess championships because she doesn't look like the other people there. The other people there look like they are living well and she feels like that she does not belong there.I think that it is crazy that this movie is based on a true story and that someone actually went through all of this and was able to tell their story through a movie. The actors in this movie did a great job. The actors made the movie feel so real and it definitely made me cry. It is very sad to see people working hard and living in poverty and struggling to live in Katwe. This movie shows all the hardships that Fiona and her family had to go through when they were living in Uganda. This movie will definitely get you out of your comfort zone. The people in Katwe still manage to make life happy by singing and dancing even though they are close to hunger and close to living in the streets. I think that it was very sad to watch people living like this. This film was a very inspiring and motivational real life story.I am very surprised that not a lot of people have heard of this movie. I didn't even know about this movie until now. This movie had such an amazing story and I think Disney did a very good job. I feel like other people should watch this movie because this movie will definitely make you cry and it is something very different. This movie deserves a lot more publicity and praise and it's crazy how Disney lost money from this movie. I was surprised that there are a few people who think that this movie wasn't really good. The story was amazing, the actors made it feel very realistic, and the music in the movie was really good. This story is very deep and I think that it deserves an Oscar. Overall, this is a movie that you definitely need to watch whenever you have free time and you feel like watching something different from other movies. If I had to rate this movie then I would give it a ten. I would recommend this to my friends and I would watch this film again."
" Fascinating chess movie that preceded ""Queen's Gambit""
",0.5423,0.9829,2020-11-26 00:00:00,9,"Queen of Katwe (2016) is a movie from Uganda, directed by Mira Nair. Queen of Katwe is unusual in that it's a Disney film. Apparently, the executives at Disney actually wanted a film that was very foreign (to us) and outside Disney's safe-bet comfort zone. That's what this movie is, and it works.For most people in the U.S. this movie will be outside of our comfort zone as well. It's based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi, portrayed by newcomer Madina Nalwanga. Phiona comes from the Katwe slums, and life there isn't easy. The people of Katwe still manage to survive, dance, and sing. However, almost all of them are one payment away from hunger and eviction.David Oyelowo plays Robert Katende, who, although a trained engineer, works as a soccer and chess coach. Lupita Nyong'o is an Academy Award winning Kenyan/Mexican actor. She portrays Phiona's mother, Nakku Harriet. It's no surprise that she is outstanding in the role.Although this is a film about chess, you don't have to know chess to enjoy the movie. Anyway, it's not really a movie about chess--it's a coming-of-age movie about a young woman who is extraordinarily gifted in the game.Beth Harmon in The Queen's Gambit was a fictional character. Phiona Mutesi is a real person, and her story is a real story. It's definitely worth watching.Although Queen of Katwe was meant to be seen on the large screen, it works well enough on the small screen. The film has a solid IMDb rating of 7.4. I thought it was much better than that, and rated it 9."
" It's about much more than just chess
",0.0,0.9942,2020-11-17 00:00:00,8,"Excellent.'Queen of Katwe' is another Disney sports biopic, but one made with a difference - it doesn't hit the exact same notes as the studio usually does in this genre, which is a positive. The film is shot lovely, with a terrific main cast.Lupita Nyong'o is top notch in the role of Nakku, while Madina Nalwanga impresses in the lead as Phiona. David Oyelowo would be my personal standout, he's terrific as Robert, but all three add a great deal to the film to be fair. A few of the child actors give good support performances, also.It does slightly suffer with the fact its story revolves around chess, which isn't the most exciting or massively interesting game/sport to watch across 124 minutes. However, it's about much more than just chess - it features a big life story too. It does a grand job at making you care for the individuals onscreen.Highly recommend."
" She didnt get a dime from the movie
",0.0,0.4497,2020-09-29 00:00:00,1,"Like the movie, but was shocked when I learned that she didn't get any money from Disney from making a movie about her. When you see their poverty, and know how wealthy Disney is and how many lives they could have changed, it's just sad. The rich will be richer."

To be honest my expectations for this movie were above average, owing to the fact that it is a Disney Sports movie, and I can't remember the last bad one i'd seen. This movie though, is beautiful and very heartwarming, I had tears in my eyes at the end. The acting is great from all the cast , but the youngsters steal the show. A great film to watch which will leave a wide smile on your face."

But the film lost its touch in the second half, and the child actors' acting is baad. The story is itself is inspiring but it wasn't told the way it should be.The highlight to me is the credit part, where the characters meet their original selves. It's very creative and fun to watch."

" 10 year old Ugandan slum girl achieves chess championship
",0.4404,0.9891,2020-08-08 00:00:00,9,"We all love true stories of how the underdogs and less privileged finally achieve success through sheer grit and determination overcoming all obstacles. This film shows how a 10 year old black girl Phiona from the slums in Uganda chases her dream and is successful in winning a chess championship, hence becoming a chess prodigy. A child of a poverty stricken single mother (Lupita, excellent) with siblings to look after, Phiona clears all hurdles encouraged by her coach Robert (reminds me of Sydney Poitier). Director Mira Nair once again does an excellent job be it the depiction of slum life, or the abject poverty of the family or the excitement of the chess competition . Some scenes are touching indeed. Lupita tells her daughter to put off the lamp to save paraffin, Lupita locked out of her room with kids, her selling off her favourite dress, her slipping away from hospital to escape payment etc. These scenes make it worth a watch. The director is helped by the splendid cinematography and first rate technical aspects. The film is neither melodramatic nor a tear jerker. It is a realistic slice of life sincerely projected through a smooth narrative. A must watch indeed."

" The Power of Belief
",0.0,0.9676,2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"I decided to watch this movie as it was directed by Mira Nair and I am happy that I did. It is based on a real story captured in a book by the same name. While I haven't read the book, the way the movie was made, it doesn't seem the makers tried to go overboard to make to over-dramatic. The story itself is very impactful.
The movie takes us to a small fishing village in Uganda and gets us acquainted with Phiona, who along with her younger brother, sells maize in the market to support her single mother, who is trying to raise her 4 kids against all odds. One day she stumbles upon a club where Robert is training kids in the game of chess. He is a part time worker, whose life was changed by chess and he wants to give these kids the same chance. His vision is also supported by his wife, who is a primary school teacher. Phiona has a natural knack for the game and the rest of the story is how she grows proficient in the game, overcoming her obstacles.
While it has all the general elements associated with any other movie of showing a child fighting to overcome all the odds and come out as a winner in the end, but the way it is shown makes all the difference.
The game chosen here was chess, which is a game of tactics and strategy and it takes a different kind of preparation to be better at it. Thankfully, the movie wasn't about long motivational speeches, but was rather about believing in a better future and working towards it. The biggest obstacle that was shown in off hand remarks was the need to believe that the kids belong to the big league. When they are playing a game, they often think that they can't win because they are from a marginalized background, but once they are able to believe in themselves that they can, then they do it.
While most of the actors did reasonably well, I think the most impactful role was that of Phiona's mother. She was shown as a strong mother, who is righteous and keeps fighting her circumstances everyday for her children."
" Very Good Movie

This movie remind me about my school teachers (like coach) in back home, who always used to encourage me, who made me strong and made me to believe in myself. I miss them. Now a days, we can NEVER find a true coach like Mr. Robert."

So different to the usual American based movies, and the story was told so beautifully.
I'm not going to lie, the movie was long, but it definitely helped build the suspense.
The acting was amazing and the casting was spectacular.
The characters really stand out. I also really liked that they got the real people and the actors who played them at the end. It was a cute touch.
This movie should have been hyped up more."
" Heartfelt, positive sample outlook of African culture through the eyes of young chess champion
",0.9001,0.996,2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"One of the really good things about Disney's Queen of Katwe is that someone finally decided to make a positive film about African people. As director Mira Nair cogently points out, most of the films about Africa involve war, dictatorships, child soldiers and famine. What's lost is the complexity and rich culture of many African communities. Here that complexity is richly on view, with the tale of Phiona Mutesi, a young girl who became an international chess champion from Katwe, an impoverished neighborhood in the capital city of Kampala, Uganda. In addition to an extraordinary cast, Nair is the real star here; I urge everyone to listen to her commentary about the film as part of the DVD extras. She is a brilliant woman who will keep you entranced with all the stories about the making of the film.
Nair went through hundreds of girls before she found dancer Madina Nalwanga and cast her as Phiona. The film star Lupita Nyong'o is great as her mother, Nakku Harriet, who can be best described as mother courage, keeping a strong, protective eye over her entire brood, consisting of a younger and older brother and an older sister Night (Taryn ""Kay"" Kyaze).
Phiona's ""call to adventure"" begins when she joins a chess club for Katwe kids run by government worker (and aspiring engineer) Robert Katende. David Oyelowo is brilliant as Katende, Phiona's mentor, teaching her the game of chess and encouraging her to fulfill her dreams. There is conflict throughout including when Phiona first joins the Pioneers (the Katwe chess kids) and is taunted for her lack of education (she's completely illiterate and doesn't begin school until she's 13 years old), her lack of good hygiene (as the family is too poor to have indoor plumbing) and also the fact that she is a girl. With Katende's help, Phiona gradually overcomes her lack of confidence and succeeds in the chess world, mainly populated by much more economically advantaged children.
The class differences in Ugandan society are highlighted in high relief when Nair shows us how the Katwe kids are treated when they arrive at their first formal chess competition at an upper class boarding school (the rich kids wipe their hands at every turn, for fear of infection by the kids from the ""other side of the tracks). More conflicts emerge beyond Phiona's quest to leave Katwe and achieve true independence. Katende ends up giving up a much better paying job as an engineer, to continue to coach his kids. Meanwhile, Harriet butts heads with Katende as she wants to protect Phiona from disappointment. There's also the mother's conflict with the older daughter Night, who has been going out with questionable men who Harriet is convinced will eventually do her harm.
Phiona reaches her dark moment at the end of the second act when she loses at the Chess Olympiad in Russia. The ""road back"" is difficult as she's back home with her mother and realizes she no longer fits in at all in the impoverished Katwe world. The family endures one crisis after another: the younger brother is hit by a motorbike and Harriet doesn't have the money to pay the doctors at the hospital after they perform surgery; Harriet and the kids must endure a flood and are also evicted from their home. Phiona finally asks to stay with Katende and his wife where she begins to go to school and regain her confidence.
The denouement is heartfelt, as Phiona finally wins the national championship and is able to buy her mother her own home. Nair and her cinematographers capture the wonderfully colorful landscape of Uganda, utilizing a wide number of African pop songs, casting music pop stars in cameo roles. The film's only real drawback is the difficulty of making chess into something visually exciting. Nair actually does her best in that department, as there were actually 15 separate chess scenes, each having their own distinctive character (the focus is always on the players and spectators' visual reactions).
If you wish to learn something about African culture, The Queen of Katwe is the place to go. Africa will no longer be a threatening place after watching this film."
" Overall, it's...fine.
",0.0,0.7003,2020-03-23 00:00:00,6,"This is exactly what you might expect from a true-life Disney sports movie about chess; good, but kinda basic. As someone who knows nothing about chess, the movie does the heavy-lifting so I could understand how to feel at each moment. The performances are very good, especially Oyelowo, but the most notable aspect of the film is its soulful representation of single motherhood."
" warm and uplifting
",0.2263,0.9787,2019-11-02 00:00:00,9,"Phiona Mutesi, daughter of a widowed mother, grows up penniless and uneducated in Katwe, a slum of Kampala. Then she is introduced to chess and proves to be prodigiously talented at it. Could this be her way out of poverty?Disney is behind this true story, an unusual sort of project for them to back. Lupita Nyong'o is Mum and David Oyelowo is coach Robert. Apart from them, the entire cast is untried Ugandan talent, with Madina Nalwanga shouldering the lion's share as Phiona. In her sole IMDB credit. she does this effortlessly - she has great screen presence.Location work looks authentic and, while the story is not unfamiliar, it has the benefit of being true. The closing credits match the actors with their real-life counterparts and are enormously touching.I enjoyed this a lot."
" From the slums of Uganda a genius arise
",0.0,0.9412,2019-10-09 00:00:00,10,This is the true story of Phiona Mutesi. She is but a child from a poverty stricken fatherless home in a Ugandan slum. However she has something very special and that thing is her keen analytical mind. Her ability to see several chess moves ahead serves her well and enables her to be victorious in many chess games around the world. You don't need to be a chess player to love this movie. It's terrific. Just search for her name and read her bio at the Wikipedia.
" made me goosebumps :)

" Queen of Slums to Queen of Chess
",0.0,0.973,2018-10-09 00:00:00,10,"Based on a true rags to riches story, this film lacks filthy language but has filthy living both morally and socially. In short, it centres around a preteen-teens slum girl (Phiona), who lives among the dregs and where prostitution is one way of survival - her big sister ('Night') takes that limited option. Their mother is a godly widow but financially helpless to hold back Night for long.A chance encounter with Robert Katende who runs a Christian missionary program, opens up the interest of chess for Phiona, who soon shows unusually high intelligence for the game. She progresses through setbacks to achieve national honour as a chess master, which incidentally will benefit her immediate family. Some of the other slum kids coached by Katende also rise to high level, and there is a pitting of their determination over the comparative pastime of children from society's higher levels. A story is told of a dog that failed to make a cat its meal because the dog (well to do kids) chased for a mere meal while the cat (slum kids) ran for its life.The coach has sought a better lifestyle, but when offered one he must decide whether to put his interests above the interests of others - will he remain Katende; will his wife back him? At a number of points he goes the extra mile to be a blessing.The mother (Nakku Harriet) must suffer much hardship: widowhood; how to live morally in a corrupt society; how to face eviction; how to deal with unpayable debt from an injured son; how to deal with prostitution money without affirming prostitution; how to mother a single daughter-mother; how much freedom to allow, and help to give, Phiona's journey into chess and away from family lifestyle.The film has dreadfulness (Katwe is a Ugandan slum); it has humour (a young girls gets carted off from a chess completion sobbing, ""he took my queen""); it has disappointment (Night becomes a girl of the night); it has tension (flood waters endanger a young child). Overall the picture is of goodness rising above the depravation, and talented individuals going through learning curves about good living. A heart-warming film well worth watching and heeding."
" Brilliant! Inspiring! Heartbreaking!
",0.6679,0.9968,2018-09-26 00:00:00,10,"I was not expecting this when I clicked on this title in my Netflix on a calm Wednesday morning. As a freelancer trying to make it on my own, I felt the words ""challenges are not a curse"" burned in me. The casual writing behind the ""motorcar"" for ""The Pioneers"" reminded me of the abundance I have in my own life.I will quote some of the notable scenes: The last kid from the team(don't remember his name) is spellbound looking at the cricket team play. What it must be like to discover a new and a bold world!The imposter syndrome in Phiona acknowledged by the Coach saying, ""you belong here"" in the middle of the game. A misfit but not a failure?I also figured one of the crucial issues in nurturing young talent is quality of coaching talent:What would have happened to the kids if their coach had chosen greener pastures as ""Engineering Supervisor"" or had passed them along to a ""big city"" coach who didn't understand them enough. Talent gets ignored because adults are not equipped to guide them right.And then, who could overlook the strength of the mother?
Despite challenges, she refuses to take the easier route of ""sugar daddies"". The film brings up something very motherly: feeling disassociated from a teenager kid who is suddenly too ""champion-y"" to do household chores. Then there's the irony when Phiona wins a ""boy"" for being ""best in boys""""Such aggression in a girl is a treasure"" quite sums up my feeling.Think about it, what should a teenager do when her house is literally getting washed away? Dream of becoming a sports champion or earn enough maize...Which choice makes her answer ""very good"" to the question ""How's your life""...and of course the film is littered with hard to miss naked poverty poring through and tugging at your heartstrings.And the brilliant end where the real people are introduced alongside the actors.We need more.-> More stories of female strength
-> More stories of teenage and young adult role models
-> More stories of triumph over crisesWatch ""Queen of Katwe"" and you will come alive, roaring for your next adventure."
" Based on a true history, showing a true reality
",0.6808,0.9819,2018-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Queen of Katwe is a beautiful movie that invites you to think, to smile, to cry, to feel gratitude and hope. It is one of the best movies I have seen lately. No cliches, spectacular performance from all actors and actresses and a real example of compassion, determination, strength, focus and courage. I wish we could have more movies like this."
" Okay but could have been better
",0.6486,-0.8822,2018-04-24 00:00:00,6,"Based on a true story: Phiona Mutesi (Madina Nalwanga) is a ten-year old living in the slum district of Katwe, Uganda. Through the kind and able mentoring of a local missionary (David Oyelowo), she discovers the joys of chess and realizes a potential that is beyond her life circumstances. ""Queen of Katwe"" is an American film and in the English language.The film's first half is very appealing especially as it exposes class struggle and prejudice in various situations. Phiona is seen as the poorest of the poor when she first learns chess among neigbourhood peers; later, she and her new peers face further barriers and snobbery as their collective and individual talents take them to much higher places. It is more than just a battle against other chess opponents. The bigger battle is the internal voice that says, ""I don't belong here"" when sent to places that radically differ from the Katwe slums.Sadly, the film sags in the second half. It is even more disappointing that the directing is by Mira Nair who has done so well with other films especially ""Monsoon Wedding"" back in 2001. Despite the depth of the inspiring story in the first half, a blandness takes over in the second. This is unfortunate considering the movie's potential. In any case, Oyelowo is moving as the father-like figure - not surprising considering his fine work in ""Selma""."
" Slow but great change of scenery
",0.7684,0.6375,2018-04-20 00:00:00,4,"This is a long movie. 
It seems based on a true story.
The setting is in Africa, which is quite good...in my opinion more movies should come from foreign countries like this.
But to me it was a really slow and boring movie.
Feminists will probably love this film.
Depending on what you are looking for, you might like it...but if you look for action, suspense, thrill....you will be disappointed, in my opinion."
" Not a checkmate
",0.0,0.9366,2018-04-13 00:00:00,5,Mira Nair's Queen of Katwe is one of those inspirational underdog stories set in the slums of Uganda. A feel good triumph over adversity film.Based on true facts it tells the tale of 10 year old Phiona Mutesi who sells maize with her siblings and her devoutly religious single mother Nakku (Lupita Nyong'o.) Phiona may not have a formal education but when she joins a chess club organised by football coach Robert Katende (David Oyelowo.) she shows her competitive and combative spirit as well as a natural talent for chess.The film uses many amateur actors who have a intuitive spark but sometimes lack emotional depth. However the biggest problem was Mira Nair's direction and the script. The film is too long and predictable. For every triumph Phiona has is later met with disaster such as her brother getting involved in a traffic accident.It is a film that follows a formula like it was an IKEA instructional manual for some flat pack furniture.
" Great Disney film
",0.6249,0.9928,2018-02-24 00:00:00,9,"A Disney film that is close to perfection. More satisfying if it matches reality. This is really well done, with real chess moves to make you think, the slum is realistic although maybe too nice to be true, but maybe true, great acting and an incredible beauty for Phiona and her mom, and many others. The acting included the local language, adding another layer of veracity. Great rags to riches story, ideal for Disney. My only bemol: it ends at the riches. Somewhat anticlimactic."

" A life changing game.
",0.0,0.9992,2017-09-24 00:00:00,8,"I am not a big fan of Mira Nair. But I like some of her films, particularly 'Amelia'. Because she usually prefers India and Indian subjects and cast as what she's. Outside that circle, she was not that successful, until now. It was a sport film, that revolved around chess game. Inspired by an incredible true story from the dark continent. It all happened less than ten years ago. Disney and ESPN together produced it. So when these two productions come together, you would know what to expect.Seeing the opening few minutes, it reminded me the recent New Zealand film 'The Dark Horse'. Kind of a similar film, but I was not that impressed with that. But this one was awesome. Simply a miracle. Like any fairy-tale from the Disney. She was not a princess, but in a way she turns to be one. Years ago when I reviewed 'Searching for Bobby Fischer', I said that was the film should be shown in the schools. Now add this title as well to the list.The opening was the ending. Then followed the flashback, which went to the 4 years ago. Living in a slum of Katwe, a single mother raising her children, but not without their contribution to the family. Now the focus shifts to one of the family members, Phiona. Curiosity on her brother who disappears every day after sold out his goods leads her to a new path. That's when she discovers a game she had never heard of before. After learning the basics, she quickly picks up the rest of the game on her own and becomes a prodigy.❝Losing teaches me how to play better.❞This is like most of the true stories you have seen, but that's the truth as well in here. What might come later could impress you. Because it was not like she has a superpower, so she can clear her life path just like that. Honestly, the real test begins now for her, how she uses her gift. But it was her coach who understood the situation, and tried his best to push her further with the big tournaments, in the national and the international level. Not just her, there has been a team behind her. So the remaining is to reveal how far she would go, as well as the story of her struggling family.They have got the cast perfectly. Everyone was brilliant. David Oyelowo was amazing, surely one of my favourite British actors for now. This is the second consecutive time he's making a such impression. Not long ago with 'A United Kingdom'. Definitely the Oscars is just a corner. And then Lupita Nyong'o, she was not the centre of the story, but had enough part and she excelled every bit of it. The rest of the actors, including the one who played Phiona was amazing. At the end credit, both the cinematic and the real life characters appeared. I felt that was a result of excitement, but liked it.The sad part was why such films were ignored at the big stages! This is a must see film, especially if you have a kid(s) in the home, show it to them. Being the parents, uncle and aunt, that's one of the best thing you would do for them. Because no one knows when and where kids gets their confidence boost, inspiration or discovering a new path. You can't compare films with real life, even it was a biopic. But still the true story always remains a true story, even after they're compressed to 120 minutes. Particularly the Disney film gets rid of harsh parts, making a family friendly film. So watch it for a change, you have no other reasons, you could be impressed!8/10"
" Queen of Katwe - Heading Up There with 'Chariots'
",0.0,0.994,2017-09-01 00:00:00,9,"Unexpectedly strong material here. This could be the ""Chariots of Fire"" for the Chess Olympics! - in some ways, it may even be more powerful as its subjects are not the privileged world players but the underdogs who have to fight to etch out a living & a place in the world from devastating poverty. With superb performances from all concerned, great direction by Mira Nair (who earlier turned down a superficial Harry Potter entry to work on 'The Namesake'), marvelous cinematography by American born British D.O.P Sean Bobbitt ('kill the Messenger' '14) captures all the color and emotional power of life amid the grunge in the slums of Uganda.Based on the factual bio of Phiona Mutesi by writer Tim Crothers - it follows her struggles to forge a better life as an international chess champion. The fine screenplay adaptation by William Wheeler maintains a strong measure of the facts, with the featured tournaments gruelingly involving, even exhausting. Her mentor coach Robert Katende, a dedicated missionary with the Pioneers program is marvelously played by David Oyelowo ('Selma' '14). The performance by Lupita Nyongo as Phiona's dedicated and morally committed mother --caught in extreme situations-- is nothing short of inspirational. Music by British born Alex Heffes tops this with a crowning glory. Nothing superficial within this winner. A strong candidate for discerning audiences of most any age group."
" It's a Disney Movie!

The movie is not made for you or your peers. It seems that their complaints and criticizes are irrelevant because they are adults who are thinking and commenting as adults on a children/youth movie. Remember folks, this a Disney movie and its target audiences are not you adults! Ask any teenagers, younger movie-goers, and they would tell you how wonderful this movie is to them. Not only the real and touching acting, the wonderful aesthetic visual elements, the sensitive story-telling way, the emotional and character-building plot, it's also an eye opening for young people in this country to see the unfortunates and their hard life in Africa. It's a teachable moment for our youngs (and olds) of this privileged nation with all the fortune and blessings they take for granted throughout their life."
" Fails to realize its potential.
",-0.4215,0.9984,2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"This is the story of Phiona Mutesi, an accomplished young Ugandan chess player. The story follows the standard script of inspiring sports story where the underdog meets competition and succeeds, but not without overcoming many obstacles. One of the biggest obstacles Phiona had to overcome, and what makes this a remarkable story, is her having been born and raised in Katwe, a slum in the City of Kampala.The dialog offers little by way of surprise. After Phiona loses a crucial match she expresses self-doubt and questions whether she should go on. Interacting with her coach after the loss, in a scene with a strong emotional buildup, her coach delivers the tired line, ""You must never surrender."" I appreciated this having been filmed on location in Uganda. The bright colors are a delight to the eye. The costumes make a vivid impression, from the women's dresses to the more subtle intricate designs and colors of the men's shirts. The little insight into what life looks like in a Kampala slum is something I would never otherwise have gotten. I would like to have seen more of the daily life in Katwe.Using non-professional actors for many of the roles worked two ways for me, it added authenticity at the expense of stilted acting.In all movies ""based on a true story"" I always have a question as to just how many liberties were taken for audience appeal. This movie may have pushed the envelop--it tries to extract every last drop of emotion. The overt attempt to manipulate drains the true emotional content. A little research reveals that Mutesi's chess playing is not of the prodigy caliber as portrayed; her ranking by the World Chess Federation among active players is around 90,000. Her apparent financial success, as represented by her buying a nice house for her mother, could not have come from her chess wins, since any major money from tournament wins is awarded only to the very top players. The celebration of her last win make it look like it was for a national holiday. Is chess really that popular in Uganda? All of the exaggeration is not to take away from Mutesi's achievements that are extraordinary given her background and living conditions.There are lots of chess-related movies out there (Google ""chess movies"") and, of the half dozen or so I have seen, my favorite is ""Searching for Bobby Fischer."""
" Not as good as we expected
",-0.3412,0.0617,2017-07-04 00:00:00,4,We love achievement movies (about sports or any other kind of talent) and we like movies about gifted children and we like chess. So we expected to really enjoy this movie. But it is not too exciting. It was a bit of a let down. And it is too long for the story it has to tell. I wouldn't recommend it.
" A weak script and average acting bring this true story down
",0.09,0.9344,2017-07-02 00:00:00,4,"It's been a long time since I've seen such potent material be hampered so badly by average acting and an equally average script and while Mira Nair's Queen of Katwe still gets extra marks for being such a nice and inspiring true story, this Disney effort feels like a big missed opportunity.Delivering dialogue that's clunky via amateurish acting, scenes that are shoddily edited and placed together and a general feel as though this tale is building up to a moment that never even comes, Katwe squanders the tale of young Ugandan chess master Phiona Mutesi in an overlong film that wants to tug at our heart strings but can't do so due to its execution.Nair is a director with some decent runs on the board with films like The Namesake and Vanity Fair and while Katwe includes notable cast members like Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o and the ever good David Oyelowo, the two performers can't elevate the films supporting cast, made up largely of unknowns and by the end of proceedings it feels as though only Oyelowo walks away with the ability to say he could hold his head up high.It's always harsh to pick on a first time performer as a point of blame but newcomer Madina Nalwanga struggles to bring the difficult role of Mutesi to life and her often emotionally void presence that is bereft of any engaging elements mixed with a disappointing collection of key scenes delivered without an ounce of conviction really kill the chances Nair and her team had of bringing the underdog story of the impoverished and uneducated Mutesi to life, even though the story itself and surrounds of the slums of Uganda hold much life that could've come bursting onto the big screen.Final say – An inspiring true story that's unfortunately told without an ounce of inspiration itself, The Queen of Katwe may appeal greatly to those that count chess as a favourite past time and some die-hard Disney fans but this Disney sports film is easily one of the mouse house's most disappointing feel good sport themed movies in sometime and goes to show that casting and script work makes or breaks movies no matter the foundation.2 smelly chess opponents out of 5"

It shows that we can be intellectuals and champion's. I like how the movie shows the young character who was a great actress started from the slums but fought her way to a better life style even after losing her home. This movie made me emotional and wish I had their type of discipline and understand their struggles. I think this movie was great and everyone should have saw this movie."

" Affirmative action in chess, lol
",0.4215,0.9266,2017-03-31 00:00:00,1,"Hi folks, as some of U know, Disney is notorious for taking an event, and drastically changing and bending what actually occurred, often to the point of making a movie that really has little to do with the event or story they claim to be representing --The actual background for this movie is as followsFIDE awarded Phiona a women's IM title. Their requirements are that a woman must have had a peak rating of at least 2000 elo and scored at least 50% in a qualifying tourney. Apparently they bent the rules a lot to grant Phiona a WIM (women International master) title. Her peak rating was about 1650 elo (350 below the requirement) and she scored only one win (against a 1542 player), three draws and lost three games in the 2012 Olympiad--So this is basically a fiction movie =Its affirmative action in the world of FIDE, I'm sure there are a LOT of chess players fuming over this, I know of at least one young woman who tried to get an WIM in the USA and peaked at around 1950, and was not awarded the title --guess she is in the wrong country --One very good chess movie starring minorities that really is true is called 'Brooklyn Castle', --A very good fiction chess movie is 'Queen to Play', about as true as this movie is when you get right down to it"
" Good, but a few bad scene transitions
",-0.5859,0.9625,2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Movie is done really well. The sets, most of the music, character development, is all good. The only main issue I had with the film was that at about 4-5 different instances in the film, it seemed there was a loss of time or not enough of an explanation of what happened in-between the 2 transitioning scenes. It is able to be assumed or pieced together, but I think a film like this should make sure those scenes join together a lot better than it is. As far as the music, I only had a problem with the music played right at the starting. I thought it should of been more like the African instrumental music that is played later in the film, and not popish."
" Warmly Inspiring
",0.6705,0.9933,2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"An inspiring story of a slum girl who, with coaching, is able to bring out the chess genius in her. Given the opportunity, talents can arise in anyone. The depiction of slums in this film didn't leave much to the imagination. It showed very harsh living conditions and was very realistic. The cast mainly consists of youth, and though their inexperience does show, their portrayals are well done. For her first film, Nalwanga does a good job at displaying tenacity and innocence. Her expressions are natural and she has good chemistry with the other actors and actresses. As a biographical movie, the kids in this film added a sort of purity that helped the movie have a sense of reality. Nyong'o as the mother, and Oyelowo as the coach, also did well at displaying passionate emotions.Location and scene settings help to anchor the story and create the small town feel. The atmosphere that the cinematography brought out was one that was very natural, with slow pans and long shots. Not only does this film tell an inspiring story, it gives a cultural education, shedding some light on slum life in Uganda. The customs of the culture and the way the people express themselves are a great fun to watch. As well, the screenplay did a good job in incorporating the difficulties of a small town girl competing in the big world, as well as displaying cultural sensitivities. Although some scenes are just slow in developing, and some issues seem to be repetitive, this film is overall, is a great portrayal of an inspiring story."

I found myself falling in love with the Ugandan people and cheering for the Queen as she struggled to climb out of the slums of Uganda and to overcome her perception that she was somehow unworthy of being part of the world outside. It's easy to put yourself into her place, to feel the struggle at each step of progress and feel the pain of her setbacks. Then it peaks at the heart-stopping moment when the coach pushes her to the top with ""you belong here!"" It's a message that will stay with me.This movie is for anyone who dreams of a better life. No matter who you are, you can achieve your goals if you try hard enough and you don't give up. Fantastic message."
" Forward Move
",0.0,0.997,2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,"There are so many movies released each year that a number are left behind when it comes to box office glory. This is not to say the movies are bad movies, just that they are overlooked for various reasons. Some are missed because they don't have the star power of other films. Some are missed because of the sheer mass of hits released that same week. Some are missed because of more blockbuster titles coming out at the same time. QUEEN OF KATWE falls into that last category, not only at the theater but on disc as well. With both JACK REACHER and INFERNO coming out at the same time many may miss this movie. That's a shame.Based on a true story the movie tells the tale of Phiona Mutesi (Madina Nalwanga), a young girl growing up in the slums of Katwe in Uganda. Phiona's life is hard. Her father died when she was young and her mother Nakku Harriet (Lupita Nyong'o) is struggling to keep the family together and to provide for them. Living in a shack and subsisting on selling maize she gets on credit, Harriet and her family spend most of their time just trying to live.10 year old Phiona's life completely changes when she meets Robert Katende (David Oyelowo), an instructor in charge of a missionary project that reaches out to children and teaches them chess. Fascinated by the game Phiona and her brother begin to show each day to the mission, both to get something to eat and to play the game.When Harriet learns of what the two have been doing she is angered. People have been telling her that this is a gambling den with people betting on games. It takes some convincing by Katende to convince her otherwise and to tell her just how good her children are at the game. She allows them to return and Phiona begins to flourish. Katende begins to recognize the skill and ease with which Phiona plays. He sees that she has the ability to be a grandmaster, someone who can see moves in advance before the pieces on the board are even moved.Eventually Katende brings several of the best students to compete in a regional contest. There they encounter prejudice, and not a white/black style we are used to seeing but a class prejudice between the well-dressed students from various schools to these street urchins with nothing. Their smug attitude is erased when Phiona wins the championship.The film follows the ups and downs of the lives of Phiona and her family from there. Will she be able to move forward, to be provided the opportunity to progress and become the champion that Katende sees in her? Will her mother be able to provide for the family and keep them together? And will the youngsters of one of the poorest slums in the world find hope in the moves of chess pieces in the hands of young Phiona? The movie revolves around several stories all going on at once. The center piece is of course that of Phiona and her natural ability to play chess. Her story also revolves around her growing up as the years pass and of her dedication and wish for more for her family. That brings out the second story going on here, that of her mother. A strong willed women determined to hold her family together at all costs. She's lost her husband and one child already. Is she willing to do anything to retain her family now? And lastly there is the story of Katende, a man who wants to teach these children and to help them rise above the poverty and squalor that they have no choice but to live in.The movie is an uplifting tale that will cause the viewer consider life as we know it. If you own a DVD player and are watching the movie in a home with a roof, heat or air conditioning you are so far advanced from the people in this story you are watching. If you don't count your blessings while watching then there is something far too cold within you. It helps you to appreciate what you have and to wish the same for others.The story raises you as you witness a young woman determined to move up in life by moving game pieces on a board. Chess is more than a simple game. It involves strategy, attention and skill. The side by side stories of Phiona and Harriet show them both using what skills they have and learn to move and advance their pieces forward, in Phiona's case those on the board and in Harriet's the lives of her family. Both are skilled at what they do and have the potential to achieve their goals, moving one piece at a time. In the end you will find yourself cheering both Phiona and Harriet on in their struggles. And you will wish that more could find a way to achieve their goals as well."

I love true stories, and movies about an underprivileged child finding a way to improve her life are usually wonderful and inspiring. This movie is no exception. The story really sucks you in and you connect with Phiona in a way you don't with many characters and find yourself actively rooting for her. The acting is really good but the drama and heart is the real reason to watch this. I highly recommend this and its a great family movie. It is a little too Disney at some points, but in a movie like this that is not a bad thing. Overall, inspiring and one I highly recommend.

But patience and learning how to take losses are two skills Nalwanga needs to learn, or else she'll risk burning out and quitting before she reaches her goals.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Queen Of Katwe"" is the scene when Nalwanga and the other slum, chess students are put against the rich ""city boys"" of Uganda in a chess tournament.

The educational stake of the movie destroyed any sense of naturalness of the way characters act and talk. Queen of Katwe resembles the propaganda movies for children I saw in the communist regime in my childhood in Romania. One detail: the children's acting is atrocious, which is surprising for me, after watching many Iranian and Turkish low-budget movies with children playing with great ingenuity, spontaneity and talent. Psychologically, it is perhaps easier for a child to assume a movie persona than for an amateur adult. So, you need a very bad director for such a counter performance."
" Rather weird for a biography
",-0.1779,-0.9576,2017-01-19 00:00:00,5,"Queen of Katwe seems to be half a (board) game anime and half an African melodrama movie. The training arc, games and opponents have a very Japanese anime style in them from expressions to execution. The creator of this movie has most likely been watching anime series such as Hikaru no Go and Chihayafuru and been inspired by them because the similarities are so easily notable. It is quite weird indeed. The other weird part of this movie are the characters. They yell and cry - much like anime characters- and on top of that there don't seem to be everything else in the world for them except the chess. In one scene mc is crying hysterical -like they do in melodrama- and at the same time she is called mentally strong. This makes no sense, but it is just another reason why it seems more like anime than a biography. Maybe her life is anime. Yet another reason to call this weird is that it is quite weird that this movie was ever even made. Biography movies often aren't about no-name personas. Our main character is not best chess players in Africa, not the best female player in the world nor can she beat any of the leading male players in the world. Rather than being a world wide sensation, she seems to be ""a local hero"" at the best. I guess we can call them localization problems. To continue with the weird stuff. This isn't any more interesting than a document about a rank 2000-ish League of Legends player. And that's why my rating is uninteresting/10."
