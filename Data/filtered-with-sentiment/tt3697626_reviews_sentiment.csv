" Wonderful...
",0.0,0.9436,2021-04-08 00:00:00,9,"Guys, the Koreans definitely know how to make films that leave us mesmerized, we even hold our breath so as not to disturb the concentration and not affect the evil adventures of the protagonist, fun, absurd, charming, tense, it was several difficult days, I loved the tightness that the protagonist gone, no matter how much we know about his mistakes, we change them to make it work, but only so that he can screw himself with mastery in the end. And what a development, intelligent, wonderful script..."
" Full of excitement and tension
",0.2263,0.9152,2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,"I liked it very much, it was more amazing and extraordinary than I expected. I guess I put it in the top 3 among all the Korean movies I have watched, maybe 5, not to be precise. Still, it was great."
" Would be a great film if it weren't for some completely unnecessary unrealistic plot holes/story decisions
",0.6249,-0.8002,2021-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Would be a great film if it weren't for some completely unrealistic plot holes/story decisions which were unnecessary. Namely theres a scene when a tiny kids toy pulls an entire dead mans body weight through a vent then literally the next scene shows how much a grown human man was struggling to carry it. Also a scene where an entire van blows up with a man in it, the van flips over a few times and into a lake but we see that man walk out barely unscathed in the next scene. Both these parts of the story just made the film feel more cheap and weren't necessary to the plot at all so its a shame that these scenes were hard to get passed and made the film just feel cheap"
" Must Watch Movie For Action And Thriller Lovers
",0.5859,0.8712,2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,It keeps on the hook. You will throughly enjoy it. Must give it try and you won't regret it especially for thriller lovers.
" Pure Entertainment
",0.4215,-0.4211,2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"This film is probably a one watch movie but it's so good.The dark comedy and action are perfect.I love the way the main character isn't a good guy, he just a not as bad guy. And the main villain as amazing.There's one minor flaw in the film, that made me say yeah right. I won't bring it up so if you don't care you won't notice it.The climax of the movie is one of the most authentic fight scenes you'll ever see.I was totally gripped throughout and would recommend this film to anyone"
" World Class Actor with a World Class Result
",0.0,0.8736,2021-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Lee Sun Kyun really is a world class actor. He could play as a dirty cop in this movie, then a very patient person ini My Myster, and then a cocky big boss in Parasite.
A Hard Day really exploits acting skill of Sun Kyun. We could feel how depressive his situation is. The movie really centralized in Sun Kyun character. All other actors are like only supporting role. I also love the pace of this movie. For me it feels like medium pace, not too slow but not to fast either. Some parts even feels like Tarantino's style. My favorite director."
" My Favorite Cop Movie! Perfect!
",0.8065,0.9217,2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Brilliantly edited and directed. This is a cop movie, not a detective movie. But boy is it great!Lee Sun-Kyun, a police detective working out of a thoroughly corrupt department, starts the roller coaster ride in the first scene by making a bad decision that defines the rest of the movie. That action instantly sets in motion one nail-biting confrontation after another. Some darkly funny. Others just dark. Yet it manages to blend them while keeping its identity and pace. And just when you think that the plot has been established to a point that the rest of the movie can coast to a resolution, a new twist emerges that makes you shake your head and say: ""I...did...not...see...that...coming."" What's amazing is that the plot twists continue right up to the last scene. It's just incredibly entertaining.This movie is so well put together and cast that I can't see it being improved upon. I hope Hollywood leaves it alone."
" Suspenseful Thriller couldn't get any better
",-0.2514,0.8402,2020-12-30 00:00:00,9,Such a great film... Watched this film in 2015. Loved it very much
" what a movie
",0.0,0.372,2020-11-03 00:00:00,8,"I love 'domino tiles' movies when one mistake leads to a bigger one and the main character tries to get hold of the situation but he just worsens it and continues making even bigger and graver mistakes. This movie is pretty much like that. The main guy didn't want to face the consequences of his fault so everything goes downhill.
There were very unexpected turns and scenes where you would have thought, I know what happens next but then something very different occurred.
It's a very entertaining movie, worth watching."
" It's really really a hard day
",-0.2433,-0.2433,2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,As my title. It's really really a hard day for the lead
" Non stop thrills
",0.0772,0.8501,2020-07-25 00:00:00,6,"It is ranked among the top Korean thrillers of this decade, both critically and commercially.Because of its screenplay's breakneck pace, unpredictable twists and believable and far from likeable characters, with broad strokes of grey. And also because of the too notch acting by the two leads and the director's dark sense of humor.There is a small blip in believability, around the end, which left me slightly less impressed.Would recommend this to all thriller junkies. Would leave your pulse pounding for most of its runtime and thoroughly entertained."
" Absolutely Entertaining
",0.4927,0.6486,2020-07-22 00:00:00,10,Korean movies are the best when it comes to Thrillers. The movie kept me on the edge all the time. My rating 10/10
" Pathetic Main Character
",-0.5719,-0.6062,2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,"I really wanted to like A Hard Day, just like I tried my hardest to like the main character, detective Go Geon-soo who ruined the film completely. Unfortunately he's a very unlikeable character, who is badly acted. Go Geon-soo is not only dishonest and dodgy, but also spineless. A continuous coward throughout the film. I just couldn't believe once that he was a homicide detective for over 10 years. Really disappointing,Hanzo"
" Another Engaging,nail Biting korean thriller,much much better then my Expectation
",0.4404,0.8519,2020-05-31 00:00:00,10,"Few days before watched this movie with no Expectation but was surprisingly Exceptional,movie with Refreshing ,different storyline full of twist & turn also will hook u edge on ur seat whole time,,,,, direction,Script was outstanding acting was great by all cast Especially Sun-kyun Lee( lead) & negative guy
A must watch movie"
" Wonderful movie
",0.5719,0.7041,2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,The movie is awesome and I didn't get bore watching this movie
" i have a good end idea
",0.4404,-0.8157,2020-04-10 00:00:00,6,"The Korean movies still need some logic, a little bit of logic can make the movie a legend, the story was good, there is an expected event at all, but we need some clarification about main characters stories, I mean before the accident we need to know what happened we see only one view only our main character, also what about the police car which pass after the accident what its role why the director didn't use it and there is no clarification about why it takes the strange road at this time, why also the police car didn't care about the stopped car of the police officer at this part of the night, also I have a good end idea why not be the dangerous bank at the movie only trap or a cell to which may kidnap this officer on it, any way we can say its funny thriller movie"
" One of my favorite Korean films
",0.4588,0.7003,2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,"A Hard Day is a well-crafted action thriler, plenty with both cop-movie conventions and jaw-dropping twists and turns. With its efficient score and awe-inspiring cinematography, it is a pleasurable two-hour rollercoaster ride."
" A.C.A.B. ?!
",0.0,0.5312,2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"A Hard Day is very entertaining and worth a watch if you like South Korea cinema.
The story have alot of interesting and unique characters and a awesome led performance in Lee Sun-kyun, the script is very sharp and the direction is great but where it all falls down to me is the last 20 minutes (after the river standoff) of the movie is so dumb and don't make any sense to me and that's unfortunate to me because the movie was so good up to that point."
" ACTION
",0.0,0.3612,2020-02-05 00:00:00,10,"Storyline is a1, the acting a1, the fights a1. Korean movies prove once again to be the best."
" Go and watch, you wont regret it!
",0.3867,0.9545,2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,The story its so thrilling but fun in the dark comedy i love it to the end
" What a special treat of a film!!!
",0.7412,0.97,2019-04-22 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those very rare films where literally every second is interesting. Captivating from the opening scene, the film grabs you and never lets go. So much happened within the first twenty minutes of the film, you can't help but root for our hero, Ko Gun-Soo, excellently played by Sun-kyun Lee. I rooted for this poor character every step of the way!The plot thickened by the minute, but hey, this is one of those films where you can't say too much in order not to spoil it. This is one you simply have to see. The film becomes more thrilling and suspenseful as it progresses and some of the action and fighting scenes are truly brilliant. What an absolute treat! Bloody hell, this was awesome!!"
" wonderful
",0.5719,0.6098,2019-02-20 00:00:00,7,"The twists and turns of the story are matched by the conflict of the plots in place, with a relaxed and moderate rhythm. Traveling clouds and moving water tell the story of small fish eating big fish. Deeply speaking, what is the end of corruption and how to ensure that justice is not tempted and polluted by evil?"
" Good
",0.4404,0.1779,2018-12-30 00:00:00,5,It's a movie full of twists and suspense. A Hard Day ends up occupying the same mix of action and humor
" One Of The Best Movies I've Seen in a long time!
",0.6696,0.9908,2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,"Undoubtedly one of the best crime & exciting movie I've seen in a while. Among English, spanish, tamil movies I normally watch, as a sri lankan. Lots of people have commented their feelings but for me, who is a huge fan of dark comedies & also mind blowing films, this was a gem in both segments as well.Another Aspect is From The very first second the film starts to the very end of the film, you literally just can't take your eyes off. It keeps your Interest right from the word go & every second we are waiting to see what happens next. I Haven't experienced that in many other so called best films of all time. I understand that - but in this film, it was a special characteristic.I Normally don't give films 10 out of 10, because nothing's perfect on this world, but still.... This movie was as entertaining as I would have expected to be. I'm defiantly Admire Korean films now."
" A Hard Day Review: Not at all hard to like at once!
",0.3995,0.9943,2017-11-11 00:00:00,10,"Movie: A Hard Day (15)Rating: 5/5This is one of the most tightly scripted action thrillers from South Korea. No doubt why it won so much acclaim all over. The script is quite new and refreshing, and it makes for a perfect watch. In other words, the film is a perfect masterpiece because it easily manages to engage and absorb you in its atmosphere, and it's a film which is very easily likable. A HARD DAY is perfectly scripted, rather so much that you won't get deviated from watching the film, and if some interruption happens between watching it, you might even get angry and start shouting. It's one of those films which don't let you move. Even if you move, you will not feel good to leave it. That's why I finished it in just one viewing. Director Seong-hun Kim has done a marvellous job as he handles both the direction as well as writing departments in a very professional manner. He has done his best in telling the story with full force, and has provided plenty of entertaining elements to keep you engrossed. Sun-Kyun Lee is an actor to watch out for. His performance creates a strong impact and after a point it doesn't seem he's acting at all. It's a natural act by him. Another round of applause to Cho Jin-woong: he's menacing at times and his performance is quite effective. Same for the rest of the cast.The thrills are quite chilling and the action, superb. The cinematography is excellent in many shots, especially the action scenes. The background score is quite pulsating and increases the excitement from time to time. That said, A HARD DAY is a mindblowing action thriller which has plenty of surprises to offer to viewers, especially those expecting just another action or thriller film. It's something you won't have seen before, and this film undoubtedly increases the respect for South Korean cinema in my eyes."
" First Half of the Movie is Extremely Slow.
",0.0,0.4404,2017-10-21 00:00:00,6,"Extremely slow start at the beginning of the movie. I thought that the main character was ""Unlikeable"" at the beginning. . . . The movie finally changed after 56 minutes in, when the main villain shows up. After the evil villain appeared, the main character became more Likable, because I felt sorry for him. The movie sped up during its second half, and there were more action and suspense to it. The movie was good overall, but I wish that the first half of the movie was done better."
" Captivating thriller with dark humour n good amount of action. Korean action/thrillers r really awesome.
",0.8955,-0.4924,2017-07-12 00:00:00,9,"Saw this on a DVD two years back. The film is pure entertainment from start to finish. It is nail bitingly tense n action packed. There is dark humour n good acting. One of the best part was the crispy editing which made the movie a fast paced thriller. Awesome direction too, as the movie is very captivating n has lots of twists and turns. The movi is about a detective who is having a very hard day. His mother has died, he killed a pedestrian while speeding his car, internal affairs is investigating him for corruption n they want to check his car in which he has hidden the dead body, his colleagues ain't happy with him, he's having trouble finding time to spend with his daughter after his divorce, and his sister is on his back. After clearing all the mess, he is engaged in a cat and mouse game of blackmail by somebody who claims that he saw the detective bumping off the pedestrian."
" A solid South-Korean crime thriller
",-0.3612,0.9862,2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,I read a couple reviews where they mention it's also a comedy where you will have good laughs. I can assure you there is absolutely nothing to laugh with in this movie. It's not a comedy and I don't get why people would write such things. But it's certainly not a bad movie. It's a movie full of twists and suspense. A crime thriller that will entertain you from the first till the last second. It deserves a solid seven stars rating and I would even score it a bit higher if it was not for that terrible language that is Korean. I wonder if they think the same about our languages. Well at least that's my point of view about Korean. It just sounds like they are always mad when they speak. It's not the first South-Korean movie I saw and it won't be the last. They make really good movies and I will just get over it that I don't like their language. The cast is also good. Sun-kyun Lee is a good actor as well as the others. I wouldn't read too much about it before watching it so the story won't get spoiled.
" it's been a gritty day's night
",0.0,-0.517,2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"""Kkeutkkaji ganda"" (""A Hard Day"" in English) is the first Kim Seong-hun movie that I've seen. What a shocker. I've heard some about rampant corruption in South Korea, but if this movie is any indication, things can get REALLY ugly. The main character is Ko, a crooked detective who accidentally kills someone while driving drunk. But after he covers up the killing, he finds out that there was more to this man than he realized, and that someone might have seen him.The setting is not identified, as if to say that this could be the sort of thing that happens everywhere in the country. Ko is already the venal type, but once he covers up the manslaughter, he finds himself surrounded by some of the sleaziest elements in society. Almost every scene contains a surprise, especially towards the end. My favorite scenes were in the funeral home, and by the lake. But every scene has something in store.The movie got screened at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival at the Director's Fortnight sidebar. I think that it should've won something. It's one of the cleverest movies that I've seen. Definitely see it.PS: The Korean title translates to ""Take It to the End""."
