" Better than this rating of 5.5
",0.4404,0.9622,2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,"So this is my first review ever on here, although I go look at this site for every movie I watch to see my thoughts vs others. I'm compelled to review this one. I gave it a solid 7. I'm a horror movie fan. I have seen this movie several times. It lives up to my expectations. It's fun, campy, scary, a little gory...everything you want in a solid scary movie. At first I was annoyed that I had to keep reading the texts, emails, etc but towards the end I think that's what made it so good. It was unique, and interesting way to make a movie, had that realistic effect I.e. Blair Witch or the ""true video"" type movies. Obviously the acting is subpar and all that, but this wasn't made to be Oscar bait. It's fun and different and worth the little over an hour time. This movie is kind of a precursor to the movie Searching in the way it was made, which is also a great ""reality"" scary movie. Don't come in with unrealistic expectations and you will like it."
" Actually pretty good

" something unique and new
",0.0,-0.7348,2021-03-11 00:00:00,7,"I am amazed by the idea, new type of horror and thriller, and professional showoff of various internet phenomena like cyber bullying, chatting, forums, news... That was so new and unique, whole movie happening in front of monitor or display, and using all the new current stuff. It is interesting because it can be understood by all people who understand internet, especially younger. Reminds me of personal issues with stalking, threats, chats, news, forums, computer viruses... Everything looks real, serious, funny, interesting...except the killing itself, it just looks too extreme and unrealistic, without explanation how could somebody be at the same time at many places. Also unrealistic inability of anyone to get out of home or turn off computer by force. And bit unexplained, with missed many details, explanations, reasons. Most is unfortunately pure talk. I expected more and better intro, outro, places, science, solutions. Also minus for the negative ending. But plus for something unique, new, innovative, serious, realistic topic, the problem of weaknesses of people's psyche, and of vulnerabilities of people on Internet, computer, phone. So good, but not perfect. Recommended for technology and new age lovers."

" Familiar material is given a spin with modern technology to (mostly) successful results
",0.5859,-0.9947,2021-02-26 00:00:00,6,"Over the course of a video chat, a malevolent unseen caller subjects a group of teens to increasingly horrific scenarios on the anniversary of the death of cyber-bullying victim Laura Barnes who may or may not be the caller.Produced by Timur Bekmambetov and Blumhouse, the movie is yet another modestly budgeted horror film with the same low risk high reward approach taken by their franchises Paranormal Activity and Insidious. Unfriended is notable for being the first major release of a desktop film, wherein actions are presented on and from the point of view of a computer screen. While Unfriended isn't the first film to utilize this approach, it was the first to introduce the storytelling format to a wide audience as opposed to the rather niche products previously associated with the format. While the film is well made and has some good scares as well as an admirable moral stance on cyberbullying, it's also going to be very familiar to horror fans who know the story beats involving a group of teenagers coming face to face with a malevolent force.Unfriended is at its core what many critics colloquially refer to as a ""dead teenager movie"" where a group of teenage ""types"" consisting of good girl, fat comic relief, aggressive alpha male, ""nice guy"", etc.) are all picked off one by one as the movie goes from point A to point B. It's a well worn format and it's put to reasonably good effect here, but it also has the same problem that many of today's movies of this ilk have where the cast is filled with characters written to be unlikable and reprehensible so we, the audience, want to see them killed. Admittedly the movie is more self aware of this issue than many modern movies of this ilk as its characters inherently despicable nature is used to build itself towards its climax and the underlying social horror that is arguably more frightening than the supernatural happenings, but the characters are still front and center for much of the films running time so not only are they unpleasant but we get to experience all aspects of it first hand.With that said however, the film more often succeeds than it flounders. Aside from a few hiccups (such as an unintentionally humorous/data use of Chatroullette of all things) the movie does seem to have a firm grasp of contemporary technology and how integrated it is in our lives. The usage of various applications, social media sites, and other tech features feel well integrated into the narrative and are all well utilized to build towards the films chilling final moments. Once the obligatory establishment of character is out of the way the movie spends the rest of the time putting these horrible people through mental and physical punishment as it shines light on their most shameful secrets and destroys the ""friendships"" of these people who were never truly friends. The ending is also quite fittingly bleak where it leaves us, with the exception of a stinger that has found itself overused since the first Paranormal Activity drove it into the ground upon initial introduction.Unfriended is not a a great horror film, but it is a good horror film. At a brisk running time it never drags and it has more of a head on its shoulders about this topic than many similar films. While the characters are unlikable by design they do serve the purpose of the movie's point and for the most part Unfriended successfully tackles contemporary issues with a supernatural twist."
" Different but nothing special
",-0.438,-0.0447,2021-02-22 00:00:00,4,They were trying for something different here but the acting and parts of the story were not great. Could've been so much better.
" BEWARE OF DARK WEB!!!
",0.0,-0.9796,2021-02-08 00:00:00,6,"Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uppsala University, University of Dhaka- these websites are called SURFACE WEB. According to Traversals, Surface Webs are only 5 percent among the World Wide Web layers. 95% have no traceability. This layer is divided into two: Deep Web (password-protected websites, e.g., digital library) and Dark Web (hidden websites). Anybody can't access to the DARK WEB, rather there are gateways to penetrate there. DARK WEBS are, the heaven of hackers. To my concern, hackers are the MOST GENIOUS PERSONS in the present times who could make the entire websystem dancing on their own tunes.
These film series are made on the basis of how HACKERS could turn anybody's life into hell. Everybody's life has dark secrets and darkweb specialists know about it. So, people shouldn't tease other's limitations, shortcomings and weak points. Bullying may lead to suicidal acts of innocent lives. But, those who do bullying or stealing others' stuff, may be getting punished by unknown figures (hackers) who are untraceable.
Both films portrayed group of friends who engage in a group chat and one by one, all group members became victims of the hackers. But, those victims had dark secrets which were hidden. But, hackers unearthen those facts before killing them"
" Dial-up was the scariest part...
",0.0,0.8535,2021-02-06 00:00:00,4,"I think the execution of this movie was really well done! Emails, Facebook profiles and messages, Skype, etc, were all realistic, but not exactly immersive. I appreciated that as the plot progressed we come to find out that all the characters are bad people, but felt that I ultimately lacked any emotional investment in them because of it. I also felt it was longer than it needed to be, but thought the pace of it all was alright. Didn't find it especially entertaining, so probably better for a group watch with friends than a solemn, solo viewing."
" Ran out of steam
",0.0,-0.3299,2021-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Started really well, and was genuinely disturbing for a while. But it was unable to sustain the tension. Host is a similar film, and much better done, and that's partly because it was shorter, and knew when to stop."

" Silliness.
",-0.2263,-0.7264,2020-12-15 00:00:00,3,What a bunch of unbelievable silliness. Really ridiculous plotline with no conceivable connection to reality. The only redeeming factors is there are a couple of funny death scenes. That's about it. 3/10

" Before Host, there was Unfriended
",0.0,0.7622,2020-11-03 00:00:00,8,"A mean spirited, but often intense thriller, Unfriended doesn't quite meet the potential of scares it could have had, but proves to work as a horror film and a drama rather consistently. Before this years supernatural online thriller Host there was this film, and although Host is obviously the better choice, Unfriended truly doesn't deserve the hate it often gets, much of it resulting from its poor marketing campaign. It isn't flashy or anything even new I suppose, besides the whole setup of things being on Skype and Facebook, but it makes due with what it has to make an intense, entertaining, and interesting thriller. Some things I didn't like about the film have to be that it cut the scars really every time, leaving us with only fragments of what was really happening. Like I get they wanted to be mysterious and all, but it just feels unsatisfying. As for the whole setup, that being a spirit haunting these friends because they were all involved in their friends suicide, I felt elements of that were incredibly mean spirited. I mean, I get we needed to know what happened, but really did we need to see the girl literally kill herself at the beginning? Not only is it too much, but it seems incredibly dramatic, which not only seems crude and insensitive, but ultimately incredibly unrealistic. I felt the film had some decent performances, some grounded dialogue and conversations, as well as some situations in general. It's not an easy film to sit through, but it certainly isn't by any means terrifying. It's a consistent thriller with some good moments, good elements, and an intriguing premise. It's not perfect, but more often than not, it is effective.
My Rating: 8.25/10"

Let me start by saying, I am not into social media in any way,which made the 1st 20 minutes pretty unbearable. Plus with the constant glitching,it made it difficult to stay in the moments of tension. I will say it was very satisfying watching horrible teens get their up and comings"

" Could have been great

" Decent flick, not the greatest horror movie ever
",-0.0951,-0.4352,2020-10-04 00:00:00,5,"Originally gave this a 7, in 2017 for my 31 Days of horror. However rewatching it, I definitely wouldn't say it was that good, more of a 5.This is fairly decent movie, not the best of it's kind. I liked how we're introduced to the leads and they're friends. The whole premise behind the haunted social media is just funny, the ghost wants revenge because she killed herself. The reason she shot herself was because she pooed herself at a party, see ridiculous.Saying that though, it's still a decent way to pass time just not the greatest movie ever. Probably really cheap as well given the amount of companies that had advertising in this."
" Deserved it's ""Most Innovative"" win!
",0.8207,0.9759,2020-09-24 00:00:00,6,"Communicating very much through the medium of online chat, the changes in a person's feelings and intentions with each new piece of information they receive was so beautifully documented in the lead character's preparation of messages by typing, deleting, typing before sending. By this means, we were given clues that the other characters did not get. Our imaginations are fired and although we never really find out everything, we don't really need to. We know wrong was done and it was avenged.I'm not a fan of teen slasher movies but I really enjoyed this one, particularly from the technology aspect and the subtlety of the filling. Really well done to all involved. Competent acting and good camera work, great edition. Much better than I expected, too."
" Great film but weird
",0.128,-0.9934,2020-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Hi i really enjoy the film but i find it so weird , i mean its impossible for a ghost to do all that and kill each one so fast
what is she .. the flash lol
i have worked it out on what it's about
bullies being a bully to a class mate and she kills herself through a video
so she comes back from the dead to kill her bully's
wth ... she's a ghost and for starters ghosts can't use computers or hack and another what i find weird is she goes to each home so fast in one shot
how is that possible and another thing about the ghost .. when she is posting on fb all her killings
why hasn't the people noticed online that a ghost is using social media instead they comment on the posts and pictures and haven't twigged that the ghost posted from her account
if it was me on their friend list and i was browsing my fb and saw that
i be like hang on a min .. didn't she dieyeah but i still enjoy watching it .. but it's just too weird and impossible for a ghost to do all that
i'm sorry but i have never heard anything like a ghost doing all that unless she's turned into a demon lol"

It works better if it's a person and not her ghostly entity, because that's not coherent or tangible and there's realism in this story. They may not necessarily be likable characters, but they're believable and that's incredibly important in this modern setting. The ending's odd, I mean they know everything else why wouldn't you assume they know who posted it and saying he did it, goes against the game. A few negatives; Blaire can see already this account will be in the chat before she connects, the flickering and flashes degrade it also."

I was literally sitting up in bed, unable to move my eyes from the screen, I just found it so thrilling. Some of the acting is a bit off and that's why it doesn't get a 10 from me. I found it exiting, clever and original. I'm off to watch the sequel now"

" At least they can say they did this first, better movies like this will be coming
",0.6597,-0.975,2020-06-09 00:00:00,4,"The concept of Unfriended is not bad, and seems particularly relevant nowadays when video-conferencing of this type has become so commonplace. I like the fact that we are basically just watching it all happen as if we are the protagonist looking at her screen, and we follow the story based on what she does with different programs and websites. However, it was strange when everything went silent in the middle of a group video chat so the main girl could have a text conversation or look up some information. It's a lazy choice that they probably made to avoid writing time-killing dialogue to fill every minute, and also because they didn't trust that we could read something on screen if we were distracted with people talking. I also have a feeling this film will not age well at all, because even now the appearance of some of the websites looks a bit outdated, and the functionality of this kind of conference calling is much different with modern apps. Oh, and one more thing that felt outdated, do teenagers have printers in their rooms?!?Having a vengeful spirit interacting with the characters through their computers is good groundwork for a horror film. It can be a bit creepy when technology doesn't perform as expected, or when you feel like you're being watched by someone you don't know online. There's also an added level of helplessness when characters are forced to watch awful things happening while they are in different homes and can't get to their friends. The sad thing is almost all the kills in the film are lackluster and kind of stupid. They also used static distortion on the screen or had video lag, to obscure some of the violence, or artificially create tension. The other problem that Unfriended suffers from is bad acting. These kids are not great, and they are particularly awful at selling the casual dialogue we must sit through before they realize something bad is happening. While I still applaud the originality of the concept presented in Unfriended, they simply didn't make it come together into a good film. I suspect in this day and age we'll see more experimentation with this idea, and it should get better."

" Interesting method of storytelling, marred by a terrible script
",-0.1027,-0.9958,2020-05-13 00:00:00,4,"Let me start off by saying that Unfriended was not the worst found footage movie I've ever seen (sorry, Paranormal Activity, but opening a door once every half hour isn't interesting). Nothing about it offensively bad, and there were moments where I was really interested in what was happening. Unfortunately, it has one, big problem.But first, let's start with the basic premise. On the anniversary of fellow classmate Laura Barnes' suicide, friends Blaire, Mitch, Jesse, Adam, Ken, and Val are having a Skype chat. That is until they notice Laura's Skype account has joined the call. After a series of seemingly supernatural events controlled by Laura, the friends are forced to reveal dark secrets to stay alive.Let's start with the positives. The film's greatest strengths are some of the basic ideas of elements presented in the movie. For instance, the idea of an entire movie from the perspective of a computer screen is fascinating, and could yield some juicy drama and tension. 'Another great idea was where later in the film, Mitch threatens to leave the call and thereby basically give himself to Laura, unless Blaire shows him a piece of paper sent to her by Laura. Problem is, the paper reads ""If you reveal this note, Adam will die."" So Blaire s caught in a dilemma; Should I let my boyfriend possibly die? Or should I basically murder my friend instead? Yes, the answer may be a bit obvious, but with a bit of tweaking the film could really have something. The final good element I'll bring up here is the underlying subtext. Basically, the film's only real ""theme"" is to not cyber bully people. It's a relevant message that, while basic, is always welcome.Unfortunately, the film somewhat squanders the perspective's potential by having the Skype videos annoyingly messed up in way way or another. Look, I get that the video corruption is spooky or whatever, but constant frame rate drops? Is that really necessary? Further damage to this idea is the fact that it's... well, not very interesting at times. Watching someone take full minutes to type a simple response is not agonizing, but also not remotely enjoyable. Oh, and the moral dilemma mentioned above? The problem is that what's on the page is only revealed to us when Blaire shows everyone it. So the whole time, we're completely with Mitch and want Blaire to show the note. It's a poor combination of ideas that was a real missed opportunity. Finally, while the idea was nice, the depiction of cyber bullying is completely unrealistic. Would anyone ever title a video ""LAURA BARNES KILL URSELF"" in the real world? Ever? Instead of addressing the actual problems cyber bullied people face, the film just takes cheap shortcuts that greatly diminish realism in favor of obviousness. This could have been a real opportunity to explore ideas of bullying, and guilt, and the harmful side of internet culture, but no. Instead we have someone naming an account ""Laura Exposed"" with somehow nobody feeling bad for her pre-suicide.Finally, we come to the main problem with Unfriended; the script. To start with, the dialogue is ridiculous. At first, I wanted to fault the actors, but with lines like these I don't blame them for not doing battle. When your script calls for seductively using a knife to threaten your girlfriend into taking her shirt off, I won't blame you for doing so lifelessly and without any care in the movie itself. Next, the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense in certain parts. And I wont talk about the minor stuff (it makes pretty much zero sense that Blaire cheats on Mitch with Adam, since Mitch is, like, fifty million times hotter than him). The most egregious part plot-wise in the film is the ending. It comes down to Mitch and Blaire having to admit that they uploaded and filmed the embarrassing video that caused Laura's suicide. But for some reason neither of them are willing to do it. By this point, they've seen all their other friends be murdered by this ghost, so why must they be so resistant to admitting the truth if they n their lives are on the line? I get that it's hard for them to admit or whatever, but if I had to confess my darkest secrets to live, I'd do it. But no, they must refuse to confess so that they can all die, because reasons. And don't even get me started on the attempts at scariness in this film. No amount of teenagers screaming can convince me that that blender scene isn't ridiculous.Is Unfriended a terrible film? No. Some of the ideas were clever, and you do feel some sense of sympathy for Mitch and Blaire. But conversely, nobody in the film talks like a human being, it's not scary, and every five minutes or so there's a pretty sizable plot hole. If you're looking for a cheap horror movie that has some interesting ideas and weak jump scares, go for it. But if you're looking for an interesting character drama full of frights and good writing, look elsewhere."
" Constant screceching and dumb decisions
",-0.5106,-0.8631,2020-05-09 00:00:00,3,"I'll start of by saying I give this movie huge respect for doing something differently. A film just from the desktop of a computer, a super good idea and at times it does work. However unfortunately this movie is really plain stupid at points. Simplely if you know anything about computer it's just not how they work. All the characters have stupid motivation and you can't really sorry for any of them by the end of the movie. The constant screaming from the middle of movie onwards just makes it painful to watch. Overall the film just seems to pass you by and feels flat. This movie really could have done decently. If you wake up and see a live leak logo and bad quality your in for a bad day."

" Gripping suspense, poor ending

This helped to build suspense as the character can switch between programmes/apps, muting what was going on elsewhere and having private text chats with others.The only frustration was that half the dialogue was as written messages, meaning it was slow moving in places and you have to be close enough to the screen to read the messages.I liked the message that our actions to others can come back to haunt us and that he internet can be manipulated to expose or embarrass people.Was disappointed with the final scene - much better to leave it suspenseful or as an online only presence to give a sense of more realism and fear of using the web again!"

Somehow I was not surprised by the final, while reading your description, but I was dissapointed (I really wanted to know who the killer was and how the heck he killed all of them in one night)....BUT!!
I really liked the movie. Trust me, this doesn't happen often, but this one was totally different.

But the overall score and the majority of the reviews have it right - this just wasn't that good. I don't care how a movie is made, even if it is done so in a somewhat unique way; what counts is the end result. And long before the end, I got bored. The film is only 83 minutes long, and in under an hour, I was tired of the same thing happening over and over again. And then over again. Right through the end.Originality required more than technique. It requires an engaging story that evolves and keeps one's attention. Here, we just had a single idea beat to death for that 83 minutes.I guess the people involved in this movie are laughing all the way to the bank at the negative reviews, considering the budget and the gross earnings. Fine. Good for them. But regardless, it's just a one-trick script with a one-trick means of execution, all adding up to nothing. The only bright spot is its brevity. So, if you have just over an hour to kill, and are a fan of mediocre to bad horror movies (which most are these days), sure, watch it. Just keep your expectations low."

",0.2144,-0.9636,2019-11-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a massive blunder. I'm completely convinced both the directors and the writer are utterly clueless about what teenagers are really like. The characters weren't written to be believable. They're all revealed , rather than making them sympathetic, which took me out of the moment. The idea of horror is to make you fear for their safety, not make them out to be horrible and worth killing off. There was a scene where Val called the police to report a cyberbully. She. Called. The. Police. She dialed 911. There's nothing they can do and it's not even an emergency. There's a non-emergency line you can call, but that's not an emergency. The physics of this film make absolutely no sense. There are a few sequences where the characters are moving around and the screen clearly shows that they are typing. How does one type that quickly with one hand? I have yet to meet anyone that can type at 60 words a minute standing and walking around. There was another scene where Blair asked what a troll was.....I'm not even kidding. She also demonstrates how absolutely illiterate she is with computers. She frantically clicks on everything in one scene when she could simply listen to what she's being told by Ken. There's more, but I don't even want to think about what utter garbage I just witnessed. Nelson Greaves talked about the concept and said that it sounds idiotic but it works. Nelson, it doesn't just sound idiotic, it IS idiotic.

When your on line experiences are simply message boards and discussion forums etc, where twitter, skype, facebook and their like are alien to them, then one can only praise when an innovative and fresh idea is brought to the horror realm of film making. And lets face it, horror always needs new splinters to off set the ream of numerical sequels and remakes from hell.Unfriended is not scary on conventional terms, where it's not about to jolt you out of your seat or have you hiding behind the sofa. It is, however, scary how technology has advanced, how the millions of world wide web users so willingly commit to baring their innermost to all and sundry. Then there's the dark half, those who use the platforms for venal and nefarious means, bringing very real terrors into our world.I can't personally vouch for how genuine the tech aspects are in this film, but Unfriended definitely taps into a frightening realm, and that is to be applauded.

But I digress.It was actually pretty interesting to me.A lot of people complain about it not being scary or containing the essence of a horror film, and I think that's kind of the point. The cliches of horror are there to throw you off the scent - the real horror comes from these kids and the depths of violence and cruelty that they show themselves to be capable of. They experience horror in the form of a ghost haunting them as they skype and chat online, but any violence that goes on is nothing compared to what they do to each other as they're forced to reveal their own and each other's secrets.That alone, to me, makes it worth watching seriously. And the film has a ""gimmick"" that demonstrates a command of realism that returns to the fundamental idea of the verite style, after so many hackneyed ""found footage"" films made that term meaningless. The same is true for the dialogue - it's not good, because it's realistic. The characters do dumb things because it's realistic. And anyway, the idea of characters doing dumb things is a staple of horror films and makes for good writing. Characters making smart choices does not a good horror film make.I'd recommend it."

Speaking of high schoolers, all of the ""terrible"" things these characters did was just normal teenager stuff and was not shocking in the least bit. The skype glitches made this movie extremely hard to watch and in some spots i found myself cringing at how bad they were. The violent parts of this movie are unsatisfying due to the camera always freezing and panning down. The audio is awful and the pop up messenger was annoying since the audio of the Skype call cuts out. The lack common sense is cringe-worthy and the story never gives a real reason to love or hate any of the characters, you just wanna see violence for the sake of violence and you honestly cant blame yourself since the movie seems to go no wear.

I know some people called it great for younger audiences and also informative about a sensitive issue however i found it neither of these. As a younger audience i was bored and irritated by the lack of logic used in this film, and it really doesnt educate anyone on the topic of cyber bullying.My main issue was the audio, constantly cutting in and out of the conversation was incredibly annoying, especially when you can see that it's happening in the background, instead it's replaced by typing which is a pretty obnoxious sound. There was also the constant changing of apps which made the story unnecessarily complicated. Both of these together ruined the atmosphere of the film and also just made it pretty boring.Some of the kills were pretty cool however the static was overused and became a replacement for good effects or striking visuals and just came off as a little lazy and annoying. Equally, if not more, annoying was the main character who didnt have any particularly good traits and wasn't very likeable. The characters who weren't supposed to be likeable were far more entertaining because there was no pretence, it was bad people being bad people.The narrative didnt reach its full potential and i think it needed more settings or at least different points of view, do some camerawork off of the computer to keep it visually interesting and raise tension.Not the worst but definitely not good enough for a re-watch. Though i must admit that a cyber demon seems like a pretty laughable premise to me so i'm probably not the right audience for this. It just seemed like it was trying too hard to be appealing to a younger audience, giving it an overall feeling of being pretty forced."

This is one of those films where I'd have asked for my money back if I could.The set-up alone wasn't very credible. I mean, what a coincidence that all six people in the chat were people that essentially had something to do with Laura's suicide. When all hell broke loose not one of these idiots thought of shutting down their computers, or unplugging them??? That would have been the sensible thing to do. Instead they kept chatting, and shouting, and scolding, and chatting, and shouting, and scolding...oh, whatever!This might have worked as a 20-minute short, but as a feature film it became tedious and almost unbearable to watch. So there were a few twists towards the end, whoopee-doo! By that time I couldn't care less about any of the characters and wanted the Laura demon, ghost, entity, spirit or whatever the hell she was to get rid of the chatters so the movie could end.

" Surprisingly better than I anticipated.
",0.6249,0.351,2018-11-09 00:00:00,7,"The only reason I watched this, is because my sister and I traded blu rays so we can each see horror films the other has that we haven't. I was very skeptical to watch this.
Blumhouse lately is a hit or miss. Truthfully they find some amazing horror films, then add sequels until they're bled dry.
This film, by the trailer looked, seemed similar to The Gallows which I was forced to go to with my younger brother-in-law and my wife even though I knew it would be terrible; it was by the way.
The movie luckily was not like The Gallows. In fact he biggest thing that surprised me was that the writing and acting was actually good. Usually with low budget horror films they grab some teenagers that have never acted in their life. Drama seems to be the easiest catagory to act but still, the acting was believable.
As for the writing, the premise is simple. However they take a simple idea of Skyping and add elements to the internet that push the story along without just showing the faces of the actors interacting. However, I would probably have more of a hard time watching his again.
Films like Burried and Locke are the same premise as this film in a way and those are both incredible. This film shows more to the watchers eye, however it depends on the performance if you need that. I think with both it adds enough. One thing I hate in teen based horror movies, is lingo. Thank god this film didn't throw a bunch in which also helps age the film.
All in all, it's worth watching at least once. It was entertaining. Blumhouse hit a triple with this film, and thanks to my sister I got to view it."

" Flawed, but unique and painfully relevant
",-0.6808,-0.9969,2018-09-29 00:00:00,8,"Found footage horror as a genre got so tired recently, due to the cost-effectiveness mostly, that it required a drastic renewal. This movie does exactly that. For the entire film, the viewer sees only the screen of the protagonist's laptop, and everything happens through a video conference call via Skype. It sounds strange at first, and I guess it's quite weird when seen on the big screen, but it creates a claustrophobic atmosphere few had accomplished prior to this movie.The story, as I said, is revealed through a group of friends having a group video conference through Skype.
The backstory: a high school girl named Laura Barns beat the Guinness world record of getting wasted at a party, this got recorded, and the video landed on Youtube, with the results being exactly what you would expect. Laura escaped cyberbullying by killing herself, which somehow also got recorded and viral.
On the first anniversary of her death, her six friends meet on Skype for some videochatting, but they get an uninvited and unbannable seventh person in the group call, who wants their darkest secrets exposed and their lives to end.This film, however revolutionary it sounds on paper, suffers from many issues. The negative reviews, I guess, come from the fact that it doesn't work as a horror movie. Some elements work, like the claustrophobic atmosphere I mentioned earlier, or the trick to basically not having any music. I also accept the digital superpowers the mysterious 'Billie' has. It's a ghost story, which is good, as such stories write their own rules every time specifically for the franchise in question. For this plot, the 'hacker ghost' is necessary, and so, it didn't bother me too much. But as a horror movie, Unfriended fails miserably. The kills show zero creativity. We have a blender, a gun, and a knife. The first kill is not even shown. Okay, I must be fair, the hair straightener used as a murder weapon was serviceable, but that's one single kill. This takes a lot away from the overall experience. The realism the movie is stuck to is also a double-bladed weapon, and sometimes we see the wrong end of it. I understand that people would really react like the characters in the movie, but it's insanely distracting that every messed up event is followed by the indistinguishable shouts and screams of the characters. It happens more often than it should, and really hurts the flow of the story.It may sound like I didn't like the film, but despite all this, I loved it. The format is, despite all its problems, is awesome. The acting is acceptable, the script is good, except for a few minor details. The ghost is scary, not by design, but by abilities and skills. The printer trick is one of my all time favorite kill traps. The twist is also good, as it's based on the 'who to root for?' question, and that being an excellent tool for an important message, the film tells you what it wants in a scarily effective manner.Because this is not really a horror film, even if it wants to be. This is a social drama. A very strong one, which warns about responsibility that comes with the use of social media. The scary thing about this movie is not the ghost, but the fact that any of us could suffer the same fate. The story's basic thought is that it takes only two open pages to destroy a human life totally, and the entire internet would assist, because the Internet dosn't have a license to use, like a car, everyone can access it, and those who consider the possible consequences of one single click is unfortunately the minority. The film points this out by not making the friends cruel people. We're talking about totally average and (mostly) realistic teenagers, who don't have the responsibility (maybe just doe to their young age) to the power they unknowingly possess over others. Most of them are even likable for the most part of the story, yet they also took part in a girl's death, as most people would have.This is not a good horror movie. If that's all you want, skip it, you'd hate it.
If you are interested in a great and relevant social criticism and a really tragic drama, disguised as the found footage horror's renewal, you'll love it.
And if you are the type of Facebook and Youtube user who never has a second thought about using the Share button, you MUST see it. Before you cause something you didn't want to."

" Ignore bad reviews and watch it!
",-0.7424,0.8424,2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,The ones writing bad reviews simply didn't focus on the story of the movie. They're expecting more actions over a true great story. I've watched it and it's great!
" Original idea and quite disturbing
",-0.3167,0.4468,2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Not being one for big clichéd blockbuster movies, I appreciated this film for it's originality and attempt at realism. 
Bit late to the review table, as I saw the sequel first (which, on reflection, is a little bit sillier) I watched this because the ""Dark Web"" film had some great ideas which I wanted to see the origin of.
This reminded me of when I first saw Blair Witch Project in that it's a low budget, claustrophobic, real-feeling horror that sucks you into the story and then messes with your mind.
The ""realism"" I liked was the way he film used computer screens - I have never seen any film before accurately reflects the ""normal"" use of computers with any kind of accuracy. They always have some mixture of old-style green screen and modern o/ses with the stupid bloody bleeping noises whenever anything appears on the screen - to actually see something using Facebook with normal computer sounds was quite refreshing!
I can imagine this type of film not appealing to the jump-scare, gore fan - the usual cheesy insult-to-the-intelligence garbage which passes off as horror, but I thought this (and the sequel to a lesser extent) was an interesting departure and almost the start of a new genre. Although, after seeing two films, I can't really imagine where else it would go!"
" Pretty awesome
",0.8074,-0.9443,2018-08-12 00:00:00,8,"I don't get all the hate, really. I thought it was very creative how they used a computer screen to show the story. 
Sure, it didn't have the most surprising story or surprising ending, but it was entertaining. Very entertaining. 
I can't really review the horror aspect of it since I practically never get horrified or scared while watching horror movies, but it definitely had its own charm.
The way the computers are being hacked- it was not even close to how computers are hacked in real life. At least, I guess so based on my own knowledge. I'm not a hacker. So if you can't stand such a flaw and if it would just annoy you the entire time instead of focusing on the movie itself- then it's probably better not to watch it at all. 
Other than that- if you're looking for some entertaining horror flick then go for it. This is a good way to spend your time. Trust me. I've seen enough terrible, bad, awful horror movies and this one is not one of them."
" Glad I took another look 4 years later
",0.4588,0.956,2018-08-05 00:00:00,6,"When I first viewed this film I really didn't like it. Found it to be tedious and slow paced. As the new Unfriended is coming out I thought I'd give this another shot - glad I did. I won't say the acting is fantastic but it doesn't suck either. The scenes are great considering the level of technology at the time of filming. The use of on-line style communication services, seeing how vulnerable the characters were to intrusion and their loss of control of the situation I felt were well directed. I'd recommend it for something to fill up your collection - not great, but worth a watch now and then."
" Great Idea, Poorly Executed
",0.6249,-0.8548,2018-07-27 00:00:00,4,"At first I simply let this movie just, well, pass me by, that is until I discovered that there was going to be a sequel called 'The Dark Web' and the dark web has always intrigued me. More so, when I discovered that my university actually have the video available for digital download I thought I might actually watch it, if only to determine whether I would want to watch the sequel or not. Well, upon discovering what this film was actually about I'm not all that sure if I'm going to bother with the sequel, if this film is anything to go by.
 Honestly, I would probably describe this film as being 'The Blair Witch Project' on the internet. Well, not quite, but when I was released I knew that I probably wasn't going to like it all that much namely because I expected that it was little more than a slasher flick except this time the slasher is some unstable person who was unfriended on Facebook. Actually, I probably shouldn't joke about that because some people have become pretty unhinged due to somebody unfriending them on Facebook, but then again that particular website really does mess with your head at times.
 Anyway, it turned out to be one of those more experimental films, in the the entire film is basically set on somebody's desktop, namely the protagonist Blair. The entire movie is basically a skype conversation between friends, with a few other programs being intermittently used, including a chat program. However, it is more than that because as I mentioned it is also a horror film, so basically there happens to be this unknown person on their chat channel who also seems to be able to post things on their Facebook accounts, send emails, and basically torment them to a point that they basically all want to kill themselves - you could say that it is the ghost in the machine.
 Sure, it is pretty cheesy in that, but the idea was sure to come about sooner or later - making a movie (and they are usually always horror movies) simply with people interacting through their computers. Personally, it isn't a bad idea, except that as one commentator pointed out, if they wanted to watch people screaming their heads off over skype for an hour and a half, then they can just create their own group chats and do it themselves without having to watch this film. I probably agree, but then again I have much better things to do than spend an hour and a half on Skype screaming my head off.
 But there is something going on behind the scenes as well - sort of. The story is based on this girl who killed herself after a video was basically posted to the web. She was at this party, and had become pretty wasted, and her friends, if you would call them that, decided to share this with the world, of course urging her to kill herself as well. Look, sadly that is actually a part of growing up, and it is one of the really nasty things about the creation of the web. Honestly, not a day goes by without some celebrity being struck down because some thoughtless tweet from years ago has emerged. Here, this isn't even her doing it, but rather her friends. In a way it seems that you really have to be careful these days, just in case people get photos of you, and the start sharing them with the world.
 I could say that this film does deal with the issue of cyber bullying, but it also shows us how easy it is for hidden secrets suddenly to be exposed to the world, and how people can literally drive you from the web based on what has been revealed. There has even been stories of people who have had this happen to them and they literally cannot show their face in public again. Sure, there is this idea that people generally use social media to market their good sides, but what we must remember is that we do need to be cautious as to what we place on the web because it can seriously come back to bite us."
" Dull and Annoying
",-0.6597,-0.946,2018-07-25 00:00:00,2,"So, I saw Unfriended: Dark Web the other day and after reading reviews I found out that it was a sequel. Being that Dark Web was so terrible I figured the first one had to be at least decent since they made a sequel. HA!Isn't it the point of a scary movie that you don't want the main character(s) to be killed? Sure, there maybe one or two people who you couldn't care less about but for the most part you're supposed to be rooting for someone right?I could not wait until this merry band of faux friends was wiped out. OMG the yelling and bickering was so unbearable I just wanted them dead to kill the noise. This movie was found footage style like many scary movies before it except the footage was computer cameras from a group Skype chat. Every one of these friends was in some way responsible for cyber-bullying and causing Laura Barns to commit suicide. Now Laura is out to get revenge from the beyond.Between the long spans of watching a text thread and other typing and the yelling back and forth between ""friends"" I was annoyed. The movie cycled between monotonous and irritating with some gnarly deaths sprinkled in here and there. Making a feature length film with mostly a computer screen and talking heads is not a winning formula. This could've been an OK Black Mirror episode at best but not a movie."
" AN AMAZING UNIQUE ADDITION TO THE HORROR GENRE

Some people may expect this film to be a bore but give it a try and you'll see that it's not! It has everything you want in a horror movie from the gory deaths to the shocking twists!

" A lot stupider than people think.
",-0.5423,-0.9633,2018-07-14 00:00:00,1,"I hate this movie. I really hate this movie. It's brainless, utterly stupid and because it made such a large profit we're going to be seeing lots of it from here on in. The premise is decent in that you have a group of friends on a Skype call on the anniversary of one of their friend's suicide and strange things start to happen. The friend, who is definitely dead, joins their chat and even starts sending messages to them in Facebook. Like I said it's a decent enough setup. The problem comes with how they decided to put it all together.All of the action comes from one girl's POV on her computer and we see everybody else on facecam. So we're stuck in one location for the entire movie. What's more this was actually shot with these kids in front of GoPro cameras in the same house but in different rooms which is why you have one person literally doing her part of the chat from the laundry room. Yeah. We're expected to think that these people carry their powered on and connected to the internet laptops around with them everywhere just in case they get an invitation to a Skype call. An invitation I might add that three of them never got and just appeared on the chat between a girl and her boyfriend who were engaged in a little cyber foreplay. They all talk and they bicker like children. It's quite annoying actually. But then maybe it was to make them as unlikable as possible. At least that's my guess. The facecams glitch out to a ridiculous degree but I guess that was done to hide some of the cuts. Although from one shot literally to the next people change position and are away from the webcam when they're still somehow typing. How does that work again? It would have been interesting had they used the glitching a little more effectively. Like maybe, just for a moment, one of the character glitches out and their face is all distorted. Or there's a flash from behind them of a shadow or figure or even just a pair of eyes or something to show that this isn't a normal Skype call. Don't call attention to it, just have it there to give us a sense of unease. The way that these kids are then killed is then telegraphed very early on. If you see them with something in their hand, or close by, that will be how they die. So it makes sense that the fat kid has a blender there at his desk so later on when he gets possessed he uses that to blend his hand followed by his neck. Or the girl using the curling iron in the first scene winds up dying when it's thrust down her throat.And in the end the last one to survive is actually the one that is responsible for the death of their friend. What a shocker and follow it up with a jump scare. The end.This is a stupid movie."
" Wasnt expecting much, was still disappointed
",-0.4767,-0.8788,2018-07-10 00:00:00,2,"I bought this movie for a ""bad horror movie"" night. I would say that this wasnt even worth the 4 dollars I ended up spending on it. The characters are very unlikable. My partner and I spent the entire movie rooting for the ghost. It felt the movie tried to make the characters seem like nice, average people with dark secrets. They didnt succeed. The characters were douchebags who became more and more unsympathetic as the movie continued. Worst of all, the scares werent scary or even funny. They were really milquetoast, tbh. Even the final attempt at a ""scare"" was just boring. I wouldnt even reccommend this to an enemy, its just so bland and boring.Like, the idea was cute and all, but the execution was awful."
" Original, entertaining, but silly - 68% (Favorable)
",0.4118,0.9748,2018-07-02 00:00:00,7,"I feel about this movie much like how I felt about The Purge (also made by Blumhouse). It has a neat premise, it's intense and engrossing, has a pretty good lead performance, and says some interesting things about society. The movie also deserves some credit for possibly redefining ""found-footage"" and ""low-budget"" since this movie was filmed almost entirely on a computer screen. However, I can't say Unfriended is particularly good; this horror movie did not scare me at all and had many stupid and over the top moments, with an entity that felt like more like an internet troll that a vengeful spirit. All that being said, it's still enjoyable and way better than it should have been."

Oh yea, another cliche for this film, ""Amazon won't let me give zero stars"" seems to apply.Now I will admit, I don't video chat because I can only type naked. Perhaps young adults who spend their time video chatting with a circle of friends might love this film. I couldn't relate to it on any level.

Now, commenting if that is how they ""should"" behave is a totally different subject.Second, for its interesting format, the movie's premise found the perfect demographic to display its plot, a group of misfits each different than the other, each with something to hide. The characters were designed in such way to not root for any of them, which I felt almost from the beginning and the ending gives us a great moral and that is ""to be a better friend"".I have to admit, going in the first 10 minutes, I did tend to turn it off, because it didn't really feel like a theatrical release, but more like someone used a software to record a Skype session. Plus, for someone who would know how to use a computer well, you would find some inconsistencies but nothing major to disrupt the plot or to make it unwatchable.Before finding out it was supernatural, I really wished it was some sort of a real revenge and not a paranormal haunting, but nevertheless it ultimately delivered into a average to decent horror film."

All the characters are unlikable and do nothing except curse out, insult, and otherwise act like horrible people to one another, so you feel nothing when they're all eventually killed off. The premise is interesting on paper but is executed super poorly, either with long plodding silent scenes of watching people read things off their screens or garbled ""webcam"" footage as people die. The death scenes are also hard to follow, with one apparently dying from a seizure, I had to rewatch the scene numerous times but couldn't never tell what was happening. I can't recommend this film, in fact I suggest if you see it, destroy it, take the disc and crack it in half, you'll have a better time watching the disc break than you would watching the movie it contain."

The acting was average, they were convincing as basic teenagers, but the biggest issue with this movie was the characters. Ignore the terribly cringe-inducing story line, the characters were so unlikable. I've never seen a movie that made me hate the main characters more. Part of what makes a good thriller is actually fearing the fate of the characters you love. The blonde girl, Jess, was so unlikable that part of me actually felt relieved when she died. It was the same with all of the characters, they were portrayed as basic rich white kids with no issues and a cliquey attitude. Every one of these characters made a girl kill herself, so why should I feel bad when they die too? They were all pretty annoying teens and it made the movie unbearable. I will give it some credit for the style of the movie, I like those screen-share movies/episodes of shows. (also what was with the computer taking forever to download a 999KB file, yet hardly lagging at all in a multi person Skype call? and playing songs without buffering? and loading pages instantly? when my computer is downloading stuff at 55kb/s it takes FOREVER to load everything else.)"

" Can't Even Call This a Movie
",0.0,-0.9906,2017-10-10 00:00:00,1,"Seriously, a horror movie centered around Skype? Give me a break. This is was another movie that I was drawn into by previews and I have to say that I regret it. I thought it was actually be somewhat enjoyable...but it was anything but. Sitting in front of the computer and chatting with your friends is not what I want to watch for 83 minutes. Do that on your own time. The camera that was probably used for this so-called film was most likely a webcam. Why? Nobody moves. Not a soul.Centered around a group of young people who are haunted by the suicide of another friend of theirs, they just talk and talk and talk about nothing. Even for 83 minutes, it still goes by painfully slow. This must have been very cheap to make because the death scenes are absolutely ridiculous and nobody moved from their respective spots. Um, isn't the idea of a movie to go from set to set and not sit in one place for the whole thing?I don't see how something like this could have even made a profit. As with so many others like it, there are no scares and you can almost see the deaths before they come because the unseen spirit of the dead friend is tormenting them into killing themselves. Just plain pathetic, if you ask me. I always love a good ghost story, but this was just out-and-out dreadful. No way around it. No special effects, pathetic dialogue, and it all takes place in front of a single computer. The actors who put this piece of film muck should be ashamed of themselves. Aren't there other worthy horror scripts that young people like this could pick up and audition for? Apparently not. I have never been a firm believer in Instant Messaging or Skype, particularly because I have next to no one to talk to on it. Um, there's something called a cell phone that you can talk to your friends on. You don't need Skype to have a conference call about next to nothing."
" Cybernatural Indeed
",0.0,0.1154,2017-10-07 00:00:00,7,"On the anniversary of their friend's suicide, a group of teenagers themselves stalked online by a presence claiming to be their dead friend in this supernatural thriller, also known rather appropriately as 'Cybernatural'. The most notable aspect of the film is its format; the entire movie is simply one static computer screen and yet, as its user flips between various windows, Skype conversations and social media accounts, the filmmakers manage to drum up a surprising amount of suspense. In a way, the film is spookier due to the fact that it never leaves the computer monitors, which prevents us from seeing their surroundings in which evil spirits may lurk. The characters also feel like they are in increased danger due to the format. Much like 'Phone Booth' - or the eerie short film 'La Cabina' - the characters here are never in control given the threats posed by the mysterious entity should they choose to move away. As far as the basic plot of 'Unfriended' goes, it is fairly routine restless spirit, possession and retribution stuff, but as mentioned, the static screen format provides quite an edge. This is, by the way, arguably a film best viewed on one's home laptop or mobile device; glorious as the film may look on Blu-ray on a flat screen television, this is a movie for all those times we have felt that there is something wrong with our computer."

",-0.5423,0.679,2017-08-19 00:00:00,5,"Horror movie that plays with the new fashion of ""online curses"".A group of friends in a Skype chatroom are haunted by a mysterious and supernatural entity that uses the account of a deceased friend to torment them.The concept is original, I'll give it that, with all the film done through the perspective of the laptop of one of their users, that is, everything unfolds as if we were focused on the computer screen of one of the characters, running applications on a Mac from iTunes to Facebook and even the already forgotten ChatRoulette.What I disliked in a certain way - although, well, is a reflection of this modern society - was the fact that the group was watching their friends die and instead of getting up to call the police or go directly to the police station or go to their friends house, no: they just keep playing perverse games with the mysterious entity so that it does not reveal the dirty secrets of each one of them... online!!! Some friends they are... Maybe that's the message (if any): people are more concerned about their online life than with reality, even if it means death for themselves or others."
" Worst Horror Movie I've Ever Seen
",-0.8316,-0.9979,2017-08-19 00:00:00,2,"!WARNING SPOILERS! Unfriended is considered a ""Thriller"". There are multiple fake jump scares like Blaire's alarm to make her sleep, which is just a loud noise, nothing scary actually happened. At the start they force all the items that kill the teenagers into shot, like making salsa at your computer desk (blender). It is very boring to watch when Blaire clicks off Skype and decides to text with Mitch, we also have to just wait for Mitch's response which just puts more seconds on to the film. There are a lot of parts in this movie where they just try to add more seconds on to the film. This movie was supposed to be a realistic film but the idea of a ghost hacking into her own account, ruining other people lives, then torturing and killing the teens was just stupid. There are also the scenes where the characters just teleport across the screen which the directors probably though that the people just won't notice. People were saying that this was a new revolutionary idea where it's just you watching a screen, you could do the same with a couple of your friends at home on Skype and film the screen with Quick Time Player! It is annoying how stupid the main character is at using the computer. The ending of the movie would had been a little bit better if it ended on her life being ruined which I thought it would finish on but NO this movie decided it would be better if we put a bad jump scare in at the end of the movie of the ghost popping up! When the teens are killed there are done terribly, The only one that looks realistic was the hair straighteners down the throat, but the rest have really bad CGI blood. Finally the most annoying part of this movie was the stupid glitches whenever the actor mess up so they can add a new cut. If you would like a laugh at how bad this movie is then please go watch it because it's on Netflix, but if you would like to see a good horror movie do not waste 1h22mins of your life by watching Unfriended.Unfriended is the worst horror movie I have ever seen: 2/10"
" Very Simple & Boring
",-0.3774,-0.7977,2017-08-18 00:00:00,2,"This movie was terrible. I had to be forced to finish watching it. It ended OK, but it was very hard to get there. Just teens on the Internet, clicking from site to site. Then dying off for all to see. I'm not big on supernatural anyways, but when you add in an awful script, it is completely not watchable,"
" I gave it a generous 7
",0.5106,-0.7935,2017-08-07 00:00:00,7,"It was kind of an interesting concept. I only use Facebook, so I was a bit limited in understanding the camera visuals and technology behind it. The typed messages went by rather fast, and I couldn't see all the messages unless I watched the film close to my TV screen. Apparently they're going to make a sequel, or already did? The characters were a mess. Hysterics constantly, and not having parents at home kind of ruined the film. It has to be somewhat believable to be good.Not really a bad concept, so for those of you that loved it, I can understand why."
" An underrated gem
",0.0,-0.8949,2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"I went into the theater for Unfriended years ago thinking not too highly of it. The trailer I had seen was pretty bad and I made a last minute decision to go see it. But I really enjoyed the movie and as soon as the credits started rolling, I wanted to see it again. Lucky for me, the movie was going to be releasing a couple months later and I bought a copy. What I thought was sad about the movie was the fact that people hated on it solely because the trailer was absolutely garbage. I think a majority of horror movie junkies can agree that today's horror trailers are very very very bad. I don't blame the movie, I blame the producers. What really made the film was the cast of teens that played off of each other's paranoia really well. The entirety of the movie felt like it was going to be overwhelming, but it stayed above the line and never got into bad territory.I'm shocked and surprised by the lack of attention this movie got because of the trailer. Most people dismissed the movie because they thought it was Universal's cheap version of Insidious, which is not a fair assessment to make. Regardless of how it ended, I stand by that this movie is criminally underrated."
" Whiny Digital Addicts Getting Offed
",0.0,-0.9988,2017-06-07 00:00:00,1,"At the risk of sounding like a hipster, I'm going to state that though digital tech has its uses (IMDb for example), the digital age is disgusting and has spawned an attitude of selfishness, being jerky at the expense of others, and never bothering to learn about anything that doesn't have a glowing screen or that doesn't offer instant gratification. I hate cell phones and have never owned one, they're more annoying and invasive than anything else, and so I was reluctant to go and see a film that is completely set online. Surprisingly though, it was not so much the digital tech featured that bothered me (though it was a very painful viewing experience), but actually what got me most annoyed with 'Unfriended' was the cr*p mentality of just about every character, including Laura herself.Okay, suicide is by no means funny, nor should it be taken lightly or mocked, but I just can't buy the notion that this Laura girl felt the need to commit suicide over getting drunk and pooping herself at some stupid party. Sure, it sounds embarrassing as hell, but give me a break. It was not only unnecessarily gross and crass to have this in the film, but I think it was a huge mistake on the part of the director to include that in the story. It sounds ridiculous and it makes it extremely difficult to take the character's pain seriously or to actually care about her. And of course, she didn't just stop at shooting herself in the head before her entire school, oh no, not her, after that her freakin' ghost has to come back and knock off the people who gave her grief in life. Just picture Carrie White, only except for having genuinely understandable reasons for hating the world, Laura gets all hung up over one stupid little embarrassing incident in a petty and pathetic way.To be fair to ""Leaky Laura"" as her classmates so lovingly call her, it's understandable why she didn't like her friends. These are the most shallow characters I've ever seen in a film, and most of 'Unfriended' is just a big show of their childish and moronic behaviour. For example, a boy pressuring his girlfriend into taking her clothes off. The girlfriend just laughingly going along with it in a Skype-style scene which drags on for ages. We've got one guy whose big concern after two of his friends are killed right in front of him is that he might be arrested by the cops for possessing not LSD, not meth, not coke, but... brace yourself... weed. Oh, the horror. The constant profanity and also the very brief ""dick pic"" shot that comes up on-screen doesn't help the story go by any better, either.As I mentioned above, this film is painful to watch also because of its cinematography, if you should even call it that. The ENTIRE THING takes place on a computer screen, and so the viewer is subjected to over an hour of angst-ridden Facebook posts, purposely fragmented video clips on YouTube (apparently they thought breaking up the only pre-recorded content in the whole film would look more ""digital""), close-up Skype shots of these zit-faced kids talking - the whole thing just looks cheap and ugly and lazy, and yet somehow 'Unfriended' used up over a million dollars to be created. You could finance an entire soup kitchen for over a year with that money, or maybe actually a film that tries to be seriously impressive, not this load of garbage that rides on being ""modern"" to justify a dumb plot and cheap techniques. As for it being ""scary"", it's not, unless you're one of those shrill-screaming twelve-year-olds who gets freaked out by a couple of jump scares. The soundtrack was awful, many of the shots were either too blurry or too crowded, and was it really necessary to have the WHOLE thing set online? I mean Jesus Christ, I would have been thrilled at twenty minutes in to even just have the computers closed while they heat up a pizza pocket in the microwave for crying out loud. It was THAT BAD.Maybe I'm being too hard on this film, but I just didn't like it. It was a huge waste of time, and I really don't get it, because lately there have been many decent modern horror films being released. 'Sinister', 'The Poughkeepsie Tapes', 'Exhhibit A', 'Lake Mungo', 'The Woman in Black' - so what on earth possessed anybody to think that 'Unfriended' was a good idea? Even a pet rock would be better entertainment."
" not the best but still good
",0.3952,0.9357,2017-06-06 00:00:00,8,"i don't want the get in to the story but the story was 6.5/10i found the small desktop space annoying but otherwise its a good movie. for me it wasn't too scary but it was worth watching, but my kids (13 and 15) they were scared and they absolutely loved it.i saw allot of people saying its not scary, boring and unoriginal. and i went into the film with low expectations but i was wrong it was amazing, original, and most of the people who didn't like the movie sounded like edgy wannabe kids. :/ (my first rewiew) :D"
" Typical horror movie aimed at teens
",-0.5719,-0.9377,2017-05-18 00:00:00,2,"'Unfriended' is about how the ghost of a girl who committed suicide comes back to haunt the people who were part of the reason she killed herself, via Skype. Yeah, it's as bad as it sounds.Firstly, the acting was terrible. I found the whole thing incredibly awkward and forced, most of it being a lot of yelling at the other cast members. The characters were likewise terrible, the only form of character development we get is them admitting to some of the awful stuff they did to Laura and each other. Blaire says they're 'good people' at one point, girl are you kidding me? I don't see why they couldn't have just decided to wait till another day to Skype each other anyway, it was nothing urgent and if you see a glitch wouldn't you just leave the app so it could sort itself out? That's one thing teenagers in horror movies can never seem to do; think of logical solutions.The reason I watched it was because I liked the concept of it all being shown on the laptop screen as an interface. I saw something similar when I was watching an old episode of Modern Family the other day, where a whole episode was based off the screen of Claire's laptop. However, whilst Modern Family is a comedy and managed to keep the idea concise and interesting, the worst point about Unfriended is that because of the interface idea, there is a lot of time where nothing happens. Half of the movie is spent watching Blaire typing, scrolling through Facebook or dodgy websites, or the characters looking confused whilst someone's screen lags. It was incredibly slow paced because of this and when it boils down to it, there's actually a rather short amount of time devoted to actual action/interaction between the characters. Instead you're just sat there watching a screen lag and wondering why you didn't just call your own friends on Skype as it would it have been more entertaining.In short, a good idea perhaps, but very poor execution, not worth anyone's time to be honest."
" Gimmicky as hell
",-0.6808,-0.9931,2017-05-17 00:00:00,3,"The horror genre, in my opinion, is losing its touch. There's only so many ways you can shock people. I was proved correct when I stumbled upon this film. How on earth can you keep people on the edge of their seats when literally all you are seeing is a perspective shot of a computer screen?The main story is that a Skype conversation is going underway between a group of friends in the wake of the news that a friend of theirs has committed suicide over cyberbullying and slut-shaming. They are hacked by a user account claiming to be the ghost of the dead girl and from there, it's kinda predictable.The one main issue is that all the characters are unlikable as hell. Typical conceited, complacent high school kids (or at least I think they are despite the fact that they all look like they're in their early 20s but one of them brings up the 'prom' at one point, and it's never addressed again) Why would you want to listen to a Skype conversation, complete with fluctuating video and audio quality, and overlapping voices throughout.Eventually, the 'ghost' of the dead girl starts torturing the group by circulating embarrassing and controversial photos and information on social media, ultimately tearing them apart. Things go off the rails when the group start dying, one by one, in the most ridiculous ways.After watching 13 Reasons Why, I can't help but compare this crumbling mess to it. While 13 Reasons Why deals with the same issue of suicide and the people who have wronged the deceased, this film has similar themes but it is just so convoluted. I had no sympathy for any of the characters and it just got out of hand for no reason."
" Nope.
",0.0,-0.843,2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,"Spoilers- Duh. So I remember first watching Unfriended, and it was worse than CANCER. The acting was terrible, it was unrealistic, and worse of all it wasn't scary and it was BORING beyond all measures. Maybe not as bad as The Visit, but surely bad enough to be a 1/10. It made no sense. Didn't prove a point. Didn't do anything except make me want to leave the theater and kill myself."
" A silent movie of sorts
",0.0,0.9382,2017-04-18 00:00:00,7,"Unfriended is largely a silent movie. Lots of silence that is punctuated with the sounds of typing and the swooshing of messages. Music rarely breaks through. That may put off some but I thought it added to the tension. I was also a huge fan of the slow pacing. There's a scene where a file is downloaded. And you sit and watch it download for about 20 seconds. It could've been downloaded in a second or opened instantly. However making me sit and wait for the file to download made me feel right in the middle of the scene. Sadly the horror side of things sweeps away any deeper dialogue. It would've been great to hear the characters speak about their feelings and regrets, what they would've done differently if they had their time again etc. Instead the gore kicks in. I understand that it's a horror flick but I wish there was more character speak. Finally whoever did the tech is brilliant. Skype, Spotify, Facebook etc are all rendered perfectly. Again this put me right in the picture. Add all the spelling mistakes in the texting and messaging and the feel of the film was superb. Well worth watching."
" Interesting in Theory, Horrible in Practice.
",-0.2023,0.5519,2017-04-10 00:00:00,2,"While the idea of a horror film centered around a group of friends on Skype filmed in one take multiple times seems fairly original and interesting, the execution was absolutely terrible. I spent most of the movie wondering how typing on a laptop while nothing else is going on can pass as a movie.Firstly, our characters were unlikable and ultimately too stupid to feel empathetic for at all. (especially the main character) Many times I sat there saying, ""Is this really what the film industry sees young adults as?"" There was a point in the film where Blaire tries to clean any possible viruses off of her PC in an attempt to get rid of the stranger in the Skype call and not only did she empty the trash bin before the software was done scanning her PC but she didn't even know which program it was that was keeping her from cleaning her PC even though you can see it running in the background. The ""tension"" in this film would never have even been there if the person who should have at least a basic understanding of computers had a basic understanding of computers. Ironically it was the antagonist ghost that seemed to be the most enjoyable character. It probably doesn't help either that the acting was, at best, pretty poor.Secondly, the plot was nice enough to give us some cool foreshadowing towards the beginning of the film. Then of course it gave us some more. Then it gave us even more. Then in gave us even more. The best part of all of the foreshadowing is that none of it is subtle. So about ten minutes into the film I just sat there thinking, ""They are all going to die and it will probably be because of the ghost of the girl they drove to commit suicide."" The plot was as predictable as a horse race in which all the horses only had two legs except for number three who had thirty legs working centipede style.All in all this film was funny during some of its more idiotic moments but really it was a huge waste of time. Boring and predictable plot, unlikable characters, crappy editing (nice job distorting the character's voice but not the background noises), and bad acting are just a few issues this film suffers from. Considering this was done in a way in which you can just take bits and pieces from each run through this should've been one of the best films of the year but it wasn't. The worst part? There's going to be a sequel."
" Unfriended
",0.0,-0.9569,2017-03-06 00:00:00,6,"'Unfriended' is a modern horror film with interesting messages about modern society and our addiction to social networking tools on the Internet. It touches on quite a sensitive subject in cyber bullying from the very disturbing introduction. It tells the story of a teenage girl who was publicly humiliated on the internet and commits suicide due to the heckling and bullying from her peers. A year on and it seems that this group of peers are being stalked online by a vengeful pursuer.Gabradze's direction is very intriguing. 'Unfriended' (lovingly renamed 'Mad Macs' by me) plays out in very simplistic fashion. The film shows the main character's computer screen throughout it's duration. The audience see every keystroke and mistake made by Blaire Lily (Shelley Hennig). This is a very compelling technique when trying to show the character's panic and fear slowly progressing. Blaire plays around with music software known as 'Spotify' during the film which gives an excuse for there to be non- diegetic music to add to the atmosphere.As the film is mainly a conference video call on 'Skype', the actors are in separate rooms on individual ""webcams"" to add to the realism of the story. Although the film didn't require the actors each to connect to the internet, occasional screen buffering and flickering help add to the illusion.'Unfriended' is a very dialogue-driven film as not a lot of action takes place. Therefore, it is essential to have a good screenplay to keep the story as intriguing as possible. The screenplay is solid and there are genuine moments when the mysterious stalker is very creepy and scary. Due to the nature of the film's themes, there is a lot of slang and computer terms that seasoned users of said social networking tools will appreciate and understand. If you are not very wise to how these programs work it may be hard to keep up with the story.The actors weren't the best but the film did work. It would seem that their jarring and annoying demeanor added to the theme of the piece however.Overall, 'Unfriended' is an interesting film. I thought it was a very clever statement on modern life. There were moments that were genuinely scary and creepy but like most modern horror films it relied too much on jump scares. It conjured up good memories of 'The Blair Witch Project' in how it tried to be as realistic as possible whilst also addressing dark themes of today's culture. My final rating for this film is 3 stars. You'll either love it or hate it."
" Innovative, deep, meaningful... NOT!
",0.4926,0.9086,2017-02-08 00:00:00,5,"I truly can't understand the enthusiasm surrounding this movie. The innovative character everyone seems to be so thrilled about is merely and exclusively formal. The substance is as boring and obvious as it could possibly be. The cute couple's issues, the best friendships going to pieces, the unnecessarily trivial secrets... The FF horror form wasn't born for this. Found Footage means shocking the public with sensational plot twists (The Visit), boosting curiosity (The Conspiracy) and narrating impossible, even otherworldly experiences ( As Above so Below; Grave Encounters) : exploiting the noble FF expedient for stupid teenagers' quarrels over some Facebook shaming video just seems inappropriate."
" This was absolutely Awful!!!! A waste of time
",-0.6424,-0.9546,2017-01-25 00:00:00,1,"The 6 primary characters are raucous, angry, and rude. They reminded me of the sparrows that bicker and squabble at my bird feeders. A thoroughly unlikable bunch so you couldn't really identify with them or even empathize with them as they suffered through the difficulties set before them. The actors and actresses are comely enough, at least until they open their mouths and speak, and perhaps they would do better in another venue but they certainly didn't add value to this story. The plot was thin and their was little explanation of how ""the entity"" accomplished it's task so there was no sense that this could happen in my house. Which, in turn, made this the least scary horror film I have watched in a long time - I think it is on par with Abbot and Costello meet the mummy but at least Abbot and Costello were funny.As the movie unfolds you discover the terrible things each one of them has done and instead of making them more human, as minor character flaws often do, it makes you go from trying hard to understand and appreciate them to really disliking them.The graphics and sound problems (pix-elating, ghosting, dropped and/or muted voice) didn't make the Skype conversation seem more real and just served as another annoyance on par with the terrible dialog.Towards the end I was actively rooting for ""the entity"" both because it would mean the movie was over and because each and every character deserved more than they got.Not worth watching!!!!"
