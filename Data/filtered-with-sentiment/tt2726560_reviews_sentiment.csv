" Two excellent romance story in one!!
",0.8353,0.8689,2021-03-18 00:00:00,10,One of my favorite romance movies now and I enjoy it
" Cheesy, Predictable, Bland,...but cute.
",0.4588,0.9854,2021-03-10 00:00:00,7,"Tried to imitate the Notebook, didn't really work.
Boring Characters with no real depth.
Storytelling is unrealistic, cheesy, and completely predictable. It really is, just another romance movie that we've seen a million times, movie attempts to bring provoke emotion, but it just doesn't stick.
But with all things said, there are cute scenes, and good quotes here and there. The story of Ira and Ruth, was notably and significantly better than Luke and Sophia.This is just another Romance movie, we've all seen a million times before, nothing fresh brought to the table. One of the films you would find in the 5 dollar movie bin at Walmart. You shouldn't go out of your way let alone spend money watch it.In conclusion: Just another typical Romance film, don't expect anything memorable, outstanding or praiseworthy. But it isn't unwatchable."
" Falsely advertised as a bull rider's story.
",0.0,0.943,2021-02-23 00:00:00,2,"My husband is a fan of bull rider's like JB Mauney and regularly watches DB on his YouTube channel, Dale Brisby. I thought this could be something that we could both enjoy. However, this is a story about a German Jew who escapes Germany around 1940 and meets her Jewish man in America. The love story copies the idea from Nicholas Spark's romance novel, ""Every Breath"". Unfortunately we couldn't watch this past the half way mark. It was a slow start to a story I didn't even want to watch."
" 2 stories 2 reviews
",0.0,-0.0258,2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"One story was wholesome, believable and had depth. The other bland and cringy the whole time. Luke and Sophia had no spark or chemistry and should have honestly been played other actors; this genre of movie is just not for them. The acting between the two couples is night and day and I hated when it transitioned back to the modern story.
The reason for 7 stars and not 5 is because of the older story."
" one love story inspires another.
",0.7964,0.6808,2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,"PBR rider Luke (Scott Eastwood) goes on a date with cutie Sophia (Britt Robertson), and on the way home, they pass a burning car. Mr. Hero Luke pulls the guy out to safety, and Sophia rescues a box of letters in the car. in the hospital, Sophia reads the letters, and FLASHBACK... we learn how Ira (Alan Alda) met and married his wife. Luke and Sophia have THEIR own ups and downs. there's a jam packed ending.. can't say too much, but if you've sat through this LONG film (over two hours), don't bail before the ending. a lot going on there. which was kind of out of place from the rest of the film. but it works if you buy into it. directed by George Tillman. story by Nick Sparks. many of his tales have tragedy, or life changing events. much like his own story. but we carry on. it's good. but long. showing on various streaming movie channels through roku."

" THE BEST OF NICHOLAS SPARKS FILM !!!
",0.7788,0.9985,2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"The Longest Ride is a 2015 American Neo Western romantic drama film, Based on Nicholas sparks' 2013 novel of the same name starring Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson as the leading stars. As conflicting paths test their bond, a couple find inspiration in their romance. The movie is on for 2 hours but what lovely story telling from beginning to end its very touching emotional and light hearted to watch. The acting was beautiful from all the cast and the chemistry between Scott and Britt was sensational so believable. So well directed and written love story that really hits you in the heart and gets you very emotional. The movie has some amazing views of North Carolina. I just fell in love with this film can't believe I have left it this long to watch it just absolutely sensational. This is no doubt the best movie by Nicholas Sparks. So if you like Dear John and Safe Haven then you will just fall in love with this film it's the best one yet. So as there is nothing much to do through lockdown get comfortable in front of fire with hot beverage and enjoy this amazing beautiful journey of true love. Was streaming on Netflix don't know how long for."

" I kind of rooted for the bull until the end
",0.0,0.9677,2020-11-28 00:00:00,7,"So: two beautiful leads, Alan Alda, scenery, very little art but still, a bit of schmalz here and there... It was better than expected. Even before reading the reviews, I was expecting a traditional romcom, then i read that it was an adaptation of a Nicholas Spark's novel and that did not put me off because, I mean, shirtless Scott Eastwood!
I first got interested in this movie because I thought the actress was Jennifer Lawrence. Both Robertson and Reeves/Eastwood give a performance that is better than the script actually needs but it is a real blessing (just as it happens in ""The Notebook"") to also have Alan Alda, Oona Chaplin and Jack Houston to break the monotony.
I found extremely interesting the side story about the world of the bull riding circuit. It feels pretty much as disturbing as watching a corrida in Spain but I can understand why it is still a thing in the US, just as much as I get why they keep hunting foxes in UK and the whole Corrida tradition in Spain. Though. To be completely fair, in all these events, I believe it should be a possibility to organise a merciful killing of the injured animal (be it a fox, bull, hunter, torero or rider), but maybe I am not the best audience for this kind of films. The two times I was really moved during the movie where when I was shown the poor bulls and when there was talking of big money connected to art collecting. Ultimately though, I enjoyed the movie so I thank everybody involved for creating it."
" life changing
",0.0,0.9946,2020-08-30 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this movie. The plot is a bit cliche but what else can you expect from a Nicholas Sparks movie. I loved both stories so much and I loved the ways they connected. This movie made me cry not only because of sadness but also because of happiness, which is always the goal. Moral of the story my goal in life is now to have a love like not only like Ira and Ruth but also a love like Luke and Sophia. A love that makes my life a portrait of happiness. Thank you."
" Loved this wonderful movie!
",0.8356,0.9879,2020-08-16 00:00:00,10,"My wife and I see a lot of romantic movies (daily). This one tops all we have seen in recent years. The two stories really enhanced the romance, the suspense, and kept us engaged 100%. Alan Alda did a great job in his role, and the young actress who played his wife did a fantastic job in her role. The two main characters also did an excellent job and had plenty of chemistry. I hope we can find more productions like this one. And the surprise ending was really worth watching!"
" My second favorite Sparks adaptation after The Notebook
",0.4588,0.9892,2020-07-28 00:00:00,8,"Rich characters and setting and an emotional, touching story of two generations in love make this a favorite of mine that parallels The Notebook, though that earlier film remains my favorite. This is a charming, well acted story that varies in structure from the book but in a good way, Alan Alda is at his best here and Britt Robertson and Scott Eastwood are a great couple. Thoroughly enjoyable and moving film with a fun twist at the end that is all Sparks."
" Inspire Sacrifice
",0.5719,0.9186,2020-07-03 00:00:00,8,A great movie that Inspire Sacrifice for the sake of love
" A completely perfect romance drama
",0.8347,0.9976,2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,"I watched this for the first time today & I just instantly fell in love. It's such a perfect film that I didn't want to end. The casting choices were absolutely perfect. I believed every word that Alan Alda spoke in this film, reading the letters & telling stories of a real long love. An old school love, so beautifully done, inspiring a new love. Young Ruth & Young Ira shared amazing chemistry. They went through a lot but managed to stay with each other & share one amazing love story. Oona Chaplin is a star. Scott Eastwood & Britt Robertson play Luke & Sophia & are very believable in their careers. They share the struggles of a new relationship & how to balance the possibility of forever vs a career. Ira's last gift to them was truly remarkable & made me get really emotional. I thought this movie hit all the right spots with neither the romance or the drama dragging on too long. Tasteful sex scenes, heartbreaking moments & real life decisions that can change the outcome. Making sacrifices for the ones you love is a huge part of having successful relationships. Perfect casting, perfect writing & an amazing story. I highly recommended this film."
" two love stories in central north carolina
",0.6369,0.9662,2020-06-03 00:00:00,9,It was difficult at first to believe a professional bull rider from a small central north carolina but i guess anything is possible ... the parallel romances were well done ... i particularly liked the vacation that ira and ruth took to the north carolina seashore ... also the parallel between the longest rides by luke and ira ... the fairy tale ending was especially nice ... i really liked the story and have watched it numerous times ... thank you

" ""Love requires sacrifice... Always.""
",0.6369,0.9959,2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Man oh man! Where do I start with? This movie is highly grounded in emotions. It outpasses the true meaning of love and its different facets that comes alongwith.The central plot basically revolves around two people with different ambitions in life who despite the fragility of their bonding yet fall in love, unintendedly. Isn't that how love is supposed to be pure? The sub-plot involves an old man who develops an unusual bond with the girl and tells her his love story from past through the letters he had written to his loved one, resonating closely to the young couple. What is the lesson learnt and will the souring relationship mends or not forms rest of the story.Scott Eastwood has given his career best performance but the real treasure was to watch Britt Robertson who brings freshness to the old-school filmography. Oona Chaplin showcased a desirable yet vulnerable character. Rest of the cast has done a pretty good job in their respective roles. Screenplay of the movie is quite intelligently written and it never loses its track till the end. BGM is OK (songs were good, though) and direction explores the culture of Western countryside captively.Watch it if you like movies based on the idea of innate desire and sacrifice predominated by love (expected from Nicholas Sparks).My rating: 7.8/10"

" Scott Eastwood *hearteyesemoji*
",0.0,0.9951,2020-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Before I watched this movie I read the book by Nicholas Sparks. I have to say that I was a little disappointed due to the fact that there were many differences between the book and movie. However, I very much did enjoy the way the film portrayed two different love stories in one movie and connected them perfectly. sometimes this can be a challenge with too much going on with the different couples and also trying to keep the audience intrigued. Both relationships fit so perfectly together in the storyline even though they went through different situations in life. What I love most about the movie is that it is relatable for many relationships with having to sacrifice and continue to make an effort when they are faced with struggles. Also this movie had a great cast who brought so much emotion to the film. I feel that I could connect with the characters and feel their emotions. I laughed, cried, and smiled. I absolutely love this movie!edit: 2020The Longest Ride starring Scott Eastwood was not my first movie with him in it. There couldn't have been anyone better than Scott Eastwood to play the role of Luke Collins. The story itself was already a complicated one enough all on its own. I was really satisfied and impressed how directer George Tillman, Jr developed it beautifully enough to run so smoothly. His strategy had me hooked since the first scene till' the very last one. I was satisfied with every single character in this movie as well. Im not really able to point out any negative flaws within the movie. I highly do recommend this movie to anyone looking to get on a roller coaster of emotions. Something Nicholas Sparks has a habit of doing in almost all of his novels. This movie had a bit of everything with is what i think made it such a great movie. Especially for those who steer towards these types of moves. Whether as those that tend to stay on a single set throughout the entire movie."

" The best movie of all time
",0.6369,0.9988,2019-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Longest Ride: A love story that takes you on the ride of a lifetime
Longest Ride is directed by George Tillman Jr. and based off of the book by Nicholas Sparks, The Longest Ride is the classic love story with a twist. The movie stars Luke Collins, a professional bull rider looking to be the best of the best, who is portrayed by the handsome Scott Eastwood along with college student, art lover and sorority sister, Sophia played by Britt Robertson. The movie begins when Sophia's sorority drag her to the rodeo Luke is participating in and the two meet and begin to fall in love, but with Sophia getting ready to head to New York City for her dream job and Luke trying to make a comeback in the bull riding scene, their relationship might not make it. As the two try and figure it all out, they meet an elderly man named Ira. We first meet Ira when he crashed his car into a tree and Luke comes to the rescue and takes him to the hospital. Throughout the movie Ira tells them stories about him and his beloved wife and how they got through life and their struggles together, which gives Sophia and Luke lessons about life and love.
Ira, a world war 2 veteran, played by Alan Alda is very grouchy the first time we talk to him, slowly the audience falls in love with him and his stories as he grows closer with Sophia. He has a box of letters that he has written to his late wife, Ruth. Although it is strange that he has all these letters and no one is exactly sure why he wrote them all, it's still cute and makes everyone love him even more. The letters give us an inside view to Ruth and Iras life, which mirrors the relationship of Luke and Sophia. Although the 1940's story is much more engaging, both are stories give you goosebumps. Also, actor Scott Eastwood who plays Luke is son of Clint Eastwood and it shows throughout. It especially shows through when he's wearing his cowboy hat and walking to give a girl some flowers.
The editing in this is very well done and makes understanding the story easier. In the beginning they show Luke getting thrown off the bull and getting severely hurt, then it cuts to a sorority house. This way of editing gets the audience invested in the story and the character. As you continue to watch the movie, characters bring up pieces of the accident from the beginning, but you don't really find out what happened until the climax of the movie.
Another good film technique used by Tillman Jr. is the soundtrack. Going back and forth between 1940s and 2015 is hard, but the music choice makes the transitions flawless. While Ira is reading one of his letters it shows us a flashback to Ira and Ruth dancing. They play the song ""Hi Ya Love"" by Betty Grable which was written in 1945. One thing that took away from the realism of the film is they play this song before World War 2, but in reality it was written after the war had ended. Another example of the soundtrack having an effect on the movie is when Sophia starts listening to country music in the car. She has been a city girl her whole life and never listened to country music, but as soon as she starts to fall in love with a cowboy she starts listening.
The setting throughout Longest Ride really gives the movie the finishing touch. It takes you all around their small town in North Carolina. First we see the rodeo, which is accurate to real rodeos and is where Sophia and Luke meet. We also get brought to the Lukes magical ranch, it gives us the small town vibe and makes us feel at home. Some of the best parts of the movie happen at the ranch which makes us love it even more. One scene that is done especially well happens at this ranch. Luke and Sophia are riding horses together and there is a pan shot that shows them riding horses and being the cute couple they are. Afterwards they show Sophia in the other room, but it's from the perspective of looking through the window panes which are blue and red. This technique gives variety to the audience's eyes and is something not many other films use.
The Writer, Nicholas Sparks is known for his romance films. The longest Ride is very similar to The Notebook. Both films have writing from the 1940's that are used to tell great love stories, that may or may not have a happy ending. These type of movies are a Sparks classic, which is why it was interesting they picked Tillman Jr. to direct as this is not his normal movie type. He has directed films like ""Notorious"" which is a thriller and ""Faster"" which is a drama about crime. George Tillman Jr. miraculously pulled it off and made this better than some of his other work.
At the end of the day Longest Ride is the best romance movie I have ever watched. Not only do you get to watch two adorable couples fall in love, but it has some tension with Lukes injury and the not knowing of whether or not they will end up together."
" A movie I typically drown in
",-0.5719,0.9678,2018-09-25 00:00:00,10,"I love all of Nicholas Sparks books and movies, this is not an exception. The cast makes the movie even better for their good acting and chemistry. Classic N.S. movie, would totally recommend if you like the genre, and if you don't I would recommend you to try it either way. Enjoy and get ready for some tears."
" Better than most Nicholas Sparks adaptions
",0.4404,0.9972,2018-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Well this was better than a lot of Nicholas Sparks adaptions but also filled with all that you've come to expect from one too. Its the usual angsty star crossed love affair with two stories in one -which is actually what made this movie.Scott Eastwood takes the leading hunk role as Luke Collins, a former bull riding champion trying to make a comeback on the rodeo circuit and Sophia an art student preparing to seek her future in New York. As these lovers from different worlds try to forge a future together they find inspiration from a fateful meeting with Ira (played brilliantly by Alan Alda) which has them learning about his decades long romance with his wife Ruth through old letters. We the viewer flashback to the 40's & 50's to witness their love story. Yes its reminiscent of The Notebook but if I'm honest despite the eye candy of Scott Eastwood I think I preferred the well played story of young Ira (Jack Huston) and (Oona Chapman) as Ruth. Their story felt more developed and less cliché.The bull riding sequences are pretty good and Scott Eastwood.... nice he has decent chemistry with Brit Robertson as Sophia. Suitable angsty but not terrible."
" The best Nicholas Spark novel movie I've seen
",0.8126,0.9283,2018-01-19 00:00:00,6,"Okay I've hated all other Sparks movies so far; The Notebook, Safe Haven, The Last Song, etc. This one was different. The storyline was so good, it was genuine. Though the whole bull rider thing was a bit weird, but that's on the novel. I liked the switches between both stories too; both were lovely. The only thing I found was that I felt as if the end of Ira's story was a bit rushed. Decent movie."
" Ignores the elephant in its room so completely that it somehow powers through to reasonable effectiveness
",-0.2732,0.9953,2017-12-09 00:00:00,8,"For this reviewer at least, a film with a good part for Alan Alda can never be judged a dead loss, and this is the case in George Tillman Junior's bringing to the screen of Nicholas Sparks's novel ""The Longest Ride"". Somewhat artificially, Alda as the ageing and now-hospitalised Ira Levinson tells his long story of love and WW2 service and injury by having letters written by his younger self (ably played by British actor Jack Huston) to his escapee-from-Austria girl Ruth (Oona Chaplin) read by University student of Polish extraction Sophia (Britt Robertson).In some measure, the story of Ira and Ruth is paralleled in our time by that of the people who have rescued the former from his car accident, i.e. Sophia herself, and her newfound guy Luke (as played by son of Clint, Scott Eastwood).In fact, there's quite a bit of cliché and syrup in there, as well as heavy doses of hopeless love, lost love, regained love, forbearing and sacrificing love, resentful love, career versus love and so on, and not all of the contexts are especially plausible or well-done. Ira's GI wartime recollection in particular begs a military historian's question as to where and how, while the ending looks a mite too mushy and ""just-so"" to tolerate readily.Ironically, given this sketchiness, the one (major) aspect of the film rendered with remarkably raw clarity and authenticity - indeed in near-documentary style - is the above-mentioned ""elephant in the room"", i.e. the fact that Luke is a cowboy-rancher (albeit one from North Carolina!), and in fact a Professional Bullrider of America. Given that this is a man who (repeatedly) seeks to remain for at least 8 seconds on a bull which really DOES NOT want to be ridden, it might well be argued that at least 78% of the potential audience for a film of this otherwise-romantic genre has been lost right there! An interesting (possibly even courageous) approach from the makers, then? Clearly, this ""sport"" has at least a measure of cruelty associated with it, and it is shown here in pretty exhaustive detail, in what is in no way a critical presentation.After some soul-searching and with misgivings, my wife and I powered on through this, deciding to accept the core of the Sparks story as it was designed to be, (from our point of view) warts and all.And the film of course does likewise, not offering the slightest suggestion that what is being portrayed might be for some - indeed many - controversial or questionable, or simply archaically other-worldly and aberrant.And it has to be conceded that the self-belief present in the piece does achieve a lot in emerging triumphant from the mix of possible tastelessness and implausibility. Alda does his job as well as may be expected, and the just-meant-to-be Robertson-Eastwood pairing of opposites has both its personality-related and physical attractions (needless to say, the film eventually finds an opportunity to depict them unclothed, and it's easy enough on the eye).So, those who come to ""The Longest Ride"" expecting a tearjerker love story (in fact two love stories) with frills attached, will not I feel be disappointed, albeit with the big proviso that they can handle the bull-riding subject matter - and that is a rather big ""if"", I believe."

",0.0,0.8815,2017-08-05 00:00:00,9,"We are given an extremely touching love story and another sweet one, but perhaps the one we expected to keep our attention was not the one that really tugged our hearts.Brit Robinson and Oona Chaplin were endearing each in a different way as the leading women. Alan Alda was quite good despite his years.The ending was almost what I expected, but not quite. Even so it brought some tears. Overall, the story had plenty to keep us engaged."
" Best ride ever - great story line and excellent acting
",0.9186,0.9935,2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"Really this is not a cowboy story, The Longest Ride shows you with cowboys and horses, its far from that. Boy meets girl. Boy is a cowboy rides bulls, girl Sophia is in college focused on working with art. She basically meets boy by accident as a friend drags her to the rodeo.Sophia meets the gorgeous cowboy Luke played by the scrummy yummy Scott Eastwood oh still my heart (even at 66 lol). He takes Sophie home, on the way their worlds collide with Ira an older guy in a car crash, played expertly by Alan Alda and their lives entwine. Yes there are some cowboy meets, love some of the rodeo stuff but there is another story going on about the love that Ira had with his late wife Ruth. The stories almost mirror what is going on in the young couples lives. I think the casting of Jack Houston as a young Ira was brilliant as he really looked like him. I cried oh boy did I cry even when it wasn't sad. I defy anyone to watch without grabbing the hankies. To say I loved it is an understatement, i shall watch it again, its a great watch for male or female as its a Neo Western romantic drama film. The Bull Riding is pretty intense in some places had me on the edge of my seat. I don't see how anyone could not like this film. Its worth a watch."
" A cheap tear-jerker.
",0.0,-0.6834,2017-06-29 00:00:00,2,"Just as all other Sparks' cheap harlequins, the film features a second-hand plot, shallow characters, utterly horrible writing (the film kept me smirking throughout) and a lot of manipulative strategies aimed to jerk a tear or two out of unsuspecting viewers. Not to mention abundant sexist themes which even I found downright offensive despite being quite insensitive to these as such (as they were not a part of jokes but rather a part of the universe Sparks imposes upon his readers/viewers).Must watch. Not."
" the movie was perfect, emotional and such an inspiration
",0.8271,0.9153,2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,This movie was something else.It was so special and i loved it. SERIOUSLY watch it .It is such a huge inspiration and it shows just how much you should be living your life.I rate this movie 10/10 as it was one of the most heart warming and spectacularly touching movies of all time .
" Entertaining, Could have been better
",0.7003,0.9905,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"The Movie is beautifully made, from the gorgeous scenery to the correlation of the two stories to some pretty good performances. Jack Huston, Oona Chaplin and Alan Alda all gave decent acts, Britt Robertson also was good, fitting the character.on the other hand, for a 2 hours 3 mins, the story was supposed to be more in depth, more touching, not saying it wasn't but when you have plenty of running time it should be a bit more. Also, the old love affair was incredible and well played, I think giving it more time should have been better.Scott Eastwood, apparently, didn't just inherit the good look of the great Clint Eastwood, as his performance was very good, specially on how he delivered with relatively little words, a potential star in the making. He made my day .."
