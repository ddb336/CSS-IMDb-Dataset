" my favorite movie out of the conjuring series(conjuring 1 conjuring 2 & annabelle)
",0.4588,0.9228,2021-03-28 00:00:00,7,It was very cute. I loved the tender scenes with ed and lorraine. I will admit that it was not that scary and they couldve done a lot more with the crooked man idea but it was definitely not a bad movie.
" I liked it better than the first one
",0.6908,-0.1397,2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"The first one for me, was to predictable as it was basically a homeage to all horror movies before it.
This one worked a little better for me as you generally feel for the family being plagued by the evil presence.
Is it scary? Well if you, like me, have seen 100s of horror movies, then no. But it has its moments and besides from one scene, thankfully it doesn't use jump scares.But please stop pretending it is based on real events.... It is based on real people who have made up a story. Not on real events that have actually happened."
" I liked it, but I was expecting something even better, and I have some doubts about the script.
",0.4497,0.9975,2021-03-14 00:00:00,6,"I loved the first movie and honestly had good expectations for this sequel. I don't know if that was what clouded my judgment or not, but the fact is that I was a little disappointed: I was expecting something more that I'm not sure what could be, but that never come. However, I admit that the problem may be more in myself than in the film.The film begins by taking a very brief approach to the Amityville case, which is already quite retold in cinema, as we know. Starting from these initial scenes, we accompany the Warrens, a famous couple of psychic investigators, to the United Kingdom, to investigate the famous Enfield haunting, which has also been previously dramatized. And here begin my questions and doubts: wouldn't it have been better to leave Amityville aside and think of another way to start the film? It doesn't seem that difficult, and it would remove from the film the strange feeling that it wanted to address two supernatural cases at once. And one more thing: after some reading, I realized that the Warrens' has had a very minor participation in the investigation of the Enfield case (which almost everyone today considers to be a forgery). Wouldn't it have been more interesting to address a case that the Warrens had really studied, and that was perhaps not as famous and as clearly false as Enfield's?Overall, I liked the movie. To say otherwise would be to lie. It is an elegant film, which fulfills what it promises and knows how to present itself as a solid production and stand out from the immensity of low-budget indie films that abound in the horror genre. It also seemed like a worthy successor to the first ""The Conjuring"" film. But I really lacked something, as I said before. I liked the way it builds tension and the atmosphere of suspense is genuine and solid. However, most scares are predictable and there is not much original. Another problem I felt was the uneven pace and the length of the film. The beginning is too slow, it takes a long time to introduce the story and an infinite amount of time passes before things start to ""warm up"". Afterwards, everything happens so quickly that we hardly have an opportunity to taste the fear.Skillfully directed by James Wan, the film retains the participation of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson from its predecessor. Already familiar with their characters, they do even better than in the first film: Wilson is the one who has evolved and improved the most, but it is still Farmiga who steals the attention and dominates the film, with a great presence and a very competent performance. Frances O'Connor was also very good and professional in her role. Madison Wolfe and Lauren Esposito are also okay. Simon McBurney could have been better, but it seems to me that the script didn't give his character as much attention as the one he really deserved.At a technical level, it is a film that justifies every cent of its budget: the CGI and the visual and sound effects are the best that was available to Hollywood and works fine, blending perfectly with a cinematography that captures the foggy London environment and loads it with more shadows and darkness whenever it is opportune. The light and the absence of it is, in fact, one of the elements that most helps to build fear in this film, as well as the sound, the sound effects and a subtle and more skillfully designed soundtrack than the one that was used in the first movie. The design of the monsters and demons worked perfectly, especially the nun, and the design of the sets is excellent."
" Far from accurate!
",0.0,0.9146,2021-03-14 00:00:00,2,"This film is way too made up. They embellished way too much about the Warrens. Let the Warrens stand on their own merit. They were amazing. As for the ""R"" rating.... why???? Pg-13 at best"
" Just as intense as the first!
",0.1511,0.7827,2021-03-08 00:00:00,7,"This is another great entry-level horror flick, and I think ups the ante compared to the first in this series. Things build at a solid pace much like the first film, and the added element of ""are they faking it?"" adds a separate kind of suspense to the watch. The easter eggs throughout the beginning of the film are also very fun and interesting when you catch them upon re-watching, but after a second viewing most of the twists aren't so twisty anymore. Still a good one to watch with friends new-ish to horror!"
" It's Better then the first
",0.4404,0.921,2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,"Conjuring two is scarier than the first and has a way more intelligent plot. Plus it brings a lot more scary characters. Like the nun, and the crooked man. Overall Conjuring two is one of those movies that shows sequels can be just as good as the first. I was really impressed, and again the fact that this based off a true story sends chills up my spine. I recommend you watch conjuring two."
" A solid sequel
",0.1531,0.4203,2021-03-06 00:00:00,7,"Though not as good as the original, the Conjuring 2 follows suit nicely. It's well produced and the cast is quite good. Nothing ground breaking story wise, but the quality of the film overall is miles ahead of the usual movie of the genre."
" Stop reviewing this movie because you're angry that it WAS a true story.
",-0.4019,0.6336,2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"I find it funny that people are attacking this movie because they don't want to accept that this was based on true events coraborated by many eye witnesses. Why?...are you upset that there could REALLY could be a God or supernatural forces that are good and/or evil?
Anyhow, the real point here is, this is supposed to be a movie review site, not a critique on the motives of the movie maker. Stop trying to lash out because you are angry over the fact that you think the producers of a movie had some sort of agenda about forcing religious beliefs on the audience. Whether this is true or not shouldn't have anything to do with it. Rate the movie based on the things that a movie should be reviewed on...acting, plot, score, special effects, etc.
As far as that goes, the movie delivers. It will scare the crap out of ya, for starters, therefore, it does what a scary movie is supposed to do. The acting is good. It won't win any Oscars, but it's good. The story is good even if it wasn't a true story, so relax. My only warning here is, don't let any young children watch this or they'll be sleeping in bed with you for years...yeah, it's that scary. So, lighten up....don't get in a twist because you think some movie producer has some plot to convert the world to Christianity."
" Frighteningly good flim!
",-0.126,0.6928,2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,"I'm a huge horror fan but movies on the paronormal always scare me the most i was plesantly surpirsed on how good this movie was, right on par with the first. The conjuring 2 didn't relay on too many cheap jump scares but just enough well placed in tense scenes to have you on the edge of your seat. The acting was amazing well, I'd definitley recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good scare."
" Terrible
",-0.4767,-0.8261,2021-02-28 00:00:00,4,This movie is so much worse than the first one. It has no plot. Just terrible.
" GREAT MOVIE
",0.6249,0.8176,2021-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Ed and Lorraine Warren travel to North London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a supernatural spirit. With his latest sequel, James Wan has mastered the horror genre, infusing traditional jump scares with genuine character development and stakes. The movie boasts of strong performances and a gleefully unsettling mood. The Conjuring 2 is an amazing sequel of a great movie.
Rating: 8,6"
" A lame attempt at a sequel
",-0.4215,0.887,2021-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Firstly, Ed and Lorraine Warren are truly controversial figures. Many people, including myself, believe they were basically snake oil salesmen, cashing in on the hippy spiritual culture of the 60s-70s.
That being said, the characters portrayed in the film are okay. I would have liked them to be less Pius but I suppose that was part of the Warrens' schitck irl.
Conjuring 2 portrays the Warrens as having WAY more involvement in the London case than actually occurred. In reality, they were there less than a week and basically told everyone it was all a scam put in by some mischievous kids and a gullible mum. Btw, it actually was faked, as admitted by the kids later in life.
I really enjoyed the first Conjuring, it had a very classic 70s horror vibe, combined with the special effects tech of the 21st century. I felt like this sequel was an attempt to cash in on the success of the first movie and it showed. The story felt rushed and not well thought out, even without knowing all the actual facts, the same way Annabel: Creation sucked but Annabel Comes Home was much more put together.
The writers are definitely attempting to cash in on the entire Conjuring franchise (conjuring; annabel; the nun) and I don't blame them nor do I mind, as I am a horror fan, but I really would like to see them elevate their game and make these truly ""pee your pants"" scary and not just a weak popcorn flick, the way Conjuring 2 was..."

Ed and Lorraine Warren travel to North London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a supernatural spirit
.The Conjuring 2 is a period piece horror film that continues the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two demonologists who are most well known for their investigations into the Amityville haunting. The first film was set before Amityville and concerned one of their lesser known cases. This film is set after Amityville, and mainly concerns the Enfield Poltergeist.
That being said, this is an incredibly effective horror film, and some moments definitely caused me to feel incredibly anxious, and I frequently felt the need to push against the seat to get as far away from the screen as possible. The family is incredibly charming and likable, and the acting, especially the main girl character, I found to be quite impressive. There is also a carryover story from the first film concerning the Warren family, as they question the reason why they do what they do.the nun in this movie is really freaky and the crooked man is so scary as well as he comes out of the tent from the children's toy. This film is set 6yrs after the original film and it only gets better its unusual for horrors to be"
" One of the best in the 'Conjuring universe'
",0.6369,0.9891,2021-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Based on 'true' events, The Conjuring 2 is centred on a 1977 case of paranormal activity which took place in the London Borough of Enfield. The Hodgson family, comprising of mum, Peggy, and her 4 children, were an ordinary, working class family. That was until unexplained occurrences began. When younger daughter, Janet had obviously become subject to some form of demonic possession, the Warren's were eventually called to travel to London to try to help the family.The script is really well written. It has a way of tapping into the viewer's brain and putting images on the screen that's just find fascinating. Wilson and Farmiga were both great at playing the real life Mr & Mrs Warren, as they have a great chemistry. However, the performance that absolutely stole the film though was from young Madison Wolfe as the Janet Hodgson. Of all the possession movies, i think she has been one of the most genuine and realistic. Her dramatic/emotional scenes were very convincing, and the scenes when she was possessed looked and sounded incredible. She was very impressive. The story is solid and comes around with a few creative twists and turns. James Wan's direction is exceptional because he has successfully maintained a realistic tone for this film. He proved himself yet again with amazing ideas and cinematography showing what it may have been like in that house at the time. Although evidence since has shown that the case was probably a very convincing hoax, for the purposes of the movie the paranormal events really did happen. Overall, a really good horror movie."
" Brilliant Sequel

" A Hodgepodge of Cliches
",0.0,-0.9683,2021-02-03 00:00:00,4,"The reviews for this movie, and to a lesser extent the first one, have always confused me. Neither movie is bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't find either to be anything special either. The stories, characters, and a majority of the scares are pretty standard horror movie fare and do little to conjure (I'm sorry I had to do this) any scares from me. The Conjuring 2 is well put together from a technical sense and the acting performances are serviceable for the horror genre but so much of the content is an old hat for horror veterans. There are a couple of solid scares but most of the rest are predictable and fall flat. I appreciate that the Conjuring series has brought a lot of new eyes to the world of horror movies, but I fear that they just aren't for me."

" Based On The Enfield Haunting.
",-0.2732,0.8646,2020-11-24 00:00:00,6,"For a modern ghost film...this is pretty damn good!It is loosely based off of the true story of the Enfield haunting- which is one of the most documented cases of poltergeist activity in the world.The filmmakers do a pretty good job at staying true to the story- with the whole nun-demon angle tied in for dramatic purposes.Unfortunately, for this case, it became a media frenzy.They brought in kooks, psychics, and ultra-skeptics, alike...and made the whole thing a total crapshow.The whole story begins around Christmas 1977, when a girl named Janet- and her family- start to be tormented by an unseen entity.Janet starts sleepwalking; beds shake inexplicably; and, eventually, Janet starts to speak with the voice of an old man.She claims she is Bill Wilkins, who died in the chair in the corner, from a hemorrhage, at 72 years of age.Information that is later corroborated by the former owners son.Not only do her siblings and mother witness these strange occurrences...but a local police constable, daily mirror reporter, and Maurice Grosse, from the Society Of Psychical Research, do as well.Eventually, the Church is called in.They send a couple of their own investigators in to judge the veracity of these claims. As the Church does not want to embarrass itself by involving itself in a fraudulent case.The film ties this into one of their previous investigations- with the woman (who's a psychic) having had a premonition that seems to be coming to fruition here.And they try to help the spirit of Bill Wilkins cross over.But it becomes evident to them, that the force behind this activity is not actually the spirit of Bill...rather, something much more demonic in origin.Cue the spiritual battle between the Church investigators and this demonic nun-entity.For the most part, this is a pretty great film.Well written and constructed...it really manages to keep you engaged.Coming off as The Entity meets The Exorcist.Though, the ending gets a little too Paranormal Activity for me.While more tastefully done than Paranormal Activity...it has some similarities...though, I kind of liked how they wrapped things up (seeing as I have a demon haunted painting, myself)...6 out of 10."

Perhaps I was desensitized by the first Conjuring, but this movie didn't seem to hold up to the scare factor, and to me it felt like it relied on more gimmicky things to invoke a viewers reaction.It felt like the pacing was off, it jumped into the family consulting the demonologists far too early. It felt like the original Conjuring was paced better, whereas this family immediately had people to take care of the issue."

I also thought certain parts of the plot could've been developed more as they seemed a bit rushed. There were not as many horror moments as the first movie and they didn't make me scared or have shivers. Overall I feel this is just one of those typical mediocre horror films which is really disappointing because I liked the first movie."

" Worthy sequel
",0.4404,0.996,2020-10-03 00:00:00,6,"The Conjuring was a stylish horror film with good cast, and even though it wasn't very unique in the genre, it was pleasant to look at. The sequel lacks a little bit of that visual appeal but on the other hand the story is maybe even more interesting. The special effects and monster moments are mostly pretty good. The only thing I didn't really care about was the ""crooked man"" which was a cheap looking cgi monster and pretty useless character anyway.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are again great in the lead roles and their chemistry is excellent. I also liked the brief moment in the end when Wilson's character Ed returns home to the trophy room filled with all those paranormal relics of previous haunting cases. That scene made me wish for more sequels. It definitely feels like a continuous franchise. These are characters I like to spend time with. Also that museum room is similarly cool like the university where Indiana Jones works before heading again to a new adventure. Well, what do you know, as writing this I noticed there is already a third movie on the works, and I also realized ""The Nun"" and ""Annabelle"" films also have some connections to these films, so I guess I need to check out those too.Overall ""The Conjuring 2"" is definitely recommended for fans of the first film and haunting/possession movies in general. Not super original but it has a little bit better acting and more relatable characters than in your average monster movie."

",-0.3182,-0.8114,2020-09-11 00:00:00,7,"Conjuring 2 is the sequel to the above average horror movie conjuring 1 which I liked for it's lack of unneccessary forced horror and instead the characters wouldn't act incredibly dumb and it doesn't even seem so unrealistic with the religious theme.I gave conjuring1 6/10 for it's great take at the horror genre which is very hard to do right because the few people that actually watch it have very different interests.But a movie that has an R rating without much violence, blood, sex/nudity, or death must be somewhat thrilling.
But to me conjuring 1 wasn't really scary and it felt a bit long for the little that happened.Conjuring 2 takes the concept of conjuring 1 (first family being haunted then ghost hunters coming and fighting it) and makes a story about a more powerful entity that is actually dangerous to our exorcist / ghost hunter coupleBut we receive new concepts as well, being the big view on proving the supernatural and giving our entity more of a personality.Conjuring 2 is a lot scarier than conjuring 1 (I always watch these movies alone in bed at night so if they don't scare they aren't scary).
and the new demon Valak's design is the most terrifying I've seen in horror movies so far except the thing.Also the acting in general but especially of the child is phenomenal.Conjuring 2 also doesn't force our characters to make some bs decisions so the plot can continue like in the nun and even the movie the nun was spared with too much idiocy.Forwarding to the style, the scenes filmed in ego perspective were absolutely thrilling as well as the few but very effective jump scares.In conclusion I recommand this movie to anyone interested in horror to get scared or fans of the genre that all have aready seen it.I'm definitely gonna see conjuring 3 if they next one improves upon this movie it could be the first horror movie ever to get 8/10 by me.
This movie wasn't so far away."

" A major downgrade from the original
",0.3182,-0.8659,2020-07-03 00:00:00,6,"The Conjuring 2 is a sequel to the acclaimed original, which is once again directed by James Wan. The basic premise of another haunting in a single mother's household in England sounds interesting at first sight, yet slows down over time. The 2 hr 14 min runtime makes the pacing feel slow and the simple plot dragged to the point of boredom. There's a few decent scares that almost capture the terror of the original, but it mostly comes down to cheap jumpscares and ""spooky "" images. Overall, this sequel left me extremely disappointed and worried for the future of the franchise if even a main entry can't deliver."
" Better Than the Original
",0.6369,0.9613,2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,"This film really works hard to not be a carbon copy of the original film, and it pulls it off well. It does a fantastic job at balancing characters and character development alongside the scares and isn't afraid to take a moment or two to show us some true humanity in between bone-chilling scenes.
Perhaps it was after Annabelle came out that Warner Bros. decided to expand the concept into an entire ""universe,"" because this film, while being a film that can be enjoyed on its own, does a fantastic job of setting the stage for some of the films that would come in the future.
Watching the films in chronological order, this one definitely feels like it's setting up the future instalments more than any of the others. The stakes are higher, the suspense is stronger and the Warrens are ready to rise to the challenge.
Really the only downfall of this film is its hideous use of effects at certain times. Some of these scenes look like they were shot right at the end when the budget was really starting to dry up and the producers needed to go as cheap as possible. They were distracting and took me out of the film but, in general, I think they handled the material pretty well.Of course, there's undoubtedly a lot of changes from the actual events as they occurred, either for scares or drama (as there undoubtedly were multiple changes made in the translation from reality to the story the Warrens would tell everybody about what happened... if, in fact, anything actually happened), but the way the story was told and the details didn't take away from the film in general.James Wan knows what he's doing and I hope to see him working on more films in this universe in the future."

" The conjuring 2
",0.0,0.9927,2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"The Conjuring 2 doesn't waste time in bringing the scares in. By that, I mean you're pretty much in the thick of it from the get-go, being given some background (via another very notorious haunting incident) for what is to follow.The Warrens are sent on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which is whipping up a media storm in Enfield, England and, as per the first movie, they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation. Once again, a family is being haunted and they fear for their sanity and lives. There are a few new twists this time round, so all does not play out as before - but it's not a complete departure from the format, which might have made it a bit more gripping in places.James Wan's trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that.What's really enjoyable about this movie, is its nostalgic recreation of 70s England. Wan has really done a great job of this, which is surprising given that he's not from there. Also, the central support role of Janet Hodgson is pretty crucial to empathising with the Enfield family and Madison Wolfe gives a solid performance.It's arguable this one is as strong as the first. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed part one, or indeed likes movies of a haunting or possession theme.Some awesome, unsettling and creepy music in places too."

Hint: Some terrible events have taken place in a very familiar house. Director James Wan pays homage once again to horror films of yore.Soon, the Warrens find themselves in Enfield, England, where a single mum (Frances O'Connor) and her four children are apparently under attack by something from beyond. This time, it's either a hoax, or the most bizarre and dangerous manifestation the Warrens have ever faced.Wilson and Farmiga play their roles with such ease, it's absolutely believable that they're a long-married couple. The British location works well, and setting it in 1977 gives it a nostalgic feel, like in the first film. In this movie, we get not only possession, but actual entities for the Warrens to deal with. The fantastic Bonnie Aarons is on hand to play a demonic creature with a very bad ""habit"", and Javier Botet embodies a gangly monstrosity that seems as though it could only be 100% CGI! Wan turns a smallish apartment into a house of horrors, and reminds us how a good sequel is made..."

Off to the review: The Conjuring 2 improves on its predecessor with a more gripping story, ratcheting up the tension and scares, better performances, improved blend of scary moments and quiet moments and a genuinely menacing villain. To cut a long story short, this third entry in the franchise avoids reiterating the same information as its direct predecessor and creates an atmospheric, exhilarating horror-thriller that enhances its direct predecessor's merits just the way a sequel should."

Unlike the predecessor where the horror and terror was primary, this film has given weight for many other aspects as well.Still James Wan has brought his signature moves to keep the film alive and powerful.Not scary as the hype in my perspective.

" Not half bad!
",0.484,-0.2908,2020-02-16 00:00:00,6,"The second cinematic film in the Warren cinematic universe, this movie starts where other movies like The Amityville Horror take hours to show. Yes, the Warrens really did go to 112 Ocean Avenue. The jury is, however, out as to whether Lorraine had a vision of the murders, followed the ghost of one of the Lutz children into the basement and then met Valak the Nun, who would go on to be in her own series of movies.The ghost boy is based on the infamous Amityville photo - you know the one, it wasn't shown until years later when the first movie was on its PR tour.The movie then moves on to another paranormal case, the Enfield haunting of 1977. Janet Hodgson - while sleepwalking - would speak in the voice of an angry elderly man. The Warrens are determined to save her and her family, while Lorraine is concerned that Ed will be killed.In addition to introducing the Nun character, this movie also has an appearance by the Crooked Man, who will obviously soon get his own Conjuring universe movie, alongside Annabelle (Annabelle, Annabelle: Creation, Annabelle Comes Home) and La Llorona (The Curse of La Llorona).I was happy to see Franka Potente in a movie. She was such a force in Run Lola Run and its a shame she isn't in more movies. Here, she plays Anita Gregory, a real-life scientist who was a member of the Society for Psychical Research that investigated the Enfield Haunting.This was directed by James Wan, who always adds a layer of sheen and class to his horror proceedings. He's learned a ton since the Saw films and hey - I even like his silly slasher film, Dead Silence. It was written by the team of Wan, David Leslie Johnson (Aquaman, Orphan) and the twin writing team of Chad and Carey Hayes. Interestingly enough, Chad was in Death Spa in his younger days.I also love the art direction in the Conjuring films. The Warren's study is filled with mystical artifacts from their many adventures, like the golden upside-down skull from Vice Versa that caused Judge Reinhold and Fred Savage to switch bodies. There's also a great poster of a young Joanna Lumley from Absolutely Fabulous in the girls' room. You can also spot a poster for Exorcist II: The Heretic in the montage of England set to The Clash's ""London Calling.""Also, just so there's no debate, beyond being a possession movie, an Amityville movie and a movie about situations based on real-life events, this is also a Christmas movie!"

Expertise takes the film out of the picture but, as in the previous production, Wan sins by not delivering an outcome without explaining too much ...Movie seen on January 17, 2020"
" How can the same director get it so wrong?
",-0.6113,-0.6473,2020-01-21 00:00:00,3,"Firstly can I say that The Conjuring - the first movie, was one of the best haunted house movies I've seen, if not the best. While it brought little new to the genre, there is after all only limited scope for this, what it delivered was impeccable, and it avoided using manipulative ""effects"", visual and sound, in order to deliver its thrills.The follow-up, ""The Conjuring 2"", by contrast manages to get everything wrong!For starters in the original, while based on a ""true story"", i.e. the events in the movie were as reported and investigated by Ed & Lorraine, this is irrelevant - it adds little (unless you believe it's all real) and it certainly takes nothing away - the second movie makes it more of a mission statement. For background, the haunting was thoroughly investigated and plenty of evidence came to light that the girls were faking it - paranormal investigators were heavily criticised for accepting that some of the events WERE faked but still believing the haunting was real! The movie faithfully covered all of this and in doing so, destroyed the suspension of belief, viewers are asked to engage when watching this kind of movie. How can you believe the haunting is real, when the movie is showing you evidence it isn't? You end up viewing many of the events as totally laughable - it's rather like Scooby Doo in places!Secondly, the original spent just the right amount of time setting the scene: letting you into the family's life so you like them, and then building up the suspense oh so slowly to the point you are desperate for Ed And Lorraine to get involved and help. The Conjuring 2 however runs two thread plots from the start, one set in England, and one set at the Warren's home - it's not clear at all if they interact, never mind how until the end of the movie. It tries to build up BOTH threads, but as a result it takes twice as long and you end up bored - not just that, but the constant chopping and changing ruins the effect. It's not until the last 30 mins of the 134 min long movie that the action begins and it's over in a trice with a frankly absurd plot suddenly sprung upon the viewer.The setting is problematic, while a remote farmhouse with a foreboding tree next to a still lake gives a perfect background to a ghost story, a 70's council estate really doesn't. OK, so that's where the Enfield haunting occurred, but it makes it all less believable.Finally, the shocks - yes I jumped a couple of times, but that was simply due to cheap effects. The movie isn't remotely scary, well maybe to young children it could be, but to an adult, it's more like pantomime. Nearly everything that is going to happen is predictable, the camera work if nothing else, telegraphs it.
The fact that we hardly got to know the family involved either since most of their lines were simply various types of screaming (yes, there's plenty of that - maybe to make up for the lack of it from the audience?), so it was difficult to care about whether anything happened to them anyway.In short, while I awarded the first movie 8 and it may even rise to a 9 after a second viewing, this offering is total junk."

" The Conjuring of More Childish Horror
",-0.7559,-0.9169,2019-12-31 00:00:00,3,"The Conjuring 2 is the best example of what's wrong with modern horror. It's formulaic, predictable, uninventive, and only scary if you're a child that is afraid of loud noises and ghost stories. The fact that the Warrens have been proven to be frauds who were attention seekers doesn't help.Rarely have I seen a movie this bland, dragging and unimaginative. The writing left me blase at best, furious at how childish it is at worst. The cinematography is so boring and basic, even TV cooking shows look like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison. After watching the first Conjuring I thought they might do it better this time, but it just keeps getting worse. James Wan is definitely a hack.If you want a really scary movie about evil entities, watch the Spanish masterpiece Aterrados. It's genuinely scary and way shorter than this piece of garbage that is meant to appeal to the gullible masses. All The Conjuring 2 did is make me laugh and holler. It's pure schlock."

" So many logical errors?
",-0.3947,-0.982,2019-12-25 00:00:00,7,"Most modern horror cliches consist same stuff: In the basement of old European or American houses (most likely belong to baby-boomers), there are some paranormal things. Most families that are living in these houses usually have more than one child and one of the child is usually a sleepwalker which is only used to misinterpret the paranormal situation to this natural process. The process that the audience is able to solve, can not be solved by idiot young family members. Horror scenes only works for jumpscare or preparing the jumpscare. Audience knows everything in the movie but characters don't. There are only a few breaking points that twisting the plot. Characters seem like everyday they witness posession of human body by supernatural beings.Man prepares a seance to girl, the house is getting darkened, a demon makes a sound and after one hour, there is still possibility to interpret the situation to neurotic disorder and the man who still think about this possibility is an expert at these kind of situationsThe demon called Valak, is stupid enough to import its name on BibleThere is a neighbour who who witnessed the paranormal situations directly from the girl and that neighbour didn't even tell our protagonists this witnessed situation and took them to station. I thought that there is something wrong with this neighbour but the problem is on the movie.In Lesser Key of Solomon, Valak is 62nd demon. It is greedy, Depicts, on the back of twin-headed dragon. According to some myths, it is the one that offers the apple to Adam and Eve but he was easily defeated by two priests.Horror scenes are thriving, Nun character is really well made and frightening.%10 mystery, %90 horror and shooting techniques."

Just when you think it starts getting somewhere, just like public transport, you're asked to get off and wait for the next bus. By the time it gets going you'll be worn out like spandex corset after award season. It is well made and decently acted but there are so many missed opportunities along the way you're left wondering if it's got something to do with brexit. The ending is anticlimactic and feels like a hand job with no happy ending. I say only for die hard franchise fans. I just didn't care and so shouldn't you."

" To make an event movie out of your basic horror film is no easy feat
",-0.4588,-0.9866,2019-12-13 00:00:00,6,"To make an event movie out of your basic horror film is no easy feat - a genre for everyone it ain't - so kudos to ""The Conjuring"" and its sequel for pulling an ""Exorcist"" and turning even the most hesitant members of the general public into temporary aficionados of the macabre. Three years have passed since the original and nothing's much changed; still intact are lean, mean, and very devilish thrills not to be messed with - James Wan could turn the adventures of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren into a franchise and I wouldn't much be bothered by his audacity. This year's follow-up to the 2013 juggernaut expectedly pales in comparison to its predecessor - how could it not - but it's unusual in that it could very well stand on its own and still be regarded as a solid piece of terrifying exhibition. Success is rare for any sequel to a critical and commercial triumph, especially for the horror genre, and ""The Conjuring 2,"" against the odds, delivers the goods without attempting to outdo or undermine the beast that made it. As the film opens, we find the movie's previous protagonists, the aforementioned Warrens, recovering from the psychological wounds left by their 1976 investigation of the Amityville murders. Ed, per usual, has quickly compartmentalized the case into the deepest pits of his mind, figuring it better to abstain from unhealthy dwelling, but Lorraine, a possessor of psychic powers, has become immensely disturbed by the events experienced in the wretched home. She's considering quitting her self-made profession; she's not so sure she can continue carry the weight of someone else's literal demons. But before she can give her skepticisms too much serious thought, the Warrens are drawn to an intriguing case across the pond. Due to overzealous tabloid coverage, the recent hauntings of the lower-class Hodgson family has become all the rage in town gossip and in news stories. According to several reports varying in their authenticity, Janet (Madison Wofle), the second oldest of four children, has been suffering from strange bouts of sleepwalking and, most dramatically, instances of possession. The flat in which the family's living seems to be tormented by a poltergeist unwilling to leave - and as time drags on, malice increases. Naturally, Ed and (a hesitant) Lorraine take the long flight over in hopes to dig deeper. All that surrounds them, of course, is much more complex than anyone could ever realize. And so retained is the fun of the first ""Conjuring"" in its sequel; it's a skillfully designed and executed horror show with more than a few whodunit undertones lurking underneath its jump scare tactics. We grow to care about its characters just as much the solving of the central mystery, and the Warrens, already such likably offbeat heroes, are provided with increased depth that reminds us that in front of us are not pulpy ghostbusters but genuinely vulnerable people who just so happen to have extremely difficult jobs. So while I'm easily able to admit that ""The Conjuring 2"" is not as spine-chilling as the film preceding it - there's a higher reliance on slammed doors, too-quickly-revealed foes, and generalized possession tropes (and there's certainly no equivalent to the first film's memorable clap supplemented basement scare sequence) - there's no denying that on display is an intelligent horror blockbuster more than likely to satisfy the thirsts of fans of the 2013 film and horror pundits alike."

The film was extremely slow-paced with no jump-scares and left us feeling more like we were watching a low intensity thriller than a true horror. This is based on a true story of a London haunting, however, it is desperately inaccurate to the actual story.Compared to the first film this was a flop. More than two hours long and the plot only begins to take shape an hour in. I don't recommend this if you actually want to be scared and the CGI was disappointing too."

" A horror sequel that - surprisingly - is as good as its predecessor
",0.1027,0.9838,2019-10-30 00:00:00,8,"Following the success of ""The Conjuring"", there are no surprises that James Wan would throw out a sequel in his newly created MCU-esque horror universe. ""The Conjuring 2"" (actually nice to have a horror movie sequel without an overly long subtitle) has the Warrens (Wilson and Farmiga) go across the pond to help an allegedly possessed girl in the oh-so-rainy City of London. The warning signs are clear, this might be a repetitive, dumb sequel. But it isn't. I would probably argue that it is actually better than its predecessor. The pure haunted house kind of thrill is present in this film as well, and the gloomy, grey atmosphere of England (as usually depicted in American films) gives the film an extra spice, separating it both visually and emotionally from the first film. A step up from the first movie is also the supporting cast, the Hodgsons (with its matriarch played well by O'Connor) are utterly sympathetic and it brings an extra thing that is at stake. Let them have a merry Christmas you evil spirits. As for Wilson and Farmiga, they feel like they are warm in their clothes and have a great dynamic, also adding to the likeness of the ensemble. ""The Conjuring 2"" is a very good horror movie, with some very chilling, skin crawling scenes and it serves as a very worthy successor despite the still present lack of originality. I must also admit, as a hardcore horror fan, the few scenes featuring the Nun are almost unbearably intense to watch. So horror fans, enjoy another horror spectacle from Wan.

",0.0,0.5011,2019-10-30 00:00:00,10,This movie was AWESOME!!! I'm a big horror movie fan and it's so rare to find a great one now a days. This movie scared the poop out of me the first time I watched it and I've watched it about five times in two years. The excorcist had been my favourite horror movie of all time for my whole life but I think I've bumped this up to number 1. If you like and believe in those ghosty devil movies this is a must see. Turn all the lights off and crank up the volume and enjoy.
" Pretty much the same as the first
",0.4939,0.8462,2019-10-29 00:00:00,4,"The first conjuring was decent at best, and just more okay overall. This one's the exact same - going through the motions as if youre on an amusement ride on from one excitement to the next. There are several moments in this one that are flat out stupid and bad though to where I burst out laughing, it's much harder to take seriously and feels more like a so bad it's good type thing."
" even worse then the first
",-0.4767,-0.6369,2019-10-23 00:00:00,4,I understand this may be effective for mainstream horror audiences who think goosebumps is scary. this film is worse then the original the story is even more derivative and the acting is awful.the jump scars are in effective and any true psychological horror is non existent. and the evenglical Christian stuff is more cringe then ever. this movie fails on all fronts id recommend it to children under 13 who are easily scared
" Good as previous aka first sequel
",0.4404,0.8934,2019-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Good. Liked mixing religion and science in horror, exactly like in previous sequel. Good effects, realistic, scary, and nothing is overdone. But like first sequel there is still room for improvement, by convincing us bit more and being bit more realistic and less monotonic. Meaning bit more location, people, variety. Bit more logic, science, causative and not sudden happenings. This is one of rare high quality horrors, but still not perfect. Lot of room for improvement, which I hope to see in soon-to-be released 3rd sequel."

I have seen and read numerous reviews echoing that this movie is equally horrifying as it's first part and I also want to be a part of the same gang in fact this is sometimes more scary then it's first part and which is very rare among sequels.The acting was superb by all the characters but specially the possessed girl she was just spectacular.All praise for the director for creating perfect scenes of terror and horror. The background music works as icing on the cake.Overall a perfect scary sequel to watch for."

The story has a lot of audio, pictures and some video evidence of what went on. The movie is just that a movie. Adding more than what actually happened. Same could be said about the first movie but this time is more prevalent. The Warren's really where only there at the end but helped. The addition of the nun and crooked man really takes away from the true horror of the actual events. Definitely a great and creepy movie, very much a great sequel compared to most."

I get to see more of the people and why I should care about them. Like the wife, she has no husband, she is miserable, and I just have to feel bad for that. And the inevitable feeling Lorain has that Ed is going to die is also really nice. She tries to the very end to make sure it doesn't happen, and it doesn't. Great films. One of my favorite horror films ever made. 10/10"

The characters don't do 'stupid things' just to keep the movie going, no cheesy crap to TRY to scare you. With incredibly few exceptions everything is 'purposeful' and nothing takes you out of the movie. You don't wonder 'why didn't they do this?' or 'why did that happen?'I can't begin to count the number of horror movies I've watched, and the vast majority, literally within 5-10 minutes of the movie starting 'force' something to happen to establish the plot, and you never get sucked into the movie. So far both Conjuring movies avoid this and many other common pitfalls of this genre.The only 'negative' is for the whole 'universe' of the Conjuring, the Nun, Annabelle, etc etc, etc, which is the 'spin offs' are almost entirely drivel and have little if any involvement with James Wan."

",0.4215,0.6059,2019-08-25 00:00:00,6,"I'm giving this one more star than I gave the first movie. As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background ""monster"" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.Ultimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.Again, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story. Take it with a massive grain of salt."

A family in England is tormented by a demonic entity. Ed and Lorraine are called to investigate and they cast the demon out.
I liked the acting by all the cast, especially the kids. The sound and special effects were good too. It's a good movie to watch on a rainy night."

The story was engrossing while simultaneously being unpredictable. The acting performances were terrific all around, with Madison Wolfe giving a great performance as the main target of the powerful demon. This movie is easily one of the most horrifying movies I have ever seen, without losing anything in terms of having a touching and complex story."
" More is not always better
",-0.3412,0.9656,2019-07-25 00:00:00,5,"If the first Conjuring was a simple old-school kind of horror movie that resulted in a breath of fresh air, this second part is the opposite.
This tries to be everything the first wasn't:
If the first one didn't rely that much on jumpscares to scare you, but rather in building tension, this one has to have a loud noise every minute.
If the first one was a simple story of a house with a demon, that reached a not so dumb satisfaying climax near the end, this one has to be this grandiosity were people fly and have superpowers and can see the future and blah blah blah.
If the first one had great acting from all (except the family father), in this one the child actors have to suck.
If the first one didn't have an overlong runtime, this has to be over two hoursand twenty minutes.
You get why i'm trying to say? This movie has this aspiration to be grandiose, but it doesn't need to.
I have to recognize the film is not that bad, it has some great aspects like the cinematography, but it doesn't reach the level of the original. You can skip it, or you can watch it, but don't expect anything really good."

It pales in comparison and even stand alone it's quite unbearably boring for the first half of the movie. It's a shame this wasn't handled with more care as the storyline itself showed major potential.Once we reached the second half of the film where the possession has reached its climax and things are truly discovered to be how they are, the film finally begins to glisten in all its glory. It was truly a shame the encounters before this point weren't handled as well as they were in this moment."

After watching conjuring my hopes were extremely satisfied, then Annabelle happened and I was very disappointed... but then I saw in my list of conjuringverse movies that there was a conjuring 2, so decided to give it a watch. And I must say. It's very thrilling and insane, in ways I would argue it's even better than the first. James Wan returns to give us what this conjuringverse needs, especially after the disappointment film that came before it. I can't believe what James Wan did here. It's truly yet another remarkable film to be looked at. I've been watching all these conjuring movies in one viewing. And all at the same day lol, I can't believe how good this was. I can go all day.Acting 9/10

For me its just a lot of scary, jumpy scenes and more like a collection of short stories than one well formed film.
It relies on jump scares and creepy scenes almost to the clock! You know after 10 minutes your going to get a jumpy AND LOUD scene.
So boring and no real content. The only reason i give it 5 is for a couple of scenes that were well done, but again don't do anything to form another layer of the story.
Modern horror at its most obvious. Boring"

",-0.3724,-0.6747,2019-06-24 00:00:00,6,"Unfortunately, this film wasn't as good as its predecessor. It was partly because the jump scares just weren't effective, but most of all it is because it just wasn't convincing. I felt like there was too much of the same thing happening, and it just didn't scare me all that much. But still, if you've seen The Conjuring and want to see where Ed and Lorraine Warren end up next, then you should see it, but just don't expect it to live up to its predecessor."
" Decent Sequel
",0.0,0.987,2019-06-21 00:00:00,7,"This isn't a horror film that will linger quite as long as the first movie, but I'd say it's a worthy successor due to the consistent writing and acting, and also the great scary visuals and well-designed locations. For me, this feels like a perfect 'cold, rainy day horror movie;' it's got enough atmosphere and chills to make you want to curl up in a blanket with your dog and just disappear in some creepiness for two hours, but when that two hour is up, the atmosphere wont latch on to you; it will vanish like dew with the dawn. Overall, its worth seeing if you liked the first one.

I love James Wan the way he portrayed his cast and showed what audience expects... No sudden moves or loud voice, a crisp suspense all the time and jump scares which are new and breath taking. Why 9 because part 1 did had a story built up which was missing in this feature the way it should have been. Anyways, this is called horror. If you love something like this do also check insideous parts, dead silence and saw again from James Wan."

They really took liberties with this one. Ed and Lorraine had to check out the Enfield haunting. The movie added lots of stuff that just didn't happen.
The cast, outfits and setting were all bang on and true to the period. The film, in itself, I felt was overly long.
I loved all the subliminal stuff. (VALAK)
The real voice recording of Bill is truly terrifying.
Patrick and Vera have amazing chemistry.
Worth a watch."
" A little faith goes a long way...
",0.3626,0.7002,2019-06-01 00:00:00,9,"First off let me start by saying that I do not usually enjoy horror films at all. I usually think that they are over done and are saturised so much that they lose their effect, I was one of the unfortunate few that watch Scary movie 2 before seeing the Exorcist, those who know will know.However, the Conjuring 2 has got to be up there with the greats of horror. James Wan has created a perfectly balanced series following the lives and events of the Ed and Lorraine Warren, followers of the occult will know these names well, and it is this that I think the horror genre comes out the strongest, before going into this film you are aware that the characters and in fact the Enfield Haunting are all based on some form of truth. James Wan plays on this very very well, with a talented cast to direct, an era of British history that was one of fear, poverty, dissent and the masters of CGI he brings to life a true horror story.We are first introduced again to Ed and Lorraine in the house of the Amytiville horror scene where Lorraine enters a translucent state to discover what has occurred, from that point you are sitting on the edge of you r seat as she follows the path of the murder throughout the house. She is then thrown into the cellar of the house where she witnesses 'The Nun' stalking her and showing her an image of Ed dying horrifically. This sets the pace of the whole film. Wan then throws us over to England where we meet the Hodgson's, a normal family struggling in a crumbling house and trying to make ends meet, the introduction of a Ouija board then has us drop our heads, it's all downhill for the family from there folks. I will ruin no more but the slow decay of innocence of the kids truly terrifies, the spectral occurrences makes you jump and the ignorance of all around has you shouting at the screen. It makes you realise that the evil powers all but need to play on doubt to truly win.All in all this film is a masterpiece, Wan has created a true horror film in all sense. It is a battle between good and evil which is what horror films should be. I would watch this continuously!"

" Nothing scary about this one
",0.3875,-0.8118,2019-05-25 00:00:00,1,"I'm not a big fan of the Conjuring movies, and their many many spin-offs. They try hard, but don't deliver. They use too many jump scares, and really really bad CGI. I laughed at the ending, because like in the first movie, they really needed to wrap things up and didn't really care about the plot anymore.
The children acted brilliantly, but I couldn't stop laughing during the part with the playing Elvis songs on the guitar part. Why?
I can only say one good thing about this movie, Annabelle and the Nun are a lot worse, and I bet more bad ones are on their way, as long as there are people out there who love over the top bad CGI and jump scares (not me). I like scary movies, but I want them to be original and actually with a good storyline, and not the regular 2010 CGI which is in every horror movie these days."

The answer to that is ""yes."" Under James Wan's direction, even the most clichéd haunted-house tropes (and this movie is bursting with them) are genuinely creepy, and although the movie isn't overly reliant on jump scares, the ones it does use-well, they work. On a lizard-brain level, The Conjuring 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark, and some of its simplest moments-like a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlight-are its most effective, bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and Don Burgess' gloomy cinematography."

" A Mere Coincidence ?
",0.0,0.9891,2019-05-01 00:00:00,7,"I am slightly spooked by something concerning my watching experience of this movie. I watched ""The Conjuring 2"" in two sessions, I watched the first third on 17th April, then the last two thirds on 19th. Then I went online to search for more information about Lorraine Warren, that was when I found out she just passed away on 18th April. Thus, during the time period I watched this movie, she passed away. Was there something that mystically influenced me to watch this movie? I do not know.What I do know, however, is that the movie is pretty good. It's a solid, pleasant surprise that ""The Conjuring 2"", as a sequel, is better than the previous ""Conjuring"" movie. That is why I have decided to check out some other movies of the Conjuring franchise.Now, even if you are not a fan of horror movies, I still recommend you watch this movie, just to enjoy the excellent actings, especially by Madison Wolfe (who plays the main possessee). Wolfe is American; however, her British accent is flawlessly convincing. The emotions she showed in the movie are realistic and impressive. She's brilliant."
" Good sequel but they got cheesy with it
",0.2382,-0.2978,2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"The first Conjuring film was an exagerated take on a real case, as is this sequel. However, the first movie had some form of realism to it. Yes, there were your standard horror possession effects; upside down chairs, detailed full body apparitions and demons... But it was kept to a minimal. It relied heavily on atmosphere and story build up.The Conjuring 2 tries doing the same, but failed in comparison to the first. Additional CGI that was pretty laughable should NOT have been added. The Crooked Man instantly turned the film into what felt like a ""pg-13"" horror film experience.... Turning a somewhat believable experience into a more farfetched hollywood horror film. The parts that freak me out the most in the Conjuring films are the parts where objects move on their own, doors open by themselves and footsteps can be heard where nobody is. People might get bored by that and not find it scary, but I do find that hard to believe considering the atmosphere James Wan has created. Overall, this film had great acting, decent story and some good scares, but I think it would have been better without the CGI scares."
" Terrifying. Vera Farmiga at her usual best.

The first one gave me nightmares and I have a feeling this one will too. I'm more easily scared these days, but this still felt like one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen.The Conjuring 2 was horror film-making at its creepiest best. I felt like I couldn't really come up for air during its over 2 hour duration. The scares and creepy scenes just felt relentless (almost too much so). At one stage, my dog looked at me (with my hands over my eyes) as if to say, ""what the hell is wrong with you?""I'm a huge Vera Farmiga fan, and she is perfectly suited to the role of Lorraine. Patrick Wilson puts in a good performance too, and they share excellent onscreen chemistry. Whether or not you believe in ghosts or this particular case, it was still unbelievably terrifying - particular for me, who grew up in a haunted house.I'm not religious, but the religious element here was done well (without being preachy) and gave a bit of an Exorcist vibe to things. The film felt like a combination of Poltergeist, The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror.It was unexpectedly feel-good too! The ending made me smile and I certainly didn't think The Conjuring 2 would be the most uplifting film I'd seen in recent weeks. In saying that, it wasn't exactly a relaxing Friday night watch.RIP Ed and Lorraine - together again."

" The Conjuring 2 Review
",0.0,0.9951,2019-04-20 00:00:00,8,"This is by far the best film in the Conjuring Universe so far. It's suspenseful and creepy. Let me get some negatives out of the way. There were some shaky cam moments in the beginning of the film that made no sense story wise. 2 of the 4 child actors weren't that good but what do you expect from child actors. The night scenes in the house in the first half of the film were too dark just like the original Conjuring movie but James Wan fixes this halfway through the movie. Now let's get onto the positives. The main cast and most of the supporting cast did an outstanding job in their respective roles within the film. Ed and Lorraine Warren were given better story arcs than the first film. The cinematography was great throughout the film and had some really nice tracking shots that weren't too long and weren't too short. The tone remained consistent throughout the film and the plot was pretty good. I understood what was going on throughout the entire film. The demons in this movie are flat out creepy. The Nun got me every time it was on screen and the Crooked Man's design was great. I swear they used stop motion animation for the Crooked Man. If they did, then they blended his character really well with the live action scenes. The scenes with both those demons added suspense and terror to an already terrifying film. Overall, The Conjuring 2 improves from most of the mistakes from the original film while adding better cinematography, a better supporting cast, and scarier demons."

But here comes the giant NO.
The atmosphere of the film is really intense, we can things we have been afraid as children and desperation.
Valak, enigmatic and powerful demon, who was playing with the family and used a ghost to get his own body. You haven't expected it, have you? All of this, added with an almost iconic soundtrack, which is chilling your back at night.
I've watched hundreds of horror movies, but all of them lacked good acting or good music or just being a horror movie. The Conjuring is definitely a game changer, which sets a very high benchmark for horrors."

There's not really any subtlety to leave the viewer guessing what's going to happen and you can see what's coming around pretty much every turn.The acting is good, but they make it glaringly clear that they're acting, if that makes sense.Not a great sequel, and wouldn't really work on a stand-alone unless you're easily scared. Jumpscares get everybody, and that's the crutch in this film.4/10 but only because the production was pretty great."

" Finally a Great sequel!
",0.6588,0.9855,2018-11-13 00:00:00,8,"The Conjuring 2 is Great! It is my favourite horror movie to date. And that is because of two reasons: James Wan, and because i'm someone that is always open to new pieces of art instead of living in the past like a lot of people. And this movie is truly a piece of art. The painting room scene with the Nun is probably the best made horror scene I have ever seen. It shows James Wan at his best. Wan really knows how to build tension. From the creepy soundtrack that to the silent night scenes. He doesn't show the demons a lot, and that is maybe the best thing of this movie. Because these days movies are all about: Lets give the people all we got! Then they must like it! And so they will come back and spend there money again! Let me give an example: Jurassic Park is a true masterpiece, the Top of what a good action/thriller should be. You don't see the dino's a lot but just enough to be scared and know what they are capable of. The supporting characters also build on that tension by talking about how dangerous the threat is and what it can do, so when you see the T-rex for the first time it feels even more like a true monster that has come alive. Now look at the lates 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' there is a scene were they are fleeing from the bursting vulcano while hundreds of dino's are beside them. It's explosions and dinosaurs everywhere and it makes you look at a dinosaur like it's a crocodile or elephant: it's kinda cool but you have seen it many times. Now let's take that comparison to The Conjuring 2. James Wan doesn't show anything until the last moment, when the tension is so high that you are sitting at the end of your seat and already thougt for at least two times that the jumpscare would come, THEN is the moment that he hits you with a scary demon that creeps out of the dark, ready to kill the only good left inside you. But thats not all. The reason why the painting room is so good imo is because it goes against anything I just said. Wan has let you get used a little bit to the type of scares I just mentioned and then switches it up out of the blue. Normally in most horrors these days, the night scenes are for scares and the day scenes are for a little comedic relieve. But then James Wan gives you the Nun....... the most scary character ever and out of nowhere she is standing in the hallway in the middle of the day! That scares people even more because it is almost like she is breaking into your home. You have gotten so used to the relieve part during the day scenes from this movie and all other horror movies, that it is creepy and unexpected.This movie also had other great essentials for a good sequel: character development, no cameos, a small story and not trying to make it bigger then necessary, good cinematography and a fine plot.This is the best movie James Wan has to give us to date, it is a thrill and deserves recognition. Let's hope the 3e movie will be just as good and not rushed because this one was a succes."

",-0.2263,0.3775,2018-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Although I'm an avid movie-watcher, horror has never been one of my favorite genres. I've found most horror films to be badly written and directed with poor acting, and ultimately unsatisfying and not at all enjoyable.However, both The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are the exception. The acting is excellent: Vera Farmiga is exemplary in both movies, and the rest of the cast perform very well, especially in The Conjuring 2. The story isn't shallow and intended only to frighten as in most horror films, it's deeper and much more carefully written, as if more intelligent thought has been put into creating the dialogue.Although I liked both, Conjuring 2 was for me an even better movie than the first, which is not the case with most sequels."

" great movie
",0.6249,-0.9656,2018-10-15 00:00:00,10,"The Conjuring 2: A Horror Movie Review 
The Conjuring 2: Between the directing of James Wan and the acting of Madison Wolfe, Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson this movie is absolutely astounding. The special effects and the music with the Foley add to the movie and the movie deserves all the credit it gets. This movie is arguably one of the best in the Conjuring franchise with a fabulous plot and incredible acting and it was a box office bonanza. 
Director James Wan and writers Chad Hayes, Carey W. Hayes and David Leslie Johnson craft this movie to not just rely on jump scares and special effects but to rely on the story line and the set and the acting. The story has jump scares and scary special effects, but it is not only that. As far as the cinematography goes, Don Burgess made the scenes detailed but still easy to comprehend. He deserves the credit he gets. 
 Another thing that this movie has going for it is the incredible Madison Wolfe who in this movie was such an incredible little actress for being so young at the time. She plays the lead role Janet Hodgson who is forced into servile work by Valak the demon nun as she is taken over. No one outside her mom (France O' Connor) believes her especially when she fakes an event but it is only to protect her family. Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lorraine Warren (Vera Farminga) are the only people willing to help them when Valak is at its worst as everyone else was churlish toward them. 
The set fits the movie because the house is dingy and dirty. It makes it creepy and more horrifying, and when you hear the creaking of the stairs at night. Or the floor breaking in the laundry room, or the flooding where something could be lurking in the dark water. The filmmakers understand that they cannot beat around the bush with what is happening in this movie, it is intense and powerful as fear is always hovering over you and as you are watching keep you on the edge of you seat. 
The director lets the story grow before solving the problem, the audience see's the film through an outside perspective. The Conjuring 2 send the protagonist Janet and her mother down a hole of demons and dark issues including an almost death situation. The movie's overall message leaves you with a feeling of fear that sometimes things are not always what they seem."

" The supernatural conjured
",0.0,0.9923,2018-10-07 00:00:00,8,"Decided to re-watch both 'The Conjuring' films, with memories of really liking both, after watching, and not liking all that much, 'The Nun' (which was watched as part of my watching as many films of 2018 as possible quest) very recently. Just to see whether they held up, as good as remembered and whether they succeeded where 'The Nun' didn't and didn't make that film's mistakes. On re-watch, 'The Conjuring 2', like its very good predecessor, does hold up very well and actually just as good as remembered. It succeeds splendidly in where 'The Nun' failed and has none of its mistakes. 'The Conjuring 2', like its predecessor, is not a perfect film, but it is very atmospheric, well made and genuinely scary, or at least to me it was. It is a very familiar premise, done to death actually, but the atmosphere stops it from being too predictable and there is enough freshness. As a sequel, it fares very well and one of not many to actually be on the same level as its predecessor.'The Conjuring 2' is overlong, which is its biggest issue. This would have been rectified by 20 minutes being trimmed and the pace of the first act, with a beginning that doesn't attention-grab or unsettle as it should have done, tightened up.Other than those, 'The Conjuring 2' is very good. It looks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The music is haunting and not over-bearing, recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere (which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regard).Script is not too awkward and is structured coherently, with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour. The direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material. The story takes time to unfold but doesn't get dull once it gets going, while the ending is leagues better, much more momentum and the resolution didn't feel rushed. As said too, 'The Conjuring 2' yet again is genuinely scary, with actual tension, suspense and dread, in a palm-sweating and heart-pounding sense at its best, while not relying too much on jump scares (they are there but have build up and were surprising).Found myself liking the characters more than expected. The leads were ones worth caring for, didn't get frustrated with them, wish for more personality or annoyed by them. The antagonist was frightening, was neither over-used or under-utilised and didn't look cheap. The acting also comes off well, especially Vera Farmiga who is superb, Patrick Wilson is even better here, while also impressed with how Frances O'Connor coped with a role that on paper seemed limited. Summarising, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

" Valak's Awakening
",0.0,0.9532,2018-09-23 00:00:00,7,"The thing I like about both Conjuring films is that as much as the films present us with terrifying demons and creatures, it's always been about the Warrens. Ed and Lorraine are the center of the stories even when the focus seems to be elsewhere. Conjuring 2 feels about 35 minutes too long, with a first act that significantly drags, but when it gets going, it sure gets going. This time around the Warrens head to Enfield, London to investigate claims of a poltergeist terrorizing a young girl, Janet, in her family's home. The first hour deals with the family going through it with their own team of London paranormal investigators before it finally reaches the Warrens. Meanwhile, the Warrens, and specifically Lorraine, had the Nun to deal with before heading over. The good thing about these films is that there isn't the cliched ""no one can see the demon but the person being possessed"". The Conjuring 2 comes right out and declares that this particular demon, Valak, isn't hiding his presence. Much like the first film, it comes down to the religious angle of it all, which I could give or take. But I do appreciate the attention to detail, the lack of cliches, and the gorgeous cinematography. While not being nearly as tightly directed as the first, James Wan still has something here and hopefully continues to for years to come.'7.7/10"

The supposed real events were scary enough,I suggest anyone interested In the real story should watch the Enfield haunting with Timothy Spall it's a British mini series that keeps to the original supposed haunting and doesn't need the over the top events that didn't happen to scare,the real story if true is scary enough."
" Suprisingly Good (but not without its faults)
",0.4404,0.9768,2018-08-15 00:00:00,6,"The mere mention of a movie getting a sequel is enough to make people reconsider their life choices. This was how I felt when I heard about ""The Conjuring 2"". It wasn't that I wasn't hopeful. It was just because of the things I had heard about ""Annabelle"" (which I still haven't seen, and have no intention of seeing).However, this was actually a pretty good horror movie.PROS:
To be completely honest, I think this film was a bit scarier than the first. ""The Conjuring"" was a creepy and scary movie, but most of its best moments were shown in the marketing. This movie didn't have that issue, and instead showed us some of the more cliched scares in the trailer, saving the best for the actual movie. There was one jump scare that actually got to me; no joke. I normally hate jump scares, but this one scene in the film is an exception (won't say which scene).Like in the first movie, the overall acting in the film is great. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are both great (again) as Lorraine and Ed Warren. Their relationship was a big part of the movie, and they nailed their performances. Even the children (for the most part) were good in this movie.The character development was still strong in this movie. That was one of the best parts of the first movie, and it's nice to see it present in this film.CONS:
The original film managed to use minimal CGI, which may have been to its lower budget. ""The Conjuring 2"", however, used quite a bit of unrealistic CGI. There were some moments where the visuals were so bad that they almost completely took me out of the movie.One scene gets on my nerves. There is a scene where the main family is being interviewed, and the youngest daughter starts talking like an old man. The older sister is right next to her, but she has a complete lack of expression on her face; she's acting as if her sister isn't being possessed by an old man. It seemed really dumb, and I don't know why the director kept this in the film.Overall, ""The Conjuring 2"" is an uncommonly strong sequel, and the third movie of an ever growing franchise. I can't wait to see more of both director James Wan and the other movies in ""The Conjuring Universe""."
" Laughable direction
",0.0516,-0.7076,2018-08-14 00:00:00,4,"THE CONJURING 2 is a follow up to the surprise haunted house hit and another outing for psychic investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, as played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. Sadly, I'm no fan of these films, finding the direction overblown and the reliance on cliches and pedestrian plotting to be completely off-putting. This unconvincing sequel transports the action to England, where the investigators are shoehorned into the famous Enfield Poltergeist case. They end up bringing their old baggage with them, so this is more about evil nuns and stupid spirits than any attempts at realism. The over-the-top fantasy hauntings involving Farmiga's character never gel with the icy chills of the poltergeist case, and it's one of those Hollywood films that manages to make all of the British accents ring hollow and false. By the end, it's devolved into yet another chased-around-by-CGI climax, just like in the INSIDIOUS trilogy, and my interest had long since waned."
" Who you gonna call?
",0.0,0.7444,2018-08-06 00:00:00,6,"Supernatural sequel The Conjuring 2 is a fictionalised account of the Enfield Poltergeist, which allegedly terrorised the occupants of a council house in Enfield, England in 1977. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who, having decided to take a break from investigating ghosts and demons after the trauma of Amityville, agree to travel to England in a purely observational capacity. Of course, they become far more involved than they originally intended once they see the plight of the family involved, single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), and her four children, Janet (Madison Wolfe), Margaret (Lauren Esposito), Billy (Benjamin Haigh) and Johnny (Patrick McAuley), all of whom have had enough of their unwanted ghostly house-guest.At 134 minutes, The Conjuring 2 is about half an hour too long, and often feels like it is dragging its heels: there's only so many times that we need to see furniture being tossed around or the kids waking up to experience supernatural shenanigans. That said, the film is a serviceable sequel that should please fans of the original and those interested in the paranormal, partly because it is loosely based on fact (with the emphasis on 'loosely'), and partly because James Wan has had loads of practise when it comes to creepiness, the director conjuring up (pun intended) plenty of atmosphere and some well crafted scares. A solid cast also contribute to the film's effectiveness, with youngsters Wolfe and Esposito faring particularly well as the Hodgson sisters, who suffer the most from the haunted happenings.At the end of the day, the film doesn't do anything to rewrite the rules of the genre, but it's a slight improvement over the original. I was entertained enough to want to see what further sequels and spin-offs might hold (the latest being the forthcoming The Nun, which is based on the demon that is causing all the trouble in this film)."

The Conjuring 2 follows a very similar structure to that of the original, but where the original avoided most problems that plague other horrors films, the sequel stumbles onto most of them.The sequel makes two significant errors. Poor child actors and revealing far too much about the spooky entity. The first error, poor child actors, was avoided entirely by the original. The second, inexplicably, has the least capable child actor's character (Billy) stutter throughout the film. Completely unnatural and an unnecessary burden on the actor (and audience). B-B-Biscuits?

Well, OK. This is not a statement I have much faith in at the best of times and I have even less in the case of supernatural films, much as I might enjoy the movie.There was a reasonably well documented ""Enfield Poltergeist"". This film fictionalises, augments, and treats the thing as a genuine supernatural manifestation. It should be noted that the movie, while using some real names, locations and alleged events, is otherwise entirely fictional.Which doesn't mean it's not a good horror film, because it is. It has a stealthy growth of dread, and some genuinely scary moments of which only a couple are accompanied by abrupt blaring orchestral hits. The house interiors are grim (but Dad left, and Mum has no money, so that's OK), and the exteriors are battered by too much torrential rain (and rain which rather too obviously comes from overhead rain gantries, and is there really that much water in Enfield basements?), but the down-at-heel suburbia setting is effectively atmospheric nonetheless.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise the Warrens from The Conjuring, but this film belongs to Madison Wolfe, 13 when this was filmed. I was going to sing the praises of a young British actress, but she is a Louisiana native delivering a perfect suburban London accent as part of a terrific performance of a terrified, haunted, and possibly possessed, child.As horror films go, this one is quite good."

" An accomplished sequel that I enjoyed just as much, if not more than, the first.
",0.7351,0.9719,2018-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Despite the occasional tonal relapse and iffy moment of forced comedic levity, 'The Conjuring 2 (2016)' manages to maintain a consistent level of quality by providing the tension and suspense we've come to expect from this series in spades. It is actually probably scarier than the first thanks mainly to the fact that the threat feels palpably deadly almost right from the start of the stellar set-up. This instalment also manages to create a couple of memorably creepy supernatural creatures that frighten with their superb and unique design alone, yet are still treated with the respect that Wan clearly has for the genre and the general craft - which here he seems to have mastered, able to play the audience like a finely-tuned piano. Character maintains a prevalent factor throughout, though, meaning that we truly care for the people at the heart of these dangerous situations. It's a wonderfully accomplished sequel that I enjoyed just as much, if not more than, the first. Again, one of the best horror features in quite some time. 8/10"
" Almost Too Scary
",-0.4445,-0.2449,2018-01-30 00:00:00,10,Watch this alone in the dark - if you dare. Grabs you and the beginning and keeps your adrenaline going the entire movie - almost too intense.
" Not quite as good as the 1st
",-0.3843,0.1466,2018-01-01 00:00:00,6,"'The Conjuring 2' starts off a little slow and disjointed, but when Ed & Lorraine finally get to London to check out what's happening to a child - Janet - things pick up, with the possessions/hauntings getting more severe.There's nothing that scary here, as far as I'm concerned. It's well directed, shot and acted, but there's no truly terrifying moment. The story makes 'sense' at the end, but still plenty of 'why's left. Decent haunted-house film, but nothing groundbreaking or extraordinary."
" This one still haunts me
",-0.25,-0.455,2017-11-27 00:00:00,8,"We continue on with the paranormal adventures of Ed (Patrick Wilson ) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren of Amityville fame. They are asked to go to Enfield and investigate a haunting or poltergeist case centering around Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) and the spirit of Bill.The film is filled with jump scares, whispers, screams, etc. enough to make it enjoyable.Much of the film follows reported incidents (a bit exaggerated) and the criticism and skepticism of the time (and today). Claims that Janet did the pranks and practiced ventriloquism as well as being caught red handed faking incidents are included in the feature.The film makers took liberties with reports such as the police report that a chair wobbled from side to side, became a chair moving across the room. The role of Ed and Lorraine was minor and I would suggest the reason why they never wrote about it was that until the last half hour of the film, they deemed it a hoax and that last part was Hollywood writers earning their dime. As an entertaining Poltergeist film, it is all that. As to being factual, there have been other films and features on Enfield that are far less horrific and supernatural.Go watch the film for a good scare for the kids, not a docudrama.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."

" A great start to a downhill spiral.
",0.6249,-0.9525,2017-09-24 00:00:00,5,"The movie begins with another clever marketing pitch by James Wan trying to mix Amityville horror in here just like he did with ''Annabelle'', well not that it is horrible, but still seemed quite irrelevant. The beginning is not horrible, rather fast paced, the viewers got to see paranormal activity quickly, which carried on for a good while.What i found really weird was the movie coming to a massive stall in the middle of everything, i do not think i have experienced something quite like this in a film before. In my opinion it was just another cheap shot at extending the screen time, which panned out to be rather sizeable. The first hour had a couple of interesting and witty jump scares, which were quite original and definitely one of the greatest things about this film. Then after we arrive at around the half way mark everything slows down and it seems as if everything has taken a turn and the premise and fast pace of this film have been discarded, which is a massive flop of course.There is a scene in the film, which is going to make any experienced horror film fan cringe, at this point i had to start heavily re-evaluating my thoughts about the film. There is a scene where a dog transforms into the ''crooked man'', from a kids toy game, the monster was a really poor work of cgi, which did absolutely no justice to the tone and tensity the movie had set prior to the scene, it was really cringy, not scary at all and very childish. However, by far the greatest upset for me was the extremely boring and poorly thought through ending. The insanely powerful demon that can easily do anything it wants, including teleportation, transcending time and destroying everything in its way can be destroyed and sent to hell forever by saying its name 2 times? This had me laughing, such a week ending, well at least it was unpredictable, people like unpredictability when it comes to horror films, right? Overall the film starts out great and slowly goes downhill as it progresses. It escalates from witty, unpredictable jump scares and intense atmosphere to lousy cgi work and laughable kindergarten horror, culminating in one of the worst horror film endings i have ever seen in my life. 5/10 for the great first half of this film."
" Liked this even better than the first
",0.6908,0.9824,2017-09-16 00:00:00,10,"I don't get scared by horror movies, but I've enjoyed this series because of the emphasis on likable characters, from the family to ghost-investigator couple. These are good stories, with believable relationships between family members who care about each other, not simply a bunch of jump-scares (although there's that too).As good as the first one was, it was narratively a fairly simple & straightforward haunted house story. I'd rate this one, the sequel, a little bit better because, although featuring a similar premise, it actually goes in a few unexpected directions and introduces additional hurdles for our protagonists.This one also clearly has a bigger effects budget, which doesn't hurt. Many of the effects are really quite creative and visually impressive (e.g., a girl slowly transforming into someone else the unfocused/blurry background); but also some that look a bit more silly than scary (e.g., the Crooked Man)."
" Don't get the hype. Was it a horror game or a movie?
",-0.5719,0.8131,2017-09-15 00:00:00,6,"Hated the movie, for one simple reason. CGI effects. It's not scary when the subject of fear in the movie looks like something that came from a video game, or like a sticker/emoji. It would be a 1000 times more scary if they'd be reasonable enough not to mask everything in effects and jump scares. Jump scares is equal to a comedian tickling his audience. The beauty in horror movies is the tension, suspense, the build up, and the point (in my opinion) is to sympathize with the protagonist, but I can't do that if the antagonist looks like animated version of Marilyn Manson, literally. Make up should cover the scary part, plot-wise it was okay, but nothing I haven't seen before, nothing unique. The Conjuring 1 was way scarier and more interesting than this sequel."

" A strong extension in The Conjuring universe.
",0.5106,0.9526,2017-09-02 00:00:00,10,"The Conjuring 2 celebrates horror in a new taste. It's a successful extension the original movie. Director James Wan knows his viewers and he toys with their 'fairy tale nightmares' as Vera Farmiga remarks it in this sequel. This time the story's set in a council home in England and it's about a poltergeist that torments a family of five. The Warrens this time get into things more gruesome than the last one. James Wan has not taken the recognition of his last work for granted. With this Conjuring he has gone to experiment with his core film making and he's successful in all ways. Actors are all brilliant. Vera Farmiga is a beautiful artist who lives the character of Lorraine. Patrick Wilson, this time is at his best and he totally nails the character of Ed. Young Madison Wolfe is a talent to look out for. She's vulnerable and worth-getting-scared-of at the same time. Overall the movie is worth the hype. The length of the movie however, could have been curtailed but still it doesn't stop this thriller from being one of the best horror movies of all time."
" A Superior, Scarier Film than the Original CONJURING
",0.7003,-0.8797,2017-08-26 00:00:00,8,"I don't generally put a whole lot of faith into horror sequels. More often than not, they're just trying to recreate the success of what made the first film popular and fail to bring anything new to the table. So many of them are unapologetic cash-grabs that I often won't pay attention to news that sequels are in the pipeline, even when I enjoyed the first film. I thought INSIDIOUS was a creepy, fun little film but I never once cared about the second chapter and still haven't bothered to see it. Until just a moment ago, I was completely unaware that there has, in fact, been a third chapter and there's a fourth in production. Speaking of James Wan and Patrick Wilson, the first CONJURING was another decent horror. I think it was over-hyped and I might've gone in with my expectations a little high, but I enjoyed it. I had zero interest in the idea of a second film, believing they'd gone the route of every other successful horror with a seemingly never-ending explosion of sequels and spin-offs (for the record, I never saw ANNABELLE and have no desire to do so) but I was caught off-guard when THE CONJURING 2 started receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and in the end I'm glad I did because I'm actually of the opinion that THE CONJURING 2 is superior to the first film. So I suppose it's a rare exception to the rule.THE CONJURING 2 revisits the case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two of the most famous paranormal investigators. It opens with a glimpse into their involvement in the investigation of the Amityville house, where Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) conducts a séance and comes face-to-face with some sort of evil spirit in the form of an evil nun. Unlike the first film where their Annabelle investigation was just a cold open to introduce the pair in action, the nun becomes an integral part of THE CONJURING 2, tormenting Lorraine long after finishing at Amityville with visions of Ed's (Patrick Wilson) death. It's her confrontation with the nun and these spectral threats that lead her to swearing off hands-on investigations, and she and Ed decide to limit their activity to seminars and interviews. Meanwhile, in England, a new supernatural occurrence has taken up residence in the home of a single mother and her four children. It's set its sights on the youngest daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), and it's not long before her over-stressed mother takes notice and affirms that this isn't a child's prank. Her family is being tortured nightly and Janet is suffering more and more as the entity breaks her spirit in hopes of possessing her body for its own purposes. The misery of a young child proves too much for Lorraine to turn away, and she and Ed jet off across the Atlantic to verify the poltergeist's existence and hopefully get the Catholic Church involved in exorcising the spirit.The Enfield Poltergeist is apparently one of the more famous Warren investigations. I wasn't familiar with the details of it prior to this movie but I had seen the photographs of Janet's supposed levitations referenced before in my limited readings on the paranormal. Of course, the whole situation has been debunked as an attention-grabbing hoax but, for the purposes of this movie, it's all treated as gospel and it makes for a great movie. I remember the first film leaving me uneasy in a dark house when it ended but THE CONJURING 2 was way more effective at leaving me shaken. James Wan is a talented horror director and one of the few out there that can put together a strong ghost story without the reliance on shocking gore or over-used jump scare tactics. He uses camera lenses, lighting, film score, and the performances of his cast to build a sense of dread in a way that many other modern horror filmmakers wish they could. There's a little bit of questionable CG in the film when the spirit takes the form of a children's nursery rhyme named the Crooked Man but it's a minor misstep and I can forgive its cartoonish appearance because everything else works so well. The first CONJURING seems to have soaked all the hype but CONJURING 2 is the one that gets my respect. Fans of the first one won't be disappointed and, for once, I'm eager for a horror sequel and hope they continue digging through the Warrens' files with a CONJURING 3."
" ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING! Even BETTER than the First!
",-0.3583,0.9629,2017-08-21 00:00:00,10,"It's very rare that a horror sequel outdoes its original, and The Conjuring 2 is one of those sequels. Don't get me wrong; The Conjuring (2013) was very scary with quality horror, great acting, and a great plot. But The Conjuring 2 surpasses the story line, overall quality, acting, and most importantly the terror. I'm a big fan of paranormal/horror films, especially those based on a true story and actual events. I loved The Conjuring (2013) so I just had to see The Conjuring 2. And let me tell you...I was blown away (and I had to keep the lights on in every room after watching it).The film starts out with Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) conducting a seance at the Amityville house in 1977. Lorraine, a clairvoyant, astral projects and relives the horrific events - and comes face-to-face with a terrifying, demonic nun (who'll play a bigger role later on in the film). Meanwhile an equally- diabolic haunting is taking place in Enfield, England, where 11-year-old Janet Hodgson is being tormented by a ghost. Ed and Lorraine come to the rescue and things get frightening from there!The first thing I must greatly compliment about this movie is the acting (especially Vera Farmiga's). I was very impressed at how much the cast looked so much like the original people and investigators involved. Each actor and actress was very passionate about their roles and they made things pretty intense - sometimes even emotional. I also loved the realistic visual effects that delivered the activity and scares. The sound editing was brilliant, the soundtrack was eerie and bone-chilling, and the costume design was great (I'm including the costume design because the actors wore what the original persons did during the investigations, making it all the more authentic). Overall, The Conjuring 2 possesses a very eerie, creepy, haunting feeling throughout the film which is rare in today's world of horror movies. It makes you feel tense and uneasy during AND after watching it, as if something dark and inhuman is watching you. I had a hard time sleeping the night I watched it, which almost never happens to me as a die-hard Horror fan. You can tell director James Wan put a ton of time and quality in the making of this one, and recreating the horrific events that happened to Janet Hodgson in 1977. FIVE STARS and 10/10! I highly recommend it! I can't wait for The Conjuring 3 as well as the confirmed spin-offs (""The Nun"" and ""The Crooked Man"")"
" Classically superb set piece!!

This is a classic set of horror piece which is exemplary."
" great horrorverse

After the incident, they are attacked for participating in a hoax. Lorraine is haunted by the nun and visions of Ed's death. She convinces him to stop. Meanwhile in London, the Hodgson family is suffering from a haunting. Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) is a single mom with four kids. Janet, the 11 year old, is possessed by the spirit intermediately. As more incidents occur and a media crisis gather, the church calls in the Warrens.At its core, this is a simple haunted house horror. There are a few good horror moves but by itself, it's not that special. The Warrens make it special. They have create a compelling horror universe. Lorraine and the nun have a great nightmare scene. The best is Lorraine having a heart to heart with Janet. They make all the difference."
" Unintentionally the funniest horror film of 2016
",-0.0258,0.9298,2017-08-18 00:00:00,1,"I was watching this film at the theatres and all I could do was laugh at it. This film follows every Cliché that plagues horror films in the modern age. If this film was self-aware it would be as good as Black Dynamite but, it unironically follows every beat the typical horror film these days follow (starting with the phrase 'based on real events' like that makes a film scary). The cinematography is uninspired. The soundtrack is average at best. The special effects are pretty bad. The acting ranges from standard to terrible. Overall this film is great for a good laugh but, anything else will result in a terrible experience.1/10 I would not recommend this film for anyone (except for laughs)"

First one was considered R rated for scares alone, and there was not one scary part in it. Like a TV-14 movie from TV got put on the big screen.As for the first paragraph about this one, is the same. No difference on rating. Must of been a teenager hired to preview the movie before released to get the rating for it. Now, they rated R, but really should be TV-14 rating.People actually got scared off these two movies? Annabelle was spin off the first and was not even scary, and had more gore than both of these two together and did not get scary. What is wrong with directors and producers now a days?Both Sinister movies was hell of a lot better than all Annabelle's and The Conjuring movies. They are not making any more sequels to the Sinister movies. That is a shame. I rather see many, many more sequels of Sinister movies, than this crap.These two movies put shame to the R ratings. Blasphemy is what this is. No recommendation as for horror movies to watch."

Boy, is this nun the scariest villain i may have ever seen. This character alone, deserves it's own film. And sadly, doesn't get much screen time. However, that might be what makes the character so great. All in all, prepare yourself. And you better have those lights on. And preferably, be watching it with someone else.

" A great horror flick to watch on a Friday night
",0.1027,0.9966,2017-08-05 00:00:00,9,"The Conjuring 2 shows us the case of a family who is being haunted by the spirit of a man who used to live in their house when he was alive. He speaks and acts through Janet, one of the kids that live in the house and everything starts to go down for the family.First of all, this movie isn't related to the first one so you can watch it even when you haven't seen the first Conjuring movie.This is one of those stories we've heard and seen a million times before but the director James Wan presents it in such a fresh way that doesn't look full of clichés even when it has a few, like every other horror movie out there. The acting by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga is great as it is expected, but the performance that really stands out, at least in my opinion, is the one from Madison Wolfe, who plays Janet, the 11 years old girl. She gives such a believable performance that I think is great and I would like to see what she does in the future.As the story goes on, the movie becomes even creepier with every scene. There aren't as many jump-scares as you would expect from an ordinary horror movie and the ones that are there are completely justified and they have a reason to be there, and this is something that James Wan always makes a good job like in his other movies like The Conjuring and the first two Insidious movies. I think the cinematography is great, I like the atmosphere they created inside the house even when it's daytime.So, should you watch it? Of course! It is one of the best horror movies of the last decade. It has great acting, a great atmosphere and you will definitely have a good time, especially if you watch it with your friends or your partner."
" Ludicrous Nonsense
",-0.6369,0.9677,2017-08-04 00:00:00,2,"I should have known going into this that I would not be able to enjoy this movie. Although I like James Wan quite a bit, the subject matter of these movies is just not something I can get over. They would have a done a better job if they didn't pretend that this movie was really based on a true story.The biggest problem with this movie is the depiction of Ed and Lorraine Warren as heroic figures. In reality, they are grimy charlatans who make up stories and exploit peoples' wanting to believe in the supernatural to make money. They have been exposed repeatedly as frauds. However, this movie tries to make them heroes. It's impossible for me to see them this way and this made any chance I could like this movie just go out the window.Also, there are plenty of recent horror movies based off of supposed real stories. Most of them do a better job of at least not being so outlandish that no one with sense could possibly believe it. So, let's pretend for an instant that this movie just was admittedly a fiction movie. Let's pretend for a moment that the heroes weren't a couple of slime bag con artists. Let's pretend they presented this film as it was. Would it have been enjoyable? Possibly. Will I ever know? Not really.Even so, it would not have been scary. But the main point is that if I can not root for the hero, I can not like a movie. And the last think the Warrens are or ever have been are heroes. Avoid it."
" James Wan surprisingly avoids sophomore slump on 'Conjuring 2'
",0.128,0.4806,2017-07-16 00:00:00,7,"There are few horror films that have exceeded expectations in the past 20 years. In fact, you can probably count them on two hands. Most people would put 2013's simple-yet-striking spookfest 'The Conjuring' in this list, so it's hard to imagine any follow-up effort coming close to it in terms of quality.Director James Wan clearly realized how important it was to live up to expectations, so he brought his A-game on 2016's 'The Conjuring 2,' which follows world-famous demonologists Ed and Lorraine as they investigate a media circus of a case of a haunted house in Enfield, England. While there's much criticism about the veracity of the story, and the level to which the Warrens were involved in the case, this doesn't change the quality of the film.In 'Conjuring,' we once again get to see Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (both of whom are modern-day scream kings/queens by this point) reprise their roles, and while there are a few other key actors who are key here, particularly Madison Wolfe as the young Janet Hodgson and Frances O'Connor as her mother, Peggy), it's really the ""Patrick and Vera show"" once again. They both deliver strong performances and are the best part about the film. That said, as you would expect, the thrills and chills sent up audiences' spines are also key, and somehow the ones dished out in this film are on the same level as those in its predecessor. Sure, there are a lot of commonly used techniques like shaky cam, quick transitions, etc., but they are done so well here and do not feel cheap at all.Additionally, the soundtrack and sound effects really bring 'Conjuring' to life, as any haunted house movie would rely on. But the main reason this film lives up to expectations is because it has a strong script. From some lighter moments to many tense ones where there are life-and-death situations, it really is all in the script and the screenplay.'The Conjuring 2' proves that breakout horror films are not always a fluke - it's possible to build a successful franchise that resonates with audiences."
" An Almost Perfect Sequel and Horror Movie in General
",-0.0754,-0.6901,2017-07-15 00:00:00,9,"I was incredibly impressed by the way this movie kept the same general theme, vibe, and strength of scares as its predecessor, while also being fresh and adding just the right changes to subvert expectations. I also loved how they actually called the police this time, and based on the common sense theory that some sinister prankster was behind everything. Although the mother really should have thought about that. But whatever, at least someone acted rationally, which is incredibly rare in horror films. I was then impressed again by the fact that paranormal events happened while the police were there. Words can't describe how satisfying and refreshing that was to see.The only thing that really bothered me about this movie, was the part where everyone suddenly concluding that all the hauntings were fake, due to one incident. In what universe would a rational thinking adult believe that a little girl could fake everything that happened? That scene was so frustrating.However, the aforementioned weakness was connected to a strength in this film. I loved that Loraine wasn't able to see the demon. That is something I didn't expect. The way they found out later why she couldn't see the demon, was also a very exiting addition to the story.The ending of this film is a big improvement over The Conjuring. Mainly in the sense that the final battle with the demon was shorter. These final battles, where the demon fully possesses someone, aren't as scary for me. Demon's are more scary to me when they aren't in a physical form, because things that I can't see scare me the most. At the point of possession, I don't see a demon, just a crazy acting human that my brain associates with someone with a mental health problem."
" A bit long but better than the first
",0.5927,-0.1406,2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed the first conjuring movie well enough but I wasn't dying to see the follow-up. It's a surprisingly good sequel that impressed me more than the first one.There is a simple enough setup of Loraine and Warren once again going to investigate a haunted house. I think what I like the most about how James Wan starts horror movies is that he really sets the mood. By showing the characters reacting to spirits or scary things going on then we start to get a sense of the state of mind that they get put in.I love how this movie is shot. With the prevalence of shaky cam and found footage horror movies it's almost refreshing to see long crane cam shots and just an overall clarity how everything is presented. Many horror and suspense movies lean on having cameras wobbling around to create confusion and try and feel scary. His horror movies feel more like he's trying to pull you and make you feel what the characters are feeling.My one big complaint is the running time. When a movie is asking for more than 2 hours of my attention it better have no pacing issues. The pacing does dip a bit in the 3rd act but the final 30 minutes mostly make up for it.I hope James Wan makes at least one more of these after Aquaman because these movies are a lot of fun in a way most directors can't come close.
" Very scary
",-0.5413,0.8275,2017-06-24 00:00:00,10,This is one of the scarier movies I have seen. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. This is scarier then The Exorcist and is not easy to do. This is one of the scariest movies of all time. You may to want to watch this movie alone. It is a very scary movie. It so scary. It will scary you. If this movie does not scary you no movie will. Patrick Wilson is a great actor. James Wan is a great film maker. This a very scary movie. If you like horror movies you will like this movie. It make jump. 7.4 is good ratting. But is such a good movie that 7.4 is underrating it. This a 10 out of 10.
" Not worth your time
",-0.1695,-0.4544,2017-06-14 00:00:00,2,"Sure, there is some truth to the story, in the sense that two girls made up a story of possession (which has been thoroughly debunked) and that Maurice Grosse was there as a paranormal investigator. With him was Guy Playfair (not depicted in this movie) while the Warrens were hardly involved at all. A far better, and more frightening dramatization of these events is the British mini-series The Enfield Haunting, although that, like this, does conclude that the haunting was real. Great cast, inspired by an interesting story, but frankly, the movie turned out quite boring and not particularly frightening."
" Review - The Conjuring 2 (2016)
",0.0,0.9884,2017-06-06 00:00:00,5,"For someone who loved the old-school horror vibe of The Conjuring, the sequel is barely memorable. It's not about the performances. It's not about the grim atmosphere. It's not about the cinematography, editing or direction. It's just that, after a pretty decent start, it loses steam big time towards the middle, and the viewer is left with little to care, when things start to make more sense towards the end. The way in which this whole saga transpired is what disappointed me, as a viewer.The first instalment definitely towers over the sequel in almost every way. Much to the dismay of the viewer, the storyline itself seems like a toned-down rehash of their Rhode Island adventure from the first film. This time, the setting is Enfield, North London. Peggy Hodgson, a single mother of four seems to be experiencing the paranormal and the Warrens are called in to help. Lorraine seems to be undergoing some sort of psychological turmoil, after the couple had dealt with the Amityville Haunting (the scenes of which are shown in the initial part of the movie). She seems to have this recurring vision of a Demon Nun haunting her and trying to harm her husband.Much like the sequels in another series by James Wan, Insidious, this one too starts on a promising note. The first seance is well- executed and brings goosebumps for old-school horror junkies. The Demon Nun seemed good for a terrifyingly scary villain. Later, the scene shifts to England where we are introduced to the Hodgsons and a few scenes in the night involving the kids mostly waking to loud thuds, frightening noises, and toys moving by themselves. The jump- scares are decent, but they lack innovation. They are very straight- forward, in the sense, the viewer is able to predict exactly when they are going to happen.A few fright-nights later, one of the kids, Janet, shows signs that she is possessed by a spirit of an old man who used to own the house they live in, and finally the Warrens stop by. The scares are surprisingly low in the mid-portions and this is where the film falters in engrossing the viewer. The old man's spirit is somewhat akin to the Freddy Krueger character. His presence might pose as a viable threat for a scene or two, but definitely not for a stretch lasting more than 45 minutes. Plus, more than just ghastly makeup effects, James Wan chooses to take the mechanical route and wants the viewer to ingest the paranormal existence the same way the kids in the film do. Unfortunately, that R-rating will make sure only adults see the film and I'm pretty confident when I say that many of us will find this mid-segment (or let's say the connecting piece), downright dull.The scenes involving the Demon Nun are highly intriguing as well as disconcerting, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed these bits. Much like the Lipstick-Face Demon from Insidious (2010), the Demon Nun possesses that X-factor fit for a daunting antagonist persona, gelling with the mood of the film perfectly. I was hoping to catch more petrifying scenes that showcased the Demon Nun's presence but sadly, the entity disappears midway only to show up at the climax (as a supposed big twist, meh!). James Wan and his cinematographer Don Burgess try their best to juggle perspectives and angles inside the minimalist haunted-house setup. Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) continue to appear an endearing couple plagued by the paranormal and their on-screen chemistry is splendidly portrayed. However, they could have benefited from a more revised screenplay that consistently maintained an unsettling vibe. The twins Chad & Carey Hayes, and James Wan himself contributed to the screenplay, apart from a later rewrite from David Leslie Johnson.To put it bluntly, there is not a single scene in this film that sends chills down our spine such as the 'hide-and-seek-clap' sequence from the first film. A possessed Lili Taylor was much more intimidating than a possessed Madison Wolfe. The Perrons from Rhode Island warranted more attention than the Hodgsons from Enfield. Who knows, the Crooked Man toy may get even its own film, similar to Annabelle. For now, I am just gonna cling on to the first film and sincerely hope James Wan scores a winner the next time around."
" It said it wants to hurt you
",-0.5267,-0.8587,2017-05-30 00:00:00,10,It is so good that they actually started making scary movies the way they used to be. SCARY! The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 will keep you at the edge of your seat. Or maybe behind it. This is not one of those so called scary movies that things jump out at you for that quick jump. No No in this movie you will see it coming. You will see it and it will scare the pants right off you. No cheap screams here. More like whimpering in the corner hoping for a nice ending. Will you get it? I guess you have to watch it to find out.
" Get out of my house part 2!!!!
",0.0,0.9556,2017-05-25 00:00:00,6,"The year is 1977 and paranormal investigators Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson)travel across the Atlantic to Enfield, London to help a single mother of four children Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor)who believes that there is a presence in her home. Things take a turn for the worst when one of Peggy's daughters Janet (Madison Wolfe) becomes the focus of the entity's attention....In many ways this sequel was quite brave as I could see that James Wan could have potentially set himself up for a fall - this film is essentially an English version of The Amityville horror and I could imagine that some people may complain about it being a rip-off of The Amityville Horror(although in fairness to Wan he does make no pretences that the film is anything else given the fact that The Amityville Horror is referenced in the early stages of the film and like The Amityville Horror the events that happened in London are purportedly based on true events as well).Despite the familiar central premise, The Conjuring 2 still has a lot of strong and nice touches about it. Like the first film, Wan builds up the suspense admirably and again moves the camera around well; the score is good and is also used well and at the appropriate times. Wan has also done an excellent job in recreating 1970's Britain which gives the film an appropriate sense of time and period.Like the first film, this sequel has its fair share of creepy and shocking moments and many of these sequences are carried off with a degree of skill and professionalism. Unfortunately, there are odd 'scary' moments in the film that didn't work for me whereby they looked more silly than scary, but there were more moments where the scares worked so this isn't a major criticism.The acting is pretty good too with both Farmiga and Wilson being on good form. Frances O'Connor is also endearing as the struggling single parent. However, the real star of the show was young Madison Wolfe who stole the show from her adult co-stars.Even though this is basically a reinterpretation of The Amityville Horror it still has enough of James Wan's style about it to make it an enjoyable experience. It does have much of the feel of the first film about it which does make some of what you see here a tad more predictable, but the chances are that if you liked the first film then you should still enjoy this one too."
" It's the best horror movie of 2016
",0.128,-0.9366,2017-05-14 00:00:00,7,"Conjuring 2 was arguably the most interesting horror film that came out last year. Recently, most horror films have been using all kinds of special effects that didn't fit the genre of horror film due to its outlandish way of portraying supernatural entities (ghosts, monsters etc.) which ultimately hinders the scary factor of the genre. Compared to another horror sequel which I have watched called Sinister 2 and various other horror films released within a year with Conjuring 2, I can say that the movie has done well in delivering the right atmosphere for its genre. I watched this movie as a group in a film club for our school and I'd like to say that we were pretty scared. Some Korean students have expressed that Western horror films are exceptionally different from East Asian horror films. They are more focused towards Christianity and religious storyline while the East Asian horror films are heavily reliant on revenge/vengeance type of plot development. All in all, Conjuring 2 was a decent horror film compared to a recent surge of terribly made horror films, but they certainly have areas that they can improve on."
" Just as good as the first installment
",0.4404,0.8378,2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"This film is just scary as hell. This one also focuses on the love between the two leads. The nun is creepy. I know creepy nuns have been done before, but this one uses it so well. I also found myself yelling at Patrick Wilson's character at the end of the film. Listen to your wife you fool! Silly I know but that is a testament to how invested I was in the story and its characters. I highly recommend this movie. Especially to those who loved the first movie."
" A great sequel.
",0.6249,0.696,2017-05-07 00:00:00,8,"Given sequels aren't the easiest of movies to pull of in the world of horror I think this did exceptionally well. The movie follows its roots without relying on them to tell an entirely new story, and one that has yet again a great atmosphere and serious coolness.Try not be lured into comparison with the first movie and any fans of The Conjuring will enjoy this well directed creepy sequel."
" Just as Bone-Chilling as the First One
",0.0,0.9843,2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Usually sequels never live up to the original film, but this film stands out. I thought the Conjuring 2 was just as scary as the first movie and I'm so happy they made it. Although many will miss the setting of the farmhouse, the house in England is turned into a house of horrors that lives up to the original. Based off of the true story of the Enfield Haunting, a family is terrorized by a demon that's set on possessing the daughter. I'm so happy that Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson returned as the Warrens, their acting is breathtaking and I would love to see more of them in the future. I loved that they added the Amityville Haunting in the beginning of the film (which they also investigated in real life) and played off of the end of the first film. Another thing I really loved about the movie, is the other side characters shown in the film, like The Crooked Man and The Nun. They are already making a spin off about The Nun right now and I can't wait to see what it has in store for us. Bottom line is The Conjuring 2 will scare you just as much as the first one and it definitely should be in your Top 10 Scariest Films."
" An Honest Review

And even then few have actually provided the constant nightmares of The Exorcist...But The Conjuring 2 feels like it's going for the PG scares to not lose audiences.The potential is there, but the director is flying with one hand on the chicken switch and pulls out of everything that's not worse than a jump-scare.We have the potential for an actual psychologically thrilling horror story here, but its a wasted potential.Ultimately, like every other horror movie made of late, it seems afraid to actually frighten people.Still, it's better than the torture porn on the market"
" The conjuring : a Series
",0.0,0.4563,2017-04-12 00:00:00,6,"James Wan continues the series that gripped America and made us sleep with the lights on, with an admirable follow up to the first Conjruing film. The first half of the movie had terrifying scenes that build tension and dread that really stick with the viewer. Wan uses camera angles that are incredibly effective that magnify the scares. While the movie was effectively scary, it did not match the flair of the first film. The first film, built the tension much more effectively, and the sense of dread was more prevalent. Again this film was creepy, it really was, it just didn't have those moments that stuck with me like the first film did, and that is the challenge with sequels overall in trying to outdo the first film. I will say the young actress who was targeted by the presence in the film was absolutely fantastic and stole the scenes. Again good movie, with good scares, just not on the level of the first film."
" Comparison with The Conjuring

I am just comparing the story of The Conjuring part 1 with the part 2. The part 1 had a more attractive story with father, mother and children's all were part. In part 2 we didn't had the father and smaller sons comes to picture just when he goes to the kitchen during a seen towards the end.Also the use of heat sensitive cameras and other techniques used in part 1 were really making the scenes true and believable. Which was missing from some scenes in part 2.But the horror, had played its part. I was wondering for some more scenes of the stutterer boy when he couldn't find words to express his fears. Overall the movie is amazing and should be watched alone only."
" Solid if overall rather decent haunting effort
",-0.128,0.9155,2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Attempting to move on in their careers, the famous couple is brought to a case in England involving a single mother who believes that her home is possessed only to find that it's targeted their teenage daughter and must try to stop the demonic entity from haunting them.Overall this one wasn't all that bad of a sequel effort. When this one works, it's due to the usual round of high-intensity supernatural action set-pieces that are quite prominent in this style. Those early hauntings, from the first instances of the demonic happenings in the bedroom where it appears out of the shadows of their toys to scare him or the later scene of it throwing the bookshelf against the door in front of everyone, are genuinely creepy moments that work rather well here, and along with the special series of stalking scenes later on that really makes a much more prominent atmosphere that lets the scares come rather nicely. The scenes of the possessed daughter throwing around the furniture in the house, appearing as the demonic spirits to torment the family or the different sessions attempting to exorcise the spirit in front of the different sets of experts that are there to help them all give this one some rather intense and chilling encounters. Other big scenes, from the spirits' attack in the bedroom where it traps her in the locked room and begins wrapping her in the sheets as well as the big showcase freak-out in front of the research team where it appears to be all faked for their perspective that leads into the utterly thrilling finale as they finally attempt to wrest her from its control makes it all quite fun as there's a lot of chilling suspense in the ghostly figures appearing around the house, the action of needing to rescue her up in the bedroom and the attempt to confront the demon once and for all ends this one with a ton of fun and a great overall feel. Given that this one keeps the interest up once it gets to these scenes featuring plenty of continuous action to keep it going, there's plenty to like here even with a few minor flaws here. The biggest issue here is the rather cliché and unimpressive ghostly attacks which are found in the first half which is mainly a part of the demon nun attacking her in their house as these are typical and expected scares. Playing with shadows, close- ups of roaring demonic faces out of nowhere and intense scenes that prove to be dream sequences all show up throughout here, and they all drop off rather quickly than the films' later demonic scares. They're a part of the film's other problem in the exaggerated length that really didn't need to be, as the first half here is way too long in getting them over to the house so it feels a little lopsided in terms of action here. These do hold it back although it's not enough to really be a detriment.Rated R: Violence, Language, children-in-jeopardy and underage smoking."
" Not Bad as Far as Horrors Go!
",-0.2828,-0.8415,2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"*May Contain Spoilers*Over the years we've been victim to the regurgitation of horror classics as well as sequel after sequel (to be fair, this is an aspect that has always existed within the horror genre) and to be honest, I haven't seen a horror for a long time that has made me feel even slightly creeped out, never mind scared! That being said, The Conjuring 2 certainly starts off well with some very chilling moments and plenty of tension building. Luckily it doesn't fall into the trap of relying solely on jump scares which have recently become the norm. I did find myself during the occasional scene actually holding my breath in anticipation to see what would happen. The issue arises later in the film where we get a very boring ending and a whole ""prophecy"" aspect that is ignored (perhaps it will be addressed in a later film). Not to mention that the ending had a somewhat rushed feel to it that deviated from the earlier pace of the film. So I've given this film a 7, not because I think out of any film would would deserve a 7/10 but because taking the last decade or two of horrors I think it certainly did a better job than most. So my 7/10 is solely as a comparison to other horrors rather than a representation of earlier films."

""The Conjuring 2"" comes across as a clone of ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"" and ""Poltergeist"". As to the issue of the whole story's accuracy, I'm not interested in that. I'd prefer it if horror movies emphasized the unknown over cheap surprises, as ""The Shining"" did. James Wan has directed better movies than this (Saw, Dead Silence), while Vera Farmiga (The Departed) and Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) have starred in better. I don't recommend the movie.So part of the investigation took place on Christmas in 1977. I guess that they heard on the news that Charlie Chaplin died that day."
" A good sequel! Highly recommended!
",0.6785,-0.9069,2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"Wow!! Just wow!! James Wan is fast becoming by top horror director of all time. So far the Insidious franchise has put my faith back in actual scary horror movies and not the awful horror violence movies such as Rob Zombies god awful Halloween 2 where there is nothing scary whatsoever seeing someone stabbed 13 times. But with Dead Silence, Insidious and now The Conjuring, James Wan has made and produced some classic horrors. With the first Conjuring, I thought it was excellent up to the kind of rip-off ending where it reminded me far too much of The Exorcist. That was my only gripe with the film though.In The Conjuring 2 however, yes we have another possession but it is the three 'demons' that Wan has added to this movie which just terrifies you. It was bad enough having nightmares about Red Faced Demon and The Bride in Black from Insidious. Now we have Bill Wilkins (The Old Man), The Nun and The Crooked Man. All three of these played on my fears that I had as a kid and they were truly terrifying. Like with Annabelle who was introduced in The Conjuring and got her own spin off film, the same will now happen with The Nun in this film and I for one can't wait. A special mention must go to the production design as well because the house that the family live in in this movie would be terrifying WITHOUT all the haunting's going on!! Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren are even better in this than the first one and are a great on screen couple with quite a nice scene at the end dancing to an Elvis Presley track."

" Solid sequel to the terrifying original
",-0.2023,-0.852,2017-02-24 00:00:00,7,"The original 'The Conjuring' was one of the best horror movies I had seen in a long time, a genuinely frightening and refreshingly unpredictable horror film that made for a welcome addition to the genre. I was just hoping that 'The Conjuring 2' didn't make the same mistakes as 'Sinister 2', which was a total disaster.Thankfully, the hugely talented horror director James Wan ensured that didn't happen and produced a very commendable Conjuring sequel. Whilst 'The Conjuring 2' doesn't quite reach the same heights as the original, it's still a very solid horror with plenty of scares. As in the first movie, the tension builds nicely until the final quarter, when the pace is relentless.I was impressed after originally fearing the worst for this sequel. 'The Conjuring 2' is a respectable horror movie, but the original is the more frightening and unpredictable of the two."

No seriously -> ?), a movie I probably could do without, this sequel is something that touches upon the themes of the original and with the same cast actually delivers on its promise.Apparently the filmmakers take real life incidents (things that actually happened to some degree) and build a movie around it. And it does work, because you do have a stellar pair who really have a great chemistry. It's not bloody horror, but it is horror that is able to have you at the edge of your seat"
" Hell on Parade
",-0.6808,-0.8435,2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"For years, I've been telling people that the scariest horror movie I've ever seen is 'The Exorcist.' Well, all that changed after watching 'The Conjuring 2.' All I can say is, Wow! James Wan, who I've been following since his 2004 feature 'Saw,' has shown amazing growth as a purveyor of the demonic. And his understanding of the intrinsic nature of evil from a Catholic perspective rivals that of William Peter Blatty, who I have greatly admired since reading his novel THE EXORCIST, upon which the movie was based.Now, I enjoyed 'The Conjuring' which, like the sequel, is based on a paranormal case by real-life investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. After seeing that movie, I began researching the Warrens and learned about the case in England, where the story of 'The Conjuring 2' takes place. The fact that these are actual cases and involve demonic possession both intrigues and horrifies me. As a Catholic, I believe in Hell. And I believe that demons like the one featured in 'The Conjuring 2' have walked the earth long before man. Perhaps this is why, for me, the film is so frightening.Flipping around the dial the other day, I happened across the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' reboot from 2010. Though well made, it wasn't scary. I know Freddie Kreuger is a fantasy character and, despite the sharpness of his homemade claws, he's just another homicidal killer. And I feel that way about most horror movies involving monsters. 'The Babadook' is a great example. Yes, he's paper-thin and creepy. But that's about it. I was more moved by the exasperated, sleep-deprived Amelia and her lonely, desperate attempts at creating a normal life for her troubled son, Samuel. Conversely, when the demon in 'The Conjuring 2' takes on the form of The Crooked Man, I ended up halfway out of my seat—which is a tribute to the genius of James Wan.Like most folks, I believe horror movies do well because people like to be scared. It's a rush similar to riding a roller coaster. And when it's over, you're relieved. But every once in a while a film comes along that disturbs the viewer to the core, its aftereffect lingering for days. 'The Conjuring 2' is just such a movie. And an estimated $40M in box office receipts at the time of this writing—this kind of story sells.Now, I'm not saying that a film like this will turn an atheist into a believer. But it might make those who are on the fence about God, angels and demons think twice before picking up the planchette from that Ouija board collecting dust in the corner with those other games. My advice—just say no."
" Best sequel for a supernatural movie
",0.6369,0.9264,2017-02-12 00:00:00,8,The first conjuring really was good and creepy. First it was Annabelle and now it's The Nun in this one really took the cake in this sequel. The next story about Ed and Laurianne warren where they are headed to London to help a struggling family with the ghost who wants a young girl does seem a lot like The Exorcist but the movie has brilliantly time scares and knows how to keep anyone interested. When the conjuring two starts it will begin with a good scare and will keep on delivering unpredictable moments of jumps and scares until the very last minute of the movie with what is definitely the most creepiest part and ironic part of the movie and let's hope that these movies will keep on being made because this will be a franchise that will never stop being successful and popular

I love her in Bates Motel as well. I believe I liked this better than the first one. The first one was so great but I just didn't care for the other characters in the story, but this one I do. I feel so bad for the little girl and the family and I want the Warrens to help her and her family. The whole family is great and you really feel for them. This is such a creepy and scary movie and the special effects in this movie are so great! I will always love the Conjuring movies and after seeing this I do consider them some of my favorite scary movies. The one thing I absolutely love about this movie is that Faith plays a big part in the movie. I am a Christian and it is so refreshing to see a scary movie that has faith as one of the main parts in the movie when so many scary movies don't. I love that faith plays a big role in Ed and Lorraine Warren's marriage and family. This stuff is real and I love that this story is based on real events. It shows that God is real and Satan is real as well."
" We want love in horror genre!..

Everything is so fast that in a couple of years a good number of practices and ways will be altered with speed for the sake of non-persistent productions. And the horror genre, in the field of cinema, has been exposed to this tendency the most.On the other hand, this movie tries to whip off the horror genre. Not because of its strong originality, but because of its devoutness in cinematography, screenplay, and acting.Not only the lead actors are of the best quality, especially Ms. Vera Farmiga, but the rest of the actors helped it seem like the story actually ""was"" taking place when we see it.The scenes were prepared carefully along with the unvarnished, austere movements and shots of the camera.The screenplay was originally derived from a true story, yeah. But it is not the sole reason behind the success. In fact, the writers changed it a lot to the point that it had cooperativeness, helpfulness and love that was missing from the original story at the time of which the people and the media treated the Hodgson family as zoo animals.Okay. Time for truth... Every horror fan knows that a good horror movie should scare us really well and be of originality doing it. But if we look at randomly selected 100 movies, we were to see that most of them chooses a way that contains emetic amount of blood, stupid decisions, musical pieces that were composed rather by chance, the showing up of the killer out of thin air irrationally when you least expect it, the appearance of the killer / the monster after the character(s) cuts in the frame and thereafter steps aside, etc... We could really go on...But this one kept as far away from these commonplaces as possible. Of course it is not a huge success for that matter. But their centering the story not around the horror but around love is the real achievement of this movie.For I would not find anyone that won't notice the love between the lead characters and their compassion towards people (in need). That is what the world needs. Yep!I will give this movie a ""8,2"". Yes. Love.Hey Mr. Patrick Wilson! Hey Ms. Vera Farmiga!.. Great to see you perform!.. :-)""It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West (during prayer.); but righteous is he who believes in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Scripture and the prophets; and gives wealth, for love of Him, to kinsfolk and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask, and to set slaves free; and observes proper worship and pays the poor-due. And they who fulfill their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant, and endure with fortitude misfortune, hardship and peril, these are they who are true in their faith, these are the Allah-fearing.""The Gracious Koran speaks on matters in its 2nd Chapter called ""The Cow""; the 177th Verse.

" An Odd Case of well-made Hollywood Horror
",-0.7184,0.6858,2017-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Attempts to make horror franchises usually flop in terms of quality. Sequels of classic or modern greats such as Halloween and Paranormal Activity, despite being financially successful, fail to critically impress, unlike their predecessors. This might be because they are retreading the same solidified steps, or that the director had changed from the first. And although director James Wan made a lacklustre attempt at his Insidious sequel, he recaptured the spirit of The Conjuring with its sequel, The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case. The Conjuring 2 follows paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) yet again as they set out to help another family plagued by malevolent spirits. This time, the factually based haunting is set in the titular London Borough of Enfield, England. 70's London adds a layer of splendour to the film. Everything from that era is nailed - from the fashion to the old-styled accents. What is also faithful is the case itself and the people involved. Actors were specifically hired to look like their real life counterparts and most of the events from the case are virtually re-enacted from witness descriptions. Even the haunted house and its properties look the same, which makes for a lot of believability for those who are familiar with the story. By focusing on a case outside the US, the film differentiates itself from the first straight away. However, as is the curse of the horror sequel as previously mentioned, the film retreads many stylistic titbits of Wan's earlier works. One example of this is when a demon points ominously to the desired victim - the same motif used in Insidious. The Conjuring 2's antagonist also looks strikingly similar to 'The Bride in Black' in Insidious, but other than that, Wan uses his one-of-a-kind horror filmmaking skill to craft something that stands out in his filmography.The tension in the second outing is on par with the original. Wan uses audiences' expectation and paranoia to carefully execute effective scares. There are moments that build to nothing, in the beginning, playing on fears of the dark and of unusual sounds with fantastic lighting. As the events occur, they become increasingly more violent and scarier. Sometimes, though, the film becomes zany and not as believable as the first. Wan once stated that he prefers to leave things to the audience's imagination, but more is revealed in this film. I also have a problem with the amount of CGI as practical effects look more believable.Wan's experience with The Fast & Furious franchise carries its silver linings here in the form of more energetic cinematography (solidly taken care of by Don Burgess). Camera movements are superb and invigorating, with the tracking shots being a highlight throughout the director's career. He includes them better than ever before, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats as we follow our protagonists through to whatever lies ahead. Joseph Bishara once again helms the score - the scariest aspect of his films. Percussions, strings, and haunting choirs are used to punctuate The Conjuring 2's disturbing imagery to maximum shock and discomfort. I do not know if I would be scared at all if this unbearably frightening score was not included.Farmiga is the star of the show here and Wilson holds his own too. I am glad the Warrens continue to develop, as they are becoming even more empathetic and compelling this time around. Most importantly, they actually seem quite vulnerable. In the finale, you feel like anything could happen to these characters, which I personally found exciting. While The Conjuring 2 cannot compete with its predecessor's subtlety and innovation, it serves as the cherry on top to James Wan's title: this generation's most consistent horror director. See it for some of the best thrills of the year"
" A fine follow up
",0.2023,0.901,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,I really enjoyed the first one so I was a bit reluctant after reading some of the negative reviews on this site I think the characters in the first one were a bit more likable other than that this one was every bit as good I can only assume that the negative reviews people who are nothing short of ignorant If you saw the first one you def need to see this one You wont be disappointed I've heard rumors of a 3rd one so hopefully that happens The only thing that I was disappointed at (and it's minor)was that Lorraine had to come up with a name (I wont say name of what or its a spoiler) and I've heard that name quite a few other times in different movies All in all though a fine movie and am glad I finally had a chance to watch it
" Quantity over quality
",0.0,-0.8893,2017-01-25 00:00:00,4,"""The Conjuring 2"" is the sequel to ""The Conjuring"", a pretty successful horror film from 2013. The director and one of the many writers here is once again James Wan, a Malaysian filmmaker who truly made it big in Hollywood. But the title of my review also refers to him and his career a bit. He worked on ""Saw, ""Insidious"", ""Conjuring"" and more horror films, so he is certainly one of the defining directors of the genre right now. But it seems as if he has sacrificed a great deal of creativity in case he ever had it. I personally was not a great fan of the first Conjuring movie and I am also not too big on this one here. The film itself is also where the title of my review applies. It is basically a summation of all kinds of elements used in all kinds of horror films in the past. Unseen danger. Very visible danger. Exorcist elements. Danger in the water. Children and women who get scared the hell out of them. Tough-ass male characters who want to fight the dark spirits at any cost etc.The two protagonists are played by Farmiga and Wilson just like in the first film and this is basically another chapter to their profession. However, with Farmiga's character's reaction on some occasions, I truly wonder why she would work in a field like this and not do a quiet office job or so. Also the couple not only runs into scary nuns and dead senior characters that take control of little girls, but they also have to deal with people who criticize their profession and say it's all nonsense, which also does not make any sense overall. So yeah, this film is really packed, but sadly it's like a 100 puzzle parts and almost none of them fit together or result in a convincing overall outcome. In one scene, Farmiga's character is scared to death, in the next it seems like nothing could scare her at all. How is that even possibly. The weakest moment was maybe the (seemingly) self-sacrifice scene of the male protagonist towards the end, which was pretty cringeworthy honestly. I see almost no really creative element in this film here, which sucks a lot and hurts the viewing experience too. This is especially painful as this movie runs for a massive 2 hours and 15 minutes almost, extremely long and you could actually see it as a mini-series in 3 parts of 45 minutes if you wanted. If you add the first movie, you almost have a real mini-series in terms of the length of both films taken together and if they ever make a third film, which they probably will looking at the success of the first two and how Wan loves sequels, then more will be added. As for me, this second film was already one too many, maybe even the first. The performances are also all very generic and bring nothing great to the screen, just like the script. Don't watch."
" I slept with the lights on after 'The Conjuring 2'!
",0.0,-0.9005,2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"It seems like a ton of horror movies come out every year, and most times, they don't live up to their potential. There are a handful of horror movies over the last decade that really satisfy us horror fans. Films like 'The Babadook', 'It Follows', and 'The Conjuring' will still be talked about for years to come. One name in the horror genre, or at least in recent years is James Wan. This man burst onto the scene with 'Saw', which was basically genre changing and spawned a ton of sequels. Wan also made a few other horror films, all testing the bounds and pushing us into a new horror direction, while still respecting his influences.I can easily say that James Wan's name belongs up there with the likes of John Carpenter and Stephen King. The guy knows horror and how to execute it so well that his images will continue to haunt for many years to come. I'm glad he signed on to take on the Ed and Lorraine Warren investigations some years ago and gave us 'The Conjuring' and now 'The Conjuring 2', which was previously titled 'The Enfield Poltergeist'. If you're unfamiliar with Ed and Lorraine Warren, these are two real-life people who were paranormal investigators and professors, who helped a lot of people from hauntings and possessions.Perhaps their most famous investigation was 'The Amityville Horror', which is where 'The Conjuring 2' starts out, as Ed and Lorraine Warren are investigating the house a few months after the Lutz family moved out. It's here that Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) has a vision of something so sinister, that she makes her husband Ed (Patrick Wilson) promise that they are done with these investigations. That's when things start to go awry over in England at the Hodgson residence where things go bump in the night and then some, as the mother Peggy Hodgson and her four young kids are subjected to moving furniture, screams, and much more.Ed and Lorraine hear of this and set out to England to help out, despite their previous promise, and then all hell breaks loose – literally. Running at over two hours, there are certain times where 'The Conjuring 2' seems like its doing too much, but there is nothing bad about the movie really. It's just that we're put through so much suspense, horror, and terror, that by the final act, we are glad it's over with. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes you exhausted by the end. Director James Wan is true modern master of horror. He uses the usual horror genre tropes, but makes them relevant and fresh all over again, whether it be a child hiding under the covers while something is hovering over you, or a possessed toy, and even ghostly visions.Most of these moments will leave a lasting and terrifying impression that will make it difficult to sleep at night, particularly a certain beastly nun. I still get shivers thinking about it. Wan also adds some comedy here, but is used sparingly, and is relegated to the time period. It was a nice breath from all the intense horror that was going on in the film. The score is fantastic and adds to every single moment of terror. It's incredible that these stories are real and that you can actually research them, and Wan does an incredible job of adapting the material and making it entertaining and scary-as-hell. 'The Conjuring 2' is a fantastic sequel and is an instant horror classic.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Hmmm...
",0.0,0.9468,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Although a good movie, the story is an account of ( or ripped from ) a British drama called ""The Einfield Haunting"". This movie was good but did not do justice to the original events. I recommend people watch the original drama. The drama is a mini-series which covers the events quite extensively.The plot is also OK but nothing extra ordinary. In comparison I think the first movie was great. For people who do not care much about the source of the story, this should still be quite watchable. In this day and age where horror seems to be a synonym for gore and filth, you'd find this to be a fresh telling of actual events.Definitely creepy and well worth the watch."
" a really good movie to watch
",0.4927,0.5557,2017-01-17 00:00:00,9,"The Conjuring 2 is a really good horror movie you should as fan must see. All I had in the beginning the feeling it corresponded over with Insidious. it is actually a kind of the same story so it can be right. (I will not give spoilers so you have to see the movie to understand what I mean) The start of the movie begins slowly but at the first time you be on the sofa glued to watch the movie.The music at the main menu sets the tone actually what for movie The conjuring 2 is. Really well done! I found the film very believable. But the only thing i was missing was more information about the head (demon) person in the story because it was more about ""poltergeist"" and the family. (Sorry still a small spoiler) I found the location very suited to the film. Each scene what happened in their Home was creepy, exciting and good.A must if you like Horror and at not have night afraid to sleep;)"
" A True Horror Film
",-0.2263,0.9863,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Finally, a true horror film. No starlets losing their tops running around aimlessly. This had a good plot, great film work, excellent suspense and a few well-deserved jump scares. Although some of the CG seemed low budget, I do believe it was certainly meant to come off that way based on the subject. Wilson and Farmiga create characters that are adaptable and believable. The supporting cast as well were very strong and created a true empathetic connection. It is a rare feat these days to create a creepy movie with strong character performances that do not not rely solely on CG or jump scares. If you are in the mood for a real horror movie, this just might fit your style perfectly. Very enjoyable."
