" Atrocious
",0.0,0.5003,2021-04-04 00:00:00,2,"Doesn't follow the original plot AT ALL. Most of the characters can't be recognised since in the anime it was all mixed race and cultures and in the film it's fully Japanese in this. 0/10 for the acting, 10/10 for the titans tho, they were the best part. Absolutely atrocious."

" Please don't watch this
",0.3182,-0.3612,2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,This movie sucks. Director should probably go home and rethink his life.
" Well... the emptiness after finishing aot continues...
",-0.4404,0.8381,2021-01-19 00:00:00,4,"I am 4 minutes into this film and already offended by Eren wearing the scarf and Mikasa showing no emotional trauma and seems upbeat... (okay flippantly gives it to her because shes ""chilly""... this wimp)Ive returned to this review and can only say... dont watch this after the anime, expecting to feel the void the anime leaves behind... but maybe I could've accepted it for a film to enjoy a bit if it werent for the my one true love... the anime..."
" If u r an Attack on titan Anime fan! Plzz Don't watch this!!!
",-0.453,-0.8504,2020-12-30 00:00:00,1,"So disappointed!! Changed the main story line and has made the story cringy!!! And what the hell was wrong with Mikasa! You guyzzz have just Spoiled our fav anime by making this rubbish movie!!! Being a true Attack On Titan Anime fan, from today onwards i will never watch any of your Director's , producer's , industry's film!!!!! A big Middle finger For you!!!"
" Truly terrible
",-0.0516,-0.9873,2020-12-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie is awful, disgusting, horrific, disturbing and crappy CGI used, the blood could not get any realistic, it just looked like massive chunks of ketchup stuck in it, please don't watch this movie it's a literal nightmare, the characters are inaccurate, a character with golden colored hair in the anime somehow has long black hair in this movie? It did not make sense at all, the Titans where horrifying. Only if iseyama let America do the job of making this movie and CGI then it would have been better. Here is my conclusion: Disgusting to watch, terrible, horrifying, makes no sense, garbage blood effects, plots is really dumb, nightmarish movie. Don't spend your time watching this piece of garbage, once you see it, throw it out in the garbage quickly it's not a good movie."
" Just don't. So bad.
",0.4708,0.282,2020-12-06 00:00:00,4,I knew going in it wouldn't be very good but I was curious to see the visual effects. The story is so compressed and it should have not been attempted for live action in the first place.
" NOT THAT BAD
",0.431,0.9598,2020-12-02 00:00:00,7,"The CGI on the Titans are not that bad but the swinging part are really bad and they didn't put levi in this movie biggest mistake ever.They changed the story so if you a big fan of the anime like me you gonna hate this movie but the story ain't that bad but after all this live anime movie is one the best out there
SO IT'S WORTH A WATCH"
" Bad but could be worse
",-0.7506,-0.6158,2020-09-30 00:00:00,2,"From a non-weeb perspective... some of the cringiest movies i've seen, really forced acting, bad CGIs, confusing and awful.
I know it's supposed to be sci-fi-fantasy but i found it really illogic in general, i was looking forward to enjoy some violent and gory stuff... very disappointed.I'd say it's not worth watching but is up to you :)"
" Just okay.
",0.2263,0.6675,2020-08-08 00:00:00,6,The premise of the movie is very unique and The visuals are fantastic. Now what I didn't care for. The characters acted like idiots throughout the movie and consistently made silly decisions. Now with all that said. The movie is worth a watch.
" Bad. Just plain bad.
",-0.7906,0.9361,2020-08-03 00:00:00,1,"It doesn't even worth the time to write this review but I'm doing it anyway.
I'm a huge fan of the anime and the manga series but this movie has nothing to do with the actual series. I mean yes the same characters but they are not exactly the same characters, they just took the same names and that's all. I mean Eren not having any purposes? Really? It's the only thing Eren does actually, he is the furthest thing from being an aimless teenager. I pity the money, the time and the effort to make this movie but can't cry over spilled milk...
At least you can save your time without watching it."
" How can this great manga become so low rate movie like this
",0.6842,0.7364,2020-06-01 00:00:00,1,"From great plot of manga
how this Director can produce such a low rate movie like this
so non sense on many sceneif he don't know how to make a good movie, he should not accept this job"
" Flawed & Changed Yes, But Still Entertains!!
",0.7926,0.9564,2020-05-08 00:00:00,7,"Shinji Higuchi's 2015 adaptation of the phenomenal hit series Attack On Titan, has received scathing reviews and harsh criticism from fans - and as one of those fans, I can understand why. But my hat is off to the director and his team for brining the incredible tale of humanity versus evil to the cinematic world, albeit with a few flaws and changes throughout. Such changes come in the form of names, characters stories and sub-plots, and exchanging the animes warm coloured tones of reds and browns, for a colder, blue tone. I do like this though, as the blood and explosions look amazing on top of it.The opening 26 minutes of part one alone, offers more action, destruction, horror and violence than most Hollywood films of the same genre do in 90 minutes. And while shot on a fraction of the budget its Western counterparts would have on-hand, Attack On Titan offers a stunningly filmed, entertaining film with high production values, gorgeous art design, detailed sets, great score and more...If you were to watch this version and its sequel, before even going near the anime, you would be blown away. The set design is amazing, backed by some gorgeous visuals and great performances from its cast. Live-action Japanese adaptations of animes come a dime-a-dozen these days, with very few staying faithful to their source material, and often looking very low budget in its look and visual effects. While this adaptation may suffer in the former, it tries hard to win over its audience with better than average CGI in bringing these titan monsters to life!While its no Pacific Rim, the towering titans still do the job, looking incredibly terrifying for the most part as they chase down the villagers, tearing buildings apart, and ripping bodies apart with their teeth - as the blood spurts and flies through the air, hitting whoever is in its way. It's actually quite violent and not shy on gore - with an insane end battle between titan Eren and the enemy.As mentioned, I can understand the outrage of fans. The amount of changes are crazy, but lets look at it like this...Taking almost 1000 minutes of anime, and even more pages of a comic book, and trying to fit all of that into 90 minutes is just crazy! As a director myself, I can understand why things need to be altered to suit, having adapted a book into a film which didn't work out 100% as faithful as I had hoped. And the hate for these two films does become a bit overkill when you consider what massive changes the MCU does for their movies, totally shaking up the comic book world of Marvel and letting fans down - yet, it works and people accept it!Attack On Titan is not a terrible movie, quite the opposite in fact. Gorgeously made, with plenty of horror (the titan baby is quite disturbing), action and violence, the film totally entertains if you can pull yourself away from its source material, and offers something never before seen on film. Sure, its not Hollywood, but it certainly does the job!!Overall: As its own movie, Attack On Titan is pretty damn good. As an adaptation, it lets the fans down. But you can't deny its entertainment values and stunning visuals!"
" Oh come on!
",0.0,0.971,2019-11-22 00:00:00,3,"I'm a huge fan of the SnK manga and anime, and I must say that this adaptation could have been much better. In fact it was pretty awful, to say the least, when compared with the original works. The main reason was that the storyline was condensed down to a meaningless plot, and even the science of the Titans was not as interesting! Question is, how can one squeeze such a complex saga in just two movies, with each one being only around 1 hour and 30 minutes long? Guess that's why so many key details were missed out ðŸ¤·.Don't get me wrong: I don't mind minor plot changes like those in the Tokyo Ghoul adaptation, but something this big can't be right. Almost all of the major elements of the story are missing as a result of plot changes!But again, to be fair, it's not 100% bad. The CGI was good enough and the Titans were creepy as usual. In fact, they did a pretty good job with the action scenes and grim, terrifying post-apocalyptic atmosphere. But the plot is just as important, isn't it?Overall this adaptation has potential, but it's not recommended to watch it especially if you're a fan of the anime and manga. But if you're adventurous, you can try; just don't regret afterwards like what Levi and Ymir said."
" Surprisingly good for what it turned out to be...
",0.6249,0.9954,2019-11-06 00:00:00,6,"Granted, I am not familiar with the Manga, in either comic or animated series form, so I have no idea what the movie is up against. But still, I sat down to watch this, knowing basically what the outline of the movie's storyline was about. Sure, it wasn't a movie that have been high on my to-watch-list, and it has taken me 4 years to getting around to watching it.So I sat down with little expectations, and turned out that when the movie ended, I was actually genuinely entertained. Sure, this wasn't an award-winning movie in any way, but it proved to be entertaining and enjoyable for what it turned out to be.The storyline is straight forward and easily followed. But this is hardly a storyline that warrants multiple viewings. The plot just simply doesn't have enough contents to support more than a single viewing.The special effects were quite good though. Although getting used to the appearance of the titans is an acquired taste. When I saw them at first, I was actually starting to doubt that I would finish the movie. But I stuck with it, and I am glad that I did, because it sort of grew on me.As for the acting in the movie, well it was adequate for what the movie was. Good enough performances from the people on the cast list. But this is hardly a movie that is driven by an immense character driven motivation. But hey, it is what it is.""Attack on Titan Part I"" is enjoyable and I am rating it six out of ten stars, and I am actually looking forward to sitting down and watching the sequel part ""Attack on Titan II: End of the World"". However, this movie wasn't good enough to spur me to go out and start having an interest in catching up on the Manga, hardly so.This movie doesn't require much from the audience. You just unhook your brain, sit down, unwind and enjoy the ride."
" Disturbing, a bit silly, but definitely worth a watch
",0.5859,0.1316,2019-07-30 00:00:00,7,"Just finished watching it and found it enjoyable. Will watch it again. Not seen the animated so can't compare it, or have a big hissy fit about it like a lot of the reviewers seem to be having on here. The thing is a live action version is always going to disappoint if you're a fan of the animated franchise and I'm a bit surprised that so many reviewers didn't anticipate that likelihood. I'm surprised it got a 15 certificate in UK as it's very violent and gory at times. Very disturbing too, so not for kids as they'll have nightmares for years."
" Welp...
",0.0,0.4417,2019-07-10 00:00:00,3,"If you're a diehard fan of the source material then avoid this (I've only watched the anime series, so that's what I'm basing this on). It's a very thinly veiled adaptation, with only a few scenes drawn from the anime series. Character personalities, and relationships are changed, the motivation for the protagonist is totally different, and the entire backstory is changed. Outside of some character names, the walled city, and the actual Titans, there's not much more connecting this to the anime series. I gave it 3 stars because the special effects are pretty good. Is it bad...yes, but not kill it with fire bad."
" From the best

" One of the worst adapatations of a manga series so far.
",-0.6249,-0.4767,2019-06-04 00:00:00,1,CG was terrible and the movie wasn't close to decent.This is garbage when compare to the Anime.
" What a real disappointment
",-0.5106,-0.5435,2018-11-17 00:00:00,2,"Just for the very few minutes of the film and all the story is utterly wrong.
Poor special effects and the characters are out of context.
If you still want to watch it, be my guest"
" Worst live action ever!
",-0.6588,-0.8778,2018-10-15 00:00:00,2,"This is one of the worst movies I ever watched, unfortunately. I kind of liked the anime and was looking forward to seeing this live action version at the movie theater. What a disappointment! The acting is bad, the dialogues are bad, and the special effects are just ""okay"". There is actually nothing really good about this film. Well, at least it was so bad it turned out unintentionally funny! If you are a fan of Japanese cinema do yourself a favour and stay away from this work!"
" That was not Attack on Titan at all
",0.3724,-0.872,2018-10-14 00:00:00,1,"I'll make it short and leave out spoilers:This movie was a total waste of time. To think they made a second part, which managed to b e as bad as the first just blows my mind.If you want to enjoy Attack on Titan then stick to the manga and the anime.As a movie it was even worse. No storyline, no character development, no music (didn't fit), no sense making a movie like this.I'm sure even the actors feel about this movie. I sure would."
" Better Than The Anime
",0.4404,0.8126,2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie with my two other people in my residence hall, and we all agree that this movie is honestly much better than the anime."
" I don't see why people don't get it.
",0.0,0.6369,2018-05-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie was picked up by Toho back when the manga was first starting out. It wasn't supposed to be an adaptation of the anime. A fan of something should be open to other versions of the same story. A true Attack on Titan should at least think this movie is descent. It is NOT utter trash. This movie is a homage to the things that inspired he manga in he first place. This movie is not for the fans of the anime, it's for Kaiju movie fans."
" An utter failure!
",-0.5562,-0.9856,2018-05-14 00:00:00,1,"Wow! and not in the sense that it was good, wow as in how could you dare pass this off as Attack on Titan. The story strayed so much from the original content that its unrecognizable. I don't mind a retelling or different approach when creating a live-action film but to completely change its context is unacceptable, especially when your target audience are the fans who love the manga/anime so much. Eren's motivation for killing the titans was revenge for how they destroyed his hometown and eating his mother right in front of the poor kid but now its just to ease his own conscious for leaving mikasa out of the shelter to die.
Mikasa went from a strong headed female character in the anime to something completely different. And the whole point of not having Mikasa and Eren be together as a couple was a link to their backstory of being childhood friends with their father both having worked together.
Armin suddenly creates gadgets. I don't recall that at all. He was more of a strategist.
The side characters had more depth than the lead roles. 
A lot of other characters that trained with Eren weren't featured which was disappointing due to the fact that they helped influence Eren's personality throughout the manga/anime. Then we get to the real thing that pisses me off. Who the hell is this Shikishima character and why is he the armored titan and the General-Commander is the Coloussus Titan. What?! Just what?! No I can't accept such liberal recasting of who gets to be who. 
The actors didn't play their parts except for the side characters. Everything felt forced liked they were role-playing an anime instead of owning a live-action version of it.
I think an American studio would've done a better job considering that not all the humans left in the world were Japanese. I understand that its from a Japanese source but the fact of the matter is that all of humanities survivors were of different races and ethnicities which is what showcased that humanity could put aside their differences and come together to face this threat.I think the first part should've been about Eren's character development and his training then the second part should've been the next attack on wall Rose when Eren seals it with the large rock.All in all it was a huge waste of time and i couldn't wait for it to end.
Yet another failure for live-action adaptions."
" Formulaic dystopian science-fiction franchise
",0.0,0.9683,2018-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Attack on Titan is a live action adaptation of the popular anime series of the same name that was split into two movies of about ninety minutes. I haven't watched the anime series, so I have watched this film from a quite neutral point of view without any expectations. First and foremost, I simply don't understand why this franchise seems to be so popular. I'm familiar with several creative anime or manga series and their adaptations but Attack on Titan seems like an uninspired mash-up of the Divergent and The Maze Runner franchises with stereotypical characters, a predictable plot and a faceless dystopian setting. Despite being rather uninteresting at the core, this film is at least entertaining. I wouldn't call it a good movie but it wasn't as bad as many reviewers seem to claim. It's alright, no more, no less.What I disliked about the film aside of the elements already mentioned is the fact that the Titans look so silly that they make me laugh even though they are supposed to be scary and even doing quite gruesome things. They seem to be taken right out of an Ed Wood movie of the fifties. I wouldn't be surprised if this film became a cult trash flick within the next few years because of that flaw. Another element that bothered me regarding the first movie is that background information is missing and despite a short introduction, the viewer doesn't get to know much about the dystopian future portrayed in this franchise which leads to the fact that the audience won't care much about the fate of that world. The second film does a much better job at that and also quickens up the pace. A last element that should be mentioned is that most characters seem rather hollow such as the girl who is always hungry or the girl who always gets overtly excited about ancient technology. Those weird characters are rather annoying and the average acting performances don't really help to make those characters any more interesting.Among the positive elements is the fact that the film has a solid pace and never drags on too long. The suitable introduction is done in an original way. The first attack by the Titans is quite intense and gets you right into this film. The first thirty minutes of this film are definitely the best. The different characters are introduced quickly but efficiently without too many unnecessary dialogues. The direction of this film seems to be quite precise.In the end, the first part of Attack on Titan is an average dystopian science-fiction movie that convinces with a straight pace but suffers from an uninteresting universe. Obviously, you will have to watch both movies to get the bigger picture and the second film really is much better than the first part. That's why I would still recommend watching this film if you like movies such as Divergent, The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner. I guess that this movie might be more interesting for teenagers and those who are unfamiliar with the genre as more experienced audiences won't find this franchise very original."
" bad
",-0.5423,0.6957,2017-08-27 00:00:00,4,"i had low expectations but not low enough characters 0/10 story 3/10 <-- thats because they change way too much from the original and i especially didn't like the fake levi and this Mikasa hot Japanese girls 11/10SPOILER! the best part of the movie is Ayame Misaki's butt, it's also the most awkward"
" Good enough
",0.4404,0.9818,2017-07-07 00:00:00,4,"Well, one thing that this movie surely had was too much blood. I mean, the Titans could not eat the humans as a whole, but had to always cut them in half...Anyway, part from that, the movie was okay. I mean, I have seen worse. But, still, I expected this one too be super good, as everyone is so hyped over this series. So, the performances were good, but I would have liked to have a better explanation over the whole titan thing. Plus, the special effects were really not good. Not horrible, but kind of fake. The horror part I guess was supposed to be created by the creepy laughs and the weird titan mouths, as well as the blood bath. Overall, 4 out of 10, as it was kind of enjoyable, but not as good as it should have been."
" Walking Dead meets Gulliver's Travels
",-0.6486,-0.7597,2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Disclaimer: I have not read the manga nor seen the anime, so feel free to discount my opinions and continue on to other, more enlightened, reviewers. That said: this movie makes no sense what-so-ever. What's left of humanity seems to live in a walled city, protected from marauding Titans. The wall is breached by an immense deformed giant, accompanied by what appears to be a rain of meteorites. The opening in the wall is exploited by a number of smaller, but still giant, giants, who lack genitals and some, but not all, secondary sexual characteristics. These behemoths (many of whom have a 'slit-mouth', a popular Japanese horror motif) then messily devour people. Flash forward a couple of years: it has been discovered that the giants (who regenerate when damaged and were thought to be immortal) die if attacked on the nape of the neck. As this is a difficult shot to make, the humans devise a Buck Rogers-meets-Spiderman jet-powered grappling hook system (necessity is the motherÂ…). This leads to lots of cool-drenched shots of youths flying around with samurai swords, slashing open the back of giant necks. I was doing OK up to this point but then a fat giant swallowed a 'hero', and shortly thereafter, the fat giant split open and something that looked vaguely like Eddie from Iron Maiden album covers climbed out, beat up the other giants, then spontaneously expired. Upon examination of his disintegrating corpse, the ingested hero is found alive the nape of the neck, prompting one of the characters to state that this must be why the nape-blows kill the Titans. With that elucidation, the movie comes to a close (anticipating part 2, which perhaps will explain everything). That's it in a nutshell, so if this synopsis intrigues you (and how could it not?), you'll have to watch the movie. I would not that say it's a particularly good movie, but it is picturesque and a novel way to squander a couple of hours."
