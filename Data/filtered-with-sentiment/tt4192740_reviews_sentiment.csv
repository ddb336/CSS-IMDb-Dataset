" Entertaining road movie
",0.4404,0.9323,2020-06-19 00:00:00,7,"First of all i want to start with director. He is really a jack of all trades. I believe as an actor (in leyla and mecnun) he was ok, as a singer also. When i watch his movie, i feel the same for him, as a director also. He reminds me another Jack of all trades person - Cem Yilmaz. Ertan Saban as a Macedonian-Turkish actor is the best selection and fits this role 100%. I believe closing scene is not what i was expecting and could be better. Overall, i believe viewers can relate/link the characters very easily with someone they know in their lives. So movie captures the attention of viewers easily."

" Unexpected and deeply affecting.
",0.0,0.9901,2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,"I really, really liked this movie. I caught it on Netflix (USA) in the category of Turkish comedies, but it's actually anything but Turkish or really a comedy, although parts of it are an absolute riot. It's a road movie about the Balkans in general and Macedonia in particular, and although not 'sweeping' or pretentious, is one of the best movies about the Balkans I've ever seen. It initially seems to feature a kind of nervous, awkward, almost child-like guy trying, with a notable lack of any social skills, trying to transport his long-lost, drunken, profane, and violently recalcitrant brother to their father's deathbed from Istanbul to Macedonia. The road part is diverting and often screamingly funny, involving a Gypsy wedding, outsized tires, and, in a sequence that almost put me out my chair, the 'Turkish' brother's inability to read Cyrillica road signs getting them lost in such an absurd way I just couldn't handle it at all. I had to stop the movie to catch my breath. The sense of absurdity that permeates the Balkans is on full display, here, and if it's not your thing, then it's not your thing: but it is my thing, and I loved it all. Funny, funny stuff. It's the second part of the movie that took me totally by surprise and that I found deeply moving. I was expecting a kind of more-or-less typical Turkish-style comedy overdone 'family reunion' (not that those kind of movies aren't funny), but instead got something much more meaningful. It was going somewhere I couldn't quite figure out, and then came the scene where the two newly-met brothers eat a meal in a local restaurant and learn about each other, and I was just... blown away. I'm not sure I've ever before seen anything quite like it. The 'awkward' brother is revealed as a deeply responsible, moral, decent, and terribly damaged guy trying to truly do the right thing. The sense of the 'Turkish' brother being a kind of missing piece of the family puzzle was extremely moving; his homecoming to a place he's never been before is so perfect and understated it's stuck with me in a way few movies do. Maybe I'm the only one who found the messy, troublesome, but genuinely heartfelt reunion of this family emotionally devastating; I hope not. This movie would make an interesting double bill with BEFORE THE RAIN, it's that good. A lot of it's comedic but when it gets powerful, it's really powerful. Also, the early scenes of what you might call a 'mosque-crawl' are well worth the price of admission; it's some funny material: ""I'm prune-y from ablutions!"""
" So begins an entertaining road story where we witness two brothers with different cultural backgrounds
",0.4877,0.9647,2017-03-26 00:00:00,9,Limonata is a movie you will enjoy a lot if you have sympathy for road trip movies . It contains drama and mostly comedy . Fantastic cinematography!I think that as a director Ali Atay is very promising and just wanted to congratulate him for his good work in his first movie and contribution to the Turkish cinema.
" As a foreigner in Turkey
",0.0,0.1473,2017-01-04 00:00:00,5,"I am also far from my homeland and that is why when I started to watch the movie I remembered the hardships of a foreigner and I found closeness in the character of Sakip. However after they leave for Bulgaria, I do not think movie is developing towards good, it is not developing at all. Dialogues are not the job of professionals at all. Sometimes you feel that they put that scene to just fill in the blanks. Too much bad language,always drinking and anger in every situation puts audience in a bad mood as movie rolls. Swearing that much,I think,beats even ""Snatch"". Acting was good especially of Sakip (Saban), directing not so much, but I see that it was the first job of Ali Atay. Scenario is not great, it has a great beginning but not a good ending, dialogues are like the whole film crew were in a hurry. Anger and swearing killed that closeness that I talked about earlier. And I saw at the end of the movie it was dedicated to someone's father and wife, I would not send a present full of negativity (anger and swearing) to my loved ones. I would send a present where there was at least a little bit of love. Yeah love is the missing part in this move. I am not talking about that ""love"", I am talking about compassion. Anyway,aren't the most movies reflecting the spiritual (psychological) condition of the directors."
