" Disappointingly uninspiring
",-0.4404,0.634,2021-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Not on the same level as the original, unfortunately.'Ride Along 2' still isn't anything bad or overly boring, it's possibly worth a single viewing, but there is nothing to remember from the 101 minute run time - which does drag at times. The humour is average.Kevin Hart (Ben) is probably the best performer here, not so closely followed by Ice Cube (James). Ken Jeong (A.J.) has a few mildly amusing jokes at the beginning, though soon turns into a forgettable character. Olivia Munn (Maya) is meh, while Benjamin Bratt (Pope) is a dull villain. There's a good cameo from a 'Fast & Furious' actor though.I like 'Ride Along', though its follow-up is disappointingly uninspiring."
" Watching and crypto stocks on Stocktwits, guess which is better
",0.4404,0.1896,2021-03-15 00:00:00,1,"There is so little comedic value in this film between the lead duo one wonder if the producers, script writers and various groupies were high when formulating this sorry effort. None of the characters are deserving of ones' time. I feel brain dead but it's like eating a bad meal, one takes one more bite 'it really can't be that bad', oh yes it can."
" 2nd was better
",0.4404,0.5789,2020-07-19 00:00:00,8,Not often the 2nd one is better but in this case it is. Partnership between the two is just as good and the introduction of some other characters and a better villain brings the film to life.
" do we need more of this?
",0.0,-0.9328,2020-07-16 00:00:00,1,"No, we don't.
The first movie was terrible, and for some reason, somebody thought it would be a good idea to make a sequel of this horrible mess.
like abused women that go back to their abusive husband."
" Was this meant to be a comedy?
",0.3612,0.91,2020-06-30 00:00:00,2,Could possibly be one of the unfunniest comedies I have every seen. Absolute garbage.Loads of mistakes & plot holes.The only reason I decided not to give it 1 was because the only thing the film gets right is the great cars and beautiful women.If you want to watch a great cop buddy movie watch Lethal Weapon and avoid this.I promise to never watch this film ever again

" More of the same... this time in Miami
",0.0,0.9787,2019-11-06 00:00:00,7,"This film is set about a year after the previous instalment; it is about a week before Ben's wedding, having graduated from the academy he is now a probationary police officer, and soon-to-be brother in law James still doesn't think he has what it takes to be a detective. A lead in James's latest case sees the duo heading down to Miami to pick up 'AJ', a hacker who encrypted data they need to access. It soon becomes apparent that AJ is being targeted by a local crime lord who the authorities believe is a pillar of the community. This puts James and Ben in danger and sees them caught up in shootouts, car chases and other dangerous situations. This time they aren't always working alone as they work with tough Miami cop Maya Cruz.Whether you enjoy this film will be largely down to how much you enjoyed the first as it is basically the same but in a new city and with a new villain. Some freshness in injected by the addition of AJ, another fairly comical character and Maya, who is almost the female version of James. The story provides a decent amount of action which is exciting even if one never really fears for our protagonists' safety. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart are fun as James and Ben; I'm glad that the writers didn't change the dynamic between them. Ken Jeong and Olivia Munn were fun additions as AJ and Maya Cruz respectively and Benjamin Bratt was solid as bad guy Antonio Pope, even if the character was more than a little cliché. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the first film."
" Hart brings the heart
",0.0,0.9628,2019-10-07 00:00:00,6,"Loved the first one so this had fill, It's not as good or funny as Ride Along 1 but I did enjoy it, Had some really funny moments and some very sexy women topped off with some cool cars and some cool action.Cube & Hart worked really well together the chemistry is just right with the funny good cop and moody bad cop duo, The story is pretty good but nothing we haven't seen many times before."
" Let me out, now
",0.0,-0.9967,2019-08-04 00:00:00,1,"Could anything be worse than Ride Along? Hold my beer, Ride Along 2 is here.Even if you set your standards lower than minus infinity you will still be appalled at how shameless and soulless this committee-designed cash-grab sequel is. The ""plot"" is not even worth reciting, but I'll give it a go since it's been a while since I typed out something I have hated with a passion.James and Ben (Cube and Hart) are still not yet friends and Ben, now a probationary officer, is a hindrance on James' detective work. When a new lead suggests corruption down in Miami, Ben's bride-to-be/James' sister is keen for him to ride along on the case to get out of the way and stop interfering with the wedding plans. Once in Miami the pair find themselves involved in the most cliched, bolted-together, mass-produced, generic, uninspired, worthless plot you could possibly (not even) imagine (as no imagination was used to create this). I do believe that Ride Along 2 was actually manufactured by a computer that studied the algorithms of every single ""comedy"" cop movie and defecated out the most tepid, gutless script possible.How much longer can we suffer this sub-genre? I guess you could argue that Freebie and the Bean back in 1974 was the first ""buddy cop"" movie and there have been innumerable spins on it since, including 48 Hrs, Beverly Hills Cop, Lethal Weapon, Red Heat, Tango & Cash, Bad Boys (already getting stale a this point), Rush Hour (please, God, I want to die), National Security, Hot Fuzz, 21 Jump Street, Let's Be Cops, The Heat, The Other Guys, Cop Out...it just goes on and on and on. We're tired of this. It's been done to absolute effing death. Please stop!Directed by man-with-no-vision and surname-of-pure-irony Tim Story there is no director flare here and it might as well have been made by producers with a man off the street yelling ""action"" and ""cut"" taking the director credit.This movie hates you more than you hate yourself for watching it.Ride Along 3 has been greenlit. Pass me that .357 Magnum!Shot in 6K resolution with a Red Epic camera in a native 2.35:1 aspect ratio, Ride Along 2 was mastered in 2K resolution, thus losing 66.666% of the picture detail in the process. Why-oh-why do studios do this? It makes absolutely no sense. Not that I care. Cinematographer Michael Amundsen has a filmography of various ""tat"" in his career and he fills this movie with the usual hard contrast/boosted saturation that we have all come to expect from rotten comedy movies in the past decade. It looks just awful, and it would still look bad in 6K. The sound is in DTS HD-MA. If there are extras I sure as **** did not watch them."

" Unnecessary movie with even worse comedy then the first
",-0.1531,-0.5511,2019-02-23 00:00:00,4,"To me this is another one of those unnecessary sequels that basically repeats the plot of the first one with one or two things added in instead of just extending the story
This unnecessary sequel isn't interesting its just boring."
" Another Kevin Hart Bomb
",-0.4939,-0.765,2018-08-23 00:00:00,1,Bad acting and writing. Couldn't wait for this snoozefest to be over and done. Kevin Hart was terrible in this role.

" Slick, pacy, compelling
",0.2263,0.9192,2018-05-27 00:00:00,10,"Never mind the naysayers, the character dynamics, the pacing and the direction are fantastic, not to mention story, dialogue and a whole bunch more. Ha ha ha! Who wrote this stuff?"
" Ride Along 2 rides along at an even slower pace, making this the tamest ride you'll see in any thrilling theme park.
",0.4767,0.9318,2018-05-14 00:00:00,3,"Its predecessor made money, plenty of it. So for a sequel to be produced almost immediately after was inevitable, and the rushed duration of time spent creating this film clearly shows. Ben and James find themselves in Miami where intel of a drug ring leads them to investigate a respectable businessman, along with a homicide detective and hacker. I won't even lie to you, I had to look up the plot. Why? Because it was instantly forgettable. Scratch that, the whole film has been wiped from my memory. My C drive (that's Cranium Drive...heh heh) has been fragmented and abolished. I couldn't possibly replay, recite or reenact any scene from this film. Well, except the car chase that was stylised to look like 'Grand Theft Auto III', which makes no sense given the current generation game consoles and ruining a perfectly good car chase sequence with pixelated polygons. Hart and Cube's ""comedy"" has resorted to very loud shouting and screaming, where the former yet again didn't make me laugh once. Mind you, the whole film in its entirety made me feel dead inside. Munn actually did the best she could given the lacklustre material, and most certainly looked the part. The first ten minutes felt like a 'Fast & Furious' parody, given the inclusion of Gibson as well...which really left me confused. Is Ride Along 2 actually a spoof film disguised as an action comedy where it parodies all things wrong with franchise entertainment in every media industry!? No. It's just bad. The idyllic Miami environment was a welcomed change to any generic urban city, I mean there is a clubbing scene, plenty of floral attire and Hart eating hairy nachos on a picturesque beach. What more could one want! Yet, the forgettable plot and lack of humour resulted in a failed sequel. Wait...it's just dawned on me...this is very similar to '22 Jump Street' which also has Ice Cube. Coincidence? I think not! Anyway, no more please. I don't want to be watching a third one, like at all."
" YOU WOULD RUN FROM YOU
",0.0,0.1901,2018-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Our unlikely duo teams up again. After they make a bust in Atlanta the trail leads them to Miami as they chase A.J. (Ken Jeong) ""a low budget Jackie Chan"" who can read the thumb drive they captured. This was one of a number of such lines that could be taken out of the context of the script, At one time Hart says to Ice Cube ""You want to be responsible for ruining my career?"" I could see that. Or When Hart feels he has to tell us, """"I'm acting.""Once again Hart saves the film and Ice Cube (In more than one way) and uses skills he learned from video games, perhaps the memorable scene of the feature. Bad guy Benjamin Bratt appears to be impersonating Ricardo Montalban for much of his role. I was waiting to hear something about Corinthian Leather, but it never happened.The film was fun on the formula scale. I had one delayed Laugh Out Loud moment. It is a film you can rent or wait until it flops in price.Guide: 2 words. No sex, or nudity. Bikinis and some sex talk. Toned down from first film."
" A good airplane or netflix movie
",0.4404,0.9766,2018-04-21 00:00:00,6,"I saw the first Ride Along on an airplane, and then watched it again a year later because I'd forgotten I already saw it. That's pretty much the sequel. Very generic but somewhat fun. I wish there were more bits with Kevin Hart switching to video game mode. The soundtrack was very good, but overall there really should have been more laughs. Also I like Benjamin Bratt and wish he had better/more roles."
" But if your really in the mood for an action-comedy.....
",0.0,0.9962,2017-06-02 00:00:00,6,"I Have to admit I was suckered in by the trailer, it was exciting and action packed. I thought they were doing a Bad Boys style movie, boy was I wrong. This was like a long TV episode of an American crime show like NCIS, Hawaii Five-O, or CSI but not as intriguing or engaging.All the action is in the trailer. There's about 3 action scenes and all 3 are not that new or good, they're the type you'd see in standard TV shows. There's some poor computer game animation mixed into one action sequence(cus Kevin Hart's character loves to play computer games) which totally ruins the rhythm of that action sequence and ruins the enjoyment of it. The end action sequence looks like they couldn't be bothered, something you would have gotten in a straight-to- video 80s/90s action flick.It wasn't a good comedy either, there was about 3-4 little chuckles throughout from some of the audience including myself for some of the one liners. I read before i went in to watch this sequel that it was more of an actioner than comedy but for me it didn't deliver in either.I wasn't expecting anything new or groundbreaking storywise but at least give me something to keep me interested but its a film that came across as if they took scenes from loads of other similar films and just copy/pasted them together.It all just looked WAY too familiar and not in a good way.So overall i don't see any reason to recommend paying hard earned money to watch it at the cinema. I'd recommend waiting until it comes on TV,as it is like a TV episode anyway. Then at least you can switch over to another channel if your not feeling it.If you do want to go to the cinema to watch a comedy then i would definitely recommend DADDY'S HOME if it's still out, very very funny, you will defo leave with a smile on your face.But if your really in the mood for an action-comedy then i would recommend SPY,which was out in 2015 and is out on DVD now. Great action, very funny and very entertaining. Everyone i know that's seen it loved it."
" Ride Along 2 Review
",0.0,0.9735,2017-05-28 00:00:00,5,"Ride Along 2 is by no means going to win any awards, but it is fun ride. Why the low rating from me? Stick around and find out.Synopsis: The RIDE ALONG 2 sequel picks up about a year after our heroes' last adventure. Plans for a quick trip to Miami go bad. With the wedding upcoming, James reluctantly takes Ben with him to Miami to follow up on a lead connected to a drug ring case he's been trying to crack. In Miami, they meet Maya, a no-BS homicide detective who lets them know Miami is her turf. They also encounter AJ, a shady cocky computer hacker who reveals evidence that implicates a well- respected local businessman, the wealthy Antonio Pope. Pope harbors a vicious streak and rules South Florida's drug trade. If Ben and James can convince the authorities that Pope is a brutal crime boss they'll stop his spree. If they fail, well there may not be a wedding after all. Starring: Ice Cube, Kevin Hart Director: Tim StorySo you know this movie was made because of the immense popularity of the two stars. The fact the first movie was actually really good and had great chemistry from the two stars you knew the second was getting made. There already is talk of a third one, and I can see why. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart played off each other so well. They are the selling point of the movie.All the movie is is a buddy cop movie. Nothing more, nothing less. If you are going into this movie thinking you are going to see some epic story or action or acting you might as well skip this movie. Take it for what it is.Now, for the low rating. There is a part in the movie where they start doing a video game type of filming. It was uncalled for. It lasted about three minutes and was a waste of time. They should have just left it as a regular car chase and got it over with.That's not to say that is the only reason for the low rating. All you got throughout the movie was your normal troupes for this kind of movie.Final Thoughts: Going into this movie thinking you are getting a simple movie. Don't expect it to be great. It's that simple. It's still a fun watch though.Rating: 5 out of 10"
" Rehashes a lot of what we saw in the first film, but it still contains some amusing moments
",0.5267,0.978,2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Mismatched Atlanta cops and soon to be brothers-in-law James Payton (Ice Cube) and Ben Barber (Kevin Hart) are back and this time Payton is on a case involving a wealthy businessman Antonio Pope (Benjamin Bratt) who he believes is involved in a major drug-trafficking operation. Payton is intent on cracking this case alone, but reluctantly agrees to take Barber along for the 'ride' to give his sister some space to make he final wedding arrangements. How will our 'chalk and cheese' duo face second time around?In the first Ride Along film the plot was on the thin side and it was reliant upon Ice Cube and Kevin Hart's chemistry to make up for its rather generic story. It kind of worked in the first film and it kind of works in this film as well.The main problem with this film is that it does rehash a lot of the jokes that we saw in the first film; the 'fish-out-of-water' stuff with Kevin Hart in the first film was quite funny - even though it did play out as a comedy version of Training Day. What you basically get in the sequel is the same thing which is still quite funny, but it doesn't feel quite as believable the second time around and it lacks the freshness of the first film - could Ben Barber still be this inept and did he not learn anything from the first film? This kind of lack of continuity does hurt the film slightly.As with the first film, the plot is extremely thin and unfocused and our villain of the piece is given no real development. Like the first film, this felt like the slow-motion action sequences and computer animation were more important than the story itself - although I must confess that I thought that the computer animation sequences were a nice touch and were quite funny to watch.Thankfully, the chemistry between Ice Cube and Kevin Hart is still as good as it was in the first film and this is probably the sole thing that makes this film watchable; they're both good in their roles and they seemed to have been injected with more likability second time around. I actually found Hart slightly less annoying in this film and think that he might be starting to grow on me. Benjamin Bratt was effective as the villain (considering he had very little to work with).Whilst I didn't think Ride Along 2 was a brilliant film I have to say that I wasn't bowled over by the first film either and in my opinion Ride Along 2 is every bit as good or bad as the first film. If you liked the first film and don't mind watching another rehash then you should be fine with this sequel. It's watchable, providing you keep your expectations on the low side."
" Better than the first film
",0.4404,0.9744,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,Much better than the first Ride Along movie.Kevin Hart is much less annoying in this movie. Ken Jeong complements Hart nicely and gives us a second funny guy. Olivia Munn is very good. Less of just Hart + Ice Cube. More of a cast. No Leguizmo who was supporting actor in the first one and was awful. Kevin Hart's girlfriend / fiancé was good again. Sherri Shepard was good in a small role. Fighting Kevin Hart (verbally). Good back and forth.Much more of a cast and not just Hart + Ice Cube.The story is interesting. The hacker. Benjamin Bratt as the bad guy. The parties. The Miami scene. All enjoyable. Good action scenes. Not just Hart running his mouth non-stop.Hardly any of Kevin Hart endlessly asking Ice Cube why he doesn't like him which was not funny at all in the first one. Less of Ice Cube sneering at Hart and occasionally even liking Hart which was nice. There were so many dull boring parts in the first one between those two. Much less of that in the 2nd film and this film is much better off for it.
