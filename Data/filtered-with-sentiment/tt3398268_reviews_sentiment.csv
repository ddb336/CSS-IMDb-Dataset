" Ghibli's Sweetest
",0.0,0.9776,2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"When Marnie was There is a fantastic entry into the Ghibli catalogue and offers and grounded and emotional coming of age story. Truly a masterful piece of cinema, using its beautiful animation to carry the emotional rich stories and incredible characters. Hiromasa Yonebayashi shows off his incredible skills as a filmmaker rivalling the genius founder of studio ghibli himself. Overall When Marnie was There offers an emotionally rich story that delves into the psyche of a mentally ill girl as she learns to love herself through the amazing Marnie."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,0.8776,2020-12-08 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe this movie has a 7.7 rating as of this writing. Are there any real non-profit people writing reviews any more? What is so good about this movie that some think this deserves a 10? I was so disappointed, to the point of being upset, with the stupidity of the story I came here in hopes to find a low 5 star review. Now I'm disappointed at humanity, but honestly hope these positive reviews are from paid PR firms."
" good but definitely can be better...
",0.6705,0.9865,2020-11-01 00:00:00,4,"The main & base of the story is great I really admire it main story is a girl through deja vu remember her grandma but she thought she is her friend and after some happenings she know that Marnie is her grand mother.
but the narrating of this great story was too much terrible they make this beautiful story like a mystery and puzzle!!
I'm really certain they inspirated from ""SHUTTER ISLAND"" in this movie but the imitation was too much bad and obvious!! (only Shutter Island fans know what I said!!)
I hope in the future someone else make another movie with this story but in the true way!!"
" Masterpiece

" Very good anime
",0.4927,0.9176,2020-10-03 00:00:00,9,"When Marine Was There is a 2014 anime drama featuring the voices of Hailey Steinfield,Genna Davis,John C Reilly and Kiernan Shpoka and tells the story of a lonely 12 year old girl named Anna who suffers from Asthma. Because of this she is sent to stay with her foster parents. However Anna meets a mysterious young girl named Marine and the two become best friends. But is Marine all she seems to be?Overall I really enjoyed this film. I haven't watched all the Studio Ghilbi films(only this and Your Name)but I liked this one.
Thumbs up and give it a chance."
" Boring lesbian love story.
",0.4404,0.7043,2020-09-12 00:00:00,2,"People love this movie just because it's about lesbians. All LGBT movies have high ratings. Anyway, this film is boring and has nothing special over any other typical LGBT love story films."
" Beautiful but confusing at times...
",0.0258,0.3437,2020-08-25 00:00:00,7,"This is a beautiful story, but the way in which it is delivered is slightly confusing at times...The story starts with a girl (Anna) who is riddled with insecurity and self doubt, struggles with her emotions and has bad asthma. Her guardian sends her away one summer to live with some of her relatives in a quieter seaside town... At this stage the story is all about Anna coming to terms with who she is, and is quite similar to a lot of teenage ""coming of age"" stories.Then the story shifts gears and Anna befriends a girl called Marnie, who lives in a seemingly abandoned house across the water / marshes. It is here that the story lacks a bit of consistency and becomes a little less compelling, if not more intriguing. Marnie may not be quite what she seems, and through her Anna may find answers to the questions which plague her and fuel her self doubt / emotional pain.The story here just feels a bit lightweight and thin, when it should really be heavier and more emotionally heavy hitting, drawing you in. There are moments which succeed, but some of the dialogue is a little flimsy and cliched, and Marnie's character is a little too one dimensional.The animation is Ghibli at its absolute best, there is genuinely no film with better animation in their back catalogue than this, and the soundtrack is very pretty.A really lovely film with a great story, it's just a shame they didn't give the story more of the power that it deserved."
" A bit bland for a Ghibli film
",0.0,-0.654,2020-07-26 00:00:00,5,"Entertainment value: 5 Visuals: 7 Soundtrack: 6 Plot: 5 World building and depth: 5 Characters and dialog: 3 Total: 5The good: It has some solid animation, as always for ghibli. I take her encounter with Marnie as hallucinations, in that case I think it is the first Ghibli film exploring mental illness and confusion in such a way.The bad: You will never want to hear the name ""Marnie"" again, seriously, it is repeated so many times in the film it is ridiculous. The character development is a bit strange and the plot is not always predictable but also not interesting."
" Superb story telling
",0.6249,0.7893,2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,I was more than pleasantly suprised by this film was not what I expected and exceeded my expectations immensely. Fantastic storytelling and a gripping relationship make this story one to remember indeed.
" I Loved It.
",0.5994,0.9887,2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,"The 3rd best Ghibli film . Easily. Just behind Spirited Away & From Up on Poppy Hill. Just everything about this works.Every character, even the minor ones, are so well defined and real feeling. Anne was great, Marnie was great, Anne's Caretakers were great, that painter lady who I can't remember the name of. Even though I don't remember their names they were still great.The plot, while confusing at times, was so interesting and emotionally investing. It came to such an amazingly powerful and satisfying conclusion. And it has a really cool and compelling twist in there to.It goes without saying that the animation is great so I'm not going to elaborate. I also loved the music. One problem I find with a few Ghibli films is how sparse the score can be. Like some scenes will really need music but they have none. Not here. It's just a present as it needs to be and it's beautiful. And the credits song ""Fine of the Outside"" is going to become one of my favourites. I can already tell.I also has very few problems with the dub. Again. It's second only to Spirited Away in that regard. Spirited Away having a flawless dub. This movie's dub, while not perfect, was better than most. Any moments that felt off were very brief and never godawful.What really sells this movie is the relationship between Marnie & Anne. There's no word for it other than perfect.There's really nothing more to say except restating that I loved it. I'd give it 96%"

" Confusion of Marnie
",-0.296,0.6486,2020-06-04 00:00:00,7,"I think that movie is two different movies, because the first part, sounds like a a fantasy journey of the protagonist for discover more about herself and your feelings, but the second part is about family, and when this tow things come together, stay a bit weird, but has a nice message and a emotional ending."
" One of the best Studio Ghibli films
",0.6369,0.9124,2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,"This film has a lot of emotional depth. We get so sucked in to this girl's story about acceptance and other universal themes that everyone can relate to. As usual, there is also Studio Ghibli's excellent nostalgic style and attention to detail. This film vastly exceeded my expectations. Overall, this is a masterpiece that ranks up with their other great films."
" HAUNTING.
",-0.2732,0.0356,2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,I am not a big fan of animated films as I find there are only a few that appeal to me without relying on cute-ness. Marnie was Here is one such film. I found the storyline very relatable despite living a life different from the characters. Also they have taken all the pains to represent it craftily. It tugged at my heart strings. I am writing this review 5 years after watching it. I made my wife watch it the other day and she loved it too.
" A masterpiece
",0.6249,0.9987,2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,"Wow did this movie take me by surprise with how much I loved this movie. When Marnie was there was a movie that I had been wanting to see for a good while but I never got around to watching it till now because this movie was included with HBO Max so I finally got the chance to sit down and watch it and I'm glad I did because this movie was just truly beautiful from start to finish and there is a lot to like about this movie. The cast in this movie was just amazing everyone did a fantastic job playing there characters and honestly they became there characters. The characters in this movie all are great too, each character is very important to this story and plays an important part. This movie also has a mystery and I have to say the mystery was so well done and had me trying to piece everything together throughout the whole movie. The story in this movie is also fantastic and well executed from start to finish. The animation in this movie was also stunning to look at and was just so beautiful. The music is also amazing and it honestly plays an important part in the story. Overall, I am surprised it took me this long to watch this masterpiece of a movie and I honestly can't wait to watch it again."

To say any more would spoil the movie.You are always eager to see what happens next to Anna, and the mix of everyday life and a more dream-like story go so well together."

" MYSTERIOUS STUNNING SWEET MASTERPIECE
",0.8658,0.9989,2019-05-13 00:00:00,8,"Alert ! If you want to watch this film, you must get out the tissues. because it is a wreching movie.""When Marnie was there"" is the last film from the Studio Ghibli that directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and addapted from Joan G. Robbinson's book. it decidely British ghost story, a withdrawn teen girl, a mysterious blonde girl who may or not actually exist.The film is about a girl named 'Anna' who is clinically depressed. she said ""I hate my self"", so she hopes that she was dead. and she said ""there are some people who fit in the circle and there are some that are outside"". This is kind of deppression. she is an orphan who is being rase by a foster mother. that makes she can't get along with other kids at school, and she got breathless. therefore, her foster mother was so worried her, and decide to sent anna to a village to help her asthma and get her emotions back from this dark place. Anna's hobby is sketching. Finally, in the village she found a teenage girl like her. her name is Marnie. she has long blonde hair, blue eyes and seems like almost a ghost on the lake. Actually, when i see marnie i think she is a ghost but not. I think she like a shadow.In here, you can see how beautiful friendship is. Friendship and knowledge is what gives us hope and makes Anna realizes that she want to love herself and be brand new. This animation is so gorgeous in the countryside. i'm very appreciate ghibli's creature. this is the best.The best also is the soundtrack !. The sound is excellent. so pure like real life. I can feel the sound of nature in the countryside, moreover the sound of rain, thunder, wind, and water are so authentic. I feel like i was there. and the soundtrack is so calm, nice and very suitable for this film. the song is Fine on the outside by Priscilla Ahn. this is one of my favorite songs too.The mystery surprised me at the ending this film. it overwhelmed me. because the story, animation, and sounds are stunning.Like the previous Studio Ghibli's movie are 'Spirited Away' that the best than this film. Although, 'When Marnie Was There isn't up to the incredibly high standard of the best Ghibli films. it still beautiful and sweets. i like it.The last creature by Studio Ghibli is great and makes us remembered always. 'When Marnie Was There' is truly a Studio Ghibli classic guranteed to warm your heart.thank you."

After the wonderful Secret World of Arrietty, When Marnie was there is an equally captivating story, which may just use up all your stock of Kleenex! (Not a joke!)
It's a story about friendship, family and tragedy, a tale of a shy young woman trying to navigate this world, and the timeless and unbreakable bonds that bring her to the light and out of her shell.It's one of those stories that are beautifully told, beautifully drawn, have a touching soundtrack and to end it all, a plot twist that does a number on your tear ducts!As I said, do not watch without a box of Kleenex!"
" Sweet and simple, but lacking magic
",0.25,0.6124,2019-03-19 00:00:00,6,"When Marnie was there is a sweet and simple story that will appeal to anyone who feels like they don't belong. However, the plot stumbles a few times along the way and it doesn't feel as magical as other Studio Ghibli creations. It's worth a watch, but it's not one I'd add to my collection."
" When Marnie Was There is a charming movie that feels completely pointless
",0.5859,0.9854,2019-01-31 00:00:00,5,"When Marnie Was There is a movie that deals with a very important message (depression, not really liking who you are as a person, and the lack of connection between other people), but sadly it's as deep as a puddle and most of the plot feels... Pointless?We see the main character, Anna, having to travel to a small village for a while due to a health issue and her having to breathe fresh air. The whole plot revolves around her coming into contact with Marnie, which has a mysterious past and a rough childhood.Most of the movie consists of fairly harmless scenes about their friendship, which is cool, but doesn't push the plot forwards at all. Near the end of the movie, we finally get the answer to who Marnie is, but it's some of the most underwhelming reveals I've ever seen.The plot feels like it's leading up to something that's not really there, and the ending feels like a weird ""and then everything everyone lived happily ever after"" situation that doesn't feel earned at all.That said, I did kind of enjoy this movie. The animation is gorgeous (VERY gorgeous!), and the scenes were good enough to keep me interested on what'll happen next. It's a decent family movie, but I sadly didn't connect with it as much as others did."
" A very mediocre Ghibli movie.
",0.0,0.918,2018-10-12 00:00:00,4,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Ghibli fan. I love Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away and Porco Rosso. But this film was very disappointing. The movie falls in the category 'but is was only a dream'-type of movie. You'll find out there's something about Marnie (not going to spoil it) but the way the story unfolds is so poorly executed you will most likely only enjoy it if you don't think too much about what is happening.Here's a few examples; the adults in this film are merely decorative. None of the adults have a purpose except for moving the story along. There's no real interaction and what interaction there is is just weird. How come Anna's guardians don't really care about what she's doing? Everything she does is fine and they never talk to her. We only see them being happy as campers and that's it.The whole focus of this film is on Marnie and Anna, and the world besides this doesn't come to life. There are shots put in of the environment and despite looking great they feel forced. Ghibli used to be great at this but they don't seem to be capable of creating this engaging world they so often showcased in other films. Also the one other character Anna interacts with also feels like an important pawn but nothing more. It's a very colourful character but the way she all of a sudden appears to be a major part of the plot makes no sense.And the last thing is Anna her clumsiness. Holy cow, she falls and stumbles and staggers so many times it's ridiculous! It happens so often that it distracts from the movie.So all in all it's just a hard to believe story. If you're good at ignoring details and fawning over Ghibli you'll enjoy it. If you enjoy proper story telling I'd suggest to skip this one and go for one of the other excellent movies Ghibli has made in the past decades."
" My favorite movie ever?
",0.4588,0.6509,2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,"Marnie is filled with wonderful visuals, great music, but what really wins me over is Anna the protagonist. It's probably not really the best movie ever, but I love how we start the movie by seeing Anna's strengths and weaknesses. She is a great tween artist who struggles with terrible depression. I consider myself an artist and though I am happy now, I wasn't always, especially in my early teens. I have never connected with a character like I did her. After watching this movie I struggled to get to bed and was actually depressed the next day. This movie forced the questions on me; Who am I? What should I be doing with my life? Although it may be hard to recommend to people with very different problems, it really spoke to me, and is one of my absolute favorites."

" Something of Universal Relevance
",0.0,0.9899,2017-09-28 00:00:00,10,"Joan G. Robinson's novel ""When Marnie Was There"" is a favourite of mine and has long enjoyed great popularity in Britain, but I was surprised to learn that it is also known in Japan. The original novel is set in a seaside village in Norfolk, but this animated version transfers the action to the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The characters become Japanese rather than English, although the names of the two main characters, Anna and Marnie, have been retained. Rather oddly, Marnie remains a blue-eyed blonde, as she was in the book: Anna is a brunette, but nevertheless has large round blue eyes. Now characters, especially female characters, in anime often look surprisingly Caucasian, even when they are supposed to be Japanese. In this case, however, Marnie is the daughter of an English father and Japanese mother. (There is also an explanation for Anna's blue eyes, but I won't say what it is as that would be to give away too much of the ending).In this version Anna is a shy, withdrawn and introverted girl, probably aged about 12, living in Sapporo with her foster-parents, with whom she has lived ever since her real parents were killed in a car crash and her grandmother died soon afterwards. Because she suffers from asthma, Anna is sent away from the city to live with Mr & Mrs Oiwa, relatives of her stepmother, in a rural seaside town. Anna has always found it difficult to make friends; she feels that all the rest of the world is inside an invisible circle and that she is on the outside. At first does not seem any happier at the seaside than she did in Sapporo, but things change when she meets Marnie, a girl living in a large house by the sea.The two girls form a close friendship, the first either has ever known, but there is something strange about Marnie, who asks Anna to keep their relationship a secret and who seems to appear and disappear mysteriously. Nobody seems to know anything about her or her family, and her house, although obviously once grand, seems dilapidated and abandoned. Anna finds herself wondering whether her new friend is real, or a ghost, or a figment of her imagination. Eventually Marnie seems to disappear for good, but Anna is befriended by another family who have recently arrived in the village, especially their daughter Sayaka, and this leads to the truth about Marnie, and about Anna's own past, eventually being revealed.When I was younger, animated movies always seemed like something specifically American; Disney seemed to have the market in full-length cartoons sewn up. In more recent decades, however, Disney seem to have abandoned the traditional hand-drawn cartoon in favour of computer animation, and their mantle has passed to Japan, particularly Studio Ghibli. The Ghibli style, however, is very different from the Disneys which I used to love as a child- less stylised, more realistic and with more subdued colours. The visual look of ""When Marnie Was There"" is particularly attractive; I have never been to Hokkaido, but the mountainous landscapes depicted here conjure up the same sort of sense of place which Robinson achieved with her descriptions of the very different Norfolk coast.Much as I love Robinson's book, it does have a couple of minor weaknesses. She never fully explains why Anna is allowed to take so much time off school and what becomes of her biological father after his divorce from her mother. There is perhaps something of a slackening of intensity in the third quarter of the book, between Anna's final meeting with Marnie and the denouement. In the film, however, all these matters are addressed or resolved. Anna's absence from school is explained by her health condition, and Anna's mother is only married once; the man who dies with her in the accident is Anna's father, not her stepfather. The pacing is also better, with no perceptible slackening, possibly because Sayaka, who emerges as Anna's new friend and confidante, is a more well-developed figure than Priscilla, the equivalent character in the book.On the surface, Robinson's novel is a simple tale of the friendship between two young girls, but beneath that surface it is surprisingly deep, tackling the interrelated subjects of loneliness, friendship, bereavement and parental neglect. All of these elements are covered in as much depth in the film version which, I feel, in some respects even manages to improve upon the book. With this film Studio Ghibli have succeeded in the difficult task of taking a story very much rooted in one culture, transferring it to another, very different culture (with only a few minor changes to the plot) and producing something of universal relevance. A beautiful film. 10/10"
" The characters have absolutely no personality, and the story incredibly dull
",-0.669,0.9882,2017-09-28 00:00:00,3,"There is no denying that When Marnie was there is a gorgeous film, with a beautiful soundtrack and every frame a painting. But that's about all it's good for. Take away the lovely animation and the brilliant composition, then all that's left is a dull and mediocre story.My main problem is the main character, Anna. As someone with asthma myself, I must say she is not only unrelatable, but also unlikable. Poor, poor Anna. You're born into a gorgeous middle- class family, have two loving guardians, have people who want to befriend you despite your empty and soulless personality. It must be terrible living in such a beautiful, hundred-acre house with a garden and surrounded by mountains, lakes and forests. Unbearable, I say. What's that, you immediately dislike a girl you didn't know other than the fact that she looks 'ugly and fat'? You insulted her as well, after an attempt to be your friend? Gosh, I can't imagine how miserable I would be if I were her. Then you meet a pretty rich blond girl and you instantly become friends? That's cool.First of all, can we really say Anna is a role model for girls? Doesn't she just inspire you with her boringness? She is constantly depressed and humourless, not to mention emotionless most of the time. This girl lives a sheltered, well-provided life and she's bitching about it because her foster parents are getting child benefits. She's never faced a single true hardship about life, not even her sickness. It doesn't serve to empower her will to live by the end, only as an excuse for her to come to beautiful countryside hide-out that's the setting of the movie.I feel like all the movie's good for is for viewers to admire the breathtaking animation. Take that away and this is just another hollow movie with no real drive, tension or plot. Overpraised is what I would say."
" Sweet and touching
",0.4588,0.0516,2017-09-16 00:00:00,6,"WHEN MARNIE WAS THERE is a sweet and touching family drama from those gifted animators at Studio Ghibli. The story involves a lonely young girl who goes to live with her aunt and becomes entranced by an abandoned old mansion by a lake. She soon befriends a young blonde-haired girl living there and the two develop a friendship, but mystery remains regarding her new friend's identity. As with many recent Ghibli films, this one's set in a recognisable real world and is less fantasy-oriented than their older classics. It's sublimely made, as always, and features a plot which layers on the emotion and feelings until the final, moving twist."
" More striking anime from Studio Ghibli.
",0.0,0.9374,2017-08-29 00:00:00,8,"""When Marnie Was There"" is a strikingly beautiful animated feature from the renowned Studio Ghibli. Based on a British novel of the same name, the story follows Anna, a troubled teenager who finds friendship and ultimately revelation in Marnie, a mysterious young girl who seems to live both in Anna's world and in her dreams. Like all Ghibli productions, the animation is lush, detailed and fluid. The voice work in the English version I watched is good despite being somewhat flat and generic at times. I very much like Studio Ghibli movies but find in general that anime adds more to fantasy films (where it can make unreal real, such as ""Howl's Moving Castle"" or ""Spirited Away"") than it does to more 'realistic' films such as ""When Marnie Was There"". Despite that, and being both the wrong gender and decades away from the target audience, I really enjoyed, and would recommend, ""When Marnie Was There""."
" Good enough
",0.4404,0.9646,2017-03-23 00:00:00,4,"Obviously I'm one of the few who weren't impressed by this movie. It wasn't that it lacked the fantasy, magical effect; on the contrary, it was quite enjoyable, with the beautiful landscapes and the detailed scenes. However, the story kind of dragged on. I guess it's is mainly me that was bothered by that and in general, this movie is quite good. The story is interesting, though it gets confusing with the way the relationship between the two girls is developed and the fact that Anna, although agreeing that there is something ""fishy"" about Marnie, on the very next scene she continues on like nothing has happened. Towards the end, things get way too obvious, but at least the ending was good and satisfying, as it didn't left any case unsolved and every story got a happy closure. So, 4 out of 10."
" Wondrous film on all counts
",0.0,0.9792,2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"It is a very rare thing that I will give a movie a rating of 10, but ""When Marnie Was There"" deserves every bit of it. I will offer no spoilers by discussing any aspect of plot, but will say this: the characters, story line, animation and conclusion formed as perfect a film as I've ever seen. This is especially surprising since it is animated, but then we have come to expect a high bar being set from Studio Ghibli.A note in advance: this isn't for adrenaline junkies. The plot is slow-moving and non-pivotal, but it flows so smoothly and the story is told so very well that the time just passes by. The wrap-up is superb, characters and story-telling holding true to the last.It is difficult to pick a Ghibli film as the ""best"", but I would certainly recommend this as a starter to the company's line. It's nothing like Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away-- but it is certainly a top-of-the-muffin creation.Ten Stars. Absolutely."
" Mixed feelings, but a good film
",0.5927,0.9975,2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"I tend to watch everything produced by Ghibli because their movies are astounding: the glorious artistic animation, the magic lighting, the wonderful colors, the picturesque landscaping, the attention to the detail, the way they capture daily life no matter the stories happen in urban or rural settings. Besides, the people at Ghibli do spend as much time on drawing the movie as on creating the story and developing the characters. Their stories are always a mix of the mundane and the celestial, the worldly and the dreamy, the ordinary and the extraordinary in life, the matter of fact and the inexplicable. Ghibli's movies are always sentimental, emotional, dramatic and fun, all at once.When Marnie was There is no exception. The film is based on Joan G. Robinson's children eponymous book published in 1967. The story is really lovely, and goes in a full circle to explore the feelings of alienation, angst, lovelessness and loneliness of the main character, Anna, a tomboy girl who hates herself and her life and has bouts of asthma out of stress. Most of the story occurs in her relatives' country house, where Anna's auntie and foster mother sends her to see if she recovers her health and joy for life. There, in this remote and pristine area of Japan, in an abandoned house, she meets the almost-Disney girly girl blonde Marnie, who becomes her best friend and does the miracle of opening Anna's heart to love. Kids and teens who experience this sense of abandonment, loneliness and alienation, will certainly connect with Anna's struggle to be herself, to open up and overcome her fear of rejection, and to opening to love, romantic and non romantic. Adults will love the magic realism of the film, the inexplicable synchronicity that leads to the end, and the overall spicy sweetness of the story. My mixed feelings about the film rely on the apparently queer relationship of the two teens. This wouldn't be a problem if the story didn't end as it ends, or the story was one with explicit queer love. I haven't read the book, so I don't know whether the relationship was expressed the same in the novel or not, but it was a distraction for me. For young queers trying to find their identity and fit in the world, the film will be a thrill, but for those who aren't it will be mostly a what-is-this-doing-here? moment. If Ghibli wanted to explore that part, great, no problem, but if that is the case I expect the story to be open about it, clearer about it, the characters to be related differently and the movie to end differently. I think part of the problem with the lack of success of the film it is just the apparent lack of inner congruency.I felt that Sayaka was a wonderful character to explore, but we barely get to know her. The same can be said about Anna's hosts the Oiwa, who are truly a funny interesting couple, and of the character of Marnie's childhood friend and paintress Oisako. On the other hand, the story is mostly an exploration of Anna's character, and the film does so perfectly well.Overall, this is a beautiful movie to watch with many layers of meaning and interpretation. Not a movie for children unless under supervision, and more for young adults and adults."
" When Marnie Was There
",0.0,-0.651,2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"I found out about this Japanese cartoon movie, from Studio Ghibli, mainly because of its inclusion in the Oscar nominations, I was always going to watch this, both to see if I agree with this accolade, and as a fan of many films from the studio. Basically shy 12-year-old Anna Sasaki (Hailee Steinfeld) lives with her foster parents, Yoriko (Geena Davis) and her husband, in Sapporo, she is distant and unhappy, for health reasons she is sent to spend the summer with Yoriko's relatives, Setsu (Grey Griffin) and Kiyomasa Oiwa (John C. Reilly), in a rural seaside town. While there, Anna is fascinated by an abandoned mansion, dilapidated and overgrown, across the marsh, she wonders why it seems familiar to her, it has been empty for a long time, but Anna has visions of the house looking well and people residing in it. One night, following an argument, Anna runs away, she finds a boat and rows across to the mansion, there she is greeted by beautiful, good-natured blonde girl Marnie (Kiernan Shipka), Anna tells her about her dreams, but Marnie assures her she is not dreaming now, they agree to keep meeting in secret, but the next day, when Anna plans to see Marnie, the mansion has returned to its abandoned and dilapidated state. A week later, while sketching, Anna meets older woman Hisako (Vanessa Williams) who paints pictures of the mansion and marsh, she comments that Anna's sketches look like a girl she used to know when she was young, and she used to live in the mansion, which is being renovated for someone moving in. Anna returns to the mansion, she meets a girl named Sayaka (Ava Acres), she discovers Marnie's diary in a drawer, it includes text about a party Anna may have been part of, several pages of the diary are missing. The next day, Marnie reappears and talks to Anna about her parents always travelling abroad, her nanny and two maids and their physical and psychological abuse, Anna wants to help her confront her fear of the silo, where she used to be threatened of being locked in, Anna falls asleep, and is upset to find Marnie has abandoned her in the silo. Meanwhile, Sayaka and her brother finds the missing diary pages, including mention of the silo, they find Anna there in a feverish state, during which she dreams of confronting Marnie, who apologises for leaving her, and telling her she can no longer see her, Marnie begs Anna for forgiveness, Anna vows to remember Marnie as she is swept away by the tide. Anna recovers from her fever, Sayaka shows her the missing pages and a painting Hisako gave to Marnie, Hisako tells them Marnie's story. Marnie married Kazuhiko, who died from an illness, they had a daughter named Emily, Marnie was committed to a psychiatric hospital and Emily was sent to boarding school, when Marnie was released Emily was upset for her abandoning her, she ran away and had a daughter of her own, she and her husband were killed in a car accident, Marnie raised her granddaughter until her death, the girl was put in foster care. It is the end of summer, Yoriko is taking Anna home, she gives Anna a photograph of the mansion that belonged to her grandmother, she realises she is the daughter of Emily and Marnie's granddaughter, this revelation brings Anna closure of her identity, she bids her friends of the town goodbye, and sees the mansion and Marnie one last time as she is taken back home. Also starring Catherine O'Hara as the Elderly Lady, Ellen Burstyn as Nanny and Kathy Bates as Mrs. Kadoya. The cast dubbing the voices into English are all chosen well, it is a fairly simple story of a pubescent tomboy girl unknowingly going back in time to meet the younger version of her relative, it is perhaps more realistic than previous films from the studio, no magical and fantasy elements as such, it hasn't got quite the same charm as these other films, but the animation is fantastic, overall its not a bad animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Worth watching!"
