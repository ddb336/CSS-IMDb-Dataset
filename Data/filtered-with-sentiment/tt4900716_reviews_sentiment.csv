" You have to watch this!
",0.0,0.836,2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"This was in my watchlist since so long. However, I must say I was disappointed that I couldn't watch it earlier. I simply liked how the story is interwoven and so connected to each character. I was my first time watching Fawad. He has acted brilliantly in this movie. Overall this is a gem of a movie. I'm definitely going to recommend people to watch this."
" Finally Bollywood has had an upgrade
",0.0,0.8335,2021-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Have seen some really scathing reviews here on how this film is boring, I guess they have bland personalities and need the suspense of Salman Khan riding his motorbike through flames to be entertained.
The film had beautiful scenery and the I have to say the acting was great too. They all had their part to play in this film and I salute them.
For me, a person who loves movies but haaates Bollywood and is roped into watching them with my partner, I found this to be a masterpiece and one that steps away from the horrific Bollywood movies (Kabir Singh) that have been released.
If you are one of those critics who have said the movies is boring then my friend..... Please stick to you Golmaal 3 and never speak to me at a parties!"
" Amazing plot and better acting
",0.7717,0.1655,2021-03-21 00:00:00,9,Actors did an amazing job to portray flawed but loveable characters. The tension was all there and visible and made sense. It has got to be top 10 hindi movies out there.
" Intelligent family drama
",0.4588,0.9726,2021-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Kapoor & Sons review :Take a short vacation to the scenic Coonoor to meet this ultimate dysfunctional family. Truly, every member of the Kapoor clan has his/her own dark secret to guard with insecurities abound. Welcome then to the Karan Johar version of 'Dil Dhadakne Do' (2015) meets 'Monsoon Wedding' (2001).Let me now have the priviledge of introducing you to each of the family members:Dadu Kapoor (Rishi Kapoor) : A naughty at 90 grandpa who has fun browsing Mandakini's 'Ram Teri Ganga Maili' (1985) videos on his ""i-papad"" and cheating his friends at a card game, Dadu is the eldest Kapoor who wants his family in a saath saath pose for a family pic.
Rishi Kapoor brilliantly transforms in to a nonagenarian with heavy prosthetics and right body language to deliver a memorable performance.Harsh Kapoor (Rajat Kapoor) : He's a father of two young sons cheating on his wife and going through a financial downside. Rajat Kapoor, a fine actor that he is, goes through the role effortlessly.Sunita Kapoor (Ratna Pathak) : She's the lady of the house and under severe emotional stress owing to her husbands suspected infidelity and her sons' sibling rivalry. Ratna Pathak is impressive as ever in a character which is slightly over the top and over reacts most of the time..Rahul Kapoor (Fawad Khan) : The achcha beta of the family, he's hot in looks and cool in attitude. Nursing a dark secret of his own, Rahul is the catalyst for most of the subplots in the Kapoor story. Fawad Khan has got in to the skin of his character and his is the real standout performance in the movie after Rishi Kapoor. Kudos!Arjun Kapoor (Siddharth Malhotra) : The punching bag and misunderstood guy in the family, Arjun has been unlucky professionally and trying hard to succeed. His life changes when he meets Tia. Siddharth Malhotra is earnest as Arjun displaying the right amount of restraint and vulnerability.Tia Mallik (Alia Bhatt) : She's the happy go lucky neighbour of Kapoor's who becomes a bone of contention between the two brothers. Alia Bhatt is pleasing on the eyes and does well whatever is expected out of her.Director Shakun Batra's second outing after 'Ek Main aur Ekk Tu' (2012) - a film I loved tremondously but didn't get its due, is a cleverly packaged family drama which should strike a chord with the urban classes. Relying more on performances than the script, Kapoor & Sons is a likeable fare. Try it once.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
" Really exceptional
",0.0,0.9061,2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,This is one the best film that hits your heart a all-rounder movie all emotions are mixed really well in this movie acting is good overall a nice movie
" Family movie with humor and great acting
",0.7351,0.9426,2020-09-24 00:00:00,8,"Every single person in this movie is an amazing actor except for Alia. More on that later. This is a family movie - think Six Feet Under, Bloodline, etc. Very well made, Rishi Kapoor is charming and funny, the couple is so normal with their fighting, the sons do an amazing job. A must-watch. The movie is fun too. The only issue was Alia Bhatt. Her poutines, bubbly nature, and overall demeanor scream over-acting and are very exaggerated and annoying. She doesn't know how to act and in this amazing cast she brings down the movie, I cringe every time she is onscreen."
" family drama!!
",0.0,0.897,2020-09-20 00:00:00,5,It would be more interesting if they did not cast Alia Bhatt. Though I didn't like it very much. Again I didn't dislike it. Average watching film. nothing much to say about.Rajat Kapoor and Ratna Pathak were brilliant in playing their roles. Rishi Kapoor also quite good enough. Again I said that it was an average watchable film for me.
" Superb story backed by tremendous performances
",0.6369,0.9756,2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,"Wow what a movie! Love how well the movie slowly reflects how the family tries to be happy but in reality it's a completely broken one. Everyone is trying to put up a good show but truly everyone is lying. It such a natural movie, in real life, there are many lives and families who are actually completely broken but seem to be the perfect happy family.And now getting to the performances. For me the star performers were Rishi Kapoor, Ratna Pathak and Fawad Khan. Their display of characters and emotions is exemplary and a assurance of the stardom they really have achieved to date. Alia, Siddharth Malthotra and Rajat Kapoor also ace their roles. And ofcourse, Fawad, Alia and Siddharth look great too.Good work by Karan Johar and Dharma after a long time."
" Underrated AF
",0.0,0.9313,2020-09-09 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best and underrated movie. So many lessons here. Realistic for middle class people. Loved everyone's performances. Loved musics, cinematography, choreography, acting, direction, locations. Worth to watch. Feel it."
" Worst movie
",-0.6249,0.2805,2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,"Dunno why people just see alia and start giving 7 star etc crap
Movie don't waste your time"
" Worthwhile it is, 'Kapoor and Sons'
",0.34,0.9776,2020-07-14 00:00:00,9,"It is a considerable story but it has some 'wow' moments because of some senior actors like 'Rishi Kapoor, Ratna Pathak and Rajat Kapoor'. Fantastic performances by these three actors. The situational drama has many tiny elements that add up to the rating of this film. Watching Fawad Khan was another delight in this film. I would say, Fawad khan was way better than Siddarth Kapoor in this film. Very well written and executed by everyone. Exceptional casting. Definitely a unprecedented one."
" Punjabi family drama at southern india

" Perfect family drama
",0.5719,0.802,2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"Rishi kapoor nailed it and in all way this movie is about rishi kapoor. Modern day family drama with fun, tragedy, love, emotion. Screenplay, scripting, direction, everything 10 on 10. Great job with this one."

" Surrendering to the will to live?
",0.0,-0.9967,2020-05-02 00:00:00,9,"Maybe, like what Schopenhauer said, every life history is the history of suffering. Life has no intrinsic worth but is kept in motion loosely by desire and illusion. We hopelessly fall in love, to marry to do everything possible to become an object of disgust to each other. The 'will to live' for continuity of progeny has hijacked our will power. He further went on to say that our inborn error is to think that we exist to be happy. But at every turn, we soon realise the contradiction that the world and life have to offer. It seems that is why the face of the elderly intrinsically appear deeply frowned and depressed, realising the futility of life and death that will ensue.From the moment of the first cry, life is just a barrage of tests, tragedy and turmoil. We somehow are geniuses in creating troubles for ourselves. Rational people make rash decisions under the influence of emotion, giving intellect a rest. We think we are wiser with time and will not make the same mistake twice. Once bitten twice shy, we tell ourselves. But hell no! At the most crucial moment, our hormones and heart dominate over our intellect. Like Sisyphus, within the cycles of seeming joy of achievement and agony of defeat, we have to find contentment.Aristotle believed that the final goal of mankind is happiness, and this is achieved with virtue and knowledge. The Greek thought we needed tragedy in life, through art and culture, to remind us of the hopelessness of life. It is a catharsis of sorts for us to purify our minds and souls to understand truths about suffering, loss, misery, adversity, and redemption.This 2016 film is not the usual Bollywood fare. Done in a not so melodramatic fashion, it showcases the issues an average middle-class family encounters as the husband-and-wife couple is married too long to each other and their children have all grown up with a mind of their own. The husband and wife cannot stand the sight of each other. Their every action seems like an annoyance. Sometimes they ponder where love disappeared to. Trying to make the most politically correct response and trying to pacify warring factions between offspring proof stressful. Celebrations come and go. Everybody puts a brave front, putting fake smiles to display of portrait of happiness. Simmering beneath the cover are the frustrations, anger and disappointments of broken dreams just waiting to explode. The display of emotion does not always end in resolution. The end result can sometimes be quite devastating, and we wallow in melancholy. Hindsight vision is 20/20. We had seen it all along. We tell ourselves that we will be wiser the next around. But we will never learn, just waiting to plunge on head-on to the speeding trailer all over again."
" Gem of a movie.
",0.0,-0.3919,2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,Get ready to fall in love with this family. Adorable characters but each character has a flaw that binds you throughout. Don't watch it if you are bad at controlling your tears. This movie falls in the category of of 3 idiots and Jindagi na milegi dobara. Watch it with your family.
" Outstanding plot twists!
",0.6476,0.9742,2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"From the selection of cast to acting, amazing job done by everyone. The movie was portrayed so beautifully, Fawad Khan truly shines with his intense performance, just wish if he could get many roles in bollywood despite the India and Pakistan fued. Everyone did well and the twists were so unexpected. What a movie! Loved the pun on the end between Arjun and Rahul, to break the border between India and Pakistan for a picture together :)"

" Above average film
",0.0,0.7224,2019-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Kapoor and sons has great performances from fawad khan, rishi kapoor and ratna pathak shah. Though fawad and alia had just one scene, it was very cute. But the narration is very slow and making is strictly for urban audience. Plus sidharth malhotra's character was underdeveloped. On the whole its an okay one time watch."
" I loved this movie
",0.5994,0.1531,2019-09-27 00:00:00,9,Director heart touched movie. I end movie 5 hour before still I am in emotional I don't know what to say exceptional film.
" Best movie of 2016
",0.6369,0.9544,2019-09-23 00:00:00,10,"Very nice family film. Story was really good. Acting of Fawad Khan, Ratna Pathak, Rajat Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor were really good. Alia Bhatt and Sid we're sidelined by these great actors. Just one thing the gay thing was unnecessary in the film. I think it was KJo""s idea. It had nothing to do with the film. Lovely movie"

" Quite Impressive
",0.5563,0.67,2019-05-18 00:00:00,8,This film tries to hold a strong message for its viewers but also it went onto some unrealistic plot lines so as to strengthen the plot.
" a film of quaking emotional beauty
",0.4404,0.9519,2019-04-01 00:00:00,9,"Kapoor & Sons is a heart-throbbing dysfunctional family drama that screams emotions from every direction. Very genuine and sincere yet so relatable in the way it snares the very essence of family problems and the powerful themes of forgiveness and love. The cast were very powerful and astounding in delivering the demanding script to the audience. A movie that plays against expectations, Kapoor & Sons is Bollywood's new age family delight."
" A tale of Heartfelt Imperfections!!
",0.6229,0.9865,2019-02-08 00:00:00,9,"""Kapoor and Sons is a winner in its every core sense. The drama of a simple dysfunctional family is beautifully and carefully portrayed in the script.The Direction is very mature and the performances are top notch.
Rishi kapoor as Amarjeet kapoor , Rajat Kapoor as Harsh Kapoor and Ratna Pathak Shah as the lovely caring Mom form the backbone of this emotional drama. Fawad khan and Siddhartha play the roles of the complex sons beautifully. Alia Bhatt is like a fresh daisy in the movie. This movie will make u laugh and it will make u cry. And somewhere in the middle u will try to find yourself in the movie. One of the best family movies of this decade....."
" Brilliant
",0.5859,0.7722,2019-02-01 00:00:00,10,Kapoor and sons is one of the finest movies ever made in Bollywood. The director of the film shakun batra made it look more realistic. screenplay and cinematography are the heart of the film. You get totally involved in this movie .You fall in love with those characters that you feel quite uncomfortable to see them as real life people. If you have not watched this movie then you certainly are missing the best family drama ever seen.
" Beautiful Drama.
",0.5994,0.7703,2018-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Set in one of the most beautiful places in India ,Ooty,it tells the tale of a stubborn grandfather who wants to take a family picture with his entire family before he dies.Yet this simple task seems so impossible as things are not well between the participant of family picture.
The movie is filled with good humour .It is more real than many other movies I have seen in the same genre.Each one of cast is so phenomenal and captures us throughout the movie."
" boring conflicts, uncreative writing
",-0.5994,0.9627,2018-10-23 00:00:00,3,"While the subject matter and premise of this movie were great, the dialogue during the many conflict scenes was too simplistic to be moving, engaging or inspiring. It's easy to write a script when people walk away and don't communicate, or fight without talking, or refuse to listen instead of try to understand. The tension of the movie was created with the LACK of dialogue, so I was left wanting some creative poetic writing which is what I love so many Indian movies for. I was also not entertained by the wierd references to grandpa liking porn, and hanging a bra on sommeone's face on a first date, wierdly misplaced attempts to be daring or edgy?"
" it will stir your emotions...
",0.0,0.8016,2018-09-29 00:00:00,9,"After such a long time, I have seen such a gripping drama movie. Drama is such a genre that it becomes very difficult to grip the audience. You don't want them to yawn in Cinema halls. Kapoor and Sons, delivers such an amazing script along with extraordinary acting of all the actors. The movie is about a family and their internal issues, but it is more than that. It is a message that will really stir your emotions from inside. One of the best drama movie of all the time."
" Will be a classic!
",0.0,0.7836,2018-07-07 00:00:00,10,I've been a fan of Hindi movies for 50 years and this one will surely become a classic! Very well done.
" I wasn't expecting this
",0.0,0.9389,2018-06-15 00:00:00,9,"First of all let my just clap my hands and says.. WOW!I thought it was going to be one of those new bad Indian movies that promote liberalism and westernization without really delivering any artistic materials.. MAN I WAS WRONG!This general idea of the movie was great, the dialogues are rememberable and quoteable, some of the scenes were so damn good and emotional, the acting had its ups and downs but hey.. there's no such thing as a perfect movie anyway.I would recommend it to anyone and I might just rewatch it again.. it was THAT GOOD!"
" RisquÃ© Family Drama Tackling Current Issues
",0.0,0.9972,2017-11-05 00:00:00,8,"The Plot:- Rishi Kapoor as the granddad, a playful old man, a practical joker (I find annoying and silly but excusable as its more about the drama) has a heart attack. His son and daughter in-law rush him to the hospital. His grandsons, one in London and the other in New Jersey were informed so they both head for Coimbature, where the drama slowly unfolds. The granddad has a childish sense of humor, which is more realistic than the soapy tears and sentimental dialogues. The parents and sons bring the fun in dysfunctional. Constantly bickering. Not much at first but after spending a few minutes together tensions are brought to the surface. Favoritism and sibling rivalry is addressed. The Arjun character taking the brunt of the unfair victimization leaves to blow off some steam. Tia played by Alia Bhatt is another joker in this film, great character but with just a couple of tiny part-faults, part boons: 1. The actor herself, I find her really annoying, do not get me wrong she has potential and chooses good roles but she's not funny. 2. She redefines gender roles which is a good thing but she's the dominating character in every role and at the same time sweet and innocent and helpless. My feelings for her is complicated lets leave it at that. Please pass the cheese as we have a girl who comes in between two brothers. Well that was what I thought at first when Tia and Arjun were supposed to kiss thanks to the clichÃ©d spin the bottle premise. It was interrupted. Rahul looking to buy some property also finds Tia. Tia in her drunkedness kisses Rahul. Note that she did all the kissing as it will come back later. Arjun reveals to Tia about his writing aspirations and how his brother's novel seemed to have similar characters and subplots to his first draft. Tia on her birthday reveals about her parents tragic death and her last words to them. They died on their birthday. It is not love at first sight thank god but a slow and realistically blossoming romance between the two which gives it depth. Rahul crashes his dad's car. His dad was about to blame Arjun for it when Rahul steps forward and takes responsibility. The father later gave the impression that he was at the garage getting the car serviced.Climax: Skip this part if you haven't watched the movie. When granddad is discharged from the hospital a welcome party was initiated. Sunitha the mother or jealous wife in this case makes a scene when her husbands female colleague shows up, party cancelled. Rahul explains that he invited said person and generally takes his father's side on this matter. Tia said she had to tell Rahul something, you know what that means? Meanwhile Sunitha was going through Rahul's PC. Rahul and his uncle were traveling in a car when Rahul seeing something suspicious gets out of the car and sends his uncle away. He goes to investigate. What he saw was his father's car with that dent in it from the crash earlier, in the driveway of the woman Sunitha suspects her husband of having an affair with. The infidelity is true as it turns out. Also Sunithaji aap ka beta gay hai=Sunitha ma'am your son is gay. Sunitha confronts Rahul about his homosexuality which by the way hats of to the director who understands that the typical gay stereotype is just that, a stereotype and a gay guy or girl may in fact just behave normally. In the argument it just slips from Rahul about his father's infidelity issue. The granddad's wish about taking a family picture is explored. An argument breaks out instead. Husband and wife argue over the infidelity, siblings argue over Tia and Rahul kissing Tia when it was Tia who initiated it but she's not Rahul's type and the idea stealing as well is not what it seems. The father drives of and Sunitha was calling his cell. He picks up but a truck collides with his car and he dies and the last exchange with the family was a negative one. Sunitha finally reveals to Arjun that she gave Rahul, Arjun's book idea. Arjun came out of the closet officially. A bittersweet ending unlike the redundant happily ever after.Content: Relevant and interesting for me but two cringe-worthy scenes or discussions rather. 1.Would you eat poop for money 2. Granddad and grandsons talking about smut. A mention of cartoon porn, hentai anyone. 3. Granddad explains that he saw Ram Teri Ganga Mailli 14 times for the scene where Mandakini getting wet in a white sari by the waterfall. The joke returns later on with Arjun bringing a life size poster of Mandakini in the white wet sari. Furthermore a life size poster of the deceased father for the family picture adds to the bittersweet ending as an inside joke so this one is kind of okay. A cool scene I liked, granddad and grandsons sharing a joint. Don't do drugs however folks.In conclusion a good movie overall for the drama genre."
" An ensemble of stellar performances to create magic!
",0.3382,0.9524,2017-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Kapoor & Sons came as a surprise to me where I expected it to be a usual Bollywood melodrama. But, this one turned out to be a great plot with sincere performances.This is the movie that separates itself as a family drama from family melodramas.Special mention for Ratna Pathak Shah outperforms every one else and delivers a great deal of on-screen command.Sublime plot, no melodramatic dialogues, no over-the-top twists.Kapoor and Sons is pure, emotional piece or art. A movie to cherish forever."
" A Family drama with a twist !!
",0.0,0.9942,2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"The movie is about a dysfunctional Indian family ... the fights , misunderstandings ,complicated relationships .... something which most of us as Indians can easily relate to.The story primarily focuses on two brothers ,Fawad khan , a successful writer living in UK and Siddharth Malhotra, also a wannabe writer still trying to find his feet in the US . It also deals with the lives of their parents Rajat Kapur and Ratna Pathak shah who are trying to get their married life back on track. Not to forget ... the tharki buddha ... Rishi Kapoor as the grandfather, in an awesome role which really invokes spontaneous laughter with his witty one liners. the old one is as horny as a teenager with raging hormones. .. trying to smoke pot on the sly, watch porn on his I-papad (I-pad ) ,making cheesy comments abt the nurses in the hospital and what not . But he is also a lovable old guy who wants to keep the family together and have a happy family pic with all of them ... and hence the title .Complications occur with the entry of Alia Bhatt ( who does not have much of a role ) ..... she first falls for the ""maa ka accha baccha"" Fawad and then realizes that she gets along better with the rebellious Sid ... this causes a lot of complications in the brothers lives .... how they sort out things forms the rest of the story.The first half is light with lots of funny moments mainly due to Rishi Kapoor and his amazing potty ,porn and pyt (pretty young things) jokes. . The second half is more serious .. Rona Dhona ... melodrama and a few twist as the climax unfolds . Remember it is a Karan Johar film ........ and there is someone who is not who he seems to be ... wont tell who thou( spoiler alert!!!) smile emoticon:)All the members of the cast have acted well.""Ladki beautiful "" is quite catchy and will definitely appeal to the young crowd .. nothing much to say abt the music otherwise. Direction is okay .My rating : 3 Stars ( ***). I recommend watching the movie primarily for the 1st half and Rishi Kapoor's acting which really makes it worth every penny spent."
" Not every family is happy,but that doesn't mean it isn't a family
",0.0,0.9933,2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"A Grumpy Ole Bollywood story showing happy families starting on a positive note, followed by a tragedy being finally resolved in the climax is so prevalent since generations that we believe this is the story of every Indian family, the irony being: this is the story of every other family, not ours.Shakun Batra's Kapoor & Sons Since 1921 kills this myth and tells the story that is more ours than anyone else's. Kapoor & Sons is a story of a dysfunctional family living in the hills of Coonoor. A financially struggling Harsh Kapoor(Rajat Kapoor) living in a house with an unhappy wife Sunita(Ratna Pathak Shah) and heart patient but larger-than- life father(Rishi Kapoor) whose last wish is to have a full family photo being framed before his death.Harsh and Sunita have two sons: Rahul(Fawad Khan), the elder and perfect son who is a successful writer settled in UK and Arjun(Siddharth Malhotra), the younger son struggling on his own novel and surviving by doing different jobs in the States.Both Rahul and Arjun arrive home after learning that their Dadu has suffered from a cardiac arrest. This is where they both meet and become involved with the same girl Tia(Alia Bhatt), a freelancer taking care of an ancient property in the town and looking to sell it.The movie moves at a subtle pace giving us some beautiful and light moments until a moment when a web of secrets slowly start to unravel including a lie that threatens to tear the family apart. It gives you a feel-good vibe while keeping you attached with every character all through and giving a healthy dose of laughter induced frequently by the modern-age porn-loving Dadu and his antics.The performances of the whole cast are admirable. Rajat Kapoor as a man under the pressure of obligation to his family but unappreciated for his efforts is excellent. Ratna Pathak Shah as a faithful wife living in a burdened marriage and a proud mother is exemplary. Rishi Kapoor with his sarcastic one-liners is lovable. His interactions with his grandsons regarding porn is a treat to watch. Alia Bhatt is bubbly and beautiful at the same time. Siddarth Malhotra is the weakest link in the movie unable to transform himself from a cheated yet moved-on teenager to a distraught adult is unconvincing. But it is Fawad Khan who delivers a masterclass and holds the movie together as Rahul, the not-so-perfect son showing why he is a celebrated actor in Pakistan. Sukant Goel as Wasim also deserves a mention.The only flaw in the movie is the unraveling of the mysteries that you are confused, who is to blame and who is to be sympathized.All in all a decent byproduct by Shakun Batra who after his 'Ekk Main Aur Ekk Tu' has made a mark with his mature narratives. The movie delivers a beautiful message that even if there are problems, one should never abandon his family."
