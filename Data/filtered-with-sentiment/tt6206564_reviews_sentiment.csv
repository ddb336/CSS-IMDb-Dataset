" OMG the dumbness really hurts
",-0.7425,-0.4404,2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,"These days Bollywood just produces literally anything, and thinking us public all stupid, and yes whose who have rated this movie more than 5 stars are really standed up to the over smart Vikramaditya Motwane's (Director) expectations, really this is a proof of how dumb, manipulative we Indians are, really we need to stand and speak up against these dumb creations of Vikramaditya Motwane's like shameless directors."
" Home alone in the city - the dramatic version
",-0.25,0.9869,2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Trapped is an entertaining thriller/survival drama, and a great critical commentary on life in the big city, how lonely it could be even when it's full of people, how self-centred people can be, totally unaware of their surroundings. This is where our hero is stuck, on the high floor of one of Mumbai's uninhabited apartment skyscrapers. He gets to live there temporarily and jumps on the opportunity to pay minimal rent. But soon enough he gets locked in the apartment, without electricity and ability to contact anyone. The film's premise sounds rather peculiar at first, how would anyone get locked inside an apartment? But once the film is on, everything fits perfectly into the story in what turns out to be a realistic and very grippingly convincing film. The film is not perfect, and it does strain credulity on several occasions, but it's forgivable. It goes without saying that nothing would work if not for Rajkummar Rao's excellent performance. Being a sole player is a great challenge for any actor, and Rao rises to the occasion. Rao is the film, he is the story, he is the script, and he is everything Trapped is. The other star is of course director Vikramaditya Motwane, who directs this feature with heart and soul, and makes it much more than just another survival story. Kudos to him for successfully conveying his important social message and keeping the audience on the edge of their seats through this entertaining and highly captivating film."

",0.4404,0.9568,2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,The first half of the movie is no doubt slow but probably that is necessary so that the audience can properly sense the thrill in the later half. The plot is good too but the best thing the movie has to offer is the amazing performance by Rajkumar Rao.

Rajkumar Rao is stellar in his performance and its his one-man show that wins us throughout the film. The film at times makes you feel like you are actually with Rao in that house and can feel his desperation. Even the last scene is full of anxious moments. Outstanding film and one of Bollywood's finest films ever made. Show such films as much love as possible for these are the films that deserve our appreciation!

" Urban entrapment
",0.0,-0.34,2019-11-27 00:00:00,9,"Symbolic of our urban entrapment wherein we are caught in an eternal struggle for survival.The notion of 'deficiency in the midst of plenty' is depicted here through the predicament of the protagonist who is trapped in a high-rise building in the middle of a concrete jungle, even as he battles depleting resources and pests, just to survive.Rao, as is expected of him, excels in what is essentially a solo character tale, akin to Tom Hanks' in 'Cast Away'.Gritty and engaging."
" The survival instinct
",0.0,-0.5994,2019-11-15 00:00:00,7,This movie correctly depicts the survival instinct that is embedded in humans. The movie starts with the main character falling in love with a girl and eventually ending up in a relationship. The movie takes a swift turn when the protagonist searches for a home and ends up trapped in one. The rest of the movie deals with how the protagonist deals with complications and the extreme things he does to avoid negative consequences.
" fight to survive
",-0.3818,-0.9267,2019-10-11 00:00:00,10,"A man is trapped in a desolate building and how he deals with the situation makes the story. It should be as simple as that, but it isn't as simple as it looks. The real narrative is much more than this.Trapped is a movie whose director is the same who directed the epic movie Lootera & Udaan. Vikramaditya Motwane has chosen the ideal character Rajkummar Rao as the protagonist of the movie which was released in 17th Mar'17 and gathered rave reviews across the world.Saurya (Rajkummar Rao) is in love with Noorie(Geetanjali Thapa) whose wedding is already fixed. So they plan to run away and get married. Since Saurya lives in a bachelor's hostel, he plans to take a flat where he can stay with Noorie. In a hurry to find an inexpensive accommodation, he shifts to a newly built high-rise which has some legal issues and hence has remained desolate. The security guard of the building is oblivious of his shifting to the building and even Noorie has no idea of his new address. Next morning while getting late to office, Saurya inadvertently locks himself inside the apartment with the key hanging outside the door. Few attempts to open the door fails and since the building has no electrical connection, his phone conks of and he is totally disconnected from outer world. But he doesn't want to give up. The zeal to live drives his enthusiasm to think out of the box from among those normal household items in the house. He makes posters for help from cardboard and toothpaste and throws them out for somebody to notice. He puts his clothes on fire in the night for people to notice. But no one did really, his voice doesn't reach people more than 100 feet below, his posters doesn't reach the right place.With no food, water or electricity, it is a fight for unrelenting survival for Saurya. With passing days, he becomes claustrophobic and with nothing to eat, he starts surviving on cockroaches, ants, and pigeons and started talking to the lone rat in the house. One fine day, as a respite it rains heavily and he collected as much water as he can in all empty containers in the house and survives on them for some time. But with passing time, his psychological and physical health deteriorates.As a last option, he starts cutting the balcony window with a metal sheet that he found in the house and after days of cutting he finally succeeds. He climbs down through the windows for next five floors where he finds a balcony with no gates or doors and enters the floor to climb down the stairs and escapes the building. A few steps away from the building he faints due to weakness and is rushed to the hospital by locals. The story ends with some twists and turns. Whether the struggle he went through to come out of the house was worth? How do the people around him react?Vikramditya Motwane has the absolute brilliance to turn a one line story into a 105 minute tour de force. The one man army Rajkumar Rao makes the movie run on his own shoulder with his despair to escape from the flat and show his ordeal so effortlessly. It takes nerve to sit through the 105 minutes of the movie living with his hallucination. You will feel sorry for him when you see his hunger is turning him into a beast and a completely Vegan guy doesn't hesitate to eat pigeons. You will feel a part of yourself along with the plot when with each sunset you get impatient along with him, how you feel imprisoned in the flat along with him. Not just inside the flat where he was stuck, but was fighting many demons with the outside world too. Like numerous people staying in Mumbai, he was fighting a battle to marry his girlfriend with his hand to mouth income.The director has taken very little things into accountability too. The 35+ floor apartment's name is Swarg where the protagonist is stuck for more than a week. The very minute details have been taken care of when Saurya walks out of home and the guard gives him the typical look that those in Mumbai would give to any stranger.Coming out of the theater if you stop by a roadside eatery to have something, I am sure you will remember Saurya. You will know his vulnerability; but you will never understand how he survived unless you have the kind of guts and survival instinct in yourself. You need tonnes of courage to watch this movie. As for me, this is the best survival thriller I have watched yet. Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted are the most terrible poverty and scariest experience ever. When you come out of the theatre, am sure you will feel a part of your soul left inside the theatre."
" Acting! And thrilling
",0.5255,0.2732,2019-09-08 00:00:00,8,One of the finest acting job by rajkumar rao and well written
" Worth dealing with subtitles
",0.2263,0.9077,2019-08-08 00:00:00,8,"Very well written, and very well acted. It's well worth having to deal with the subtitles. I certainly hope they intend to develop a season three."
" An epic tale of fighting with the odds!
",-0.4199,0.8173,2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,"If you want to see a movie, which gives you the feel of how one can fight against his/her odds, then it's a must watch for you!
This movie really helps you think how you can be optimistic in the very miserable conditions too. This movie is a story of a middle class working guy Shaurya (Rajkumar Rao) who falls in love with her colleague Noorie (Gitanjali Thapa) and promises to marry her. So he rents an apartment so that both of them can shift there after their marriage. This flat fits in his budget but, it is in a building where no one has lived since two years. When Shaurya plans to go marry Noorie and leaves his flat, he somehow gets locked in his own flat. And this is where the tragic things start happening. He is locked in a flat where no one lives and he is at a higher flat from where no one cam be approached. Will he ever get out if this trap or he has to end up there?
This movie is an epic tale of a trapped person. It really feels like the Indian Bear Grills episode with a lot of emotions. Fear of not dieing alone makes a person do really great things which he/she never has done.
Pace of this movie is slow, dialogues are very less, so you need to be a bit patient while watching it. But it's really a worth watch. Rajkumar Rao shines throughout the movie by his praiseworthy performance. Geetanjali Thapa is nice for her small role! Direction is quite good. Do watch this movie to get something unique story."
" Story + acting + screenplay = great movie.
",0.6249,0.5719,2019-06-02 00:00:00,9,Trapped has it's significance with it's Title. The genre of the movie is survival. Rajkumar Rao nails with his acting skills he was on point with all the expression and the looks. The direction and the screenplay was on point. Every minute detail of person during the situation has been covered well in the movie and even executed with brilliance by Rajkumar Rao. It's a must watch by Rao.

To portray this survival thriller to the best of his abilities, he only ate carrots and coffee and drank as little water as possible.This movie is as gripping as Castaway, but is also positively depressing as it takes place in the heart of a busy, bustling neighbourhood in Mumbai."

" Bollywood adoption of Cast Away
",0.0,0.5859,2018-10-26 00:00:00,5,"Although it's a Bollywood adoption of Cast Away , the cult classic , there are few flaws which cannot make this film closer to the masterpiece. RajKummar Rao did 100% justice to the role, no doubt about it ."
" Executed with perfection - A genre tried for the first time in Bollywood
",0.5719,0.837,2018-10-05 00:00:00,9,"We already have a lot of Hollywood movie in this genre. A struggle for survival against all odds have been already captured in some Hollywood flicks such as 127 hours, Survival Island among others. This is the first any one has made a movie in this genre in Bollywood and believe me it is an awesome start for Bollywood.
Trapped is a story of young man who gets trapped in newly made apartment with no food, electricity and water. it is very necessary to keep movies like Trapped short and crisp otherwise the sequence and scenes will give a feeling of repeatedness and the chance of audience getting bored will increase. 105 mins of run time is apt for the movie and all the struggle for survival sequences captured by the director seems quite legit and natural.This movie has not been possible without Rajkumar Rao. He has given his blood and soul to this character. All the efforts put by his character to get out of the apartment looked believable and it is a big win for Rajkumar Rao as an actor.
May be Vikramaditya Motwane has taken the inspiration of this movie fron the west but the character and setting he has used are very Indian. Rajkumar Rao as Shaurya has played the character of a middle class boy with middle class aspirations. The struggle for survival are quite original and looks genuine.But the only problem is that Indian audience are still not ready for this kind of movie. Made on a very small budget of 5 crore, the movie didn't even manage to cover its cost through theatrical revenue Go and watch this movie and celebrate effort and courage of Vikramaditya Motwane"

As for how, well its a well furnished apartment, and he already have those pliers type thing. Screws/nails can be obtained form wall-sockets/electrical devices/furniture. He also has fire, if the door is flammable, or if hinges do not come out easily. Barely takes 10-20 minutes to open the damn thing. Probably didn't took a single class in college he went to.

" NO Logic and very dumb story
",-0.7598,-0.8457,2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"I have some points
1. very dumb personality & over acting missing act for body changes
2. not using proper tools, stupid fear like mouse & nonvage food
3. maximum time character using torch but not using torch battery for mobile phone charging or start 
4. no one help for bloody msgs & character not understand time morning noon and night for different act
5. if you have any question like how to make nonsense movies ....so watch this movie!"
" One of the greatest stupid movies.
",0.2023,-0.9674,2018-05-11 00:00:00,1,"Ever heard of a Wooden door. Yes door made by wood. Wood which catches fire. well this is a movie about a wooden door and about how to act deliberately stupid. There are a few movies as stupid as this one. This one is also about a stupid guy overacted by Rajkumar Rao in which Just to add cringe factor the director creates some stupid scenes like eating cockroaches and pigeons and drinking piss.Either the director thought the audience is stupid (which I think is true since 90% reviewers here gave this stupid movie 8 stars or more and even compared it with cast away) or he had nothing better to make. The character burns and breaks just about everything in the apartment to get out, when all he had to do was burn a wooden door.A very stupid movie made by a very stupid director."
" 2 major flaws in direction: The fire and the leather belt.
",-0.34,0.7377,2018-04-03 00:00:00,7,"Otherwise a very well directed survival movie, with very limited characters but i found it very dumb for a trapped person to have the easy access to create fire and yet he burns his clothes and mattress instead of the wooden door. He could have easily burnt a small portion of the door and then break his way out rather than cutting the steel grill. WOOD vs STEEL ??And secondly, i feel all of the leather belts that we men wear have their buckle end riveted with either one or maximum 2 rivets. If you see the shot where he tries to use his own belt while dangling on the 31st floor grill, and then loops the belt around the bottom last rod of the grill, HE PASSES THE BELT ONLY THROUGH THE BUCKLE LOOP & DOES'NT TIE A KNOT !! Which means the weight of his whole body for those few seconds when he dangles to keep his feet steady on the grill of the 30th floor, is held up BY JUST ONE SINGLE RIVET !! Any belt would have given away at that particular point unless you tie knot around the rod.But overall a must watch and well directed movie and some great acting skills by Rajkumar Rao."

" Trapped Review
",-0.5267,0.9629,2017-10-20 00:00:00,7,"Trapped is a film directed by Vikramaditya Motwane. I had heard many praises for this film. Now considering that this film is made by the man behind Udaan, I thought that this will be a masterpiece. But I would say that it's not.Plot: Shaurya gets trapped in his own home without and food, water or electricity.Story and direction: The film gives us an insight into the life of Shaurya who works in a travel office who is an introvert. The way he extends friendship to his girlfriend was some what very nice. And we see that no one gives basically a s*** as to what he is doing. Like he leaves his home, his PG friends don't even bother to ask as to why he is leaving. The we get to the main plot of the film where Shaurya gets trapped. The film here basically presents quite an unrealistic situation. We basically have no one in the building, a watchman who doesn't give a s***. a house without electricity, etc. But the struggles shown were quite real. You could connect with Shaurya. That's basically what you want from a film, to connect with your protagonist, and from that point of view the film delivers. Then we have the ending where you feel nothing has changed. In films, you basically have an arc where a character is in different places during the beginning and end of the film. But I was very disappointed of the arc not being present.Performances: Rajkumar Rao was the star of this film. I cared for him in the entire film. He delivered a great performance. No wonder he is a National Award Winner. Geetanjali Thapa was also good for the kind of role she got.Now since any scene didn't wow me that much, I didn't have a favorite scene in this film.Verdict: Not one of Motwane's best, but considering the budget in which it was made he did quite a satisfactory job. If not for anything do watch this film for Rajkumar Rao. He kills it.I am going with a 7/10."
" Rajkumar Rao is the next big thing- our under dog hero !

Sense of relativity strikes perpetually and you start sharing their moments of emotions like successes and failures. To me this actor is Rajkumar rao . #Trapped left me with a sense of pride to have seen him grow as an actor since LSD. #Shahid #Newton are the nuggets to cherish for decades to come, I am sure #Omerta would be a delightful watch too . India has found its very own Daniel Day-Lewis with simmering layers of excellence, standing on the cusp of becoming a legend. Its exhilarating to see him climbing the ladder of success in today's shallow showbiz, where the number of social media followers decide the popularity of the celebrity. #Bravo"
" Trapped Review: A refreshing and captivating survival saga.
",-0.5267,0.923,2017-10-17 00:00:00,9,"Movie: Trapped (UA)Rating: 4.5/5It's hard to find movies of this excellence in Bollywood nowadays. This film keeps the hope alive that there are filmmakers who are here to create a difference. And luckily this film creates a difference: watch it and you'll be TRAPPED in the enchanting screenplay along with the protagonist. Such great is the execution and direction by Vikramaditya Motwane.TRAPPED relies on the scintillating thrills as well as a glowing performance from Rajkummar Rao. His expressions in multiple sequences are a treat to watch. Since the rest of the cast has nothing much special to do as compared to him, it can be said that they did a comfortable job as per the demand by the script.The editing of the film is excellent, as the film never goes too long and doesn't bore as well. The screenplay is woven extremely well and after a time you feel like being a part of the protagonist's struggle. The film starts well, moves ahead further even better, then goes on the right track (rather keeps going on) and leads to an unexpected climax. There's a lot of action (not fighting) which is absolutely spectacular and enjoyable.The film raises some debatable questions as well. The dialogues are another major strength whenever they appear as they reflect the mood of the characters and eventually, the film very well.The film didn't need any songs, and even the one song it had didn't seem to needed in the film. Nevertheless, mostly everything works in the film.As a survival thriller/action drama, TRAPPED will totally engage you once you start watching it. There are many moments which will be difficult to watch but then, ask yourself a question: is watching this more difficult than watching it when it happens in reality?"
" Gem. Bollywood is reaching places
",0.2023,0.9597,2017-10-09 00:00:00,10,These kind of movies make me a bollywood fan. Trapped is an original concept that has been made so well. A Thrilling performance by Rajkummar Rao. Vikramaditya Motwane is a brilliant director. The screenplay / script/ editing is fantastic. The movie moves at a brisk pace and at the same time the feeling sinks in slowly that there will be rescue for the Protagonist. This is real horror. It is amazing
" Trapped with Rajkumaar Rao.!
",-0.5707,0.8834,2017-10-01 00:00:00,8,"The film is very different genre of thriller its not your typical b- wood movie with murder story its more on realistic film the film explores the psychological chaos, the theme of film is very simple as you get the basic story about film by trailers and title , Rajkumar rao plays the character shaurya and he did his wonderful job as always, The full film is on Rajukumar's shoulder the film also explore many basic survival questions and psychological effect such as backfire effect and also bring back some basic of surviving techniques like (spoilers) when the phone battery dies rajkumar rao try to rub an battery on his jeans it gives the perfect example how desprete we can be and how our mind acts as such problem. The movie is not for you if you are looking for perfect story with satisfying ending you gonna get disappointed as i said this is not for you if you are in typical Bollywood movies with songs and dance number, i like this film and also like to see our Bollywood is exploring new themes and stories."

He had equipments to burn, he even burnt his mattress and sofa near his window to show people that he is trapped. Leaving that thing, RajKumar Rao has done fabulous job, the story is so realistic and you can really feel the movie at your own side."

" Trapped:Loneliness in the Middle of City
",0.0,-0.9327,2017-08-05 00:00:00,9,"Trapped is the story of a man who becomes locked in his flat hundreds of feet above the bustling metropolis of Mumbai with no one to save him or even miss him. film explores the nature of loneliness and the fact that it doesn't matter how many people you are surrounded by, you can still disappear very easily. Trapped is a film about the terrors of urban isolation, how a man standing in the 35th floor flat in the middle of a city of millions can be completely alone. Rao has no one to rely on for help apart from himself, it's a theme that is driven home on numerous occasions through the film. When he exhausts his attempts to contact the outside world, he is forced to look inside to find out who he really is, whether or not he survives this event is entirely up to him, and it forces his to confront not only his own fears, but also to reconsider everything about himself. Trapped is a film about the way that kind of isolation is entirely a matter of mindset rather than simply circumstances. Yes, Shaurya is trapped in this flat, but he learns more about himself and what his life really means to him in that time frame alone than he does working his day to day job on the outside. Rajkummar Rao obviously has to do a lot of heavy lifting as he is the only on screen character for almost a full movie which i don't believe many others actors can achieve. Trapped is one of the best Indian films of the year so far Thanks to the excellent performance of Rajkummar Rao and the way movie is directed and clears all the silly things and doubts which occurred during premise."

I have come to expect not very intelligent and sensible movies from Bollywood. But this one takes the cake as such a thrilling and scary movie that made me squirm as though you might be watching a ghost coming right out of the screen. But, this is far away from ghosts and spirits that is precisely the reason why it is so scary - it is sooooo real. What will you do when you are trapped inside a locked apartment with no electricity, food and water. Your phone's battery is dead and you are at the top most floor in an high rise apartment building that is completely unoccupied and thus there is no one to listen to your cries of help. You have to somehow survive and the get the hell out of there before you starve to your death. This is the Bollywood version of Castaway. Rajkumar Rao has acted brilliantly as the one being trapped and at every point you are going along with his character feeling what he feels. Truly worth every minute watching this."

I wanted to watch this movie on the big screen but it had only one show in only 1 multiplex out of 10 multiplex and due to its odd timings I was not able to watch."
" character is unentertainingly stupid

" Funny rather than peeking curiosity
",0.4404,-0.8294,2017-06-13 00:00:00,3,Raj Kumar's acting has become so monotonous you will see him confused and stammering in all his films. I really liked him in Kai po che and shahid but this is his worst performance. The storyline is so predictable and does not convey the message intended clearly. Too many flaws and him being trapped in the apartment looks so unbelievable and fake. Raj Kumar's acting somehow turns funny.
" Holes are Trapped in This Movie
",-0.5267,-0.8782,2017-06-08 00:00:00,1,"I see, the ratings are good, reviews are positive in IMDb. Though expectation does not try to touch sky as the Director, Actor are not so popular. But I expect a good one and recommend to some of my friends. Afterward, I regret, why do I invited/recommended them to watch this movie. Now I can suppose the positive reviews are all fake. The trapped man can be released from the trapped situation easily as the youngest child suggesting some smarter idea then the Director showing us. Many of ideas are available for anyone general. But the Director though may the audience are fool that what ideas I would show them the audience will swallow. Bad Idea! Rajkummar Rao can't shine by his poor performance. Kai Po Che was best indeed. However, a small rubber stretch into taller until 1h 45m but failed to grab an audience till the end."
" Can be compared with the great 'Cast Away' in an urban plot
",0.6249,0.9437,2017-06-02 00:00:00,8,"Assuming you to know the plot (a young man accidentally locked in a semi-furnished 35th floor flat in a vacant multi-storied apartment in Mumbai, India without any communication, water, food, electricity. After surviving several days over there he managed to escape) it is a movie of non-main stream. Such movies are unique in nature for Bollywood. And even if you know the full story, you still enjoy the thrill of watching it.While watching it, the movie can remind you of the great surviving story shown in 'Cast Away'. Plot of 'Cast Away' was a deserted island whereas for 'Trapped' it is in the middle of a metro City. One point the director made in good way by making the movie background music free in most of the time - that let you fell the loneliness of the character. It shows how one gave away his ideology when his survival in under question. Some scene might be disturbing to soft hearten spectators (Like drinking urine, eating bird meat etc.) Rajkumar Rao as an actor reached to to a excel level in this movie. Most of the movie are dialog less - but his expression and acting tells us everything. The expression are so bold and prominent, that you can read every word behind it."
" Height of excellence
",0.6249,0.9808,2017-06-01 00:00:00,9,"This is not a movie, if Bahubali, Sultan, PK are released as movie. This is an epic performance and directional duo. Every second is worth watching and definitely best in quality. @Raj Kumar Rao, what a performance! You are always honest to the character you play, though this time, it's mind-blowing. Wow just wow, the way you play such character. Hats off you.. @Vikramaditya Motwane, what an execution. The screen, the expression portray, every tit-bit is excellent."
" Good acting keeps it afloat
",0.4404,0.9856,2017-05-29 00:00:00,5,"We know what we are going to get into when watching the movie. It's not going to be the typical ""entertainer"" or ""Masala"" popcorn fare. It's for the discerning and viewer who likes to watch something different and gritty, similar to the so-called ""art"" movies of the yore. So, for the average viewer looking for kicks a minute entertainment, it is going to be ZERO rating. But, getting that out of the way, for the rest of the viewers, how does it work out? I liked the acting of RajKumar. Very nicely done. To carry an entire movie frame to frame and not interacting with anyone is a huge challenge. There was another similar movie called Phobia, whether the lady who did the role, overacted beyond tolerance. But, here, the acting was terrific and real and in fact carries a weak script to something believable. The photography aspect is another key element in such movies (any movie, but here it needs to take the viewer in to the proceedings without any crutch such as beautiful locales, or people or outdoors etc). And it is good here, without resorting to any fancy gimmicks. No weird angles, claustrophobic inducements or other fancy stuff. Minimal, but works well. I loved the previous movies of this director (Vikram M) and full credit to him to make something different from his previous fares. I gave it 5 stars, because i think the script was weak. It's possible to get locked in (i did), but somehow it feels convoluted that one can't escape for so long; and when he escapes it seems unreal, that he has the strength to trapeze like a tight rope artist down five balconies after starving for days."
" An intelligent survival-thriller delivered craftily by Motwane-Rajkummar
",0.4588,0.6329,2017-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Imagine yourself locked in a room with no food, water and electricity. Quite scary, isn't it? But with the ever-advancing technology and our ever increasing comforts, even imagining this situation is difficult. Vikramaditya Motwane's Trapped is one such perfectly cooked recipe.Set in the city of Mumbai, Trapped is the story of Shaurya(Rajkummar Rao) who gets stuck in an apartment deprived of all basic necessities and his fight in this adverse situation. Shaurya works in a call centre in Mumbai. A shy and inexpressive person, he falls for a co-worker Noorie(Geetanjali Thapa) and manages to impress her. They start a relationship but Noorie is about to be married. So when Shaurya proposes marriage to her, she asks him to find a suitable and affordable place where they could start their life. He manages to find one such flat from where the movie arrives on its plot.Trapped is Bolloywood's answer to the survival genre. There is no deserted island, no enemy forces, just a 2-BHK apartment in which Shaurya is cornered which might seem strange as there has not been this type of a popular movie. But this movie delivers nonchalantly. It is not exactly edge of the seat stuff or a roller-coaster ride but a product of sheer endurance of both Rao and Motwane. What enhances the reputation of this movie is that the little details have been carefully examined so one can't accuse the movie of casual mistakes or shortcomings. Although the concept may seem tacky to some, but believe me it's not.Performance-wise, its a one-man show. The movie rested largely on Rajkummar Rao's shoulders and how well has he delivered. While there is no question mark over his ability, such a movie can always creep doubts in one's mind. But sweeping aside all these doubts Rao has stamped his authority here. A product of FTII, Rao keeps enhancing his skill with every movie surpassing every challenge with ease. Its a shame that an actor like Rao still hasn't been accepted in the industry, but looking at his choice of movies we can say that the legend just keeps rising. National Award winner Geetanjali Thapa only has a few scenes and she seems convincing.Trapped by no means is a perfect movie. It has its flaws but is fresh, enjoyable and deserves acclaim. Motwane has come up with something totally contrasting than his last movies 'Udaan' and 'Lootera' and has done a tremendous job.The movie is funny, tense, thrilling and has given 'Jolly LLB 2' a run for being the movie of the year so far(which may soon be overtaken by the internationally acclaimed 'Newton', another Rajkummar Rao starrer). So.please go for Trapped, if you crave for intelligent cinema."
" Brilliance at Acting and Directing!

" India's answer to solo man survival genre.
",0.0,0.8166,2017-03-27 00:00:00,7,"Trapped as the name leads it is obliviously a survival flick. Rajkumar Rao as Shaurya who leads an average life of any single man working on a normal job routine. He rents an apartment in the 35th floor of a 40 something floor building. The hitch here is its is in the middle of the happening city yet deserted by itself or isolated from the people's world. So Rao takes us with him on his struggle ride when he gets himself locked in his flat on the first day he moved in. The next 80 mins in the movie are about how he fights for survival locked in without no water no electricity and no food. We see him struggle through psychic reactions, hallucinations, growing impatient, crying, growling losing hope. All the above said expressions perfectly convinced by Rajkumar Rao. What I particularly like about the movie is the end message as you take it is very subtle and up to you. It can be from what came to my mind 1. You can end up in a big hole if don't think logically and fall for cheaper options. 2. Even the minute careless negligence of an everyday action can put you in a big struggle for life. 3. My favorite one: there are still chances that you will be surrounded by hundred thousand people but nobody will hear you or see you though you are seeing and hearing them. It's like situations can camouflage your presence and makes you disappear.I wouldn't say this is a perfect survival flick it has its own flaws in it, you might feel it is depressing disturbing and not to the logic but still I would recommend it because compared to other films of the same genre like 127 hours or cast away or life of pi where the struggle situation happens in middle of nowhere. The point in this story it happens right in the middle of a populated area and yet he is isolated. Reference to no of days or the place (looks like Mumbai but was not explicit) could have added more of impact to the audience."

Don't get turned off by the language being Hindi because there is very little dialog and it's not integral to the plot.One question for the writers though, why didn't he check for dry walls between apartments. That would be the first thing I would do :)"
" Trapped Indeed
",-0.5267,-0.9761,2017-03-25 00:00:00,4,"Someone is indeed trapped in this movie and it is not the protagonist it's you. This is a movie about a young man trapped in his high-rise apartment and his ordeals as he tries to get everybody's attention to get him out of there instead of trying to do so himself. This is the first time I am seeing a survival movie coming out of Bollywood with entire movie being shot in just one location. Kudos to Rajkumar's acting but it is not him that makes the movie stupid it is the writers. I am from India and things that happened with our protagonist before he gets trapped in his apartment are not unreal. The building in which the entire movie takes place is indeed under construction at the time of filming and looks like the apartments are unoccupied. In India it is possible to rent an apartment like that even with the guard of the building not knowing someone is living there. There are also places in Mumbai where the apartment doors jam like that and requires a key to be unlocked from inside. So to this point everything checks out.Protagonist is a young man working in an office of some company which tells us he has not only received basic education but also some sort of higher education. Real test of his education begins when he accidentally locks himself in, in his own apartment. Nothing unusual here we all forget our phone at times and we try to do a hundred things before the door locks itself on us. Throughout the movie we saw the protagonist trying different ways of being stupid instead of trying to get out of the apartment. He never tried to 'really' break the door. He did put stuff on fire but again left the door out. We are talking about a grown up, healthy and educated young man here. Nothing in the movie indicates if he is lacking normal mental capabilities. This means it's just him acting stupid or Indian education system is flawed. He came up with the idea of making a slingshot from underwear elastic and using toothpaste and shaving cream to write on dark colored cardboard yet he never tried to get out. I am confused now. I am not sure if he was stupid or the writers wanted him to never get out of there. Anyway, he does gets out in the end by climbing down 5 stories balcony to balcony. To me it was the biggest surprise, I thought any minute now he will wake up back in his apartment and the escape is just his dream. But I was disappointed again. Bottom line, it is a poorly written movie. Bad attempt on a survivor flick. You are not missing anything if you skip thismindless thriller."
" Honest attempt with logical flaws
",0.5106,0.7529,2017-03-22 00:00:00,4,"Bollywood is fairly new to survival thrillers and hence awarding a harsh rating to any attempt will be an injustice.So, as the name suggests and the trailer as well - that this movie is all about a guy trying to escape an apartment in an high rise building after being trapped there for some really silly reasons. Rajkumar Rao is no newbie to acting and he has made his honest attempts to display fear, helplessness and determination. The real challenge lies in the story and the screenplay - the survival conditions put forth him are so lame that in some scenarios it looks like a high school grad can apply more brains.For e.g. - you would dial 100 / emergency line in India - rather than just dial ! When the LCD is thrown downstairs .. there would be someone to look upstairs and see what happened.. His girlfriend could have used the call trace facility to find out where the cell phone tower was ! Fire could be used for alarming the entire township ...and many more similar things.Nevertheless, Motwane should be appreciated to make an earnest attempt for making this film. For guys who really want to see good movies in survival genre, I would highly recommend - Open Water, Frozen.. and of course Cast Away !! Cheers Niks"

" Trapped: A Soft Hearted's Nightmare
",-0.5267,0.1232,2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,"*Contains Spoilers* From the makers of Udaan and Lootera comes yet another display of your dichotomy over the originality in Indian cinema... Trapped (Sure, how else would you refer to a movie shot in less than a month).Starring: Nerdy Faizal Khan, His love affair, this other lady who just couldn't help and a deaf watchman. Get on a 105 minute journey, oddly interrupted by interval, of an individual who gets trapped in his own flat. Mr. Motwane touched on a genre which is barely untouched in modern cinema- A fight in solitude, against all the odds. Lead character played by Rajkumar does not travel far and gets stuck in a situation like Into the Wild or 127 hours, but manages to get stuck in an ill advised flat in anybody's opinion (guess that's why he didn't tell his friends) to settle-in in order to get married to his Rock for all ages. However, as destiny holds, he locks himself in 35 story stranded apartment without water, food and electricity.This movie quite aptly displays a mammoth struggle of an average Indian man fighting against all the odds. Though his deliveries were not as remarkable as 'Keh ke lunga' and 'Bhagwan ke bharose mat baitho' moments, yet one cannot help but praise Rajkumar's effort and natural acting capabilities. Execution of without support five-floor climb down was close to perfection. However, he could have covered his hands for grip or use electric wires for short ropes.Further, keeping in mind Udaan and Lootera, a fan is not left disappointed screenplay wise as well. Attention to details are duly noticed and appreciated by audience who just not loses it after 'Fridge cum Bath tub invention' by lead character. On a lighter note, apparently keeping power banks is essential."

" Trapped With Awe. â™¦ Grade B+
",-0.5267,0.997,2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"If there is one thing that still makes intelligent people go to the movies, it is the little bit of realism that today's independent movies adopt. While Neeraj Ghaywan's Masaan (2015) is one such film that comes to my mind right now, this emotional thriller here is going to be on my mind when I review a next similar-kinda film.Shaurya (Rajkummar Rao) is a young working-class man who has finally found his purpose through his lady-love Noorie (Geetanjali Thapa), a coworker who is about to get married to someone else. He succeeds in cajoling her to marry and move in with him, but she only has one condition: get an apartment (rented will do) for himself and then they can start complementing each other. Shaurya agrees, pulls up his socks, and gets on with room hunting, only to be the victim of one hasty, badly-made decision.Starting from the first scene, Rao keeps you hooked with his nuanced performance, as writers Amit Joshi and Hardik Mehta slowly introduce him as this desolate youngster trying to woo one of his coworkers. The tiny amount of playful romance the film uses to kick-start what quickly becomes an ordeal for the relatable protagonist is what essentially works for the film. With shades of subtle humor and realism in every few scenes as the story slowly inches forward, the film tries to address a handful of issues. The primary one being isolation (from the outside life) and its acknowledgment. It is the central theme of the film, which it then goes to explore and come to the point that fear breeds isolation, which can only be overcome by courage.Other causes it faintly touches are real estate issues, religion, vegetarianism, and self-reliance. While it may be easy to eschew these delicate samples in the film, what you cannot ignore is the sheer simplicity of the plot-line. The film is inherently about Shaurya and his experience as a guy who gets locked up in a flat in a high-rise without food, water, or electricity, which robs him of more than just few days' life. But, what the film tries to say between the lines is something extremely relevant in this time of a connected world where people are moving away from each other.Motwane's actors are brilliant in their collective act, and are real pleasure to watch. Rao is phenomenal as the taciturn, unlucky guy whereas National Award-winning Thapa mesmerizes me in this short role that she does with finesse and loveliness. Rao has always done roles that demand a great effort, and in here, his efforts have paid off. Of course, many people could have done this, but I cannot think of anyone else who would have done such a great job. The supporting cast are well directed, and support the film in its quest to convey a message or two without inducing ennui. Of course, there are long sequences where the central character just stares into the moonlit sky, but branding them as boring is like disrespecting the art of realistic cinema. Realism, surprisingly, comes with its fair share of bitterness, and Trapped balances it perfectly.It's an emotional thriller that should be lauded for its experimental nature, minimalistic storytelling, and brilliant overall filmmaking. It wouldn't have been what it is without the arresting music by Alokananda Dasgupta, crisp editing, and fine photography. The sequences and score are going to play with your mood and your emotions as you try to pointlessly help Shaurya get out of the flat. Furthermore, it is obvious that this is a thinking man's film and not a typical Bollywood thriller.BOTTOM LINE: Vikramditya Motwane's ""Trapped"" is a brilliant fun- filled thriller made with so much less yet heavy substance that it drives home a point or two and tugs at your heartstrings once or twice all in a 100 minutes. Go watch it at your nearest theater. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO"

One fateful day, he shifted into a new apartment and got trapped inside. Nobody knows that he is in this high-rise apartment in a building, from where nobody can even listen him shouting for help. The movie is about his struggle to stay alive with limited resources and try to get out of there somehow.Vikramaditya Motwane never seizes to amaze me. All three of his directed features are so refreshing to watch. Trapped is something new altogether. Great attention has been given to even smallest of the details. The movie has the potential to make you feel claustrophobic. From the start, you can see how efficiently the movie unfolds. First, you meet the protagonist, know about him a little bit. Then, you will get acquainted with the apartment where hell will break loose as we go on. The background score is minimal in the first half to let the movie breathe a little bit, get the audience face to face with the fact that yes, the problem is so much bigger than what we anticipated. Then it picks pace. Last I remember I saw such a setting in 'Kaun' starring Urmila.No one can review Trapped without praising Rajkummar Rao. He has given a marvelous performance. He brought the perfect amount of hysteria in his voice when needed. It will make you pity the character and pray that he makes it out safely. Personally, I would say that it was even better than what we saw in 'Shahid', those of us who have seen 'Shahid' know that Rao set a high bar in that one.In just 1 hour 45 minutes, the movie boldly presents before us what a person will do when something like this happens, without actually caring if some of the scenes can be too much for some of the audience.Trapped is certainly worth a watch. You will feel like you are watching a film which is no way lesser in any aspects than any Hollywood survival movie, which we always say, ""are so much better than Bollywood movies"" Well, maybe not anymore!"
" Perfect Survival,Thriller movie. Hardly a Bollywood material. Hatsoff
",0.5719,0.9803,2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,"This is a survival film. The entire movie is within a single house where he is trapped with no water, food, electricity. Strategy to survive is appreciable. Acting is excellent. Movie with least dialogues, but gets you involved into the character. Rajkumar Rao acting is excellent. You even have sentiment added in the end, which is heartbreaking., that touches your heart.Though people are so closer to him (in distance), he literally can not communicate or seek help. How dangerous that could be. Even it is better to stay on a stranded island where you can get energy to survive because you know you can get closer to reality and sustain. But, this movie is a special case, where though you have people in your vicinity, the life still can be challenging to survive.Now, this is what is depicted nicely. Go and watch it. This movie is better than CAST AWAY(2000). I should not have compared as CAST AWAY was a very old movie. But I just wanted to let you guys know that Trapped is one of those fine thrillers which could have taken inspiration from a very raw ""CAST AWAY"" and fine tuned the survival genre."
" Rajkumar Rao returns...........
",0.0,0.9541,2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"Trapped is a brilliant piece of art.I had read about the exceptional reviews the movie had got at MAMI fest and damn,i was not not disappointed. Survival dramas are not really a forte in Bollywood.But every once in a while we get such plot driven,tight scripts that it re instills my faith in Indian cinema.Though it is on the lines of Cast away and 127 hours,what makes this unique is this not a isolated location but right in the rush-hush of Mumbai!The protagonist Shaurya (Rajkummar) gets trapped in a high rise with no food,water,electricity and the movie effectively captures his despair,attempts to break loose and finally,embracing his fears.Rajkummar is effortless and brilliant.Geetanjali is good in her short but pivotal role.Special shout out to the cinematographer and score by Aloknanda Dasgupta,its haunting! The script is the boss here,kudos to the writers to have guts to attempt something like this. Vikramaditya is top notch as usual making this engaging,nail biting movie.I did wish he captured the psychological side of Shaurya(Rajkummar) throughout his ordeal a bit more eloquently and gave it more screen time.The climax sequence could have been even more better.Overall its a great movie,must watch :)"
" Must Watch For Movie Lovers
",0.5267,-0.2565,2017-03-16 00:00:00,10,After udaan and lootera motwane took another brave step in film making. It is a vision of director motwane and perfectly executed by his crew. This gripping story has no space for a popcorn refill and trapped is no regular movie and hence not everyone will enjoy it. Motwane proved that a film has no boundaries.
" Every coincidence looks damn deliberate
",-0.4019,-0.7843,2017-03-16 00:00:00,2,"A person trapped in a flat is the subject of this film and it was quite  obvious in trailer. So after starting the film you know that everything  is being plotted for the sake of making his life miserable while he  would be trapped in the place. A quick love affair with a girl who is  going to be married soon. Boy desperately looking for a budget flat. He  was offered high rise building in Mumbai posh Prabhadevi location which  was empty since two years but surprisingly stair case and common place  seem fairly clean. Watchman of the building having listening problem so  he can't pay attention to boy shriek . Door of the flat having some  lock issue since beginning. Surprisingly light is operation only for  one day so boy can nod yes to rent out the flat!? And even the lift was  working that day!? Boy gets trapped in flat then normal water scarcity,  mobile not fully charged and when it was needed badly battery gets  drained type typical problems arise. Boy is carrying torch which is  rare commodity in Mumbai! But it was just for sake of night shot could  have been taken. Even he has match box without having habit of smoking.  Yes he had taken the goddess pic from previous PG type accommodation,  might be he was assumed religious or having habit of lighting incense  but not shown even once. He tries to grab attention by throwing HELP  written card board. A woman notices it and goes to enquiry but she does  not try to be vigil after this futile attempt. Boy lights up his  clothes in night to grab attention and it could have best way but he  didn't try again after failing once. Even you don't know how many days  have been passing since he had been trapped. There is nothing in the  name of creativity , freshness of performance."
