" Iceland is tragic and beautiful at the same time
",0.2263,0.9573,2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"In an isolated valley in Iceland, two brothers, who haven't spoken in 40 years, have to come together to save what they most cherish in life: their sheep.The location in this film is really important, like if it becomes a character in its own, and is the perfect link between the flaws and the positive points of the characters.The cold atmosphere, almost devoid of life, shapes the personality of the characters, who, for reasons that we do not know, live a bitter and constantly scornful life, until the main event of the film alters this state, and that event awakens in them a very strong and believable sense of compassion that many dramas (family conflict), like this one, use and abuse, but here, doesn't seem forced.As some movie critics have said, it's a film for those who like films, for those who enjoy a simple narrative, that take very few risks, but can deliver a very pleasant result."
" Well worth watching
",0.4588,0.9325,2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Very well presented film. The locations were superb & the cast did a great job with their performances.I haven't seen the remake released last year with Sam Neil & Michael Canton, made in WA, but it will have to be something special to better this one?Anyone who has raved about the Australian version, needs to see this & not let their bias interfere with how they rate it? Many of those who have rated it, either live in WA or are Sam Neil fans, so it doesn't have much to do with the actual movie."
" Meandered far too long
",0.0,-0.1027,2021-01-30 00:00:00,5,And the ending was far too vague to the time you'll invest watching this movie.
" (Un)Comfortable Silences
",0.0,0.6335,2020-10-02 00:00:00,5,"The harshness of the landscape, not to mention the circumstances which unfold in the film, for me overpowered any notion of humor in the film. I see it is listed as a comedy, which I think might be misleading for those of us limited to yogurt for direct Icelandic interaction.It's still a unique film, just maybe more suited for your Sunday night than Friday night viewing if you are like me. Still film/fiction as a form of perspective is always a plus, and this trip to a different country and vocation had a strong impact, a RAM tough life.When a truck or was it a snowmobile first appeared, it was a gentle shock that this was not a story from 100 years ago. Less gentle shocks follow. As a side-note, I did think of my friend ""Pete Dixon"" who shockingly died early this year of a similar, scary prion disease. I wonder if ""Pete"" saw this film, I suspect he would have dug it. RIP.The images of the desolate foothills were striking, and showed nature dominating the tiny few people on screen. The two leads were well-cast, did they come with their beards, or were those grown specifically for the film. Here in the suburbs, there is a notion that we tend to mirror our pets over time, the two brothers were quite wooly, though they lacked horns while locking horns.The payoff for the film was not so strong for me, I had a flash connection from this to ""Thelma and Louise"" - not an exact comparison, more a separated at birth/death kind of vibe. That said at the risk of stereotypes, men tend to be a lot less talkative than women. This film is quite comfortable with silences.Hmmmm, IMDB indicates an English remake on the way for what it's worth. Included on this DVD was a short ""Wrestling"" from the director which dealt with another form of brotherly love/fighting."
" Slice of life from Icelandic farms
",0.0,0.9444,2020-07-27 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those movies which flow gently and soothingly at an unhurried pace. Yet, while watching this beautiful film, there was never a moment when I checked my watch to see the time. So engrossing was the experience that I didn't want the movie to end.The plot is relatively simple. Two brothers live on adjoining farmhouses and rear sheep for a living. Due to an old feud, they haven't talked to each other in 40 years. They live independent and mostly isolated lives with the intermittent sheep competitions as the only chances of interacting with other farmers from nearby farms. To be fair, there isn't much leisure time since the work on the farms is quite labor-intensive. Preparing a tasty meal, solving a jigsaw puzzle and taking a leisurely bath are the only ways for these people to unwind. They live in solitude but one never gets the feeling that they are lonely. They are at peace; in love with their work and their sheep. They are very-well adapted to their beautiful yet harsh surroundings.The tranquil life of these sheep farmers is threatened when it is discovered that a few of the sheep are infected with the disease, scrapie. With their way-of-life under serious threat, these sheep farmers try to cope up with the tragedy as best as they can.While watching the film, I got very invested in the fate of the animals also. Wish I knew what happened to them.The beauty of Iceland through the changing seasons, the minimalism, the sheep, and the farmers; all make it a very worthy movie."
" Worth watching
",0.2263,0.7269,2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,Make sure you have a comforter to keep you warm while watching. Iceland is barren & cold.
" A visual story with more images than words
",0.0,0.9927,2019-07-11 00:00:00,8,"This is really an intriguing movie to watch. It's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't rely solely on narration or dialogue to tell their story and get their points across, and that's its biggest strength: this film is visually captivating. It tells a story more with what it shows you than what it tells you. It has a slow pace, but that's so the viewer can really soak in the environment, which I feel is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you get a good feel for what's going on in every sense, but at the same time, this is done in so many moments where the characters aren't doing much that I actually got a little bored halfway through the movie. Despite this, I ventured on giving it a fair chance. It's interesting during the first half but then it gets really interesting during the second half because that's when the pace starts to pick up more. The cinematography is excellent! There are some really powerful images produced in this movie, especially at the end. Those I felt hit home the most! I also want to give props to the editors because this didn't feel like it was edited like a typical film. They could've easily done jump cuts every few seconds throughout the entire movie, but they didn't, and that actually let the story breathe more. Fantastic work to the editors! Finally, the characters felt real. I find it hard to believe that these two brothers haven't spoken for as long as they have with their unresolved differences, but the movie portrays this in such a believable fashion. Coupled in with spectacular performances from the two leads, the characters felt all the more genuine. Overall, Hrútar (Rams), slow as it is, gives you a great piece of cinema to watch, and if you're patient with this movie, it will deliver you a story you won't forget any time soon."
" Held my attention, but ultimately let-down
",0.0,0.7542,2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Other reviews have already summarized the plot, so I will not. The film was well-acted and created a genuine sense of what the folks in a community such as this might go through under the circumstances presented. It was paced like most dramas, and had enough scene changes to keep me interested. I would have liked to have known more about the reason for the dispute between the two brothers, but it wasn't mandatory that it be explained, and the level of hatred between them was obvious. The ending was ambiguous in that we don't know if their relationship will ultimately change, or even if everyone will survive. All we do know is that, for one particular moment, they do care about each other. But my main issue with the movie is this - exactly what did they hope to accomplish by taking the sheep to the mountains? The 'authorities' already knew the one brother had not destroyed all of his sheep, so there was no way they were going to get away with keeping them unless they decided to live in the mountains, and even then, it's likely they would have been caught sooner or later since the authorities specifically mentioned the sheep might have been taken to the mountains. So for me, the ending was completely lacking in logic, and for this type of film, that's a deal-breaker. This is not a film I would recommend."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.8684,2018-09-28 00:00:00,7,"I was disappointed with this film. Possibly I was unlucky and got a dud copy, but the English subtitles failed about three-quarters of the way through and though they eventually came back, I had missed the crucial interactions, and so never found out what the quarrel between the men had been. The ending also left major questions unanswered. My disappointment also came partly from the expectation that I had of an ethnographic film. I expected traditionally-built houses and farm buildings, traditional crafts, traditional celebrations of the annual round of the agricultural year, and so on. These are modern, though small, farmers, living in modern houses, and the folksiest event they have is the judging of the best ram. There isn't even much about sheep husbandry - I'm none the wiser, for instance, about what the symptoms of scrapie actually are."
" Much more than just sheep farming
",0.0,0.7346,2018-09-13 00:00:00,7,"An underrated gem. Equally funny and heartbreaking, beautifully shot, directed, acted and most importantly - genuine."
" Pride, brotherhood, rams.
",0.34,0.969,2018-03-21 00:00:00,7,"A very nice film about the pride of two old brothers, pride for what they've been doing for their entire life: raising up rams of a special and rare race, while not talking to each other for 40 years, until the love for those rams smashes the silence between them.
It's also very well shot, with some astonishing views.
Simple but also so strong and beautiful."
" Obstinance and Fortitude
",0.0,0.8825,2018-03-05 00:00:00,9,"As a knitter, I was drawn to this movie because of the Icelandic sweaters and the sheep. I expected it to be some kind of silly comedy about sibling rivalry in a remote clime and thought I'd watch a few minutes just to look at the sweaters. Instead, I wandered into a riveting tale of duty and survival in very harsh conditions and humans who demonstrate an unfailing fortitude in dealing with overwhelming circumstances. This is actually a tale about farmers dealing with the injustice of Scrapie affecting their village (this alone would have drawn me to this movie). The cinematography was rich and I was not disappointed in the authentic Icelandic sweaters that evoked the picturesque backdrop. Well acted, beautifully filmed, and certainly worth watching."
" Entertaining
",0.4404,0.95,2018-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Though there was only scene in this movie that I found funny, I still very much enjoyed it. This movie is beautifully shot, the characters are believable, and the story is well-written. Though it starts off slow, its worth watching all the way through. I'd recommend this movie to pretty much everyone."
" An Icelandic sheep farm drama
",0.0,0.9872,2017-11-18 00:00:00,8,"This is I believe the first movie from Iceland that I saw. And it takes one to a very different atmosphere. That of farmers in the cold Icelandic conditions. The setting in the movie is great both with it's beauty and by contributing to the mood of the movie. It is a very depressing and grey movie but it has some special strength and beauty about it.The main actors do an amazing job by doing very realistic acting. One feels like one is really watching farmers living their daily lives and during a crisis. They show their emotions in a very unforced and raw way.The story and how much they need their sheep is an important piece that adds to the characters and the depth of their story. We see the love these men have for the animals and what a big part of their life it is. The ending is a very special scene, it ends in an abrupt way but the story that they were telling us is told to the end without us missing anything."
" Brother's Bond
",0.0,0.937,2017-09-15 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Can slaughtering herds of sheep mend a brother's relationship? This film asks that question. Another film that hooked me in with a novel title and a bold image of nothing less than a Ram's head on the cover. (ha) This story revolves around two brothers who haven't spoken for 40 years. They live in an isolated Icelandic valley amongst other sheep herders. Both brothers produce award winning rams as the bloodline of their flocks is ancient and strong. When a terminal disease infects the animals, the village votes to slaughter them all. During this turmoil, events occur and make the brothers interactfor better or worse? This film also has a methodical pace that helps accentuate the vast and emptiness of their land and lives. A good and quiet little drama with dashes of dry humor sprinkled in."
" Biblical sheep-raiders.
",0.0,0.8746,2017-07-05 00:00:00,6,"""After all, you two have not talked to each other for forty years. Why start now?"" ""Hrútar"" is an Icelandic saga about two brothers - sheep-raiders - weathery and persistent. To a certain extent biblical, similar to Cain and Abel, or Esau and Jacob's fates. ""Brothers don't necessarily have to say anything to each other – they can sit in a room and be together and just be completely comfortable with each other."" That's pretty much it. ""Hrútar"" is also a very fine and accurate composition of image, setting and atmosphere. And sounds from Atli Örvarsson."
" Are people like rams?
",0.3612,0.9978,2017-05-27 00:00:00,7,"The film is laconic, atmospheric, calm, cold, bright, beautiful, artistic drama about love and hate of two brothers. From the very first second this Icelandic breathtaking cold atmosphere is longing throughout the whole film till the last second. Without any doubts, people who are not used to this type of films, who are not used to spend time looking deeper for protagonists characters, for them it will look a bit slow, as the story line is developing slowly but all the developments are in details, short conversations. Each picture is saying something, as for example as one of the brothers is reading a book next to the Rams what shows how much he loves his animals and spends long time with them. Film almost does not contain close-ups, its always middle shots and wide shots. Especially the views of mountains are amazing. Music is originally written for the film what is the best choice as it fits perfectly the way it is, it makes look picture very deep and emotional. Director has used TV and a radio as a very good tool to show that world lives with global bad news but private life does not touch or interest anybody else. Main characters are absolute opposite. One is calm and quiet but another one is more active with temperament. They have not spoken for 40 years and film does not explain why, but I think that is the idea, they don't know themselves. Director clearly wants to show with this film that these situations are not the best and you should love your family members, as at the end they are the ones who you can trust. It somehow shows that these people are mirroring character of the animal they love. Stubbornness and careless. Any kind of unhappiness always brings something positive. As it happens to the brothers and shows that human being is much more important than anything else. For me personally it was very emotional and open ending just fascinated me. I would recommend this film to people who love unusual stories, dark and deep atmospheric environment and who would just like to think about what is priorities in their life as we all have it different....or the same?"
" Two brothers and lots of sheep
",0.0,0.5529,2017-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Gummi (the quiet, introvert one) and Kiddi (the aggressive, drunkard, trigger-happy one) are a couple of brothers who live right to each other but haven't spoken for 40 years (whatever the reason). However they not only live like 10 meters from each other, but are also in the same business: sheep.And when Gummi discovers Kiddi's sheep are sick and the authorities decide all the sheep in the valley have to be sacrificed, they will have to reevaluate their lives.""Hrútar"" is a movie that doesn't take the easy route. It is dark, unrelenting, bleak, with a simple but direct, to the point, use of locations and pace. Grímur Hákonarson is just trying to tell a story, with almost no flourishes or humor (which, when it appears, is so out of the blue that it is kind of a shock). And he does a good job, helped by composed performances of the two actors who play the brothers. The locations are also beautiful, and the sheep (and dog) do a good job with their hard part.However, the movie is so bleak and detached, that it makes it hard for the viewer to really invest in the characters. The story is so simple and the pace comes so much to a crawl in some paces, that the overall effect of the relationship between the two brothers suffers.For fans of slow-paced, with long silences and subtle messages, movies, ""Hrútar"" answers their prayers, but for everyone else, the movie is just average."
" Somewhat touching (especially if you're an animal lover).
",0.0,0.9072,2017-01-24 00:00:00,7,"'RAMS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) An Icelandic drama about two estranged sheep farming brothers, that are forced to deal with a tragic infection; which wipes out both of their flocks. The film was written and directed by Grimur Hakonarson. It stars Sigurour Sigurjonsson and Theodor Juliusson. The movie's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also won a few prestigious awards. I found it to be a little too slow-paced, but it is somewhat touching (especially if you're an animal lover).Gummi (​​Sigurjonsson) and Kiddi (Juliusson) are two sheep farming brothers in Iceland. They haven't talked to each other in over forty years, despite the fact that they live across from each other. When one of their flocks is infected by a deadly infection, called scrapie, all of the sheep in the area have to be killed (in order to avoid re-infection). One brother decides to hide some of his (seemingly) uninfected sheep; and the two decide to work together, for the first time in several years, in order to protect them.The movie is beautifully shot, and it's filled with decent performances. I don't feel like I got to know the brothers that well, but I still ended up caring about them; and I especially cared about their sheep. Although the movie doesn't go into great detail, about the two brothers' lives (or their past relationship), you can tell that they really cared about their sheep. So I definitely cared about them.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"
" Essentric Humour Laced With Grim Reality
",-0.1531,-0.5902,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"What can you truly say about an Icelandic film that features - as the principal story line - two sheep farming brothers who've not spoken to each other in 40years? Yes, it looks good (this part of the worlds film makers are the last to leave a scene on screen for long enough for the viewer to fully say they saw it!). Only problem here, is the scenes, like the story, are minimalist. The performances are untypical so you feel you could be watching a documentary about the actual farmers of the region - this is a plus. The landscapes are stark and shot to capture the vast emptiness with cold honesty. The music is as stark and cold as the story and surroundings - also a plus. The story reminds us of the sibling rivalry that raked several Biblical families and nations. The real star just could have been the astoundingly intelligent dog who acts as the go-between-postal service between these two somewhat ignorant men - this animal has to seen to be believed. The tragedy of devastating livestock diseases that sweep through these isolated farming communities is understandably gut wrenching for every poor soul involved but, the main focus of the story poses other asides that don't seem to be fully explored.If you, like me, don't feel satisfied with open-ended finales...endings where you have to imagine the final outcome, then you may not be fulfilled by the final fade out. Yes, there are only two possibilities as closures but, which one was it! OK, there is a resolve to some relationship aspects --but you felt that coming anyway-- so what about survival? the possibility between life or death in these frozen outdoor situations is as minimal as the story and gets to be less so with each exposed minute...Overall this is reasonably good character study (albeit odd characters) that keeps you watching even though it could have offered a touch more. Not for Action aficionados but at least it beats the cheap World Movie channel's usual perverse trash-fests hands down!"
