" Horrible Attempt at Comedy Horror. REAL Comedy Horror Suggestions Included Below
",-0.7845,0.9968,2021-02-19 00:00:00,2,"I Love Comedy Horror and I like fun mindless movies to watch once and awhile when you don't want to think too much, as some can be really funny!! But this one is not, it's just the mindless part without the fun or humor. (I'm basically saying it's sucks lol!)I can judge a movie pretty easily by simply re-watchability and this one I would never watch again. This is one of those where I had to kind of force myself to get to the end.I think the only time I laughed was once during a son/parent talk. The rest of it just seemed like a bunch of random stuff edited together, and boring dialogue.Also the A-list actors are pretty much just cameos if you you were thinking of watching this just b/c of that, which I didn't, but figure that's worth mentioning too.Maybe teens would like this, idk. But there are much better movies out there.If you want to see a REAL Comedy Horror that's actually good and actually funny, watch - The Baby Sitter: Killer Queen (2020) - Now THAT is a good movie and super funny!! I recommend that 100%.After that one, if you want another suggestion, Dance of the Dead (2008) - that was pretty good. Heck even - Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse (2015) - was a 10 compared to this garbage. That was ok too.Anyways, Trust me, I would not recommend watching this, even if it's free haha. Not kidding."
" Fun kooky movie
",0.5106,0.9562,2020-10-29 00:00:00,7,"Fun kooky movie. Some bloody elements but these are low to the absurd humor of the film. Earnest acting, fun script, and good direction make this a good watch. Horror comedy done well."
" Only a 5.9 WHAT? This movie is hilarious!!
",0.508,0.9526,2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Funny, great acting, great plot, great direction,I haven idea what people want when I reviewed this hilarious movie it only had a 5.9 I FRICKING dont get why? It's not a oscar contender it's a comedy horror, and it is exactly that!! Ignore the negative grumpy people and have a great time and laugh!!!!"
" Fantastic Pandemic Fun
",0.7845,0.7184,2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"I have come to this film (repeatedly) during the current 2020 pandemic crisis. I found it to be great fun. It's probably a 7 but I've given it an 8 because, why not?It deserves a better score than its current IMDB rating.Surly a cult classic in the waiting."

" A fun twist on an already satirized and populated market
",0.5106,0.9938,2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,"When reading the description for this film it promised Vampires vs Zombies vs Humans, and in that it didn't fail to deliver. It was also described as horror comedy, and I can see how that might be the case.it did serve up occasional humour as well as a good amount of blood splatter. The film follows a young American high school kid who is struggling to find his place in life/ school/ and a town which is populated by humans, vampires and zombies - it's kind of a coming of age film. He fancies his neighbour, a flirty stoner chick; she's not interested because she's into a jock, who happens to be the brother of his ex-best friend, whom he's grown distant from over the years; they're both having occasional trouble due to the school bully, who happens to be a vampire - who's evidently trying to seduce girls but opts for biting them rather than having sexual relations with them. On top of all this, zombies seem to be alienated as lesser citizens; the teachers are as messed up as everybody else. Oh, and pretty much everybody in the entire town seems to have some crazy issue going on.Aliens randomly turn up which acts as the torch paper for the town going crazy, humans, vampires and zombies collide in an all-out conflict which sees a lot of bloodshed and carnage. The aliens seem to be winning the war, having apparently wiped out pretty much the entire town. So it's up the 3 kids the save the town; one a human, his ex-best friend who is now a zombie, a girl he's known since 6th grade, who is now a vampire. And so the journey/ coming of age/ adventure film begins.Based on the description for the film and having not heard of it before I would have thought it was a super-low budget film - but that can't be the case as it's littered with some well-known actors and celebrities, also the visuals and effects can't have been that cheap, it's go some elements of CGI - which again can't be cheap, and it's not that small of a film, you do get the sense that you travel across town and visit a few different locations.I feel as though I enjoyed the film; I didn't at first, the opening 20-30mins felt like pretty much any high-school teen film, albeit with different themed characters all thrown together. After the aliens landed and the conflicts exploded, that's when I started to pay a little more attention to it. Granted the film was a little clich√©d with some of the developments, and in parts it was predictable, but it was still good fun and didn't take itself too seriously. The cast delivered a fine mixed performance, ranging from some cheesy and hammy portrayals, to some surprisingly good deliveries. My rating for this film is 6 out of 10, it's better than some of the more mainstream high school films that I've seen, but has room for improvement too. An enjoyable and harmless waste of time."
" A Well Written Film... Acted Well... Nicely Directed... But Doesn't Work...
",0.3612,-0.2127,2019-07-28 00:00:00,5,"This film is the story of a man who had an idea and ran with it... Oren Uziel the writer.This is listed as a Comedy Horror Sci-Fi, though these are very loose categories as it's not funny and it's not scary and the aliens are only there as a driving force. In fact, the only category this film should be listed in is irritating.So, you ask, if it's so irritating why have you given it a five-star rating?I'm glad you asked.The story idea is sound. Humans, Zombies, Vampires, and Werewolves have found a way to co-exit. They even go to school together, though they do have their own niches and cliques. This social cohesion is tenuous and one night it all falls apart when the Zombies rebel against the others. Their uprising is short-lived as the aliens arrive and start disintegrating the town members.It's the fact that everybody is excepted and that nobody is the boogeyman, not even the newly Earthed aliens, that takes this out of the horror genre. If anything it's more dark fantasy.For the most part, the writing is intelligent and strong and coupled with above-average acting it should be a decent and watchable movie. Trouble is it doesn't work. When this is combined with Robbie Pickering's direction it takes on the feel of trying too hard and comes off as pretentious at times.The worst letdown is the film's humour. It would have enhanced the movie if the jokes had been a little darker and used various styles of joke-telling. Add one-liners, slapstick, sarcasm, and the long gag. The greats used everything they had in their bag of tricks to make us laugh... and even invented more. This movie though just goes for shouting and being a moron. If the character does both, as in The Teachers Lounge scene it's going to be a laugh riot...NOT... The scene is risible and cringeworthy. I was close to turning off at this point and a part of me wishes I'd followed through.At least the Big Change scene was nearly funny, thanks to both Joan Cusak and Bob Odenkirk.If you like Horror or SciFi films I say stay away from this. If you like Comedy or Dark Fantasy I'd only recommend this if you definitely had absolutely nothing to watch. If anything, it's an example of how and why some films don't work. So if you're a budding film-maker then watch this film and learn how it shouldn't be done."
" Maybe I'm too old to appreciate this
",0.4019,0.9136,2019-07-26 00:00:00,4,"In the small town of Pillford vampires, zombies and humans live side by side in relative harmony, well that is until the arrival of an alien spaceship.
FoN is certainly a melting pot of monsters and I like the premise, the special effects are good and the acting is adequate. However this is a horror comedy and I am afraid that I found it a tad too silly at times, plus there are periods of boring dialogue which drags it down. Obviously this is aimed at a teenage audience, I'm sure that the ""kids"" will appreciate it more than a middle aged, lifelong horror fan such as myself."
" Laboured
",0.0,-0.753,2019-07-24 00:00:00,4,"FREAKS OF NATURE is another mindless horror comedy that goes for the lowbrow rather than the jugular. The cast is populated by vampires, zombies and aliens, but all of them are either silly-looking or animated by bad CGI. As usual, the humour is of the crude variety, with unpleasant characters running around and trying not to get killed by various menaces. They'd have you believe that there's originality and freshness in the idea of vampires and zombies co-existing with the human race in society, but this is never handled in an engaging way; it's just an excuse for laboured, high school-bound gags and juvenalia."
" Freak Show
",-0.4404,-0.1759,2019-06-10 00:00:00,6,"Humans, vampires and zombies living together in a town and an alien invasion - fun flick for the horror addict - what you are waiting for!?"
" Charming
",0.5859,0.7805,2019-04-28 00:00:00,7,"This film is charming. It is not perfect, but I love the concept and the just has fun with it not taking itself too seriously but also not destroying the atmosphere by just be silly, it had a healthy balance"
" Only a handful can like this
",0.3612,0.8117,2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,It's a rare combo of comedy and I really love this kind of movies accidentally found on YouTube but glad that I have seen it only a handful of people can like these sort of movies and for others not recommend
" Hidden Gem
",0.0,0.9135,2018-10-07 00:00:00,10,"Fun-filled action-packed comedy.
Relationship focused and coming of age story that won't bore you to sleep. Very well done. Love the exploding vampires"
" Ok film with an great cast
",0.743,0.9835,2018-09-30 00:00:00,4,"It was ok film, nothing special. I thought the story was abit over the top. It was pretty funny at times. I thought the cgi effects looked abit cheap. The acting was pretty good especially from Vanessa Hudgens & Mackenzie Davis and Keegan-Michael Key. I would definitely watch it again at somepoint. Can't beat seeing Hudgens covered in blood lol it's so sexy for some reason lol. The blood and gore effects was pretty good. 4/10"
" THEY'RE EATING MY BOWLING ARM!
",0.0,0.6718,2018-05-13 00:00:00,8,"In the small town of Dillford, known for ""the riblet"" (McRib) there are three major cliques in the town/high school. These are zombies, vampires, and humans. One vampire resembles Edward named Milan Panache (Ed Westwick) from ""Twilight"" and likes human Petra (Mackenzie Davis) because she is ""pale and veiny"" There exists quirky situations where the one liners are frequent and humorous. When the aliens attack, a human, vampire, and zombie team together to save the town.This is a campy film. The film is funny, but not hilarious. It is cult in nature, but falls short from being a cult classic. If you liked ""The Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" this one I would place a peg below. Not for everyone.Guide: Frequent F-bombs. Sex. Rear nudity."
" F-Bombs of nature
",0.0,0.5175,2017-08-05 00:00:00,1,"Oren Uziel has confused F-bombs for dialog. Admittedly, some of the actors may have been allowed to ad-lib profanity here and there, but it all quickly added up to the point where that's all we heard. No one I know talks like this and I live in Los Angeles!Loved the premise. Usually like zombie/vampire/alien movies, but this was tooooo much to put up with. Turned it off after 15 minutes."
" Should have been a parable for tolerance - but is a propagandist offense instead
",-0.2263,0.8074,2017-06-28 00:00:00,3,"Here we go again. Hollywood (and the USA) once was a place of dreams, justice, truth and bravery,now it's a political issue, a vehicle for disgusting, aggressive, ignorant, intolerant propaganda to push the nationalistic (yes, like in N...) wish to be great again - or better to show itself better than any other nation. This should and could have been a fun and educative teen movie about tolerance, but instead, even in an Alien movie, Hollywood cannot not slander Europe/Germany by letting the Alien (which is trying to show them their intolerant, hateful ways - ironic) talk with a German accent, by letting the characters insanely chant ""USA, USA..."" and cheering about sustaining their intolerance, fighting off the person trying to show them their ignorance and intolerance and being as propagandistic as can be. If there is any Nazis/Nazi-like behavior, it can be found in Hollywood/USA. In violently trying to make America great again, Hollywood is successively destroying everything that once made America great, that people all over the world admired, who now cannot find any reason anymore to further defend such aggressive, arrogant behavior - other nations overcome their flaws, the USA broadens them and celebrates this approach. A shame."
" I just discovered this and it rocked my cult loving world
",0.5994,-0.4939,2017-06-06 00:00:00,10,"Using 80s nostalgia (and featuring Joan Cusack who is an 80's movie Queen) this movie jumps right into action in the opening seconds. In this world zombies are real and even attend High School wearing special neck braces that keep them at bay. Vampires and Zombies also exist and this is all the agreed upon normal way of life. Though, they don't get along well...and there is some violence (ahem) Until aliens arrive and they have to cut their own chaos in order to fight a common enemy. I love the actors in this and am a fan of Mackenzie Davis who was in a spectacular episode of Black Mirror (if you have not seen yet it is a must). I feel like she is a rising star and we will see a lot more of her."
" Sounds dumb - but you'll love it.
",0.6858,0.9914,2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"I had very low hopes that this type of mash-up would be watchable. The trashy concept seemed like something Troma would think up.But, this was a greatly enjoyable film. FoN had a decent budget, decent actors, and a director who absolutely knew what he wanted. I think the sheer audacity of the film makes it a credit to the genre.I found the combination effect of such incredibly separate sub- genres fascinating from start to finish. I loved the over-the-top characters, gore scenes and depth of the story. It was so well balanced, something that would have been very difficult given the outlandish story-line. A lot of respect must go to the writers for the background coverage, and the director/producer for such an entertaining piece of work. This ability seems to have become a lost art.The teen-angst angle was hilarious, for a change. I laughed out loud during several scenes - a sure indication that I'm watching a winner. They took a bunch of stereo-typical situations and ragged on them mercilessly.FoN is a really funny, quality black comedy that you might even want to keep in your collection. I highly recommend it to the true horror fan."
