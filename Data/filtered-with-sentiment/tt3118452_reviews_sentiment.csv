" i'm not angry just disappointed
",0.6435,-0.8738,2021-04-08 00:00:00,5,"Physically i'm fine emotionally i'm bruised
crushingly disappointed by the ending - no explanation or pointers as to what would happen beyond this film
terribly disappointing end to our fabulous day
we visited the centre to buy some chocolates and food and then we had pizzas - i had a spicy meat feast
we had a brownie while watching this film and then we were crushed by the lack of explanation in this sci-fi universe.I just want to know what to do to prevent an event similar to this from happening to me
This film didn't help at all
Have a good day, because i didn't."
" Waste of life
",-0.4215,-0.6377,2021-04-04 00:00:00,3,"If you have time to waste, don't watch. The movie was filmed in someone's basement with a $30 budget and an iPhone 4. Simple concept, assumable result, not entertaining."
" Movie was good till just before it ends
",0.4404,-0.4939,2021-03-30 00:00:00,5,Whole movie was good but and was dissatisfied to me . Yeah it has to end on reasonable note but it didn't . At the end i was feeling why i have wasted my 90 minutes.
" So Aliens gathered the dumbest people who ever walked the Earth?
",-0.5106,-0.9953,2021-03-24 00:00:00,2,"I know there are no more movies set basically in just one room with clever dialogues anymore (such as 12 Angry Men, Dial M for Murder or The Maltese Falcon, all masterpieces) but there is for example a TV movie of 10 years ago, The Sunset Limited starring Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones talking for about 1 hour and a half of their visions about life and religion and is a good movie also with interesting exchanging of lines between the two. In this case hell no! Apart from the bad acting of most of the ""actors"" the lines and the arguments are so lame and boring as hell. Everybody knows the nowadays issues or what an average (but not so smart) American citizen has in its own mind, we all know and we don't want to listen the same old stuff in the most naive and demagogic vision (about racism, atheism, veterans of war, gender equality et cetera) not saying they're not important but they're not shown in a wise way, moreover considering also that themes such as these are not very related in a movie based on an alien abduction game-experiment! Seriously a room with Tom Hanks speaking alone with his Wilson ball would have been way better, at least we would have heard something exciting about life to think! I saw this movie years ago when it came out but I forgot everything of it (don't remember if I fell asleep or was victim of alien abduction myself) now I remember why but yes, it's too late, my bad I didn't rate it - that's the reason why I'll be rating every movie I'm seeing from now on so thank you IMDb, my extern archive of memory."

8 Stars because it surprised me and hooked me up."

" Average Thriller
",0.1027,-0.0865,2021-02-09 00:00:00,5,"Everything about this film is average really, even down to the cast. Once you've seen it once it's kinda hit and miss watching it again."
" People reveal who they really are in their final moments
",0.0,0.7964,2021-02-03 00:00:00,8,"In ""The Dark Knight"" joker says people reveal who they really are in their final moments. I guess you could say this movie is the practical testing of that hypothesis.
Its an edge of the seat thriller with 50 people in a room judging who dies next each minute.
Under normal circumstances you will never know what a person is thinking but in this case of ""gun against the head"", everyone started thinking outloud.
The journey in this movie potrays the reasons people give as to why they should live and/or why others should die.
The ending portrayed how the intellectual finally triumphed over the emotional.Not going into too much detail I'll say this movie is not for everyone, which probably explains the rating, but for people who enjoy such thrillers this movie is a solid 7.5."
" Roped in by the title, left unsatisfied
",-0.4019,0.945,2021-02-01 00:00:00,4,"I was hoping for some grand metaphor. Or like a gotcha moment. It never came. The premise is kind of interesting, but too much whining. There is a ton of missed opportunity.I honestly watched it because I remembered a different movie with the same title about like social media or something, so I thought this was supposed to be like a metaphor for that. Nope.And then there's a similar foreign film that is also a thriller called ""Cube"". My brain tricked me into meshing the title of a bunch of geometric sounding movies, and I landed on this one. Not terrible, but definitely not the movie I wanted to watch.The carpet/floor thing looked enticing, so I clicked.Idk, the whole movie is like a bottle episode with characters that nobody cares about. And it ends with the same amount of questions that it started with.Like it was going for a very...like Cloverfield meets Saw meets Battlefield Los Angeles kind of deal. But, yeah, man idk what to tell you. It wasn't good.Good opportunity to get some faces on a screen though, I'll tell ya that. Those actors really acted. That's what carried this. I kind of have a soft spot for these low-budget productions that try something new. You really feel the group effort. So that was cool. Still a bad movie though, lol."
" Nice concept

There would be nice if there is a connection between the guys and a proper explanation who is doing it and what for - some revenge story because of a tragedy where they all participated would be niceAlways the stupid explanation with aliensVery disappointing that they didn't explain anything and this is what annoys me the most in these kinda movies"
" A great movie
",0.6249,0.7906,2021-01-23 00:00:00,7,A great movie. Good message and actors and actress
" GOOD
",0.4404,0.7003,2021-01-22 00:00:00,5,"I discovered this movie thanks to Netflix. The scenario is just worthy of a reality TV game. The ending is uninteresting, without understanding how the characters got there, what is the goal of the game, who organized the game."
" Not a Soldier
",0.0,0.2263,2021-01-18 00:00:00,6,They kept referring to the Marine as a Soldier. Soldiers are in the Army. They also called him GI Joe- also a Soldier reference. He is in uniform and clearly has a name tape stating Marine. Just bothers me.
" Boring

" Dead boring
",-0.765,-0.8272,2021-01-06 00:00:00,1,Watched the first 15 minutes knew it would be a waste of time a nothing story luckily I read some reviews where people wasted 1 hour and 20 something minutes of their lives. Don't do it to yourself.
" Rubbish and no sense...
",-0.296,0.5572,2021-01-06 00:00:00,2,"I tried to resume this movie and best idea was imagine a 5 min inside a subway watching 2 people arguing, with xenophobia comments. Imagine you stay sit, remain calm observing them, listening to them in some occasion but you don't really care what they are saying and you will forget all of it at the moment that you get off the train. Well, now imagine that 5 min subway discussion extended to almost 1,30hr. If you have that free time then go for it, otherwise you won't miss anything, this movie makes no sense and there are tons of better movies to spend the time with. The acting is also terrible. It looks that the writer/director only made this movie to spit all their xenophobia/racism that have inside, and making a movie was just an excuse. ;)"
" Nice
",0.4215,-0.1001,2020-12-30 00:00:00,7,The movie is good but the final is very bad anyway is good
" Definitely not for everyone
",0.4019,0.9531,2020-12-23 00:00:00,6,"I'm a huge fan of claustrophobic psychological thrillers like these, so i enjoyed this movie a lot. Even though the acting falls flat, and the social politics scattered throughout are shoved down your throat with two hands, the concept is strong enough to hold tension and keep me engaged.Ending was a mild disappointment, but the ending wasn't exactly the point. The game was.Not the greatest movie ever, but i thought it was great for what it was."
" Started interestingly, huge dissapointment in the end
",0.6124,-0.9322,2020-12-23 00:00:00,3,"The idea behind it was pretty solid, and the movie started pretty good. Unfortunately after the first half quality dropped quickly. Bad acting, decisions that made no sense, allaiances that make no sense in real life and an ending so bad i felt extremely cheated.How do they even make decisions based on leadership? At one point the ""leaders"" were negotiating about trading votes like they had control over the other players. Ridiculous. I swear it just got laughable.The ending was so bad i said to myself why did i waste my time with this movie. Yes the twist was interesting but we get no catharsis and no explanation about what really happened or happens next. Just some bad cgi.Not worth your time."
" Circle
",0.0,-0.5165,2020-12-21 00:00:00,1,"Movie is very bad., The whole purpose of the plot is still unknown/unidentified. Also it's not engaging makes us literally boring."
" Great until the end of course
",0.6249,0.9229,2020-12-21 00:00:00,3,Im so over all these film makers thinking its a great idea to leave open ended endings. Its a waste of time! Thought it was good until once again an ending with no real explanation of anything. If you like a good ole choose your own adventure ending than you will enjoy this movie!
" This film will piss you off right from the first scene
",-0.4019,-0.1945,2020-12-05 00:00:00,2,This entire film was ludicrous from the opening scene until the credits rolled. iMDB claims the budget was about $2 mil - where I'm thinking the entire time the budget couldn't have been more than $300k. Don't waste your time with this hunk of garbage. People that think this is a great movie obviously have something wrong with them.This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched in my 49 years and my GF in CT also thinks this is a pile of dog ****.
" Not bad at all...

" A little Horror, very little Sci-Fi, a fascinating document of humanity (though the book should receive most of the credit)
",0.0202,-0.9846,2020-11-21 00:00:00,7,"I usually enjoy watching (and reviewing) mostly Horror films, but as any Netflix subscriber is surely aware by now - the options for this genre are quite limited. Therefore, I've decided to ""settle"" for a suspenseful thriller, read the short description of Circle an figured it should have certain Horror elements (at least as far of modern Horror is considered). Luckily, I was right, and more importantly - Circle has turned out to be quite a rewarding experience.From the very beginning the setting reminded me of the Saw anthology: a bunch of people (I believe it's around 50) wake up trapped and are forced to try and figure out how to survive. Very soon they find out that every couple of minutes one of them is killed, and moreover - they're supposed to collectively decide who it's going to be. It's important to say that aside from the eventually apparent cause of their captivity and the manner in which the ""lucky"" chosen are in fact chosen - Circle has very, very few Sci-Fi elements. If you're looking for a film that's actually Sci-Fi - you might be understandingly disappointed.As the prisoners grasp their predicament and begin trying to first make sense of it and later survive it - Circle becomes a bluntly and painfully realistic criticism of humanity and human society. Racism, egoism, deceit and apathy draw a very unflattering picture of the average human being, and the audience can't help but wonder: is this me? Would I be able to remain human in the face of such circumstances? And besides, how would one define ""remaining human"", by the norms and conventions of society, or by a more subjective moral attitude (which is just as legitimate under the circumstances)?The story, in my opinion, is exquisite, though it's important to stress that credit is due to the book, not the film. I also found the acting to be pretty decent, though none of the characters left a lasting impression. Also, the ending involves quite a plot twist followed by a pretty surprising conclusion, which serves to create a series of rapid unpredictable events. While I'm admittedly a sucker for good plot twists - I can't help but feeling that I might and should have seen it coming, so other viewers might be a little annoyed with how obvious the ending was.All in all, I'm very pleased that I chose to give Circle a chance, even if only to witness the incredible dark and grim interactions between the characters as they settle the struggle between their consciences and basic urges of self-preservation. While my first recommendation would be that you read the book - to watch the film would be a close second."
" Fun Concept
",0.5106,0.3407,2020-11-19 00:00:00,4,"It's an interesting concept, and actually kind of fun to watch, but in the end it just feels like a massive waste of time."
" Decent concept with believable acting
",0.0,-0.9644,2020-11-15 00:00:00,6,"This one wasn't quite what I expected. It definitely delves into a lot of social commentary and explores how people react to a crisis, and how they treat each other when forced into a life-or-death situation from which there seems to be no escape.However, if seeing people be terrible to each other over things like race, class status, etc. upsets you, you may want to avoid this one, or at least go into it prepared to bite down on a blanket when the rage starts kicking in. The characters in this movie do NOT handle things well and spend a lot of time being rude or just plain antagonistic toward each other. Part of that is due to the fact that people tend to become stressed and volatile during a desperate situation, but the writing really takes it over the top. There were several times that I had to pause and go take some deep breaths because the anger I felt toward the characters for being awful toward each other was so intense.Beyond that, it's a good suspense movie. There's a lot of tension surrounding how things will end, and you're never entirely sure what's going to happen next."
" I want 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life back
",0.0772,0.81,2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,For me to enjoy a movie I need to care about at least 2 characters. It would be nice if they could act but not required. I didn't give a fiddlers fart about any of them. Circle was like a high school production written by students with a budget of 50 bucks.
" Unexpected To Be So Good
",0.4927,-0.4973,2020-10-24 00:00:00,7,This movie had me scratching my head whether to watch it or not but I am glad I did.
" I annoyingly liked this
",0.4215,0.9566,2020-10-23 00:00:00,7,"Won't lie, I had absolutely no expectations on this film. I just lumped it on and hoped for the best. And I was actually pleasantly shocked (in a good way) about this film. It sounds like something that wouldn't be entertaining, 50 people stood round a circle and choosing one to die every few minutes. But I believe it's done really well, kept me interested throughout and generally just well done. Especially for a low budget film.My only real issue I had was the ending. I thought it was a little flat. I feel it needed a bit more explaining than what we got given.On the whole though it was a strong 7/10 and glad I watched."
" I don't understand the bad reviews
",0.431,0.9538,2020-10-22 00:00:00,8,I thought that was actually really good with a massive surprise ending that I definitely wasn't expecting. I didn't understand how they got there but the rest of the film was massively entertaining. Trust me give it a chance you won't regret it.

" Unique thriller, poor acting
",-0.4019,0.9001,2020-10-10 00:00:00,6,"A great story that is unique and keeps you engaged. The film isn't drawn out and keeps well to time. The small set and the way they made the film was great. However, the acting is poor so you don't connect well with the characters."
" Decent movie of this genre
",0.0,0.8008,2020-10-10 00:00:00,7,"If you liked movies like Exam or The cube you ll at least enjoy it. Although they are similar, this movie is like an outlet version of them, just slightly worse. Be warned, there is political commentary. Numerous reviews from conservatives address in a negative light, but I do not consider that this commentary will prevent you from enjoying the movie, unless you have extreme prejudices. Overall, its pretty decent."
" Liked it: overall it's fine
",0.5574,0.9701,2020-10-09 00:00:00,7,"The first half is pretty much bland, kind of rushed and a litle bit messy. Still fairly entertaining though.The second half on the other hand was for me, pretty phenomenal. Dialogues and interactions got way better and more interesting and the tension was more noticeble and better constructed. There were a few ""plot twists"" that I didn't see coming like the married couple one, which I found really interesting. And the final kill where the last guy tricked the litle girl and the pregnant woman was fairly well done, I could see it but it was not so obvious, it was decently built up as a final litle plot twist to truly represent human nature, which is pretty much was this movie is about.However, for a movie with that theme and that happened all in one room without moving, it really lacked depth in the dialogues, especially in the first half which is pretty lackluster as I said before.The end was meh, I didn't like it at all. I would've rather that the guy just went out and we didn't see anything else, for it to be more ambiguous or even that at the end, he died too, as a consequence of selfishness and part of the message of the movie as a whole.I also really liked how it was capable of building tension without anyone touching or getting near to each other at all. You felt that they wanted to punch each other to death but they couldn't move so that tension had to be built up by pure dialogue and acting, in which to me, they suceeded for the most part.Concluding, the end was lackluster, the first half was not really great and as a whole, for the main theme, the movie lacked depth and meaning. However, it is entertaining(though a lot of people might said it's boring), the acting is overall decent and they built the atmosphere well, and the second half is truly remarkable to me, so It's a fine movie overall. I'll give it a 7 which I think it's kind of generous to be honest. Let's say it's 6. something"
" Interesting psychological study
",0.4019,-0.6369,2020-10-06 00:00:00,6,"Enjoyable topic with a room full of people who witness a machine killing them one by one.This kind of film doesn't need much explanation, and in the end the characters were well presented and the plot moves on until only one survives the trapped prison room.Out of a series of these kinds of movies I am watching right now, this was one of the good ones.6/10."

" A total bore fest
",-0.25,-0.7485,2020-09-25 00:00:00,4,"""What do you think happens when we get down to last person left?""Over the years there have been plenty of horror movies that involve playing a game or deciphering a puzzle . Saw is the most famous and the best of the lot and there are films like Cube and The Platform that deserves a mention as well , but there are also as many bad films of this genre and Circle definitely fits into that category.In a massive, mysterious chamber, fifty strangers awaken to find themselves trapped with no memory of how they got there. Every two minutes, one of them must die... Executed by an electrical pulse generated from a source within the chamber.The idea for Circle definitely had promise . A group of people voting someone to die ever two minutes certainly is imaginative but in practise it's incredibly dull to watch.90 minutes of people just standing in a darkened room arguing with each other is not my idea of entertainment.
The people on show were all annoying. Every one of them . I'd have been quite happy if they had all decided to jump off their circle and committed mass suicide, at least then I would have had to witness this bore fest .It tries far too hard to be a social study of what people think of each other and forgets that it's actually meant to be a Horror film.
All it needed was some imagination , some decent special affects and better writing and this could have worked but they didn't even know how to the end the film with any clarity which made things even worse.If you are thinking of watching this - Don't bother."
" Good concept, somewhat poor execution
",0.024,0.8273,2020-09-23 00:00:00,6,"First 3/4 of movie were pretty good even if it was somewhat flawed but nether the less kept me entertained. However the movies ending was rushed and poorly executed and raised more questions than it answered and left you thinking "" Really is that it"" but overall it is still a fun and tension filled movie."
" Refreshing and Engaging
",0.34,0.8504,2020-09-18 00:00:00,7,"While the acting was mediocre, the concept of the movies was stellar. It dives deep into what we as a Western society value. While, the ending was unexpected it felt like a cliffhanger with a lot questions still unanswered. An outstanding film what have answered our questions in a subtle and nuanced way. However, we do not know the purpose behind The Circle. What happens next after you are left standing? Who is behind this experiment?"
" Perfect For Election Year
",0.5719,0.8183,2020-09-10 00:00:00,9,"Okay, so there's (almost) no blood, gore, jump scares, or whatever. It's probably the necessarily high body count that placed ""Circle"" in my horror lineup on Netflix. But damn, do they touch on a whole lot of salient political issues whilst deciding who lives and who dies in this advanced technology-Saw-style alien(?) conference room of death.
Differing ideologies are given a fair shake and not criticized outright by the narrative, although the characters criticize plenty - as in real life. You might, as I did, spend the first half wondering why they don't collectively protect the pregnant girl and the child, but the eventual explanation is pretty elegant and understandable, although I still will NOT endorse their thinking.
In all, it's a pretty solid psychological and political flick that induces a helluva lot of self-reflecting on one's own values and what-ifs? Plus, pretty much the entire room gets eventually killed by some sci-fi device that's never properly explained, so... ding!ding!ding!
Absolutely worth the 90 minutes."

",0.0,0.8271,2020-09-01 00:00:00,3,"It started off interesting and with the characters asking relevant questions, it was compelling at first. However, the movie is all just a ""50 track trolley problem"", where the writer(s) show off their morals. The acting is abysmal and none of the characters are likeable - perhaps due to none of them having a name. Perhaps the only interesting aspect is how the story turned out compared to how it would based on ones own morals. But since the movie clearly has an agenda, the outcome is very predictable..."
" Great psychological thriller
",0.6705,0.9493,2020-09-01 00:00:00,7,"Well acted, good dialogues, nail-biting and kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. And oh my god, what a great and smart twist. It would be an 8 if it weren't for the kinda dumb last 30 seconds. But overall a great movie, must-see for lovers of the thriller/horror genre. 7.5/10"
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.8776,2020-08-28 00:00:00,2,"Just finished watching this for the 3rd time, not because it's a good movie. But because I couldn't remember what it was about and if I liked it or now.
I've come to a realization that I couldn't recall the plot because this movie is unbelievably terrible that my brain thinks it isn't worth storing in my head space.I gave it 2 stars bc of the interesting plot, but everything else was pure crap
Worst movie I've seen."
" Very interesting and genious discussion
",0.4576,0.9944,2020-08-17 00:00:00,8,"So. The generous idea of the film is genious. Yes, its simple and a bit stupid, but it offers a great way to make a discussion about nowadays problems, like racism and homophobia.While it might appear as a short movie, it has a length of 87 minutes, which is in my opinion right the perfect time. The premise might have been a better short movie, but i think the writers made a great job of making this a 85 minutes straight-up almost-fifty-people-discussion. Thats a hard job. They geniously put (almost) fifty people in a circle. You cant just pick a few who discuss everything. And thats what they succeeded at. They made (almost) every person in the room a human individual human.But. There are some elements which i find confusing. Why Aliens? The whole storyline of it being aliens is just useless and provides nothing at all to the plot. In my opinion they just could have cut the last scene, because it appears as a ""happy-end""-ish end. An open end of Eric being the last person seen and we just hear the sound of the laser would be a much better end.Here some personal factors: I love movies, that just play in one room. In this case the whole movie (except for the last scene) plays in the circle-room. Before i saw the movie i thought they might add some flash-backs, where we see the pasts of the people, but i loved the decisions that they did not do that and let the movie have a length, that most likely is the actual length of the happenings.
Plus, it might look confusing, because we have fifty people discussing, but in the end we know the persons, that were in the circle. Thats a huge thing, that they somehow got to make almost fifty people relevant in a 80-minutes film.So: Great one-room-discussion with (almost) individually important individual people, who have to discuss who dies. The script is very interesting and providdes many modern themes, like racism and homophobia. Although the premise could have been a way better short film, the film itself is fast-pacing, hardly gripping AND it makes us think about what we would do in a situation like that."
" Flat, Boring Social Commentary
",-0.3182,0.6875,2020-08-15 00:00:00,2,"This film never really gets going. Doesn't allow you to truly invest in the characters and wastes what could have been a pretty interesting concept.Maybe cutdown to about 25-30 people instead of the opening 50 and go from there. The ending is a downer and was pretty obvious as it dwindled down. I won't spoil it here, but the final ""twist"" didn't make any sense at all."
" Unique. Original, a excellent movie!!
",0.7639,0.8933,2020-08-10 00:00:00,8,Not a barn burner or a gore fest or really a horror movie it's a thriller and it's a fun movie to watch. I liked the whole scenario and even the ending so relax and enjoy a quiet decent thriller!!

" Wasted time
",-0.4939,0.2023,2020-07-24 00:00:00,1,Again I think this is another example of friends and family highly rating a film - rather than being based off compete strangers watching this.A total waste of time.Just by the way the people are dressed you already know 20 minutes ahead of time what they will say - social commentary......yawn.Nothing makes sense and the film gives you the feeling of sitting in an auditorium watching an acting class in los angles.
" ""Death Game: Round Edition""
",-0.5994,0.8051,2020-07-24 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and can recommend if you're okay with on screen death and philosophical debate or game theory.
(Think ""Saw 2"" with no gore.)It is always impressive when someone creates a good movie that occurs in a single location.Under the premise of alleged aliens abducting group of people forced to play a death game, we get to see what humans intend to do without authority in a structured environment. This movie is very ""Twilight Zone"".It's hard to cast for 50 ""leads"", and the ""leads"" kind of shift and rotate about during the game as people become targeted, but most of the actors in the game give a serviceable delivery in their roles, and while the production value is definitely there, you can tell that there just wasn't much necessary past the set and the kill mechanism. Hell, this looks so affordable, you could probably turn it into a regular show: there are party games with similar concepts.There isn't much to say without spoiling other than this is a lot of talking: literally discussing who should live and who should die.While I find such things fascinating, other people may want to watch romance or explosions, and there are plenty of those movies out there too."
" Gripping
",0.0,0.9212,2020-07-21 00:00:00,10,"I was on the fence for awhile about watching Circle. I finally gave it a chance tonight and it was definitely a treat!
It's a psychological sci-fi thriller that keeps you in suspense & keeps you guessing.
It's definitely thought-provoking & a small sample of how people may react in a life-or-death situation.
I thought it was an intriguing & gripping plot.
I had no problem with the ending as some reviewers here claimed they had.
It's basically a psycho-social study of human behavior. Loved it! Highly recommend!"
" Leftist Propaganda In a Space Ship
",-0.25,0.8287,2020-07-16 00:00:00,2,"This is a similar concept to movies like The Belko Experiment and The Cube, maybe even somewhat like The Platform as well (all of which are good movies) except this one inserts WAY TOO MUCH political commentary in nearly every word, and its left leaning messages are extremely heavy handed to the point my eyes may have left permanent marks in the back of my skull from rolling back in my head so hard and so often. I give it a couple points for originality, and I am only doing that because I feel generous. Also, side note: if you want the audience to be on the edge of their seat, you need likeable characters so the audience can worry about them. Also, the acting is terrible."
" A dirty mirror reflecting society
",-0.4404,-0.7313,2020-07-13 00:00:00,2,"Circle (2015) is an existential conversational film - or at least it tries to be.
Compared to other movies shot in one room or in one place which emphasize dialogue (12 Angry Men) or other horror-ish movies placing a bunch of characters in traps and borderline situations (The Cube, The Platform), it is not all that well shot and the dialogues are not all that well written.
Nothing that happens doesn't affect anything - there is basically no build-up. The main focus is placed on sociological themes directly expressed in dialogues. There is no mystery and very little tension.
The movie tries very hard to reflect modern society - but this reflection is very foggy and sloppy."

Although this one intruduces further social complications and dynamics. What I truly love about this film is that it introduces the absolute reality of humanity in these situations. It is discomforting because people would rather ignore their social shortcomings and basque in their vindication. Welcome to the ride. And remember this film when you fell justified when firing an employee or wronging someone. It hurts to admit to ourselves doesn't it, well then, where is growth."

50 people in a circle, don't know how they got there and every 2 minutes someone gets zapped and dies. Talking seems to be the only way to get through this... So this sounds interesting and it actually is. It will keep your eyes and ears awake and luckily its not a long film, so it never becomes dull.
If you are having a movie night and plan to watch 3 movies, then watch this one in the middle. 6/10"

",0.0,-0.9722,2020-05-30 00:00:00,1,"This is a fairly boring movie, a bunch of people wake up in a trapped in a strange circular room and are rapidly picked off one by one. However they find out fairly quickly that they get to vote off who dies next. I am really confused by this point because only three or so people where picked off before they noticed.There isn't any build up of character development before people start dying. There is no one main character ever determined which is a shame and led to mediocre acting.There are a few more negatives worth mentioning. One is that some of the kills were too random, this movie showcases American Arrogance at its finest. Killing all the old people first is a poor example of survival. Not killing the woman who started to step off the platform showed they wouldn't get impulsed for moving so all of them should hand stepped off at once. Also the ending was a bust, so much so that it ruined the movie.Overall this is a boring movie and isn't worth the time of day to watch. People on here comparing it to Cube and Saw must not have watched Cube or Saw. Waist of time do not recommend to anyone."

It made me feel physically uncomfortable to witness how truly impersonal a movie can be.Edit: I originally rated this one star but having had some time to cool off and think about my emotional state, I didn't give it enough credit. Horror movies are supposed to get a rise of emotion out of the viewer and now that the emotions are subsiding I can see that the movie made me think deeply afterwards.

This one... is great but it's just something wrong about it.My biggest problem with this movie isn't the acting... it's the number of people in ""the game"" it's too damn many. In SAW, Cube, House of 9, Breathing Room and other movies like this there are maybe 10 people in a trap total. This movie has like 50 in a circle. The problem is in the other movies there is a lot more mystery, suspense, and each character is unique with a personality and a story that slowly unravels over the movie.

It was a good guessing game, where you were actually involved in the process. The characters were surprisingly developed.I won't give away the story much. It's about a group of people in a room that cannot move from their position. They one by one end up dying, if they make the wrong move or don't discover who the bad person is.I don't remember the reason they keep dying, but it's definitely a fun ride. It gets boring in parts.

" A round table version of Survivor.
",0.3612,-0.9887,2019-11-16 00:00:00,5,"50 people wake up in a strange room standing in 2 concentric circles around a central dome. Any attempt to move off their own circle or touch another person near them results in a large buzzing sound, indicating that any such movement is not allowed. After the group realises that they can't move a loud pulsating tone is heard and the dome emits some kind of electric charge killing one person randomly. The same thing happens roughly every 2 minutes, until the survivors begin to realise that they can vote for who they want eliminated next.
Apparently each person is only able to see their own vote. Several attempts are made to circumvent the voting method but the system manages to correct itself by killing 2 people to overcome any stalemate or by killing the person who came up with the idea. They also work out that you are not able to vote for yourself, but you can sacrifice yourself if you step off your circle.As the process continues, human nature begins to slowly take over as people begin to vote for who they consider elderly, those who have led morally questionable lives or those who have biased or socially objectionable values or opinions, such as racism and various prejudices. As the group is slowly whittled away alliances are formed in order to hold on to a few more precious minutes of life as they try to figure out where they are and why. Several people also seem to know each other via various means.After some people vaguely remember being abducted while trying to flee the city, they deduce that the whole thing is alien inspired and controlled, and the why, seems to boil down to a test in how humans think and regard life. Other remaining people regard this as some kind of end of days rapture. The remaining small group decide that either a young girl or a pregnant mother should be the last survivors, however as it comes down to the final 3, the girl steps off her circle and commits suicide, leaving only one guy and the pregnant mother. The guy suddenly changes his mind. He votes for the mother and she is killed, however a stalemate is created between him and the unborn baby, who's still considered a living participant. The final result is not revealed until the guy wakes up in the concreted L.A river. He sees several large circular spaceships hovering over parts of the city and he walks up to a small group of people watching the ships and it ends.Overall this wasn't too bad, considering that this all takes place in one room and it's mainly people talking, justifying their own reasons as to why certain people should live while others should die. Killing off the elderly, those who don't have families or those of questionable views. It's interesting to see people's viewpoints which are nearly all biased depending on their own background or upbringing. However the main sticking point with me, is that none of this is really explained. If this is some kind of alien experiment into human nature, then the process seems counterproductive to the results. Killing 49 people, one every 2 minutes based on their own unique views of who ""deserves it more"" is excessive and a waste of resources. They'd get the same results if they just tuned into any ridiculous episode of Survivor or TV courtroom drama, the winner is generally always the most ruthless, most cunning and who can present the best argument, not the most deserving. So after expending a great deal of time and energy on this experiment, the results and the ending are somewhat ambiguous, other than desperate people can't be trusted. It's an ok film, but needed some fine tuning to wrap up the plot properly."

" Fives short review
",0.0,0.9928,2019-09-17 00:00:00,8,"Circle takes place in a dark red room with fifty strangers. With no memory of how they got there, they wake up in a circle and try to figure out what's going on. Soon they learn that a strange device kills one of them every two minutes and as a group, they can decide who will be the next to be killed by vote. The question is who should die next?
The movie plot is very simple and easy to understand, but that's not bad at all! When the movie starts you don't know anything about the characters and you quickly feel like one of them. With every minute and every new vote you learn a little bit more about them. They all have own personalities, moral thoughts, feelings and everyone thinks different in this situation. So you don't have to expect big things like in an action movie or a blockbuster, because this movie is all about the well written dialogues. During the movie you will have a few favorite characters and some hate characters, because you will like or dislike their opinions. So the movie deals with many philosophical questions for example about politics, religion, equality or moral sense. This scenario is the reason why it is exciting to watch the movie further. The movie length of 87 minutes is perfectly fine not too long or too short. Camera, sound, and location are also fine but not something special and the cast also do their job well.
One negative aspect is that sometimes these two minutes feel really short, so not all characters can talk. But that's not a big point to mention because there are too many characters.
In the end I can RECOMMEND this movie everyone who likes simple stories with good dialogues and dealing with philosophy about the human being.
But I DON'T RECOMMEND this movie if you don't like to see how people just standing there and discuss or just want more action instead of many dialogues.Have a nice day!"

It seemed kind of pointless and simply bizarre.What I DID like is that there was absolutely NO reason given for the antics. This entertained me greatly throughout.If they get zapped, do they actually return to earth? What if they AWL stepped off at the count of three...? Are the aliens gambling on who is next...? (This gets my vote.) Did the aliens finally figure out that we are worse than any other parasite (termites to wood, for example) and this is like using the magnifying glass in the Sun, except with taser capabilities...?I read a few of the other reviews, and quite frankly, I didn't think the one who got to live was human at all. I didn't think anyone (human) was getting out alive, it only made sense that an alien was among them and was picking them off one by one for the sheer entertainment of it...Sure, every person who had a moment in the spotlight obviously is supposed to represent SOME group or another...I guess that was the morality buzz upon which we were meant to chew upon, but I like my idea best: Gambling for Aliens.I was VERY surprised that it was able to stay afloat for so long.

The emotions were strong and the dialogue was greatly executed. I wasn't sure what to think of it off the start with how quickly it jumped into it, but the more I watched the more intrigued I became.Something about putting people in the situation brings out the worst in people, leading to more than enough racist remarks and such which was a bit cringe-worthy to me, but overall the movie was fantastic, suspenseful and super unique."

The best thing going for this film is its concept and its pacing. The constant pressure of time keeps the ""story"" moving forward at a brisk pace, and it doesn't seem to drag.However, that's where the positives end. The setting looks nice, but there is never any change in lighting or shot composition, and it never provides anything more interesting to look at than the singular room the film takes place in.Next, we move on to the script itself. The dialogue is not the worst I've seen, and there are some elements of realism in how the characters act that I can appreciate, but every attempt at social commentary is laughable and lacks all nuance.Then we get to the worst part of this entire experience, the acting. My god, many of these performances had me laughing out loud with their high school drama class delivery. While there are a couple of decent performances, most of the actors do not belong in front of a camera.As a sci-fi movie: uninteresting
As a horror movie: boring

Yeah, from a nihilistic point of view, all lives are pointless. But, are all lives equal? Would you equate the life of say, a racist person, with someone else who had subjectively more ""good"" deeds?This movie tries to say a lot about human nature. I'm not sure if it got it all correctly (we'd have to do the real thing to actually know, and I hope we never do that) But I give it 9/10 and my first imdb review because well, I was so immersed in the story that I didn't think to check my phone once during the whole thing.

Maybe they were purposely woken in a calm state ? Everyone took turns speaking but I couldnt imagine at least one mass argument early on. Otherwise I really enjoyed this movie and even the end since it made sense and it was fair - he made it out fair and aware regardless of the means. I was a bit confused by the very last scene; were the survivors representive of a whole or were they just the obvious choices? Was he concerned that he would be found out or was he feeling guilty?

The ending was a bit open, but I think we saw Earth being saved from overpopulation by aliens... only the fittest 2 percent survives (of course the winners of this Weeding of Weaklings could as well be meant to be slaves or food for aliens as well, but it would not be so horrifying than the well-meaning saving of the ""best"" of the human population).

While these are all fascinating topics and can cause the viewer to invest in certain characters more so than others, there is no real point to this movie.

These strangers are forced to play a difficult game in which they must choose one person from among them who they feel deserves to live or die.The catch is, the futuristic game is powered by the stranger's vote, and they are forced to play a round every two minutes. Our strangers must pick someone at each round, otherwise someone will chosen to die by a electrical pulse when the Circle's chooses at random. Who will be the sole survivor? What lengths will people go to in order to survive? Many will plea for their life as to why they should be kept alive and yes, some acting at times can come across as a tad corny.The Circle without a doubt is a very clever film considering how the film has been completed with a low budget. Even though the fifty characters here are strangers, the film makes it easy and obvious as to what type of people they are based on the way they are dressed or their dialogue. Because someone dies every two minutes, the film also makes moves a quick pace and never feels dull or slow. I personally was very interested to know the film would end because as people were dying frequently, the film continually builds up, up and up to its ending and climax.Circle also has many different types of characters and it's interesting to find out if they will live or die. Some of these characters included:
* A Pregnant Women
* A young Child
* A Police Officer
* An Army Officer
* Old People
And the list goes on...Because this is a low budget film there no major jaw dropping Sound effects or motion picture soundtrack. Other than the suspenseful electrocuting sound, the Audio here is simply the Dialogue and thankfully it is clear.Overall the Circle is a low budget film that can be appreciated for creating something unique with a clever story. The film never feels dull during its duration. Its biggest down point for me was the film's final conclusion. Sure, it's an ending, but I couldn't help feeling as though I wanting a little more information. The ending came across as slightly confusing and I partly misunderstood it at first- another 5 mins of story could have done the film more justice.5.6/10

" Surprisingly Gripping Sci-fi and Study of Humanity (Potential Vague, Light Spoiler)
",0.2023,-0.9229,2018-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Fifty people wake up in a room they don't recognize and are randomly killed off in an alien ""game"" of sorts that they must try to figure out how to outsmart before time is up for each of them. I'm a sucker for this kind of movie, for the ugly side of humanity reveals itself in all forms, and it is fascinating to witness.Most of the actors here are relative unknowns; I recognized one of them from another indie title. Despite this, they were all ""fairly good"" to ""excellent"" in their portrayals of moral ambiguous (if sometimes stereotypical) characters. Some of them never get a word in as the people race to figure out what's going on in the beginning, but others are developed quite nicely over the course of the film. A few of them mold from sympathetic to unlikable and back again as backgrounds, lies, deceit, and biases are revealed. Like another review mentioned, there is never a true ""main character"" of the film even up to its ending, which keeps the viewer on their toes as they try to figure out which character will live through to the end.About 50% of the way through this movie, it was apparent that many of the remaining characters were stuck on the standard ""women and children first"" mentality, and that disappointed me because it is so predictable, overdone, and born out of a sense of misguided righteousness. The movie makes it pretty clear that two characters in particular are relatively safe--and given that these two characters are the obvious ""safe"" choices, I started to get irritable when anticipating the ending. Granted, some characters decide to group together and vote these two ""safe choices"" off to save themselves, but twists and turns abound to undermine them until I was ready to roll my eyes at the final choice and say, ""Of course."" Then, Circle pulled the rug right out from under me. A potentially predictable and faux ""happy"" ending was quickly and brutally massacred to pave way for a morally ambiguous and twisted view of humanity, and by God was I so happy with this choice. Another reviewer mentioned that such an ending should not exist based on who was killed off and how because it was ""upsetting"" for them--but that is the POINT of movies such as these. No happy ending can or should exist, for the entire movie was about people judging each other and killing each other off for petty reasons to save themselves. In the end, if we are to believe true equality exists, the person who lives had just as much right to live as those killed off just before them regardless of whether the choices made were ones we'd make ourselves or not. Bravo, Circle, for choosing the ending that made sense with such a grimy concept and killing off those society deems untouchable in media.Circle was one hell of a ride, and the ending was just icing on the beautifully corrupt cake. Survival of the fittest was certainly displayed here, and the fit are rarely the innocent. This was an easy 8/10 for me, and I will be showing this to my husband next. I just finished watching it, but watching it a second time while knowing the twists and turns is something I'm already looking forward to."

" A rather genius political commentary.
",0.0,-0.9952,2018-09-03 00:00:00,7,"My title may be somewhat confusing, how is this political? After watching this close to 5-7 times, you realize how morality, social standing (doctor and priest), ethnicity (Mexican man who can't speak English), contribution to society (the lesbian), age (teen at the beginning, and the child), family (married couple with a kid), health (cancer survivor), and everything that makes a person who they are is put into choosing someone to die.Of course if you have to choose on who you'd kill it may not be the same as what the characters chose, but except you obviously wouldn't kill the pregnant women, the cancer survivor, or the kid. Those three characters are seemingly the most innocent right? Because the kid is too young, the pregnant woman counts as two people, and the cancer survivor has been through a lot. Those are seemingly obvious decisions, but you see what I mean? This movie is about how we view those experiences and how much weight they hold into who should die, or the more important part of the movie, who should be the only one to live?Another genius part of this movie is how important the votes are, this is stressed CONSTANTLY, especially towards the end, we see how sides are being formed specifically around the kid and woman, and the overarching want to live (which is stressed by the banker and the long-hair/beard guy) how each vote matters, when the woman switches her vote from the kid to the banker, she's questioned about it, and morally to the viewer she seems in the right. Should a kid be killed over an old dude whose been rude for the past ten minutes? Depends on how you look at it. And near the very end of movie, when there is just 6 people left, it also shows how much not voting affects us, when the guy who doesn't talk decides not to vote, someone died instead of both the little girl and the 'phony wife' dying, which at the end of that vote, creates a majority between the Guy, pregnant woman, and the little girl.We also see some more vague options, near the very beginning of the movie when the teen tells everyone to be quiet, he offers a solution, at least a temporary one, kill the old people first. This plan is followed through until his death/the realization of the Cancer Survivors age. Which shows something, experiences are more important than age, which throughout the whole movie is actually void as the refusal to let the kid die is shown throughout the movie.My thought about political commentary is also due to the realization of Eric, ""they"" want to know what's important to them, to US. US meaning as a people, as a country, what makes someone worthy of life. The ending also speaks dividends on morality, as the saying goes ""Karma's a rude person"", once he talks the little girl into a sacrifice he votes the pregnant woman to death, and then the unborn child gets revenge on him, but (to me) it's unclear if his vote went through, or he woke up in a dream. Either way, it's a very revealing ending, that looks can be deceiving and that humans have ulterior motives, if we are trying to help something, it will probably benefit us in some way (image, wealth, or living)."

" An intriguing, well-made film: Waiting for Godot meets The Weakest Link
",-0.5106,-0.9605,2018-06-25 00:00:00,8,"Let's first of all say that this isn't the sort of film I'd ordinarily watch, and I started watching it by accident after searching Netflix for 'The Circle', which a friend had recommended to me, starring Emma Watson, Tom Hanks, Karen Gillan among other well-known actors. 'Circle', however, contains no one famous. It became obvious pretty quickly that I was watching the wrong film, but something about it kept me interested. For all intents and purposes, it looks like a horror, which I don't usually like, but it's not remotely scary and is better described as a psychological thriller. It's not really that either - there's no action. In fact, the entire cast spend the entire film standing in a circle (and around in a circle) until they get killed off, whereby they disappear. Their deaths come at the hands of a mysterious orb thing in the middle of said circle that zaps them and they collapse. Not gruesome or gratuitous at all.The best way I can describe is a combination of 'Waiting for Godot' meets the quiz show 'The Weakest Link'. Consequently, it defies easy categorisation, but it wastes no time in establishing the theme that lasts for the whole film: a group of fifty men and women (and children) from all different walks of life wake up to find themselves in a circle faced with a machine that will kill one of them every two minutes. The twist? They get to anonymously vote for who gets killed. 
I know from having done a fair amount of amateur dramatics that one of the hardest things is being on stage without any lines. It's easy to act when you've got something to say and people to interact with, but just standing there having to react to everything while getting little to do yourself is hard. It's a credit to this cast, the majority of whom are completely unknown, that they all put in solid performances. Few characters get much more than a handful of lines each, and several get none at all, yet each of them feels like a real person with their own history and personality approaching their predicament in their own way. As the characters figure out how the weird death chamber operates, leaders, and later factions, gradually emerge and facilitate discussion among them. How should they decide who gets killed next? One character proposes that the old people should go first - they've already lived their life - while others vehemently disagree: why are their lives less valuable? Another character notices that many of the people who get killed off early are black; others accuse them of 'playing the race card'. The film, ultimately, is a discussion on how we value life. Is it possible to quantify the value of life? Is a pregnant woman really more valuable than a childless person; couples more valuable than singles; white-collar workers more valuable than blue-collar workers; children or the elderly? It's a topical film when we as a planet are facing chronic overpopulation and resource shortages. Debates around euthanasia, for example, often bring up the slippery slope: if an old person gets sick, isn't it just easier to kill them ('euthanasia') rather than invest time, effort and money into caring for them?
It thinks it's cleverer than it actually is. While some of these moral discussions are given sophisticated, intelligent treatment, others, such as a conversation around race, are clunky and feel shoehorned. Also, the fact there are only two minutes between each death means there's little depth and dialogue exchanges are vanishingly brief. Nevertheless, it's a film that I found myself thinking about: what would I do in their situation? How would I play it? I think most people watching it will find themselves siding and associating with particular characters quite quickly, whether they would admit it or not. 
It's a great film for starting discussions. I watched it with a few friends and we spent quite a long time talking about this, and while the film itself may not be overly deep, you can build on that in your own time. It's not perfect: the ending leaves a lot to be desired (though could set up a sequel), some deaths feel completely random with little rhyme or reason (like the script writers couldn't think of one), and because the film attempts to cover just about every facet of society it does feel a little thin rather than focusing on one or two topical issues. The bottom line is I found myself really engaged in 'Circle'. It's a great example of what filmmakers can achieve with limited budgets. 'Circle' features one set, but it's brilliantly designed - striking and sinister. The sound design is equally ominous and adds to the chilling atmosphere. The camerawork and editing is good, and the directors have done a great job with the cast. The last film I watched on Netflix was 'Stasis', which was a painful mess from start to finish, so 'Circle' was a welcome and refreshing change."
" Very Intriguing Plot
",0.0,-0.0793,2018-05-31 00:00:00,6,"The movie starts off with 50 random people waking up in a strange room. They all have to stand on red spots, if they move from that position they instantly die. Every 1-2 minutes one of them dies. Eventually the group find out that they can vote on who dies, and this ensues a deadly wheel of fortune. The premise of the show is very interesting and the way the story progresses is thrilling. There are many different social issues explored throughout the movie as well, some are presented much better than others. Themes such as affluence, racism and what people would do to survive are very clear throughout the film.This is not an A-Class film however. This shows. The cinematography is not that great, the technological aesthetic isn't very appealing, the dialogue can come off as very fake and the acting is mediocre to awful. Altogether this is a pretty interesting film and could be put on in the background whilst doing another activity (as it's mostly dialogue)."
" Better than expected but room for improvements
",0.5994,0.9767,2018-05-29 00:00:00,5,"Circle delivers exactly what is says on the tin and launches straight into the drama from the beginning. The idea is simple and hardly original (it felt very similar to Would You Rather, released in 2012), but it did keep my attention. Despite not knowing most of the cast (except Julie Benz), the performances were strong and the interactions between the characters felt authentic. More could've been done to provide back-story and insight into the characters, but the anonymity of the characters was in a sense a main component of the story because it placed everyone on an level playing field. What movies like this are great for is posing questions about humanity. Most of us consider ourselves to be good, moral people that believe in justice and equality, but when it comes down to a life or death situation how many of us would compromise our belief system in order to stay alive? It's an intriguing thought and it's what makes this movie interesting. I saw a previous reviewer comment that some of the decisions that were made throughout the movie didn't always make sense, and part of me thought the same at certain points (it seemed people jumped on the bandwagon and decided to execute someone just for speaking out), but considering there's a 2 minute time-limit on their decisions, it's understandable. It's fast-paced and pressurised from the beginning and personally, I think the characters behave in a very realistic way. They panic, find ways to cheat the system and survive and eventually accept that whether they like it or not they have to play along, so start making hard decisions on the basis of their personal beliefs and morals. In most instances, the choices of who is killed is fitting and understandable. What lets this movie down is the ending. It's a very intense movie all the way through and the ending leaves you feeling incredibly...deflated. I would've found it more satisfying if there had been a specific reason/purpose for the circle and a much better explanation than what we got. By the time it reached the end it really felt like it had all been for nothing. In addition, I think more development on the characters could've enriched the story. Similar to Saw, how each character is chosen because they've committed an immoral act, it would've been more interesting if each character was in the circle because they'd done something terrible and therefore in a sense deserved to die. Overall, I've seen much worse movies than this. It sustained my attention and nowadays, it takes a lot for a movie to do that. However, if more originality and thought had been put into the creation and execution of the movie, it could've been a 7 or even 8 star rating."

I found this movie very terrifying because I was invested in it. This movie makes you question your own morals and judgement. Everyday people are put in a room, from all backgrounds and upbringings.

" Interesting but heavy-handed!
",0.2828,0.9885,2017-12-12 00:00:00,6,"Fifty people wake up in a dark room, each of them standing on a red circle. Every two minutes, one of them will die-but they soon figure out they can vote anonymously to decide whose death occurs. What would you do if you were forced to decide whether your life was worth more than the person standing next to you? This is the premise of Circle, a sci-fi psychological thriller film released on May 18, 2015. Circle is a movie that takes a generally cliche premise-several people ""locked in a room""-and manages to keep your attention for the film's 87-minute running time, despite the heavy-handed acting and weak ending.
The discussion that goes around the room for the majority of the film is definitely its strongest point. It's incredibly realistic and at times relatable. Some of the things that they were debating about are topics that we struggle to deal with today. Prejudices are revealed as questions of morality are raised. Although we fail to admit to controversial or socially unacceptable thoughts, there is an undeniable fact that some or even most people also feel the same. For example, one man in the film used racism as an excuse not to be killed off. Because of his argument, he caused some people to vocalize their unfavorable feelings toward African Americans. He lives on while the others who were inconsiderate within the debate are chosen to die in the next few rounds. Since his tactics are proven to be effective, it influences others to start similar debates about beliefs and feelings. The threatening environment causes them to be honest about their beliefs and plays a big role on their voting of who should die next. The masterpiece of it all is that the things we may feel in reality or are scared to voice are not only our opinions, but those of others, as well. 
The acting in the movie is decent for what it set out to accomplish, especially since it includes such a large cast. The stereotypical nature of just about every character in the movie both hurts and helps it. It would be difficult for the movie to make each of its character three-dimensional in its short running time, so relying on shortcuts in characterization was perhaps wise. We know instantly whether we should like or dislike someone and something about their background and motivations based on their short character description: ""the Politician,"" ""the Atheist,"" ""the Hippie,"" and so on. At the same time, it's hard to feel empathy for characters whom we know very little about. The movie fails to really invoke much of an emotional response at the prospect of the most characters' deaths. Body after body drops as the film continues on and sometimes it's difficult to figure out why we should care. There are no flashbacks of a time before they were ""abducted"", which contributes to the isolating theme of the movie, but makes the characters' recollections of their backstories fall flat. Throughout the film, many characters express their desire to protect the pregnant woman and the child, which is an easy, but lazy way of gaining sympathy. There are times when the characters feel more like caricatures than people. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to be aware of. If you're looking for a movie with complex characters, this isn't it. 
Circle is definitely a movie that requires you into infer and piece things together yourself as opposed to explaining, especially pertaining to the ending. In the end, one person is set ""free"" but we don't get any real explanation on why. The ending may come as a shocker to most, but if you are a movie connoisseur, then this will not come as a surprise to you whatsoever. The problem is that it fails to do anything really interesting with its premise-the biggest ""plot twist"" of the movie is one that can be spotted rather early on by even the least genre-savvy of viewers out there. Questions are raised, but never really answered, and create a few plot holes. Everyone wants to survive, everyone wants a second chance, and they are even willing to risk the lives of a child and pregnant lady to do so. 
 Overall, Circle is a movie well-worth watching for those die-hard fans of sci-fi and psychological thrillers but only if you are willing to look past the many flaws it seems to have. The ending is perhaps meant to be mysterious, but mostly feels rather unsatisfying and lackluster. The film does succeed at being suspenseful, and although the characters are rather two-dimensional, you'll find yourself cheering them on or booing them nonetheless. In short, Circle is an entertaining movie that perhaps would work better as a thought experiment than a film. With this movie, what you see is exactly what you get.

" A great movie, but not for everyone
",0.3716,0.9903,2017-11-10 00:00:00,7,"First of, this review contains small, unnecessary spoilers, but nothing that will ruin the movie for you.When I first saw this movie, I was surprised about how good it is. It doesn't have a well know cast, and the premise is kinda weird. But the acting was actually pretty good, the characters (the one's that doesn't die right away) is well written and believable. But that said, it's certainly not a movie for everyone. There's barely any action, it's 99% dialog, which some might find annoying, and that's what makes it good. It doesn't try to appeal to the casual watchers, but works more like a movie to make you think. The movie deals with a difficult topic, that we've all probably thought about at some point - How do we decide who deserves to live and die? In that way, it kinda reminds me of Death Note, but without the action, and with more people deciding who can live and die. Besides that, the only flaw with this movie, is how 'surface level' it is. Some of the 'problems' they deal with, isn't well though about and predictable. Of course they talk about racism, sexuality, how children deserves to leave, how the old should die first, who gives more to society and so on. It feels predictable, where it would have been better to deal with other topics that isn't so 'basic'. Besides that, it's great movie for people who enjoy talky movies, with plenty of philosophic questions, but it has it's flaws. 7/10"
" Surprisingly compelling

Who wants to watch a bunch of people in a room working out their conflicts? Especially a movie where I didn't recognize any of the actors?Of course, there have been many *plays* made into movies composed almost entirely of people in a room talking, arguing and emoting - and the movies were fabulous. Oleanna, 12 Angry Men, Glengarry Glen Ross, etc.I found that as time wore on, my interest was piqued enough to make me stop wanting to NOT watch it. Indeed, really wanted to find out what happened at the end, and whether some of the ideas the characters described were true or not.Things I didn't like: some of the characters were ""inconsistent"". Their emotions and reasoning seemed to shift too often to be believable. Ultimately, I'm guessing this was a script issue, but it made the movie a bit less plausible than it could have been. Also, without getting into details, the ending left me feeling a bit unsatisfied.Things I liked: this was unexpectedly entertaining, and it'll leave me thinking about the premise for a little while. I'll probably recommend it to a few people, and that doesn't happen too often."
" Ingenious indie gem gives us a crash course in human nature
",-0.4019,-0.1943,2017-10-22 00:00:00,7,"An extremely effective low-budget antidote to all the leviathan- sized sci-fi movies out there. This places 50 people in a circle and asks of them: who deserves to live and who deserves to die? Such a premise is so simple, it's almost revolutionary.This is a story of morality and how human beings deal with the imminent threat of dying, and it explores the diverse range of reactions, emotions and manipulations that exist on the spectrum. From desperation to condemnation, prejudice to privilege, hysteria to acceptance; there's an honesty at work in how the characters deal with their predicament and choices, and it's often an ugly truth to accept. To the credit of the writing/directing team Aaron Hann and Mario Miscione, they never shy away from showing just how petty and selfish the human race can be.The performances are mostly excellent across a cast of predominantly unknown faces and the script manages to keep up the pace and tension without ever slipping too far into contrivance. Usually the danger of films like this (set in a single location) is that they tend to suffer from either bad production values or run out of ideas towards the third act. Thankfully, 'Circle' embraces its beautifully minimalist style for the better and stays true to its premise right through until the very (bitter) end."
" Almost a good movie
",0.3832,-0.584,2017-10-14 00:00:00,6,"I really want to imagine that this movie was pitched after the writers went through some internet comment forums, took the most common themes of moral argument, re-imagined them in a life or death scenario, and scripted out who would ultimately be left alive. Then the CEO boss people told them that the movie needed some context, and they panicked and chose aliens.Luckily for them I love reading comment wars, so I enjoyed this movie just to hear the people arguing with each other over who deserved to live. I think it could've been a really good movie if they had put just a little more effort into the background story and characters. Although I do think it managed to get across quite nicely how easily we sentence people to judgment based on very fast and surface level interactions.I did think it was a fairly realistic representation of how people generally think, however I did not buy at all that it was how most normal people put in that situation would actually act. For starters, I imagine there would be a LOT more confusion and panic at first and people fainting, puking, and accidentally killing themselves by leaving their circle.

Looking into it a bit more, it is not surprising to find that this was, in fact, the primary inspiration. Something of a modern take on how we judge other people.As a horror or science fiction film, the material is pretty light. But as social commentary, the film is strong. A bit heavy-handed, maybe, or in some ways too obvious in its stereotypes, but still clever just the same. We are left to wonder if humanity was in such a situation, who would survive?

Like many films, it has a good plot and interesting script, but lacks direction. It was as if they got to the end and said, ""You know, let's just throw in some alien overlords with ships that are experimenting on humans, to finish this up."" The ending really ruins what could have been an excellent film.Despite my hatred for most films that take place on one set or in one room, this one had enough believable quarreling and dialogue to keep it fairly tight and entertaining. The social messages were a bit cliché, but I can get over that if it seems somewhat realistic or possible, and doesn't clutter the film up with nonsense for the sake of social justice. This one isn't too preachy, so I can deal with it; I just honestly wanted a more compelling ending or exciting climax-- something other than the tired ""aliens came to look at us"" plot that has now been exhausted."

The premise is quite similar to that of the ''Cube'' or ''exam'', so if you enjoy movies like that, you will surely love this one too!What i really liked about the film was that they did not make everything blatant and obvious, at points you really get fooled, when trying to figure out who is going to die next, most of the times you will get it wrong. All the racial stereotypes and stigmas are incorporated here as there were a wide variety of races and ethnicities in the ''circle'', which really fueled the fire even more when it came who is about to get executed.The ending might feel a little cut off and short lived as people only get a glimpse of what happens when the final survivor finally wins and gets out of the circle, in my opinion they have done this just to have the possibility of creating a sequel, which is very well needed for this film, it had an awesome premise and i feel like they can easily build upon this, making a strong landmark series of the genre, just like the ''Cube'' did. Anyhow, a great little watch for the people who enjoy suspenseful thrillers!"

The largest part is about stereotypes, had bad acting and everybody acted like they were American, which was disappointing. Everybody was screaming about wanting to stay alive and why, while spewing out racist/selfish or just plain ugly things to the people that could vote for them. God came around many times to show his ""head"" and people weren't to happy about the selfish shouters.

Frankly, I am amazed at the number of reviews raving about this cinematic ""circle jerk"" and rating it 8 and even 10. I am guessing that most, if not all, of these positive reviews have been written by people who kicked in a few dollars to make the movie and need to see a decent rating on IMDb to lure viewers.Avoid this movie if the following is important to you as a viewer: 1. the presence of characters who you can feel empathy for or alternatively, despise; 2. a back story of any kind (Christ, even some twisting and warping David Lynch dream sequence) to explain why people are suddenly placed in a situation where they are dying off one by one in some strange, apparently alien-type research facility or spacecraft; and 3. a reason to continue viewing such as you find a character or characters compelling enough to care watching.I am glad I didn't pay money to see the first eight minutes of this but watched it on a friend's Netflix account."
" Engages but doesn't really come full 'circle'! [+52%]
",0.2003,0.9791,2017-08-16 00:00:00,5,"'Circle' is a part sci-fi, part psychological thriller that doesn't serve complete justice to either genre. Fifty individuals are placed in a circle with a voting system that decides who dies every second minute. The film, written and directed (in a minimalist setup) by Aaron Hann and Mario Miscione, attempts to treat social commentary as its core but even after lengthy monologues given by certain characters indicating better layering, the story is driven forward based solely on the decision of ""Who to be killed off next?"".It also doesn't help that the rules of the voting system don't always remain the same; so there's a fair amount of plot-convenience involved when a character demands to be written off. For a film that indulges in a lot of pep-talk, it sure as hell is engaging, to say the least. I for one, noticed the film to peak when individuals conducted interrogations on other individuals than when it took on a more optimistic tone. That said, the horror is in this film is purely short-lived and psychological. There are no scenes depicting gore or human viscera, unlike certain other films with a similar setting. It more or less, tries to convey the notion that the demons are residing within, and reveal themselves only when pushed to certain extremes.The climax is also pretty straightforward. A wee bit of ambiguity would have raised the film several notches above its current status. There were hints of neat twist-packaging at some points, but the outcomes mostly came across as damp squibs. The prejudiced voting strategies followed by the two blocs towards the climactic portions pretty much doused all chances of augmenting excitement levels. Nonetheless, I'd still be excited to see what the directorial duo conjure up next.Verdict: If you enjoyed films such as 'Cube' and 'Exam', this one will partially excite you!"
" This movie will go down as one of my favorite movies of all time.
",0.4588,0.8254,2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"PROS: I'll start off by saying that the movie really did a good job at revealing the truth of human nature in a very raw form. The directors took on a very gripping subject and they were able to move that to psychological horror in a very tasteful way. For me, that's what made the movie. The way the actors were directed to portray certain stereotypes was very masterful and it elevated the tension of the film. With the characters being stereotypical you expected stereotypical actions and reactions, but that's not what happened and that's what made the film engaging. As the watcher I want to be able to sit back and watch a movie that makes me think WITH the characters not for the characters, and that's what movie did so well. The final thing that CIRCLE did that was helpful was that it gave just enough information to keep me thinking about this movie. It answered some question and left others blank, but it left the right ones blank. I came up with many different conclusions that were all spectacular.CONS: The only thing that made this movie a 4/5 and not a 5/5 was the fact that it was portrayed poorly by other movie critic websites. This movie was depicted as a horror movie, which it wasn't at all. This movie does really well at being a psychological thriller, not anything elsewww.chorror.com"
" Boring Circle

Soon the group figures out that they control who is next to die. The rest of the movie is waiting for them to die while they bicker and discuss why they each deserve to live. They don't. Finally one is left and we find out how they came to be in the Circle. By then you won't care. The positive reviews may tempt you to watch but don't do it. You have been warned.
" Amazing premise and build-up. Horrible ending!
",0.1511,-0.9384,2017-07-26 00:00:00,4,"I don't write reviews often. I think this is my second one. I felt compelled to do it for this movie because the final moments are downright dirty.The movie focuses on a group of 50 individuals who are randomly placed in a dark room, supposedly by aliens. Every 2 minutes, an individual dies. However, every person can also vote to kill someone else. The most voted dies, otherwise someone is randomly picked and killed.There is no story but there is obviously a lot of room for ethics and personal values in the movie. Who gets to live and who gets to die, and why. It develops well and quickly picks up the pace.And right when you think you will have a very good and solid movie, it destroys itself in the very end, offering you the most obvious plot-twist available, if you can even call it that. Instead of having the plausible ending happen, which in this sort of movie setting would have been very acceptable in my view, or a completely different and original outcome that was possible due to the elements and mechanics of the movie, we get the most stupid ending possible. The ending is a terrible cliché that automatically hurts the movie itself and all the values that were discussed in it. It is the ending that makes the movie and everything else look obtuse.By the end, I could not help but feel that this movie was extremely cheap. You could say you are offered 87 minutes of thrills and emotions. Just when you think that matters will end properly after a very emotional carousel ride, you are offered the final 3 minutes that can only be dubbed as dull and downright awful - they will make you doubt everything that was put to question in the movie itself. It has its own strengths that just happen to be overcome by its lesser weaknesses and ending combined. If the ending or outcome were to be different, I would have rated this title higher."

For some people who wanted to be thrilled and not to be bored often, then this movie is absolutely not for you but for those people who wanted to learn the behavior of the characters and find out how it all happens then this is for you but I cannot guarantee that it will be like some of the movies that will give you an unforgettable part of the movie.

" God awful, superficial bull trying to hide itself behind some fake stereotypical value system
",-0.5106,-0.9972,2017-07-08 00:00:00,1,"Title says all. Goes around in circles with plot, dialogue, characterisation... If I can even call it that. Let me just say this: a movies 50 or so useless characters can be compressed into as little as 5 then your in for a solid waste of time. What I say through was the script writer or whatever third rate director's decision to have the EXACT SAME three characters and conversations be replayed a literal ten times over (but with a slight change of context). Don't even get me started on the basic if not BAD and utterly fake acting. If you're about to die in a game set by some alien invaders and their ship then please act like so. but back to the characterisation (or lack of). I will outline the three basic characters that appeared in this movie: 1. The supposedly smart id!ot who's trying to figure things out but actually only wants to save his own face, 2. The id!ot who's just honestly only wants to save himself and doesn't even try to hide it by screaming at every other stereotyped victim of society (ie the amputee, the lesb!an, the black man, the priest, the list goes on), 3. The id!ot (they're all id!ots) who wants to save themselves but is too stupid to not blurt out some guilty past as soon as they're asked (I'm talking about the p*rn star and the abusive boyfriend. They were honestly badly thought out). Oh yes I forgot, and there were the victims who said absolute sh!t all and all died an idi!tic death which was both badly scripted and acted out. Basically we have a group of characters who each speak for a total of 2 minutes trying to argue theirs way to survival, before being killed off and replaced by the EXACT SAME character. Yes I know they may all have different occupations and what not, but their two dimensionality and the poor acting kind of destroyed their impact the moment they appeared on screen. Not all films can have 30 main characters. I couldn't even celebrate when the manipulative, evil, conniving, and utterly cliché survivor finally got out of the game. How could I when I barely registered his evil existence. Throughout the whole movie I guess the director was making him out to be some sneaky sleuth, but instead what he became was an utterly detestable and shocking minor character who in the end became a baby killer who by some work of magic (ehem sh*tty plot) managed to survive in order to rant about some didactic superficial bullsh!t before finally showing his oh so evil oh so genius true self. Not to mention the mountain of plot holes and character inconsistencies, along with the cliché bashing of conservative values (in order to seem moralistic) which accumulated thought the movie. Honestly I don't understand what one can gain from watching this mess of a movie. No good plot, no good characters, no good acting, oh and the location. I don't know how I sat through a whole movie (was probably waiting hoping it will suddenly get better. Was wrong.) of 50 plebeians discussing over who to kill off next over and over again in one room. And I say this with the prejudice in mind that YES I did sit my ass down to watch a movie in hopes of finding some decent characters, or acting or even plot. I gained nothing from this. Just acknowledgement and further assertion of the obvious superficiality which has found itself deep rooted in our society. It is after all ""human nature"" (as they liked to emphasise in this film), to be self righteous fake useless twats who go around in circles immitating each other's utter stupidity. Circle. How ironic."
" Circle of Death
",-0.5994,-0.8728,2017-07-05 00:00:00,8,"This movie was very politically reflective. It addressed various issues that people are having problems with in our country today – many areas of prejudice, discrimination and diverse political views – without bringing up politics directly. The very beginning and the very end of the movie tie it together fittingly. The premise is that 50 random people are trying to figure out why they are suddenly in this puzzling room full of strangers and why someone must die every two minutes. It forces each person to look within themselves to make their own personal decisions on how to proceed. There are intense moments when the viewer may get mad and actually want a particular character to die, but as the dialogue progresses, you may begin to wonder why you felt that way and change your mind.It does get a little confusing as to how the voting system works as people begin to kill one another, but that's the only thing I didn't like about it. I loved that there was only one major scene, so the entire movie depended on characters' dialogue and personal opinions of the viewer.I think that people who keep an open mind will appreciate this film."

",0.0,-0.2422,2017-05-07 00:00:00,7,"The first question we have to ask ourselves to understand the film is:How do we know if a person is good or bad?By their socioeconomic status, by their job, by their education, by their beliefs, by their color, by their gender,by their sexual preferences, by their looks, by their charisma, etc. Absolutely not.Goodness is measured by actions.We believe in the power of decision and deception. The film is very interesting and poignant. By nature the human being is envious and will only see for his own benefit. This film shows you the warm and dark face of the human being at the same time. Lies and false hopes, ambition, selfishness and disinterest are the factors that usually stand out and is exactly what happens in the film and is the crude reality that we are living today.And finally the last question you should ask to yourselfWhat would you have done if you were one of the fifty persons selected to participate in the circle?"
" Intelligent premise of human sadism, but regresses to emotion - still tense, well-paced and very absorbing, I love horrors that are named after shapes!
",-0.1581,0.9163,2017-04-06 00:00:00,8,"The most interesting stories for me are based on scenarios that reflect our lives in this absurd society, and the all too overrated human nature we are programmed with. In a century of ignorance, denial, mass brainwashing and baseless optimism, it is all the more refreshing for humans to be presented as almost as ugly as they actually are. This film achieves that, and posits questions of the viewer, who is welcomed by the writers to 'think' like these characters. One is drawn into making perverse judgements, which all but one of the later survivors does, becoming more and more desensitized to each death - though against the clock their reactions must also be economised. Game theory may form the inspiration for this plot. I was expecting there to be a twist at the end revealing how the sole survivor picked the correct play in the correct Nash game, though the film stays with the more visceral emotional behaviour for the most part.This film was always going to score highly with me as it deals with the ugly and flawed human condition - its gang tendencies, outsider persecution, zero sum sadism, job-as-life- value bigotry, and a few of what Wikipedia lists as human biases (important list that all should have to study at school, search for 'list of human biases' or 'heuristics' or similar. Due to the need for the audience to follow, the development isn't quite how it would actually go - there is a charming notion that people would try to work together in such a situation, when many would try to work it out for themselves and keep their 'strategy' secret. Due to the lack of realism in the gang's decisions, which could have addressed some very real current tendencies such as feminazism or misandry, Circle isn't going to score a 10 or 9. What would actually happen here is that people would vote on their prejudices - namely, 'women and children first' and 'kill the younger males' - which would leave the group with just the people you see on all mass media and corporate materials - white female, black female, Asian female, black male, pensionist - and so the long-haired caucasian man with a beard would be the first to be killed by the others - due to societies prejudices. But the ambiguity and lack of these schemas does render Circle unpredictable and with a tense, organic, fresh-reset feel throughout.Like human nature, the scenario is deliciously sick, and sadistically ironic. The turning point of the film, for example, is when one of the characters announces how to play. And the time limit. Instead they could have refused to play the murderers game and thus buy themselves more time - but all bar one - the smartest, who neither speaks nor votes - overlook this.The ending is ambiguous. The survivor, with his words during the game overdubbed as he gathers himself - joins a new group of people. Is he going to play again? What would that make him?Though there are missed opportunities - a review with Game Theory would give it a 9/10, and a review and lesson on the sickness and sadism of human nature or modern feminazi prejudices would give it a 10 - the writers make all these opportunities themselves. They have taken many of them too, and it just goes to show how dialogue, not visuals, are more important for an engaging plot. The acting is also pretty phenomenal, and rarely have I been compelled to want a character to die more than the banker! It does draw you in. Three of my favourite horror/psych thriller films are now named after shapes! Triangle, the Cube, and Circle. Definitely recommended. Note: also recommended in the non-horror genre: The Invention of Lying, due to its wonderful twist on human nature, with a very positive, 'feel-good' vibe and very intelligent writing."

Whenever writers overuse the F word, it tells me that they don't know how to write. I hated this movie and would recommend not watching it. Poorly written, terrible acting, and a plot filled with holes. For instance, at one point, we learn that no one can see who others are voting for. Yet, there is a scene where a man knows who his neighbor votes for. To me, this looked like a high school student made this movie for a school project.

They quickly figure out that they cannot leave their circles and that every few minutes a count down starts, at the end of which one of them is struck dead. They also figure out that they held the power of vote over which one of them is picked.And from that chilling premise we get an expertly crafted movie which explores the depth of human morals and the meaning of life. Blocs start to emerge among the survivors, their votes revolving around the question of who among them deserves to be the last one standing. And through the cut-throat competition we explore those same themes alongside them. And the beauty of the film is that there are no clear-cut answers. Your personal world views are going to colour your expectations and reactions, but in the end the final solution is not about worthiness but rather the something quite different. Which is the perfect way to end such a debate, really.It's an intense film. A person dies every two minutes, and we see the whole game played from start to finish, with one person snuffed out every few minutes. And it is just as brutal as you'd expect. Especially because the cast of characters is so all-encompassing. We have people from all walks of life, from young to old. Some of them are, in our opinion, more worthy of surviving the game than others, but in the end we still have to make some hard decisions. Would you rather save a child or a pregnant woman, for example. A military man or an elderly woman? A police officer or a newly-wed?This is one of the best film experiences I've had in recent years.

It also explores which one will emerge as ""the alpha"" (or simply, the winner) each time a person needs to be killed.What I particularly liked is that this is a very simple movie - the production is simple, and the story setup as well - but it still manages to keep you on the edge.Kept me on the edge until the last moment."
