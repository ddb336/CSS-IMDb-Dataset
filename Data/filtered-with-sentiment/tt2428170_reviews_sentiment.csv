" It's just utterly terrible
",-0.5256,0.4939,2021-03-24 00:00:00,1,"Save your time, don't watch this movie. Instead of 'Creep' it should be called 'Crap'"
" Don't waste your time
",0.3252,-0.7713,2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,This movie was terrible. I cannot understand why this is on a list of top horror movies on Netflix. I wish I would have never watched this. Boring. Terrible ending. Don't waste your time.
" creepy!
",0.0,0.8225,2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,"Wow, I was mesmerized by Joseph's character
His acting is amazing, the character is enigmatic, and the ending is creepy ineed"
" horrible movie
",-0.5423,-0.6331,2021-03-04 00:00:00,1,Worst movie I've ever seen. Joseph is soooo predictable and Aaron is just straight up dumb and doesn't have any will to live throughout the whole movie. I almost guessed every scene before it happened. Don't waste ur time
" Creepy but not scary
",0.5334,-0.9018,2021-02-26 00:00:00,5,"The plot has some potential, a guy is hired for a day to film a stranger. He drives to a remote place not knowing exactly what to expect but he does this for the money. Plausible. There he meets this guy who right away from the start comes of as creepy. Still willing to do the job he was hired to do, he stays there for the rest of the day and plays along with whatever weird thing the guy who paid him wants to do. If he was smart, he would have left a long time ago but he's either stupid or he needs the money (or both). To be honest, it was interesting in the beginning but the vast majority of their day was mostly boring. Creepy cause it's obvious that the guy is a creep but not scary. By the end of the day, I was really looking forward for something interesting to happen but all I saw were stupid decisions made by the filmmaker. First at the cabin and later in his own house. His response to an obviously scary and dangerous stalker is ridiculous. How dumb are you? As a found footage independent film, it's not the worst but as a horror movie it's also not great. I love horror movies that are plausible and scary. This one is plausible but definitely not scary! Although, I highly doubt a guy like that can kill so many people and not get caught plus, if he pays them a 1000 dollars for a day, he must be very rich. So even though it has some potential and the acting and filming are pretty decent as a psychological horror film it falls short."
" Stalker lures a videographer into a truly creepy experience.
",0.4404,0.9685,2021-02-20 00:00:00,6,"I love the idea of a stalker, tbh I found it a little hot at points. Plot felt too long in parts and too short in parts - but maybe just because they perfectly made me feel uncomfortable on the first day? I didn't like how little exposition was given to that day's ending, but it was a harrowing scene I really enjoyed. Both actors did a great job! The ending was okay but could have been a bit more expository. Once the cat was out of the bag, I wish we had some additional final details."
" Wolf Heart
",0.0,0.9757,2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,"It's not the best horror movie released on that year but is possibly the best ever on found footage movies. I love the way it begins with a situation that seems friendly, or better, want to seems friendly and comfortable but there's this acid beneath the dialogues and the character actions. I love also the role that the wolf have on the main character and the story, it's a very important element for understand the nature of the Josef and whatever is on his mind. I think that situation end too soon, and everything that comes after is madness, I would have preferred a slower burn for the tension. Still recommended."
" Just As The Title Say
",0.0,0.7269,2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,This was pretty good and some unexpected bits. A slow moving film.
" 5
",0.0,0.4696,2021-01-28 00:00:00,5,"A bit overrated. It wasn't very good acting, that's for sure. For real, that's how maniac,serial killer,stalker would act, like this guy did. Plot was okay, he wanted to get his victim scared because that makes him happy and after that get rid of it. The only problem I see is that when you see any of Red flat, for example, when he wanted to be filmed in bath naked or go to forest alone with stranger you shouldn't do it and get from there ASAP. I wouldn't recommend to watch it because I found it a bit boring. Maybe two stories would fit better and could make it more interesting and violant to watch."
" Horrible
",-0.5423,-0.2755,2021-01-25 00:00:00,2,It was absolute trash and would not recommend for anyone
" It's creepy indeed
",0.0,-0.9938,2021-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Aaron the charming guy showed up at the house at the top of the hill for the job and he was a weird guy. He said he's cancer and going to die in three months and wanted him to videotape his life so that his soon to be born son will be able to watch him. The bathtub scene was really creepy to watch and then the wolf mask. They went for a hike in the woods to see a heart shaped pool carved naturally in a rock by a waterfall. While they're having their pancakes it was really disturbing how he raped his wife (his sister in reality) with his wolf mask on because he found out in the computer that she's into animal porn and they both acted like nothing happened. They got back creepy house at the top of the hill, Aaron wanted to go but he wanted to commemorate the day with whiskey. Aaron being scared drugged his whiskey and they did bottom up. He fell asleep and his wife and in fact his sister called him and said to Aaron to exit the house because his brother had problems. After their scruffle the camera turned off and it was Aaron again telling he got back home and had his car towed. But he sent packages to his house which means he knew his address. He sent videos of him and a heart locket and inside were there the photos of the two and their initials were caved on the outside of the locket. I felt sorry for him after watching his last video telling how sad and lonely he's and wanted to meet him by the lake in public. Aaron came to the spot and waited him sitting on the bench facing the lake and Josef approached him from behind and killed him with an axe like Aaron confessed he's scared of the axe in front of the house when Josef asked if he thought he'd kill him with it. And then he said Aaron was his favorite because he was innocent. He was on the phone with another person for the job and he opened the cabinet containing his video tape collection with the names of the victims on them and the latest being Aaron with a heart drawn under his name. Josef's creepy murderous wolf love for Aaron was really disturbing to watch and the ending was too abrupt and shocking when he hit the axe in right in his head. I'll definitely watch the sequel soon although I am no so into found footage horror and I guess it kind of changed with this film."
" Best of found footage
",0.6369,-0.8651,2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"This is what found footage horror was made for. The way its filmed and the dialogue is superb, it makes it so natural and that makes it so much more scary. The fact that the movie only contains two people the entire time, also makes it feel like the loneliest movie, and that makes it that much more terrifying.The only negative I can think of is the overuse of jumpscares. The dialogue and the atmosphere makes the whole movie, so the jumpscares can be a little distracting, its just not necessary.Overall a great, short horror movie, one of the best in the found footage genre.7,5/10"
" This movie sucks.
",-0.3612,-0.4685,2021-01-11 00:00:00,1,"Don't watch it.It's disguised as a ""found footage"" movie. It's badly acted. Poorly paced. Terrible all around.Do not waste your time."

Some good acting."
" Started off interesting enough
",0.4019,-0.8974,2021-01-07 00:00:00,4,"It's an interesting concept which was executed quite well, but then the ending just completely ruined it for me.SPOILERS-
The way the main character just sat with his back towards the road, while fearing for his life just wasn't believable in the slightest. I know they tried to 'explain' it afterwards by saying how he's just so kind and trusting, but no. He was filming it, he didn't fully trust the situation. Having him sit like that made zero sense, and the fact that that's what ends up being the death of him is rather outrageous and unnecessary."
" The Best

",0.0,-0.9339,2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,"There are more plot holes and logical fallacies than the actua plotl. Logic does not exist in this movie and anyone in there right mind wouldn't act like the protagonist. How can people like this illogical movie? By the way, Aaron is the worst videographer ever.

The ""found footage"" method has now been totally overdone after the success of Blair Witch but then we get a piece of film like Creep. I picked this out for a quick afternoon watch, not expecting much but on the edge of my seat start to finish. The use of this style was great, the acting phenomenal, and the simplicity added to the suspense. Not to be missed!"
" What a movie!!
",0.0,0.2661,2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"First of all, I liked this movie because of its realism and the way it depicted Josef. Yes, if someone was creeping on you it would be something like that. Josef's way of thinking and reactions made the movie even more disturbed. I was expecting it to be so though and I didn't find it boring. On the contrary, I wanted to see what else he had in mind to do. I totally suggest it to anyone who feels lonely. After this movie, you won't be lonely anymore."

Great job at maintaining a seriously creepy vibe throughout the whole thing. Josef is an awesome character. Really nailed his whole psychology with the wolf metaphor and after the park scene when Josef is talking to the camera; really a great ending! I have such an issue with the b.s. way that most of the recent horror movies seem to ""run out of time"" and end the movie quick and halfass. I would give it 10 stars but I want to maintain hope that there are even better films out there."

",0.0,-0.2732,2020-11-26 00:00:00,7,"The one thing annoying (& that's a major annoying) about this movie is that it is a found footage. That's why im only getting to it almost a decade later. And convenience : it's on Netflix.Who ever was responsible for making found footage a ""thing"" , I have a real serious issue with. Otherwise a real good premise. Ok acting. A good movie overall.Just hate found footage. Absolutely hate it."
" A little known masterpiece.
",0.5888,0.9764,2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"Creep is an incredible experience. To say that I loved this film wouldn't be an exaggeration. It's probably the cleverest found footage film I've ever seen and by quite a long way too.There're only two characters on screen during the film, but they're so developed and well-written, you're kept occupied with their story throughout. Mark Duplass plays Josef, a man who has an inoperable brain tumour who hires Aaron, a young struggling videographer to make a video diary for his unborn son, whom he is unlikely to ever meet. As you can expect from the moment you meet the character, Josef isn't quite who he seems.The film relies on clever plot twists and great acting rather than excessive gore and violence to create suspense which is so rare for a horror movie these days. The ending is fantastic and the whole film just felt like such a joy to watch. It's truly a special film and I urge anyone to watch it and see what they think."
" OH MY GOSH
",0.0,0.9665,2020-11-17 00:00:00,9,"I had first heard about Creep from someone on Snapchat. I thought ""why not, it's on Netflix and it's horror"" so I went straight into it. Today I decided it had been a minute since I had watched it and I resumed the movie. And this was a roller coaster. The plot thickens the further you go on and at the end it's just like ""no thanks"" but you watch the second one anyway. The acting is a masterpiece, I like the tie with the camera, and the many jump scares, added child-ish play to the movie. Great acting all in all would totally recommend."
" One more proof that small budget works well if you have talent!
",0.636,0.8519,2020-11-12 00:00:00,7,"Love found footage style films!Creep is by any means is not the best one,but pretty close to it)!Very simple and very effective story,somewhat little disturbing.Overall-well done!"
" Creepy
",0.0,0.8373,2020-11-10 00:00:00,7,"Creep is a great representation of how to make a found footage film. Mark Duplass gave a terrific performance which was mostly improvised. Although not a super scary film by any means, it was still unsettling and nerve racking. When Aaron was outside his house looking for Josef I couldn't help but to put my hands in front of my eyes and peak through. The best thing is nothing happened, the film is just creepy It doesn't try to do anything but creep you out and keep you on the edge of your set. Although creep is not perfect it still holds up as a very good film. If you are someone who wants their thrillers and horror films to have a bunch of unexpected twist and turns, this is not for you. They don't hide what it is and who the characters are. To me thats what stood out, I would recommend this film."

",-0.6908,-0.8785,2020-10-29 00:00:00,3,"Without going into spoilers, I sat and watched this and as usual with this type of film you just sit there and say ""I wouldn't do that! Why would you do that?! That's so stupid, don't do that.""And the big one: ""If someone acted like that with me then I wouldn't hang around."" And this simple issue affects the core premise of the film. Add on cheap jump scares and it's just DUMB. I forwarded through the last 30 mins as I couldn't be bothered to watch it any more, and it's only a short film in the first place. Avoid."
" Tubby time.
",0.0,0.0184,2020-10-28 00:00:00,6,"At least for its first half, 'Creep (2014)' is essentially just a piece of mostly improvised performance art from Mark Duplass that's reacted to, in an equally improvised manner, by his co-star and director Patrick Brice, who films the affair in a distinctly documentary style. This naturally lends an air of unpredictability and believability to proceedings, as Brice reacts in a totally unbiased fashion to the often odd things that Duplass says and does. This doesn't mean that the overall film is directionless, however; it comes together as a surprisingly complete whole, with only a couple of elements getting caught on their unique execution. The second half isn't as successful as the first because it devolves into much more laboured, plot-heavy and, frankly, generic fare. Its ultimate payoff is rather disturbing, though; in that sense, it sticks the landing. In general, the movie is more intriguing than it is entertaining. Its two-half approach leads to an off-balance pacing, and its general subtlety is more disquieting than distressing and, as such, takes its time to take hold. It's straightforwardly enjoyable on a few occasions, though. Plus, a few of its sequences are, indeed, quite creepy. In general, it's an engaging experience. Even isn't quite as impactful as it perhaps could have been, it's an interesting experiment that mostly pays off. 6/10"

" Adept found footage
",0.0,0.8821,2020-10-27 00:00:00,7,"I do love me some found footage and this one adeptly takes advantage of one reason FF works so well as horror, that reason being the feeling of no safety mechanism in place. It's like putting shock buzzers in the seats for the debut of The Tingler, the feeling that the creep could come walking up your front porch if you don't watch out! This creep is delightfully creepy, to the point that one gets that feeling of being embarrassed for the guy until his creepiness snaps back into normal, or almost normal. I also dig the strange setup for the ffing: the video for his unborn child. The story is that our hero, a struggling videographer answers an ad for a cameraman to shoot a film as a one-man crew. When he shows up he finds the Creep, who gets creepier by the minute."

" A Hell of a Performance
",-0.6808,-0.9971,2020-08-17 00:00:00,9,"This movie is the ""My Dinner with Andre"" of horror.I saw this movie several weeks ago, and have been turning it over in my mind ever since. To me, that's something that makes a horror movie great.Are there plot holes? Sure. Are there parts that are a little implausible? You bet! But who cares when you've got Mark Duplass using his impeccable comedic timing to produce something that's darker than comedy, but wittier than most horror?Duplass carries this movie. No, strike that. Duplass IS this movie. His performance is the only thing that makes anything scary, and it works. His delivery. His mood shifts. His erratic behavior. All of it combines to create an air of menace without actually doing much of anything violent or such that you're not sure if he's really a bad guy or not. By the end, I had more or less concluded that he was, to the point where I found the closing scene somewhat anticlimactic, and I think it's supposed to be that way.This is a movie that subverts most horror expectations. The murder isn't scary. The victim isn't particularly sympathetic (Aaron is okay, but not an especially memorable character.) The jump scares are more comical than truly scary (though still startling) . All of the horror, all of the suspense comes from whether or not Josef is truly capable of doing what we IMAGINE he's going to do. Is he the serial killer we suspect, because this a horror movie and we expect things like serial killers, or is he just a weird eccentric with a penchant for freaking people out?By the time you're reasonably sure that he is, in fact, the bad guy, it almost doesn't matter any more. (And this kinda-sorta becomes the premise of Creep 2.) You've been drawn into his world. You're too fascinated by his psyche to want anything other than to see how it all unfolds.(Image that sticks with me: Josef, with the Peachfuzz mask on, gyrating obscenely against the door, nodding with deliberate menace at the quesion, ""Are you trying to scare me?"")"
" Garbage worth Seeing
",0.2263,-0.4692,2020-08-16 00:00:00,4,"This film totally lacks anything close to a logical storyline and leaves you with nothing but unanswered questions. No real plot to follow, no background information on characters, and as a ""horror movie"" it definitely isn't scary. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it left me curious... curious to see if the second creep movie will be garbage too. I'll be leaving a review on it too if it's this much of a disappointment."
" Won't give you the creeps
",0.0,0.6742,2020-08-12 00:00:00,2,"This 'found footage' film is a waste of your time. Nothing happens for the majority of this film, leading up to an anticlimatic end.
One random dude pays another random dude to film him for the day and makes up BS stories about his life (he's dying of cancer, he's making a film for his unborn son, he put on a wolf mask and raped his wife). He develops and obssession with the guy filming him and briefly turns into a stalker, before luring the camera man out and burying an axe in his head.
Films done on hand held camera are getting very tired and this film adds absolutely nothing to the genre. In fact Creep being a 'found footage' film is almost entirely unnecessary and doesn't help the film in any way.
The characters in this film are two dimensional and woefully underdeveloped. The camera man spends 80% of the film behind the camera (obviously) and we learn practically nothing about the man, so it's hard to care about him. The guy being filmed makes up so much crap that we don't know what to believe. Near the end he sends one last video to his new 'BFF', where he admits he has problems and doesn't know how to deal with them, therapy doesn't seem to work and he claims he just needs someone to talk to. This is done in an attempt to make us feel sorry for him, but the ending to the film undoes this as it's revealed he actually enjoys being a stalker/murderer.
This film is a slow burner which fizzles out at the end. The stalker part of the film is too short and poorly done, making the whole film feel a bit pointless.
The stalker says he really cares about his camera man, but there is very little to make us care about this film."

The thing is we don't like to be rude to people so when someone crosses your boundaries you tend to go with the flow to a certain extent. The videographer did what I would have done for the most part. It will make you question who you trust by the end. I slept with my bedroom door locked tight haha!

",-0.4898,-0.894,2020-08-05 00:00:00,2,I liked the British film from 2004 called creep but this one with the same Title buy Netflix is absolute boring . I'd avoided it since I've had Netflix as I had a feeling it would be low grade. The only reason I gave it a chance is cause it's been given decent score review though I was worried on reading them oh no I wont like it as I realized it was a hand held follow me cam type film which I hate. The victim was a good actor and get the moral story at end but it was just boring & no way would I be that unsuspecting deciding to again go meet a wacko out of pity. I wont waste my time with the second one. Also when he phoned the cops just because he didnt know the guys last name doesnt matter he had his face on video to hand in. Really dont know how this got the score it did
" Don't waste your time
",0.3252,-0.9823,2020-08-01 00:00:00,2,"I've seen a lot of horror movies in my life, and this was by far one of the worst. It was weird and uncomfortable, yes. But a horror is scarier if the character does everything right and still meets their doom. When they walk into bad situations knowingly, it is just frustrating. The tension is contrived, annoying, and pointless because you know they are too dumb to survive anyway. I would rather watch the Kissing Booth than see this film again."
" Wow really creepy
",0.5859,-0.8459,2020-07-22 00:00:00,8,I was on edge the whole movie from beginning to end. The thing I didn't like is why didn't Aaron just show the cds to the police to verify his story. STUPID AARON :(
" It has its moments...
",0.0,0.9762,2020-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Original, admirable, but ultimately muttled and somewhat lacking- Creep seems like it has the potential to be an amazing horror film, but instead settles for average. I have to admit, I did warm up to the film more as it went on, but that isn't to excuse the slow pacing of more than half of it, and its largely forced jump scares. There isn't a whole lot of this movie that I would consider scary, just a lot of weird jump scare moments that pop out at you, seeming to make sure you are still paying attention. It was that reason that I found the film a bit lazy, which was disappointing, because as it got closer and closer to the end, I felt it was at its most interesting point. The unfolding of the character Josef, stalking Aaron in the later portions of the film were far more interesting and creepy to watch than anything it had to offer in the beginning. I understand it had to find a starting point, and I understand that Josef himself was meant to be an odd character, but I can't help but feel the combination of the two plot lines feels oddly uneven, and just wish a little more time was put into making it a more solid and consistent film. The writing in the film, or forced line delivery anyway, seems quite out of place, and very obvious, which really takes away from the whole factor of the film as well. That all being said, I did feel like the actors, namely Mark Duplass as Josef, worked best with what they had. I found the found footage angle for this type of film interesting, but somewhat lacking, and I actually did like quite a few of the shots in the film. Creep seems amateur, and a bit messy, but not a totally bad start. In the end, Creep has some to offer, but ultimately it isn't a very satisfying flick. Creep is not a bad film, but not one I would really want to watch again, and one I feel like could be made better if better filmmakers were involved.

The acting delivered from both ends is believable enough for the big screen, but genuine enough for a found footage documentary. While this film somewhat relies on cheap jump scares, there is a sense of overall terror building up. Soon enough, red flags go up all over the place, but they sit there, screaming at you telling you something is wrong. And you can't do anything about it. The twists and turns this film took let me hooked until the end, and boy did the end deliver in a major way.

" Suspenseful and psychological
",0.0,0.67,2020-06-16 00:00:00,8,"I found Creep to be a very successful horror movie. Not for the few cheap jump-scares here and there, but for the suspenseful and unsettling tone. From the very first 5 minutes I was already hooked on watching it, which was a breath of fresh air as a lot of thrillers have a slow and boring beginning. The antagonist, Josef, was a multi-layered and overall disturbing, giving the movie both its title and an engrossing plot. The protagonist, Aaron, was relatable and likable (sometimes horror movie protagonists can be unlikable and you don't necessarily care too much about their wellbeing). Creep left me utterly unsettled and at the same time impressed that a movie like this doesn't need gore and paranormal activities to be terrifying. And best of all, Josef looks like a normal person (for about a minute or two), which makes it feel more realistic and paranoia-inducing because you feel like people like him do exist in real life and can look like everyone else, which is psychologically disturbing to say the least. Great film, good plot twist, and very riveting storyline. I definitely recommend it to people who love psychological thrillers or horror movies that don't contain blood and gore."
" Good atmosphere but there are flaws.
",0.2382,-0.9663,2020-06-08 00:00:00,5,"This movie was a strange one, original in plot which was great and Marks performance really helped build the deeply uncomfortable (albit sexual?) atmosphere that clouded the movie. There were comedic / cringy moments to sort of ease the awkwardness and the characters felt very isolated; there are no supporting characters seen on camera other than the protagonist and antagonist. The ending was quite solid too, no music just the silence of death.Here are my criticisms though; the jumpscares personally ruined the movie for me. It made the movie feel cheap and at worst, obnoxious. I don't know if it was horror movie hyper-awareness or a personal disconnect but I found the protagnonist's decisions unrealistic, just 1 minute of the antagnosist's dialogue would've had me stepping on the gas to gtfo of there and I'm a shy, overcompensating person. I couldn't imagine anyone having so little intutition that they would stay in an extremely isolated cabin with a mega creepy guy that's constantly touching the subject of death and having literally no other presence in the house despite him claiming to have a wife. All the characters behaviour didn't feel realistic at all, it felt frustrating. If you don't mind all this feel free to watch but I won't be watching the second one. 5/10"

Why didn't I continue watching the film after the 17 minutes line mark? I blew my load too early due to countless jumpscares. Like really, it got to the point where the killer had jumped in front of the camera (just for the sake of it) twice within three minutes. I´m sorry, but I just can´t pay attention to something as stupid as this. Jump scaring for horror is like tickling for laughs: it works if it´s mildly done, but it can get annoying pretty fast. Oh, and I also felt the story wasn´t going anywhere and we wouldn´t get to know more about neither man on the film, so I just fast foward to the end (and I´m pretty sure I missed nothing) because I have more important things to spend my time with."
" Did we all watch the same movie?
",0.0,0.1555,2020-05-09 00:00:00,3,"I just finished watching this movie and I was looking forward to find critics tearing it to shreds.
Apparently I must have watched a completely different movie because the horror masterpiece that most critics are describing has nothing to do with 'the creep'.
This movie has no twists at all, you can tell Josef is not mentally stable from pretty much the very beginning of the film, what's worse, Aaron, the guy hired to record the creep, has no survival instinct he's constantly getting himself into more danger. Instead of running away he stays in the house and looks for Josef. There's a point in the movie where Aaron gets a call from Joseph's sister, the sister asks him repeatedly where he is, yet Aaron apparently has no idea where the house is located even though he drove all the way up there.
There's a point later where Aaron hears strange noises coming from outside his house, keep in mind by this point in the movie he knows he's being stalked and followed by Joseph, still he decides to go outside and check on those sounds. It's not something a real human being would have done there's no logic to any of what Aaron does.
In a nutshell, this movie is really predictable, it has barely any tension and whatever tension it does have, this immediately lost because of all the cheap jump-scares they put in. I understand that to show that Joseph is quirky you make him jump once or twice in front of the camera, but he does this exact same thing about six times all throughout the movie and each passing time it gets more and more boring and predictable. I don't understand why people think this is some sort of masterpiece but it's just you to spend your time watching something more entertaining like paint drying."
" Uncomfortable does not equal Scary
",0.0072,-0.6076,2020-05-07 00:00:00,3,"I did not like this movie at all. I love mockumentaries and found footage. The issue here is that the subject of the footage is really disturbing, annoying and irritating. He becomes menacing as the movie progresses, but no one would have stayed with him long enough for this to happen. No photographer would film this given the premise of the movie.Our lead character is almost impossibly bizarre. He is so exaggerated that I didn't find him scary and I didn't find this movie interesting.Only watch this one for completeness of the genre. There are so many better examples."

" Awkward...
",0.0,0.9805,2020-04-25 00:00:00,6,"""Creep"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch a man accepting a job from an advertisement without knowing a lot about it except only that he will need a camera to film another person and some hours of his time. After meeting the other person and starting filming him, he is observing that the behavior of the other man is very strange and starts questioning everything happened so far.I have to admit that I had very low expectations from this movie but I was happily surprised by it. I am not saying that is a masterpiece but it is a good, creepy and strange horror movie which in many scenes will make you fell uncomfortable but I am sure that you won't stop it because you will want to know what will happen next. The interpretations of both Mark Duplass who played as Josef and Patrick Brice who played as Aaron were very good and I believe they succeeded both on their parts making us feel what they both characters were feeling. The direction which was made by Patrick Brice was good, with much of suspense and plenty of awkwardness."

" the joker (2014)
",0.128,-0.3384,2020-04-18 00:00:00,9,"The actor, Mark Duplass, is essentially creating an acting reel here. The film is highly minimalistic, taking the form of him as Josef hiring a videographer, Aaron, to film video for him to leave for his unborn child as he (claims) he is dying of brain cancer and may not live to see them grow up.
Over the course of the filming, he has a magnificent way of just subtly escalating himself, never overly drawing too much attention to the fact that he is a liar and everything he says is a lie. Everything he talks about and discusses circles back to talking about himself in some way, which would not seem unusual except for the fact that, as Aaron occasionally reminds him, this is not a film for and about him, this is (allegedly) a film for his unborn child.
It's all choreographed, as if it's not his first time opening up to someone else. The levels of discomfort and inappropriateness come in fits and spurts, which he easily tamps down as just his own oddball mannerisms. If you didn't already know this was a horror film, or if this were someone real, you would be easily deceived.
As for the film, some of it lags a bit, especially towards the end, and the actor/writer/director playing Aaron, Patrick Brice, is at best, functional, playing the Straight Man for Duplass to bounce off of.
Ultimately, it's exactly what the title says it is. It's a guy that is a creep. And when the climax of the film comes, the creep Josef has perfected a balance of discomfort all throughout the film to leave just enough reasonable doubt to make you question whether this guy is serious or just in a perpetual joke."

" Creep will make you cringe and then creep you out
",0.0,0.4472,2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,The movie is shot entirely from the view of Aaron's camera meaning we get plently of the handheld camera shots despite that the camera isn't too shakey and is in mostly good positions. A couple of clever editing techniques are used to get the best from film. With such a close film there is plently of time to build up character profiles. Josef's character had me feeling very cringy and unsettled. The horror does pick up later in the piece. A clever movie that builds up the tension mostly through our imaginations and other than some poor character decisions makes the story believable.

Seemingly a low budget, low intensity, low action film, it turns around and smacks you in the face out of no where by dragging you into the scene and making you feel just as anxious as our protagonist. The entire time you're trying to decipher whether or not the ""creep"" is a sociopath or just a weirdo, and honestly it works. Slow burner at the beginning, wraps up by getting your blood pumping and making you cling to the edge of your seat as you experience the fear with Aaron.

Just a bunch of lame jump scares where the main actor (Duplass) hides and then jumps out and screams at the camera. The camera guy keeps making dumb decisions, and you'll be yelling at the screen for him to do the logical thing, but he doesn't. It's too far fetched to be plausible at all, and any normal person would be able to get out of the situation much easier.In the end it I found it more frustrating than frightening, which is a shame because the premise had good potential to be really creepy.If you want a good Duplass movie, watch Safety Not Guaranteed instead."

" An unexpected yet inspiring gem, a better introduction to Mark Duplass as a filmmaker.
",0.6908,0.9823,2020-02-20 00:00:00,9,"I had first seen this movie while sifting through the un-ending cavalcade of low budgeted and uninspired horror films on Netflix. I read the description and saw the rating which was less than favorable. I thought ""Wow, looks like another nothing movie!"". So naturally, with these kinds of films, my mind was drawn to it like an unfortunate soul who suffers from Stockholm's syndrome is drawn to a former abuser until I had finally decided to watch it not too long after.Fully expecting a schlocky, low effort found footage film, I was very pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a weird indirect character study of a man with mental health issues. This film catches most of its audience off guard with either how good it really is, or how uncomfortable it may make you feel at any given moment without justice nor warning. After many viewings of this movie this is the conclusion I have come to:Creep is a subtle and unsettling tale of an unfortunately all to real story that may be more likely to actually happen in society today.This subtlety is very well done only in the way that an experienced filmmaker like Mark Duplass can conjure. From the beginning of the movie, nothing is screaming ""THIS IS EXPOSITION PAY ATTENTION TO THIS"" or ""THIS WILL BE REINCORPORATED LATER INTO THE FILM SO YOU BETTER LOOK AT IT NOW ARENT WE SO SMART?"" The little exposition we do get told at the beginning does not feel forced at all and in fact, it thickens the plot and re-enforces the characters motives.That, as well as wonderfully written lines like ""For a split second, when you saw that axe, did you think i was going to murder you with it?"" that gives off a very awkward yet unsettling tone complimented by the long silence before a response is given, things like this are wonderfully and meaningfully reincorporated later into the movie. This film handles itself nicely and is thankfully coherent all the way through.On top of the presentation of the film, this film also has a great script. When you have two people making a project start to finish like Mark and Patrick have done here, you can really make something amazing. You can smell the passion project aura this film gives off. Most of this is thanks to the script and the acting.The script for this movies features some of the best dialogue coming from Mark Duplass that I've ever seen. The dialogue is so well written that it gives characterization through Marks own words, but the script also gives great indirect characterization through marks actions. This makes for a well developed and likable antagonist. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the protagonist.We dont know much about Patrick Brice's character other than that he's a videographer for hire.We get a bit of a deeper look into Patrick's character when the movie shifts location to his own house and thankfully it gives us a LITTLE more characterization but still not much. I cant really say i was ever rooting for him to escape the clutches of this psychopath because frankly hes just a cardboard man. When the antagonist is a million times more likable than your protagonist in your horror movie then it simply lowers the stakes and makes the climax less engaging.Before i wrap up, the ending to this movie did not shock me or leave me scared but, the scene had my stomach sinking the entire time with its eerie silence and ambiguity. Well played, Mark Duplass.All in all, this film flexes its muscles well. Its all wrapped up in a neat little bow of questionable validity. Thank god we have you, Mark Duplass."

I loved it from the first second to the last.It has some great creepy moments as the name would suggest but it also has some really interesting moments that hold a mirror up to human nature, both the good and the bad, but not in an overly dramatic or profound way. I guess it's understated and subtle yet not enigmatic in any way.I found myself drawn in and amazed but this strange little film, and still thinking about it long after I'd finished it.Creep doesn't exactly fit into a clear cut genre and that's what people both like and dislike about it.

The bare-bones approach of just having 2 actors who mostly chitchat was promising; I figured this movie would be about compelling characters who build suspense without any fancy gimmicks. I was only right about one thing: instead of fancy gimmicks, this film uses lazy, zero-effort gimmicks.The story is simple: an amateur filmmaker is hired to tape a home movie of a weird guy named Josef. Josef claims that he has cancer and wants this movie to be a memento for his son, but it's obvious from the get-go that he's lying & has something to hide. It could've been a fine setup for a psychological tale about an interesting character.But instead, Josef isn't a character. He's just a vehicle for random ""crazy"" antics that feel like something from a youtube skit made by teenagers. He does idiotic things like putting on a wolf mask and growling while rubbing his butt against a door, or telling a lame ""Creative Writing 101"" story about his wife's sexual deviancy, or stealing a lock of the filmmaker's hair while he's asleep. It's the kind of thing that every wacky ""creepy"" character does in a lame comedy, except here it's actually played straight. In the second half of the film especially, he turns into a generic ""creepy gay stalker"" like something out of Family Guy. He also does lots and LOTS of cringe-inducing, meaningless """"""clever"""""" monologues, and they all sound like they were written by sheltered college freshmen who watch too much TV.This film is honestly really pathetic, because it's like someone tried to make a horror movie based on postmodern horror references in pop culture, instead of learning from actual horror films. I can't believe so many reviewers actually call this movie scary and ""deep."" Do all these people live under a rock? If you've viewed any media from the past twenty years, then this movie is just a third-rate imitation of things you've seen before.The other character, the filmmaker, really isn't a character at all. He's a boring nobody who's just there so Josef can screw around with him. That's right: the creators were so lazy, they could only create one gimmicky half-character, so our ""hero"" has exactly zero personality traits.Don't believe any of the hype you hear about this lazy time-waster. If you like cliches and unoriginal things with no subtlety, you'll enjoy this movie. The only good thing I can say about it is that it's mercifully short, at a little over 70 minutes."
" Crap
",-0.3818,-0.9915,2019-11-28 00:00:00,1,"When I planned on watching ""Creep"", I had great expectations for this film. I love found footage horror when it's done right; after all, ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Lake Mungo"" and ""REC"" are three of my favorite horror films. And going into ""Creep"", I expected to be adding it to the list. The premise of a man accidently coming into the house of a psychopath or ""creep"" intrigued me, and found footage would be great for that. But my question now is: what went wrong?Well, for one thing, this movie features what are possibly the dumbest horror movie character. Patrick Brice stars as the main protagonist, Aaron. And while the performance is not terrible, the writing on part of Brice is certainly not good; because even though character makes dumb decision after dumb decision: it doesn't compare to the ending of the film, where after a chaotic night, Aaron decides to give Joseph (the creep) a second chance. And of course, he gets murdered, all because he's an idiot.Another point is that the film is simply not scary, Mark Duplass as the film's antagonist isn't scary. His performance is more along of trying to scary by making faces to the camera. And speaking of that, the movie mostly jump scares, and the attempts at psychological horror only come across as hilariously bad. And even though the film is just 78 minutes, it's never riveting. I'm either boggled at the stupidity of the character, annoyed at the constant jump scares, or yelling at the screen.So why this has an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes? Honestly, I'm not sure. Credit where credit's due, the film is shot well enough. The acting is not necessarily terrible. And the directing from Patrick Brice is probably competent part of this film. But as much as I love visuals and directing, the writing is far too much of a travesty to forgive.If you like ""Creep"", I don't care. But to me, this film is just plain old crap."

The actor who portrays Josef is delightfully creepy in such a subtle and excelled way. You can kind of tell that the entire movie is improv, just because it's SO genuine with the reactions and wtf moments.I don't know, I had a lot of fun watching it, and I was pleasantly surprised.

I like found footage style and it's not too bad in this film the script even sounds great although it's just poorly executed.
Ridiculous jump scares and thrown in as jokes and the characters are just wrong,just being weird for the sake of weird.
It's tries to build up to a some big ending while keeping the viewers in the dark and again it's just falls short..

" A letdown
",0.0,0.8818,2019-10-09 00:00:00,4,"Creep starts promising, but ends up being another half baked found footage movie but with good intentions.
Mark Duplass is a blast to watch, playing so perfectly the charismatic psycho, making you keep till the end. The weirdness of his character helped to create some tense moments throught the film, especially those with Peachfuzz.
But, as almost any other films of the genre, Creep falls in the obvious clichés: stupid jumpscares (they seriously don't make any sense), the character keeps filming when he shouldn't, etc. And my complaints don't end there. Unlike Mark Duplass, Patrick Brice (also the director) just can't act, his character is extremely unbelievable because he makes the most odd decisions.
But still, Creep manages to be not a total waste because of Mark Duplass and some great tension scenes. Also the movie is very short, so you may want to give it a try, but you most likely be letdown."

He acts in such a way that reveals his intentions to the viewer in bold text. This could have been used perfectly to involve an incredible plot-twist. Instead, our beliefs at the beginning come true after the hour long wait.Aaron is brain-dead. Firstly, I would've dipped from the get-go: It's clear Josef is full of rubbish and he continuously asks creepy questions. The police phone call is very unrealistic as the evidence is very plausible. In this horror film the survival logic is nonsense.The axe to the head was brutally awesome but I could only concentrate on the fact that Aaron was dumb enough to not look around. Numerous parts of the film don't make sense to me. Somehow Josef gets film of his killing every time without being caught. His strategy for murdering the cameramen is awful. He had so many opportunities to kill Aaron and he keeps him on edge instead of tricking him into a false sense of safety. Maybe that's just because he is a psychopath but it's still annoying either way.This film relied on silly jump scares which were only scary a third of the time. Not a well thought horror in any way at all."

I also admire that most of the dialogue was improvised--this gave the situation the exact awkwardness that could make viewers uncomfortable.

Perhaps it was a free plot structure or the limited number of characters but there is a rawness rarely seen in found footage but at the same time has such personality in both its main characters.Josef is such a vivid character that would get anyone on edge. Watching the first time I regretted that they didn't keep their cards closer to their chest with Josef's disquieting nature but now I see him as someone who always has something chilling to say.This got under my skin in way that is hard to do.

I nonchalantly decided I would throw on Creep thinking that it would be a campy Horror-Comedy ala Shaun, but instead what I got were the most aggressively uncomfortable minutes watching a film ever.The start of the film had me a bit bored and annoyed; rolling my eyes at the introduction we get with the 2 characters of the movie. At about 15 minutes in that annoyance transpired into confusion, 20 minutes I'm sentimental (wtf) and then 30 I'm paranoid, 40 minutes I'm literally sweating. The great thing about this film is that there is no exposition, the cameraman is a nice everyday guy that anybody could be or maybe was; slightly naive 20-something who is nice, financially challenged and needs cash, so the plot set up makes sense. What he says and how reacts to certain things that our ""creep"" does make sense. The dread builds cement being poored: thick and muddy and gets heavier as it falls. Oh my lord, they managed to make a post-modern art deco house look like a jungle gym for psychopaths. The little gestures and mindgames that Josef does to Aaron are super bonechilling; it's to the point where he gets himself into Aaron's head and has dreams about him. Trust me when I say this is heavy stuff; I LOVE horror movies and this really violated my sense of safety for a few days. Only gripes are that some of the scenes felt a bit odd to stay engaged and the ending could have been done without the tropes.Recommended. Don't watch it alone!"

Creep is a good movie for horror fans: it mocks the jumpscare aspect of common horror movies while it still manages to get you either way; it goes beyong the usual found footage, not killing its protagonista right after the violent cut on the video; it presents to us a serialç killer thats fairly interesting (and, as any good killer should, owns an alluring character and maintains a continuous sexual tension throughout the whole movie).

When the Creep begins to start taking baths with the guy and scaring the camera man in adnormal ways you really start to get a sense of what is going on. It's definetly worth a watch if you are into weird movies that will keep you feeling surprised and different.

The movie is filled with uncomfortable and awkward moments that will creep you out in a psychological way, and I guarantee you'll groan at the main character's stupidity on more than one occasion. If you like horror/thriller movies and you can't decide what to watch, I'd recommend giving it a shot."

Thoroughly uncomfortable and cringe worthy, but we all know that was the intent. What I sort of loved was the simplicity of the cinematography. This all could have easily been shot on an iPhone. Yes, that makes it seem real, but the artistic possibilities of zero budget filmmaking exhibited here seem endless.

Creep 2 is also great and I can't wait for the third installment. I would highly recommend this movie if you appreciate a general idea for a psychological mind melt perfected by it's creators.

Of coarse there were sometimes I thought Aaron made bad decisions and should have left while he could. But as stated in the film, Aaron was one special snowflake who always saw the best in people and who clearly needed the money (maybe a friend as well?). Creep is one of those horror movies you can't keep off your mind. And the ending is honestly one of the rawest, most genius endings I've ever seen. I love how the movie takes it's time and nothing is rushed as they usually do in horror movies, the footage view and the incredibly creepy creep."

" I'm not a fan of Found Footage, and the story here is far for impressive, but Mark Duplass's charcter and acting make this a truely terrifying film.
",-0.6576,0.8993,2018-07-05 00:00:00,7,"Let me start off by saying I am not at all a fan of the Found Footage sub-genre, or any other cinematographic project which is shot in first person view. The only reason I've decided to give Creep a try was that I ran out of Netflix English-speaking Horror and I like foreign films even less (nothing racist, heavens forbid, I simply find them more difficult to follow due to the sheer dependency on subtitles). That being said, I'm quite glad I did try out Creep, as it has some very memorable moments and features.First of all, the cast, by which I of course mean Mark Duplass as the creepy and unnerving Joseph. Some actors simply have certain physical and exterior features that when used right make them perfect for certain typecasts. Duplass is absolutely unforgettable as the neurotic and disturbed creep-type, always keeping you on the borderline between pity and sheer terror.The story itself is nice, though too full of holes for my liking (the ending in particular, which was completely unconvincing and forced, you'll know what I mean when you reach it). However, unlike most Found Footage films, Creep uses very little ""camera effects"" and does so delicately enough to not steal focus from the actual film. Add to that Duplass's amazing acting and on-the-spot role and you get a film that is scary enough to be enjoyed even by those who, like myself, prefer to avoid this sub-genre.All in all, I'd say this film is a must-watch for fans of the sub-genre and possibly rewarding enough for other Horror fans. My relatively high rating is absolutely due to Duplass, I can't stress enough how perfect he was for this part and how amazingly fitting his acting was."

",-0.5719,-0.9818,2018-06-21 00:00:00,5,"Videographer Aaron (Patrick Brice) takes a job to film oddball Josef (Mark Duplass) living in a remote mountain cabin. Josef claims to be a cancer survivor and that this is a video for his unborn son. At first, Josef is simply an energetic oddball with fascinating stories. His awkwardness turns darker and darker. As Josef sleeps, Aaron takes a call coming into the house. It's Josef's sister. She warns Aaron to leave immediately.This is a two hander and let's face it, Aaron is a dud. He's mostly behind the camera but he isn't much even when he's on screen. Mark Duplass is pretty creepy but the intensity isn't there. That leaves the movie with little tension. Patrick Brice is directing and it may work better if Aaron is played by a woman. This is an indie horror with limited scares. It's a bad way to use found footage for a horror movie. By extending the timeline, this becomes a low intensity stalker movie rather than a scary horror. Even the big climatic scene has its own problem. Josef's shadow goes over Aaron who must be able to see him coming."

" A tubby full of peach fuzz
",0.0,0.9801,2018-06-08 00:00:00,5,"An NPR podcast ran a story a while back, in which the NPR-ish narrator recalls with some embarrassment how he didn't realize that a kooky guy he had been friends with for years was in fact a homeless pathological liar. At first, the listener naturally assumes the story would be about the mechanics of this prodigious feat of deceit. But then it slowly becomes evident that the real story is how much of a gormless doofus the narrator happens to be, and how he had essentially enabled this charade the entire time by ignoring all sorts of obvious warning signs.The dynamic is kinda the same here. It's also my main gripe with this film, but later on that. In the tradition of modern American workplace criticism etiquette, the turd sandwich must always start with a compliment:Mark Duplass - aka the actor who plays the titular creep - totally carries the entire film. As far as character acting is concerned, he nails this role. It's hard to be menacing and endearing at the same time, and Duplass pulls it off with a weird grace that keeps the viewer off-balance for most of the film, even when he is not present on screen. Even though you know the general direction the film is veering in, this kooky fella's weird ramblings and edgy antics will keep you guessing throughout!The other character - played by Partick Brice - is a pasty, out-of-shape, out-of-work camera-beardo. He is not particularly dumb - in fact, he seems to be guardedly on edge from the get-go - but he is bland, unimaginative, and for lack of a better term, just plain ineffective. He is unemployed and alone; he wears a ""fitness to productivity office workouts"" t-shirt to bed. (Brice totally nails this role.)Now, when you pair a malleable doofus like that with a vibrant weirdo, all sorts of interesting possibilities open up. Perhaps they would have been explored if these guys had more money. If this cost more than several grand to make, I don't see how or why: the only other person in the film besides the two leads is a voice on the other end of a 30 second phone call, no effects and minimal props, and the whole film could have probably been filmed and edited on an iPad. With this in mind, the film is actually a dazzling example of squeezing the most out of a shoestring budget. But what at first feels like a realized vision veers into the territory of a squandered opportunity as it nears its disappointingly anticlimactic conclusion, racking up an ever-growing list of plausibility gripes along the way. The cameraman has bizarre recurring dreams, but they're pointless - they don't inform his actions, they don't indicate character development...they hardly even qualify as generic foreshadowing! And even though there's nothing inherently implausible about wanting to keep the law out of certain situations, the writing in that regard has to be one of the lazier efforts in horror at addressing the absence of cops. So it's pretty dumb, and even though it's technically a horror film, most of the ""jump scares"" in the film are literally the creepy guy running away from the camera guy and then jumping out at him from the corner like a 9 year old. Boo indeed. But the two leads make this more entertaining than it ought to be, and though it's not particularly scary, it has a wry, improvised sense of humor that had the potential to really knock this one out of the park - if only their ideas about character trajectory were better developed."

",0.6369,-0.7091,2018-05-09 00:00:00,10,"I ranked this a 10. I believe it is the best of its genre. Not since the original Blair Witch, has a found footage film come close to this home run. I clicked play on this little gem, having zero clue what I was about to watch, and loved every creepy second. If you lack the ability to suspend disbelief, this is not for you. If you can endure the feeling of just being skeeved out, while simultaneously enjoying the nonstop uncomfortable feeling of not knowing whether to laugh or be scared, then this is for you. You might find yourself repetitively asking yourself, ""WTF am I watching?"" This is a genre cult classic. This might be the Evil Dead 2 equivalent of found footage psychological thrillers."

The ""scary moments"" simply didn't work, and the acting by both the cast was just awful. The only thing that can save a movie with a bad story and bad acting is entertainment value.

Meaning it will not take very long to get to the laughably stupid ending (I will not reveal this because I am not a spoiler) First off, it becomes very obvious from the get go that this guy is not what he claims to be (a dying father trying to reconnect with his children) If it is not obvious to you then I am forced to ask: How many films have you actually seen? Can't be too many. I am not sure why I continued to watch it after a certain point(you will know when that is when it happens) but I guess morbid curiosity and time spent up to that point stand for something(although I stopped watching ""Shutter Island"" about 40 minutes in, glad that I had not paid to see it.) but then when the end came I just shook my head in disbelief. Their were a few ways they could have gone with this but chose the stupidest one they could come up with. If you value your time at all, please don't make the mistake I made and use 85 minutes watching this nonsense.(I would have given it no stars but you have to give at least one so I figured it's that fact that it isn't very long.)"

The guy is a creep from the start, but you just never know what he is going to do next or when. He doesnt seem to have a reason for murdering except just wanting to make a show. It ends with a basic murder, but the way he builds it up is so amusing. Instead of just terrorizing his victim he made it a game or experiment and it made for the most interesting movie I've ever seen."
" This is a hit or miss for the viewer
",-0.1531,0.9218,2018-03-25 00:00:00,5,"My quick rating - 4,7/10. I don't know. A movie that has the ""good"" and the ""bad"" reaching so far extremes makes rating ti difficult. First off, handicam movies are not a novelty anymore, and I am sick of MOST of them. Yes there are some good ones, ""Chronicle"" reached the plateau, but most of them think it is still something new. Bad news it is not. At least the story of this movie warranted it being used, though which is a lot more than I can say for ""Phoenix Forgotten"" Ok, I should stick with this movie. The acting is above average for sure. Mark Duplass does a great job of making the dialogue and facial expressions creepy, yet so believable. His character is almost unnerving in how it seems like the everyday guy you see at the grocery store. Also Patrick Brice as the one who answers the ad for a single day job of videotaping this guy for a $1000 bucks does a really good job with adapting to the strangeness of what is going on. Oh, and since those two also wrote this, I am sure it kind of flowed for them as to what they were thinking as they wrote the story. Get used to those two, they are the only characters in the movie (minus a female voice on the phone). Yet they carried out the story well. The bad news is, there wasn't much to the story and if you read other reviews, don't expect some smack in the face ending. I'd say check it out for the acting but don't expect much beyond that."

" Creepy uncomfortable and Original - Not a horror movie
",0.4015,0.9863,2018-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Ok so this movie in my opinion is a really good movie. (note i didn't say ""scary movie"") Now the reason i'm reviewing is because there were a lot of really good reviews and a lot of really negative reviews. So i'm here to hopefully show you both sides without giving any spoilers. I'll start with the bad:
If you don't like handheld camera movies then you wont like this movie because that is how the whole movie is filmed. If you don't like feeling uncomfortable or awkward then you wont like this movie. But honestly i don't like those things either but i loved this movie.If you are looking for a movie with twists at the end then this isn't your movie. If you are looking for a movie with demons, paranormal activity, ghosts, monsters, werewolves, vampires etc... then this is not your movie. This is just about a creepy guy. It is a straight forward movie that is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable. So the bad reviews I can tell are very very picky people when it comes to scary movies but as i said before don't go into this thinking of it as a scary movie. Think of it as a movie where if you were in that position you would be creeped out. Hence the title of the movie and first person point of view. I read a few reviews that complain that the first scene is too much of a close up on the guys face as he talks to the camera but i think what they are forgetting is that this is a movie about a guy using a handheld camera and i think the director wanted it to look more amateur than professional...obviously. So remember - this is meant to look amateurSome other reviews were upset that the main character had many opportunities to leave when it was getting too creepy but didn't. I actually laughed out loud at that only because isn't every person in horror movies usually an idiot? I mean what character has common sense in scary movies??? Ok so the good:
We normally watch scary movies because of suspense, jumpy scenes, twists, monsters and the thrill right? Well since this isn't a scary movie you get something a little different. I would say the reason i liked this movie is because it made me uncomfortable. I kept putting myself in the main characters shoes on what i would do or how i would handle these weird creepy things that goes on and it made it fun to watch at the same time of being so weirded out.When I say creepy by the way, i don't mean a cemetery at midnight or spiders. I mean creepy in Human form. We all know people can just be plain creepy. So picture a person you've crossed paths with before that has creeped you the eff out. Whether it was a stranger or someone you just got a really weird vibe from. Well that is this movie except the main character hangs out just a little bit longer than any of us normal people would and well i guess you'll see how much creepier they can get. I think this movie is super original. I was like all the people writing the negative reviews. I turned it on because i wanted to watch a jumpy horror movie. even though this wasn't the scariest movie ever - there still are jumpy parts, there is still the element of not knowing what is going to happen next, there definitely is a creep factor and the uncomfortable feeling you get while watching it. If you do decide to watch it - remember to watch it knowing it is meant to be amateur style filmed, not a horror movie, no twists, but is creepy, uncomfortable and original and i really think you will enjoy it!"

" A small classic
",0.0,0.25,2018-03-12 00:00:00,8,"""Creep"" is a classic, one of the best horror movies of the new millennium. Mark Duplass is superb in his role of Josef, perhaps the titular ""creep"". The found footage thing gets a bad rap, but it has been done to superb effect before: consider ""Man Bites Dog"", ""Blair Witch Project"", ""Paranormal Activity"", and the short film ""Safe Haven"". ""Creep"" is another classic to add to this list.The film really only involves two actors, and I was surprised, in a sense, to hear that it is mostly improvised. Before watching ""Creep"", I would have had a hard time imagining improvisation working in a horror movie. It seems like you could all too easily stray from the fearsome undercurrent each scene is supposed to carry with it - or, you could try to make everything you say scary, and thus merely become ridiculous.It must have been a tightrope, but Duplass and Brice were more than up to the challenge.""Creep"" has possibly the most naturalistic acting seen in a found footage film since ""Blair Witch""."
" Quite routine
",0.0,-0.9445,2018-02-27 00:00:00,5,"CREEP is another found footage horror flick from the team at Blumhouse Productions. I found it suffered somewhat for having no script; as believable as they are as actors, the guys on screen can't be expected to do all the work themselves and as such the dialogue often feels repetitive and low key. The story is a simple two-hander about a video blogger who answers a Craigslist advert to spend time with a man dying of cancer. It soon becomes a psychological battle of wills between the two characters. Nothing much happens here, other than a few very mildly creepy moments, and the only time it really hits home is at the powerful twist climax. Otherwise I found it quite routine."
" Creep - a game changer in found footage
",0.0,-0.9605,2018-01-27 00:00:00,10,"Creep distinguishes itself from the usual found footage horror movie in some certain points. What makes it interesting is the fact that the killer isn't some vague, uncanny character but is right in front of you through the whole movie. That being said you got to acknowledge that you never really get to know Josef. Who is the guy really? Which of the things he tells Aaron are fiction and which are fact? The sublime portrayal by Mark Duplass of this complex and mysterious figure makes you hungry to learn the truth about this character. And you feel sorry for Aaron who tries to puncture this bubble.A significant turning moment in the movie is the phone call Aaron makes with Josefs sister. This is the only moment in the whole movie you are really sure you get to hear facts about the antagonist. After this moment the atmosphere changes drastically in a more dark one.The movie portrays the complexity of the interactions between two people who are are completely handed down to each other. Creep brings up emotions of anxiety and claustrophobia to his audience. You get a sharper look inside how it's got to be coping with a stalker who is completely obsessed with you and you can't get rid of. The uncomfortable feeling of never being safe goes on even when Aaron frreed himself from Jones house. The movie brings a new breath in the horror genre and is a must see for everyone who is sick of the clichés this genre usually contains."

I am generally on spot with metascore , why i picked this movie to watch and expected to be pleasantly surprised but i was very underwhelmed and found it really hard to finish it. I almost feel like the standard of creative thinking and horror has fallen dramatically, i promise u after u have watched this movie you'll be thinking that anyone could write this , there is nothing exciting in it. In all honesty I promise you, you can write a better script on this setting , it was that dull.

Mark Duplass was brilliant as Joseph in this film,he could totally be a new horror icon,he actually reminded me so much of Kathy Bates performance as Annie Wilkes in Misery,based on Stephen King's novel which I later actually found out was inspired by it. Creep is a brilliant twisty found footage horror film with a bit of comedy and a bit of horror as well. Stay tuned,obviously after watching this,for Creep 2!"
" Tong in cheek brilliance
",0.5994,0.5812,2017-10-21 00:00:00,8,"In the first few minutes of this movie, we were confused by the weird acting and amateurish setting. It's about an eccentric man who hires another man to videotape his story. From the first second the story is unhinged, which gives an eerie feeling to the interviewer, but also to the audience. How crazy is the lead actor? Or how dangerous? Where will it go? Or is he just weird?While watching the feeling grew onto us that this amateurish feeling was intentional. The movie grew into a psychological thriller that turned out to be improvised. Everything was minimalistic, based on a simple setting, few props and mostly conversations and facial expressions. The movie is viewed through the eyes of the interviewer who is also the cameraman (hand cam). His feelings are your feelings and it will take a while for the watcher to realize that what starts as weird, turned into terrifying and claustrophobic.The amateurish setting and acting are a blend of improvisation, perfect timing (which is the main ingredient of horror and comedy) and great hidden skill. The strength doesn't lie in anticipation and gore, but in everything else. Happy to know that a sequel is coming."
" Simple AND really good
",0.4927,0.9233,2017-10-02 00:00:00,9,"Found footage movies seem like a dime a dozen and often are not done well or respect. But this one, this one is a diamond in the rough.Both actors play their roles extremely well. The tone is effective because you can bad feel things coming, yet they still manage to throw in good comedic relief at the same time. Independent filmmakers need to watch and take notes, because this film seemed to have very limited resources and yet it's very well made and profitable.It's on Netflix now so give it a watch (it's only 80 minutes long). And I look forward to the sequel."
" I loved this movie. Definitely something new
",0.765,0.9567,2017-09-26 00:00:00,10,"I rated this movie with a 10, because it is very rare to see something new on the streets regarding movies.The acting is top notch and the tongue-in-cheek acting / writing is a lot of fun.The actual 'Creep' is done very well. Often we're misled into believing one thing and then it twists.The movie fascinated me and I had a very good time. I wish there were more movies like this :)"
" Not bad but not good
",-0.2924,0.7935,2017-08-18 00:00:00,4,"I would have rated this higher for the acting, but this story was too predictable.It started out pretty good and then fell flat about 20 minutes in. I pretty much knew Josef was a psychopath from the very beginning, especially with the tubby time, and the stalking of Aaron was no surprise. Aaron's blase reaction to the stalking is just apathetic. Then he goes and meets him in a deserted place, WTH? The pace of this movie was snail like, and I had the urge to fast forward a few times."
" Clever but with stupid decisions
",-0.5574,-0.1296,2017-08-11 00:00:00,4,"The story does a good job to realistically have the victim be creeped out by the killer from his odd story early on but why would you cave in to being invited back in to the house for a drink before you go on your way? I understand the situation with his keys but still. You know he's up to no good and that it probably won't go very well if you accept. At the part of that invite, I thought, ""Don't do it. But I know you're going to because this is a movie and specifically a horror."" Then, who leaves their front door unlocked? (It's a horror movie :) )"
" Easy to see why it is certified fresh!
",0.6696,0.5569,2017-07-24 00:00:00,9,"This movie is highly enjoyable, as you are unsuspecting of the true intentions of both parties at the start. By the resolve, Mark Duplass has turned into what is identified as a ""creep"" and poor Aaron (Patrick Brice) is a maybe-too-trusting cameraman.This movie begins slow but very quickly picks up speed.This movie will redefine the found footage genre as something hyper-realistic and terrifyingly so."
" No logic, none.
",-0.296,-0.8972,2017-07-20 00:00:00,2,"This film does not deserve a rating of 6.2 which is what attracted me to it in the first place. From the beginning the cameraman is given strong hints that the Creep is false, unstable, untrustworthy or dangerous. The cameraman does not seem to possess any logic or survival instinct either. An example would be when he exits the bathroom to find that the drugged Joseph has left the place he was sleeping, he exits the building into the pitch black, unarmed, in an area that (he believes) Joseph knows particularly well. Logic would have him stay inside, armed, until it is light when he can make his escape with full visibility. He continues to use the camera to look around (I am aware it is a hand-held camera film but most of these have had some ounce of logic i.e. Blair Witch use of camera for light source) rather than defend himself. I won't elaborate on all the examples of failed logic but that is a sample. Overall would not recommend. There are greater horrors out there."
" A dark psychological horror
",-0.5719,0.4404,2017-06-15 00:00:00,9,"This as titled is probably the creepiest movie I've ever seen. Mostly due to it's realism and plausibility. It isn't one of those jump scare horror movies that get so old. It's one of those original movies that make you sickly curious of what's going to happen next. At times, I felt bad for the antagonist and that's how the film gets you. You can tell that Aaron has empathy to Josef but at the same time you are screaming in your head to run. Such a great ending left me squirming. Exactly what I want out of this genre. Will watch again just to appreciate the Easter eggs."
" Creepy
",0.0,0.6623,2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"This is a great Horror film. It is not your cliché good looking teenagers in the woods picked off one by one by a crazy redneck. Instead it is just really weird and unsettling so when the scares come they are ultimately more effective. The premise is strong and it is put together in a very creative way. There are even a few dark jokes which was nice. I'm running out of things to say. If you like Horror, give this a try."
" Creepy, but dumb.
",-0.6652,-0.9892,2017-05-29 00:00:00,3,"Found this in HMV a couple of weeks back & got round to watching it last week on Thursday. Well after I watching I'd say the film wasn't all that great. I mean, there was some creepy things going on, I myself was tensing up every time the camera turned a corner or suddenly turned around & the guy Josef himself was a deranged creep with very & I mean very eccentric ways, but the premise just seemed a bit weak. There was not a bit of gore in the film, especially at the end, which I think was justifiable to have some gore in it. I also couldn't help but find the victims decisions to be completely dumb & dangerous! I mean, someone's after you why not disappear? Not to mention the part at the end, *Spoiler Alert* when he got out the car after agreeing to meet with him at the park, with his back turned, to the guy with the creepy wolf mask, who, like a ninja, crept up behind him & axed him to death right on the top of the head! Surely he would've heard the guy behind him, right? Pfft. No, of course not...Not to mention the unrealistically of the police not being helpful! The guy giving Josef the address to his house & of course him remaining in that said house & making the dumb decision to meet the creepy git! Damn!Like I said, the jump scares were good & the tension was there. But the villain getting away with it, was just a dumb cliché! It was alright to watch & better than than 1999's Blair Witch film, but this one could've been better.3/10"
" Just Not My Favorite Style of Film Making
",-0.357,0.8017,2017-05-21 00:00:00,5,"After Blair Witch, which I did enjoy, with very few exceptions have I come across another ""found footage"" film, that I've liked since. In fact, many of them bore me to tears, and/or make me laugh.I suppose if this type of film style is your forte, I would think this movie, mostly about stalking, would be one that you would enjoy. Objectively, it has some very realistic acting, and I some ""creepy"" scenes. If you are like me, and tend to find these types of films, quite boring and silly, this one is no different. I can see how it showcases a very realistic and feasible situation which adds to the creepiness and tension of the movie.It isn't a terribly made movie, its just a matter of viewing preferences.The last scene made me laugh."
" Cheap Amateurish film will Really Annoy the heck out of Most Normal Viewers
",-0.4927,0.9869,2017-04-10 00:00:00,2,"Nothing about the plot - other reviewers have provided that information. This film is done on a budget of probably around $20,000. The producers have been very careful to conceal this fact. There are literally only TWO screen actors and one additional voice actor. All footage is shaky HAND HELD CAMERA. Probably 2 or 3 days of filming and an additional day of editing to put this together and sync in the audio. The number of reviews here on IMDb and more importantly the ratings themselves are obviously the result of bot technology that allows the owners of the film to reproduce a normal distribution centering on a nominal rating of 7/10. This is total deception. A normal movie going viewer looking for entertainment, scares, thrills or perhaps something interesting or moving would watch this film and think someone was playing a prank on them. Most regular people would rate this in the range of 2/10, 3/10 or 4/10. It is as if the individuals who produced the film said to each other "" Hey lets see if we can make a film in a couple days and use modern internet technology to create the appearance that its popular - and lets see if we can fool a bunch of people into watching it - ha ha ... "". If you watch this film you will probably come to the same conclusion. I'm not joking.Normal components of story content, acting, coherency and consistency of character behavior are so deficient that you will constantly have a feeling of discomfort regardless of whether you think the plot has any merit whatsoever. This is truly a poorly constructed piece of cheap film making.The highest quality part of the film was the DVD/BluRay cover - the promo shot showing a shadowed individual at the top of some poorly lit stairs with the word "" CREEP "" written across the top. The composition / colorization / lighting spectrum do look professional. The film looks nothing like this at all.I'm taking the 10 minutes to write this review with the hope that I will save others from being fooled into tracking down a copy of the DVD and grinding their way through the 72 minutes of this piece of crap.There are so many great films out there which are truly entertaining. Spend a few more minutes and find one of those."

The very last minute of ""footage"", it has a cheesy, boring and annoying jump scare. I seriously cannot believe someone took this garbage seriously. Its a perfect example of everything bad with horror movies today.What a let down...."
" More of a spaghetti story than a horror film
",-0.5719,-0.9798,2017-03-10 00:00:00,3,"If you're all about getting bored and watching some DeviantArt-esque ""tubby time"" involving a murderous furry, then this is the film for you!Build-up tried requires payoff. But this movie? It broke new ground by instead having complete bathos. Was it ineffective and unsatisfying? Yes! Perhaps there's a reason all other films don't go for this kind of lackluster narrative...Get ready for YouTube vlog tier editing in one of the only found footage films dumb enough to only have one camera in operation, inevitably making all editing hideous and every cut demolish your immersion. Seriously, big mistake.The ending jumpscare might be the worst one of its kind ever filmed. I fear for the legions of people who were forced to watch this abomination by their friends, and the relationships it inevitably destroyed."
" Creep
",0.0,-0.9657,2017-03-06 00:00:00,4,"Not to be confused with the 2004 British slasher set in Charing Cross Underground Station, 'Creep' is an American Hand-held horror movie about a film-maker who answers an advert to film a dying man to leave something for his unborn child.The screenplay and performances are not very good but the film's over reliance on annoying jump scares make some scenes fill with tension. The film tries to bring up connections with 'The Blair Witch Project' but fails to be anywhere near as good due to the fact that it is poorly executed and has unsympathetic characters.It has a silly ending to top it all off but it leaves quite a resonating impact."
" Meandering and pointless
",0.0,-0.9022,2017-02-12 00:00:00,1,"I watched this because of it's high ratings, it wasn't worth it in the least.For a movie that's supposed to be a horror/thriller there's no real tension, they try to build some up but the improvisational nature of the movie just derails it as none of the conversations are interesting and they rely on fake out jump scares to try and fill in for this.There's nothing new or clever in this, it doesn't execute the genre norms well and it does nothing to bring anything new to them either(there was one moment where I thought it might go somewhere interesting in that there was a chance to throw a curve-ball in who the creep was but no, it just charges head-long into predictability), the characters are uninteresting and I had no attachment to out wary and bored feeling protagonist.The initial premise is clichéd, the build up is dull and the pay-off is zero, don't bother at all."
" An example of what found footage horror should be.
",-0.5719,0.9519,2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Creep is a subtle yet uncomfortable experience of a horror film, in the best way. Unlike other found footage there's little reliance on jump scares and gore and more of a building tension created through the conversation and actions of Mark Duplass' character. Some of his actions can seem harmless and yet hides an underlying creepiness which becomes more visible as the movie goes on. I was pleasantly surprised by the structure of this film and it will definitely keep your interest as long as you give it a chance. Best way to describe the feeling this movie emitted to me is a beginning of second hand embarrassment and uncomfortableness to pure creepiness and an unsettling atmosphere. Whether you're a fan of found footage or not, I believe you will love this, just don't expect many jump scares or much blood and gore."
