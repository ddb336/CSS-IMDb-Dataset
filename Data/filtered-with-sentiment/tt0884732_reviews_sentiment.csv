" Kevin Hart killed it!
",-0.6996,0.8622,2021-04-08 00:00:00,10,Hilarious! Laughed through the whole movie. Funniest Kevin Hart film ever.
" Entertaining
",0.4404,0.9688,2021-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Funny movie, it doesn't have a very complex story which makes it quite easy to watch. It's surprisingly entertaining and it was made for laugh (which completely suceeds).
Good cast selection!!!!! :)"
" Unnecessary hate on this movie
",-0.5719,0.9631,2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Let's be honest this is movie was not made to win any oscars. Having said that this is a great movie to watch after a tough day or week.. Just some mindless fun.
On screen chemistry is great. They didn't waste too much time on backstories, just enough to get you rooting for the characters.
Kevin Hart and Josh Gad are great as an on screen duo.
All in all a great watch."
" The fat actor is cringe
",0.0,0.2323,2021-02-15 00:00:00,4,"Movie ain't that bad, but the nachos scene was cringe to see and so the fat actor."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9041,2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,This is hands down one of the best movies I've watched! The comedy. The actors. The script. Its all amazingg. I love it.
" Kevin Heart at his best
",0.6369,0.9202,2021-02-07 00:00:00,8,"The movie was great, it had good jokes, some of them didn't really land. Overall, really great movie. Now, for the spoiler part of my review, I felt that Doug Harris' fianc√©e wasn't that mean at the begging of the movie, towards the end she became really awful. At the end of the movie, Doug and Jimmy go on a guy trip and if you remember ""Lost"", you're in for a fun little reference."
" Good potential and some heart, but goes off the rails
",0.2382,-0.7696,2021-01-23 00:00:00,5,"This movie really had a lot of potential. Kevin Hart is at the top of his game and seems laser focused in every scene. He really did a terrific job carrying this movie. Josh Gad did also did a very good job, and the premise was actually quite interesting.About halfway through, it seems the writers got bored and sat in a room asking each other ""what is the most absurd, distasteful, stupid, cringy thing you can come up with?"" Then they took two or three of those ideas and ran with them. Ran off a cliff.What is otherwise a fairly charming and funny movie about loneliness, bromances and love (or fake love), the movie becomes ruined with a few too many zany scenes of complete insanity.It seems cringe is all the rage these days. It's a trend in many movies. And I'm not really a fan of it, unless it's executed extremely well.This movie is ruined by the overwhelming desire to become more and more edgy and chaotic, to its detriment. There are moments that really shine, but they are overwhelmed by cliched fat-guy-gets-hit-in-the-balls scenes over and over and over again.I wanted to like it, but I found myself shaking my head while burying it in my hands too many times. It's too bad. The Hart/Gad chemistry is there (and it's quite good), and with a little more heart and a little less cringe, this could have had a bit of a Will Smith and Kevin James ""Hitch"" thing going on. Alas, it falls far short of what it could've been."
" Surprised I finished this
",0.2263,0.9887,2020-09-10 00:00:00,2,"I settled in thinking I was going to enjoy a decent knockoff of Wedding Crashers.I was wrong.Spoilers below.Interesting idea, very formulaic execution, some comedic elements took away from the film, and some of the teleplay was negatively over the top.It would have been interesting to see if Vince Vaughn and Owen Williams could have pulled this movie together.The kind of enjoyed the first half of the film and the dancing segment was very enjoyable. The second half was not and I openly asked myself why I was watching this film.Kevin Hart's love interest story was not realistic in any sense, even remotely. Josh Glad's new lust interest b/c of her oral skills just sets him for another failure and plays well off the romantic comedy script of finding love. The groomsmen failure was not very entertaining. A little success and then epic crash and burns would have been funny. Josh's tag line was pretty bad. They tried fleshing the groomsmen out and devoted time to do it but it never gelled and the unifying event never brought them together as a crew and convinced Josh or Kevin that they could work together to get the job done in my opinion. there was never a . Too many relationships to try and build in 90+ mins. It was unimaginatively formulaic and it's later comedic elements FormulaicI cannot even say the movie is a good B movie, I honestly think it is a class ""C"" movie, and not a good one at that."
" Sensitive romcom
",0.0,0.9753,2020-07-28 00:00:00,7,"It's a romcom, so don't expect a plot that will Winn the Pullzer price. But it's entertaining, well acted and has some laughs in it. A happy end. So all basic elements of a feel good romcom. And it even has some serious layer about men friendship over it."
" Meh
",-0.0772,-0.8955,2020-07-20 00:00:00,4,"Though it had a couple of moments and for the old football stars, this is not that great. Kaley has no range, Josh Gad is terrible, Mimi, Cloris and Olivia are underused and wasted. Kevin Hart is so restrained by the weak script and writing, it's like watching someone pretending to be Hart."
" Absolutely hilarious!
",0.5081,0.3859,2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,I haven't laughed this much in a minute. This film had a great message about friendship and was hilarious as hell.
" Awesome Comedy
",0.765,0.8957,2020-02-26 00:00:00,9,What a great movie the Kevin hart And Josh gad combo workerd perfect well worth a watch will have you in stitches the whole way..
" Good laugh
",0.7579,0.8066,2019-12-24 00:00:00,8,"Did we laugh watching it? Absolutely! That what counts for me when I watch a comedy. You will predict what's gonna happen in the end since it's the same cliche, still, it's very funny. Plus, that Lost reference at the end tho."
" Gadd earns The Wedding Ringer one of its stars and the other is awarded to the editor who only saw fit to put cinemagoers through 100 minutes of it
",0.6369,0.9239,2019-08-07 00:00:00,2,"When the kind, yet socially awkward Doug (Josh Gadd) gets the beautiful, if a little vacant, Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, of The Big Bang Theory) to marry him, he doesn't have the heart to tell her that not only does he not have a best man, he hasn't got any close friends to be part of the wedding party at all.Cue Jimmy (Kevin Hart) who offers an underground service posing as a life-long friend and acting best man for geeky, lonely men all over the country.The necessary catch to spice up the storyline is that Doug requires a service Jimmy has never offered before - he needs a full party of groomsmen to learn everything about him and keep up the charade against Gretchen's questioning for an entire weekend.Yes, this premise is familiar to you - it's Wedding Crashers bromance humour meets The Wedding Singer's attempt at real emotions.Gadd's an unusual choice for a leading man and his genuine nice-guy persona (how could you not like the man behind the scene-stealing snowman in Disney's Frozen) earns The Wedding Ringer one of its stars and the other is awarded to the editor who only saw fit to put cinemagoers through 100 minutes of it."
" my notes
",0.0,-0.8834,2019-06-25 00:00:00,5,Had lots of funny parts but lots of stupid and annoying parts as well. they made a horrible decision on the actor for the main white guy. imagine if it was Danny McBride. (1 viewing)
" PAC-MAN IS MY FAVORITE SUPER HERO
",0.8885,0.8403,2019-06-22 00:00:00,6,"Doug Harris (Josh Gad) has a good job and is marrying a woman (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) way out of his league. Unfortunately Doug doesn't have any male friends close enough to be best man or grooms men. He lies about this to his future wife which forces him to hire them through Best Man Inc. employing the services of quick thinking golden tongue Kevin Hart. Hart hires a group of seven misfits to fill in. Doug and Hart bond during this time, while the film pays little attention to Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, in what seems to be a bad role for her.I couldn't help think that the role of Doug Harris would have been better played by a younger Jonah Hill. Kevin Hart was hit and miss during the film with the low point being the dog/peanut butter scene which was juvenile stupid. What were the writers? 14 years old? A good film for those that like dumb sex comedies that pretend to be meaningful.Guide: F-bomb. Sex talk. Brief topless flash (What was that? 1 frame?) Crass Dog/peanut scene"
" It was ok
",0.296,0.4126,2019-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Whenever I see the casting news and information for a upcoming movie, when I see Kevin Hart, I expect the same typical jokes. But the thing he really does make you laugh. This movie was no exception but in my mind doesn't deserve more than a 6. Sorry"
" You'll laugh so hard that your stomach will start to hurt.
",-0.1695,0.9901,2018-08-05 00:00:00,7,"One of the funniest movie I've seen. Kevin Hart nailed his Role in this movie. As you've seen from the Synopsis , this movie is about a loner guy named Doug who needs a best man and 7 groomsmen for his wedding .So Jimmy comes to the rescue. The comic time is on-spot.
The story is was good but not that unique. This movie is best if want to enjoy some good comedy.
If you liked the movie 'That's My Boy' , then you'll defienatly like this. Finally I want say that this movie is definitely worth your time."
" Kevin Hart equals sure laugh
",0.7096,0.9628,2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Easy, you want to have a great time and laugh? Watch any Kevin Hart movie a you'll do... not a masterpiece of comedy but has a great deal of funny moments. Perfect for a Sunday afternoon"
" Awful
",-0.4588,0.9671,2018-02-24 00:00:00,1,"This script has to have been written by an 8 year old. Both actors are generally very funny in other roles, but this is an abomination. The most far fetched unrealistic scenarios(with nothing funny to redeem them) the bachelor party, random other wedding events outside of the main plot and the closing airplane scene are just 3 examples of scenes written by writers who have never walked the earth as adults.Ridiculous and far fetched are just fine when they are funny, There is nothing funny about this movie.Avoid at all costs."
" Very enjoyable comedy - ticks all the boxes
",0.7159,0.9988,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'The Wedding Ringer' has a terrible title, but actually surprised me - it was very funny! Consistently! A very simple premise: Groom-to-be has no friends, literally has to buy a Best Man, mishaps ensue. The reason this film works is down to the two very likable leads - Gad as Doug & Hart as Jimmy/Bic. They have very different comedic sensibilities, but work great together on screen - I feel this is the first time we're seeing each of them begin to reach their potential. They're both much more charming, relaxed and believable than they were, respectively, in 'Wish I Was Here' and 'Ride Along'.The script isn't terribly inventive - it's nothing not seen in 'Hitch' or 'I Love You, Man' - but it does have a great pace, a very solid cast and never gets unfunny for too long. The ending is kind-of obvious - there's a little twist - but the 10-strong support cast (including the seven hired groomsmen) makes each scene fun to watch. Some great set pieces - meeting the family for the first time, the gridiron match, the Bucks Party, the dance-prep - which let all the cast play a part.I really enjoyed this and have to give it a good rating because the film did precisely what a comedy sets out to do - make you laugh! Sure, some stupid moments, but I definitely spent the majority of the film laughing or smiling, and there's some heart thrown in to boot. I look forward to what Hart does over the coming decade..."
" It was good.
",0.4404,0.8409,2017-10-14 00:00:00,6,"I am really astonished by Kevin Hart's performance in this movie, totally perfect. If it weren't for him, this movie would've been a train-wreck, believe me. He suited this movie as a whole.I laughed during this movie, many times, and it is enough for me to like, albeit not being the best movie of Kevin Hart.6.5~7/10"
" Not that bad starring Frozen's Josh Gad and Kevin Hart
",0.431,0.9794,2017-08-11 00:00:00,5,"The Wedding Ringer is a 2015 romantic comedy starring Josh Gad,Kevin Hart and Kaley Cucco and tells the story of a shy man named Doug(Josh Gad who I swear to god reminds me of Jack Black and Mark Ruffalo for some strange odd reason)who is set to get married to the woman of his dreams played by Cucco. But there is a problem with Doug as he is an introvert who has zero friends. So he hires a guy called Jimmy Callaghan played by Kevin Hart who poses as his BFF and Groomsman for Doug's big day. But how long can the fascade hold on for?Overall this is a decent flick. Im not really a fan of Josh Gad's to be honest but he was funny in this film alongside Kevin Hart(who is the new Chris Tucker may I add). The twist I did not see coming as it reminded me of The Break Up and Paper Towns. But yeah I say if you like Gad and Hart then check it out."
" The Hangover Mach II
",0.0,0.9336,2017-04-23 00:00:00,1,"So guy is going to marry a girl who we think loves him, (until conveniently right near the end after he met a stripper once) and suddenly she becomes a b word who we are supposed to be hoping he breaks up with. Then he does and gets with the stripper at the end. Reminiscent of it's big brother The Hangover where married guy breaks up with his ball and chain wife for a stripper he met once. Every guys dream must be to get with a stripper and have a relationship with them instead of their boring wives if the high ratings for these movies are anything to go by. As if strippers will be fun all the time and really love them after meeting them once. Throw in some hopeless friends and animals and really it is the Hangover boy movie Mach II."
" Funny and slightly sentimental at the same time
",0.6003,0.9955,2017-03-16 00:00:00,8,"The Wedding Ringer was a surprisingly enjoyable film. It had an interesting and creative plot whereby Kevin Hart had to manufacture not only a best man but a series of friends for his client, the soon to be groom. Aside from this unique plot there are many laughs and turns as the duo prepare for the upcoming wedding. Hart and Josh Gad hit it out of the park in their roles and the bromance and chemistry that is built is believable and a treat to watch. The two steal the show in a scene when they dance at somebody else's wedding. Other memorable scenes include the crew quickly filming some life memories to show at the wedding rehearsal. It also had a good sentimental balance where the duo actually form a real friendship and they begin to question a few of their life choices. What was also great was it did not include an unnecessary romance that annoyed the viewers. If you want a good laugh and a film that has some substance then you should watch this. A big improvement on the number of baseless, vulgar and stale romantic comedies Hollywood has tried to jam down our throats. A strong 7.5 out of 10."
