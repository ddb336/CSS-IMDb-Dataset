",0.63,0.9359,2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"I'll admit nine lives is a little slow, but if you and your kids are patient for it to start.Then you'll definitely love it!(If you like cats)"
" Cats life
",0.0,0.8506,2021-03-13 00:00:00,6,"Kevin Spacey as a egotistical .. I'll stop here. Now public perception of Kevin Spacey is not very kind. I'm being kind - but that doesn't change the fact that he is a great actor. The movie might not be the best example to bring that out - it is aimed at the kids. Animals pets and a very easy to follow storyline.Good versus evil with an added bit of magic. And a lot of cat humor. Can you imagine a real human being ... being in a cat? Wait did Pixar copy that for their movie Soul? I'm (partially) kidding of course ... so fun for the whole family, do not expect more from this and you'll be entertained, especially because of all the actors involved"
" A body swap comedy with a cartoony edge
",0.3612,-0.9738,2020-11-06 00:00:00,6,"A selfish and self centered billionaire (Kevin Spacey) obsesses over the build of a skyscraper as a symbol of his power and wealth and in the process neglects his family. Rushing to his daughter's (Malina Weissman) birthday he buys her a cat, but is almost killed in an attempted murder at the office that leaves him in a coma. He soon finds that his mind is in that of the cat and tries to desperately tell the family of what happened and his predicament.A standard body swap story has plenty of wit and verve. Other elements to the film are quite silly in places, while Cheryl Hines feels sadly underused as Spacey's ex-wife. It should come as no surprise that Spacey's character is possibly based off Donald Trump."
" This movie moves me a lot, and fathers should be more concerned with his family.
",0.0,0.552,2020-10-24 00:00:00,8,"After watching this movie, I was moved by many scenes and almost burst into tears. For instance, at the last part of the movie, Mr. Fuzzypants (Tom) tried to rescue his son, David from committing suicide, and he also sacrifice himself. Though Tom become alive after Mr. Fuzzypants died, this scene still makes me cry. Another scene is that Mr. Fuzzypants (Tom) tried his best to ruin his persuasion of owing the tallest skyscraper in the world and hope to spend more time accompanying his daughter, which also moves me a lot. For me, this movie makes me feel impressive, moved and realistic. Actually, the director portraits the alienation between father and his family in the modern society. In order to make a good life for his family, most of fathers try their best to earn more money so as to have a sense of accomplishment. However, they are so busy that have less time to sit with their family, and they become more and more alienate with their family. Under such situation, some conflicts or misunderstanding happened in a family and cause wounds on the relationship of a family and their father. In order to avoid such situation happens, father or a family should spend some leisure time to understand each other. So I think that the best way is to hold a family meeting regularly."

" How did they get so so wrong?
",-0.653,-0.7613,2020-04-06 00:00:00,4,"As we open, Tom Brand (a rather lethargic Spacey) parachutes onto the top of his new building to hold a quick meeting. He is celebrating the construction of the tallest building in North America, only we quickly find out it won't be. Anyway, Brand is a no nonsense, hard hitting business man and as you have already guessed, this affects his home life with his wife, and more importantly his daughter.As a yearly tradition, Brand asks his daughter what she wants for her birthday, and as always she asks for a cat. After much berating and badgering he finally caves and ends up by a freak of fate at Felix Perkins' (Walken) Purrfect Pet Store. Having bought a cat (Mr. Fuzzypants), Perkins is quick to offer some sagely advice which as you can also probably guess Brand is quick to ignore. Predictable accident awaiting, Brand is then transported into the body of Mr. Fuzzypants while his human body lies in a coma.Mr. Fuzzypants then tries his hardest to let his family know that he is indeed the cat before turning to alcohol (a good scene). And so the fun begins. Only, Nine Lives actually isn't that much fun to be honest. Whilst there are some funny dry lines voiced by Spacey, he really does seem to be collecting his pay cheque here. The rest of the cast are not much better and even Walken is not to his usual awesomeness. The special effects and CGI used for Mr. Fuzzypants are really not the best either.There are also far too many fake cat noises littered (pun intended) throughout the film and they quickly become annoying, especially when not synced. There was a lot of discussion around the net when this was first announced regarding whether it was real, and personally I was excited to see it. Kevin Spacey as a cat, Christopher Walken...what could go wrong? Well, bad script, bad effects and predictability let the film down badly.Ultimately Nine Lives has been done a hundred times before, and much better. It is the usual story of a man who has no time for his family and needs a (comical of sorts) disaster to understand his own selfishness and realise the consequences of his previous actions and what he has to lose in his life. Predictably below average stuff but young children should enjoy it.

",0.0,0.8047,2020-02-24 00:00:00,3,"I'm sorry to have to say this, but Nine Lives is possibly the worst film I have seen in my life. Look, I like cats, I like movies, I like Jennifer Garner. But this movie is bad.
The first half of the film seems to be dedicated to boring the viewer so much that the second half actually seems okay. Its all an illusion of course, the second half of the movie is in fact awful.
Why Nine Lives was made is beyond me. I would recommend watching it for the sole purpose of making you appreciate the genuinely good movies in your life."

",0.0,0.189,2020-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Not a terrible film in truth. 'Nine Lives' isn't anything grand, I won't remember it past tomorrow, but it's, relatively, an OK film; better than a lot of its genre counterparts, e.g. 'See Spot Run', 'Firehouse Dog' etc.With that said, there are many criticisms. One is the poor voiceover work, which never felt connected to any of the scenes. The comedy wasn't great either."

It's such an incompetent movie for what it's trying to be (a children's movie I suppose?) with a bunch of clashing themes, bad acting, and bad CG. You could watch a cat video compilation on YouTube for an hour and have more fun and probably learn more. All the fun I got from this is occassionally I'd remember Kevin Spacey is actually in this movie voicing a cat and have a chuckle."

",0.25,0.9755,2019-07-24 00:00:00,6,"I must say, the story and plot line were both fantastic as ever!
My downside to this review is the entertainment factor. I had to pause the movie to take a phone call, and then realized, 30 minutes after the phone call ended, that I was still supposed to be watching this movie. It did not have me hooked on enough to remember that I was watching it.
Don't get me wrong, it was kind of cool actually, with the characters and the whole set up and dialogue exchanged were really personable and seemed very realistic and natural, and some of the animations were great and some were kind of off at some points, but it was not too bad.
What I liked the most was probably the ending scenes where it all comes together and the moral of the story was so beautiful that I still hold on to it."
" Sligtly better than the recent glut of ""dogs have a purpose"" movies
",0.4404,0.4843,2019-05-12 00:00:00,7,"However, for a outstanding cat movie, look for Disney's ""The 3 Lives of Tomasina (1963). Similar to ""Just Like Heaven"" wherein Reese Witherspoon's soul is trapped as a ghost outside her comatose body, this version has a corporate CEO (Kevin Spacey) trapped in a cat's body, ""Mr. Fuzzypants"". (The alternate Australian Title.) Not well-explained is why or how the creepy pet shop owner (Christopher Walken) snatches the ""spirit"" from certain death. It must be a curse, as the poor man must ""repent"" or stay a cat forever, while his human body remains in a coma. Similar to ""Just Live Heaven"" as so many people are itching to ""pull-the-plug"". This is troubling, as he tries desperately to communicate to several people, including his 2nd wife and young daughter, that he is not dead! Some unneeded ""potty"" humor. What saves this movie for me is the extraordinary CGI and cat behaviors. Therefore, just ""purrfect"" for cable viewing. Great cast in an unoriginal script. Little kids might like it because the cat is so good! Bombed in the USA but made money overseas. Go figure?"
" Ghosts
",0.0,-0.4061,2019-04-09 00:00:00,6,"Okay, is no one going to mention that this movie and Ghost have the exact plot line, just think about it, it's the same movie with some minor tweaks! I watched the two movies back to back and I couldn't help but notice all the similarities."
" Absolutely terrible and I love cats
",0.2665,-0.9186,2019-04-02 00:00:00,3,"Nine Lives is a 2016 fantasy comedy starring Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Garner and tells the story of a selfish businessman who owns a company called Firebrand with his son(played by Robbie Amell). One day Tom gets a present for his daughter's 11th birthday of a cat named Mister Fuzzypants who he gets off a mysterious pet shop run by Christopher Walken. One night however while bringing the cat with him he gets thrown out of his own building by an employee named Ian Cox who wants to take over from Firebrand,and wakes up to find that his inside his cat's body while Tom is in a coma.
So will Tom Brand(Spacey) come out of his coma and swap back with his daughter's cat.
Overall this is one stupid film. Kevin Spacey was unlikable in this movie,poor Jennifer Garner was so out of place and the whole premise is stupid.
There is even a scene near the end where Tom's son tried to kill himself and I'm like whoa this is a kids movie and your adding a scene where a guy jumps off his own father's building are you crazy.

" Entertaining, Funny, and Emotionally Likable
",0.7003,0.9861,2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,"23 August 2016. Nine lives has a lot going for it. This movie stands out as one of the most funny of the season with great pratfalls and some great one-liners that are near pre-fect. There is a very nice build up to the transformation which most fantasy movies don't really develop much. There are some very well executed scenes of practical cat moves that are extended for per-fection. The emotional highs and lows are intense and meaningful. There are perhaps three logical flaws with the script that diminish the per-fection of the movie of (spoiler) how does the cat get out of its cage, why does the cat have to taken an alternative route to the Brand tower instead of just going with his son, and how does the son just somehow have a parachute (spoiler). Nonetheless Nine Lives is a perfect treat for young people, families, and pet lovers. This is summer Scrooge package for your summertime delight."

1. Those sounds, and meow's that the cat did all time, were extremely annoying.
2. Most of times the cat had the ""mouth"" closed and still made those sounds.I don't understand why so much hate and lots of 1 / 10 scores, because of them the movie here have a terrible and not worthy score.
The movie have also a moral and a lesson to teach us, and that is simple:
""Do not bury yourself in work, and start taking care of your family, don't ignore them or you'll die alone and sad""My score for this movie is 7 / 10"

" Adorable Cat Steals Pleasant Family Movie
",0.4939,0.906,2018-05-27 00:00:00,6,"Movies with cute animals are a guaranteed hit for families, as 'Nine Lives/Mr Fuzzypants' proves.Kevin Spacey - now a shadow of his former greatness after being dumped from ""House of Cards"" - plays businessman Tom Brand. Like most ruthless businessmen, Tom ignores his wife Lara (Jennifer Garner - a world away from her earlier action roles) daughter Rebecca (Malina Weissman) and adult son David (Robbie Amell) to build the city's biggest skyscraper. Tom buys Rebecca a cat for her birthday and - through the wonders of movie magic - is transported into the cat's body after an accident, while his real body is in a coma.CGI-enhanced hijinks ensue as Tom tries to adjust to being Mr. Fuzzypants and win his family back so he can return to his body. It's silly stuff, but Mr. Fuzzypants is the adorable star and the only reason to watch this. Tom is represented with a Garfield-style internal voice and the only human who can understand him is cat whisperer Felix Perkins (Christopher Walken), so we're spared any silly taking-animal nonsense.""Nine Lives"" is an inoffensive family film, amusing without being that funny, and driven by the adorable cat."
" Satisfactory moral fantasy
",0.3612,0.9828,2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Business tycoon Tom Brand is preoccupied with the imminent opening of his new skyscraper. But then, there's always some aspect of his business which occupies his every waking moment. That's why his first marriage failed (he is distanced from son David, who works for him), and his second is going the same way although he is, at least, prevailed upon to buy a cat for daughter Rebecca's birthday. Cat salesman Purrkins, however, is able to work a magical tweak to put Tom into the body of Mr Fuzzypants, there to remain until he learns his lesson or forever, whichever comes first. Factor the nefarious plans of executive Ian to take over the company in Tom's absence, and there are real problems ahead for Tom. Er, Mr Fuzzypants. Oh, whatever.This film, pitched at kids, is quite entertaining, but contains no surprises whatsoever for anyone who has watched this sort of film before. The story works well enough, but the script runs along tramlines. That said, the cat special effects are quite good (and the real life cats will be appealing to feliphiles), there are some decent jokes along the way, Christopher Walken as Purrkins is superb (playing straightfaced but with a twinkle in his eye) and young Malina Weissman as Rebecca is a delight. She is also the spitting image of Jennifer Warner, who plays her mother.Kevin Spacey disappoints: his reading of Mr Fuzzypants' lines could often have been improved upon (sez I, from the lofty heights of the Best Actor Oscar I haven't got).Purrkins joins a long string of god-machinery characters in juvenile fiction - Mary Poppins, Elliot in Pete's Dragon, Nanny McPhee - who spring from nowhere in order to provide magical resolutions for kids' problems. This is not a bad thing in a morality tale: children deserve magical solutions to problems. Because - note the key words from two paragraphs ago - ""Pitched At Kids."""

",0.0,-0.9785,2017-09-10 00:00:00,2,"This movie is the actual definition of having your brain dead. It fails in every way. My cat has defecated better arguments for movies than this. I never even smiled for this piece of cinematic abomination. People are saying ""Hey, its for kids"" So what? Kids need to be mentally challenged too. Imagine if the little mermaid just started by saying ""Ariel was a mermaid. And she married the prince. We are not going to tell you how, but that's the point of the movie. The end. Thanks for the money!"". That is how i felt through this entire movie.Lets start with the ""hero"" of the movie, the guy you are supposed to like (John Doe or Kevin Spacey... Seriously, what happened to you?): He is an egotistic selfish guy with anger issues that has been divorced because of how little he cares about his family, with a son that he does not care about even though they both work for the same company, a daughter that he does not care about and a new wife that he does not care about. His company makes money only for him and the rest of his employees can either shut up or go **** themselves. What does he care about? If his building is going to be the tallest building. That is the central conflict and his only interest. Completely empty and completely pointless.The daughter is, by far, the only actor that was having fun doing this abomination. She wants a cat. Thats the other conflict. A total no brainer, am I right? Buy a cat, or a dog or some pet she can enjoy. Or justify a reason why not. What does this thing does? The dad buys a cat from a weird guy (Captain Koons or Christopher Walken, What happened to you man?) And by some method never explained he is transferred or something into the cat's body. His body gets into a coma and the weird guy tells him that he has to be a good cat before he dies... In a way that I can't explain before attempting suicide.So the dad does what he can to try to tell his family he is the cat: drinking (totally deadly for a cat), writing (or almost) and being an insufferable a****** with everyone... which is as cat as you can get!Really boring if not completely stupid hi-jinks happen (I am using hi-jinks in the loosest way possible) and he becomes dad again... after killing the cat after jumping a 200 stories building. Or not. It is never explained how the cat appears at the end alive with nothing broken. And his building is the tallest at the end! Yay?.The CGI is atrocious. A blind from a pacific island could have considered it an abomination by any standard.The music never fits with the situation. It is always that wacky tune we have had in movies since Home alone.The ""villains"" are not only likable, but are justifiably angry about the attitude of their ****** boss and are actually doing a favor to the company. But **** them! said the script. And they got ****** by a deus ex machina so illegal that the pedophile matrix got an erection.With the exception of the daughter every feminine character is so pointless you could have substituted them with a broom with a cardboard drawing nailed to them and you could have gotten the same effect.For me as a cat owner, the people that thought this piece of garbage have never seen a cat outside of a kindergarten drawing.In short: for liking this movie you need to a) not know what a cat is b) have no logic in your brain c) have an IQ under zero d) being able to not notice obvious stupidity and e) like cat videos on the internet. Avoid this piece of garbage."
" Giving a positive spin on the universal fact that cats have nine lives

It is a feel-good film, and there isn't anything to criticize about the movie. Bad reviews are probably due to people expecting way too much from every other movies. Sometimes, you just have to watch a movie to enjoy the simple things.I watched it for the cats, and I wasn't disappointed. The best thing was how they captured each and every single expressions, movements and activities of cats in general and put them to use in the movie. We find ourselves wondering why cats do certain things, and this movie somehow has the answers to those questions from a fictional point of view.Watch it for the cats."

",-0.5688,0.9845,2017-08-26 00:00:00,7,"... but this is one of those body/soul switch films with a twist versus the average script about this thing. No old man getting to feel young again. No teenager in mom's body suddenly having to watch her carb intake or find out she's gained five pounds overnight.Instead, this is a silly, predictable, yet very entertaining, piece of fluff about a wealthy builder (Kevin Spacey) who manages to get trapped inside a cat's body. The cat, named Mr. Fuzzypants, spends most of the film trying to get people to realize he is really Spacey, while Spacey lies in a coma. Along the way, there is some business intrigue, as Spacey's underlings attempt to take over his company. Will Mr. Fuzzypants save the day? Jennifer Garner plays Spacey's current wife, and she looks great. Spacey's first wife, played by Cheryl Hines, wears some of the tightest clothes in history and adds just the right amount of bi... - ahem - ""crankiness"" to her role. There are some laugh-out-loud scenes, such as when Mr. Fuzzypants tries to sneak past security guards who happen to be watching cat videos.Christopher Walken, as the very weird pet shop owner, is perfectly cast. I admire anyone who can deliver his lines with a straight face, all the while wearing a three-piece green suit and bow-tie.Recommended for the silliness and fun of it all."

It reminded me of the old Disney movies I grew up with. Shaggy D.A., Herbie, Apple Dumpling Gang. You have your good guys, your bad guys, the one who seems bad but really just needs to learn whats important. I think most kids would enjoy it and there's nothing bad in it that parents have to worry about. Worst thing I can think of was a castration joke, which if a kid understands what that is already they're not going to be shocked by it. If they don't know what it is then it's going to go right over their head.Full disclosure - I do love animals, and may be partial to cats so I suppose that might make me a bit biased towards this movie so I will say if you hate cats it may not be the movie for you."

NO pathos, no earth-shattering drama. The whole thing is pretty low-key, but funny. In fact, I haven't laughed out loud so much at a movie since seeing Minions.The story isn't so much. It's been done numerous times. Man is changed in something else to witness how his life is affecting his family/job/co-workers/then changed back to himself as he experiences a transformation of his ways.The blue-eyed long hair is the star of the show with everything left by the wayside as our hero tried to get himself back into human form in time to save his company and his son from what he believes is self-destruction, little knowing the son has his own plans for saving his company from being sold from under him.The fun in this one is watching the cat go through the process. Granted a good portion of it is CGI effects, but nevertheless, it's laugh-out-loud time. Kevin Spacey's voice-overs don't hurt. Chrisopher Walken is superb as usual in the ""cat whispered"" role, offering just a ouch of eeriness. Robbie Amell as the under-appreciated son is well-played as well as underestimated.Loved it!"

The people behind this film didn't know how to make a film enjoyable for kids and adults and became too boring for kids and too juvenile for adults. Characters were either hated or bland and the effects were nothing special. Even the title wasn't clever or charming at all. Just because it has a cat, let's use the nine lives belief as the title of our boring movie.Even the Rugrats movie wasn't this incompetent, while wasn't great either, it was leagues better than this mess.

" As an overall movie, it's just terrible. As a bad movie though, it's hilarious to watch!
",-0.636,0.9274,2017-05-06 00:00:00,3,"Nine Lives is a movie about a businessman named Tom Brand who is the head of a business named Firebrand and is really wrapped up in competing with a different company for the tallest structure in New York. All of that is interrupted when his wife, Lara Brand informs him that his daughter, Rebecca's birthday is coming up and she wants a cat. So he decides to run into a cat shop and get her one, but when Tom gets inexplicably put into a hospital, the cat and Tom switch places and as a cat, he needs to convince his family that he is a good father.I knew the rumors of this being terrible going in, but when I finished watching it, I was just simply floored. I laughed throughout the entire movie and not in the way you may think. Once Tom Brand as the cat began to try to write a message to convince his family that he is the cat, I realized what I was getting myself into.This movie is essentially one long cat video from there on with some business stuff. The business bits are very uninteresting and I was just waiting for the cat portions to return so I could continue to laugh. They seem to switch between using a real cat and a CGI cat, and it is just plain hilarious to watch. I could just describe one scene and die laughing while doing so. For example, there's one where Rebecca's friend is trying to help her get a guy for some reason and the cat slaps her phone out of her hands and begins riding it over to Rebecca. That's an example of the insane cat shenanigans the movie presents.Aside from all the cat shenanigans, this movie is just terrible. For being a PG movie made for families, it does have a heavy focus on business meetings and stock markets, all of which would bore its family audience. I, for one, was bored watching these scenes. What makes the director think that kids would enjoy those parts of the movie? There are also quite a few scenes that feel out of place in a modern PG rated movie. For example, one of the characters attempts to commit suicide. In a kids film. As you can tell, the direction doesn't seem to know where to go.The sad thing about the movie is that it had a lot of potential. If we look at the cast and crew, the movie wasn't filled with a bunch of nobodies. The movie stars Kevin Spacey as Tom Brand, Jennifer Garner and Christopher Walken, all of which are well-known and talented actors. Surprisingly, they give a solid and relaxed performance throughout the entire movie which surprises me as to how they got these actors involved.Overall, this movie is just plain terrible if we just look at it as a movie. If we bring in the fact that the cat scenes were plain hysterical, I could put it in the category of so bad it's good movies with The Room and Sharknado. It is one long cat video!3/10"
" Not easy living as a family pet...
",-0.3412,0.9983,2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"When I sat down to watch ""Nine Lives"" it was because of two reasons; the first being that Kevin Spacey and Christopher Walken starred it in, while my wife was thrilled about it having Jennifer Garner on the cast list. Secondly, because the movie seemed like it actually could be fun enough, as it seemed to be much akin to ""The Shaggy Dog"" in certain aspects.And with the movie seen, I must admit that I was genuinely entertained by what writers Gwyn Lurie, Matt Allen, Caleb Wilson, Dan Antoniazzi and Ben Shiffrin came up with in terms of a story and plot. But also what director Barry Sonnenfeld managed to accomplish in terms of working with the written script.Furthermore, the ensemble of cast they had managed to get together to participate in this production was good and they did great jobs with their respective characters. Personally, though, I just think it was a shame that Christopher Walken didn't have a bigger role or more time on the screen, because he is such an amazing actor.The special effects team were also pulling their weight of the movie, as they really brought the cat to life so well on the screen. And they managed to make it look realistic and also give it such a wonderful personality and great mannerisms. And a movie such as this, if not relying on an actual cat, must of course have special effects that are realistic and believable.There is a good amount of comedy in the movie as well, which often makes you laugh. Plus, the storyline was also quite good, and actually rich in terms of detail and layers. So there is something to be enjoyed here for just about everyone.I was genuinely entertained with ""Nine Lives"", and it makes for a very easy viewing of an enjoyable movie."

He does things like parachute into an outdoor press conference. But, horrors, word comes that there will be a building in Chicago which will eclipse the Brand building when finished. This is because Tom was betrayed by a close associate, Ian (Mark Consuelos), who has designs on taking over the company. Just as Tom and his son David (Robbie Amell) are working on plans to reconfigure their own building to regain the needed height, Mr. Brand's personal landscape changes. His beautiful wife, Lara (Jennifer Garner) is greatly distressed about her hubby neglecting his youngest child, pretty grade school daughter, Rebecca (Malina Weissman). You see, Tom has forgotten her birthday and her greatest desire is for a pet cat. At the end of a long day at the office, Tom is drawn to a bizarre pet shop on the scruffy side of town where owner, Felix (Christopher Walken) works magic with his cats. Therefore, Mr F insists that Tom take Mr Fuzzypants the cat home to his daughter. Rebecca is delighted. But, before long, a thunderstorm and a big accident makes Tom and the cat switch bodies, with Mr. Brand laying in a coma at the hospital. How can this beautiful, smart cat now prevent Ian from taking charge and ruining all his plants? Wait, is that all he thinks about? Isn't Lara, David, and Rebecca most important? This purrfect, darling movie was skewered by the critics and these so called experts were culpable in preventing more folks from seeing it. What a colossal shame! The great cast, the sets, the script, and the zesty direction are terrific. Most importantly, the darling CAT, with the help, at times, of special effects, is as entertaining a screen star as they come! As soon as this review is penned, this movie fan is going to write to those lambasting movie critics and give them an earful. In the meanwhile, go get Nine Lives in the next nine minutes!"

But the kid was sick, and this is the Redbox we went home with. You make sacrifices.Aside from the boatloads of CGI, there's almost zero creative effort put into this. The switch between human and feline (and how Walken factors into it) is never explained, and there's an odd focus on corporate drama over human, although some attempts at emotion are rammed into the third act.This movie just . . . exists. It's unreal how lifeless this is, given the talent involved. Sonnenfeld's done funny before. Hell, so has Spacey and Walken. As pitiful kids fare goes, this isn't infuriating like, say, ""The Smurfs"", but it doesn't have a spark in its body.Surreal, sure. Funny? Never.4/10"

However, intending to check it before watching with him, I realised the movie is not exactly aimed at kids. Because of information on business and administration of big companies, the film seems to be designed for older spectators. Besides, although it is a comedy, several other moments showing family adult problems give the movie a more serious flavour. Another good aspect of the film is the acting of Jennifer Gardener and Kevin SPacey, which add a lot to the film. Christopher Walken, as always, does a great job. This time he plays something very similar to what he did in 'Click'. To summarise the whole things I tell you to try 'Nine Lives'."

I found myself pausing as I walked through the room where he was watching, sitting down on the couch, turning to the TV and laughing all the while. Many funny lines delivered with dry comedy by Kevin Spacey as Tom Brand. Indeed all the acting was very good-- Jennifer Garner as his kind wife, Christopher Walken as the 'cat whisperer', Mark Consuelos as the slimy villain, and Robbie Amell as the adult son and Malina Weissman as the sweet younger daughter. The premise is preposterous of course, and some say you have to be a cat-lover (which I am) to like it, but its not really about cats per se. Some films intended for the same demographic, --cough---BFG, Storks --cough-- I found completely unwatchable, yet they got higher reviews.

The simple but strong bond between Tom Brand and his son truly reminded me that there is nothing more important than family. The moment I finished this film I got the first bus from my office in LA to Dallas. I phoned my father and we spoke for the first time in months.

I really had low expectations coming into this. It turns out not to be as horrible as I figured. It's still not good but there are compelling aspects. The drama of the company takeover has its moments. It is missing the needed humor. The comedic attempts all fall flat. The ending isn't good either.

It was amazingly lighthearted and fun for something with such potentially dire consequences. The plot was predictable as was the moral, but it's a family film. If adults aren't smarter than ten year olds, we've done something wrong. The film had a few clever moments and bits, I was never bored. Probably partly because they got Kevin Spacey and CHRISTOPHER WALKEN in a kids film! WALKEN was wonderful. My only critique is that I would have liked a longer denouement. I'd wager money that the original script had a father son moment at the end that was cut. A shame. I also would have liked to see what happened to the board. If you want a family friendly, or just a giggler, go for it and ignore the bored elitist reviews. ;-)"

I was astonished to see her. It is incoherent, silly, no character provokes empathy, all without exception, Kevin Spacey save because his character is already trying to be hateful. Jennifer Garner plays the role of a bland woman, rotten with money but humble, sweet and useless. The girl, meh, is not made to like but not to hate, very bland. Perhaps the character of Christopher Walken is also saved. It looks like a TV movie, it's not long but you can do it.

I even expected it to be. But it's not an excuse for it to be horribly executed. If you want a headache this movie is for you!From the first minutes you can see that the whole movie is visually unpleasing from all this CG camera shots that are zooming in and out at a too fast pacing. For example: Spacey is going to base jump from an airplane - It's zooming out and into a building - Spacey stands at the door of the room. It also looks utterly terrible because it's so unbelievably over-saturated. I still can't believe how this can be so badly acted with such an amazing and talented cast (partly). Spacey always seems like he's reading his lines as a cat and everything else is just passable.The characters are... not likable. And confusing. The wife is best friends with the ex of Spacey and they both have children and they also are sort of friends?! I don't get it.The story is also all over the place. It's about family, pets, family business, kids in these situations, cheating... and many more. And the most boring part is that all of it is predictable. It would have been nice that they at least try to edit it correctly because of the ability to have both a human voice and a cat voice... but no. It's all over the place. The voices always cut each other, the sound engineering is too loud and obnoxious for the cat while Spacey is always calm and seemingly whispering. There is absolutely no momentum between each shot. Like the girl hears that her father could possibly die and in the next scene she's dancing and playing with her cat. Like what? What is happening...This would have been right if the tone was like that but in another scene two security men try to taser a cat just because it looked like the one from a video. There are always videos from the cat. No idea how they got on the Internet but they are shot just like the scenes of the movie. Right after that even suicide is implied. I've been confused and disgusted.There were some good scenes like the cat being drunk where i caught myself laughing with it or the dark humor elements that came completely out of nowhere.2/10 - watchable for 2-4 year old's because they will remember it just as long as i did."

" Painfully unfunny and lifeless to the core, Nine Lives is definitely not worth it
",-0.3326,0.996,2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"Kevin Spacey switching bodies with a furry feline under a magic spell by Christopher Walken? This sounds like an idea that would leave many scratching ideas and struggling to understand why this would be a solid idea. Considering this Academy Award-fueled roles in 'Usual Suspects' and 'American Beauty' and his highly appealing role in the Netflix series 'House of Cards, you would expect Spacey to make choices that at least sound wholesome regardless of whether the roles sits in the mature or family-friendly category. But it comes to show that even the most versatile actors in Hollywood must have a few hiccups in their filmography. If Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Garner, and Christopher Walken have hit their all-time lowpoints in their careers, each of them would fall under this excruciatingly soulless body-swap comedy that lacks both the charm and laughs to contend for a wholesome family comedy. And to matters worse, it sees Barry Sonnenfield, the man behind the 'Men in Black' trilogy taking the director's chair. So this film stars Kevin Spacey as Tom Brand, the CEO working with his adult son David (played by Robbie Amell) for a billion-dollar architect company that is competing to build the tallest building the U.S. The problem is he takes time for his wife Lara (played by Jennifer Garner) and his daughter Rebecca (played by Maline Weissman) who's 11th birthday on the horizon. And the worst part is Rebecca wants a cat for her birthday which he has great disdain for. Regardless, Tom visits the pet store ran by the mysterious Felix Perkins (played by Christopher Walken) to purchase a cat, only to be unexpectedly struck by lighting causing him his body to fall into a coma while his soul is transferred into the body of a cat named Mr. Fuzzypants.Yes, the concept of this film is weirder than it sounds. While the idea could work fairly well on paper if you were writing a children's book, the execution of this concept on the silver screen comes off in a way that is just abysmal. The material director Barry Sonnenfield presents here is not only too goofy and far below the standards of an charismatic actor like Kevin Spacey (or Christopher Walken), but fails to meet the criteria of a movie targeted at the elementary school-aged demographic. In short words, it simply doesn't know how to be funny, at least not in a way that is fairly appropriate for children. With humor ranging from divorce, to a brief castration joke, to a series of loony slapstick gags perpetrated by Spacey in cat form, to other jokes that are simply too morbid for a family-friendly fare. It is difficult to recount any of them being even remotely funny. When the film is not being funny, you are forced to sit through a series of numerous corporate board meetings as if children or even adults are supposed to sip some fun out of that (I mean really?). And before too long, it traps you into a soulless experience likely to evoke far more yawning than laughter. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Garner, and Christopher Walken have all proved themselves worthy doing comedies in the past. Though none of them were necessarily cult classics, they at least had a decent amount of charm. If this film has any strong point, it may be the message of how family is important and part of being a family is sacrificing your time for them, but even that is far from enough to save this movie from being an 87-minute snoozefest.Nine Lives is a painfully unfunny and lifeless comedic farce that places just about everyone in the cast on their all-time lowpoints. In the end, it is a highly forgettable family flick that is far from worth your time regardless if you are a cat lover or not. Hollywood has plenty of charming family films in the market with charm and laughter for families to embrace, but Nine Lives is not one of them."
" Possibly the funniest kitty movie ever plus a marvelous cast
",0.8176,0.7768,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"At any given time there is a dearth of decent comedies. Add to the mix of those who enjoy good/excellent comedies those who love cats and we now have a large segment of movie goers. This review is for YOU! Nine Lives is pure comedic, kitty 'magic' on many levels. Casting was superb with wife Jenifer Garner, billionaire absentee father Kevin Spacey, Christopher Walken as the over of the 'mystical' cat shop and 11 year old daughter (14yo in real time) Malina Weissman. Melina is 13 going on 30 based on her acting, stage presence and fabulous teen looks. Last but not least is kitty FuzzyPants. CGI together with a hilarious script had us rolling on the floor.The premise finds inattentive dad Spacey inhabiting the body of FuzzyPants while his real body is lying on a hospital bed. He will need to redeem himself if he is to once again become human.Very non-juvenile story involving corporate take-overs/back stabbing and Spacey's failure as a dad. Like icing on a 'family' cake.Just one example is FuzzyPants (inhabited by Spacey) attempting to write a message with a pen and his 'battle royale' to get the pen's cap off. Both the story and comedy never abate from start to finish.See this film and laugh yourself silly. Unless, of course, you don't like the cast and/or you are allergic to cats."
" Nowhere near as bad as these ""pro"" critics say..don't listen to them
",0.1655,0.9114,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Great cast, very funny, great acting, perfect story!! Yea, it had help with computers but what movie doesn't. My 5 year old Daughter absolutely loved it!! She laughed so hard and now has to watch it all the time! You can't help but love a movie that has that affect on your child. These so-called ""professional"" critics have not a clue! They had to got paid to give such horrible ratings! They have no idea what good family fun means!! Of course it's no Dark Knight or Forest Gump but you should know what you're getting when you see a cat on the cover and I was greatly surprised at the movie. Watch it, your whole family will love it!!"
