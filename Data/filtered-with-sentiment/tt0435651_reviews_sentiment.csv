" Wow
",0.5859,0.7783,2021-04-08 00:00:00,10,This movie was amazing. I haven't found a movie in years that could hold my interest. I couldn't even get up to go to bathroom.
" Just read the book, people
",0.0,0.2023,2021-04-03 00:00:00,4,"Like Seriously, the book is spectacular. The movie, not
so much."
" This is not the book you loved
",0.5994,0.9245,2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,"I absolutely loved the books. Until the first half of the movie I was very disappointed to find out that it is nothing like the book. I had to give up on comparing them and recognise the film as an independent piece of work to appreciate it. I think for someone who hasn't read the book, the movie could be a 9star choice.Judging it as an adaptation, I have mixed feelings. You don't really get the full picture from life in the community, but the black and white screen kind of fills in the gaps. I think that social profiling remained purposefully blare, so that the characters could be able to act and react differently. I caught myself often thinking 'you couldn't possibly have this kind of reaction in the book'. Although the plot is so different, it holds the general idea from the original work and it succeeds to pass on to the viewer the same thoughts and feelings as the book. The plot had to be sacrificed to go to the big screen.. so the idea and the message only survived, the story is overwritten. So the book didn't make it to the big screen, it's soul did. This is either a zero or a ten star accomplishment -considering one's point of view."
" Wonderful Movie
",0.5719,0.8829,2021-04-02 00:00:00,9,"I just rewatched this movie. It's one of my all time favorites. Heartwarming, interesting, it's lost nothing since I first watched it. It is also very true to the book which is also a favorite of mine. How can anyone not like this movie."
" He couldn't even hold water
",0.0,-0.296,2021-03-26 00:00:00,2,"You get a job and the one thing they tell you is to not say anything and the first thing he wants to do is tell everything. Yeah, that was stupid to me. Next movie."
" The Crapper
",0.0,-0.2518,2021-03-03 00:00:00,3,"A disdainful, stupid stain on really fantastic source material. The first three books were really good (2nd was a bit less, but still) and I hope they make films out of those, and remake the first because this sucked. The 4th book is worse than this film, so that can be left alone. But THE GIVER deserves a cinematic adaptation that's on its level."
" A world without suffering, devoid of joy.
",0.7472,0.8757,2021-02-06 00:00:00,9,"The film based on the 1993 young adult novel of the same name by Lois Lowry. First of all I want to say that I haven't read the book. And due to this I will not compare them. I will only appreciate the film, not referring to the events in the book. The Giver is a drama, romance and science fiction. I believe that it has an exciting plot and well-paced script. The stars of this movie are Jeff Bridges (awarded an Academy Award in 2010) and Meryl Streep (Won three Oscars and nine Golden Globes).The action takes place in a world divided into communes. The world is devoid of color, people don't remember about their history and previous way of life. Society follows strict rules and no one asks questions. Without realizing it, people kill premature babies and frail old people by lethal injection. They call the process ""released to Elsewhere"". And only 2 people fully know what real life is: the Receiver of Memory and his apprentice.At the annual distribution ceremony, teenagers who graduated from school were given appointments. The protagonist named Jonas has become the new Receiver of Memory. Brenton Thwaites plays the role and for this film he won the Australian in Film Breakthrough Award in category 'Up-and-coming talent'. Now the fate of the whole world depends on his actions. Whether he can humbly accept the memories or decide to return them to people. But along with this, pain, wars and suffering will return.I would especially like to mention the work with color. I was fascinated by the planned transition from black and white to full color. It's an impressive piece of work, something I've never seen anywhere else. In my opinion you should watch this movie at least once in your life. You may not be ecstatic, but the evening will definitely be well spent."
" The ultimate feel good movie
",0.4404,0.9081,2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,So the storyline itself is a complete mirror of divergent. I don't know which one came first so I won't say copy. However it's full of emotion and feel good moments that make you realize how great life is. If you like feel good movies you should watch this.
" Great film but still had a lot more potential
",0.3716,0.9684,2021-01-08 00:00:00,7,"I cannot even begin to express my feeling about this film, I passionately believe it could have been so much more. It was amazing up until he end of the film. The whole ending I thought was so unsatisfying and it didn't make much sense. It was almost like it didn't really fit with the rest of the film. The idea was that the protagonist had to cross some sort of border and doing so will give everyone in the ""Community"" back the memories of the past, this is done with no explanation or hint to how the border works or why it is there in the first place. Of coarse the book of this film is quite well known which I didn't find out until after watching. So film probably stays true to the book but here are a few things I thought could of made the plot and film a masterpiece. To start with a sort of sinister vibe is given off of the entire place, from the mass surveillance of the community and recording of conversations to injecting people to take away their emotions, however the film didn't really live up to that vibe. The whole film was building tension around the idea that the leader and authority of the place could turn on him at any moment, but eventually when that time comes all that happens is a small chase through the hospital ward where the protagonist escapes very easily without much resistance. This totally removes the feeling of uncertainty as the authority/antagonists are now perceived to have a lot less power than than previously thought. After the escape not much actually happens and the protagonist doesn't really face any more obstacles. I think it would of been better if the film focussed on the protagonist being a fugitive within the community, having to survive and escape with the ones he loves. Again there really wasn't much the authority of the community actually did to live up to the suspense that was built. Perhaps if one of the characters were killed off(such as Jeff Bridges character) to cause an emotional reaction from the audience this could achieve that, also it would be linking to the emotional awakening of the characters. So as the characters experience more emotion so does the audience. Overall good film I would defiantly recommend it, I just wish that the film took a different direction towards the end."
" Hidden Gem.

" Bad Lois Lowry adaptation
",-0.5423,0.867,2020-11-14 00:00:00,4,"Where to begin with this movie. First off, the writing here is pretty bland. While the book had a beautiful story, which kind of reminded me of a mix between Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse and Avatar: The Last Airbender, about a boy who has a unique power but doesn't think he's worthy enough, and goes through lots of stress knowing that the power of freedom is in hands, the movie just uses that story and made it as boring and corny as possible. Though, I will admit, it could've been worse. Secondly, the acting is pretty bad. The actors just look so bored when playing their roles. I mean, I can't blame them, the writing's pretty bad. But scenes like the ceremony, the Jonas' actor had such a poker face! In the book, Jonas was devastated when (SPOILERS WITHELD), but in the movie, HA! There was literally no expression. And I don't remember the Giver being so depressing to be around. Thirdly, the editing was pretty good. I liked how they improved on the description of Jonas' community by shooting almost the ENTIRE movie in black-and-white. I didn't know that there was no color until halfway in the book! And also, I liked the camera angles. Fourthly, and the biggest issue in this movie is, the pacing. This movie has HORRID pacing. The movie just goes way too fast for me to handle. I mean, by the fifteen minute mark of the movie, we're already halfway through the book! And this movie is 1 hour and 37 minutes! Overall, I would not recommend this movie. If you want a good Lois Lowry movie adaptation, watch The Willoughbys on Netflix. It is much better."

" A world with no pain
",-0.6705,0.9651,2020-09-18 00:00:00,5,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the sci-fi flick based on the book, The Giver (2014), where everyone lives in peace due to not knowing or having emotional feelings therefore have no clue about war, pain, suffering, differences or choice - even pandemics ðŸ˜‰. Soon a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the ""real"" world. So the movie starts in a black and white style story where people are drugged in order to live in their equalitarian society and have no past memories of what may have transpired. There are established rules of politeness enforced by a council by the big brother style Elders and people must obey, which they do to a tea. Jonas, who already feels different from his peers, is appointed to a Receiver role during his graduation. He must be trained by the Giver, played by Jeff Bridges, where the Giver telepathically passes memories of the world before. Slowly and quickly Jonas learns emotions such as love, fear, excitement, loss and the concept of family. This does not do well with the Chief Elder, played by the queen herself Meryl Streep who discovers what may bring chaos to a civil society.So - the movie? It does have a good message both transpired with the sad score along with the dialogue by each actor which invites the idea around the thought of doing better and ensuring we are emotionally engaged both intelligently and humanely. Both Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep do well as expected however Bridges is my favourite with his gruff approach in his scenes where he shows his vulnerability and his mission to ensure change does occur. His sarcastic and straight to the point approach helps enhance the story more and gives the story more gravity. Jonas, played by Brenton Thwaites, does well and his chemistry with Bridges is fine however does overreact in some parts. I felt that this relationship between the two was rushed. Streep's character is not a typical evil character, she brings order and the notion of not making past mistakes which will bring hurt and turmoil to the current civil society. Her monotone expression is smart as it fits in with what the movie itself presents.The filmmakers are smart with the transition from black and white to colour scenes as it showed what the characters were able to see. The problems for me was the pacing - wayyyy too quick, felt way rushed. We know the reason why the elders choose to stick with the current new world order, but we don't hear it from them, nor do we know who they were in the past. Jonas rediscover the old natural world, no matter how beautiful and ugly it was, and contrast Instead of a good story we are fed more around the visuals and some set pieces and grand designs. Overall an average film, which had potential given the cast in the movie but instead CGI was invested more into the story of the film 5/10"
" Not a horrible movie, but NOT The Giver
",-0.1603,-0.2617,2020-08-25 00:00:00,3,"This movie could have been worse as far as movies go, but I read the book it's based on and this movie simply isn't it."
" Underrated
",0.0,0.8652,2020-08-23 00:00:00,7,It's such a unique concept not too deep to be an Sci fi though which I loved! Good looking cool acting cast! Give it a try
" Don't Judge a Movie by Its Book
",0.0,0.9667,2020-08-02 00:00:00,10,"One thing to consider before watching this film: Lois Lowry, the author of the book it's based off of, genuinely loves this film. In fact she feels like it is better in some ways. If she likes it that much, then it's certainly worthy of being viewed with an open mind.If the book hadn't been written and this movie was the first time this story had been told, it would have at least a 7 or 8 star rating. People are comparing it to the book and their prior expectations too much.Considering this adaptation of less than 2 hours is very impactful, and captures the most important aspects of the book, I think it's a great adaptation.One thing it really takes advantage of is the visuals. The way it utilizes color, black and white, and even faded color to show the story's progression is such a clever idea.Some say the film isn't dark enough. It's exactly what it needs to be for the story to work, especially in the way it shows how horrible things can be without emotion. Could it have been darker? Of course. Would that have made the film better? I don't think it would. This film encourages you to think and apply things to real life. No need to be shown more and more darkness when we can already envision that happening in our own real world.Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep are fantastic in their roles and really help carry the impact of what's happening. In fact, I like the performance of all the main actors. It's challenging to portray characters who only show fleeting feelings rather than lasting emotions, but they were quite successful.Ultimately, I consider this film to be underrated and it has not gotten the respect it deserves due to preconceived ideas from people who read the book. Movies will never capture the same magic of the book they're based off of, but this film is a great representation of the ideas and thoughts presented in the book."
" A romanticized Hollywood-ized version of the book
",0.2263,0.9473,2020-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Having read the book quite recently the essence of it, as I perceived it, is still fresh. I would rate the book an 8/10 - I truly enjoyed and respected it, but I am not a hardcore fan.That being said, the main pylons of its plot are all here, in the movie, but the way they are presented and put together feels... wrong, the message is watered down. It loses its spark of genius, it lacks its original depth - which is highly ironic as depth of feeling is one of the main themes.The book was a multi-faceted pondering on what makes us human, whilst the movie is more like a spoon fed adequately-acted pleasantly-displayed conclusion. All the same elements are there and the elements are beautiful on their own, of course, but they didn't elevate nor meet the material provided, instead they made it a cheesy simplistic version of itself.With a different adaptation watching this movie really could have been, should have been a memorable experience.ðŸ™ƒ Safe to say this was not."

" A very good film, aside from the simple story
",0.4927,0.8137,2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"When I initially watched this film I disliked the way it ended and the simple (slightly overused at this point) story line. Upon re-watching, I was less critical and I truly appreciated the incredible acting, coloring used to move the story, and overall flow of this movie. The movie makes you think a about what it would be like to give up some of what makes us human in order to ""fix"" ourselves. Bad things are bad, butThe movie still is a bit simple and some of the concepts portrayed trip over themselves at times. However this movie is still a very enjoyable movie that may get you to think about humanity a little deeper.Also if you enjoyed the book, I think you will definitely like the movie. It builds on some of the things in the book that were not quite as flushed out as they could have been.Story: 4

" Hollywood needs to stop giving dark subject matter the family film treatment
",0.0772,0.6121,2020-06-02 00:00:00,6,"The book this movie is based on, gave off the vibe that the writings of George Orwell did. Concepts such as totalitarian society, no freedom of expression, no individuality, no privacy, and a world where conformity was expected and not to be questioned. While Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep's performances were some of the best in their modern careers, Brenton Thwates was not the right casting as Jonas. At least Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard gave performances like the characters they were supposed to be playing, but they were boring and wooden even for a movie with this kind of source material. As I said the book was a cautionary tale on the type of society that could arise from civil unrest and conflict, a message we need more then ever today. This movie did what holes did and watered down and sanitized the darkness, graphic imagery, and emotion of the book and made it into a family film which is not what it should be. The ending although ambiguous like in the book was still yet another generic happy ending. Hollywood needs to stop giving dark subject matter the family film treatment."
" Flawed and unconvincing
",0.0,0.9884,2020-04-11 00:00:00,5,"I don't think a 6.5 is an apt rating, To me it should be between 5 and 6.Full marks to the concept per say but a really flawed execution. A picture perfect society seemed like a movie set and didn't really absorbs you inside it. Movie travel from Black and white to color as part of story, that too is not as seamless as I wished.Acting is unconvincing, the protagonist digested comparatively easily some of the shocks which could have caused mild seizure to outright revulsion. The movie talked about pain but it really does not live it and more or less is used as a point rather than range.Climax was dramatic but to be honest by then I was not paying full attention either.To say that movie consist art is a ruse, it does talk about art, I guess all picturesque stuff are not art it's just pleasing to eyes in many frames to put it correctly.The female love interest was eye candy and brought freshness. But I wish movie as a whole should had more soul, could have developed more and may have improvised more to keep it interested. But then I think I was disappointed more coz I expected more. Just go with little expectation and it could be gratifying."
" Great story line & actors
",0.6249,0.8814,2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,Great story and acting in this movie. The story is really original and the ending plausible and could lead to The Giver ll. I'd love to see it! Some may not like this movie but I've seen it more than once and did very much. Send me Part ll pleases!
" Respectful adaption
",0.4588,0.9914,2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I'm pleasantly surprised that Hollywood chose to respect the source material instead of butchering it to the point where it's virtually unrecognizable as the same story. Jeff Bridges is the perfect choice to play The Giver! (In fact, when I read the book, I pictured him as Jeff Bridges. Apparently great minds think alike.) While it doesn't have nearly as much meat to the story as the book did it still gets the point of the story across. 1 hour and 30 minutes was a much shorter runtime than it should have been. They should have added at least another hour, and given more detail about the society in which the characters live. We're briefly given a list of their rules, but not enough detail as to how this society came to be. Some important parts were cut out of the movie or changed slightly, which is why you really must read the book first. However you can still understand most of it if you choose to see the movie before you read the book. While at times it does feel like it took inspiration from (read: stole) certain parts of the film adaptions of other YA novels such as ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent,"" keep in mind that the book of ""The Giver"" was written long before these other novels; it just took longer to make it. It's well worth the 20 year wait though, because this film adaptation is nearly perfect. It's probably the best book-to-film adaptation I've seen since the ""Harry Potter"" series. I'm hoping Jeff Bridges gets nominated for his role in this film, because he's absolutely phenomenal. And so is the film.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
" Good Adaptation of the Novel
",0.6369,0.9885,2020-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Stellar cast and stellar adaptation of an excellent YA novel (1993 by Lois Lowry) that spawned modern era dystopian genre. Beautifully shot when the city got their memories back and the color came back, including the colorful people. Excellent visual metaphor of how safe ""Sameness"" can be, but the cost is the lack of emotional depth. I thought it was cute that Taylor Swift made a cameo. I also enjoyed the performance by the lead actor who played Jonas. If you are an ultimate optimist who still holds that humanity can be salvaged, then you will enjoy this movie adaption of the 1993 novel, The Giver by Lois Lowry. This movie adaptation was a long time in coming."

I found the story dull and in need of some kind of action or romance. That was the point of the community though. One day, I randomly found the giver movie. I decided to watch it and went into the movie thinking I would hate it. It had a good cast and they all brought a small part to this story. With the visuals and added moments in the movie, it tops the book BY FAR. Sometimes I laughed, sometimes I cried but this movie is one that you should totally watch right now."

It has to do with the government controlling a small community telling them what they can and can't say. Ex: When the kid asks dad do you love me the mother says ""such things are not to be spoken of."". They are told where and when they can or can't go. They are told ""given"" (told) what career they will take on after they graduate from high school. One boy is ""chosen""as the current Givers apprentice so that he can assume his responsibilities. It is mostly based on the high school graduates and how a few want to escape the tyranny in which they live. They have to make moral decisions that the government wouldn't approve of. Take risks. They do get to ride around on cool bikes once they reach a certain age. This was a terrific movie! It has won awards and been up for nominations. How could this movie get a 6.5!!? It's a10. Maybe because of the poorly written movie description people were expecting something other than what they got? Fun movie!"

" Worth a watch in a crowded YA sci-fi field
",0.2263,0.9904,2019-05-20 00:00:00,7,"The film starts with cool black and white cinematography and quickly hooks us into wondering what's going on in this slick utopia. Obviously strongly inspired by Aldous Huxley's work, it's not the most original film (adapted by a young adult sci-fi novel which I admit I've never read) but it is much better than a lot of the others out there today that lack some of the stronger social, political and humanism themes I enjoyed exploring in this film. As the conflict and drama start to take hold, the allegory begins feeling glib and the ending a bit rushed for the heaviness of the subject matter. I'm giving this Brave New World knock-off a 7/10 for good acting, beautiful sets and cinematography, and an interesting take on colour design and it's association to human feelings and passion."
" Terrible adaptation
",-0.4767,-0.8613,2019-05-06 00:00:00,1,"I teach seventh grade English. I've taught The Giver novel for the last eighteen years. This film is NOT the book, not by a long shot. One of the main theses of the book (perception regarding color) was completely ignored. The main character's best friend was turned into a villain in the movie. The Chief Elder, who appeared in once scene in the book, is also a major villain in the film, and not necessary. The most grievous sin the film commits, however, is aging the main character from twelve years old to eighteen (although the actor looks 25). The horrors that happen to the main character are horrific because the child is twelve. The same events happening to an adult don't hold the same impact.
The producers took forever making this movie. You'd think they'd be faithful to the plot, characters, and themes. Shame on them for ruining a perfect book by changing everything so much, the story is completely different. It would have been simple to make a true adaptation. The producers of this film blew it, big time."
" Not as i expected :(
",0.3412,-0.9374,2019-04-28 00:00:00,4,"I didn't read the book, but anyway I didn't enjoy in this movie, the performance was normal nothing special, I like some concepts in the movie like the idea by going from black and white to colors, which colors indicate to emotions, but nothing impressive and the actions of movie don't give you suspense or enjoy, if you like these type of movies you can watch ""divergent"" or ""the hunger game"" more better than ""the giver"""
" Wasted Potential
",-0.4939,0.9371,2019-04-05 00:00:00,5,"There is a lot to like about The Giver. It isn't a new idea nor is it executed in any special way however it's still an idea full of potential that builds to a very anticlimactic ending.Despite the big name cast, the acting is average with a couple solid performances by Cameron Monaghan and Odeya Rush. Jeff Bridges also takes centre stage with his presence and gruff charm.It feels like so much more could be done with this but at the end it was like the screenwriter had painted themselves into a corner and didn't know a way out.I have not read the source material.

" Not Oscar material, but pretty good
",0.8462,0.6893,2019-04-04 00:00:00,7,"I'm ambivalent about reviews that pan a movie by comparing it with the book. I see a movie rating as an assessment of the movie, period. If one wanted to conduct a comparative study, that needs a separate metric because it conveys different information. If you start mixing ratings that assess the movie on its own with ratings that compare the movie with the book, then the rating becomes less meaningful because, again, they measure different things.The movie was quite good. Not spectacular, but I like the way they started corny, then revealed the gravity of the societal problems with time. In particular, the seriousness of the things that were so blithely referred to at the start. The old guy was melodramatic at times. I think that there is enough argumentation for both sides of how humans should live to give people pause about whether one way is that much better than the other. That's a good thing.Having said that, there are loopholes that a truck can be driven through. They require no description, as the viewer will automatically ask themselves ""why does doing such-and-such cause thingy-thing to happen? Striking even deeper into the heart of realism, why would societies set up in certain ways flourish when one would expect them to fall behind in the course of world-wide darwinism?"

" The Giver: An Off-Brand Dystopian Film
",0.34,0.9807,2019-01-17 00:00:00,3,"If you have not had enough of the trending futuristic movies, and thought the novel The Giver was worth your time, there is the film to go along with it. Just as Star Trek attempted to win over the sci-fi future gurus by replicating the means of success of the classic Star Wars series, The Giver film tries desperately to emulate its predecessor, Divergent. Although it indeed succeeded in grabbing the attention of those with no standards, director Phillip Noyce failed in nearly all other aspects.The film is set in a small, futuristic, dystopian community positioned next to a quaint river. Main character Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) has lived his whole life in a society where harsh rules are set and freedom is limited, because, you know, it's the future. Jonas has been selected as the ""chosen one,"" as he is different from others (some may call him, divergent, perhaps?). His job is to visit this old sag who holds all of the memories of life in the past, and who transfers such memories to Jonas. They call him - say it with me! - The Giver.While actor Brenton Thwaites does an excellent job of not only maintaining, but drawing in the attention of the audience, the plot fails to do so. Stop me if you have heard this one before: Young teenage rebel looks at the rules that society has set for them, and decides to act upon it, featuring a romantic side story that is trying to be kept a secret. It is as if my 10-year-old unimaginative cousin was told to write a story after having seen Divergent, Insurgent, Allegiant, and all of the Hunger Game movies in a row. Honestly!I will give props to Mr. Noyce, however, for deciding to portray the film in black and white. However annoying it may be to the audience for a while, it captures adequately just how much freedom is taken away from the citizens without their knowledge, even something as basic as color. Other than this facet, the special effects do by no means deserve the term ""special."" The scenes featuring Jonas and The Giver alone should be the most climactic scenes. However, nothing in the music, absence of sound, lighting, camera angle, etc. during such scenes screamed ""IMPORTANT!"" or merely whispered ""Hey you should maybe watch this part."" Maybe next time, lord help us all if there is a next time, the editors should considering not working under the influence.Just as clichÃ© as the plot is, the romantic story is no different. Jonas has had a childhood best friend named Fiona (Odeya Rush), whom he sees nearly every day. He begins falling for her, except, believe it or not, his affectionate feelings for the woman of his dreams (literally, he has a sexual dream about her), are torn to shreds by society's norms and rules. That is, no touching of other people is allowed, and one must receive feeling-suppressing injections every morning. So basically, the people are emotionless robots living in a community where they are told what to do and when to do it. No room for smooches in that plan!If you are looking for a good brand of tissues, I would refer you to Kleenex, not some sleazy, cheap knock-off brand. You know, the kind that your underpaid third grade teacher buys for the classroom that feels like sandpaper. Well if you are looking for any movie in the category of dystopian community with the main character of Jonas, I would still not recommend The Giver. So, there ya have it."
" A Solid Sci Fi Young Adult Movie
",0.1531,0.9964,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"16 June 2016. The Giver offers up a simple but focused and thrilling sci fi experience including two A-Listed Actors: Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep. The script appears to take elements from the vicarious you are there experience of Natalie Wood's Brainstorm (1983) sci fi thriller, the black and white motif of the fantasy comedy of Jeff Daniel's Pleasantville (1998), and the out of place youth in the more recent sci fi move of George Clooney's Tomorrowland (2015). The Giver also include concepts from Charlize Theron's sci fi thriller Aeon Flux (2005) of seemingly contented world with a dark underbelly or the different boy in a seemingly rational futuristic world in Harrison Ford's sci fi action adventure Ender's Game (2013).What's unusual about The Giver is that the plot is concentrated on a boy who is offered to become a special person in a world where nobody is supposed to special. The really doesn't depend overly on exciting action so much as the more fascinating mental challenge of opposing cultural norms and experiencing an entirely different worldview. The movie's theme is consistently on display and the emotional ties in this more of less uplifting movie is pleasant and thrilling on the senses. An enjoyable, worthwhile movie about the willingness to go beyond and believe in something more."
" BRAVE NEW DIVERGENT WORLD

It is an artificial society that appears to be black and white. When the students graduate (Hint at target audience) they are assigned professions based on their observed talents. Jonas was special and is to receive special training from ""The Giver"" (Jeff Bridges who never says ""man"" or ""dude""). Jonas is to learn pain, emotion, and be given memories of the past world and life, the good, the bad, and the ugly.Following the formula, Jonas believes this clean utopian society is worse than the world we lived in and sets out to change things.This is another teen saves the world film. Fans of Divergent, Hunger Games, etc. should find interest in this picture. The film spent a lot of time in the beginning setting up the world and getting Jonas into training. The end felt hurried and I suspect dragged out longer in the book. With fifteen minutes left, I was thinking it should have another thirty to forty minutes to go.Yes this is another deep profound utopian society film that asks the same questions as all the other deep profound utopian society films.I felt it was overrated at PG-13. No swearing, sex, or nudity. Infant is given an injection to kill it. Boy punched in face. Flashes of war scenes."

The ending in the book was tended to be ambiguous and should have stayed that way! The whole journey out of the community was supposed to be a sole focus on Jonas. There were characters that were given much larger roles than the book had, taking focus off of the whole point of the book. Not to mention the fact the teenagers were supposed to be 12 not 16 and there was no love triangle in this book. It was unneeded and unnecessary.There were so many important elements from the book that were missing. If you're a lover of the book you'll be sorely disappointed.

It almost felt as if he was a rebel going against he grain.The beginning tries to tie in a relationship between 3 friends where love of course concurs all but it left a feeling of confusion towards the end.A short movie that could have had more done to it if they added 30 minutes to try to explain why the main character seeks for the outer circle.I guess the Giver was never really giving.

" Very disappointing
",-0.5413,0.891,2018-08-04 00:00:00,3,"I saw this movie at school, after having to write an essay on the book, which I did enjoy. While the book had some level of intelligence, the movie fails to capture it.I will give credit where credit's due, because The movie isn't an utter failure. I enjoyed Jeff Bridges' performance as well as the way they play with color. I believe the latter one is particularly interesting because it actually has some significance plot-wise.The biggest problem with this movie is that they completely mess up the characters and what their purpose is in the story. In this world, only two people are actual characters: the Giver and Jonas; they're the only ones who can actually FEEL. Everyone else is essentially an empty slate, which is fine considering the context. 
The movie fails to comprehend this point and gives way to much importance to every other character in the community. 
This movie could have focused on the relationship between the Giver and Jonas, the only characters that should be able to have relations, but they don't do that. Instead, they choose to include a generic love interest that really doesn't add anything and could have not been there at all. 
By over-developing the useless characters, it really hurts our connection to the more important ones.In conclusion, this movie is pretty bad; the pacing is off, the music sucks, the acting was ehh, but most of all, the characters where handled poorly."

",-0.1027,-0.2067,2018-07-02 00:00:00,6,"For me, who already had some years of life behind me, the movie was almost a bit too cautious. I also recognized many aspects of other films :'Pleasantville', 'THX-1138', 'Brazil' and 'The Matrix'. It seemed to me like a lite version of' '1984' or 'Brave new world' in parts. For young people today, however, who do not yet have the background knowledge of the last generation, the film is perhaps a good introduction to ""critical thinking"". In an era where reading books seems to become increasingly unattractive, this may be a good option. But as one of the pre-reviewers wrote, I also noticed the inconsistency of the behaviour of the film characters. Many of the so-called rules have been broken far too often for the characters to be taken from their faithfulness to the rules. And what unfortunately bothered me most was the almost uninterrupted background music. As 'philosophical' entry for young people, the film is okay. For adults there is 'Blade Runner'."

This topic has been approchaed before (""Logan's Run"" is similar) and I believe it could have been developed better.Young adults can think for themselves and don't have to be soon fed morality games with obvious bias towards what is good vs. evil, moral/ethical, etc. I couldn't wait for the movie to end and then forget i ever saw it.I believe there are plenty of worthwhile stories young adults can read that can provoke discussions about social issues better than this."

But I finally had an evening to spare with it on Netflix, so I watched. Just like the book, it had me in tears pretty quickly. It held close enough to the book such that the story was recognizable, but obviously took creative license to make it more interesting on the big screen.My big, major complaint is using the love story line. Jonas was *12* in the original book, and there was no major love story. The escape story was also unnecessarily dramatic, and, frankly unrealistic for a story that is supposed to be fiction, not crazy sci-fi (Jonas did not get dropped off a waterfall, trudge through a desert, and climb and descend a mountain in knee-deep snow to leave the community and restore the memories).I was actually glad they showed the ""elimination"" of one twin, even if out of order, since that was an incredibly profound moment in the book."
" The Giver is a dystopian sci-fi that just never really gives.
",0.34,0.8563,2018-02-24 00:00:00,5,"Another adaptation of a young adult book, and yet another film filled with mediocrity. It's not terrible, it's not good...it's just fine. A ""perfect"" society living in solitude incapable of feeling emotion, until a young boy is chosen to be ""the receiver of memories"". This entails exploring humanity's past to which he then soon realises that he is living in a falsified world. It's an intriguing yet superficial premise which details the glorious aspects of the human world and the harsh reality of war, famine etc. An artificial community created to prevent bloodshed and the capability of an imperfect world. Think of it as 'Equilibrium' meets 'Twilight'. There's a dull young romance, monotonous acting and an expositional script, much like the latter film, but with an inventive premise like the former. The production design felt rather clinical, I appreciated the futuristic architecture and dystopian rituals that were included in this paradise. The generational hierarchy was a clear indication towards the acting. Streep and Bridges gave their best with the material given, Holmes and Skarsgard were second best and then we come to Thwaites and Rush who were monotonous much like the monochromatic colour scheme. The colour gradient was put to good use, slowly incorporating pigments as our main character is introduced to memories. Taylor Swift is in it for ten seconds, no idea why. Heck, I didn't even recognise her at first. The script was just bad, filled with exposition and no character development at all. The editing was far too frantic with a concoction of quick cuts. Also the ending...what even was that? Is that really a conclusion? Really? It literally makes no sense. So despite the non-sensical finale, mediocre acting and dull script...it's not all bad. Just wasted potential I guess, but I'm used to that with these young adult adaptations. Might be the first film to use both ""giver"" and ""receiver""...giggity..."
" What a load of insipid garbage!
",-0.5093,0.999,2018-01-15 00:00:00,2,"First of all, I just want to say, I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about it, without even having watched the official trailer, only the very first 1 and a half minutes of the film, which caught my attention so I decided to go ahead and watch it.
Also, this is my very first review on IMDB, I do not normally do this, but this movie is....special (not in a good way).Now that this is out of the way, let me begin:
The movie starts well, with a good premise, that looks remarkably similar to that of Equilibrium (which is an amazing film and vastly superior to this one) which precedes this movie. One can wonder (I certainly asked myself that) if The Giver simply copy pasted Equilibrium's premise, but anyway, I digress.
So far so good, I thought.
 However, the movie quickly becomes more and more nonsensical, to the point where I genuinely felt that my intelligence is downright insulted.
It kept getting worse and worse, to the point where I wanted to stop watching and start cursing at the film's screenwriters. 
How did this script got approved and went into production is just beyond me.
But what do I mean exaclty? 
Well allow me to be specific:(This is where the spoilers begin, reader beware) -Basically, the premise of the film is that in the future, in a sort of post-modern era, people have decided to create a hyper peaceful society where there is no war, conflict, cruelty, suffering, etc for everyone.
So the way to achieve this, is to make everyone not be able to feel, so that they dont get angry, sad, or in anyway malicious. With good emotions come the bad ones, so they decide to eliminate emotion altogether.
They achieve this, by injecting themselves with some substance that has this effect, and they need to take their daily dose, otherwise they will start feeling.
 As I've already said, this is pretty much a carbon copy of Equilibrium's premise,
but I was willing to let that slide. After all, not all movies need to be unique in their premise.
And this is really where the madness begins:
Apparently, along with taking away all emotions, these shots also take away color, and they make everyone see in black and white. Not colorblind, but just see in black and white, as if it were an old colorless movie. Colorblind people can still see some color.
No explanation is given for this, and we are meant to believe that this drug is able to make people see in black and white.
Fine, I can accept that, as a stretch.The giver, somehow is able to hold memories in his head, of things that he never experienced. Those memories were likely experiences of other people, now long dead, but somehow he has those memories because other givers before him, transmitted those memories to him.
That is what he is trying to do now: Transmit those memories to the protagonist, Jonas.
The way to transmit those memories to him, is through.....well magic. 
I am not kidding here. Even though there is no concept of magic in this movie's world, we are left to assume whatever we want, because no explanation is given for this transmittance of memories from one person to another.
The giver simply grabs Jonas' hands, and then Jonas sort of experiences a memory that wasnt his own. 
When he experiences that memory, Jonas also gains knowledge and starts feeling as well.
 How does he magically gain that knowledge? Well the memories are transmitted via magic, so why not knowledge such as words he has never spoken/pronounced. What the hell, if we are gonna make stuff up and offer no explanation, then WHY NOT?? Right?Now, a whole bunch of stuff happens, and I dont want to spoil the movie, but basically Jonas ends up trying to rescue a baby from execution, in order to run away with that baby. While running away, he goes through a lot of different areas.
That baby sure is superhuman, able to withstand conditions even I, a grown man probably couldnt survive in, but somehow the baby does it! By the end of the movie, that baby will have survived:1. Being carried inside a baby basket while the basket is sitting on the front of a motorcycle, doing maneuvers and being driven fast2. Motorcycle doing an insane stunt jump from like 100 meters and then landing, as if it were an expert moto cross bike, and the baby inside the basket being perfectly fine, no harm done.3. Being carried by Jonas while he walks in the desert for endless hours.4. Sleeping in the desert and Jonas feeding it milk one time (that we saw at least)5. Being dropped (again!) from a flying jet, into the water of a river which is a result of a waterfall! A grown man could die/drown from that. Not this baby!6. Being carried (again) to the top of a mountain, with extreme cold and snow everywhere. Seriously, just turn off your brain here, dont think. Its just utterly absurd.7. Being dropped onto the snow in the mountains, laying there for a while, and8. Finally being on a crazy sled ride while the sled along with Jonas carrying 
the baby descends the top of the mountain reaching pretty high speeds.And what is the explanation given for the superhuman baby??
Well, Jonas is having his memory powers transmitted to the baby, and those memory powers also make you tougher. Because thinking happy thoughts about being strong and tough makes one tough!
It makes babies survive extreme conditions, somehow their baby bodies become that of an experienced mountain climber.Sheer, utter nonsense.Also, the giver keeps repeating a whole bunch of nonsense about love, hope and of course Faith.
Faith is placed alongside the other things, as if it is something great.
He tells Jonas to question and not to believe what someone tells him just because he respects them, but then he tells him that faith is a wonderful thing.
So....being gullible and believing things without evidence, even though it goes against logic and reason, just because it just feels so damn good....is a great thing.
But I get it. In a movie where very little makes sense, where little to no explanation is given for things, we are supposed to have faith and just believe whatever feels good to us.And how is Jonas supposed to heroically save the day and make everyone feel and experience love and all that other stuff?
Well, he has to cross the border, and that border is portrayed as some magical shield of some sort (again, no explanation given).
But why does crossing that border make everyone magically feel?
Well, dont question it, its just magic!
Or, its a miracle!
Nobody knows, I'm not even sure the screenwriters know, because they didnt bother with such trivial details!Lastly, the giver knows what is out there, he wants everyone to receive the gift of feeling and be free, he knows how to do that exactly, even knows where the sled is, but damnit he has to wait for the right guy, because....well Jonas just looks cool.
No seriously, the giver could have done everything that Jonas did, even better actually, because he'd do it in secret and even prepare for the short journey so there wouldnt be any risk, especially since no one would find out because they had no reason to be suspicious of him and because they have no cameras in his house.
So....Jonas was completely useless and in fact put his friends and family at risk for no good reason.
Well done Jonas!Or should I say.....well done film producers/writers/director?The mindless drivel that is this film is just staggering.
I found myself looking for an explanation, even going back and rewatching scenes, just in case I missed something....but alas it is really that bad.
I could go on and on about the sheer irrationality and absurd nonsense that is depicted in this film, but I wont.At the end of the day, the only reason I do not give this movie a 1/10 and award it just one star above the lowest score, is because the graphics is pretty good, the sound score is above average, and the actors carry out their roles pretty well, especially Jeff Bridges.
Brendon Thwaites (Jonas) is also excellent, at least within the limitations of his role in this movie.Overall, this movie is a big disappointment, even though I had no expectations at all before watching it.
I wanted to like the movie, I really did. Towards the end, I found myself unable to keep making excuses for it, and genuinely felt that my intelligence is insulted, by this utter nonsense.If you want to just feel things and not think anything, watch this movie, it will appeal to your emotional side, but nothing more.
If you even bother to think even slightly, not only you will be disappointed, but you will often find yourself predicting nearly everything that happens, especially in the extremely predictable ending which is basically shown to the viewer about halfway through the film, so you can avoid any surprises in the film's, terribly predictable ending."

I did not have any problem understanding the ""how"" human society got there. How it was possible to consider so much of the joys we take in life as something to be sacrificed for the opportunity not to suffer the pain we have. I did not have a problem to imagine a society orderly organizing the lives of every single member of the community. Some feature of the organization attained by the movie's society are old ideas really, out of some philosopher's dreams (or out of everybody else's nightmare): Plato's Republic came to my mind, during some parts of the movie, except that the society in the movies arrives to strikingly similar results from following objectives which are way different (getting rid of pain was not Plato's objective in an ideal organization of society). I liked the acting, especially in the character of the Giver, Fiona and Jonas. I think the use of black and white was interesting. What almost managed to ruin the whole movie was the rushed ending. It could have been much better: but as it is, it just looks like the money to keep filming suddenly finished up and they had to look for a quick way to end the movie. In any case it's still a 7."

Only the desperate. The scene of this actually taking place with the father using lethal injection then disposing the baby down a trash chute is reprehensible. Oh the classroom where it was taught also had LD kids in attendance. Given recent atrocities like ""Sandy Hook"", the Church shootings in Texas, children were harmed or murdered. Year's ago I can't recall this happening for real or in print. To profit on any idea of harming newborns,this was the most vile and to use this to sensationalize a story? Is there someone ""out there"" seeing this whom would imitate, or murder, rather then seek a safe place for a newborn? I doubt teenagers (yet) have the capacity to understand this attempt at being ""Highbrow"" and should've been scrapped to begin with, and not emulate the attitude this story ...tries to convey."
" Not bad, but not that good either
",-0.2924,0.9932,2017-09-10 00:00:00,6,"I'll start by saying that I did read the book many years ago in school and thought it was a good book at the time with an interesting, unexpected twist. I never went back to re-read it so while I knew what the gist of the story was, I didn't remember all the details.As a movie, I thought it was just OK. It wasn't bad, but there were several things keeping it from being great. First, the focus was on Jonas and The Giver moreso than any of the other characters, which made it hard to sympathize with the society. The actor playing Jonas was fine, not very memorable though. I would have liked to understand the perspectives of Fiona and Asher rather than just see them the way Jonas does - in broad strokes. The release of memories from The Giver to Jonas could have been shown or explained differently as I did not really understand how that process worked. Were they sharing a psychic link? Was there a chip embedded in their wrists allowing the transfers? Also, sometimes Jonas would see things as if he were living the past memories while other times it was more like he was seeing everything play out like a movie or something. Finally, the ending was not very satisfying. I won't spoil anything but there were things that happened that did not feel realistic or believable at all. The final scene was confusing. I would say if you have nothing else to watch and are interested in a fairly PG story, this is a pretty good one. So many TV and movies are so focused on violence, sex, and darkness that it is kind of nice to have a straight forward movie that makes you think a little in the process of watching it."
" Footloose with added sci-fi mumbo-jumbo

Until the main character shows up.We have been here before, but this is a nice attempt at a retelling. The production and camera work is quite nice and the acting is pretty good. The awakening of the senses is well handled and is the high light of the film.For me though this film was doomed from the start. The dystopia is actually quite appealing. We are told that no one has emotions, yet they do - otherwise the audience wouldn't engage with the characters - they are just dialled right back. So the writers have to throw in random problems to make the world worth rebelling against. So all of a sudden people are drowning babies for no apparent reason.The writing really fails near the end. As restrictive dystopias go the inhabitants here sure get a lot of space when they go rouge.Then with a few minutes of screen time left the writers have to end this thing some how. This seems an impossible task, so they throw a smoke bomb on the floor and do a runner out the fire escape in the confusion.Has promise and some really nice sequences, but is ultimately baffling and stupid."

The importance of human emotions,how killing each other for religion, cultural differences, color will create hatred for them. To save our human civilization we have to accept the differences or perish or wipe out the differences. The film just choose the 3rd option. But without love,emotions, culture,faith,difference we may survive but not as a what truly means to be human."

Her hair was too dark to show the glaring contrast of seeing color for first time. Another complaint is the memories they used. I would have used World War II instead of Vietnam. Having the main character live through the memories of someone storming the beaches of Normandy."
" Oh god
",0.2732,-0.9909,2017-06-29 00:00:00,1,"So, I had to watch this movie because of a school project after reading the book and have to say, I was amazed at the awfulness. The effects weren't ... that bad, I have to admit. My biggest complaints are the script and the actors. The book is kinda strange but it has a few very important emotional scenes that were either skipped completely or that were delivered so badly I wanted to chuck my phone at the screen. Okay, you may say that the people in this movie are supposed to have no real emotions and that's fine! But if you deliver these 'emotional' scenes without ever showing a reaction from the one guy having emotions (Thwaites) then that's just idiotic. The movie was chaotic, sometimes we all just sat there and frowned at the screen. There were a few 'twists' in the movie that were painfully obvious even if they didn't happen in the book. The few good (experienced) actors that were in this thing were apparently determined to deliver their worst performance yet. The main characters' (Thwaites and the love-interest) acting was so painful I could barely stand to watch it. Thwaites always had this look of vague awe on his face even if it didn't fit. The love-interest's actress was one of those actresses where they are completely unremarkable. One thing however stood out. Their laughter sounded so fake it hurt!Another major problem I have with this movie is 'the Giver'. Somehow, every scene with him and Thwaites has this sexual vibe going on which is really sickening if you consider the fact Thwaites' supposed to be sixteen in this and 'the Giver's about sixty. It really creeped us all out. In conclusion (because I have to cut this short) it's awful. Don't watch it."

" Movie takes away innocence of book
",0.3818,-0.9052,2017-05-31 00:00:00,4,"My class read this book together in sixth grade. Most of the kids enjoyed it quite a bit, actually. It made us all think about how ""perfection"" isn't always perfect. After we finished the book, we were all excited because we were watching the movie together as a class. When the movie first started, I was already disappointed because all of the main characters (Jonas, Fiona, and Asher) seemed a few years older than the ""twelves"" that they are in the book.Honestly this already annoyed me because the book had a lot more innocence solely because they were still just kids. But whatever, only a 1 minor change, right? WRONG. After that, the next day in the movie is already graduation. The first few chapters were all leading up to the graduation in the book, but now in the movie it takes all of getting to know Jonas's character exposition and rushes straight to the graduation without really explaining anything. The rest of the movie was a BORE. In the movie it tries to change it into pretty much everyone hating Jonas and thinking he's some terrible person. But in the book it shows the emotion that Jonas is going through while receiving the memories, instead of focusing on some stupid hero vs. villain plot. Honestly, if I had never read the book I doubt I'd have any idea what was really going on. I don't know, this movie really should have just kept to itself. It's too thought provoking to go to Hollywood. It could've been great, but was instead mediocre."
" Getting it on with The Giver
",0.34,0.9814,2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"I will admit that there several similarities with The Giver and Divergent. Both films involve ""too good to be true"" dystopian societies, both films involve adolescent protagonists that feel they are somehow ""different"", both films have a ceremony where teenagers have their futures determined, both films even have a cold-as-ice matriarch type calling the shots. These similarities (and some others) turned people off to the Giver. That is disappointing, because the Giver, despite its wearing Divergent-style clothing, has its own strengths that make it worth seeing. At first, almost everything is shown in black, white, and various shades of gray. The only exception is when the hero, Jonas, starts to see things differently, in color. Inevitably, this is a sign that he is headed for great things â€“ he is destined to become a ""Receiver of Memory"", his mentor, the ""Giver of Memory"" will instruct his as to the way things were. Of course, the more Jonas learns the more he becomes displeased and eventually disgusted with the world around him. He learns, for example, that the practice of ""releasing"" someone means to kill, usually an infant that does not meet expected physical standards or an elderly person. Much to his horror he sees his father doing so to a baby. When he learns Gabriel, a baby his father had brought home, will be released he flees for his and Gabriel's life. Will Jonas survive? Will Gabriel survive? What will happen? The Giver may not have been a successful movie, but it is still fun. It is exciting, adventurous, there is even a wild racing scene like the Divergent ""flying off the building scene"", another similarity. If you liked Divergent, the Hunger Games, or the 1001 other dystopian future stories and movies floating around you will like The Giver."

What keeps us in the dark to a new way of living avoiding what is a part of us: feelings. As if Emotions keeps us from what is good, the colour of life. And so this story we make call it: prophetic. People change words to disguise the true meaning of what is really happening. For example: euthanasia is to kill a person to preserve his or her dignity.

" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",0.0,0.998,2017-05-20 00:00:00,10,"It was the Nebula award winning novel that took the science fiction world by storm. Almost immediately after it's release, talk of turning The Giver into a feature film began, but turning a complex science fiction story into something general audiences could enjoy was a big issue. Studio, cast delays, and re-writes held the film up for more than a decade, but in 2014 it was released and it is spectacular! In the not so distant future, on top of a mountain, lays a futurist society in which pain, war, and disease has been eliminated at a huge cost. With all that society has gained, it has lost the ability to exercise individuality and free thought, this effects everyone except for one, The Giver. The Giver is the historian, who keeps the memory of what life used to be like, so that society never forgets that what it's gained far outweighs the cost. The Giver however is old and must train a replacement. At the choosing ceremony, a young teenager named Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is chosen. Once Jonas learns the truth, he must decide to do the job of The Giver or reveal the truth, in the hopes of bringing back individuality, but at what cost? Originally producers wanted Lloyd Bridges to play the Giver, when he passed, his son took on the role, and while he doesn't fit the mold of an elder statesman, he was still amazing. Meryl Streep also partakes in this magical film, playing the settlements leader, and she is every bit as chilling and suspenseful as the character in the book. At this point, I'm really convinced that there isn't a role she can't play successfully. Even with all the star power, far an away the best performance in this film is given by Brenton Thwaites, a British actor I'd never seen before. Aside from his tremendous good looks, Thwaites portrayal of a teenager with the fate of the world on his shoulders is better than even that of Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games. The passion and charisma he portrays was absolutely infectious and helped carry the film through even the slowest parts. The Bottom Line, the book is a Sci-Fi lovers dream, while the movie is a lot different in order to attract a more mainstream audience, the power and genius of the story remains, and for that The Giver joins our list of must see movies!"

" Poorly executed.
",0.0,0.9944,2017-04-06 00:00:00,4,"If you liked this movie do not read this review because I'm going to rip it apart a bit. I think there was a lot of potential that really got missed in adapting the novel into a movie. There are some emotional themes that get explored about why everything that makes life painful also makes it beautiful. Both the book and the movie could have done a better job of having the events of the story contribute to this theme. Instead, the movie got weighed down by trying to increase the drama and stakes of the plot and trying to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games. Trying to make it appeal more to modern audiences is a perfectly fine thing to do, as was done with the Lord of the Rings movies, but in doing so the essence of the story was missed. Often when writing a script, writers say that they try to write the movie that the story wants to become, and I don't think that was done in this case.There were a few problems I had with the writing and the plot. A lot of the dialogue was not ""fly on the wall"", particularly at the beginning. The ending was too dramatic in my opinion. It is not surprising that the writers decided to make it this way, but I thought that Jonas crossing the border just in time was more than the story needed. It detracted from the simplicity of the source material and really destroyed the ambiguity of whether Jonas and the Giver releasing all their memories of the past was the right thing. By making the dystopian government more oppressive, it pushed the argument too strongly in Jonas' favor. If Jonas/the writers had really wanted us to decide whether what he did was right, they would have emphasized the perfection of the community more and made the ending more painful. Now, by that I don't mean that they should have made those changes, but I just want to highlight the hypocrisy of letting the audience ""decide"". On a final story note, there was a glaring plot hole when Jonas and Fiona kiss. The cameras and loudspeaker had previously called them out immediately for touching and the leaders were later able to watch footage of the kiss, so by the rules of the world, Jonas should have been caught right then.There was a lot of work that went into the production design and visuals. It was noticeable, because of how the picture became more colorful as time went on and Jonas learned more. The memories that the Giver gave Jonas were very vibrant so as to glorify the life that we all have now. The sets for the community and for the Giver's house also seemed to be very deliberately made. On the whole, it seems that the people who had a hand in making the movie took pride in their work, which is heartening. I just wish that the writers, actors, and director assigned to the project had employed a bit more skill. Again, I get the sense that they put in a good effort, but it just turned out a little sloppy and childish. However, I don't want to blame the writers and directors too much, because I know they aren't always responsible for the poor aspects of the movies they make.The book follows the source material decently, but takes a few liberties. Personally, I felt that the deviations from the book made the movie worse, but others might say that the changes made it more dramatic and entertaining. If you like ""teen novels"" like Divergent, you'll probably enjoy this more than the book but not as much as more modern teen books. It is a feel-good movie, and hardly lives up to its PG-13 rating in terms of subject matter and intensity. On the whole, I did not like it, but that does not mean that you won't. Overall Rating: 4.7/10"
" Don't Judge It Because It Wasn't The First
",0.0,0.9899,2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Many years ago, I remember reading ""The Giver"" as a child and being enthralled by it. I didn't really understand it at the time, but I knew even then that it was something special. When I stepped into the theater for this film adaptation of Lois Lowry's now-classic, I was nervous that it wouldn't produce that same type of feeling. I had heard many bad reviews and was a bit worried at the short runtime. What I quickly discovered, however, is that watching ""The Giver"" on the big screen was just as captivating as the novel experience.For a basic plot summary, ""The Giver"" tells the story of teenaged Jonas (Brenton Thwaites), who lives in a dystopian/utopian (you be the judge) society in the distant (but maybe not TOO distant) future. All emotion has been drained out of life and things are very procedural. Babies are assigned to families, rules govern practically every action, there is no crime, and no colors exist. While nearing the end of his formal schooling, Jonas (and his fellow classmates) are assigned functions in everyday society. While most of his friends are assigned to normal tasks associated with everyday life, Jonas is designated the ""receiver of memory"" and must meet with The Giver (Jeff Bridges), who shows him visions of the past and explains the reasoning behind why the current society is how it is. To say any more would tread into spoiler territory.For some reason, I think that this movie may be judged a bit harshly because of all that has come before it. Recently, theaters have been filled with movies such as ""Hunger Games"", ""Divergent"", and ""The Book Thief"" (to name a few) that are based on popular YA novels. Maybe people are starting to get weary of that genre just a bit. However, one must remember that without Lowry's Giver, you could make a case that those other titles would be figments of our imagination and nothing more. So please, don't judge it because for whatever reason it was ""late to the party"".Personally, I think that ""The Giver"" tells an even better story than any of those aforementioned titles. It is filled with great imagery, emotional story lines, and characters that really seem to be alive and are people that you want to care about. Part of the reason is that it isn't just a ""young adult"" story. It can very much appeal to adults and director Phillip Noyce makes sure that his adaptation stays true to that. There aren't sappy love triangles or teenage angst in this one.Overall, this was a treat to see. I have long held the text version in high regard, and I am encouraging anyone who has read that novel to treat themselves to this visual version. Even the controversial scenes are done in such a tactful, thoughtful way that it never seems pandering or ""preachy""."
" Doesn't Follow Story

The characters don't have much spirit, they seem more dead.But, the ending is charming. This is why I give it a 6."
" The Giver
",0.34,0.958,2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"The story was set in a utopian where there is no grief, no fear, no pain, no loneliness and no difference. Nevertheless, the community is also without memory, emotion, colors and music. Young Jonas was chosen to be ""the giver"". After he learnt all kinds of things absent in the community and knew the past, he understood happiness and love. The naked true of the so-called ""perfect world"" was revealed. Jonas doubted the superficial harmony of his world and decided to make a change. The polysemy of the gist is what I appreciate most of the movie. As far as I am concerned, the story can be analyzed philosophically. Is absolute consistence necessary? What do us humans need to attain ""perfect society""? After watching the film and reading the original novel by Lois Lowry, I learnt more about the significance about emotions, especially love. In the film, the previous giver played by Jeff Bridges left me with the long-lasting memory due to his line â€“ ""Just like music, there's something else you can't see with your eyes. Something that lives deep inside you. Something those morning injections take awayÂ…they remove somethingÂ… EmotionsÂ… Feelings are just fleeting, on the surface. But emotions, they're very deep, primal. They linger."" To be objective like movie reviewers, there are some bugs about the settings. But as a normal, nonprofessional movie lover, I was emotionally attached and assimilated by this motion picture."

Here they areÂ : 3EÂ : This film seems interesting. We think the trailer is well made. It looks really dynamic and futuristic. The music was not original but of excellent quality. The characters are good and they seem to play well. They are beautiful, young and well dressed. There are many amazing special effects. It is interesting and very realistic. We really enjoyed itÂ ! The set is beautiful and varied but on the other hand, the costumes look a little too simple. The set is futuristic and greatÂ ! 3C: The music of the trailer is gripping and stressful: it helps building the suspense. The set and costumes are exactly what we can imagine in this type of film, so they aren't very original but they stick to the plot. The trailer of""The Giver"" doesn't reflect the story, the plot is amazing but at the beginning, it was in black and white and it surprised us. Then, we understand why it wasn't in colours. The plot is amazing and the action scenes are gripping. There are many special effects so we can see flying saucers, futuristic bikes...One group in the class thinks isn't really fun because it seems like a teen-movie full of clichÃ©s and the end is quite predictable. But overall, the trailer makes us want to see the film because it is science-fiction!3B: The special effects were the most stunning element of the trailer. For example, the futuristic city or the holograms were pretty good. It was mind-blowing. We think it is a great teen-movie, action-packed and full of suspense. It is a science-fiction film that we would like to see because it looks entertaining and fun. The trailer creates suspense. The music was a good choice because it fits perfectly the trailer and it is gripping. The main cast is well chosen because they are young and they play well even if the characters are not really expressive. Another group in the class thinks that this seems to be a classic teen-movie: the plot looks entertaining but quite predictable. There's a lot of action. The costumes are also futuristic. The characters have town and work uniforms, very realistic and beautiful. It is nice to watch!"
" Great in pictures - poor in story
",0.25,0.9562,2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"1. How close it is to the book. a) message I have just read the book and loved the idea that it's inspiring you to think about society. You are animated in the book to think about its goals and values. You aren't given the answer as you may come to either solution. The movie is giving you an opinion and doesn't get tired to tell it to you at several points of it but also at the whole conclusion of the movie. The settlement was somewhere on a mountain or sky instead on the ground.b) story progress The story is different by including a love story, violence and other things2. The movie as such I enjoyed the idea to have everything set in black and white unless it is a scene with people who can see everything. I enjoyed the imagination used in the setting and Jeff Bridges does everything to look brilliant.However, Meryl Streep just seemed lost. Her character has clearly a concept for emotions, lies and betrayal but she is only showing it in her acting by times. The ending doesn't make sense at all. I don't want to provide spoilers to explain it further. 3. Conclusion If you want to see a beautiful movie with interesting backstory you will enjoy the most of the movie. However, the last 30 minutes aren't really worth your time as the poor acting and script from that time on couldn't convince me to see a sequel if ever made by the same author."
" engaging
",0.34,-0.899,2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Jeff Bridges plays an atypical role for him -- a mysterious, wise old man. Meryl Streep plays the chief bureaucrat, well intentioned, but icy. Brenton Thwaites plays Jonas a perfectly handsome young man, genetically designed for perfection, somewhat bland who is charged with being the repository of banned memories for the community.This movie takes place in the future after some ruinous global war. The powers that be have decided they must chemically suppress most emotion, and keep from everyone any memory of violence, starvation or evil, love, music or emotion. There is no believable explanation for suppressing the positive.Only two people are permitted to remember the past or to feel positive and negative emotion. They do not submit themselves to physical torture.It is a very regimented authoritarian society. People are assigned their careers. Babies are assigned to families for care. The death penalty is used for the slightest transgression. It is administered painlessly and compassionately.In parts of the movie, my corn-o-meter went off the scale. For example when crowds would chant ""Jonas"" for no apparent reason. There would often be wordless montages to show joy or evil with trite images.Jonas seemed highly attached to his adopted baby brother, but spends no time with him. That did not ring true for me.Most of the movie is fairly realistic with a dose of woo. Thoughts can pass from person to person by touching arms. The entire mentality of a city changed from some magic ray triggered because a boy went on a sleigh ride past a tower. This is goofier than a comic book plot.The movie is done like the Wizard of Oz, mostly in black and white but with touches of colour to suggest emotion."
