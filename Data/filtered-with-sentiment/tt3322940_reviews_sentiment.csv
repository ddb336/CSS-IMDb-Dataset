",0.0,-0.7846,2021-03-23 00:00:00,6,"A not too bad way to fill a couple of hours - not bad but not that great either. Some scary moments, but frankly it's all been done before. Better.I do wish they'd use a replica of the real Annabelle doll though, which is much cuter and would make the horror far more interesting. This doll is just too obviously evil looking.A couple of issues I had with this film is the police officer saying ""If I hear anything else I'll reach out to you"", and pastel colours and laminate flooring in every indoor scene.The film is set in 1970; who was historical advisor on this film, Justin Bieber?"
" Yes, this IS quite scary!
",-0.2698,-0.9455,2021-03-08 00:00:00,6,"At the time, 'Annabelle' was marketed as ""one of the scariest movies ever made"". I've seen my share of scary movies and I have to agree this was pretty darn scary.Mother hen and goose, the jump scares are effective! 'Annabelle' is creepy as hell. Remember Annabelle - the crippled girl from 'Annabelle: Creation'? Well, she's back as Annabelle Higgins - named after the family who adopted her at the end of the aforementioned film. She's in the movie for just a little while - as a crazed woman who is a member of a cult - but plays a big part in the movie.'Annabelle' never really gets completely out of control like some films of this genre. The haunting is for most part very subtle, but there are some seriously scary and disturbing demonic images that will give you gooseflesh. Do not let young children watch this! Adhere to the age restriction, because this is guaranteed to give them nightmares. Even some adults might not be able to watch this creepy tale of possession.The acting was very good; especially Annabelle Wallis as Mia (Yup, the lead actress is actually called Annabelle!!). I believed her desperation, fear and concern every step of the way. The doll itself didn't really play a big part in this movie. There were moments when I felt they included scenes of the doll simply because the film is named after the doll, but in fact there really was no need for the doll at all. The demonic presence would have sufficed, and was a lot scarier since the doll was actually passive. Nevertheless, 'Annabelle' is a great addition to the 'Conjuring' universe."

" Annabelle (2014, John R. Leonetti) Demonic doll spun out from 'The Conjuring' has lackluster start
",0.0,0.9508,2021-02-11 00:00:00,5,"Annabelle (2014, John R. Leonetti)
As major franchises build massive extended universes to mixed success attempting to copy the Marvel mold that template is also being put to functional use at the mid-tier level as well. 'Annabelle' is the second movie in the mid-budget Conjuring universe. This film expands on the story first touched upon in 'The Conjuring' about the mysterious possessed doll we see securely locked in the Warren's Connecticut home in the 2013 film. For some unknown reason this film doesn't tackle the topic of how the doll came to end up in a glass case in a Connecticut home cum museum, but instead picks up the story in 1967 as a young, promising doctor purchases the doll for his wife who has a collection. Soon after mysterious things start happening such as a grisly murder next door. The young couple flees to L.A. in an attempt to start from scratch but with the demonic doll in tow things continue to spiral downward. The plot becomes pretty generic possession type fare at this point. About the only interesting thing in the whole story is the fact that the lead character is played by a woman named Annabelle. That's a mildly creep coincidence, right? Beyond that this movie is okay but in the realm of thrillers and horror you need to do much more than this pedestrian story to really make something good and memorable rather than what this film is which is bland and forgettable. While this film is entirely fictional many know that Annabelle is based on a real doll, however, that doll looks nothing like the doll in the movies, but for those who know what they are looking for you can see the original type of doll in the end scene as the camera pans around a secondhand store where Annabelle lies in wait to find more unsuspecting folks to torment. That was a nice little Easter egg. Beyond that there was nothing in this film that lives up to 'The Conjuring' lineage and this is just a basic throw away film and pretty much the definition of average.

" I like your dolls
",0.3612,-0.8426,2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Annabelle is a compelling horror film that has a well paced story and is effective and honest with it's suspense and jump scares that will keep you on edge and hooked until the very end.When I found out that the Annabelle story was loosely based off true events it made the film even more appealing to me.One of the early sequences involve members of a satanic cult who break in and attack John and Mia in their Santa Monica home immediately after slaughtering their next door neighbours in cold blood and it was filmed with such potency that it felt so oddly realistic. It immediately grabs your attention and from this point on you feel heavily immersed in the story.The demon in Annabelle was intimidating and fascinating. A dark entity with gargoyle facial features and ram horns curving around it's head. I absolutely loved the scene about halfway through the film with the storage lockers and it's here where we get our first real glimpse of the demon.An absolutely terrified Mia after coming into physical contact with the entity rushes to the elevator only to realise that while the doors shut it just won't go up to her level and every time the doors open again she is still on the same floor. Each time the doors reopen you expect to see the demon coming towards her or that it will suddenly appear in the darkness. Finally Mia is forced to get out of the elevator and make a run for the stairwell. The camera angles are hiding both our and Mia's peripheral vision in this scene and so it does a tremendous job of keeping your mind guessing.The sequence looks dark and frightening and you feel trapped and fearful for Mia, and can't help but put yourself in her shoes and realise how vulnerable she is in this situation and that there is almost nothing else she can do.It was thrilling to see Annabelle doll jerk from the floor and then suddenly come to life only for us to see past the deception and to the demon holding Annabelle up from behind like a puppet. The scene shows that the demon has attached itself to the doll like a conduit which makes you feel such a force of power from the entity's presence.Only a couple of negatives for me was the more times you see the demon the more you are desensitised to it which takes away it's frightening appeal. Secondly as the plot goes on it starts becoming a little predictable. There is not much that completely stuns you, and the ending doesn't really thrill you as something you are likely to remember after the film ends.This is a reasonable scary story that is unique in its own way. I got more than I expected with Annabelle and the cinematography was amazing. I'm also a big fan of James Wan's work and what he does with his films so if I see his name in any production then I won't hesitate to put that film on my watch list.7/10"

I honestly didnt really see much problem with this film. It was creepy and creative with its scares. It was a solid film overallPros:Creative Scares - To be honest, one of the things I love about supernatural horror movies is when they get creative with its scares. Such as the scene where the mother was in one room staring at a little girl in the room in front of her. She began running towards the room as the door closed. Once the door closed her out of frame fully, she burst through the door as a grown women. So really, creative scarsAtmosphere - I was on edge because I didn't really know what was going to happen. The mother wasnt safe where she went. Even out in public where she saw a women holding her baby. So the atmosphere was chillingCons -Mother's Decisions - I'm not sure but I feel like the mother has made some dumb decisions in the film. I felt like she did but that's probably just meThe priest is hurt...how? -
I'm dead honest the priest went up to the church, the doors open and he was literally pushed backwards. And For some reason it ended him up in the hospital. Literally he was pushed backwards onto the ground XD
Like what?And the ending of Annabelle Creation left me confused for this movie beginning. She successfully got the soul but in this film, she targets the baby/mother soul. I was confused on why she neded another soul. Maybe she wants to stay young so she transitions between souls?Overall
I didnt really think this film was terrible

There was such huge potential for this movie to be scary. Extremely creepy looking doll, backstory from The Conjuring , an old house and a baby. But instead of a genuinely haunting movie, we were subjected to an insulting plot with ZERO scares. I am not exaggerating. There were zero scary parts in this. Lots of zooming in on the creepy doll's face. You expect something to happen at this point. The head to move, the mouth to open, the eyes to blink. But no, there was nothing. Just a slow zooming in shot of a stationary inanimate doll.Look at the movie's budget vs. profit and you'll see why the producers wanted to make this movie. It was simply a cash making exercise with no thought given to the plot.This should not be classed as a horror movie. I've seen Scooby Doo cartoons which were scarier than this."

Because that's these horror movies summed up. I was endlessly confused becy it's supposed to be the doll that's possessed and the doll never does anything.the demon possessing it seems to do stuff completely on its own without a body so what's the point of the doll? Or does the demon just need a safe space to come back to when it's done all its shenanigans? XD. This isn't interesting or scary at all. It's just random spirits appearing, she moves ONCE,pops some popcorn and learns to sew in the middle of the night. They definitely should have made the doll a Raggedy Ann or if they couldn't get the rights to that something very similar. Half of the reason Chucky was scary was because he looked sweet and innocent and then when the spirit moved the doll he got super evil looking! if the doll already looks like a demon possessed creepy weirdo then it takes the surprise scare factor out of it.."
" This Is Somehow Worse Than La Llorona (2019)
",-0.4767,-0.9942,2020-10-14 00:00:00,1,"Pros:
1. The wide shots create good tension as it gives the viewer a lot to focus on thus keeping you on your toes.
2. The sound-mixing is decent and it does its best to induce suspense and horror.Cons:
1. The score is overbearing and it tries to force tension but it ends up being highly annoying.
2. The Demonic Figure's (Joseph Bishara) existence adds nothing to the story and is nonsensical.
3. The jump-scares are poorly placed and executed.
4. Mia (Annabelle Wallis) decides to get rid of the Annabelle doll at the old house because of the cult murder it was linked to, but then she randomly retracts her ill-feelings towards the doll in the new house with little to no explanation.
5. The plot is highly repetitive as nothing of any worth happens and is inundated with cheap lazy scares.
6. The character of John (Ward Horton) is barely fleshed out and he could have been killed off early into the film as he does virtually nothing. And the character of Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) is clearly just inserted to pseudo-intellectually waffle on about spirits, and to make sure none of the main characters die.
7. The editing is over-the-top at times with the lighting flashing in a haywire manner, or with slow-motion needlessly thrown in.
8. The dialogue is often clunky, especially when it tries to desperately sound ominous and scary.
9. Annabelle Wallis' performance ranges from distractingly underwhelming, to obnoxiously overwhelming."

" Very weak.
",-0.4927,-0.8423,2020-08-08 00:00:00,2,"Horror films are usually a box of surprises because it is not easy to know if they are going to be excellent or a total crap. I didn't have many expectations for ""Conjuring"" and I was pleasantly surprised. In this case, and knowing that this film came more or less following that one, I expected something with some quality, at least... but that's not what I found.This film is a horror story created around a vintage doll that is supposedly inhabited by a demon. The film even starts well and promises a lot, but gets lost along the way. I don't know what was worse... the script was weak, with a boring and illogical story, the scares are predictable (we foreseen it ten seconds in advance, no exaggeration). But perhaps the worst of all is the absence of any tension or suspense, that sense of danger or threat that makes even the stupidest horror movie basically work. The film never manages to build that and I just watched it with the emotion and interest of those who go to the grocery store to buy some fruits.The cast is weak. Ward Horton and Annabelle Wallis are the only actors with material to show some talent. Despite that, I cannot say that I saw a dramatic show. The material given to the actors is bad and none of the character has been well developed or stands out. The film was directed by John R. Leonetti, who is good at cinematography and should stick to it (the few films he has directed, including this one, do not inspire me to try again or recommend it as director). He was responsible for the cinematography of ""Conjuring"" and, as a result, these two films have a very similar look, which indicates that he left his stamp on the visual style and camera work here.Indeed, cinematography is very good, perhaps one of the strengths here. With an excellent balance of light and shadow, it knows how to give this film an elegant and, sometimes, sinister visual beauty that, unfortunately, the script does not follow and ends up without any practical use. The sets and costumes, very much like the 60s, also look great on the screen. The soundtrack is good, but not surprising."

" Needed the Warrens
",0.0,0.9845,2020-06-27 00:00:00,5,"Being a follow-up to The Conjuring (and featuring another case allegedly investigated by supernatural investigative duo Ed and Lorraine Warren), the fictitious versions of themselves are sorely lacking in this film.
It doesn't feel like a follow-up to The Conjuring. It begins with a scene that's briefly included in The Conjuring and it ends with a brief reference to Ed and Lorraine Warren, but other than that it feels disjointed, something that wants to fit in but will never truly belong in The Conjuring universe no matter how hard it wants to.Annabelle is a slow-burning story about a mother's love, essentially. It's surrounded by a cliched ghost story that, while visually impressive and with scares and tension that is successfully executed, doesn't live up to its predecessor. The acting was fine, and the story was entertaining in the moment but it's nothing particularly memorable.This is a film that was a lot of fun in the theatre but now, with the ever-expanding Conjuring universe in perspective, it's really the outlier in the group. Not a bad movie by any means but, considering it's marketed as being part of a bigger universe that fits together perfectly without this entry, it so evidently doesn't belong. It feels as though Warner Bros. wanted to profit off The Conjuring by pumping out a sequel as quickly as possible, so quickly that they couldn't get the actors for Ed and Lorraine on board so they wrote them completely out of the film, which is really the biggest downfall it has. Had a little more time and effort been put into the writing of the script, alongside a little continuity with The Conjuring and the films that would follow, this could've been a much better entry."

",0.0,0.7932,2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,"This film introduces Annabelle, the evil possessed doll that was locked away by the Warrens in The Conjuring.We meet John and Mia who are expecting their first child. John pulls out the porcelain Annabelle doll as a gift for the new baby on the way. After a home invasion by a deranged man and woman causes the death of their neighbours and attack John and Mia, they move out of their suburban home and in a luxury apartment in Pasadena. The movie makes sure we notice that the blood of the dead home invader goes into the doll when she kills herself.Once at the new apartment, we see the regular day to day life of John and Mia with their newborn Leah. John goes to work to work each day while Mia stays at home and watches classic soap opera General Hospital. Very 60's housewife vibes which makes sense since that is the era this film is set in. Not before long, Mia starts seeing shadows at the new place, electronics start turning on and off without her touching them, and the woman who tried to kill her appears to her more than once. All seems to be connected to the Annabelle doll and the two deranged people who were a part of a satanic cult that invaded their home at the beginning of the film.Annabelle is a wonderful horror film. It doesn't rely on gore and CGI effects and let's the small things matter most. We get demons standing in plain sight which viewers have to catch out of the corner of the shot. And once you see the images it has major impact. There are some really good chase scenes between the demon and Mia throughout the apartment complex which were very well done. We don't see much of the doll moving around like Chucky would, and I'm really grateful for that. Less is more, and the things we don't see are sometimes scarier than the obvious in films like this.I really enjoyed Annabelle Willis' performance as Mia. She gave me some serious Dianna Agron vibes ala Glee and character Quinn Fabray. Willis had great chemistry with on-screen husband John played by Ward Horton who did an equally good job in this movie. Alfre Woodard was a nice addition to the cast as well with her supportive role of Evelyn, the neighbour who takes a liking to Mia.All in all, Annabelle is a pretty scary horror film that did very well at the box office for good reason.

",0.2382,-0.8698,2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"The edits and the film techniques are almost as frightening as what is actually happening. They also serve to move things along, which is important as, so far in movies, there is no such thing as an no-warning blitz entity attack, unless it's the opening scene before the movie title pops up. I recently saw a movie called Dead Silence, also about a dangerous doll. Here's the thing. You can't compare Annabelle with that movie, it's a different tack altogether. Annabelle is not that different from many recent urban myth teen movies, particularly the SlenderMan/ Bye Bye Man/Midnight Man, or movies like Hannah Grace, Grave Halloween, Truth or Dare, La Llorona or The Vatican Tapes. I offer up these examples so people can know that this movie has far more in common with these than with the classic Dead Silence. Thing is, Annabelle is not a teen movie. It belongs in the Conjuring universe, which is, as I understand it, connected by two (very real) paranormal investigators. They don't make an appearance here, but this is about adults. Annabelle is set in the 1970s, but as it needs to be about creepy things indoors you probably won't notice. It's as accomplished a production as one would expect from the reliable Warner Bros. The initial attack by cult members is easily the most classic horror sequence in the show, but there are plenty of other great images, but, unlike Dead Silence, usually not involving the actual doll. It lost points from me because of believability. Early on it was established the mother was a freeze rather than flight or fight kinda girl, but, for me, this wasn't enough to explain her later hesitations to rush to put out fires, so to speak, particularly when it involved her infant. In any case, perhaps the movie was trying to imply mothers of the 1970s didn't watch their toddlers every second. I doubt that, but even so, after several entity manifestations one rather thinks that watching toddlers every single second would definitely be the rule. It makes for a great fright night, sure, but, again, for me, the movie thus just falls short of being the greatest fright night ever."

Not being a big fan of horror movies i wasn't too excited about it. I love movies like The Thing and the original Fright NIght but i knew Annabelle would be garbage, i mean just look at it.A guy buys his doll collecting wife a doll which looks like a creepy horror movie doll and she never comments on how gross it looks, she's delighted like ""Oh my god thanks i love you!"" it's so ridiculous and unintentionally funny. Soon after that scary things start happening to them.
The wife is a typical dumb horror movie character and much of the movie consists of scenes of her alone in the house hearing a noise and then going to check it out only to be frightened by a jump scare (The lights in the house don't work because of course they don't). This happens multiple times throughout the movie. There is one legit creepy scene involving a demon in a dark room but other than that it's pretty pointless and bad.This is typical B horror trash which is cheap to make but for whatever reason people flock to see it in the cinema so it makes a ton of money.
Because this was cheap to make and it made money there's now sequels.

While that isn't in any way a bad idea, what ends up hurting the movie is the undercooked, boring and somewhat uneventful direction in which it decides to take the story it makes for itself. At the end of it all however, a horror movie is mainly judged by just how scary it is and in the case of ""Annabelle"", with only the exception of a handful of moments, staring at the poster for a while will most likely be more unsettling and frightening that sitting through the actual movie."

Yeah that's right - the husband brings evil into his loving family home and the wife places the doll, front and centre in their child's nursery.....why?Sadly, it has too many jump scares in this movie.

This film is very boring, dull and uninteresting. The beginning is ehh. Once things go crazy in the beginning it was pretty thrilling but after that it's just a huge mixed bag with overall bad qualities, literally so many of the horror this film tries so hard to rely on is closeup shots of Annabelle with the music then it cuts. It's annoying and overtime it gets tiring and very repetitive. This film has one of the most dumbest third acts I've seen in a horror movie. Third acts can make or break the film.

" Annabelle
",0.0,-0.9963,2019-05-27 00:00:00,6,"As a prequel and spin-off of The Conjuring - 2013's highly effective horror film - Annabelle does what it promises, even if it does so one jump and one jolt at a time. But that's all you get, jumpy scenes done to perfection, with little or no atmosphere and a story that disintegrates before it reaches a satisfying conclusion.One of the most important aspects of The Conjuring and older sibling Insidious (both films directed by James Wan), is the cinematography and how it wreaks havoc with the viewer's peripheral vision. By this I am referring to events occurring off-center, or in some corner of the screen that is oblivious to on-screen characters but very obvious to the viewer. Consider a scene where a mother watches over her new born baby. The scene is shot in the living room where the right half of the frame is composed of the mother and her baby and the left half is a hallway that leads to other rooms in the house. Without shifting focus from the mother and child, we see something or someone lurking in the hallway behind; something that shouldn't be there in the first place. While this tactic is nothing new to horror-thrillers, it works for the whole purpose of inducing dread, thick and slow, before the actual jolt hits a few seconds later. The scariest scenes in Annabelle are made up of these moments, and at times we are left guessing what lurks in the corners. And is probably why cinematographer John R Leonetti of those preceding films is tasked with directorial duties in this film, while Wan himself is bumped up to producer. Leonetti plays it safe by treading down Wan's beaten path but without any surprises of his own.Playing the aforementioned mother is Annabelle Wallis (freaky coincidence?) as Mia Gordon. Mia has a doll collection, one of which is the titular vintage doll gifted by her medical student husband John (Ward Horton). After surviving a horrific attack from a satanic cult, the Gordons have new guests that won't leave. At first Mia starts seeing things and becomes increasingly paralysed by fear while John begins to doubt her sanity. It's a stock approach to crying wolf in horror movies. It takes a while to dawn on them that something has latched on to Annabelle, making the doll a conduit with increasing intent on harming them and their new born baby. Consultations with a librarian and a priest reveal far greater implications, thus leaving these young parents to ward off hell by going right through it.On one hand, the look and feel in this film is a copy-paste version of Insidious, but concentrated with sporadic moments of numbing fright. We've seen it before in classic horror films - young parents who must literally go through hell to save their child's soul. It's the same concept here but effective enough for a low budget horror film. Like a stern disciple, Leonetti is on par with Wan's technical approach. Cinematography, hair raising sound design (including deliberate moments without sound), and some decent tension will garner a few screams from the audience, but that's about it. On the downside, there isn't much of a story for a script based on real events and don't even expect anything along the lines of an animated '√áhucky' doll. It's not about what the doll can do but about what's in the doll -If only they had built on that frame of thought. After some well-timed jump scares in the first half, all we are left with is a murky conclusion owing to underwritten supporting cast members whose inclusion leaves the ending stale and cheap."

The production quality, as is the case with the whole franchise, is great. Annabelle isn't a poorly made film, it's downfall comes from the slow plot. That being said though, I understand what the writers were trying to do, they are trying to root this film in reality. The climatic 'scare' moment when Annabelle levitates isn't scary on screen, but if you take a step back and think about what it would be like in real life, it would be terrifying.
Unfortunately, that's not enough to elevate this film to the level of others in the franchise, but it's certainly not as bad as I was lead to believe."

",-0.34,-0.9847,2019-04-23 00:00:00,4,"A welcomed spin-off to 'The Conjuring', considering its sub-plot involving the titular wretched doll certainly terrified many, if only it was handed to a more experienced director. Leonetti, who helmed such masterpieces like 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' and 'The Butterfly Effect 2', falls trap to the many pitfalls that plague low-budget horrors. Gone are the stylish suspense driven camera techniques that Wan confidently possessed, now replaced by lacklustre direction with two featureless leads and a second-rate script. No wonder Annabelle looks worse for wear, bless her! A husband grants his wife a collectible doll, which is soon possessed by a demonic presence summoned by devil worshippers who raid their home and attempt to attack them.A few terrifying scares that prove to be somewhat effective, notably the storage floor sequence and the introductory home invasion scene, which illicit one or two satisfactory jump scares. A demon's face barging its way to the front of the camera did nearly force me to change my underwear. Yet despite the promising horror aspects, no matter how infrequent they were, the story with its repetitious slow pacing and mundane dialogue was enough to make anyone fall asleep cuddling the titular doll tightly dreaming the words ""please just end it, end it now"". Wallis was insufferably boring with her constant whining and screaming, succumbing to the outdated ""distressed damsel"" trope, that I can only assume she was hired just for her forename. Horton was just as bad, portraying the most useless husband possible. But it's fine, because he just kept smiling.The plot itself lacked any mystery or suspense, mostly due to the way it was structured. It revealed all the details within the first act! Only to then conclude with an impeccably dumb soul trade thing that really made no sense, but by then I didn't care. The quality rapidly degraded as the runtime continued on, almost resembling a cheap dollhouse for Annabelle to reside in. To date, it is the worst ""Conjuring Universe"" film."

Here are the negatives. This has to be some of the worst editing I have ever seen. It does rapid cuts which make no sense story wise and makes some scenes linger way too long. The rest of the cast's acting ranges from mediocre to terrible. The father actor is either not trying or trying too hard. The character Evelyn is established halfway through the movie but she has no character and you can't get behind her. When she sacrifices herself at the end of the film, you don't feel for her because she has no character. The tone is really inconsistent and the cinematography is bland and boring. The camera work is also terrible. The type of camera they use changes every couple of scenes and it looks terrible. Overall, the plot does not work.

That film was so successful and critically acclaimed that you honestly cannot blame the producers for wanting to squeeze the formula like a lemon and exploit every possible side story or creep-factor that can be exploited. As far as I remember, the porcelain doll Annabelle was simply a piece of eerie scenery in the original, but barely one year later it thus received its very own and hyped full-length feature film. It's certainly not a bad idea, but they overlooked one small but important little detail: ""The Conjuring"" was directed by James Wan, and he just happens to be one of the most gifted young directors of the new millennium. Wan has an incredible eye for sinister atmosphere, and all his horror films (""Saw"", ""Dead Silence"", ""Insidious"", ""The Conjuring"") are intense & horrifying. John R. Leonetti, on the other hand, is a decent cinematographer but a very mediocre director. Under his leadership, ""Annabelle"" is hardly more than a standard ghost-movie with predictable jump-moments and lukewarm scares. In 1970, in California, John and Mia live in a peaceful church community and are anxiously awaiting the birth of their first child. The loving husband he is, John managed to purchase a large porcelain doll for Mia's collection, and it promptly receives an honoree place in the baby room. Shortly after, members of a deranged satanic cult invade their home and one of them is shot dead by the police whilst holding the Annabelle doll in her arms. I reckon you can easily guess what happens next, right? Although linked to ""The Conjuring"", ""Annabelle"" feels more reminiscent to the original ""Child's Play"" and one of the numerous movies about the crimes committed by the followers of Charles Manson. In ""Child's Play', prior to dying, serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) transfers his soul into a toy doll via occult spells, but here this seemingly happens automatically with the porcelain doll. The crazed Satanists are more than obviously modeled after the Manson Family members that murdered actress Sharon Tate and her friends. There are a handful of noteworthy sequences, but Leonetti focuses too much on the spooky doll's face rather than on plot development. Even the best sequences are derivative, like the little girls foreboding drawings, and the climax is extremely unsatisfying. Who is this Evelyn woman, anyways?"
" Dirty Doll
",-0.4404,0.9105,2019-01-20 00:00:00,5,"I watched Annabelle: Creation first so I saw the part at the end of that movie that is shown in the first part of this film. I didn't get it when I watched Annabelle: Creation but now I do.This wasn't too bad. There were some genuinely creepy parts. Annabelle Wallis is beautiful but she's kind of a dud and she's boring. The lead guy looked more like a high schooler than a father and husband. AW looked like his older sister. He was kind of ""howdy doodyish"". They had no chemistry. He lacks something - his looks and his acting just don't seem big screen appropriate. That baby was so dang cute.A few questions, observations and thoughts...Why would she put the doll up on the shelf in the new apartment in the baby's room after making such a big deal about not wanting anything to do with it earlier.The doll is so dirty and tore up and it's face is creepy yet the lady at the end is just gonna buy it with no hesitation?! Who wants a crappy looking doll even if it is rare?!Who were those little kids on the steps
that drew the creepy pictures? Were they possessed when they did that? Were they even real or were they ghosts? They were being super secretive so I'm still trying to figure that out.A cop wouldn't just let a rando look at a case file and keep photos like that.Finally I don't think it's very respectful to make movies that reference the Manson murders or use them as a type of model for behavior if they aren't documentaries or movies that are based on those events. If handled respectfully and with the goal in mind to bring to life the victims then that's admirable. If the film is meant to humanize these people and show how truly awful Charles Manson and his followers were so that maybe it could be used as a cautionary tale I get it BUT in the case of this particular film it wasn't. Mostly teens watch these horror films so they aren't as familiar with the Manson murders as those of past generations. Those were real people with family members & friends -many of whom are still alive today. I just think it's in bad taste to use something like that as fodder for a dumb horror flick. It's insensitive and these writers and directors need to be more respectful when coming up with ideas. They could've made this movie referencing a random cult not specifically Charles Manson and it could have been just as effective. It's kind of shameful that the writer and director couldn't come up with any other ideas for a fictional film so they resort to using Manson...on a film like this-these types of movies that have no substance and are churned out on a regular basis. They are generally conceived strictly as cash grabs for entertaining teens who want films with jump scares and demonic overtones. There is plenty of other material to mine from to write a story."
" Annabelle ranks as one of the most entertaining Hollywood horror outings of the year.
",-0.1952,-0.8658,2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,"With Halloween almost upon us, this is traditionally a time when low-budget horror movies loom ever larger in the cinemas. One of the biggest hits of last year, in terms of return for budget, was The Conjuring and Annabelle acts as effectively a prequel to and spin-off from that movie.Again based on the case files of real-life 'supernatural detectives' Ed and Lorraine Warren, Annabelle is in essence an 'evil doll' movie which explains how said titular doll wound up in a sealed cabinet in the Warrens' museum where, the credits inform us, it's blessed twice a month by a priest just to be on the safe side. Right so.Anyway, we're back in 1969 and the Manson family are on the prowl, as are various Satanic cults, one of which, Disciples of the Ram, murders John and Mia Gordon's (Ward Horton and Annabelle Wallis) neighbours and attacks them.Just as the police arrive, one of the cult kills herself and her blood drains into the eye of the doll which, it has to be said, is one of the scariest yokes you'll ever see.Subsequently the heavily pregnant Mia begins to have visions that some presence or other is after her baby and seeks the help of a local priest (Tony Amendola) and a woman who runs an occult bookshopAnnabelle works reasonably well in the first half, building up a nice sense of impending dread. It borrows heavily fromRosemary's Baby before turning to a by-the-numbers litany of standard shock tactics."

The local priest helps them out with advice as it seems demons inside of dolls is common place.Electrical devices turn on by themselves...ooh scary and Mia runs around frantically in the dark for about half the film. They could have easily cut about 30 minutes out of the middle and no one would notice.The production could have shown us some cult activity. Maybe see the doll do something horrific. Nope.

" The not-terrifying-enough supernatural
",0.0,-0.8892,2018-10-15 00:00:00,4,"Have an appreciation for horror and there are a fair share of good to classic ones in the genre as well as a fair share of not so good and even downright bad ones. Really liked both 'The Conjuring' films so watched 'Annabelle', which has garnered a lot of comparisons to especially the first film (having been released before the second, though saw 'Annabelle' after seeing the 'Conjuring' films) hoping it would be in similar vein, purposefully not reading too many reviews (those read disappointingly indicating otherwise).'Annabelle' unfortunately turned out to be a disappointment. Have definitely seen far worse films, horror and overall (it's not even one of the worst of 2014), 'Annabelle' is not irredeemable. It sadly has a lot of faults that makes it a very lacklustre film, and if briefly comparing it to 'The Conjuring' it is nowhere near being in the same ball park. It is a shame because it does start off very well. It is creepy to start with and the Manson-esque attack is unsettling and staged very well. It looks good too, nicely shot and the set design and late 60s setting are both beautiful and atmospheric to look at. Similarly well done is the score, which does have many haunting moments. The titular character has moments of creepiness. Unfortunately, there are times where she could have done with more expression. 'Annabelle's' biggest problems though is that when it goes downhill, which it does do rapidly far too early, it is not scary, nor is it particularly interesting. Tension and suspense is nowhere near enough and the too infrequent scares are obvious and going-through-the-motions like. Didn't feel much palm-sweating or heart-stopping here. Much of it is basically formulaic storytelling, that is also on the dull side, and a constant ticking off of predictable shocks and familiar genre tropes, the type of scares the film is over-reliant on having no build up or suspense. Furthermore, 'Annabelle' has a banal script that has no flow or substance and direction that suggests their heart was not in it or at ease with the material. The pacing on the most part is perfunctory and the acting has little distinction, not amateurish but nobody stands out. The characters are not easy to engage with with so little development or much personality, while the ending is one big rushed anti-climax and things do get ridiculous and silly as the film progresses to an increasingly intensifying degree.Concluding, lacklustre. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

Started watching it and it all came back. I found myself making jokes outloud instead of being ""scared"". Like when the boring wife hears the sewing machine and comes around the corner, I said watch Annabelle is making something. 
How about, I can't live in that house anymore, so instantly move into an apt that is 3 times the size of the house before. Yeah I'd be happy too. 
Oh you threw away that creepy doll and now it's somehow in the moving box in our new place? I know, it's perfect overlooking the crib. You see the scary cult lady, that killed herself in your tiny house, while holding that creepy doll... it's not a bad idea to leave the baby alone while you go down to the buildings basement to recycle a box. 
The scariest part in the movie was watching that poor adorable baby have books falling all around her. Honestly it was pretty bad. Like someone else said, the movie is the demon playing with a doll instead of the possessed doll we all came to see."
" Nice horror movies

This movie is an averegly good horror, that rely a bit too much on cliches and ghost movements to build the mood, but that is enough well shot, well acted and well written to be enjoyable and fun. In ten years we won't look back at this movie as a game changer, but I will remember it like a fun movie. Isn't it enough to reach at least a 6.0 average or a 50 in metacritic score? I think yes, specially after i see on this website that horror masterpiece hardly reach 6.0 and that being part of marvel cinematic universe give a movie the right to at least a 7.0.
Do me a favor, before you give a vote to an horror movie stopfor a second, thuink to your previous votes and ask yourself if you are being fair to the movie or just misjudging a gente.To comment the movie i think is a nice add to the conjuring universe...if this is the lowest entry( as a lot of people say) is the signal of how much quality, despite the clear commercial intentions, this movies are bringing on screen. The movie look good and the plot, even if not really original, is a good mix of ""influences"" and is not boring or cringy. Some scenes are really creepy and some jump scares are really good( yes jumpscares are not necessary a sin), but the general atmosphere of the movie is not too much haunting so you will walk out of the cinema without paranoia and nigthmares( if you don't sleep with dools in the room)."

" Low point for the franchise, but not one to skip
",-0.1406,0.9567,2018-09-13 00:00:00,4,"This is by far the weakest movie I've seen from The Conjuring franchise, which I almost expected seeing as most of marketing seemed to be riding on the creepiness of the Annabelle doll they have created.The plot of this movie left a lot to be desired, but the whole story seemed like exactly what it was, a spin-off. I felt no real connection to any of the characters, and to be honest, I couldn't have cared less if they lived or died. The rest of the franchise has put a lot of emphasis on character development, but I didn't feel any of that in this movie.I don't have much to say about the acting, which I suppose is a good thing. Great scream-queen material from Annabelle Wallis, which could have saved this movie if they had given me even the slightest reason to care about her character. As with the rest of the series, the look and sound of this movie is top quality, and you can tell there is a lot of expertise that goes into the cinematography and sound design of this movie. I thought the scares were one of this films best qualities, with a few moments that really made my jaw drop, but unfortunately there were too many lulls between these moments to keep my full attention throughout.With all that being said this is a perfectly competent horror movie that is more than worthwhile if you are a horror fan, and absolutely not one to miss if you are a fan of the Wan/Flanagan brand of horror."
" Annabelle: you ugly!
",-0.5562,-0.997,2018-09-08 00:00:00,5,"When medical student John (Ward Horton) buys a rare vintage doll for his pregnant wife Mia (Annabelle Wallis), the last thing he expects is for his gift to become a source of unimaginable evil, but that's precisely what happens after Manson-like Satanic cultists violently attack the couple in their home and somehow turn the doll into a conduit for a demon.There's a nail-biting moment in Annabelle where Mia is absent-mindedly using a sewing machine, her fingertips getting nearer and nearer to the rapidly moving needle. It promises to be very nasty indeed, but winds up being frustratingly tame. That's the main problem with Annabelle: it never really delivers. Take the film's demon, for example: it provides a handful of lame jump scares, but it never actually does any serious harm. A freaky scene that sees Mia in an elevator that repeatedly arrives on the same floor had potential, director John R. Leonetti skillfully cranking up the tension, his evil creature lurking in the dark poised to strike, but in the end Mia easily escapes via some stairs to her apartment. I wanted to be terrified, but I wasn't.The other issue I have with Annabelle is this: who the hell would make such a freakin' ugly doll in the first place? In reality, no-one would buy something that repulsive. They'd be hard pushed to give the damned thing away, yet John pays a small fortune for the doll and his wife is only too pleased when she sees it. At least Chucky was reasonably cute (before his face got all messed up, that is)."

The couple starts to observe some terrifying supernatural occurrences that involve a vintage doll.I expected more from this movie and had high expectations because I had previously watched the movie ""The Conjuring"" and since there was a connection between these movies I had some expectations from it. I did not notice the budget of this film before I watched it which is only $6.5 million something that's obvious in the whole duration of the movie. There are not so many scary scenes and the few they are in this film they are old school, they do scare you but I expected more because I compared it with ""The Conjuring"". I liked the plot which was simple and gave us some information regarding the connection of this movie with ""The Conjuring"". I liked the interpretation of Annabelle Wallis who played as Mia and she was very good in this role. To sum up I have to say that ""Annabelle"" is an interesting movie for anyone to watch. It's a good average - medium horror movie which introduces us to this satanic vintage doll and makes us expect even more in the future.

The plodding plot might as well be on a treadmill, the characters are as dull as safety scissors, the story makes little to no sense and the scares are so aggressively puerile that you'll struggle to even pay attention to most of them, especially considering that the feature itself is one of the most painfully boring I have seen in a long while.

The problem with so much emphasis on that prop: a forsaken story whose linearity fails to build tension, and also makes the plot easily predictable.Acting was bad (specially that of Mia). Additionally, we have plot holes. For instance, there were no solid basis on why Anabelle decided to possess that specific doll and haunt that specific family. Would have she attacked the Forms had not John enterd her parents' house that night? If the demon's ultimate goal was to ""devour"" (?) a soul, why waste so much time haunting a mother and not just take away the baby as soon as possible? Also, why on earth would Evelyn get so deeply involved with that family to the point of taking her own life to save the baby?Maybe there are more unanswered questions, but my point has been made."

It's definitely not a splatter nor a thriller nor a teeny-screamy, so don't expect one. This is a movie of a young family that is haunted by evil.

That's something an old lady who has lived alone would own. That or 20 cats 3: after they move to an apartment after the first hauntings, the doll is in a moving-box even though Ken threw it away. And Barbie is not freaked out by this at all and decides to keep the doll?? 4: after Barbie and Ken and the clich√©-priest finds out that the doll is possessed by a demon, they don't destroy the doll, which would probably destroy the demon as well. No Barbie throws it around and yells at it. And the priest takes the doll with him to his church where he is almost killed by the demon.5: as for the exercising couple that is not even in the movie, they're boring as well.The Conjuring movies suck!!And a franchise about that couple just don't work.6: the exercising couple keep the doll in a glass box to keep the demon trapped. Again, destroy the doll and destroy the demon.7: why did this movie get an R-rating? There is no blood in it, no nudity, no swearing. And it's not even scary. It feels like a low budget made for TV horror movie. Apart from a few creepy scenes and only one good scare, this movie isn't worth watching.

",-0.4404,0.9526,2017-09-30 00:00:00,6,"I've been on a Conjuring series binge recently. I enjoyed Conjuring 1 & 2 and rated them both 10/10. This spin off, Annabelle, however... unfortunately this one was kinda weak, not in the same class as the other two. Now I'm just hoping the sequel, Annabelle: Creation, will be an improvement.Something about this one just didn't work that well. I guess, one problem would be that the scares seemed over-reliant on some of the same repeated tricks: flickering lights, or some machine turning on when no one's around, or sounds of a baby crying, or something appearing in the room behind a character. The movie repeated these tricks so often that throughout the movie I actually found myself constantly correctly guessing what kind of trick is going to be coming next.And everything felt a little too static. In other words, motionless, if you know what I mean. The premise does revolve around a doll, of course, but for too much of the time in this movie, the scares are supposed to be coming from nothing that's visibly moving on screen and that just ends up kind of unexciting.There was also a problem with some underdeveloped characters and potential plot lines that go nowhere: The kids on the stairs, the noisy upstairs neighbors, the bookstore owner whose occult connections were barely explained, etc.I should end with some positive though. Annabelle Wallis is pretty good at acting scared and has no hint of her real-life English accent when she speaks, so let's all applaud her acting talents.And the best moment in the movie involved a child running towards a closing door. I won't say anymore, except that it was a great scene and I'm really astonished that they managed to achieve that shot, however they did it."
" Pros and Cons, but good for a spook
",0.5927,0.624,2017-09-07 00:00:00,7,"Released back in 2014, Annabelle is a movie that got a lot of attention in the horror genre. Based off the story of the original Annabelle doll, locked away in a museum for the occult, director John R. Leonetti brings to life one of the most iconic haunted doll stories known in history. I am utterly terrified of dolls, and I think that might have been why I found this film as scary as I did. I was surprise to find it had quite a low rating on IMDb, especially with the sequel just coming out before I watched the film. I fully believe this deserves a slightly higher rating than what it got.First of all, Annabelle Wallis was an absolutely amazing actress and stole the show completely. She did a spectacular job and she was easy to relate to; it was easy to feel the fear she was going through throughout the film ‚Äì especially the basement scene. Following Annabelle, I am more than eager to go through her filmography and find more of her acting skills. She was just wonderfully talented.Unfortunately, this film does rely on a lot of old tricks of the paranormal genre. The seeing things, the writing on the wall, the demon chase up the stairs, and although terrifying, I would have loved to see more from this that wasn't the same as everything else in the genre. I feel like the directors and script writers could have done a lot more development with this. I am aware they were following the original real life story of Annabelle, but they could have enhanced it, made it a little more scary and not just another trope.There were cons and pros about this, and unfortunately, there were quite a few more cons than there were pros. However, this was still quite a good horror film, for the current age, and I'd definitely recommend this to those who enjoy being spooked."
" Not bad
",0.431,0.0811,2017-09-03 00:00:00,7,"I did watch this film several years ago but I had to re-watch it to make some pieces together after Annabelle: Creation.Actually, I like this part better, though I can not say that Creation is worse. I just think that this one was more entertaining and had some really scary scenes, unlike Creation.I also felt like some parts of this film were missing. The murder scene of their neighbors (done by their daughter) which is also used in Creation is kinda unexpected and when you think about it - kinda improbable. Especially what they were to do next. I guess there are many small details in this one and later in creation that does not really fit... but overall when you watch the films, you don't think about them.The librarian was an interesting character. I can not stop thinking of her role in Desperate Housewives.All in all, not bad. Rating: 6,6."
" ""A below average movie, they tried to make this movie extremely scary but failed miserably""
",-0.9051,-0.8663,2017-09-03 00:00:00,5,This movie is the prequel to the conjuring. The story of the doll how did it become the famous Annabelle we all know now.It started good those scary scenes were hitting the right notes then I felt they tried to make it extremely scary but turned out to be funny. There were some scenes which made me realize that this movie is being rushed just to make up something for the viewers. This movie made the conjuring doll a joke. I felt the leading actress did a really bad job as she literally had no fear on her face. The ending was so dumb they tried to make it unpredictable but utter rubbish. If you have watched the trailer of this movie then u have watched the whole movie cause those are the scary elements you have to see in the whole movie. They did a pretty good job in making a really good trailer and forcing us into the theaters to send us back home disappointed.No I would not recommend this movie to anyone.Notable ActingNobodyMy Rating 5/10
" Good Movie To Watch...While Folding Laundry

But I'm getting ahead of myself¬Ölet's start with the story. A man buys a super creepy doll for his pregnant wife ‚Äî she collects dolls, even ugly, creepy ones that would give Charles Manson nightmares ‚Äî and then they get attacked by cultists. A female cultist named Annabelle is killed by the police, and her body is found cradling the creepy doll. Does the couple move out? Nope. Do they get rid of the doll that was cradled by the serial killer woman during her final moments? Nope. Do creepy, evil things start to happen soon after that? Yup! The clueless couple eventually accept that they are being haunted, and after befriending a woman (played by Alfre Woodard) who has some experience with the supernatural, they figure out what is haunting them, and why. How to stop the powerful, malevolent force¬Öwell, that's not so easy.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Annabelle"" is the scene when Annabelle levitates, and the evil force that is making her rise is shown.""Annabelle"" is told with a leisurely pace ‚Äî many would call it boring and slow, but I didn't mind it too much because it revealed much of the mindset of the female half of the couple, and that mindset is crucial to the finale. What I did have a problem with is that the scares were too few and far between; and the Woodard character did something at the end which I found to be out of character. Although there was a scene in the second act that was supposed to set up what Woodard did at the end, it still made no sense after I analyzed Woodard's words and actions. It just completely took me out of the movie and my mind was screaming ""Shenanigans!"" Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Disappointed in the Acting of the Main Character
",-0.4767,0.9655,2017-08-23 00:00:00,4,"After watching Conjuring, I felt really excited when I knew that Annabelle will have a movie. I'm a horror fan that's why even if I really don't know much about making a movie but still I trust my own point of view if the horror movie that I'm watching is good or awful. Well, let me talk about the movie first, the effects was really great and very much appreciated the scene where the main character was looking at the little girl in the next room then suddenly run to her and show that creepy woman. It was really great. But the main character, the mother. .I don't know but her acting wasn't good at all! Maybe acting skill like Vera Farmiga and the one who acts as mother in the Insidious 1 and 2 (sorry I forgot the name) would really give justice to the movie. Just imagine, there are times in the movie where i really don't see or feel any frightening emotions on the mother's face - I just don't like her acting that truly ruins the movie (in my own point of view) because in all scenes, she has the scene were ""supposedly"" take the movie into a more scary one but she always fails to do so.However, the movie was good but I will never want to see that actress again in a horror movie because if she does, i will never have a chance even glimpse at it."
" The odd decent scare but disappointing overall
",-0.7935,-0.916,2017-08-11 00:00:00,5,"As someone who loved the original 'Conjuring' movie, and 2016's sequel for that matter, 'Annabelle' was a must-see for me. After reading some scathing reviews beforehand, I wasn't expecting much from this film. Whilst I didn't think it was as bad as some have suggested, 'Annabelle' certainly doesn't come close to reaching the same heights as 'The Conjuring' did, which was a seriously scary film.The scares in 'Annabelle' are few and far between and quite predictable, but there are a few scenes that do make you jump. Unfortunately, one of 'Annabelle' main flaws is its failure to build up any sort of tension, which is partly down to its thin plot. Most of the film felt quite tame, even the ending which was something of an anti-climax. Maybe this film has been judged too harshly by comparing it to 'The Conjuring'. It's not a bad horror film, but I expected more."

Mia (Annabelle Wallis) is an expectant mother and doll collector who is given the porcelain figure as a present from her husband John (Ward Horton). He doesn't believe her when she says she hears a scream from the neighbors but investigates to find the neighbors bleeding. Mia is attacked by followers of a satanic cult and the woman cultist, Annabelle Higgins, kills herself when the cops arrive, bleeding into the doll's eye. Mia recovers from a stab wound to her stomach, though her child is still alive inside her. Strange noises start to sound in the night and weird occurrences like the sewing machine coming on as the doll shifts.John throws the doll in the garbage when Mia is disgusted by it being held by the murderous woman. When all the stoves mysteriously turn on starting a fire and something grabs her leg, Mia is taken to the hospital and has the baby. They move to a new apartment and attend a church service with a congregation led by Father Perez (Tony Amendola). Somehow, the Annabelle doll shows up again much to John's concern but Mia wants to keep it. She meets her neighbor Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) but is also haunted by a strange woman walking around her house while she sleeps. She sees strange things and tries to convince her husband who turns to the church.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" Ghost story or demon saga?
",-0.3182,-0.5751,2017-07-24 00:00:00,7,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by John R. Leonetti, ""Annabelle"" stars Annabelle Wallis & Ward Horton as a young couple in Southern Cal suburbia in the aftermath of the Manson murders (1969-1970). The focus is on the former who's pregnant and gives birth in the first half. Meanwhile their house and, later, apartment is cursed and it's somehow linked to their creepy-looking vintage doll and a couple of Manson-ish occultists who invade their home in the first act. Tony Amendola plays their priest while Alfre Woodard is on hand as a concerned book store owner. This movie surprised me. I thought it was going to be a silly killer doll flick, like the Child's Play franchise, but that's not the case. While there are elements of a ghost story, this is more a demon tale; and the details to this effect are commendable. The movie's austere with a couple of genuinely scary episodes, particularly the basement/stairwell sequence. The CGI 'monster' is effectively realized and wisely not overdone.""Annabelle"" shows how the Manson murders were the death knell of the 'peace & love' counter-culture movement. Hippies would never be viewed the same after the horrific Tate murders of August 8, 1969. The drug-addled Woodstock took place just days later and it was indeed 'three days of peace & music,' but The Altamont Speedway Free Festival in early December (less than four months later) put the kibosh on the hippies' idealism forever. It's a shame too, as they had a hold of something real underneath their drug-obsessed fog (not that all hippies were druggies, but it was certainly the norm). If I may put forth a slice of personal philosophy, this movie illustrates how demons are viewed as the epitome of what is scary in modern culture. Yet the bible shows them SHRIEKING IN HORROR at the mere sight of the Mighty Christ. More than that, they BEG HIM not to torture them and throw their filthy backsides into the Abyss! Read it for yourself in Luke 8:26-31. THE MOVIE RUNS 99 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles. WRITER: Gary Dauberman.GRADE: B+"
" Underrated movie??

The story line is good enough. Though there is some questionable moments, but, overall I just enjoyed it. At least this is far better than many other horror films like 'It Follows'."
" Consistent Quality With The Rest OF The Conjuring Series
",0.0,-0.423,2017-07-12 00:00:00,9,"I've been a big fan of The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2, and somehow only discovered this movie just now. In my opinion, this movie is scary. Now, what is scary is obviously different from person to person. But one thing I think everyone should be able to agree on with this film, is that being scary is at least the goal of the writers and producers. A lot of films under the category of horror, don't necessarily have fear as their primary goals. For example, movies like Cabin in the Woods, which are comedies with a horror theme.In contrast with the rest of The Conjuring series, this film starts a bit slower, and gets stronger towards the end. Also, the intensity of the story line isn't on the same level. In my opinion, this gives Annabelle a slight advantage over The Conjuring, since I become desensitized to threats on screen if they become too intense."

We expected more jumpscares, more creepy-eerie, more like SCARY at all. What we got: Few jumpscares and... that's all. So predictable movie, we didn't even got scared, maybe once or twice, just one of us was scared at all time. He liked it... but it was just him. It wasn't that good as we expected, so we do not recommend this movie, but if you want... Try it"
" Not perfect, but more than worth a Movie Night spot.
",0.1946,0.9439,2017-06-29 00:00:00,6,"As a spin-off from The Conjuring I think there was a two sided mind set on this movie before the writers had even typed ""The End"". Some likely waiting to compare it to The Conjuring, others followed the fact that a spin-off cant make a good movie. For me both were wrong.This movie isn't The Conjuring at all, and in my opinion does brilliantly as a stand alone movie. I though the story line was near perfect for what the film had to achieve in its ending, the story was quiet overall but very sharp when it had its moments. And this is something that personal preference takes the reins with. I think the story would have got overcooked with much more than what was there in terms of horror ""Action"".Annabelle Wallis did very well in this movie too I think, a very well cast character, light and serene always makes for a better main character in these types of movies for me.I see this movie as a movie all of it own that just happens to explain a small part in The Conjuring rather than a spin- off. Its well worth the time to watch it."

This film I had low expectations going in and after seeing it..I kinda liked it! Although,the film got literally awful reviews with people commenting it down as 'the worst horror film of 2014',I can kind of get that,I mean,I had some flaws with it,like the amount of scenes that just left you hangin there like '..eh,is something gonna happen or eh..' and the predictable characters,but overall,passing that,this film was pretty cool and good,but it was,obviously,no where near as good as The Conjuring 1 or 2. Annabelle is a pretty good horror film with some effective scares and scenes,but overall in ways,is just another one of those horrors teens see for a good scare to get videos of your friends scared crapless and post it on Snapchat"
" Not terrible but not time worthy.
",-0.3252,-0.481,2017-06-25 00:00:00,5,"A demon that has possessed a porcelain doll terrorizes a pregnant wife an her husband in sunny Santa Monica California.Anyone who saw Peaky Blinders will know that Annabelle Wallace, a fresh face in the industry, has talent. She brings much of the same mellow composure and grace that make her as beautiful inside as out; the kind of pure soul that is perfect for the haunting. There are times however when her refinement is so great that she seems not very impressionable. It's not like the movie needs a scream queen, but she fails to summon much fear or motivation from it.Annabelle is only an hour and a half long, but it feels substantially longer. The first half of the movie, is often so light in tone that it feels like a 60's soap opera that just happens to have horror devices. Director John Leonetti lets the movie drag along without a clear sense of direction. IF nothing else, at least he has a good eye for framing. The photography, which has a wide lens feel, is a blessing to a movie that is full of cursing. The best shots in the movie are the static framings that squeeze two or three rooms into the picture. These moments work by daring the viewer to search for what is not there. Absence is always more intimidating than presence. For the most part, this is not a scary movie. There is too much chaos and the images hinging on boo moments are all gimmicks that we have seen before; the self moving doors, phonographs, ghosts in white sleepers, the black biblical demon. The all thats missing is the cat jumping out of the shadows. The catalyst for all this unnatural mumbo jumbo, The doll who looks like an ancestor of Chucky. Leonetti likes to linger on her face just long enough to make you suspect that her eyes are gonna spring out of her skull. those who don't get goosebumps will probably find these shots somewhat amusing. The film gives you enough down time to contemplate how anything with a face like that could ever end up on the market."

If you want to see a really scary movie. Then see this movie. It is very scary. It will scary you. If it does not scary you no movie will. It is very scary. It is scary then The Exorcist and that is not easy to do. It is true the The Conjuring is scarier. So is The Conjuring 2. But that is about the only two movie that are scarier.

" Entertaining horror film
",-0.2023,0.9886,2017-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Annabelle is a spin off movie from the conjuring. Not really a sequel, it has no relation to the conjuring other than the Annabelle doll itself. Ed and Lorraine Warren are referenced but they aren't actually in the movie. It focuses on a couple that is getting ready to have a baby and they are living next door to an older married couple that has an adult daughter that's run away and joined a cult. At some point the daughter of the couple returns home and her and the other members of her cult do some very bad things.... and that leads to a demon possessed doll named Annabelle. The couple starts to experience mysterious goings on once they're baby is born and they've moved to a new home. With the help of a priest and a friend (Alfre Woodard) they try everything to keep their family safe and get rid of the evil. I really liked the actors and thought they did well with their roles. I liked Woodard's performance a lot, she was a very sentimental character, a newfound friend of Mia that helps them fight the demon. Annabelle Wallis (what a coincidence lol) was very good as Mia, the new mother who is the first to notice these satanic occurrences. I also thought that ward horton was convincing and a good pick to play the loving father/husband of the endangered family. The movie has some genuinely frightening moments. One of those moments being when Mia sees the demon in human form, that scene was scarier to me than anything in the conjuring or in the rest of Annabelle. I was scared more overall by this film than the conjuring. If you like a good horror movie, I suggest Annabelle. The ending is good too, meaningful in a way. 8/10."

His whiny over protective wimp of a partner is just as annoying in my opinion. I feel nothing for them, which creates my first big dilemma as in a horror you kind of need to give some what of a dam what happens to your protagonists to feel unnerved and scared 'for' them right? Annabelle the doll is kinda creepy.But that is literally all. This movie is droll and predictable I could pre guess every minute of it. I know it's based on ""experiences"" relating to the Warrens but as I don't care for them I really was left feeling nothing at the end of this one.I went into it expecting very little luckily so wasn't under any false illusions."

Annabelle was facing two very stiff obstacles. 1.) It was following the very successful The Conjuring2.) Scary doll movies had already been done (see Child's Play and Dead Silence to name a couple). Not to mention other movies in which a creepy doll came into play (such as Poltergeist or countless other movies in which a doll turns its head or moves)Annabelle just didn't deliver. A husband buys his wife this doll as a gift to complete her set. After a tragic event the doll becomes a conduit for evil.

",0.0,0.8417,2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Annabella I decided to watch this tonight because I watched on live cam them moving the original Annabella from its original case to another case . Not 100% sure why I think it was more of a portable case so they can carry around to take on lectures . and feed naughty kids to . They wore protected gloves and said a prayer then lifted her from its place and placed into the other case then said another prayer. It was a interesting watch but not much to it and only lasted around 8mins, I was expecting a bit more, example a bit of history and background of the doll & story, and maybe a closer look of the doll before putting it into its case ..Now let's be fair we all have some interest in supposedly true stories like these . I say supposedly because I'm referring to ghost \ possession \ haunted etc stories like Amityville horror etc where stories of serial killers we know are true and did happen . Now to me I honestly don't believe the whole Annabella story and there no real proof to back it up except the owners story ...and what they say Now if you don't know anything about the story films like these slightly irritate me because it had no real connection at all about the doll except the film was based on a doll and really used Annabella name to cash in and get a wider and bigger audience. And if you don't know that then you would walk away from the cinema thinking this was the story... After all i had to once explain to someone paranormal activity wasn't true .. But she wouldn't have it because at the end before titles it gave a brief outline of the story as if it was true and because of that she believed it was true otherwise why write that at the end ..face palmThe film itself was half decent and watchable but several element's of the film annoyed me , like for starters scare tactics .. Was there any ? Where the music suddenly BOOMs making you reach for the remote control ready to turn it down..and making you jump in same way as if you walking along street and a friend jumped out from nowhere and loudly shouted boo, NO need that's not scare tactics more of giving you a bloody heart attack tactics, a horror will scare you and keep you edge of your seat on what's happening with atmospheric music in the background. Several scenes reminded me of other horrors like Exorcist and omen where she was pushing the pram with the child in, she had both hands on the pram, then suddenly bent down to pick her keys up that she dropped, while doing so the pram rolled into the road and got hit by a truck.. But that's OK the child was safe because she had hold of it in her arms close to her chest. was this some sort of magic trick to impress pen & teller I like to know if it fooled them in how she did it. Personally if I was to watch a story based on something true like a doll , I would watch a independent film of it than a Hollywood film for several reason, but main reason being is the makers of the indie film would research the story and try to stick as closely as they could to supposedly the real facts, where the Hollywood film would put there own spin on it and exaggerate to suit themselves ."
