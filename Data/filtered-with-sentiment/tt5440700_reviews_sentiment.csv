The cinematography of the movie is fantastic. Vijay gives his careers best performance. G.V Prakash has gives a super BGM & music.It contains the all necessary ingredients to entertain everyone.

" Theri is a revenge drama that is compiled with entertaining moments
",-0.128,0.9979,2021-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Vijay is uniting for the first time with Atlee in Theri. After proving himself in Raja Rani, Atlee has a very big responsibility in making a film that satisfies Vijay fans. On the other side, we have Vijay who is expecting a comeback with Theri after the debacle of Puli. So, Theri is very important for both of them, and let's see how it worked? Well, Theri is nothing new in terms of content. It's the same revenge drama that we have seen throughout the past decades but Atlee made it fresh with his treatment and presentation. He made a Vijay film that revolves around Vijay. It's not surprising but Atlee makes it more interesting by adding different layers to Vijay's character. In the first half, Vijay is introduced as Joseph Kuruvilla and we find out that later that he has another identity that he hides for the safety of his daughter. Well, there are some shades of Baashha and Chatriyan in this film but the way it's presented is refreshing. Vijay who is lifting this film on his shoulders delivered a memorable performance in this film. Beside him, we have Baby Nainika making a brilliant debut in her very first Tamil film. Her cute performance is a huge delight. We have Samantha playing the main female lead and her performance in the flashback is heart touching. The other supporting actors have very little scope in this film but we should take the time to appreciate the performance of Director Mahendran and Rajendran. Mahendran who is playing his very first antagonist role has done a great job. Rajendran who takes care of the comedy scenes is pleasant to watch on screen. G.V.Prakash delivers a satisfying album which is of course his 50th film. His background score is a huge pillar in adding the needed intensity to the film. Theri is definitely a well-made film and there's a strong work that has been in the background by the technicians. Coming to Atlee, we have seen the level of sincereness that he has in making a proper commercial entertainer, and in Theri, he made a film as a Vijay fan for the hardcore Vijay fans. Again, the typical issue that this film has it's the run time. Well, the second half is too slow and needs to be cut down. There are some unwanted scenes that slow down the overall pace of the film. There are so many subplots that could have been avoided because again, it lacks focus on the main plot. I need to say that Atlee has added an important social message that is pretty well delivered through this film. Overall, Theri is a revenge drama that is compiled with entertaining moments."
" I, for one.., am T(H)ER(R)IFIED !!
",0.0,-0.9885,2019-10-27 00:00:00,4,"THERI = SCARY !!Why ? Was it not supposed to be a sleek action entertainer ?First up, if it is a solace enough .. I concede, that Theri is definitely not in the league (or, should I say, twenty thousand leagues under the sea) of Sura and is much better than his previous outing - Puli .. by some distance !So..What is so scary about Theri ??Not the done to death story (if you can call it that) line.. We have seen several such star vehicles with much less.Definitely not the audacity of presenting Amy Jackson as a Mallu school teacher. Should we credit the casting department's spine or funny bone ??Not even the adventurist streak of the director Atlee in making Vijay (definitely looking good) emote (??) and cry more than we have seen him do in the past decadeNot the inane ensemble of villains who barely register (by the way.. I am still puzzled as to why veteran director Mahendran agreed to become a prime contender for the most insipid and predictable villain of the decade??)Not the revival of the long buried tradition of hero slugging it out with that muscle man foreign ""motta boss"" in the final fight sequenceCertainly not the ""ghost apparitions in the smoke"" horror film act of an avenger VijayNor his attempts to ape the famous famous Scarlett Johanson's introductory action sequence as Black Widow strapped to a chair from the first Avengers movieNo.. No... No..The scariest part of the movie comes in the final few minutes when we find Vijay, having vanquished the villains down south and having shifted his base with his daughter, aide and Amy in tow, to (I guess) Ladakh ( a la Yennai Arindhaal ??), receives a package which gives the hint of some new assignment.That is Atlee, in all his ruthless and merciless cruelty, threatening us with a possible (& quite probable, given the current trends in Kollywood) sequel.Now.. That's a REAL SCARY THOUGHT to walk out of the hall with .. a thought which could visit you in your sleep as a VIVID NIGHTMARE !!"

" Seriously!!
",-0.3147,-0.8362,2019-10-08 00:00:00,3,"This movie has nothing new to vijay's previous movies
Just some action here and a few songs there and revenge couldn't make up for the poor plot. Another movie with sentiments to arouse the emotions of the viewers. Not good"
" Great comeback
",0.6249,0.7184,2019-08-14 00:00:00,10,Everyone should appreciate Thalapathy for giving a worth comeback after an average film with young director... Theri rocked and proved that he is the box office king after Superstar...

" Theri (2016)
",0.0,-0.7447,2018-03-22 00:00:00,5,The movie was not so good. This is an as usual Police story with no new method. Songs were worst. BGM was amazing. Some scenes were very boring. Some scenes were unbelievable.
" Disgusting & irritating...
",-0.5267,-0.6885,2018-01-11 00:00:00,1,"I wonder which kind of people make this type garbage movie!! There are a lots of dumb and zombie like people live in the world, they watch anything and enjoy.!! But the movie directors should have some brain. directors shouldn't be like common assholes. They have some duty towards people and the society. So if you can't make any good movie , please don't make any ."
" A mess made out of an otherwise talented cast.
",0.2023,0.752,2017-07-14 00:00:00,4,"So, before writing my review, I would like to inform you that I am an Odia who watched the movie with English subtitles. So there may be some things I missed. I apologise in advance. Before watching Theri, I had watched another movie of Vijay, Kaththi, and I was super impressed. I watched this movie with a lot of expectations, and I'm disappointed. First, I have a problem with the story. It's nothing new. Even before the interval, one can guess what happens at the end. Some scenes are extremely cringy, like the last song and the climax. Then, Vijay's acting in this movie was weak in many instances. Amy Jackson was a mistake. There were a few positives, though. Baby Nainika was super adorable. Samantha also performed her role well. The chemistry between Vijay Kumar and her mum were good. But overall, they can't save the film. In conclusion, I give it 4 stars. I can understand how someone would give it 7, but 10/10, seriously? It also raises a dilemma. In case someone powerful does an inhuman act, should the police behave as the protagonist did?"
