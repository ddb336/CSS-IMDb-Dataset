" Deeply unsettling and strange
",-0.2648,-0.9726,2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,"I have to appreciate the sheer strangeness of this movie, even if I'm not sure I actually enjoyed it. I'm not even sure it was meant to be enjoyed.While not especially gory by the standards of this type of film, ""The Voices"" includes some imagery that I found profoundly disturbing - chiefly those plastic containers Ryan Reynolds so carefully stacks in his apartment. I almost turned the thing off at that point. But I stuck with it, and I guess I'm glad I did, though I could have done without the goofy, over-the-top sequence that plays under the closing credits.Many others have commented on the clever shifts and pointed contrasts between Reynolds' delusional world view and the ugly reality of his circumstances. What I've found interesting is trying to determine just where his hallucinations end.At one point, he sees a news report that his first victim's body has been found in the woods. The end of the report is clearly hallucinated; the sheriff directly addresses Reynolds through the TV. But when I thought about it afterward, it hit me that the entire news story, from start to finish, must be a hallucination. Reynolds did not leave the body in the woods, so it could not have been found there. All the stuff about the police searching for a serial killer is Reynolds' fantasy. (In fact, there's little indication anyone is even concerned about the missing woman.)Later, after Reynolds has killed two women, one of his' female coworkers comes to check on him. Naturally he kills her, too. I took this to be a real event. But now I have to wonder if the entire incident happened only in his mind. After all, it makes no sense for the coworker to show up at his place; she already knows that two of her colleagues are missing and that Reynolds may be mentally disturbed. So does she actually go there? Or does he just imagine the third murder? How much of what happens on screen ever ""really"" happens at all?Any film that makes you dwell on these questions for a couple of days is worth a watch - if you have the stomach for it. (Those plastic containers ...) Whether it's a ""good movie"" or not is hard to say, but it does stay with you."
" Ryan Reynolds is a gem.
",0.0,0.8701,2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,Weird movie for sure. Kind of hard to watch at times but just because Reynolds performance is so convincing. I don't know why I never heard of this movie but I'm glad I stumbled upon it.
" Incredibly disapointing
",0.0,-0.5219,2021-02-11 00:00:00,2,I was just fundamentally against what this movie was trying to do. The comedy of the actions that the characters took was not funny enough for me to ever want to see this again. I also found the ending deeply unfunny and troubling.
" Why haven't I heard of this before??
",0.0,0.938,2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely never heard of this movie before, but I'm glad I found it. What and entertaining movie, it was mixed with humor and it was also very dark. Ryan Reynolds really was creepy and nailed this character. I would highly recommend watching!"
" A schizo serial-killer you could love
",0.6369,0.7574,2020-11-19 00:00:00,7,"A delightful, quirky horror-com. Go you Marjane! I love everyone in it. The animals' characters were well pulled out of their looks. A schizophrenic factory worker doesn't stay on his meds, thus allowing him to hear the conversations inanimate objects and his pets are having without him when he does take them. Once he's back in the loop he takes their advice and wreaks a bit of havoc."
" It was a good effort
",0.4404,0.4944,2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,"Except from the last scene. Why put a song at the end? So out of place and dumb! The end ruined it for me. And we never saw if he died or he had just passed out thus hallucinations.
All in all it was an interesting film. Reynolds' performance was top notch, all in all good acting. The take on schizophrenia was very interesting and to a certain extend spot on. Much less of a comedy, much more gore than I expected. That is why I gave it a 6.Fun one time watch, I might suggest it to a few people who would be interested in such a thing, but not very likely to watch again."
" Good versus Evil
",-0.3612,0.693,2020-10-29 00:00:00,9,"Coming from UK, I was never a fan of Ryan Reynolds, who was mainly known here for advertising a major UK company. That changed with this film; he is absolutely brilliant as the good natured average Joe, victim of past events leaking into his subconscious, leading him to fight between the good and bad elements of his soul.
I am sure my soul is bad as I found the simple, good-hearted Bosco and the malign, smart assy Mr Whiskers equally adorable!"
" Wow. This is really bad
",0.0018,-0.9605,2020-10-19 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your time like I wasted mine, it's just a mess.
How could someone write this piece of garbage and be paid for it? This is so bad.
I have no words, I watched this in a complete shock for how incredibly bad this was.
I can't believe people read this and decided to make it anyway, and after the movie was finished they watched this mess and decided to charge people to watch it? How? Why on earth?"
" great movie funny at times but very dark
",0.5423,0.985,2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,I really enjoyed this movie the humor was great and on point and it helped from getting too dark even tho it does get pretty dark at times! Ryan Reynolds is great in the part you and his animals are just great defiantly a fun movie to watch while with a few friends or a quiet night of laughs and gore
" a horror movie packed in a box of chocolates
",-0.5719,0.9918,2020-10-10 00:00:00,7,"Marjane Satrapi bought her fame with the formidable ""Persepolis"", one of those books that promoted comics at the most serious artistic level, a largely autobiographical story describing the author's childhood during the Islamic revolution in Iran. After bringing this book to screen into an excellent animated film, Satrapi began a career as an actors feature films director, experimenting in different genres. 'The Voices' made in 2014 is the result of one of these experiments. It's a movie that may mislead if you look at the poster and even after watching about a quarter of it. It starts as a sweet romantic comedy in an American town. It continues in something completely different, gloomy and decadent, and those who are afraid of spoilers should better stop reading here. Fans of political correctness and those who are really scared by horror movies can also give up. The rest are invited to join the adventure.The story takes place in a very typical American town, where the main attractions are the bowling alley and the burgers and Chinese restaurants. Jerry (Ryan Reynolds), the hero of the film, works in a factory that packs something in big boxes, stacks them and ships them. Jerry looks good, he's a nice guy, the girls in the accounting and finance departments compete to be chosen by him for a date, and even his weirdness of talking loud with his dog and cat its (very cued pets, by the way) when coming home does not seem something to worry about, after all this happens all the time in the Disney studio movies. Maybe we should be a little worried about his regular visits to the psychologist, but she (excellently played by Jacki Weaver) seems more psychotic than her patient, a situation which often happens in reality. For me at least it was a surprise when the story went crazy. Really badly crazy.I liked the way Marjane Satrapi tells the story. It's a black comedy, a horror movie packaged as a romantic comedy with talking animals. When the romance and the voices of the animals turn out to be the visions of a serial killer, the viewer understands that everything until then was a very well executed convention. Fragments of reality are interspersed, but the vision remains that of the hero. If we are to look for a classic reference, then it would be Hitchcock's 'Psycho' if it had been filmed from the perspective of Norman Bates. Even when blood starts to flow, we are not allowed to completely enter the horror mood because it's then only that the romance between Jerry and Lisa begins, and Ryan Reynolds and Anna Kendrick are the perfect actors for a romantic comedy. The cinematography and the sets are excellently designed, and the bowling alley on the floor of which the hero's home is located has a chance to become a cult film setting. Don't make the mistake of leaving viewing when everything seems to be over, because the ending and the credits provide another commercial packaging for the horror story, that of a musical. Is the musical 'The Voices' in preparation for Broadway? I would not be that surprised."
" Utterly Reynolds
",0.0,0.9961,2020-09-30 00:00:00,10,"I always try to watch movies, when I can, without knowing anything about them. It's not easy, but on this occasion I managed it. I didn't even know it was Ryan Reynolds until I saw him on the screen. I knew literally nothing.Something about the titles had me expecting it to be low budget and rubbish. That's usually the way when there are multiple cheap extended logo things all shoehorned in before the movie. Then the words on the screen, no decent movie does that any more.Then... is that Ryan Reynolds? Yes, yes it is! Ok, maybe its gonna be good. Ryan Reynolds never does a bad film.I completely expected to be laughing through this movie from that point on. For a while I did, right up until the deer scene. Suddenly I was sat with my mouth wide open staring at the screen and wondering what on earth I was watching.Continuously after that point I was glued to this movie more than any movie in a long while. Nothing in this movie is predictable, and every part of it keeps you wanting to see what's next.As much as I despise the term 'fan,' I am a Ryan Reynolds fan. I like everything I've seen him in and don't think there's much I haven't seen now. So I can't help wondering if, had there been another actor in the lead of this movie, whether I would have liked it at all, because Ryan really did make this character extremely likeable, in a way that only he could. He seems to manage to keep that Ryan charm and yet still very much become the part no matter what that part is.The support in Gemma Arterton & Anna Kendrick was also a great casting. Both actresses were superb and fitted in perfectly. The dynamic between the three seemed completely natural.I'm clearly trying to justify myself here because I feel I shouldn't have liked this movie at all. But I did. Very much so. So watch it, just... not with the kids."
" Appreciate it for what it is
",0.4019,0.5595,2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,"You really need to take your mindset away from Ryan Reynolds' other roles and appreciate it for what it is. Exploring the mind of a seriously mentally ill schizophrenic man. The actual directing on this film is really good, it makes you feel so many conflicting feelings while watching, possibly just like someone would if they were Jerry. Definitely watchable"
" Worth a watch if Youre bored looking for a decent movie.
",-0.0516,0.872,2020-08-23 00:00:00,7,Maybe they shouldn't have made it a comedy but it was pretty good.
" Ryan Reynolds nailed it here, very enjoyable movie, much better than expected.
",0.7264,0.9977,2020-08-20 00:00:00,9,"To be honest I didn't have high expectations for this movie as Ryan Reynolds isn't my favorite actor but credit where credit is due he nailed it here, in fact I thought this was his best performance yet. To my surprise he did all the voice-overs, I would never have guessed that (I even waited for the end credits to clarify who did the voices for Mr. Whiskers, Bosco (voice), the deer and the bunny monkey). The conversations between him, his cat and dog were hilarious, much better than the usual speaking animals we sometimes get. The story itself was also very good, nothing beats a good story about a schizophrenic. It was interesting to follow, with some good humorous moments and some bloody gory parts. It's a dark comedy, one of the better ones if you want my opinion. Anna Kendrick and Gemma Arterton were the eye candy of this movie, both have a funny bone and added something special to this comedy. So if you like to wander in the mind of a schizophrenic combined with some humor The Voices will definitely suit you. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and will for sure watch it again in the future."
" Awesome, dark, funny and sad.
",0.5994,0.8176,2020-08-20 00:00:00,9,Ryan Reynolds at his best. His interpretation is flawless.
" I knew the ending within the first five minutes
",0.0,0.4854,2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"A 100% predictable movie within the first five minutes.I was watching the movie and when Jerry is getting dressed he is talking with Bosco. There is something that he says which sums everything up for the entire movie with one single sentence.I wish writers would pick up on this foreshadowing because it ruins the movie for some people. Removing that one line is a game changer from (1) star to possibly a (6) star movie.I like Ryan Reynolds, as an actor, but he plays the same person just with different intensities. You can actually see Van Wilder and Deadpool in this movie if you listen carefully.The ending was exactly how I thought it would end."
" Crushed by the weight of it's own ambition
",-0.4215,0.1301,2020-08-03 00:00:00,3,"Some of the reviews are so glowing, that I thought I was in for a treat, instead I was left irritated and frustrated. The casting, direction, and plot are all thin. I really wanted to stop watching, but I had to see where it was trying to go. Neither dark comedy or satire or horror or thriller, the whole thing feels confused. The animals are NOT funny but should have been. The psychosis aspect is not portrayed well at all, and I know Reynolds can do it ( see his version of ""The Amityville Horror""). I never felt any empathy or sympathy for any of the characters. Wow, this could have been done so much better, with a better script and direction."
" Strangely truthful in some ways
",0.2023,0.9026,2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"First Ryan Reynolds is brilliant in this role. The depiction of the good guy just in a bad psychological situation and the navigation between the two states of mind were brilliantly portrayed.
RR suffers from psychosis. He may be scizophreniac but frankly does not show any other symptoms. He basically hears voices (dog who represents his ""good"" self and cat the ""bad"" self) and has hallucinations. Typically when he is off his meds like he is most of the movie everything is beautiful and smells good while on the meds, he sees reality. The viewer sees the world as he sees it.
Our main character is basically a good guy he hates his meds as his vision of the world without them is so much nicer. I know for having had a friend who was on Th is type of meds that she would say the same. She also stopped taking them. She also missed her visions and talking to her ""friends"" (She was not dangerous). He wants to stay good but there is that part of him that wants to be bad. In most it would be subconscious and would never cause the person to become a murderer but in his case and in some real cases the subconscious has taken shape and the person no longer understands or has a real grip on reality so when that voice is constantly telling them they need to kill or do bad things they may fight it but some people like our protagonist end up following the voice. That is all very serious but This film is made with plenty of humour and comedic moments mixed in with some gorey bits. It's not scary but it's not your family comedy for sure. It's a light horror comedy. I really enjoyed it and fully recommend it."
" Brilliant, endearing, emotional ride
",0.6597,0.8994,2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,Came across this gem a while back. Loved it. Such a thought provoking take on mental illness. Ryan Reynolds really does excel in this role and his performance is brilliant.This is definitely an underrated film and should be more recognisable. It ebbs and flows from quietly serious to darkly comical which turns out to be an effective mix. Would always recommend!
" Well-done dark humour
",0.4767,0.7103,2020-05-24 00:00:00,7,"Gerry is a nice guy that works at a bathtub factory. Deliberately avoiding prescribed medications, delusions and hallucinations are normal part of his life. He usually talk to his good tempered dog, Bosco, and really mean cat, Mr Whiskers, that give him advices. When the guy pursues his office crush things starts to go south very fast and every inadvertently bad action causes a worst reaction in a spiral soon out of control.Overall this is a really well made and enjoyable black comedy. As usual, Ryan Rynolds is a likable lead. His performance and portrayal of mental illness really sticks out with some good exploration of his twisted past and bleak every day reality, originating a simpathetic character that needs help more than condemnation. The movie is greatly elevated by Rynolds performance, almost a solo one, especially looking at the rather flat supporting characters. As well, The cat and dog are masterfully voiced by Ryan."
" Waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.8241,2020-05-21 00:00:00,1,"Easily one of the worst movies I have ever watched.Spoiler:
It's not a comedy, it's a stupid gory film pretending to be deep, justifying a man who murders women.
I am appalled."
" A dark comedy that delivers!
",0.4199,0.938,2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,This kinds of movies is not for everyone's taste but I am quite sure that most people watching this wont get bored. I really enjoyed this movie and Ryan Reynolds did nail one of his best performance ever. Also everyone in cast was great and there was no forced unknown actors in there that shouldnt be there like most new movies we see nowadays.
" Not a comedy as advertised & not your regular Ryan Reynolds movie.
",-0.2755,0.7589,2020-04-30 00:00:00,3,"I was very disappointed with this movie, from the trailers, posters and movie tags, this film looked sure to be a mishap comedy - It was far from it.I made it through the whole film waiting for that one chuckle which Ryan Reynolds usually provides within his movies but I was left dumbfounded by the whole film.I was even hoping there would be light at the end of the dark tunnel for this film, maybe his love interest in Anna Kendrick would turn his life and mentality around, nope the ending just provided a song with all the dead characters including Reynolds himself singing a 'Happy Song' which seems quite offensive to Mental Health.Reynolds, Kendrick and Arterton provided great performances, but with how the film was shown to the public, especially as a comedy, those performances were lost in a 2 hour horror show of nothingness.My mistake was not looking at the reviews before watching the film, I saw the title had a 6.4 before watching which persuaded me it was a good title.3 stars, one for each of the three actors above mentioned, the others lost on a plot-less film."
" The Credits are the Best Part
",0.7717,-0.9215,2020-04-23 00:00:00,5,"This movie is a really mixed bag. Some things work really well, and others just don't make any sense at all. So, I will break down my thoughtsPros:
The credits are amazing and diffidently worth re-watching.
The first death came out of nowhere.
Anna Kendrick did great with what she was given.
The revelation about Jerry's childhood is heartbreaking.
Ryan Reynolds did pretty good with what he was given.
The talking heads were funny at first.Cons:
The acting from all the minor characters was terrible. Like you would've thought they got random people off the street to be in this movie.
The voices of the animals were so annoying and sounded like a rip off of Mike Myers. It was like Ryan Reynolds was auditioning for the next Austin Powers 4.
Gemma Arterton's character was a terrible person, but the film acts like we should care about her.
The characters are all idiots. No one ever calls the cops or even acknowledges that people are disappearing that it. No one realizes that Jerry has mental health problems even though it is super obvious he's not all there. No one ever bothered to do a background check on Jerry. Every character besides Jerry makes the worst possible decision, and it's just too unbelievable.
The plot is painfully predictable and slow. There also is no tension as there is never really a feeling that Jerry is going to get caught or the other characters are going to getaway.
Anna Kendrick's skills as an actor are largely wasted. Her character is one denominational and only likes Jerry bassed on his physical looks. And she is so desperate to hook up with him that it comes across as pathetic. To the point, I just wanted to scream at her character.
Also (spoiler) You never kill Anna Kendrick!!
Finally, I know I said the credits are the best part, but overall the ending is underwhelming, and I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel. I was just like that's it?So overall, I would say this movie is a 5 out of 10. It has a lot of problems, but it's worth watching once if for no other reason then to see Anna Kendrick. ."
" One of the few truly original and unique movies.
",0.6369,0.7688,2020-04-08 00:00:00,8,"You know, it's kind of crazy how little marketing this got. I would have had no awareness of this movie at all if I hadn't delibarately watched a compilation of trailors to upcoming movies, and then I saw or heard nothing about before stumbling across on a streaming service.And it's directed by Majane ""Persepolis"" Satrapi too, I mean...this movie is strange before we even begin...A terrifying movie.It feels like a comedy in the way it's scripted and visualized albeit a dark one and this is how I chose to access it at first. It really had no other choice since the (very convincing) talking animals plus a serious tone would just be risible.Ryan Reynold's interprets a very rich protagonist that holds a lot of the movie. He manages to be sympathetic in the depiction of mental illness. He's a little bit old school coocoo bananas in the performance at times but I am content to say this is as sensitive depiction of psychological as we could hope for.Handled with a sense of humor, seeing into this victim's mental prison is vivid and poignant and really helps one to understand why some people do not want to take their medication as their mind problems are not only a path to destruction but also a way they cope with a cold, bleak world conveyed with with magnificent visual flare.The ending will polarize. I personally think it was perfect."

",0.0,0.2975,2020-02-12 00:00:00,4,They should have made this movie darker with more real schizophrenia elements and less comedy and this may have worked.
" Interesting Look at Mental Illness and Medication with a Dark Twist
",0.0,0.9974,2020-02-11 00:00:00,8,"This was a film that I remember when it was coming out, but then it kind of just disappeared. When I got into listening to horror movie podcasts, this one would pop up periodically and I added it to my list of films to check out. I finally did when for my podcast, I decided for the month of February to do two episodes that featured a woman director. The synopsis is a likable guy pursues his office crush with the help of his evil talking pets, but things turn sinister when she stands him up for a date.Now this synopsis was a bit misleading. We are in the town of Milton, which is quite odd if I'm going to be honest as our introduction to it is somewhat surreal. There is music accompanying it, the town isn't very big and it is based around this factory that does bathroom fixtures. Working there is Jerry (Ryan Reynolds). He's called over by his boss, Dennis Kowalski (Paul Chadhidi), and invited to help plan their company barbeque. Through their conversation, we learn that Jerry has a court appointed psychologist.Jerry goes home to his pets, Mr. Whiskers the cat and Bosco the dog. The problem is that they're talking to him. Mr. Whiskers has a Scottish accent and both are actually done by Reynolds. He tells them about being picked for helping plan this where Bosco is happy, much like any dog would be, and Mr. Whiskers thinks it is stupid.Also on this committee is Fiona (Gemma Arterton) who Jerry has a crush on, along with John (Adi Shankar), Dave (Sam Spruell) and Sheryl (Alessa Kordeck). Fiona comes back to the meeting while Jerry is cleaning up to ask a question about the equipment and Jerry thinks he hears her say that she can come up to her department any time. The picnic is fun and Jerry comes up later to ask Fiona out. Lisa (Anna Kendrick) has a crush on him and asks him to join them for a drink. She wants him to take her home after, but instead he ends up driving Fiona home. He asks her out again on this drive and she reluctantly agrees. She ends up blowing him off though.Her car won't start and it is raining out. By happenstance, Jerry is passing by when Fiona needs help. She tries to make it up, but they end up hitting a deer and he kills it to put it out of his misery. This scares Fiona who flees into the woods. He runs after her and accidentally kills her. When he goes home, Mr. Whiskers tells him what he has to do so he doesn't get into trouble. His therapist Dr. Warren (Jacki Weaver) tries to help and get him to take his medication, but he has to face reality if he does that and his reality is much worse than he realizes.If you've listened to me before, you'd know that when it comes to horror/comedies I can be quite leery of them. This one actually really works for me. I like how we build the mystery and story of what is going on here. We get subtly introduced that Jerry has mental issues. He isn't very stable and despite how normal he looks, he has issues fitting in. I think that Reynolds ability at comedy plays on that pretty well here.To delve more into this character, we learn through flashbacks and things that he says, his mother was from Germany and she was given an ultimatum by his father to stay there or come with him. This caused her to breakdown mentally to where she self-harmed himself and forced a young Jerry to do something traumatic. Now that he's out of the hospital and trying to live a normal life, there's an interesting commentary on medication and something that seems quite real why some people don't take it. He doesn't feel like himself, he never really had any friends so by taking his medication he would lose the voices he's projecting that are his animals. It is kind of heartbreaking to be honest.I also feel bad for him in that being that he's socially awkward, he doesn't realize that Fiona isn't really interested in him or that Lisa is really interested in him. It does take some time to come to terms with the latter, in that Lisa is better for him and it really builds to what happens in the end even more to make it such a stronger fall from grace and much more impactful. There's also an interesting commentary about religion here, being that this is in the town of Milton, Jerry calls Fiona an angel at one point and we see her that. Plus he's asking about the angels from the bible who all have names and there's a hint to the end of the joke through the name of the town and their most famous work.It seems like next I should shift over to talking about the acting. If you couldn't tell, I think that the acting for this is pretty strong. I thought Reynolds does a great job at being this awkward guy who is good looking, but is so messed up from his past. This makes an intriguing look at nature vs. nurture. There's a history of mental illness here so he definitely has the genetics not being in his favor. Going even farther though, there's a traumatic event that happens to him that sends him over the edge. I'm so glad the choice was made to have him doing all of the voices, as he realizes they're all from his head so it should be a variation of his voice. The Scottish one though had me losing it as I'm a big fan of Mr. Whiskers. I thought that Arterton was solid as the English lady he's in love with, but she's low key mean to him. He doesn't realize though which makes it worse. I found Kendrick to be adorable and she is such a good character here. It really helps to build the impact of it as well. I also thought that Weaver, Ella Smith, Chadhidi and the rest did well for what was needed.That will take me to the pacing, which I thought was fine. You don't see a lot of horror comedies that run as long as this one does. This comes in at 103 minutes, but it really didn't feel like it. There was a point where something happened that I wasn't sure how they were going to continue and I actually liked where it went. I do think it could have been trimmed a bit. I'm not taking any points off though as I never was bored and I liked where it ended up. The ending credit sequence was quite odd and actually made me happy in an odd way if you really think about it.Moving to the effects of this movie, I thought they were well done. The blood looked real as well as the bit of gore that we get. There are actually a lot of subtle things that are done though as well. The way that Jerry sees his life is different when he's on and off his medications. I like getting these glimpses as it makes this so much better overall for me. There is a bit of CGI when it comes to making the animals talk. I don't hate it as it worked and since this from the mind of a sick man, I'm more forgiving. I would say that the cinematography was solid as well.Now with that said, I ended up really digging this movie. For being a horror comedy, it really explores things much deeper than I was expecting. The depth of Jerry was quite interesting to me while looking at his mental illness. Him wanting to fit in and just find his place is sad with how things that turn out. The acting really brought this to life. It does run a bit long, but I was there for the ride for sure. The effects were really good across the board, going more practical than CGI, but I didn't have an issue with either. I thought this was shot well overall and the soundtrack wasn't my favorite. It fit the tone for the movie though. My rating here would be that this was a good movie for sure and would recommend giving this a viewing."
" DONT believe fake reviews..
",0.3724,0.4299,2020-02-01 00:00:00,1,"I like comedies. I like scary flicks. This film tries to combine them both and it's simply awful. This is one of those movies when you watch it you will want to stop the movie and regret not stopping it. The serial killer keeps human heads in his refrigerator. Apparently, it's funny that he talks to the heads and has a relationship with them. It's not funny and its disturbing that the author thought things like this carry a comedic affect. I didn't come close to laughing in the movie."

" Absolutely bonkers, just how I like my comedies
",0.6369,0.9264,2019-12-29 00:00:00,7,"'The Voices' is a light-hearted black comedy designed to appeal to people who enjoy ridiculous, nonsensical, barking mad (excuse the pun) films that are so stupid they're funny. I'm absolutely one of those people and I thought this film was great - definitely one of the best black comedies I've watched in a long time.Unless I'm mistaken, this is the first Ryan Reynolds comedy I've seen other than the Deadpool films, which I didn't like at all. Any doubts I had though quickly went away as he was very funny in this film and worked well with the jokes and content.I don't know what it is about absurd, 'out there' comedies that appeals to me, but 'The Voices' was right up my street. Maybe I'm just immature. Whatever it is, I enjoyed this film."

He's in therapy and it's a study on that. Ryan is trying to give a good performance, but the director is not letting him. It's that type of movie.Some interesting stuff is done here. Nothing too cool. Reynolds annoys me once again.See it if you want"

Very dark, but unusually lighthearted at the same time. It's crazy that Jerry was so crazy and psychotic, but because of Reynolds great acting, the character was still very likeable, even when he was chopping people (who didn't deserve to die) to bits. When things go bad for Jerry, you sympathize with him, even though he's a maniac. Speaking of maniac, this movie kinda reminded me of a comedic version of Maniac. The dog and cat were very funny, and the movie was filled with great humor. Had a very stupid, but hysterical ending."
" The voices

" Quirky things-go-horribly-wrong movie
",0.0,0.9413,2019-10-31 00:00:00,7,"2014 was also the year that Miss Meadows appeared. Both that movie and The Voices are similar in their approaches, as each begins with a premise of innocence which is gradually eroded. Both rely on the performance and charm of the lead. Ryan Reynolds does a good job as the helpful childlike employee, reminding me a little of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, though with less exuberance and ultimately far less gravity. The Voices is an easy movie to watch, the story is relatively uncomplicated, and early on the lead is very likeable and you want him to do alright. When it comes undone you hope he'll find a way out. I think it says a lot about how the mentally ill are far less responsible for crimes than the rest of us.Just a side note about Miss Meadows: Initially I struggled to remember the name of that movie. Had I not recalled that there was a ""Miss"" in the title I would never have found it, despite describing both the plot and the dvd cover in detail at several search sites. If ever you find you really like a 'lesser' movie (ie, not a blockbuster), then my suggestion is that you make a quick note of it, because if you forget the title you may well be in for a very frustrating time indeed."

" Good and bad
",-0.1531,-0.9794,2019-06-23 00:00:00,8,"This film is a surprisingly accurate portrayal of someone who experiences voices and unusual beliefs. But it's disappointing that it portrays people with mental health problems going on to murder people. Having worked with people who live with the conditions shown (schizophrenia, dissociative identity, depression) they're more often a threat to themselves. The scarier people I've worked with, who've never been diagnosed with anything, have been the ones who've committed vicious murders. But ryan Reynolds is excellent in his portrayal, particularly as he played the voices of the animals. The part where he starts taking his meds and can see life as it actually is was very poignant. Many of the guys I work with say they miss their voices and unusual beliefs, as they've helped them with some really tough parts of their lives, but they're (rightfully?) forced to take their meds. It was a funny, sad and acerbic film and I thought it really went under the radar when it came out."
" Pet Sounds
",0.0,-0.9843,2019-06-23 00:00:00,6,The Voices is a black comedy/horror film about mental illness and not taking your medication.Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) is an upbeat nerdy guy working at a factory in a small town. He has had disturbing issues in his childhood. He needs to see a psychiatrist Dr Warren (Jacki Weaver) and take his medication. Failure to do so is a breach of his release orders.As Jerry is not taking his medication he can hear voices from his pets. Mr Whiskers the sinister cat and Bosco his docile dog. When Jerry takes an English expat Fiona (Gemma Arterton) to dinner he accidentally runs over a deer and then accidentally kills Fiona.Unfortunately Jerry cuts up her body and puts her head in the fridge. Jerry hallucinates Fiona's head talking to him and she demands a companion in the fridge. Now Jerry has an eye on Lisa (Anna Kendrick) who has a crush on Gerry. Pretty soon the heads in the fridge mount up.Jerry mostly sees the world in a demented clinical way. Bosco acts as his conscious. It is only when Jerry takes his pills that he sees his scuzzy blood soaked flat with rotting flesh.The Voices is a grotesque offbeat dark comedy/horror hybrid. Reynolds cannot pull of being the weird nerdy guy convincingly. He also provides the voices of his pets. He actually does a good Scots accent.The film tries too hard to be quirky and I thought it had an unsatisfying conclusion. I also found the violence misogynistic. All the violence is against women. It did at least provide an insightful look at a possible outlook of a serial killer.
" What the......
",0.0,-0.9253,2019-06-21 00:00:00,1,"Okay, I give in. What was Ryan Reynolds thinking when he signed up for this lemon? This film is absolute garbage. A guy talks to his cat and dog, who talk back, dismembers women for no clearly discernible reason and puts their heads in his refrigerator. That makes sense .... actually, no it doesn't! Is this a horror film? Well, it makes no attempt to shock or terrify, so that's a no. Is it a comedy? It that was the intention, it didn't just miss the bulls-eye, it missed the entire dart board! At the risk of repeating myself, this film is drivel - avoid it, your time would be better spent watching paint dry!"

It gets very (very, very) dark but is incredibly fascinating and believable in its portrayal of the ill mind and distorted perspective of a very troubled man. The writing, acting, directing, production, and cinematography are 👌🏾👌🏾 all superb. And this is quite possibly Reynolds' best performance (or at least of what I've seen of him) yet -- Oscar-worthy. If you can go into this film with a very open mind, I highly recommend it. It's sad and interesting and weird and somewhat humorous and eerie and shocking and tragic and thought-provoking all at the same time."

" Heavily underrated movie
",0.0,0.9938,2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"First thing I'd like to say is that this movie is telling nothing but the personal story of Jerry. Not the life of a serial killer, not the life of a crazy dude gone nuts, no, the story of Jerry's character. And this story isn't a horror movie, not a thriller, not a frucking comedy, it's a full on drama. This movie is SAD. There is NOTHING funny in this, nor is it scary. Unsettling and surprising, yes, but not scary (unless some fake blood is enough to make you tremble, then yes, it's scary). Jerry's character is wonderfully complex, his story, masterfully revealed, bit by bit, is compelling to no end and you genuinely want to love that boy. Like really, he needs some love. But while the writing of this movie is as good as it can be, this film really shines in its filming and acting. both are on point and flawless, serving the story perfectly and succeeding in making you see the world from Jerry's AND others' eyes at the same time which is definitely a performance. Beyond that there's also the few moments when the film really makes you question things like the benefits of the pills for the patient, judging people without knowing them, or that very intelligently worded subject of what makes us sane or insane in the last dialogue between Jerry and his doctor.
Now I won't go into details as it would take me months to rightfully describe everything good with that movie. What I will say however is that it IS a movie to put on your watchlist and PLEASE don't watch it as a comedy or a horror movie because it is neither. It's just the sad story of Jerry, that boy no one ever understood.A lot of people's reaction to this movie is ""wtf have I just watched"", probably mainly because they went in and watched having in mind the idea that this movie was going to scare them or make them laugh. Please don't make the mistake of expecting anything of the sort, and you won't be disappointed."

There is no doubt that Jerry is bat guano crazy, and he really should be stopped...but you don't want to see him harmed.It's too real and surreal at the same time...and the closing credits are fantastic.I get why people might hate it. It is very polarizing but charming as well. There's no way to properly convey the essence of this movie. You'll just have to see it for yourself.

Ryan's performance completely made this movie and he brought so much appeal to it, and that's all that matters. And to top it all off....the most bizarre part of this movie was the dance scene at the end. It brought an almost unbearable psychotic creepiness to the already gut wrenching weirdness that it was actually hard to take.

Ryan Reynolds plays our anti-hero who is a warehouse schlub working in the packing department but not really connecting to anyone. Once going cold turkey from his medication, he tries hard connecting with any girl that'll have him but the end results are usually disastrous. Shot w/a candy colored vision of dreams run amok, this film could've gone anywhere instead of the obvious murderous rampage we end up in.

It looked kinda silly and dumb but what the heck it had Ryan Reynolds in it so I gave it a watch on Netflix and I was completely blown away. Not only does Reynolds put on an amazing and at times heartbreaking performance, but he's also frickin hilarious. Most dark comedies only get one of the parts right, dark or comedy. But ""The Voices"" felt that it had managed to blend the two perfectly. And it knew when it was appropriate to be funny and when it needed to take itself seriously. The dialogue is both hilariously and realisitically awkward and as someone who has mental health issues (although not to the extent of Reynolds' character) I can honestly say that this movie represented the struggles of therapy, taking your medicine, and balancing the voices in your head perfectly. I will say that this movie is not for everyone, you're either going to go ""meh"" or absolutely love it."

While in ""Captive"" he seems to be doing almost nothing and is disguised behind a full beard, Reynolds reverts to his boy-next-door appearance in ""The Voices"", and switches effortlessly from comedy into tragedy, or rather: he underplays comedy and turns it into tragedy - a very, very hard thing to do, and he comes through with flying colours. One scene deserves a special mention. His reaction to the two-minute psycho-analysis delivered by his therapist who is talking for dear life while tied up on the hood of his car; serial killer Jerry's cathartic moment. It is absolutely priceless.
Of course, Reynolds is greatly assisted by a great script and a wonderful cast. Even the animals are good. The film as such is a gem, and the Bollywood-like ending is reminiscent of Dennis Potter's very sombre depression-era jukebox musical ""Pennies from Heaven""."

You feel bad that he's doing those things but almost not really for the victim but for him because you know what doing those things is doing to him as well. 
This just really hit all the buttons I like in a movie like this. I'm extremely impressed with all the voices Ryan does (I didn't realize it was him because it truly sounds nothing like him at all). Ryan did fantastic in this movie, he was awkward, charming, funny, embarrassing, scary, intense, sad, etc. he did it all and did it very well. 
The director did a fantastic job with the whole thing, I really also liked the scene where our perception of the world shifts with Jerry's and we see the horror he's really living. It was definitely unique to me and I liked that insight going forward for the rest of the movie. It also makes you question his perception of the fact that his kills were ""accidents"" - was that true or is that how he's able to justify himself? Great movie, I continually watch it, and I completely recommend it to everyone. So good!!"
" Weird way to abord madness

" This is the movie that made Ryan Reynolds one of my favorite actors
",0.4588,0.9842,2018-05-29 00:00:00,10,"Ryan Reynolds is best known for playing the pretty boy in various Rom-Com-Movies. The good looking guy who falls in love with a good looking girl after going through a lot of trouble. Sometimes funny, sometimes romantic. But this movie gave him the chance to show a wider range of acting. Playing a psychopath is probably the most challenging role for an actor. But Reynolds did a great job in this movie playing a very strange character, that gets all your sympathy although doing terrible things. I've never felt more sympathy for a psychopath than in this movie. And his female victims (Gemma Arterton and Anna Kendick) make it even better. Very strange movie, but I love it!"
" Mr. Whiskers Nailed It
",0.0,-0.9398,2018-05-25 00:00:00,2,"If this review was just about Mr. Whiskers, I'd give it a 10. Sadly, it isn't.I love Ryan Reynolds, so when I came across this, I thought: ""Yeay! A Deadpool-like movie."" Trust me; it is not. I also LOVE ""dark"" humor, sarcasm, double-entendre, dry wit ... (you get the picture), so after watching this, I had to really ask myself why it was that I found it so horrifying. All I could come up with is that maybe I wasn't expecting, going in, how dark a dark-comedy this really is. Even towards the end, I kept thinking there was a twist coming that would make it not quite so dark. As such, to me, it was an assault on what I deem to be my not-so-thin-skinned sensibilities. I may be the only one, but I hated it."
" Not funny
",-0.3412,0.0929,2018-05-16 00:00:00,4,"Not funny, and not serious enough to be scary. So lost in the middle. Waste of talent. I kept thinking it would go to a Monty Python type satire but never got there. Dexter was way better at the genre."
" An underrated gem
",0.0,0.9438,2018-04-23 00:00:00,9,"A really well-made dark comedy, this film takes a candid look at mental illness. It's scary how real it is sometimes, in its mundane details and in its stark insights .It gets into some pretty dark stuff, but never loses its easy-breezy tone. Ryan Reynolds is truly a fine actor, his performance is always just right. It's even more impressive once you know he did the voices for the animals as well."
" Tonal irregularities
",0.0,-0.9052,2018-03-30 00:00:00,6,"""The Voices"" is an odd horror-comedy type thing that isn't scary or funny or thrilling or much of anything. It's the fairly typical story about a boy-next-door who is also a mentally unstable killer. He has a crush on a beautiful office employee, played by Gemma Arterton, though another employee - Anna Kendrick - has a crush on him. His pets talk to him - a dog and a cat - and his psychiatrist, played by legendary Australian actress Jacki Weaver, has prescribed him antipsychotic medication that he refuses to take.You know that somebody's going to get killed, and then someone will find out who killed who and also get killed, and the body count will rise. The movie takes an ironic, light-hearted tone in regards to this activity; it's not a horror movie or even a thriller, really. It's also not funny at all, unless you think the sight of a talking dog and cat is amusing by default. The cat swears a fair bit, so some people might be amused by that, I guess.What is uncomfortable and unnecessary is that the movie adds a troubling backstory for the Ryan Reynolds character which doesn't fit at all with the silly tone of the movie. This is an explanation for his insanity that would fit in a gritty true-crime pic, not a deliberately ridiculous horror-comedy.The climax is also just not that interesting. It's quite predictable, like the rest of the movie, and I think they should have added something unexpected or interesting in there - aside from the awful song-and-dance number over the end credits.I'm not really sure what the makers of ""The Voices"" wanted to achieve with this movie. It gives the impression that they didn't know how to handle the light-hearted tone, or what the purpose of such a tone in a story like this is. The tone needs to clash with the content, but here they're both flat, they lie down and die, which is almost what the movie made me feel like doing."

" It isn't really fun to laugh at schizophrenia anymore...
",0.237,-0.8657,2018-03-10 00:00:00,3,"I love a good dark comedy and so I was on board when I read the premise of Ryan Reynolds talking to his cat and dog about whether or not to be a serial killer. The premise works best as a dark comedy but the movie gets really depressing as it goes a lot into the character's actual suffering with schizophrenia. It becomes at different times a drama, a grisly horror film, and a cartoony surreal fantasy. I don't know. This is a really hard sell. I guess I can appreciate it's honesty in actually acknowledging schizophrenia and mental health problems but then they've sort of shot themselves in the foot as it cannot work then as a dark comedy. I don't want to laugh at schizophrenic hallucinations being portrayed as a cartoon in one scene and then seeing Reynolds with his therapist in agony in another. I think what the film should have done is start off with the comedic effect and then have it wear off as it goes into the seriousness of the situation. It doesn't. The film ends with a big dance number where Reynolds dances with Jesus and his victims."
" A unique black comedy that balances total silliness with proper darkness.
",-0.1027,-0.0534,2018-03-05 00:00:00,7,"'The Voices (2015)' is a black comedy of the darkest proportions, walking on a razor-sharp tightrope where even the slightest breeze could mean the difference between total silliness and utter seriousness in a way which makes the opposite elements stick out like sore, misshapen and misjudged thumbs. Thankfully, the piece manages to pull its contrasting elements together remarkably well without pulling any punches or picking the wrong moments to place an ill-informed gag, aside from the finale dance number which comes out of left field and feels much sillier in tone than anything preceding it. It's an odd flick to get on board with, though, and surely won't be for everyone. 7/10"

It is a movie about a serial-killer, but it is not dark or brooding for the most part, it is colourful and cheery, it is full of pink and fluffiness, it has a ""talking cat, dog, goldfish, and another, it is full of happiness and light, so much so that you could think that I was talking about a film of a man finishing off his breakfast, but no, we are not talking about a cereal-killer here!
There are many ways this film stands out from the rest, from its story to its direction, to its, well, everything before it.
The performances of Reynolds, Arterton and Kendrick are all fantastic, but the film is made possible by the furry ones, and Reynolds' ability to diversify his voice, and make it believable.
THIS IS A 10/10 FILM, no question, watch it, it will be the first movie about a serial-killer to leave you feeling all warm and fluffy inside!
I just watched it again, and I love the human side of Deadpool."
" Brilliant portrayal
",0.5859,0.9201,2018-02-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a big surprise in many ways.Although I initially thought this was not going to be too interesting and a bit of a superficial storyline, it soon became clear that this was a brilliant production.The portrayal of someone living in a world dominated by hallucinations - disconnected from reality - yet still being able to function in society is superb and (although symbolic) is incredibly accurate to many people's experiences.As the movie progressed I felt myself going from enjoying the fairly light interaction between the characters to becoming sucked in to an increasingly disturbed story."

" very disturbing & horrifying movie
",-0.8211,-0.9253,2017-12-28 00:00:00,7,A sick movie about a man that has a illness to talk to animals and stuff. he takes medicine to help to overcome this & when he doesn't take the regular dosage of medicine he mistakenly kills a girl he likes in his mind he can talk to the head without the body but if he takes the medicine he's ended up with the real fact of a dead woman's head.. yuck. it truly disgusting but can enjoy the movie in the serial killers mind way of seeing things.
" Simplistic and unrealistic.
",0.0,0.0854,2017-12-13 00:00:00,2,This movie had all the right elements on paper but failed to execute many of them well. Look out for Dr. Warren's (Jacki Weaver) monologue towards the end of the film but be prepared to be let down by hammy character acting and a childish plot before you get there.An example of something this film did well was the contrast of perception in Jerry's (Ryan Reynolds) apartment but they could have taken that trope further. I disliked the naive view of Psychology/Medication as it gave the film unrealistic and childish plot progression (it clearly wasn't researched).Overall I wouldn't recommend paying for this movie. Watch it at a friends house or wait for it to come to TV.
" Awkward and not for me... **NO SPOILERS**
",-0.1531,0.8749,2017-11-19 00:00:00,4,"I recognise that this film was an attempt at an original quirky idea, but from the moment the Scottish 'voice' clunked its way in I knew I wasn't feeling it.Respect to Ryan Reynolds for being game for something this different, but I don't feel the gamble paid off in this case.A film such as this is based on the 'idea'. If the idea is strong and executed well you have something amazing (as in Fight Club for instance). The Voices was not that.Film equivalent of a balloon being noisily deflated.A limp noodled 4 out of 10"
" Good thing your pets don't actually talk...
",0.4404,-0.9561,2017-10-19 00:00:00,5,"Ryan Reynolds plays a warehouse worker who has conversations with his cat and his dog. Weird enough on its own, but in this case Reynolds' Jerry is seeing a shrink, is off his meds, and is told to do pretty horrible things by his pets.Jerry a hard worker with a fine reputation, falls for a coworker named Fiona (Emma Arterton). When she stands him up for a date – sort of a miscommunication – tragedy ensues. And then when other coworkers (like Anna Kendrick) enter the mix, more tragedy ensues.The movie's tone shifts an awful lot. Sometimes it's slapstick comedy – look, talking animals using profanity! – but other times it's a pretty serious, deadpan horror movie. I mean, there's a plethora of blood and guts. Think of this as a predecessor of sorts to TV's Dexter. Bodies are chopped up. Jerry's madness is at turns amusing and horrifying.Fun fact: Reynolds himself does the voices of his cat (Mr. Whiskers) and his dog (Bosco) – and they don't sound much like Reynolds' normal voice. Mr. Whiskers appears to be Scottish, and Bosco has a Southern drawl. But as they're both aspects of Jerry's damaged psyche, so there's a little bit of him in there.Jerry's descent into utter madness (juxtaposed with his endless smile and optimism) is fun to watch, and Reynolds does a fine job. He gets some able support from Arterton and Kendrick, too. But it all adds up to a movie that doesn't strike a consistent tone, thus just missing its mark."
" I liked it!
",0.4753,0.9891,2017-10-08 00:00:00,7,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting this movie to be any good based on the trailers. But given the fact that it had a good crew to work with Reynolds, Kendrick etc, I thought I might just give it a chance and I don't regret it a bit!Without giving any spoilers, the movie revolves around a likable guy who just happens to talk to his evil pets. What I found interesting about this is that it's pretty easy to empathize with the main characters because there are a lot of explanations nicely wrapped either through the voice of the main character or sweet memories.I would recommend it to people who like to watch dark comedies and are amused by the weirdness of having a head inside a fridge (without any type of real desire to kill other people of course)!"
" Blame the Cat
",-0.34,0.9865,2017-10-03 00:00:00,7,"Always smiling, upbeat and cheerful, a young factory worker casually hides the fact that he imagines his pets speaking to him; things take a macabre turn though as his spiteful cat leads him astray in this very dark black comedy from Marjane Satrapi, who also helmed the equally fascinating 'Persepolis'. Satrapi includes some great touches, such as contrasting shots of what the protagonist's world looks like when he is on and off medication and the subtle special effects used to make the cat and dog's mouths move makes his one-way conversations with them eerily realistic. The film's best asset though is the casting of Ryan Reynolds in the lead role. It's a performance that has been compared to Anthony Perkins in 'Psycho' with good reason; both are equally boyish, affable characters who we cannot help but sympathise with slightly no matter what they do. The film does, however, walk some very fine lines - not only in terms of good/bad taste, but also the way mental illness is sort of parodied - and it is easy to understand why the film has been less than well-received by some. For those not easily offended and interested in something weird, unusual and daringly different, this is an easy recommendation. It is also a motion picture best entered into with as few expectations as possible since a fair bit of its uncanny nature comes from unexpected directions."
" Added an extra star for the hottie.
",0.0,0.9239,2017-09-24 00:00:00,4,"Strange.. I literally watched this film like a month ago and I can barely remember it. All I remember is what's his name playing a crazy guy and the first girl he is interested in the movie is stacked af. Seriously. She was the main reason kept watching at first. Then I had to finish watching the film because I invested too much time in it by then. Frankly the idea behind the film is sound and holds water but the execution just falls flat and turns the film into nothing but filler. This film had the acting talent, a high budget for an indie but the script was just nothingness behind a good idea. Sometimes having a good idea doesn't work if it isn't done right."
" Offbeat and original
",0.3182,0.9847,2017-09-12 00:00:00,7,"Hmmm, where to start with this one. Apart from the basic plot line, I knew absolutely nothing prior to watching this film and what a nice surprise it turned out to be. This is certainly not for everyone, the comedy in this one is very dark and if you like that you will definitely be enjoying yourself. The film starts off nice and slow and then takes quite a dark turn, well quite a few actually and merges comedy, schizophrenia and bloody violence in a very original way. Acting from Ryan Reynolds is really good as he managed to portray this crazy character in such a way that it is really hard not to like him despite his mind going completely off the rails and him doing horrible things to some really nice people. His cat and dog voices were really funny too.If you like offbeat films, dark humour and original writing, The Voices should be your choice for sure."

I think it's entertaining in a unique way, and it can especially be interesting for cat/dog lovers. Also, it has a very unique style which allows the movie to be funny and scary at the same time. It's definitely worth to watch!"
" Could be better
",0.4404,0.6699,2017-04-11 00:00:00,3,"At the beginning the movie I thought it was gonna go two different ways. Either it's inappropriately hilarious, or it makes the viewer super uncomfortable. Well the movie was both funny and really distressing, but also it turned out to be completely different from what I hoped. and not in a good way. There are many great elements to the story but eventually it just doesn't seem to live up to its potential. The story clearly needs something more, something different, to make it truly great.Also there's the matter of how hurtful this movie is to those who actually suffer from certain mental illnesses where you hear voices. But of course I'm not the judge of that."

" The Voices
",0.0,0.9948,2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"'The Voices' is a very dark comedy from graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi. It tells the story of a man named Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) who works in a bathtub factory. Jerry continuously sees a psychiatrist (Jacki Weaver) as he tries to live a normal life whilst dealing with his mental afflictions. He decides to pursue his office crush (Gemma Arterton) but soon finds himself in a murderous situation when she fails to reciprocate his advances. Jerry's schizophrenia means that he hears voices specifically from his pets who give him help and advice.Satrapi directs the piece with a surprisingly heartfelt and empathetic way. The lack of colour and light (such as when Jerry is on his limiting medication) contrast really well with the scenes where the main character is free and feels at peace. There are very graphic scenes of murder which highlight the brutality of his actions reminding the audience of the morality of Jerry's actions. The music is also very fitting and turns drastically into a horror- themed score when the drama switches.The screenplay is funny in a lot of places. Before I watched the film, I thought I would find similarities with HBO's 'Dexter' as it deals with a likable killer whilst also being humorous. But, after watching, I feel that the film owes a lot to Mary Harron's 'American Psycho' as it shares similar themes of delusion and indulgence. However, the dialogue was a bit forced at times and I usually find myself cringing when watching a British actress (in this case Gemma Arterton) having to read lines written in a very stereotypical way.Ryan Reynolds is fantastic as the main character and really makes the audience feel for his character. Reynolds completely embodies the main character's innocence and is a genuinely nice man. Even more impressive is the fact that Reynolds also performs voices for his pets which include a Scottish cat and a Texan dog. I had a slight problem with other members of the cast who I felt were not quite up to the standard that Reynolds set although Jacki Weaver was great as his psychiatrist and Anna Kendrick did a good job at playing his love interest.Overall, I feel that 'The Voices' was a surprisingly good film. It was funny and very well acted. 'The Voices' is a little hidden gem that a lot of people who are fans of small and strange indie comedies would love. My final rating is 4 stars."
" Pointless
",0.0,-0.9936,2017-02-20 00:00:00,4,"I wanted to like this movie. Ryan Reynolds is usually quite appealing. He is a great actor, but even he couldn't save this pointless film. The premise was interesting and the opening was promising, but the film fell flat for me after Fiona's demise. He was connecting with Lisa, but then she was killed, and Allison soon followed suit. And for what? There's only so much you can get out of hoarding (which, by the way, was never explained), dismembered body parts, and blood and guts smeared everywhere. The talking dog and cat were frankly obnoxious, and the psychiatrist was useless. You know the patient's history and know how important the meds are, and yet you halfheartedly ask him if he is taking them? You note that he appears troubled and do nothing. No follow-through. Why even bother having the character? And I kept waiting for some sort of resolution at the end, but it never happened. He *finally* gets caught at the 11th hour. Okay. You'd think someone might have connected the dots a bit sooner given his obvious feelings for Fiona and his suspicious behavior following her disappearance. Lisa knew how he felt, as did Allison, but no one was concerned? And the cops weren't, either? And at the end, Jerry allowed himself to die, and awoke to a song-and- dance routine with his dead mother and the girls he killed? This was ridiculous, not funny. The film was worthless."
