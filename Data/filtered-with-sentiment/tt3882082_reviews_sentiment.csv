" Unique
",0.0,0.9677,2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,This movie will surprise you. I love it! It's amazing how it's constantly gripping. I enjoy watching it over and over even though I know the end. The plot twists are fantastic and unexpected!!! I highly recommend.
" Really very well written story and wonderfully directed
",0.763,-0.3324,2021-03-18 00:00:00,10,"I don't usually watch English Horror movies, but this one really grabbed my attention and satisfaction, after watching this I really can say this movie is nothing like those traditional Hollywood ""Horror"" movies, where they include bugs n stuff and makes it's loose legitimacy... this one is just the best in horror class."
" Slow paced but awesome
",0.7684,0.9234,2021-03-18 00:00:00,9,"This film was pretty slow paced and could've simply be put into a 20 minute short film but was I dissapointed? Absolutely not! This film was amazing! The story, the twist, the characters! It lacks gore but you don't need gore to make a good movie! Brahms the doll looks unnerving!9/10"
" Original and creepy movie
",0.3182,0.9489,2021-03-15 00:00:00,8,"It's not horrifying, but it doesn't have to be horrifying to be a good movie, i personally think it has an ordinary out of the common. Would definitely recommend"
" Had me going.
",0.0,0.8663,2021-03-08 00:00:00,7,A bit sceptical but was pleasantly surprised. Lauren Cohan held the film well and after 5 minutes forgot she was Maggie. Simple and somewhat a classic ghost story but very creepy at times and some genuine jumps. Liked it.
" Good
",0.4404,0.8874,2021-03-07 00:00:00,6,"Good psychological thriller, with some too-much-easy solutions for ""plot problems"". But good movie, considering the genre, very nice acting, good execution. Not remarkable, but it is above average."
" BEST HORROR DOLL MOVIE EVER!!! VERY UNDERRATED
",0.3348,0.9735,2021-02-11 00:00:00,10,"People who say this and the second movie is bad are smoking baloney!! I love how unique it is in the way that all the other movies make the doll ALL CREEPY LOOKING while this doll gives us thoughts of an innocent boy and makes him look so sweet and it makes us not think bad about the doll at all, its not predictable like Chucky at all and is WAY BETTER THAN CHUCKY!! Brahms is superior in every way, PLEASE SPREAD AND SHARE THIS MOVIE AND ALSO THE SECOND MOVIE!!! ITS NEEDS ALL THE SUPPORT IT CAN GET!! BUY THE MOVIE AND SUPPORT THE SOCIAL MEDIAS OF IT!!! Very underrated!!!!"
" Good boy
",0.4404,0.8442,2021-02-05 00:00:00,6,"Having a catchy title including the definite article can go either way. Some as the village are true milestones. Others are... well not so much. The boy, sits in between I'd say. Right, here we are again: A dark mansion plus a creepy doll... sounds familiar ? well, not really. The movie actually manages to spin its own eerie identity at a tranquil pace. If u are expecting CGI or just another supernatural flick u might skip it , but if u are open for mystery & a proper twist u will be well entertained."
" A Real Horror Movie
",-0.5719,-0.2516,2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"You obviously scared whole movie.Atmosphere, ambiance,mystery and sudden things make you scared and wonder about the film. You think you watch some chicle and you can see what is gonna happen at the end of the movie. BUT no! not like you think or guess... Great and orginal movie."
" Slow but worth it
",0.3291,0.6013,2021-01-14 00:00:00,7,"This thriller has a unique storyline, fantastic acting and a good twist. The first half is fairly slow and so it doesn't drag you in, but the twist makes the movie."
" Movie could have been better if the doll was haunted
",-0.0516,0.3649,2021-01-02 00:00:00,4,Movie is just average. It is interesting till we realize the boy isn't died. I don't understand the logic of why the parents of boy lived with that doll if the boy survived the accident? Why didn't they treat his psychic disorder? There are many questions pending to answer in this movie. I wonder how they get such a big collection!
" Moderately creative thriller, if a bit dull
",0.1531,0.8753,2020-12-29 00:00:00,5,"The Boy is a pretty decent film, it's obviously had a lot of creative thinking behind it and it's a huge shame it never really rises above curious mediocrity. The actual acting is fairly reasonable, especially from Lauren Cohan and Rupert Evans. Plot wise is where it gains the most points for being original and interesting, but also loses some due to the slow development of the plot and overall lack of exciting moments, which is a shame as tension is built up well.The cinematography is good in places and the house is suitably dark, the actual doll is extremely creepy and very well made. It's just a shame we don't altogether see the doll in full action and in my opinion the ending wasn't as well done as I'd hoped for. It all gets a bit weird.5/10: Very creative but overall a bit boring"
" It's a Thriller without logics, Not a horror
",-0.2683,0.7177,2020-12-14 00:00:00,3,"SPOILER ALERT !!All the creepiness and the hype given in the first half of the movie is all dropped on the floor in the second half. And no logics. This is the first time I have seen a couple of people learn about a spirit in the house and are so happy to live by it. No reaction including an initial fear. And the actual story behind it, like some others feel proud of, is not worth of it. For the hype and scariness it started with, is boring in the next half"
" You get what you give
",0.0,0.9022,2020-12-13 00:00:00,5,Homestly she had all the warning in the world to treat the Doll kindly she was paid to do so. Yet literally as soon as the old coiple leave she tosses the little doll around I couldnt finish this movie. I honestly treat everthing with a certian level of respect if she did her job properly i almost garentee this movie would be 5 mins long. ðŸ˜’
" One of my favorite horrors
",-0.1779,-0.2497,2020-11-24 00:00:00,10,"It's just great. Guess I was expecting the actual doll to be alive and creepy, but it was pretty cool to discover that the movie didn't rely on that kind of cliche stupidities, but gave us a living, breathing villain instead. I think Brams started to love her and just didn't want to be left alone again, but he was really creepy at the same time, which is why he never quite got his wish. It's a little sad, I feel a tidbit bad for him because he doesn't seem utterly evil at all. Just a man with some crazy dangerous, deep issues."
" Awful
",-0.4588,-0.5499,2020-11-22 00:00:00,1,What an awful ending to a movie. Wish I could get back the time I spent watching this. Waste of time.
" Viewed this as a Comedy instead of a Horror
",-0.296,0.2732,2020-11-21 00:00:00,2,"I found this movie to make absolute 0 sense. Even when everything was ""explained"" it still didn't add up. The whole movie was dumb and the plot was ridiculous. That being said it was fun to watch to laugh at."
" Spoiler, WTF! Its not the worst movie but i rent it on demand and paying for it. NO
",-0.7623,-0.9791,2020-11-20 00:00:00,5,"It was between a 5-6, an okay movie. But one thing was when the American Ex comes why not call the police. Breaking and entering,
Then the walls if they where so bad that you jump threw them, if you fell against them they would make a hole. Thats a small thing. Why would the parents give up then and why have the doll??? Because of course they knew about that the real guy lived in the attic because first they closed the door in the begining to see what the ""doll"" if shes good as a caretaker then they write a letter to the son, write ""from mom and daddy""!. Then when there driving away way wouldnÂ´t they tell the police then, the dead ex plus that he survied from being stabbad in the guts or stomch or lungs, you will died painfully! If your are not very very luck.
WAIT UNTIL IT COMES OUT ON TV!"
" Don't read the cast and crew before seeing this
",0.0,-0.4751,2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,Spoiler alert in the IMDb cast credits. Otherwise this film is not gory but great
" Had low expectations for this film
",-0.2732,-0.9054,2020-10-30 00:00:00,4,"During the COVID 19 pandemic, many people are using streaming services such as Netflix to watch movies since the theaters are all closed. I took to Netflix and decided to watch 2016's The Boy. I somewhat remember seeing the trailer for this film and had low expectations for this film. I just saw it as another haunted doll movie much like the Annabelle movies (of which I have only seen the first film). The film itself was directed by William Brent Bell who apparently from what I have heard, directed films that were pieces of crap and people who really hated those early films have said The Boy is one of the better ones. The film stars Lauren Cohan who is most well known for her role in The Walking Dead. The film itself did alright at the box office and critics and audiences were not entirely impressed with the film. But there are people out there that actually praise this film (not too highly though).We meet Greta who has been hired as a nanny by an elderly couple. A nanny to who you may ask? A doll named Brahms. Apparently the doll is a way for the elderly couple to grief over the death of their son who died 20 years before. When the elderly couple leaves, Greta is left alone. Or is she????????Well, I had low expectations going into this film and.........that is about it. This film when it gets to a certain point, could really go anywhere in terms of story. I went into this film thinking that I was going to be watching one type of film and it ended up being a different type of film altogether and I can't really explain much more without giving out any spoilers. But lets hust say that I was not a huge fan of what the film ended up being. Sure, I came into this film thinking it was going to be one type of film with that type of film being unoriginal. The film ended up being a type of film that with the previous elements already in the film, just made me scratch my head. There is a bit in the middle of the film where it makes it feel like another type of film which is the type that I was a bigger fan of and would have liked to see that part be used for the rest of the film. I was more invested in the middle of the film than in the beginning or end. (Hopefully all of that makes sense. Just try to keep in mind that I am trying to write a spoiler free review and this film is fairly hard to write a spoiler free review of). Plus, I do not understand how a sequel could be successfully made (and a sequel was made but sucked). The film is one of those PG-13 horror films that are not in the least bit scary. There are two instances where I actually was scared but was largely dissappointed by them being one of those dream sequence fakeout scenes. The acting overall is largely mediocre with Lauren Cohan giving a decent performance. Another thing is that I found myself having a hard time listening to the dialouge in this film. I turned my TV up to a serviceable volume for what I usually watch and I still had a hard time listening and I am very convinced that it is the movies problem because everything else in the film is of normal volume. So, I most likely missed out on some key details in conversations that occured so it is no wonder I had scratched my head for a few instances (but not for the ending though). The one thing that I think this film does fairly well is developing an atmosphere. If you take a look of the house that this film takes place in, it looks like a place that would be haunted. It is a dark, stone building. No flowers to decorate it or anything. The inside is old and a little creepy as well. Even the doll can be said to be fairly creepy at times as well.I honestly had low expectations for this film and that is pretty much what I got for the most part. The Boy could have went anywhere in terms of story and ended up having the film switch from one type of story over to another (and more) silly type of film. It does have nice atmosphere and I will give it that. It might not have been my type of film, but I suppose someone out there would enjoy this film."
" Bad Decisions All Around
",-0.5423,-0.9825,2020-10-25 00:00:00,1,"This is such a bad movie. In truth I only picked this one to watch because it's too late at night for me to comfortably watch Hereditary and still sleep. So... creepy doll movie by default. There were a few loud noise jump scares here and there but if you're like me and you don't find dolls that scary this movie will be low on the fear factor. I know most horror movie characters make bad decisions but the ones in this movie are particularly bad! The mean ex boyfriend was badly acted and honestly, asking a ""possessed"" doll to take care of him for you?? That was one of the decisions that put me over the edge. I at least will sleep soundly at night, having no worries about little dolls coming to get me. Honestly, what's the worry? Just yeet him across the room and gtf out of there. Really it's quite simple."
" An at times genuinely creepy film that turns into a more standard slasher in the second half
",0.0,-0.9079,2020-10-19 00:00:00,5,"Escaping from an abusive relationship in the US, Greta (Lauren Cohan) takes on the job of nanny at an English country mansion. The parents (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) are about to go on vacation and leave the nanny in charge of their son who turns out to be a porcelain ventroliquist like dummy. Once she has overcome the shock and was not a joke, when she ignores the strict rules she notices things go bump in the night and her clothes begin to disappear.A good ol' classic gothic oddity horror that sometimes has a genuine sense of frisson which outshines some ropey acting and dialogue. The second half of the film totally shifts gear into an almost different film, becoming a little more like a stalk and slash horror. It was followed by another sequel, BRAHMS: THE BOY II in 2020 and again changed direction. Filmed in Canada."
" Pleasantly surprising
",0.6369,0.1635,2020-10-17 00:00:00,7,"This starts out seeming like a fairly standard haunted creepy doll story, but there is more to this than meets the eye. Sure, it's not going to win any Oscars, but it is well-acted, atmospheric, and is full of real surprises, rather than just jump scares. An enjoyable quick flick."
" Well that took a twist
",0.2732,0.8987,2020-10-17 00:00:00,8,"Surprisingly good. I was not expecting that considering I've always thought lowly of doll movies. This one had a odd twist which made it super good. Also, surprisingly a little scary. Definitely a movie you should watch, you will not waste time!"
" One of the best horror movies IÂ´ve seen
",0.128,0.8493,2020-10-16 00:00:00,9,"This is for sure one of the most intelligent and best written horror movies I have ever seen. Entertaining, smart, with pretty unexpected plot twists and characters created and performed in perfect accordance with the plot. Besides that, Lauren Cohan not only gives a great performance, but also looks prettiest and sexiest as ever.
I really donÂ´t understand why the movie got only a 6. Probably people just didnÂ´t like it because they didnÂ´t see it coming; and humans, vain and petty as we are, hold grudges on everything that makes feel stupid.
Some reviews mention plot holes... Well, thatÂ´s what everybody says when they really donÂ´t have anything to say."
" Not bad for the Genre
",0.431,0.1779,2020-10-15 00:00:00,7,"Creepy doll inside a creepy house makes for a creepy movie. Not a whole else goes on other than making Greta the nanny (Lauren Cohan), and the delivery guy believe that this doll is actually alive. The audience is taken for the ride as well, leading us to believe this is a typical ghost story. But boy were we wrong.Fairly average horror/thriller film, but with a decent twist at the end it gets the 7 nod from me."
" Entertaining With a Great Final Act
",0.7906,-0.25,2020-10-14 00:00:00,7,"A nanny is hired to take care of an elderly couple's doll and, after they leave, she starts thinking the doll might be alive and has to get to the bottom of things before she becomes another victim of said doll.The Boy starts out as your typical haunted house/creepy doll movie, but by the final act, it morphs into something else entirely and, depending on your opinion, either elevates it or ruins it. For me, it elevated it and took me by surprise."
" The twist isn't the problem
",0.3089,0.126,2020-10-05 00:00:00,3,"I have seen some people dismissing this movie for the twist it has near its conclusion: Personally I think said twist was actually kinda clever. However, the movie itself isn't very interesting, being quite dull.Not as dull as those Paranormal Activty films where almost nothing happens, but it was pretty boring for the mot part, and the clever twist isn't strong enough to carry the whole movie by itself."
" Magnificently Terrifying
",0.1779,-0.1045,2020-10-04 00:00:00,9,If you are looking for a movie that will make you pee your pants more than once then look no further. Half way through the film I was ready to throw away half of my children's toys and had turned on every light in the house. I launched the poor cat off of my lap half a dozen times because I was having involuntary urges to cover my face and curse to protect myself from what I was watching. Highly recommend this film.
" Not Bad, A Fun little Creepy flick
",0.0382,0.991,2020-09-25 00:00:00,8,"Although The Boy is a bit predictable at times, it has plenty of twists and entertaining moments to spare, even with more than a few flaws up its sleeve. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an enjoyable little horror romp, that is luckily very unique and original- rather than a copy off of the so many other doll horror movies we still see today. It has its formulaic moments throughout, even some eye-roll worthy ones as well, but luckily the film is able to pull together with a more than entertaining story to follow- and some wonderfully creepy antics. The performance from the lead isn't anything too special, really just a pretty face to cast in the lead horror role. However, Rupert Evans does give a rather good performance in his role as Malcolm, as well as Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle as Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire, although they are hardly in the film as much in comparison. In the end, The Boy is about as good as you would expect it to be, without ever being exactly what you expected. It's an odd, enjoyable, and rather fun little creepy film, and though it is far from perfect- I wouldn't mind catching it again sometime.
My Rating: 8.25/10"
" Nice alternative of Annab... Wait, no! Better?
",0.5848,-0.6667,2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"Found through Lauren Cohan I first saw in disappointing Mile 22, I was intrigued by the trailer although I don't like dull-doll movies.It is not a rollercoaster, but a seemingly tranquil mystery movie which knows how to increasingly keep our interest.Keep away from any spoilers. Boy 2 doesn't seem a good idea though, since I think the 1st said it all"
" Another impressive horror involving a doll
",-0.1027,0.3612,2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,"The Boy is good surprise horror, with twists and scares aplenty. It's hard to give too many points for originality as this is two solid ideas, but neither is something not seen before. The combination of those two ideas, however, is certainly a fresh take. This one should please most horror fans."
" Keeps you gripped with a few twists
",0.0,0.8758,2020-08-20 00:00:00,7,"*NON-SPOILER*First of all, I have to say that Lauren Cohen plays a great role here as Greta Evans, (the American nanny) who has the job of looking after Brahms (the doll) in a creepy castle-like house in England. As soon as Greta arrives it's clear that the way the owners treat Brahms is a little odd to say the least.
As for the adventure itself, it's twisty, creepy, tense and has you questioning what is before your eyes.
I won't say anymore as I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but definitely worth a watch!"
" I'm pretty sure these Reviews are from Fanboys
",0.6705,0.8653,2020-07-27 00:00:00,4,"Do not believe the good reviews, this movie is literally 2 separate movies crammed together. The 2/3 - 3/4 of the movie is very suspenseful, decently put together & genuinely interesting. The remaining portion goes out if its way to destroy the entire feel, mood, and plausibility that was initially setup. Not only that, but the ""twist"" is cliche & has been done by at least 2 other movies extremely well (The Pact & Housebound). I saw it free on Netflix. That's about as much as an investment as I'd recommend."
" Everything You Think You Know Gets Thrown Out the Window
",0.0,-0.5994,2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,To make a review short and simple: most of the movie plays out as a lifelike doll that appears to be alive. About the 10-15 minutes turns about to Brahms was alive the entire time. He killed a girl during his birthday party. So the parents make up a story that Brahms died in a fire to cover up what their son did. It's a slow burn ghost story that turns into something much different. Stay with it.
" Follow the rules and you'll be fine

",0.0,0.9571,2020-07-09 00:00:00,10,It has an amazing ending. Truly original. It will keep you guessing. Great acting.I'm sure it will gain a cult following && be deemed a cult classic in years to come.
" Decent movie
",0.0,0.4854,2020-07-01 00:00:00,7,"It's a pretty generic horror flick, but it gets a decent amount of tension out of its outlandish premise. Maggie really sells the whole thing. The end was a nice surprise."
" Contradicting feelings
",-0.3182,0.3043,2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"The movie's twist at the end brings you out of the comfort zone of scary movies in the sense that after getting you in the mood for a possessed doll gives a more realistic explanation. Therefore the first reaction is to trigger multiple questions which are not answered with rationalism....However, after a second thought I admit that it was a daring attempt for something different which provides you with an unexpected closure. Most of the movie was making a very well atmosphere for a scary movie where I have to give some extrapoints to videography and cinematics which didn't exaggerate. Acting was more than average and my opinion is that it's above the average of this kind of movies that are directed in the recent years."
" Creepy with an unexpected twist
",0.0,0.8897,2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,I thought this one was far better than ANNABELLE. Really solid storyline and the lead actress was great. Not sure why it had so many negative reviews; a solid plot with an unexpected twist at the end. Definitely give it a chance. Well worth it.
" A waste of a good story
",0.0258,0.7089,2020-06-14 00:00:00,5,"The movie is somehow entertaining and it has a very interesting twist towards the end. However, it is incredibly cliche and it has way too many plot holes. It is very flawed."
" Not your typical horror
",0.4585,0.9828,2020-06-13 00:00:00,9,"I recently watched this again and it reminded me how great this horror is. It has its cliches and couple of jumpscares like any other horror but has originality with the plot and even with little cast they bring pretty good acting in it, even Brahms lmao. I really liked the doll's design, its simple but really creepy!
The thrilling build up is good, and you think you know what will happen in the end or what is the mystery - I swear you do not see the twist coming in the end! It still surprised me even I had seen this movie before."
" Strange yet entertaining
",0.2732,0.9556,2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"I found this movie to be very enjoyable. It wasn't hard to predict the ending and even though i predicted it, it was still a good ending. I also want to say that i like how original this script was. When i read the summary for this movie i assumed it would be a rip off of Chucky but it wasn't. There was some really good acting in this movie too. I very much admired how the leading lady was able to act very genuine in her role for this film. I am a die hard horror fanatic so when i say that this movie impressed me, that's saying a lot. There's not a huge amount of blood or teens being slaughtered mercilessly by some monster or twisted, mutated bodies laying everywhere, but it is very creepy and thrilling psycologically. Definitely recommend."
" Worthwhile thriller

" Surprisingly Watchable
",0.296,0.6476,2020-05-29 00:00:00,5,I didn't have a lot of expectations going into The Boy.I thought it was just going to be the run of the mill possessed doll story. And I was completely on board with the doll being possessed by the little boy and having some kind of exorcism situation.But that twist definitely grabbed my attention and made the movie a whole lot more watchable.When Brahms comes crashing through the wall I nearly lost my mind. Certainly unexpected!Thinking about this movie as a whole I don't think it's that bad of a story and I would recommend watching it at least once if these are the types of movies you enjoy.
" Gave the film a second chance and loved it...
",0.7096,0.7412,2020-05-22 00:00:00,8,"The first time I started to watch this movie, I stopped 2/3 of the way in. I just couldn't believe the ""doll"" was found to be ""real"" and I turned it off.
So, the second time I watched it (last night), I actually finished it and realized that I never had gotten to the end the first time! It was actually creepy (I'm constantly challenging movies to creep me out, and it's pretty hard to do), and the storyline came together way better than I originally anticipated! Need a ""Boy 2""!"
" The ending ruined everything
",-0.4767,-0.6395,2020-05-21 00:00:00,4,"Not a pure horror movie, it is a just psychological thriller.
Through the whole movie they make you believe there is an evil entity or Presence of something demonic and in the end it was just a psycho to explain all the occurrences. Didn't like it and don't recommend it."
" The doll is idealistic... The grown boy is a mess.
",-0.3612,0.8873,2020-05-06 00:00:00,6,"Moodily filmed without a ton of exposition, THE BOY entrances viewers with a life-size doll embodying the spirit of a child who died years before-- his rich parents cling to memories and coddle the doll as if it were a real kid. Yes, Lauren Cohen as nanny does a fine job joking along with the job until it becomes obvious that either the doll walks and plays tricks, or the actual son is still alive and living in the walls of the parents' mansion. Spoiler alert: the latter turns out to be true. Enter a brutish ex-boyfriend and a nerdy grocery-getter and you're in for a predictable yet thrilling climax. What is interesting, is the doll embodies the essence of a true character-- the sweating hairy psycho who's been hiding within the mansion's walls terrorizing people is less a man than a plot device, without any backstory or personality. I guess a sequel is now available? Maybe it has flashbacks. to explain? The theme of this movie puts illusion ahead of facts. It also makes men look kinda sick after puberty."
" Suitable for people who do not watch horror movies regularly.
",0.4585,0.6238,2020-04-25 00:00:00,6,"A softer version of the movie ""Anabelle"". It is thrilling and you feel the tension but it deffinetely is not as good as Anabelle. The first parts of the movie were easy to guess and you kind of knew what was happening and what would happen next but as the movie went on and it came closer to the ending it was almost impossible to guess and you as the crowd will be shocked of whats happening. There will be the ""aha"" moment you will face in the movie. The movie had only one jumpscare which I adore."

",-0.2023,0.3816,2020-04-05 00:00:00,5,The movie really picks up in the 2nd half and uses the first half to build from. It's not full blown horror but it should creep you out. It can be predictable and slow pace but does have a thriller element to it. It has enough to keep you guessing and you more than likely find it a decent watch.
" An unpredictable and underrated film.
",0.0,0.8979,2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"The Boy is a 2016 horror film directed by William Brent Bell and written by Stacey Menear. The film stars Lauren Cohan and Rupert Evans. It is an international co-production between China and the United States. Filming began on March 10, 2015, in Victoria, British Columbia.Greta (Cohan) accepts the job of a nanny for a wealthy couple's child and is disturbed when she finds out the child is a doll. However, when she mishandles the doll, she is shocked to find that it is alive.The Boy may be one of my favourite mainstream horror films of recent memory. When I first watched the film I loved the overall eerie tone of the film, a gorgeous gothic filming location and Lauren Cohan is a likeable actress playing the lead role. I personally loved the ending of the film, I feel like it just stepped up the films intensity for the final moments. The sequel however I can't say the same for."

Chucky... Annabelle.. etc. But after having finished watching this film I have to say this was definitely different from those two I mentioned earlier. The plot twist at the end of this film made it that different and it all made more sense as well. It was quite a bizarre plot twist but it definitely was something I didn't expect in the slightest.

Despite that I have to say that I didn't like the direction which was made by William Brent Bell because I found it very poor.

The film centers on a young woman leaving an abusive relationship who ends up accepting a position in the Englush countryside as a nanny. Soon after arriving she discovers that she'll be watching a doll named Brahms. At first she thinks it's humorous but than feels like she's taking advantage of them. But strange things begin to happen leaving her wondering if the doll is alive. The movie is well shot with some amusing nightmare sequences. William Brent Bell of the dumb but fun Stay Alive builds a mildly effective atmosphere but because it's so misleading the end result is disappointing and only marginally entertaining. The main characters soap opera back story feels for ed as well. It all culminates in a fun but disappointing finale. The end result is another forgettable but somewhat entertaining horror flick."

Of course then it starts to immediately jump into lame horror movie tropes.This is a frustrating movie for me. An interesting concept lost in a mess of tedium and cliches.

I figured it wasn't straight forward and I figured there was going to be the twist but I had my money on the grocery guy. I love when I can't guess the twist in a movie!And all these 1 star reviews saying it's unoriginal and that they saw the twist I say BS. A possessed doll, yeah thats pretty unoriginal but that twist, I'm usually good at seeing them coming and i didn't see that. And i don't think many others did either (no matter what they claim)Reminds me of a movie called Bad Ronald that I saw when I was young. I think that was a TV movie so this was allowed to do a bit more. Bad Ronald was a favorite when I was young.I'm now really looking forward to The Boy II :)"
" A modern horror classic.
",-0.5719,0.872,2020-02-22 00:00:00,10,'The Boy' is a superbly executed horror film with much to love. Incredible location for a horror film and a very interesting concept from a trailer that gives little away. 'The Boy' delivers on atmosphere and suspense aswell as constructing characters the audience will really like or dislike. I found it highly entertaining and quite original by far one of the greatest horror movies of the past 20 years. Delighted to see a sequel coming out for this modern classic! I'd recommend looking up as little about the film as you can if you haven't already watched it and go in with knowing as little as possible to avoid any obvious spoilers. 10/10 for 'The Boy.'

You have to forgive the implausible and just run with it. Some horror films do the implausible better than others and this in my view was one of them.The acting was decent, the location and cast kept simple, and there was only a couple of eye rolling 'as if you'd be that stupid' moments' e.g lone female wearing nothing but a towel after having a shower, goes into the attic, without putting any lights on, after hearing noises up there.... I really wish horror films would just cut that rubbish out!But on the whole, the story was immensely absorbing.

It was very atmospheric and slow burning. I had no trouble being engaged and wanting to know what happened next. There were only one or two jump scares as well, with the film mostly relying on sheer creepiness and weirdness.Lauren Cohan propelled the film along single-handedly. Was my first time seeing her and I'll be sure to keep an eye out for more of her stuff in future. It's just a shame the was no pay-off for the audience who persisted with the slow-burn. The final act was ridiculous, unimaginative and squandered what potential it had built early on.Ultimately turned out to be quite a forgettable horror film. Could've easily been so much better."
" The Boy by I.M. Nosferatu -- A #Nosferreview
",0.0,-0.8578,2019-12-04 00:00:00,8,"The Boy is noteworthy primarily because of actress Lauren Cohan. She definitely is on the rise to becoming the new Queen of Horror between this film and her portrayals of ""Maggie"" on The Walking Dead, ""Bela"" on Supernatural, and ""Rose"" on The Vampire Diaries. Yes, I can see her pushing that bloody tiara right off the head of Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis. (It'd also be great to see Curtis' entire head rolling right off her shoulders, but that's just me. That's how I roll. I know, gruesome - insert evil laugh.)The Boy is a British-Canadian film with a handful of characters. I find it rather twisted that Lauren has to use an American accent when cast in a role in her own country. Anyway, the plot is frightfully thin - an older couple, Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire, hires an American girl with a past, Greta Evans (Lauren), to be a nanny for their son, Brahms, while they go off on a long-overdue holiday. Aside from the fact that their boy is a dummy, something feels completely bizarro. And no, I'm not being politically incorrect here - the boy has ceramic head. He's better looking than Chucky and a far snappier dresser, but still resides somewhere deep in Creepsville. Indeed, Brahms seems to have a mind (and soul) of his own. Without saying a word, he ends up convincing gullible, vulnerable Greta that he is Boy9in fact alive after she's ignored both him and all the rules Mum and Pop have left for her. No more sipping wine in your nightie and talking on the phone to your bestie, Greta, you're getting paid to work! After a hairy stint in the attic, before you know it she's reading him his lessons, carrying him around like an infant, and even kissing him goodnight (I'd take one of those). Anyway, wow - who knew you could get the girl just by sitting there and looking so cute creepy and helpless - I personally have to resort to much greater lengths to get a girl, but that might entail rope or weapons or threats of fire and brimstone - but we won't go there, now will we? And then what the hell? Young stone-faced Brahms is so damn good, he goes on to convince Greta's new love interest and master grocery delivery boy, Malcolm (Rupert Evans), that he's a real boy, too. What are you? Stupid?Overall, the premise is SICK but the Mr. Hyde part of me says it could have been a really HORRIFIC movie if it hadn't jumped the shark midway through - but I'm not going to tell you how (the voices in my head say NO SPOILERS, damn them). Up until then it was creepy, unsettling, and rather thoughtful. I mean, it was almost as if Greta was becoming some sort of Stepford nanny. She'd spend all day reading to this Chucky clone and we had no idea why; was she spiraling into madness? Just my kind of girl! But after the plot twist? It was just meh. Predictable. A dime a dozen. And definitely not enough RED. What I need is a real SHARK ATTACK to get my world rocking.Then again my Dr. Jekyll side can appreciate a good peripeteia. After the movie shifts directions, the pace really moves and the characters get that blood coursing through their veins (still not the spewing and spouting RED I'd have wanted, but a guy can dream). The storyline transition took us from psychological thrills to horror chills, in a Jason-esque sort of way. Anyway, when my shrink was alive he'd tell me to just accept the things we can't change, so I guess this would be a good time to try. Too bad I can't ask him. Poor guy.As for the cast, Lauren was RIPPER SMOOTH as always in the role of the strong heroine - I'm a fan. Rupert Evans was pretty solid playing second banana to Lauren. Jim Norton as Mr. Heelshire and Diana Castle as Mrs. Heelshire are perfectly peculiar and entirely screwed up; and Ben Robson as Greta's ex, Cole, makes a great punk ass loser and abuser. But the real star? The ceramic kid - that is up until the final denouement when we learn the mystery to the dummy's existence. Then his acting falls to pieces.Depending upon where you look, The Boy is a film touted as ""mystery/thriller,"" ""psychological horror,"" and ""horror/mystery/thriller"" - it's obvious everyone can't seem to reach a collective decision. I guess I should have had lower expectations since the gods of Movieland didn't just give it the KRUGERIAN horror stamp of approval. So did I like it? Such is the dissociative personality that I am, I can't make up my mind just as the flick couldn't. My bad. You'll have to see it for yourself."
" CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10)
",0.837,0.9949,2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"The stage curtains open ...""The Boy"" is a refreshing twist on the creepy doll story with a clever plot and surprising ending. I've always enjoyed a good evil doll movie and expected this one to fit the mold - but what I got was a fun change of turn. A much needed movie experience in a large array of cookie cutter films.The film starts out with a young Montana girl heading to the UK as the new nanny for the Heelshires, an older couple with a special child. A boy named Brahms. She readily accepts the job trying to escape the clutches of her abusive boyfriend and a sordid past. When she arrives, she finds that Brahms is nothing more than a porcelain doll. At first, she thinks it's a joke. But seeing the seriousness of the situation, she slowly begins to realize that there is a reason behind it all. And it's not what you think. Soon, she finds herself running from anything more dangerous that even her boyfriend could be.Having seen tons of thriller/horror movies that involved a doll that appears to be able to move around on its own, watch people, and do things that they shouldn't be able to do, I settled in expecting to receive pretty much the same kind of formula. Not to be so. This movie was a nice surprise. The pacing was excellent, not lagging too long in any area, keeping the story and suspense moving straight forward until it's climactic finish. The acting was pretty good, the cinematography good as well.I highly recommend ""The Boy"". It's a sleeper hit and one to be seen more than once. As of the writing of this review, ""Brahms - The Boy II"" starring Katie Holmes will be released next February to the theaters. I am very excited for this and will be first in line. Great movie! 8 stars out of 10."

I thought it was a pretty great twist but could have been executed better. for example, after the reveal I thought about it and put it all together. but then after he attacks her, they explain it and show how it makes sense, after I had already figured all that out. still, I think it was really creative and clever."
" Stay with this!
",0.0,-0.9709,2019-06-20 00:00:00,8,"There's a moment early on in The Boy where you're either going to think it's the dumbest movie you've ever seen or completely brilliant. I err on the side of the latter, loving the audaciousness that demands that you believe that a porcelain doll could be alive. Director William Brent Bell brings you along for a great ride, keeping you wondering until the end who is really crazy here.Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan, Maggie from TV's The Walking Dead) has come to the UK from Montana to work for an elderly couple named the Heelshires. Thinking she'll be watching over a child in her role as a nanny, Greta is shocked that her charge is really a porcelain boy named Brahms.This is the point where you might want to give up on this film. I urge you to stick with it, as it gets really good from here on out.It turns out that Brahms has rejected many sitters, so Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire closes the doors to a room and begin speaking to him, asking if he approves of Greta. Now comes the time when they must instruct her on all the rules of caring for their child, which include always reading to Brahms in a loud and clear voice, playing his music loudly and always putting his food in the fridge if he doesn't finish it. Also: remember to keep setting and changing the rat traps outside so they don't get into the walls of the estate.Of course, Greta ignores these rules and does her own thing. While on the phone with her sister, she learns that her abusive ex - who she left the country to escape - has been looking for her. She also falls for Malcolm (Rupert Evans, who was on Charmed and is now on The Man In the High Castle), a grocery deliveryman.That's how she learns that when the real Brahms was eight - twenty years ago - he died in a fire. The real boy was also incredibly odd, which seems to be why strange things happen in the house: locked doors, stolen clothes and strange noises like the crying of a child. Even more frightening is that the doll is able to move between rooms on its own.Greta comes to believe that the spirit of the dead child is inside the doll, so she begins to take the rules seriously. This freaks out Malcolm, who relates a story that Brahms may have killed a young girl, but before the police could get involved, he died in the house fire. He warns her not to stay in the house, but she reveals that she had a miscarriage when her ex beat her, so she feels that caring for Brahms is her chance to atone.Do you think this film is crazy yet? It gets even more bonkers, because the Heelshires - happy that they've finally found someone worthy of their son - write a goodbye letter before drowning themselves.Of course, her ex-lover finds her and smashes the doll. But that only means that this film unlocks the next level of insanity because Brahms has been alive all along, living inside the walls, his ruined face covered with a mask that resembles the doll. The letter from his parents reveals that Greta is to be his mate. Can she escape? Will anyone survive? And how the hell are they going to top this in the sequel?Originally called In a Dark Place and starring Jane Levy (Evil Dead and Don't Breathe) before the switch to the title of The Boy and recasting the lead.I recommend this one, as long as you keep an open mind and accept that its ridiculous premise will lead to some major scares later."

Mag is a good looking woman and she's a decent actress. But not a great actress. Check out Elizabeth Olsen in Silent House for portrayal of terror. If you're honest you will agree Olsen blows away Mag. In fact, I'll go further and say Mag should give up acting after seeing Olsen's performance.This movie is boring. Mag portrays her character as not very smart, or likeable. She throws the doll. Not thinking that maybe she'll break this precious doll she's entrusted to care for. She drinks wine all day, bored and passing out. 30 something loser babysitting a doll. Then we get Mr. Bad Guy X-Boyfriend. This is movie is a boring joke. What a shame. Another example of pollution.

We were starting to run out of horror movies to watch on NETFLIX so we decided to give 'The Boy' a shot. It did not disappoint. The movie has a nice build-up, and decent character development which is not typical of the horror genre. There are scene's that genuinely creep me out, and this doll is definitely scarier than Chucky.The reason I would not score this higher than a 6 is because I was still able to walk around in my dark house after the movie. It was lackluster in terms of scaring the audience, and the most it managed to do was creep me out."

There is a lot going on in this story about death, and loss, and how the human mind substitutes and compensates and recovers.

" Pretty Solid Horror Movie
",0.0258,-0.9445,2019-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie a lot and here are my reasons:
1) It leads you to believe there is some sort of mystical presence, a spirit or ghost, but it all turns out very much ""real"", which is my kind of horror movies since I don't believe in the supernatural
2) The plot is solid and the female protagonist gets her revenge against abusive and violent men
3) Usually, when in a movie a character feels a ""presence"", they never manage to have a witness, but this time Greta finds a complice in Malcom
4) I had predicted that Malcom died because that's how usually these movies end, with a dole survivor and no ""happy ending"", but he seems pretty much surviving the attack
5) The final twist is totaly unuspected and surprising. One must not think enough to put the pieces of the puzzle together and understand what actually happened that night of the murder of the little Emily and afterward.
6) there is a twist of the twist at the very end. We are left wondering whose old hands are to put the Bhrams' pieces together recomposing the doll. I suspect it was the mother. The father was depicted as the more rational of the two, so my guess is that the wife changes her mind and resurface from the water. I might have seen a ring on the hand, not sure, so would be curious to go back to the still image and compare with mother's hand."

Did we just become best friends? Yup! Just like Brahms and Greta, I mean who wouldn't befriend a life-sized doll who appears to have a spirit living inside of it? That always seems like a good idea. The movie started off s l o w l y but it did eventually find it's pace and plotline. Meet Brahms, the ""8 year old"" boy that Greta has traveled around the world to babysit. Let's face it, she's running from her ex back in the states and a desolate village in merry ole England is the perfect solution (or so she thinks). Brahms elderly parents introduce him to Greta and at this moment you can see her disbelief. He's a porcelain doll that is carried around like a real boy and is treated just as any 8 year old boy would be. So pretty much he's got the perks Pinocchio was never privy to!
This is when things turn dicey. Brahms starts moving ""on his own"" and making Greta peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. And instead of dipping out and flying back to the U S of A, she treats Brahms like it was her own live child. Only soon to discover the real Brahms has been living in the walls. Fingers crossed for a sequel titled ""The Girl"", psych!Superlatives:Worst Friend: Greta's friend - gotta secret can you keep it...nope. I'll just tell your ex where you are hiding so he can write you a ""letter"".

eventually introduced to Brahms but there's just one odd problem...Brahms, who requires a Nanny, is not actually alive... but is in fact a life-sized doll! The parents of this so called 'child' treats it as if the doll was their real live son, completing daily tasks with the doll, and of course our nanny is instructed to do the same each day.Parents Jim and Diana decide to finally take long needed time out and leave their ""son"" in Greta's capable hands. Greta at first thinks this must be some type of joke but takes the job as it provides a worthy pay and takes her away from her current problems from her own home life...After she violates a list of strict rules, disturbing events make her believe that the doll is really alive...The biggest thumbs up from me is simply that this film's story is clever and different. The film also creates a creepy world through the use of a large house with a small cast line up. ""The Boy"" is hard to write about as I do not wish to spoil the twist and turns the film provides.While this is a great story, the pacing within the film can drag on a little. While I did enjoy the film's twist, not all events in the film lined up with the ending and become implausible once all the twist are revealed- some say this is too picky, but this is what I do.ðŸ˜‰6.0/10

" always study parents and child carefully BEFORE accepting a job as a nanny
",0.4767,0.9543,2018-12-11 00:00:00,6,"I thought that ""The Boy"" relied a bit too much on jump scares and tropes to be fully convincing. It was also too long : at least a quarter of an hour could have been cut without damage to the story, intrigue or mood. Still, it succeeded in creating a spooky atmosphere. (Congratulations to the persons who created and filmed that doll - it was seriously unnerving.)The movie also had some pretty unnerving things to say about people who have developed a hole in their self-esteem, for instance as a result of mistreatment or neglect, and try to fill the void through excessive and unreasoning devotion. Here you've got a young woman who, at some moment, throws herself body and soul in the care for a child/doll, but many readers will be able to quote other examples from real life. Many Roman-Catholic churches, for instance, are haunted by a lonely old lady who waters the plants (nice), who cleans and polishes and adorns the statue of a patron saint (still nice) and who is ready to go medieval on every impious soul daring to cough or sneeze within a thirty-feet radius of that particular statue (call the police).If you like tales about (possibly) supernatural dolls, I can recommend ""The Dressmaker's Doll"" by Agatha Christie, which has a nicely restrained British feel. This, in my humble opinion, is one of the best short horror stories written during the twentieth century."

The doll is mysterious and for gods' sake it has not any expression made at least me so frightened. Lauren Cohan is best selection for fearful leading actress. Cast is of limited numbers. Darkness of palace is gripping you since very first scene of the movie making you to connect very early to the story. Unfortunately here again ratings are very low ( i.e. 6 ), it deserves 7 or 8.

The Boy has each of those elements, but it is produced in such a way that it keeps its originality and even pays homage to the 60s British thrillers. Greta has fled to Britain from America to escape her abusive boyfriend. Whilst in the beautiful British countryside, Greta has landed a nannying role for a wealthy couple to help look after their son Brahms. When Greta arrives, not only is the mansion in the middle of nowhere, Brahms is in actual fact a porcelain doll. As the couple leaves to go on holiday, Greta is left with strict instruction on how to care for Brahms. However, failure to follow the rules has led our young American to receive a threatening phone call and unexplainable supernatural activity around the house. Is Brahms really just an innocent doll or is Greta losing her mind?......

I remember the movie from a few years ago, but never got around to watching it. The premise of the movie starts out fairly typical horror. A young women with a troubled past seeks to get away from it all by taking a job as a nanny in a remote mansion. As it turns out she is hired on to watch over a ceramic doll and from there the creepy stuff starts coming.I wasn't looking forward to this movie as I'm kind of tired of the Demonic doll cliche. It's been done so many times there is nothing new that can be brought to the table. Unfortunately this movie relies heavily on horror film cliches and tropes that are just tired.Character motivation is important to craft a believable film but it seemed the main character's actions in this movie were all over the place. Near midway through the film her actions didn't really feel real and were there just to keep the plot rolling.This movie does put a twist on the demonic doll aspect near the end of the movie that for me tried too hard to wow. It was supposed to be a grand twist no one saw coming, but felt more like Shyamalan in the Village.As far as actually horror elements the movie really provided fairly typical horror cliche moments. It was creepy constantly seeing the doll, but the movie never really captured a atmosphere that worked to intensify fear.It was not a bad movie, but it just didn't do anything to wow either. I liked that they tried to try something new, but the execution left something to be desired for. Horror has had it rough for a decade because of subpar films recycling cliches so I'm a bit rough on the genre. Overall the movie was a 5 out of 10."

" Cliched horror in the loosest sense!
",-0.6114,-0.9515,2018-08-18 00:00:00,7,"I class this as a 'horror' in the loosest sense in terms of its low age classification that seems all the more frequent these days.
It follows most of the key conventions of the horror film genre. Style, score, lighting and editing wise.
The film has a mildly interesting premise as Greta (Lauren Cohen) begins the film as an American who takes a job as a nanny for an aristocratic English couple. An oddball couple who don't actually have an 8 year old boy, but a life-sized porcelain doll.
Is the doll alive. Greta begins to think so.
Let's disect the film in detail:
1. The journey.
Well Greta comes from America and moves to an isolated home in rural England.
Not any old home. It is the classic haunted, dark, gothic mansion!
2. The ominous atmosphere.
The English couple seem uninviting and have a set of strict rules for Greta to follow when looking after the doll, Brahms.
3. The scary place. As already alluded to the house/mansion is dark, gothic and haunted looking.
Evil literally seeps from the walls!
4. Traditional horror scenes include a search in the attic ala The Exorcist.
5. Jumpscares. Several. Hands coming out of paintings etc.
6. Brahms as a doll is the 'monster' meant to amplify the surprise and terror.
Like a childhood toy?
7. An older Brahms has make up and looks akin to Michael Myers in Halloween.
8. The Final Girl. Well Greta is there right to the end.
9. A savant like character, Malcolm played by Rupert Evans knows some history of the English family and the doll set up.
10. Without revealing to much a classic sequel hook at the end. Added in case the film was a success to allow a sequel. I don't think a Boy 2 exists!
Relies on copying classic horror films to much with a distinctly B movie feel."
" One of the better creepy doll movies
",0.4404,-0.6444,2018-08-17 00:00:00,10,"I'm a fan of creepy doll movies but only when they're done well. And done well creepy doll movies are pretty thin on the ground. The Boy gets it right at deeper psychological levels because even though you know from the get go that being employed as a nanny to a life sized boy doll would have most women running for the hills, there's something tragic and poignant about the elderly couple who dote so lovingly over the angelic looking porcelain ""Brahms"" The newly employed Greta has her own problems, having lost a baby herself, so after the initial scorn of pandering to Brahm's every whim,, and when seemingly supernatural happenings occur around the doll, she strikes up a Freudian rapport with her charge and starts to really care for it. Now, this is what I have a real problem with as Greta is a fairly well balanced, strong female escaping to England to get away from her nasty violent ex boyfriend. There's not enough emotional damage in this character to warrant her connection with the doll. She's not needy enough, or fragile enough. The real show stopper is when the real Brahms, the adult Brahms, reveals himself by oozing out of a mirror in one of the creepiest reveals in movies. I didn't see it coming.The real Brahams might have been better portrayed as a podgy, flabby mewling adult baby with pallid skin and bald as a mushroom. Instead we have a tall, slim, hairy chested hottie who, in spite of the dirty vest, doll mask and Rigsby cardy, has already set the internet alight with blogs about his sex appeal. Whether this is intentional or not on the part of the director, I don't know. But I guess it makes the character all the more fascinating and it would have been interesting for him to have had more screen time and more in depth scrutiny of his psychology. Instead, the end of the movie falls into the generic slasher comes a cropper but doesn't die category, leaving it wide open to a sequel that probably won't happen. And that's a shame because had there been more to the murderous Brahms than his psycho temper this might have been possible.It would have had more impact if the script had revolved more around the psychologically damaged element of Greta and Brahms. A kind of twisted love story that worked so well in the 1960's movie, The Haunting. Instead the final denouement is a bog standard plot device.A good movie though and decent performances from the leads. James Russell has the difficult job of portraying Brahms, with most of the acting in the eyes. If you watch closely he doesn't blink once, but still manages to exude a child like vulnerability even at his most murderous."
" Genre blending horror
",-0.5719,0.6556,2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"I felt compelled to write my first review on here after seeing this film. There are some few low scores here that complain about how the story goes where you don't expect it to. Well, if it did, then surely it would just blend into every other ""doll"" film like Annabelle or Child's Play.
I personally loved it. The acting was believable. It wasn't over cooked or hammy. The characters took one another seriously rather than choosing not to believe what was going on. There were some decent back story elements.
What I also enjoyed was how creepy this film was. I had a few moments where the hairs stood up on my arms and neck. 
The twist...well I won't drop any spoilers but I believe this to be one of the very few horrors that has blended two horror sub-genres together and I found it really effective.

I thought he was English with an Irish lilt for the first few lines, then he tried some kind of broad northern American accent, and finally was so inconsistant that any of the tension created up until that point was lost and I was thrown out of the story and into wondering why in anyone's mind was this bloke a decent person to cast. He's meant to be a menacing character, but his standard English accent teamed with some bizarre rhotic Rs to try and sound American was hilarious."
" Creepy doll does the trick

Is it really worth being gratful over? I dont know, maybe Im just desperate.
 Although this film has its problems, the second act did well in showing how the main character was manipulated into caring for the doll, and made for an interesting concept. However, the pay off is cut short once the audience is subjected to the neck-bearded man bursting out of the wall and his high-pitched cries of ""mommy"". On paper, the suprise ending may have done better, but after all the buildup the ending is rather disappointing. I cant bash the writers for trying something new with the haunted doll trope, but it definitly takes away from the atmosphere of the film. The ex-boyfriend subplot is only forgivable because of his controlling nature; the main character starts losing controll of her life and mental state after succumbing to the doll, and once her creepy ex shows up, she is almost unable to resist his demands for her to come back to the U.S. with him. But the moment he breaks the doll, the plot falls through and the tension is broken. Overall, the idea of a deranged child killer living in his parents basement, whille creepy in real life, doesnt work that well in The Boy. Maybe if the story had taken on a more Hardy Boys/Agatha Christie esc tone, or even as a Vincent Price esc melodrama thats not afriad to be a little campy, it may have done better, but of course its too late now."

I was held interested until the very end and I can honestly say no modern horror movie has done that. I wasn't ""terrified"" or anything of that degree, but I was drawn into it with suspense and curiosity on how the story would unfold.
 It was set in a nice creepy environment and the cast makes you invested in their characters and you do have a certain sense of care for them. The ending wasn't quite what I was expecting but it was decent.... meaning nothing over the top or outlandish but I wished it ended differently. The ending wasn't bad to say the least, just not the way I would have ended it. 
 I would recommend this film for anybody looking to have an enjoyable, relaxed thriller to watch.... no gore or ridiculous/ obvious CGI (which kills most horror movies for me). I give it a high 7 closer to 8 stars."

Not to say that this one is bad, but it's not flawless. I feel like the entirety of the movie would have been good if it continued with the ""possessed doll"" feel to it to the very end. The twist ending, while it makes sense, is kind of what killed this movie for me. I do give it a 7/10 for great acting, amazing cinematography, a fantastic script, and outstanding pacing. The twist did make the ending bad, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable to watch.If you liked this movie, I recommend a New Zealand movie that feels similar, but it's a dark comedy, called Housebound."

",0.2023,-0.7923,2018-06-21 00:00:00,8,"'The Boy' suffers from 'how American writers think English people speak', I'll get that out of the way first. For example, the grocery boy Malcolm (Rupert Evans) says things like ""I'm considered quite charming in this country."" Evans is encouraged to use a well-spoken but entirely region-free accent throughout. It's not a huge issue, and UK films are not always accurate in their representation of US characters either. If you can get past that - and there are far worse examples out there - then there is much to enjoy with this.Miss Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan), an American Nanny, travels to a gothic mansion to tend to the needs of an elderly couple's young son Brahms. It is difficult to escape the central storyline in the publicity - the fact that Brahms is a doll initially filled me with reservations. Could such a realisation be taken seriously? Andrew Jones' series of low-budget projects involving Robert the Doll is good, for example, but suffers a little when the prop figure is required to move.There was little need to worry: this is a cracker: restrainedly directed by William Brent Bell at least initially, and written in the same way. Greta is just as incredulous as to the notion of a living doll as the most cynical audience member, and yet when she has reason to be convinced if the reality of its existence, we are too. Brahms is a ghostly looking, handsome doll, sometimes very life-like and often lifeless, as necessary.Greta's willingness to care for Brahms is reasoned by a miscarriage she suffered at the hands of an abusive relationship with a character called Cole (Ben Robson). Cole suddenly turns up at the house demanding Greta returns home with him. He is, of course, exactly the kind of overbearing bully we want him to be - and then we can begin the business of desperately wanting some punishment for him. This is when the pace moves from slow-burning build-up to pure horror. When the resultant manifestation of Brahms reveals itself, the fragile build-up takes a step back in favour of Jason/Michael Myers territory; whilst this doesn't carry the same kind of emotional weight we've enjoyed so far, it is still effective. The finale explains things away and makes sense of it all, but there is a slight disappointment that the spell has been punctured with reality. As a whole, though 'The Boy' works beautifully, far better than I expected it to."

The movie was genuinely creepy up to that point. But then when it was revealed what was going on, it just all crashed hard and loudly.Good performances from a very small cast, so there was a lot of weight on the actors and actresses. The movie had a fairly good cast all round, and I must admit that Lauren Cohan actually stepped up here and had a more convincing portrayal of emotions and character here than she does in ""The Walking Dead"".The movie really had potential to become something unique, and it was well on the way, but then the entire house of cards just collapsed faster than you could blink."

" The Boy did so well to sustain suspense, only for it to fall apart in its final act.

It seems as of late that a trend has circulated, particularly in horror thrillers, for unnecessary plot twists. The Boy unfortunately succumbs to that fatal error. Essentially, an American girl moves to England for her new job as a nanny. Unbeknown to her, she is caring a doll that the parents believe is their real son Brahms. She must follows the rules precisely because if she doesn't...well, little Brahms may not be happy. What an interesting plot this was! Not entirely original, but creepy films about creepy dolls being creepy are so damn infrequent these days that it actually felt refreshing. The first two acts were splendid. Plenty of dark lighting to create the moody atmosphere as our protagonist wanders around a humongous mansion...alone. Very well paced, slowly placing breadcrumbs to feed our minds with intrigue. Is the doll possessed? Is the doll actually a real boy? Why on earth is it made out of ceramics!? These people need to shop in IKEA. Plastic is the way forward. Anyway, all was going so well and then...we enter the third act. Why oh why oh why did they think the twist was a good idea? We've now changed sub-genres from the supernatural to...well I can't say without spoiling it but if you watch it, you'll know what I mean. All the mystery, the intrigue, the damn captivation...gone. Instantly. Diminished like it was someone picking gum off of their shoe. Look, I can see why they did it, and theoretically, in a far-fetched way, plausible. But no, no, noooo. Didn't work for me I'm afraid. The acting was serviceable though, I mean Lauren Cohan and Rupert Evans were good. Although, there is no way she could've wrapped a towel round her and walk up steep ladders into the attic, be trapped there all night, come down and STILL have that towel wrapped. I smell lies. Overall, a well directed thriller with a few jump scares and an intriguing premise that is utterly decimated by its third act."
" You have been a bad doll, um Boy, Brahms!
",-0.5848,0.9563,2018-02-26 00:00:00,6,"In all fairness, using dolls (porcelain dolls, mannequins, ventriloquist dummies, ...) in horror movies is almost like a quick win. What I mean by that is that dolls already look scary and menacing from themselves, and if you then film them from certain angles or play around with lighting effects and add a creepy musical score, it's as good as guaranteed that people will refer to it as ""truly terrifying"" or ""scary as hell"". Finding a good and solid story that connects with the dolls is what's proving difficult in most cases! I must have been in a generous mood when watching ""The Boy"", because I dug the story and even tolerated the many clichÃ©s, stereotypes, abrupt plot twists and grotesque finale. Greta, a young American woman, travels through the rural British countryside on her way to start an au-pair/nanny assignment she accepted. She arrives at a spooky old mansion and learns that her employers are bizarre elderly folks, but that's the least of her concerns! Greta must babysit an eerie porcelain doll, named Brahms, while its ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" go on holiday to the English coast for the very first time in their lives! Assuming the old folks are crazy and she's making easy money, Greta naturally ignores Brahms at first and disregards the strict list of rules she received, but via a few strange occurrences she quickly becomes convinced that the doll is alive and begins to take good care of him. Admittedly Brahms is a creepy little fella! The idea of a posh and bratty English lad reincarnated in a large porcelain doll is unsettling, and director William Brent Bell mounts the atmosphere and tension quite professionally, through a steadily slow pacing, good use of the old house filming location, hinting at the tragic events that overcame the real boy Brahms and the wise decision never to animate the doll or make it move individually. Certain story aspects are dreadful, like the clichÃ©d appearance of the ""bad boyfriend"" for instance, but I reckon also inevitable to insert at least a minimum of body count. In other user-comments, I read that most people severely dislike the plot-twist that occurs in the third act of the film, but yours truly actually appreciates the rather brute change in tone & pacing. The twist makes sense from a narrative point of view, considering what we previously found out about what happened to Brahms and his parents, and at least it provides the film with a good dose of more than welcome action and speed. Lauren Cohen gives away an exceptionally good performance; - even one of the best I've seen in horror films from actresses of her generation. The Brahms-doll looks creepy, but as mentioned at the beginning of the review, I don't really consider that to be a great achievement. The dolls & puppets in movies like ""Poltergeist"", ""Annabelle"", ""Robert/The Curse of Robert the Doll"" and ""The Fear"" looked scary as well, but the stories sucked."

The other reviews have summed it up well - a girl alone in a huge house in the middle of nowhere ""looking after"" a doll - but the story does a lot to actually make you feel for the doll and shortly after the girl's ex arrives there are so many directions that the story can go in.Definitely a must-see and would highly recommend avoiding any spoilers before watching. **SPOILERS**It seems most people's issue with the film is the actual ending that was chosen, which to me was more refreshing and creepy than having a supernatural cause (would have been better, IMO, if Sinister had taken such an approach). Sure, it's not that realistic, unless you imagine that living in the walls was only when visitors were around and possibly the parent's doll-treatment as well, but in any case Brahms is described as ""odd"" by his father. One of the things that I found more problematic was that his face was actually badly scarred - you see this around 1.5 hours in, when part of his mask cracks after the ""good night"" scene. I had assumed that the parents faked the fire that Brahms ""died"" in, but suppose he could have started the fire himself and somehow burned his face in doing so..."

I love twists. Sadly, the twist here is that the ending was such a deflated balloon of crap that I almost turned it off and I didn't. The twist is that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and didn't keep my eyes on the runtime. The twist is that I have more patience than I thought I did. Surprise!The only way other folks could possibly claim that this movie had a twist at the end is if they were tripping on something strong at the time AND thought they were either watching a drama or romantic comedy. Then, maybe, the nonsense that transpires would be surprising. It is not scary. It's not disturbing. It's not creepy. It doesn't build tension over time. Nobody's actions ever ultimately make sense unless you do a ton of digging through the review boards to try to find answers, and even then, it's admittedly full of holes. The really sad thing is it has me longing for the stupid decisions people make in scary movies that DO lead to some sort of fright, even if it's a cheap jump scare. It's not even just that the ending disappoints, it's an entire premise that sort of makes us feel like jerks for sticking around for the whole thing.What everyone has said about plot holes, both within the world of the movie and the real world, is spot on. What they have said about missed potential to portray this differently and under another genre is also a good call.

Like the vast majority of more modern horror films, the fact that the film is so tame and obviously based on appealing to a mass audience. The fact that it tries so hard to ensure that there's something to ensure no sexuality or even violence in the situation as there's plenty of situations that can allow for something to happen yet the self- imposed censorship here with its tame atmosphere is the biggest issue. Obviously, this is an issue for the scenes of her walking around in a towel but the large brawl at the finale really should've gone further with its violence than what happens here and it comes off even more so due to the lack of action until then where it doesn't have the chance to provide that. That is another problem here where it tends to spend so long on her behavior around the doll and what's in her head about the situation to the point of not really feeling like a horror film for large portions of time. Going through the motions with her normal tendencies towards the doll and all the duties that entails on the mansion grounds that takes up a large part of the first half here is not only not all that well- designed for scares but seems rather bland all that more obvious based on the actions beforehand, which all really holds this one down. There are a few areas that do work rather well here, mainly in the rather intriguing atmosphere built up here about what the stunning and somewhat creepy house here where it's Gothic layout and build certainly add a great deal to the possibility of the doll being alive. The scenes of them interacting as she goes against the rules which causes her to believe it's following her make for quite an atmospheric start to this one, and although it doesn't do much horror-based action it allows for a solid build-up to the finale which is where this one really shines. Once the boyfriend shows up and gets involved, the true twist of the film is revealed and sets this off on a solid, action-packed path with a solid series of chasing around the house which gives this some incredibly tense and thrilling confrontations in this section to end it on a high note. These here are what help this one overcome the flaws in the first half.Rated PG-13: Mild Violence and Language."
" Variations on a theme.
",0.0,0.6946,2017-10-02 00:00:00,6,"American nanny Greta Evans (Lauren Cohen) travels to England to begin a new job looking after Brahms, the son of well-to-do couple Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle). Greta is shocked when it is revealed that Brahms is actually a life-size doll that the Heelshire's treat as though it were a real boy. When the bemused nanny is left alone with Brahms for a week while his 'parents' take a break, a series of bizarre events lead Greta to believe that the doll might actually be alive after all.For the most part, The Boy is a predictable but very effective chiller, the well-worn creepy doll motif resulting in some well crafted scares and lots of atmosphere, the viewer left just as confused about events as Greta. Are the happenings at the Heelshire house of a supernatural nature, or is there a more logical answer? After the steady build up by director William Brent Bell, one longs for a satisfying resolutionâ€”something really clever to take the audience by surpriseâ€”which makes it all the more disappointing when the truth is finally revealed. I'm not going to spoil it for you by writing what it is, suffice to say that the ending doesn't live up to all that has gone before.***Possible spoiler*** By complete coincidence, I viewed The Boy immediately after watching cult oddity Bad Ronald, with which it shares one big similarity."
" Thrilling, Chilling and all round brilliant
",0.7783,0.255,2017-09-21 00:00:00,8,"The Boy is a thriller-horror movie that was released in 2015; a young American nanny travels to England to escape her past and babysit a young couple's son whilst they go on holiday - only for the son to be a doll. Predictably, the doll begins to do creepy things when she doesn't adhere to the strict rules that she is meant to. The editing in this film is extremely well done and seriously helps to build up an atmosphere, and countless times I had goosebumps crawling up my arms. Continuing on from the usual paranormal activity, that isn't really original in the doll horror genre, everything gets turned on it's head when the plot is twisted, and the film becomes even more terrifying, just for the more realist aspect of it. Lauren Cohan did absolutely amazing acting in this movie; there is no doubting she was one of the best choices for this role, and the film just wouldn't be the same without her carrying it. Although I have no idea how she kept her cool, having to act most of the scenes with a doll - I would have been in hysterics most of filming.The Boy was absolutely chilling, and I would recommend this to any horror lover."

The actors, especially Lauren Cohan as Greta Evans and Rupert Evans as Malcolm, strive to do everything they can. But the script is really insulting to the basic common sense. Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle, in the role of the Heelshires, are OK too. Super awful, not just awful!"

She was attractive in THE WALKING DEAD but we only ever got to see her dirty and without makeup. In THE BOY she is quite stunning and a very good actor which helps as well.The film THE BOY started off quite effectively. Remote location, weird employers, and a passably believable explanation for the doll. When the old couple leaves for a 'holiday' it's understandable that Greta would put the doll aside and do her own thing. But then the 'antics' start.I found Greta's reactions to the initial pranks be totally unrealistic. Surely your first thoughts would not be that the doll was alive! If I started finding my stuff disappearing and appearing in other places, I'd be searching for a human perpetrator.But Greta manages to become a true believer of the haunted doll in a few minutes flat. I may even have been forgiven this but she manages to make Malcolm, (the horny delivery man), a true believer in a few minutes as well. It felt like a rushed script and came across as surreal and unnatural.The old boyfriend turning up was a waste of screen time. The twist of Brahm's reality was bizarre and unsupported by a coherent back- story.Here's what I think happened. The writer/s made an unnecessary mess of the plot, the director tried to include all of the ideas only to have the producer cut and paste it together badly.Only worth watching to admire Lauren's talent."

Normally the unusual occurrences gradually escalate, lulling the protagonist into a false sense of security, so that by the time they realise all is not as it should be, they're already in too deep to think clearly, and get the heck out of Dodge. There's no such excuse here. The film rubs everybody's face in the creepy, from the off.So why did she stay?? Her internal monologue should have been as follows:""I don't care how much I need the money; the lady of the house just told me that she thinks a DOLL moved my shoes... I don't need this lunacy... BUH-BYE!""It's also not scary when you find out that Brahms is a Voorhees knockoff with a chest rug, in a cardigan!"

The atmosphere is built up with a classic remote castle and a creepy family. Then you're made to believe there is a ghost in the house, and the movie would have been so much better if that had been the case, but in the end it's just some stupid parody of a Jason or Michael Meyers guy running around in a mask. The entire movie does not answer any of the questions that are built up and the writer seems confused about how to write an ending to a good horror movie, so they ended up with a disappointing murderer in the walls. If you like movies like mirrors, the ring, etc. Do not watch this movie. It will disappoint you."

Strange things occur, when she ignores the rules of tending to him and suspects that the doll is alive. Evans plays young man, Malcolm who delivers groceries and befriends Greta. This is OK, but don't expect another ""Annabelle"" or ""Child's Play,"" Cohan is good in it and probably the only highlight of the film in my opinion."

I find it odd how Cohan and Natalie Dormer from G.O.T., r on 2 of the most watched TV shows yet one of their 1st major roles since finding fame on said shows r in bad, horror movies. I have more questions than answers about this movie: 1)how did the family get in contact with Greta, 2) y did Greta decide to go to England, 3) y the hell didn't she leave when she realized those nuts wanted her to watch their doll, 4) y did Greta's friends or family (whoever the hell she was on the phone with) the ppl who knew where she was; decide to give her whereabouts to someone who beat her so violently it caused an abortion, 5) how was Cole able to get to her so quickly, 6) if the parents were supporting Brahms' life y did they commit suicide (where they feeling guilty for the position they were putting Greta in?), 7) what was the point of the fire story if Brahms was alive without one burn mark on him, 8) did Brahms even kill the Briggs girl, 9)y was no one able to fight Brahms off considering they outnumbered him 3 to 1! 10) what was the point of the ambiguous ending?

" A Bit of a Let-Down
",0.0,0.6643,2017-08-17 00:00:00,5,"The Boy is an entertaining movie for about 3/4 of its length, presenting the viewer with an atmospheric creepiness reminiscent of 1978's MAGIC or the Annabelle/Conjuring series. William Brent Bell did it right by commissioning a premium quality doll, almost lifelike in its presentation. He furthers the unease by posing the doll in unique sets and shots that stay with you (for example, who can forget the boy perched on the edge of his bed, looking out into the hallway?. Or sitting in the fancy upholstered chair? Or at the kitchen table?)However, the movie eventually falls into trite and predictable mechanisms. And once they start, they pile up. The new love interest. The sudden appearance of the abusive boyfriend. And, of course, the emergence of the boy who never really died, and the subsequent chase through a darkened house.How was this predictable? The film makers virtually hit you over the head with it, stressing two or three times that The Boy was eight years old when he died twenty years ago. It's almost as if they're telling the viewer to ""do the math"", so that when the boy appears as a sheltered adult, it's actually anti-climactic. Still, I gave it five stars for its technique early in the film. I suppose any other ending would have been just as trite. There's only so much you can do with a ""doll"" film."
" Good But Could Have Been Better
",0.7003,-0.9717,2017-08-14 00:00:00,6,"Joining the likes of Chuckie and Annabelle is Brahms, a life-sized porcelain doll who figures prominently in this creepy horror film.Greta, a young woman who's taken a job as a nanny to an eight-year-old boy in a mansion in a remote part of English countryside has taken the assignment to escape romantic troubles. She's more than a little surprised, though, to discover that her new charge is actually a doll. He's the stand-in for the son of the dotty elderly couple the Heelshires, whose real son was killed in a fire 25 years earlier.Departing for their first holiday in decades, they leave Greta with a list of instructions for Brahms' care, including never covering his face and kissing him before he goes to bed. Initially put off by the situation's craziness, Greta soon settles into the mansion and in between handling unappealing assignments such as emptying rat traps, she periodically enjoys the company of Malcolm, the charming grocery deliveryman who shamelessly flirts with her.You can probably guess what happens next.Brahms seems to have a life of his own, mysteriously throwing off the blanket covering him, shifting positions and even moving from room to room. Greta at first puts this down to her imagination, but the more it happens, the more she suspects something is wrong. She even manages to persuade Malcolm that the doll is possessed by the spirit of the dead boy. At first things go smoothly, with Greta cooing over Brahms, but the unexpected arrival of her former boyfriend Cole, results in all hell breaking loose.The film generally succeeds in creating an eerie atmosphere, filling the screen with extended close-ups of sinister-looking toys, mounted animal heads and various architectural details of the house's nooks and crannies. However, with it only being a PG-13 there's a limitation on how creepy the movie can be which is a let down, BUT it's still a very watchable horror yarn."

Little does she know the wealthy owners of the grand house she'll be staying in have a doll as a son, with many rules that must be followed to keep the boy happy. Seems easy enough, until she deviates from the set guidelines, and spooky things start to happen...The Boy typically goes through the motions as you await answers and, unfortunately, the sequences the trailer gets you hyped for can't make up for the mess that comes later. Manipulative scare tactics through camera work and audio are abound in this wannabe horror; more than likely to elicit groans than chills except for the most undemanding of horror film-goers. There are many poor attempts to get you hooked, which is down to lazy writing with a premise seemingly ripe for atmospheric chills.Then it botches its finale. A simple, supernatural ending would have sufficed, but instead the scripts pretentious beats overwhelmingly take over in the final act with an unconvincing twist/explanation that erases everything that held promise in the occasionally creepy outset. The horror movie trope of what's left unseen is more scary is ironically undermined here, where the opposite may have been a more worthy way to instil some dread. When you watch a horror film, you hope its adept enough to force you to watch through splayed fingers, but here you'll be doing that for the wrong reasons. 5/10"
" Love it
",0.6369,0.9651,2017-06-12 00:00:00,10,"I really love this movie! First I didn't hope too much on this movie since I got really disappointed on Annabelle (2014), but this movie turned out so good, above my expectation. This movie is about a woman (Greta) who force herself to take a job as a nanny in a remote area because she really needs the money. It turns out the boy who she needs to handle is a creepy boy doll. The boy's parents act and treat him like he is a real human boy. It made Greta confuse at the beginning but the couple succeed convincing Greta to work with them, and with all those strange rules. Then, the parents go to vacation, leaving Greta alone in the mansion with that creepy doll, and strange things start to happens. Greta is not allowed to leave the mansion, she try not to scared and bored. Her only humans to speak are her sister on the phone and a handsome grocery delivery man who only comes once a week.(Spoiler alert) In the earlier scenes, Greta heard sounds from behind the ceiling and walls, she thinks it's rats because Mr. Heelshire (the boy's father) told her before his vacation that there's many pests, especially rats in the mansion area. Then, it's occur to happen that Greta's belongings are lost or change place, I thought oh, it's that possessed boy doll who moves her belongings, just like other ghost movies, but when she heard a heavy foot steps every time she thinks the doll moves, I assumed maybe there's no boring ghost at all but a real human being who did those things, and it turned out yes, there's no ghost or supernatural things at all, the boy doll is just a simple ordinary doll, with the real killer guy is hiding behind their ceiling and walls for all the time! It's so creepy, and I love this kind of creepy. This movie will give you a good mystery atmosphere, and some surprising scenes too. This movie is very similar with When a Stranger Calls (1979 and 2006), and some of Alfred Hitchcock's, and other psychological thrillers. If you like those kinds of movies, you will like The Boy too."

She is surprised that the child she is to take care of is not a real child but a doll, named Brahms.The Boy really for the most part is a wonderful treat for those who like spooky goings on but don't like psychological horrors where half of the film is just about investigating the past. Yes there is minor investigations by Greta but it's just bare minimum investigations. It's set in a most apt ye old house and does feel very atmospheric at times.There are some cheap jump scares but i was totally sucked in to the story of this movie. This movie didn't go where i wanted it to but i still liked it. Could of been better though."

She acts convincingly here, and does well to bury her Maggie character enough for us to believe she is the girl in this film.This review contains spoilers, so please don't read on if you haven't seen the film.The film starts with Greta, a young woman starting a new job at a mansion house as a nanny for Brahms, an 8-year-old-boy. The child's parents are elderly which is a surprise. But the even bigger shock comes when the parents reveal the boy to be a life size doll. At first Greta thinks it's a joke, and treats it so until the parents leave the mansion house to 'go on holiday'. This is when things get weird. Greta starts believing the boy to be really alive. Or if not, that the doll is possessed with a spirit. Good, or evil???Here's the spoiler...Malcolm, the local guy who delivers the weekly shopping, SHOULD HAVE BEEN the real Brahms, and 'in with it' sort of speak. But he isn't. The reason why I say this is I found Malcolm incredibly creepy and his chat up lines to Greta, embarrassing. The fact he is the innocent party in this is such a wasted opportunity to make him guilty of something...as I said to be Brahms. I won't reveal the ending, but suffice to say I can understand why people are annoyed by it.I give it a solid 7/10. My only gripe, there wasn't more characters in it."

It was entertaining because it had you guessing throughout the entire film and had you on the edge of your seat. It was thrilling and a well made film. The educational aspect of this film was a bit dry. There wasn't a moral of the whole story. there was good literary value to this film. The external conflict was Greta taking care of the doll and trying to figure out who's causing all of the mischief. It also was Greta and Malcolm trying to find a way to help the boy's spirit come to peace. The internal conflict was within Greta and her past. Both these conflicts were developed well and were straight forward. Overall this film was a different and unique take on the thriller genre. I would definitely recommend this film to others."

Seriously, this is the last warning. You shouldn't still be reading at this point. So for those of you who saw the film, I appreciated some of the plot developments and had high hopes for the movie up until the point when grown up mask-wearing Brahms crawled out of the wall. For me, that was the moment where it seemed like the filmmaker brought in a new crew of writers who were unaware of anything that had been written up until that point. Sure, it was awesome seeing big ol' not-dead Brahms murder Cole, but aside from that the movie no longer makes sense. Consider this:1. First of all, if you see a big psycho killer bust out of a wall, wearing a scary as $hiznit mask, how long would it take you to reach the exit? Right. Me too. I would outrun a cheetah.2. Seeing a masked killer crawling out of the wall in and of itself would scare the hell out of Freddie Kruger, but if the killer proceeded to attack a dangerous, violent stalker, would your first reaction be put your life on the line to defend the stalker? NO! Did Malcolm and Greta forget that Cole is dangerous and would likely kill them if he hadn't been interrupted by this new development? This was their chance to get out of that house and get away from Cole, and yet they stay and fight. Ridiculous.3. Why did the lights dim and the walls shake when Cole broke the doll?4. Since Brahms didn't die in the fire, what was the purpose of the doll if it was not housing the spirit of Brahms? 5. If the old couple knew their son was alive, living up in the attic, why did they become so attached to the doll, treating it as though it were their son? 6. In the end, why is Brahms putting the doll back together? What's the point?7. Greta stabbed Brahms in the upper abdomen twice with a long screwdriver. Those are mortal wounds. I'm not a physician but if a person has any chance of surviving such a wound I believe they would need immediate skilled medical assistance at a state of the art facility. The film established that the house was in the middle of nowhere, so are we expected to believe that Brahms just ""got better""? What... he just bucked up and walked it off? Please.In summary, it was well acted, Greta was hot, and honestly, the old broad looked pretty sexy in her tight skirt. I definitely got some visceral oedipal vibes. Her psychosis and stern demeanor only added to her allure, and it's a shame they didn't explore this at all. Other than the sexy ladies, this flick was a loser."

The plot started off as intriguing, babysitting a doll instead of a regular boy. The scenes was fine. The doll looked creepy. The atmosphere was ominous which i liked, the build up to the point where the dude finally broke the doll was good. The twist may have some controversy whether it's good or just plain bad. however, i can still go with the ending. Sure, you can say ""This dude, hiding for about 20 years, just wanted to secretly move a doll so that he can get some scare and attention from a woman? get real!"" Well, he is an odd ball, so yeah that explains it...not. Further explanations why he is acting like that may be needed in the movie, i think. his obsession over dolls came out of nowhere.It was a decent movie. worth watching for fun. 6.3/10"

And it's pretty easy to guess when its obvious Greta is not alone in the house. Having the ex Cole arrive out of no where, just makes the plot ridiculous. How could he have gotten there so fast and found the right place. I mean why would the guy back home even give Cole the correct address to begin with.And considering how mean Cole is, you know something will happen to him.FINAL VERDICT: not a good thriller, skip it."

If you read a few of the other IMDb reviews you may be confused about whether this film is a quality production, let alone if it is a ""good"" horror movie. I have some answers for you.Yes, there is no arguing against the quality in this horror movie. The production values are good, the actors are fine. The plot is superficially routine - is the doll alive?, and may turn off potential viewers before it is watched because the trailer and promos look so much like another 'evil doll' scary movie. It is actually very original and it may be extremely scary, depending on your own life experiences. If you have never had any real life scares from real people, and if you need heavy duty blood and guts to be satisfied with a horror movie you likely will be one of those who finds this movie slow and uninspired. If you are a compassionate person who has a lot of empathy, watch out! You might have nightmares after seeing this.I am about to watch it a 3rd time, and am doing so in the morning - as a precaution."

Certainly not a doll, how creepy it might look. My wife on the other hand is terrified by those things. So it was quite funny to see her scared while watching The Boy. The movie itself isn't bad and I guess people that are afraid for the obvious things mentioned before might score it a bit higher. For me it was just entertaining but I never had the horror feeling like I have whilst watching other movies in this genre. The cast isn't bad, the story is a bit weird but not bad, even though I could have had a bit more information at the end. To me it could all have been more bloody to make it more interesting but it's still an okay movie to watch once."

So I toughed it was alright.The second act I think is brilliant, she suddenly realizes that if you do what it wants it doesn't do anything scary. Greta sees the boy as her child and treats him like that. You see that she really starts to care about him. At this point I toughed that I was seeing a really brilliant 'horror' movie.The third act is what ruined this movie Greta's ex boyfriend with who she had problems with comes to the house and to make a long story short they get into a fight what leads to the ex boyfriend destroying the doll. You see the wall burst and a men climbs out of the wall he kills the ex boyfriend and Greta runs away. She sees that the boy was never a doll and lived in the walls she runs away keeping the man alive.I think the twist at the end was really weird and I don't understand why the writers did it like that.

This type of tale has been played out in recent years but still manages to entertain a lot of horror fans out there.The boy goes in a slightly new direction with the ""doll genre."" Which is a welcome sight I'm sure. The boy focuses on a rich family in the UK that tragically lost their son in a fire 20 years before the film is set. On the same day as the tragedy a doll had appeared and the family believed it was their lost son. Our main character has taken on the task of watching the boy whilst the parents go on holiday. Interesting enough plot slightly different to the usual. The acting is good and contains a decent amount of character development, which is something you don't always see in horror movies. You don't have to wait to long before things start going bump in the night which, again, I feel is a welcome sight. The middle of the film is entertaining and contains some jump scares but the film mostly relies on the tense atmosphere and the viewers apprehension. The finale...leaves a lot to be desired I'm afraid to say. It appears that writers seem to have an obsession with twists, which isn't always a bad thing. However this writer decided to go a bit to far and seemingly sprints off in a different direction leaving the viewer disappointed and wondering what the hell just happened. To be honest I'm still trying to wrap my head around it as I'm writing this. We find out that the doll is not actually haunted but is being moved around by the real and very much alive son who has been living in the walls. Now we are shown that the walls are hollow and he has access to the entirety of the mansion. But, for me at least, it still leaves a lot of questions for example: How fast is he? There are several scenes where the doll moves in a matter of seconds yet we are given no sign of how a man could do that. Whats worse is that the notion of this ending wasn't even hinted at not in the slightest. It always disappoints me when an ending screws up the film when the writer/s decide to ""keep us on our toes."" In a ridiculous way that doesn't seem to match the story what-so-ever. However despite the finale I did still very much enjoy the bulk of the films content. I do still recommend watching this film if you have little else to watch or just simply bored."
" The worst and the most boring movie ever
",-0.7713,-0.8983,2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"Here i am, just watching for some good movie to watch. And i run across this one in one of the topics on Facebook. God, who forced me too look this? 3AM, a lonely girl(me) and the movie that can't be less scary or more dumb. I am very disappointed. Trailer was good, the beginning was good. But the point of the story? Three year old kid wouldn't get scared! Gosh, Hollywood producers, get some imagination! A complete failure. Actors are miserable, Bram's story is incomplete,his character is so weak,Cole's character is lame, Malcolm is a pussy, and this main role, whatever her name is, has no enough emotions for this kind of situation. All in all, a complete mess. I thought that i will give it 2 votes because of the good camera angles and quality, but i changed my mind considering that it's 21st century and that quality should be conceivable. Do not waste your time!"
" Bad plot holes
",-0.5423,-0.818,2017-01-25 00:00:00,5,"This is not a horror movie, rather a thriller. And the thriller is not good either, because the actors are more than mediocre and the plot has inexplicable holes. The 'clever' twist undoes the complete story we have been told before, and - all the worse - it is just improbable, because with this premise, you cannot explain why the parents of the 'boy' behave the way they do. There is no good reason for watching this movie, it is just an example of bad screenplay writing and acting. There are some beautiful views of the old English manor, the unsettling doll etc., but it all makes no sense in the end. This movie feels as if a young and stupid American tried to imagine a creepy story in an old British manor. ;)"
" Poor
",-0.4767,0.2933,2017-01-13 00:00:00,4,This filmed had potential to be really good but the script was to conservative to test the boundaries.The look was incredible but that is not enough to make up for a poor script. It never knew what it wanted to be and that was the problem.It had a few cool scenes but ultimately leaves you wanting more.The cast were fine but I'm sure they were not satisfied with what they were given.I'm not sure why they went the direction they did for a dull overused ending but that's Hollywood these days.I'm a fan of good stories this was simply ludicrous at times borrowing from other films but with a poorer execution.
" Ridiculous until the twist, when it becomes laughable
",-0.3182,-0.9235,2017-01-06 00:00:00,3,"The last thing I expected 'The Boy' to be was sensible and realistic, but even I didn't predict just how ridiculous things would get in this movie. Perhaps I would have been able to overlook some of the film's many flaws if it was actually scary, but it just isn't.If two total strangers asked you to look after their creepy looking doll at their even creepier looking house, you'd run for the hills. But this is a horror movie, and Nanny Greta just goes along with it. When strange things start happening, even somebody stupid enough to agree to babysitting a doll would have got out of there.Just when you think the film can't possibly get any more ridiculous, one of the most absurd plot twists I've ever seen occurs. It will almost certainly leave you in fits of laughter."
