" It captures your heart and never lets it go.
",0.0,0.999,2020-09-27 00:00:00,10,"It's been 5 years since I first watched this movie and it is still my favourite of all time. I wasn't the type of person to ever rewatch movies because I thought they'd lose their charm... but with this one it never happened and I think I've watched it at least 10 times. I am also not the type of person to ever leave reviews, but here I am now with the account I've decided to make 5 minutes ago.
This movie captured my attention completely from the first few minutes. I was fond of Gethin Anthony since his role in Game of Thrones, but I'd never thought I'd see this part of him. In this movie, he's a stereotypically rude American that visits Denmark with the sole purpose of finding his grandfather with his guy best friend. Things don't go as planned, at least until he meets Effy, a beautiful and daring girl that spills coffee on William's important envelope (maybe it was meant to happen?). And from here, the love story unfolds. At first, he doesn't really understand the girl's motives for helping him, and he doesn't really want to either, because all he ever felt for a girl before was lust and never love (as he firstly stated to Effy). And it applied to her case too, for a little, before Effy dropped the bomb and he became more confused than ever. They continued their little adventure and it is noticeable how he becomes more addicted to her presence, how he slowly falls in love. He went from 'I don't think I've ever been in love before' to 'I think I'm in love with you'. And let's not forget that the movie action takes place for 4 days (and only 3 of them are spent with Effy). They didn't need more to create a meaningful connection. Effy is a very alluring and interesting girl. Her way of saying things is very mature and mysterious, yet playful, which makes her so unique.
There are three special scenes that I will never be able to forget: the visit at the museum, where William notices the striking similarity between Effy's face and a thousand year old statue, the karaoke scene where Effy sings (intense eye contact between the two), and, of course, the ending. I saw the ending as very poetic. Will apparently listened to the story about the two seas meeting in the centre, creating the perfect love relationship, and he decides to visit it, which leads me to a hopeful future for the two characters.
Every time I rewatched the movie, I kept noticing new details and connections that made it even better than I first considered. For example, did you notice how Will grabs her hand when she takes him to 'see' Sweden? I thought it was a cute gesture.
The script is so well thought and the portrayal of the characters is immaculate. Everything connected with me completely and that is why this is my favourite movie."
" Totally Unlikeable Main Character
",0.0,0.7546,2020-08-10 00:00:00,2,"The problem with this movie is the main character. He becomes very hard to watch after 20 minutes or so as he apparently has no redeeming qualities. I don't mind an unlikeable character at all, in the hands of a great director and a great actor, but Will just grates on the nerves. For the whole movie.
If the script had gone through two or three more re-writes, they might have had something here. But aside from an interesting performance from Frederikke Dahl Hansen, (a 20 year old actress playing a 14 year old character)....this movie just has nothing to offer. It just kinds of meanders until its very predictable, very unsatisfying conclusion."
" Beautiful Copenhagen
",0.5994,-0.1027,2020-07-27 00:00:00,8,"Copenhagen has that wonderful Indie Film slow pace, that allows to explore its geography and lets it influence the characters in surprising and sometimes controversial ways.If you are looking for a film that leaves you with that wondrous and young uncertainty that we seem to lose as we grow older, this is the film for you.And above that Gethin Anthony gives a wonderful, torn and heartbreaking performance that feels equally grounded and hypnotising."

" Copenhagen: Entertaining !
",0.4926,0.8913,2019-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Copenhagen is a catching story.It's a very pleasant film and the Author (Mark Raso, a very talented young filmmaker: this is his first / debut feature film...) seems perfectly aware that the best thing you can do, as an artist, is to entertain.The movie is an hour and a half of youthful wandering through Denmark, without any dull or dead moments, filmed with very good taste (and very good acting).Of course I noticed that (as stated in the synopsis) the girl is younger than the boy. But this is hardly the main theme.Actually you can find many things in the movie, from sex addiction to finding-your-roots, but these (on my opinion) are just as the canvas on which the writer made his characters act.Enjoy."
" First minutes are terrible, lots of film tropes
",-0.4767,0.7906,2019-05-17 00:00:00,8,"And then lead actor understands that character has to stop being so cheap, that is it. Get's better. Good movie. Worth to watch, specially, if you like/wants to like Denmark."
" Wrong choice for the lead
",-0.4767,0.8628,2019-04-15 00:00:00,6,"Copenhagen is a nice little movie. And actually would be a really good one if it wasn't for the male lead Gethin Anthony. I was shocked that he actually is a trained actor because his acting his horrendous. I have no other word for it. For the whole movie he is simply not capable of delivering any kind of emotion. I never one second believe his bad boy stick. His facials, his attempts to deliver dialogue are so cringe worthy. Wait till you get to the scene with him on a payphone. I literally buried my face in my blanket.Frederikke Dahl Hansen on the other hand is the exact opposite. You immediately know that acting comes natural to her and even when she has moments where she seems not really sure how to deliver a certain line you can tell that this is just a matter of experience. She and the beautiful scenery makes this movie worth wile. With a better male actor it could have been so much more."
" Lead actor is amazing
",0.5859,0.8879,2019-04-01 00:00:00,10,"Don't get me wrong, it's a powerful story and a beautiful film, but for me, Gethin Anthony shines throughout the movie. Loved it. 10/10."
" Copenhagen sequel

" first, I liked the film. Second, does no one else see?
",0.1531,0.9181,2018-06-17 00:00:00,8,"Don't get me wrong, I liked this film. Interesting characters, interesting plot. When we find out that Effy is 14, it's rather shocking, but then, not shocking. She's so young in her way of dealing with William. So we see them drinking, in clubs, etc., and this girl is only 14. She also seems quite comfortable, and I use that word loosely here, getting involved with William, emotionally of course, but also physically. So what is going on with her? The introduction of Henrik in the middle of the movie pretty much cemented it for me. His ""protection"" of her seemed a bit intense. And then, when she goes home and he's there, the last thing she says to Henrik is ""I'm telling mom."" Hello?!?!? It was fairly obvious that this poor girl has been abused by this man. yes, she's looking for an older man figure in William, but she's a confused 14 year old treated badly by none other than her mother's boyfriend. LIke I said, I liked this movie. But I'm a bit chagrined that many of the other reviews were mostly enthralled by this lovely young woman-as they should be-but did not see the dark underside of it as well."
" Looking for Relatives
",0.0,-0.7128,2018-04-17 00:00:00,6,"An interesting story, however, demonstrates how an American should not present himself when visiting Europe. Maybe this is where we get the terminology, ""ugly American."" If not ugly, certainly immature."
" Such a Journey and One I Cared About
",0.4215,0.9196,2018-04-12 00:00:00,8,"As an actor myself, you see films where you just don't care about the obstacles and challenges of the characters'. With Copenhagen, one of those little gems you find every so often on Netflix (NZ in this case), I was emotionally invested in all the main characters'. Self discovery in abundance here, particularly with Will (Gethin Anthony), who succumbs to the charms of 14 year old 'Effy', touchingly portrayed by Frederikke Dahl Hansen. I'm sure she has a bright career ahead of her. Poignant moments' of familial connection (or lack of) draws the viewer in against the picturesque backdrop of Denmark. A real discovery to find the principal males', Will and Jeremy (Sebastian Armesto) are both English. I am so glad I stumbled across this beautiful piece of film-making. It is a piece of hope, regret and ultimately, a reminder of how life is too short and that sometimes, it takes someone else to open our eyes to the possibilities."
" Beautiful film
",0.5994,0.968,2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"I watched this film some time ago, and the reviews are largely very positive, but I wanted to add my rating and comments in the hope that more will watch this film. We have Effie from Copenhagen, fourteen going on twenty, who helps a rude, immature Will from the USA on a visit to find his Danish roots and have 'fun' in the process. What makes this film special is the superlative acting, the pace and the juxtaposition of an immature adult man bonding with a wise and well balanced Danish girl of just fourteen years of age. Many of the reviews regarding this film state that it left a lasting impression on them, and I can see why. Treat yourself and watch this film."
" Not a typical review.
",0.0,0.998,2017-06-24 00:00:00,9,"William.... a total douchebag.... but getting to learn more about his life changed the way I felt about him. Gethin Anthony plays his character like he is the same person in real life, so obviously a plus for this movie. When your friend proposes his girlfriend, what's the first thing you think of? (Oh, well... good for you mate, I am really happy for you). William directly disapproves his decision, mainly because he doesn't like her, however he doesn't know her really well. The point of William's visit to Copenhagen was finding his only family... his grandfather who turns out to be a douchebag too. Actually, his father was one too. The visit turns upside down because Jeremy thought it would be a good place to propose, then he left his bestfriend all alone in a foreign city. This is where the journey of the douchebag (who turns out to be a really good guy, but without affection from his family) starts. I always wanted to visit a city all alone and I thought William just had the chance to discover if (quote from the movie) ""you are the kind of person you can lean on when you are all alone, with no friends, no family to lean"" I think the moment he met Effy, he started to realise what kind of person he is. It is funny how a total stranger can change your point of view in just a day. William is not the kind of man to talk about his life or feelings, but then again, a stranger, a 14 year old girl changed him. Maybe not so much, but just to start him on the right track. Also, (Frederikke Dahl Hansen) found herself, or started to see life a lot more beautiful when she met William. She knew that being a teenager could affect their relationship, still she created a bond with him that I think will last for ages even if they don't meet again. A thing I loved about this movie was the way Copenhagen was filmed. The scenery of the beautiful city which was shown in the movie made me instantly want to visit it (you know the feeling of starting to fall in love with places you have never been). Mark Raso and Alan Poon did an impressive job with this film. You actually feel like getting lost in the city (I can assure you that the feeling gets real when you will watch this movie). The relationship between two strangers also helps with the scenery. I had no subtitles when they talked in danish, so for a few minutes I was in William's pants. Especially the part when he talked to his uncle and I can say that it is awful not knowing what they are talking. I liked the ending a lot (maybe just because of my interpretation of it). William went to Skagen to meet his grandfather, where he realised that his relative is exactly like his father. There he went to the beach. The place where the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet. I think that, metaphorically, that place depicted his days in Copenhagen, where the doucheness met his kindness. The scene was mixed with Effy being at school because she is the one that managed to get his kindness out of him. And the important thing, I think that William knew that. He knew that it was time to grow up, even though falling in love with a girl half your age clearly means it is time to grow up. He knew that a new start is the best for him. Why this is not a typical review? Just because this movie is not typical (you will see why when you will watch the movie)."
" Warm, interesting movie for long summer nights
",0.5574,0.9973,2017-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Really enjoyed this little movie. It's not a complicated nor far-fetched story line and when I read the summary before seeing the film I was wondering if it wouldn't be too simple... This movie shows that you don't need overly complicated story lines to make an intriguing film.As the title says, it really is an ode to Copenhagen. I must visit soon, it looks like a beautiful, free and modern city. Put it on my bucket list. Really. Go there, it looks awesome.Although some reviewers didn't like the William character, I completely believed his change in attitude and lifestyle. Tthe self-obsessed, vile man-child changing into a compassionate, protective and gentler human being is being played very well by the actor Gething Anthony. Praising the Danish actress for her role is easier because she plays a sweet, naive-but-wise, vulnerable girl. She acts great and I loved her, but I cannot says this without mentioning her male co-player.Some things in the movie I didn't like? Sure. Obnoxiuous William having a best friend for 20 years...? That friend returning to Copenhagen after whisking off to London (why London?) all in the same day? I found this Jeremy character unnecessary. I believe William's character was strong and rounded enough without the addition of a best friend. He annoyed me, their 'friendship' annoyed me. Another character in the movie that didn't have to be added was that of Effy's stepfather Henrik. The audience already got a glimpse of her life (always out, no rules, stealing, entering without admission) to know that her home situation must be difficult. Like Jeremy, the movie didn't need Henrik to clarify Effy's character. I think it would have worked fine if it had focused on the protagonists alone and have Jeremy and Henrik be side notes like they did with Effy's uncle, or the barkeeper, etc.I liked the ending, I was afraid it would turn out differently but it didn't. Especially liked the fact that William made the trip to Skagen and came to terms with his past... AND his future. That last shot left me with a great big, satisfying sigh. I really hope their lives went well (and yes, I KNOW it's only a movie)."
" You, me & Copenhagen
",0.0,0.9898,2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"There are three protagonists in the story of Copenhagen: William, Effy and the city. There are many city specific romance films dedicated to London, Paris or New York but there is a quaint charm in bicycles and in that regard, Copenhagen-the city of bicycles, fits really well to the narrative. William is an American/Canadian tourist on an adventurous bender across Europe with his best friend Jeremy and his tag along girlfriend, whom William detests. On his to-do list is to deliver a letter from his father to its rightful owner. When left neglected by his best friend who promptly leaves William behind in Copenhagen, the letter gathers importance for him, who is otherwise content being inconsiderate and childish to everyone around him- including Effy, a teenage waitress at the hotel where William has checked in. Unable to read the contents of the letter, William asks Effy for help who commits to tracking the recipient of the letter, William's grandfather. One of the most touching moments in the film is when William learns that he is the grandson of a Nazi corroborator. His father who had abandoned him was also left abandoned by his own father. The familiarity of this desertion is genetic. Seated in a quiet room of a distant relative, there is no one except Effy, a stranger then, who gets William's predicament. Imagine William's state of mind when he finds out that Effy, who has been part of this intimate, shocking discovery and whom William seems to grow fond of, is underage. The rest of the film delves into William's own sense of discipline and morality and Effy's discovery of a childhood she never had. Effy, brilliantly played by Hansen is at moments vulnerable, effervescent, spontaneous, and more perceptive than William, who even in his late twenties seems to behave like a moody, cantankerous, entitled, teenage boy. Her 'resting bitch face' to William's off brand sexist humor is brilliant. The bicycle rides in the film open up vistas of cobbled alleyways, brightly colored apartment blocks, flirtatious and honest banter between the two, and moments of interlude in the story. The second most touching moment of the film is when William takes Effy to a club and in a rush of emotion blurts out that he loves her. Gethin Anthony does a fine job playing a man so overcome with this alien realization that he doesn't know how to mend himself better to express this. This is followed by a childish game of 'shark attack'. Effy returns the sentiments later in the film reclined in William's hotel bed. Her confession is soft, hesitant perhaps, as it's quickly followed by ""you told me you loved me already"". She tries to seduce William but here is when we see how much William has matured through the course of the film. It is in the same hotel room that he had previously had his one night stands, the same room where he had broken his laptop screen in a fit of rage- unable to decipher his father's letter, the same room where he once lay despondent, staring at the ceiling for clues. The film ends with William at Skagen, point of confluence of the Baltic and North Sea. The metaphor for a perfect relationship- ""you look to the left and you look to the right, and both seas are there. And they can meet in the middle, but they never lose themselves in each other. They are always themselves no matter what""- Effy."
" A wonderful visual experience with powerful performances
",0.7579,0.9893,2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"I had high hopes and expectations when I first found this film on here, that I watched on the very same day (which I never do). My expectations were so high that I was convinced this film wouldn't meet them but boy, I was wrong.The city of Copenhagen turned out to be the best setting for this romantic film. It was refreshing to see a movie filmed somewhere other than the usual filming locations and this one made me appreciate Denmark a little bit more.The directing, the casting, the cinematography and the music, all add up and lead to the most majestic experience you could ever gain by watching a film. It made me want to travel abroad and date a foreigner, learn about their culture and gave me a very feeling of wanderlust.It's true that, in the beginning, I thought Frederikke Dahl Hansen was not a great actress, but that proved to be just the way her character is supposed to act because she feels kind of guilty, kind of naive as a 14 year old. Gethin Anthony was very sexy and very romantic at the same time, in his own ex-douche bag way but both actors delivered a wonderful performance.I also liked the fact that this film features a big age gap, let alone an age gap between an adult and a teenager. Needless to say, dating an underage person is a controversial topic but this film handled it very well.10/10 though I wish I could give it more. It's a must see."
" Romance with the uneasiness of a slasher movie
",0.25,0.9965,2017-04-18 00:00:00,9,"I was not surprised to find out that this film was by a new Canadian director, Mark Raso. The film had a Canadian feel to it, which for my experience is simply low on flash and high on sub-context and texture. The city of Copenhagen provides a rich back-drop that immediately sets you a bit off balance where you are not entirely sure what is normal and OK. The story line is fairly simplistic; Obnoxious man-child finally meets the girl that makes him grow-up. However, what is so delicious about this movie is the dance between temptation and morality. The budding relationship between William and Effy is awkward, yet irresistible. Effy, masterfully played by Frederikke Dahl Hansen, is both innocent and desirable. She has the beauty worthy of ancient art work and an incredible sweetness. She is the lure that nurtures the growth of William. He is instantly unlikable, but she forces him to tread lightly. He is immediately draw to her, but is also cautious. While the truth about her is slowly revealed, he tries to create distance and perspective, but the gravity of her attraction is powerful and so they start to revolve around each other. The scenes become like a train wreck in slow motion. The crash has become obvious, but inevitable. So, while we brace for impact, we are also sucked in and can't look away.The delicate part of the dance is that as Effy intensifies her advances, William is maturing. He never seems to pursue her, but seems unable to resist her. He motivation seems more honest. She has abandonment issues and is desperate for someone to love her. So, once she begins to engage with William, she becomes somewhat compelled to gain his acceptance. Because her need is not sexual, but emotional, it is deeper, slower, more constant and intense. The moral dilemma for William is simple, so it allows him to easily disregard all of his previous views of women and become more genuine. The brilliance, is how slowly the relationship progresses. We see her sing to him and watch him defend her. We see him turn a blind eye to a sexual fantasy, just to be with her. So, when they kiss on the dance floor, we are wrapped up in the moment. The back drop of Copenhagen, where the age of consent is only 15, blurs the lines of right and wrong. While a 28 year old kissing a 14 year old is clearly wrong, you can't help but cheer for it.The dance reaches its pinnacle when Effy removes her top in an attempt to become completely sexual, only for William to finally mature into the protector and cover her. The undertone story arcs close off nicely as William visits the place where the two seas meet to demonstrate that he has learned the meaning of true relationships and Effy gained the acceptance of a father figure. The audience comes out of the dance with relief as the movie ends with Effy's head in her mother's lap showing that through all of this, she retailed her innocence."
" Frederikke Dahl Hansen was a treasure! The English-speaking cast sucked
",-0.2714,-0.9891,2017-04-16 00:00:00,4,"First - Frederikke Dahl Hansen was wondrous. Sort of a Danish young Jennifer Lawrence. Magical - great career ahead of her!Gethin Anthony's character was rude, selfish, and very much like a spoiled two year-old throwing his darkest tantrum. My first reaction was - Dude, how could you do such a cliché of Americans?As his acting-out continued I was nagged by a strange sensation - his whole shtick rang false. It was too frenetic, too strained and hyper. Then I looked him up on IMDb and saw that he is not American at all, but in fact English. His character's pal is an English actor too. And the so-called writer/director, Raso, is also not American - he's Canadian.I find these young hipster prima donnas' appropriation of my culture and ethnicity offensive. If they want to be self-obsessed, snotty little narcissists, that's their choice. But they have no right - either artistically or ethically, to be dicks in MY name, as it were. How dare they pretend to be of another culture, only to sabotage and besmirch that culture from their disguise? That's dishonest to say the least. If they have a beef with Americans they should man-up and come right out and say it. Be known for who you are, dudes! They should use their own damn identity to defame the human condition, to befoul our waters. They should not hide by doing it by masquerading their intent and their ""bona fides."" Actors pretend, yes, but we also expect an authenticity of the artist. These clowns had none.This movie had so many exciting premises that promised a great indie gem. Instead, it misfired on most of them, and the result is rather a mess. Its worst sin, however, was not dropping the ball (that is to be forgiven in a first-time indie director), but rather in the clumsy ugliness of the male characters. More than merely having no redeeming qualities, the males here also gave me the creeps, and left me with a psychic sludge that was a bit painful.THAT was just bad manners on director Mark Raso's part."
" Mature Film About Immaturity
",0.4215,0.9962,2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Denmark. Ever since I chose it for a report in the seventh grade, it has been at the top of my countries to visit list. As for the film? A great one that illustrates not only how sometimes the best relationships transcend age and language barriers, but also how they do not necessarily have to involve sex or last forever. Better said by one of my favorite poems, author unknown: ""A Reason, A Season, A Lifetime"" People come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. When you figure out which one it is, you will know what to do for each person. When someone is in your life for a reason, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty; to provide you with guidance and support; to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled; their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move on. Some people come into your life for a season, because your turn has come to share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it. It is real. But only for a season Lifetime relationships teach you lifetime lessons; things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant."
" It has its' moments... But.
",0.0,0.5786,2017-03-09 00:00:00,4,"I'd wager that I would have scored this lower if not for the visuals. I love Copenhagen, been many times and grow to love it more each time. In fact, that's pretty much why I decided to watch this one, because I love the city so much. However, outside of that, the film doesn't offer much more more. The controversial plot twist, I'll admit I did not see it coming. But I didn't find it engaging. It just made me grow more fed up with the main character who is almost instantly unlikable and doesn't improve despite the attempts of the film. In fact none of the characters are overly engaging, there is zero attachment to any of them. What a shame, some of the most interesting people I've ever come across were met in Copenhagen. The plot itself isn't bad, it's just not done well. Many of the plot developments happen all too conveniently without any engaging material to link them e.g. them finding the main characters father's name carved on the apartment floor within about fifteen seconds of arriving from thin air, then of course Effy's uncle just happens to work at a national statistics database to track him down. It's rushed, and dull. Can't really talk up the acting that accompanies all this as well.However, I obviously was invested enough to sit through to the end, so I wouldn't say it's the worst film I've reviewed... not even close. It has moments, not very many but some, the scene where he confronts his Grandfather is an engaging example. Overall, it has great potential, but it's executed poorly. I do know of people that like it, but it's just not for me.P.S. Go visit Copenhagen, it's awesome."
" 'Copenhagen' Takes Love to Dark Places
",0.6369,-0.9923,2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,"It took me a few days to process the movie Copenhagen, which took home the Director's Choice Award for Best Feature – Drama from the Sedona International Film Festival. The movie held my interest and piqued my curiosity but left me feeling a little dirty.It tells its story from the perspective of 20-something American tourist William. After a buddy trip to Europe is sabotaged by his friend's manipulative girlfriend, he finds himself in the Danish capital alone and angry.There is only one thing on his ""to-do"" list – find his grandfather, about whom he knows nothing, and deliver a letter from his late father. It's not a done deal, either. All he has is a very old address.Played by British actor Gethin Anthony, William is not looking forward to this errand. For him, the trip always was about getting laid. While he stews in the hotel lobby, he spies a blonde walking outside. The next morning, she winds up being his waitress in the hotel café.Things get messy when she spills coffee on the envelope, blurring the address. He berates her until she says she got a look at the address and remembers it. Suddenly, he needs her help, but it's hard for him to shift gears from nasty to nice.He pays the price, as Effy (20-year-old Copenhagen native Frederikke Dahl Hansen) sends him on a wild goose chase. Later that day, he finds her hanging out near the hotel and confronts her. A bit sheepish, she says she'll take him to the correct address. When they get there, they find not William's grandfather but the man's brother.It's not a happy homecoming. Uncle Peter is hospitable enough but tells William that his grandfather was a terrible man – a Nazi collaborator who was imprisoned after the war and later disappeared. His wife, shunned in Danish society, had emigrated to America with her young son.The uncle gives William some black-and-white photos of his father as a boy. Over the next couple of days, Effy leads William to the places where the photos were taken, snapping pictures of him striking the same poses as his father. Over the course of the visits, we find out that William's father had abandoned his family when William was a boy.The Baby Elephant in the RoomHow does Effy find so much time for William? She describes her hotel job as a sort of internship, part of her school's curriculum. He assumes – or at least tells himself – that she is a college student, yet he doesn't try to bed her instantly as he has every other nubile woman since we met him.Despite her frequent claims that she needs to get home, she never actually goes. One starts to get a creepy feeling. Is she hiding from a hellish home life? Does she even have a home? (She never seems to change clothes.) She does make a vaguely negative reference to her mother's boyfriend; is he forcing himself on her or pimping her out?Eventually, she reveals that she's only 14 years old. That's when things get really creepy, because by this time moviegoers are invested in their developing relationship.Confronting RealityAround this time, the voice of reason arrives when William's erstwhile travel buddy, Jeremy (Sebastian Armesto), returns to Copenhagen, having been dumped by the girlfriend in London. The attention Effy gives to Jeremy makes William jealous, leading to an argument during which Jeremy learns the truth about Effy and calls them out.To William: ""Nobody likes you. You connect with teenagers.""To Effy: ""He's that stranger you're not supposed to talk to.""When the men start to scuffle, Effy flees. Jeremy storms off, leaving William alone once again.After a couple of pathetic conversations with Effy's voicemail, William heads out to a nightclub, where the film takes on a shadowy, race-against-the-night quality. He's about to score a threesome with two American girls – a home run for pre-Copenhagen William – when Effy turns up, having finally listened to his messages. He walks away from the Americans to focus on Effy. Is this a sign of progress for William?Some of the club staff greet Effy with familiarity, raising more questions about her lifestyle now that we know her age. Another man at the bar recognizes her and drags her out. William pursues and forces the man to let her go. As they flee, Effy tells William it was her mother's boyfriend.A brief stop at Effy's home to get her laptop reveals little, though the darkened apartment certainly doesn't convey a happy home life. Effy's mom emerges when her boyfriend arrives, but they are too focused on each other to notice Effy and William sneaking out.By this point, William and Effy have admitted their romantic feelings for each other. Back in his hotel room, they begin to act on their hormones.With a normal movie romance, the audience usually roots for the couple to  couple. But given the characters' ages, we are left to squirm as they start disrobing. Will they ignore the elephant in the room and consummate their fantasy relationship? Or will William acknowledge that, as the movie's website puts it: ""When the girl of your dreams is half your age, it's time to grow up.""There are two epilogues to Copenhagen, both of which take place in the light of day. William makes a final effort to locate his grandfather and learn why the males in his family are so screwed up. We see Effy, looking and behaving very much like a teenager, waiting in class to present a report including photos she took of William – and curling up with her mother on a couch at home."
" A credible film, but could have been incredible
",0.0,0.9953,2017-02-19 00:00:00,6,"The first thing I should say outright is that the performance of Frederikke Dahl Hansen was completely enrapturing - and ultimately, she was the star of the film. Far more likable in character than her co-star, to the point you almost feel like the film would have been better centred with the main plot around her, rather than Gethin Anthony's character. I feel like the plot itself was OK, with family ties being sought by two very different characters midst the beautiful backdrop of Copenhagen. The problem was that the male lead's character was fairly detestable, and that led to a lack of sympathy from me as the viewer with his back story. Towards the end there were signs of some redemption in his own behaviour as he starts to care about Effy. However I think the writers should have softened his character more to make the audience feel a bit more connected to him. This is why I have scored a 6 as he is a key part of the film and I truly think that his characterisation was off beam. I understand his lack of maturity is one of the key elements of the character (to fit in with his relationship with Effy), but this needn't have been done in such a coarse way.The above said, the film is absolutely worth watching. Dahl Hansen produces a superb performance combining both a wisdom beyond her 14 yr old life, with a hint of teenage naivety that sees her attach to William. I also think whilst Gethin Anthony's character isn't very likable, he does gel well with Dahl Hansen and we see some great scenes that are very memorable; the Karaoke scene, the awkward discovery of her age and the theme park ride among them. There is a gorgeous scene when we see them cycling the streets of Copenhagen (with the possibly underused Jeremy character) that is verging on euphoria. I've not been to Copenhagen, but seeing this film has definitely made me want to go.So 6 out of 10 is my final score. With a better written lead male, this could have been a 9 or 10. On the topic of the underage aspect, the film addresses this fairly well and shows that it is not unduly bypassing it. We are somewhat led to believe that their companionship has transcended their ages, with the dangers of that relationship highlighted well in the row scene between William and Jeremy - one of the more interesting scenes with the two male characters involved. So go see it, but see if like me you feel one half of the critical relationship just needed re-configuring."
" Independent movie as it's best
",0.6369,0.7689,2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"When I picked up this movie, I thought how two different age people touring around Copenhagen looking for someone can be interesting for 90+ mins. However, I never felt bored with the whole movie. In fact, the movie draws my attention so deep that you feel you are in their situation. The movie also shows how truly beautiful Copenhagen is.True talents to both characters but the real gem is how the director/writer crafted those intriguing small talks between them. This movie is an art."
" Compelling Soul journey
",0.2263,0.9718,2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"You'll probably read a lot of the other reviews here for this movie. So I'm not going to rehash the story line.It's a simple story of two souls who discover and guide each other over 24 hours together in Copenhagen. It has definite similarities to Rich Linklater's Before Sunrise (another of my favourites) but where it differs is in the mismatch in the two's age and maturity.Here Effy (played by the amazing Frederikke Dahl Hansen) is only 14 years old, and William (Gethin Anthony) is in his late twenties. However it's Effy the 'teenager' who guides William on his journey to discover his family (and himself as a man in the process). The soul journey and connection between this women-like teenage girl and this boy-like grown-up man is compelling. A must watch, not only for the chemistry between these two, but also the beauty of Copenhagen. Loved it. You will too."
" Avoid
",-0.296,-0.9049,2017-01-15 00:00:00,2,"Unbelievably arrogant, rude, offensive, irresponsible, self-centered, American dick-bag goes to Copenhagen expecting everyone to fall over themselves to help him find his estranged grandpa as he throws tantrums, litters the streets and canal. The writer/director seem to want to normalize this obscene behavior while encouraging pedophilia. This is an embarrassment to independent filmmakers and shows what happens when talent-less spoiled brats get funding. The actors and cinematic crew are the only talent here. It's hard to imagine why this film was made and what possible message they were going for. Five minutes into the film and I was hoping the main character would be hit by a bus. By the end of the film my feelings hadn't changed."
