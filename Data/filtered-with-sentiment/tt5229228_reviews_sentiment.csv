" Confusion
",-0.296,0.6035,2020-09-22 00:00:00,6,"A very interesting movie that try to attract both rightists with a lot of religious elements depicted and leftists with the main character turning into one of them in the end. This is kinda oriental cunning that gives me confusion and that might be the result of the polarized society that we have today. But then again, this society has always been polarized but haven't noticed that this much till today. I enjoyed the movie overall and i don't wanna be such a simpleton as to say hey pick your side but aspiring to both sides at the same time, i don't know. Simply i didn't like it."
" A must watch
",0.0,0.7644,2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"I was almost going to give 10 if transition to drama from comedy was smoother toward to end. One relates too much in this movie, you do not have to be Turkish, if you struggled in your childhood to find your identity between religion, political environment, social class, you can find something from you in this child. Its an amazing movie, used all components affecting children's identity forming using background of 70s Turkey. Especially towards to end, there are many tragicomic instances, including fasting and hunger strike, 61 days; showing religion, politics, society wrapped all together. To sum up, this movie is a great manifestation of life!"
" A Masterpiece Which Tells the Story of the Ongoing Struggle
",0.4215,0.9917,2019-06-17 00:00:00,10,"I was born in the infamous year 1984, which is the name of the Orwell's book that tells us about the facism at its prime. In turn, a bitter coincidence brought us the present day where most of the human values are getting erased from the existance, primarily in countries like us, but generally in everywhere. So oh, you tell me is this movie important for me.Iftarlik Gazoz is a movie which tells our story from the heart. This is at its core is Turkey with struggles between the right wing that always seeks power and status quo and the left wing (most of it except radicalists) seeks solutions such as education to lift the country to an upper level. I for one who loves political stand points so if you are one of us you'll most definately love this.Eventhough the main plot is the struggle between the leftist and rightists, the movie revolves around the young boy who observes and experiences the world from his own mind resolutions. That brings us to the fact that the country, Turkey once a very naive and peaceful place in which people were very friendly to each other despite the differences. Once upon a time a master was really a half-father and before caring about her/his profit, she/he was caring her/his apprantice, mostly for the fact that she/he was a child at that time. People might not be very well educated, but they had compassion and morale values. Even religion was not so religilous as much as our time.This movie has novelty even if it tells a story which belongs to the old Turkey. Its novelty is in its language, music, acting and sincerity. One of the best movies alongside with Eskiya, Babam ve Oglum and Propaganda. It left my wife and me crying loudly for minutes after it ends. It surely is a must watch."
" Ibelive to when you watch it you will be cry.
",-0.4767,-0.5574,2019-05-29 00:00:00,8,It is has not only hallucinating on Ramadan.It has died a lots of people by political and social arques in Turkey at 1970s.And you should be watch this film.
" Comedy or Drama?
",0.3612,0.9321,2017-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Once heard Cem Yilmaz is starring I expected somewhat comedy, like GORA and Yahsi Bati, it was so though, until last ten percent. It suddenly turned into hard drama. I don't understand who the target audience are? Comedy lovers or drama addicts? Anyway, scenery, Aegean village, farmers, tobacco fields, spring, lulaby, open-air cinema were so nice. When compared with Ottoman period TV series scenery was far better, which are just composed of a bunch of Belgrade Forest and pompous costumes. But I felt like I was in the 1970's while watching it. Just a moment I thought the topic is just about a child's weird tides in Ramadan. In animation part, ant's ""I'll die on my way"" catchword was so clich√©. I expected something more deep. Mosque scenes were unnecessarily long. Some players imitated pretty well Aegean sweet accent while others mucked up. Some latent messages were splattered through movie, especially on contrast with ordinary villagers and scholar boy, Hasan. Cibar Kemal resembles Iskender in Hokkabaz in many ways."
" This Movie Brought me My Childhood
",0.0,0.8511,2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,"I was born in 1993. I did not live in 70's-80's but i heard, read and watched so many stories about it. I'm not from Aegean Region. I was born and living in Ankara in Central Anatolia Region. These two regions have different types of people and day life. But this movie brought me my childhood. Made me smile. Ending scenes of movie made me almost cry. Maybe people who out of Turkey, cannot understand but we will. We'll cry for who are our lost before. Good project, good acting, good script, good directing. This movie deserves 10 out of 10."
