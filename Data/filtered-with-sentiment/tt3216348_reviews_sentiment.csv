" It's Alright
",0.25,0.7809,2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"The film is worth a one time viewing, nothing too special or original about it. Though I always enjoy watching Eckhart act, he usually gives it his all even in a film like this. The thing I did like is the way the possessed victims live in a fantasy world while the demon controls their body."
" Slow and predictable
",0.0,0.7227,2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie was okay- it followed the possession type movie formula. It didn't have enough to be memorable but premise was new to me. I guess besides like Insidious etc but it still felt unique. It fell because there was too little, predictably timed. An okay movie but won't watch again unless trying to fall asleep."
" Predictable AF

" Ehh...
",0.0,0.0,2021-01-30 00:00:00,4,Good until the end. There is a lot of build up and then it ends disappointingly. There is also a bit of over acting. I think this was contracted from christian bale in the dark knight
" Better than most
",0.4404,0.9278,2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,"I have pretty low expectations these days with possession films, so many of them are not worth the time. Incarnate, however was a definite improvement and better than I had hoped.It does have some flaws, I think using a kid as the vehicle (not the actor) was a mistake, it made for some cringe worthy cliched moments and the ending could have been better.Overall though they had a nice concept to work with and they provided a better than average result."
" The movie tries to be Inception by way of The Exorcist, but ends up coming far short of either.
",0.0,-0.8461,2020-12-23 00:00:00,4,"Ember (Aaron Eckhart) is an unconventional exorcist who performs what he calls ""evictions"" by diving into the minds of the possessed. When the Catholic Church approaches him to exorcise a possessed boy (David Mazouz), he initially refuses until he learns the possessor may be the same spirit that killed his family and left him confined to a wheelchair.One of many films to come from economically minded film production company Blumhouse(Paranormal Activity, Sinister, The Purge) Incarnate is at first glance an intriguing premise. Tackling the well trodden land of Exorcist/Exorcism themed horror that has been a staple of the genre since 1973's The Exorcist, the movie attempts to go a different route than usual for this type of movie, opting instead for an almost Sci-Fi approach to the material. Unfortunately the movie's reach exceeds its grasp and finds itself leaving very little impact and haphazardly borrowing from Inception and Exorcist without utilizing its borrowed parts very well.Brad Peyton's had experience in horror before with his 2002 short film Evelyn: The Cutest Evil Dead Girl being reasonably well received, but when looking at his most recent works, San Andreas, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, and Rampage, his work is primary in effects heavy action films so he's not exactly the best person to approach this material. Unfortunately Peyton doesn't know how to approach this kind of material on such a frugal budget, so the sequences in the real world and the ""minds"" of the possessed are very flat and aren't visually interesting.Aaron Eckhart does what's expected of him, but there's not much there for the character so its unfortunately not one of his better performances. Not bad mind you, but nowhere near the heights we know Eckhart to be capable of. David Mazouz is passable if unexceptional, and everyone else just sort of fills a point that's expected. The movie doesn't have any internal consistency (particularly a plot point of jumping out a window that seems ignored when it would otherwise jeopardize that PG-13 rating) and there's not much in the screenplay to draw in the viewer because it present its borrowed parts so matter of factly with very little twists on them.Incarnate is a disappointing movie, what starts as an intriguing mashup of Exorcist and Inception basically devolves into a less visually interesting version of Dreamscape that takes itself overly seriously, is lacking in humor, and can't even leave a lasting impact. A unique enough idea is executed with little drive and enthusiasm."

" This could have been awesome
",0.6249,-0.9738,2020-12-22 00:00:00,5,"The plot: a bitter scientist who can enter other people's dreams becomes an exorcist to hunt down the demon that killed his family.If you're a fan of Aaron Eckhart, how could you not find this concept exciting? The problem is that the film gives you all kinds of promises and fails to deliver on any of them. Every step of the way, you're left thinking to yourself, ""This movie could have been awesome."" With such an over-the-top, absurd premise, you could have really gone crazy. Instead, it's by-the-numbers.The dream sequences in particular could have been memorable. Remember The Cell by Tarsem Singh? That wasn't a great movie, but the dream sequences were great. Imagine what someone like David Cronenberg could have done with this concept! Instead, what do we get? A generic nightclub. A generic carnival. A generic park. When music videos from the 1990s look more visionary -- and disturbing -- than your horror movie, that's a problem.Perhaps one of the more perplexing aspects of the story is that our hero rejects spiritual mumbo jumbo when it comes to demons, but he uses psychic powers to fight them. I suspect this was done to explain why he must fight the demons personally. But given that he's already obsessed with vengeance, why can't that be enough? Why does he also need superpowers?The story is OK, but it often feels like it could have been so much more. Despite throwing several interesting ideas at you, it never rises above the pedestrian elevator pitch: ""Fallen meets Inception"". However, it's not boring, which is truly the only unforgivable sin in a horror movie."
" Bad...

" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.3245,2020-12-17 00:00:00,3,"Incarnate is a plane that never really got off the ground.
Eckhart plays a crippled doctor who performs exorcisms (aka evictions) using an Inception-like method. His goal is to find the ""demon"" that killed his wife and kid in an auto accident, blah blah blah
The entire movie is a mash of other, much better movies in the hope it would result in something original (it did not).
When a 10 ur old kid gets possessed by the demon Eckhart has a major boner for, he takes the case, yards yadda
Obviously it's not as easy as it seems, but even that is predictable. Eckhart thinks he's gotten the demon out but it was a trick, instead it had jumped into his head. He drinks this magic blood that gives him 10 seconds of control back (but actually spends more like 30 seconds) climbing to a window where he falls to his death to kill himself and the demon.
Big surprise (not) he gets revived in the ambulance and the demon jumps into the hottie Latina chica from the Vatican...roll credits
I can't even call this a popcorn flick, because it was all SO derivative! The acting was ok, but the plot was erratic and predictable. The entire thing was really only about 15min worth of story that was stretched out for hours.
I had been looking forward to this coming to Netflix but after watching it, my eagerness was entirely misplaced."
" Too many plot devices
",0.0,0.468,2020-12-17 00:00:00,4,"This movie is Cell (Jennifer Lopez)+ Fallen(Denzel Washington) without having the style, writing or direction of either.The movie starts off well enough and engages your attention. Then everything slows to a crawl, jumps around without explaining much. The director or writer resorted to plot devices instead of writing a compelling conhesive story. There is very little horror and important scenes are done in darkness I guess to save on production costs(you can barely see what is going on at key points)."
" Unexpected
",0.0,0.9274,2020-12-16 00:00:00,7,The beginning hooked me and the presented story line kept me. I love demonic horror films and I was surprised to see it with this perspective. I'm more surprised that I didn't know about this movie until the end of 2020.

The plot isn't the same, but there are elements of it all over. It truly felt like a spiritual cousin of the show. Crazy, right?Anyway it was fine but it didn't hold my attention well."
" Fight the evil
",-0.7906,-0.3538,2020-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Fighting evil is always ... good. No pun intended. In this movie we have Aaron Eckhart in the main role and one of the Game of Thrones cast regulars as side dish. She really doesn't have that much to do here. A lot of cliches will be taken advantage of but that's how it is.The movie works overall even with a very high predictibility rate. There's blood, there are jump scares and there are things that have to happen, whether you agree with them or not ... like the omission of any logic at certain points"

" Creepy and eerie exorcism movie about an unbalanced scientific who has to save a kid from the claws a heinous demon
",0.1779,-0.9982,2019-08-12 00:00:00,6,"An acceptable watchable exorcism thriller but with some failures , gaps and flaws .

A wheelchair-bound scientist named Ember (Aaron Eckhart) , mentally ill for a car crash , must save the young boy from the grips of a demon with powers never seen before, while facing off the horrors of his past . In the waking world , Ember actually is limited and uses a wheelchair . Meanwhile, Dr. Seth Ember with the ability to enter the subconscious minds of the possessed approaches a man at a club and makes him realize he is dreaming . Later on , Ember deals with a Dutch mother Lindsey (Carice Van Houten) that is divorced from her drunk father Dan (Matt Nable) about the possessed son Cameron . The unhinged little boy is subsequently examined and possession is suspected , and the possession proves to be an ancient satanic force more powerful than ever imagined .There is something dark and sinister inside Cameron , a nasty demon that goes bersek and he wants to eject it .

Horrifying and terrifying images about a possessed kid by a malevolent and heinous spirit causing creepy , scary and terrible moments ; then , a doctor must do battle with an ancient satanic force to save the soul of the strange boy .

This latter movie remains still startling and engrossing with every viewing , it expanded countless sequels and imitations , one of them is this one , though , of course, it is far cry from the original Exorcist . Genuinely scary moments overcome some obvious plot devices . This is a juicy terrifying material fashioning an iconic diabolic possession, providing screams , thrills , shocks and chilling scenes . It has an extremely known premise that spawns the film in ups and downs . All semblance of plausibility is extracted , leaving a main cast of fine actors : Aaron Eckhart , David Mazouz , Carice van Houten , Catalina Sandino Moreno who replaced Rosario Dawson , to show their wide skills . The support cast is pretty good , such as : Keir O'Donnell ,Matt Nable, Emily Jackson, Tomas Arana , Paul Vincent O'Connor and Natalija Nogulich as the astonishing devil .It delivers a scary and eerie ambient thanks to an expert photographer , Dana Gonzales . As well as a frightening , suspenseful and chilling musical score by Andrew Lockington . Being efficiently produced by Jason Blum , Kaylene Carlson , Phillip Dawe and Brad Peyton himself . This non-sense , late night horror picture was decently directed by Brad Peyton , though with no originality and it has some flaws and gaps . Brad Peyton is a good writer , producer and filmmaker who has directed a few acceptable films , such as : ¨San Andres¨ , ¨Journey 2: The Mysterious Island¨, ¨Project Rampage¨ . Rating : 6/10 .

" Interesting story, poor pacing
",-0.1027,-0.4179,2019-05-20 00:00:00,6,"They had a lot of good ideas here, but the execution somewhat ruins the experience. The premise is really interesting, the characters are well played, and the dialogue is decent. The story somewhat fails in that it tried to go in too many directions (sci-if, action) when it should have just stuck hard to horror. It is worth a look as a Sunday afternoon/sick-day free-flick."
" A decent offering, worthy of a night in with a few beers.
",0.4404,0.5423,2019-04-05 00:00:00,7,"If you're looking for an action packed supernatural thriller that won't tax the the grey matter, this fits the bill. Aaron Eckhhart hams it up nicely as the ""exorcist"", and there are a few twists and turns to keep you on your toes.
It certainly warrants more than it's current rating, there are innumerable horror offerings that are much, much worse than this. Get the boys (or girls) round for a few drinks, and put this on. You'll easily keep up glancing at the screen in and amongst the conversation, and anything looks better with the aid of alcohol."
" If you liked Constantine, watch that again instead
",0.4215,-0.891,2018-11-24 00:00:00,4,"Aaron Eckhardt has done this kind of sad, broken father a hundred times before - he was better at it in Battle: Los Angeles. But watching him phone in this paraplegic reluctant exorcist version of the role is not worth the 90 or so minutes it takes to watch it. There's one great jump scar near the beginning and the rest is just tedious undercut nonsense. Watch Keanu Reeves in Constantine instead - he takes himself so seriously he suck you into believing in him too"

The plot was good. Production values, while not stellar, did their job. I was entertained, and will probably watch it again at some point."
" The biggest disappointment ever
",-0.5106,-0.9359,2018-07-20 00:00:00,1,I mean this movie was just terrible. I saw the previews for this movie almost a year before it came out. I was sooooo excited I kept checking the date to see when it came out... I even saved it on my calendar...every time a scary movie comes out I want that same scare the exorcist gave me years ago and I thought this was gonna be it...the movie had an awesome concept but the plot and the point was completely missed...the guy went into the boys' mind once and then everything else was all over the place...I was ready to see some scary stuff once he went into the little boys mind but no all we got was the boy with pale skin and black eyes and loud scary music whoever wrote this should be fired as a writer!
" Aaron Eckhart
",0.0,-0.3167,2018-07-13 00:00:00,3,"I swear that it looked like they were making up the script as they went. The movie is totally derivative, and Eckhart is at his very weakest."
" Terrific concept executed terribly.
",-0.128,0.1522,2018-06-30 00:00:00,5,This has a very interesting concept about evil/possession/exorcising within the subconscious realms and Aaron Eckhart puts everything he has into the character he plays. The horror cliches however are some of the worst I've seen. The unconvincing demonic effects like black/red eyes with pitiful cgi and the demonic voices that sound like funny drag queens are 2 of the dumbest aspects of this already very poorly written film. At least put more thought into your production value than what scares 5 yr olds. The twists are ridiculous and the scenes meant to be terrifying are laughably bad especially the one in the park. At least Overall this was a pretty abysmal film but Eckhart deserves some praise.
" Interesting idea, kinda well applied in the scenario, without the usual demonic possession cliche
",0.5434,-0.6085,2018-06-25 00:00:00,7,"I was very skeptical in seeing this movie, because in the last years all of the horror movies (except for few titles, and believe me, I devoured the horror genre since I started watching movies) were extremely disappointing, with a very generic scenario and lots of cliches, not to mention poor dialogues, lots of plot holes and so on. 
But today I decided to give this movie a chance, because the main idea of how the victims are ""exorcised"" got me intrigued. It was a pleasant surprise to not see the ordinary Bible, Holy water and prayers involved in an exorcism, but something that's rather scientific and psychological. The action is very intense, not because of jumpscares and loud soundtrack, but because of that intense psychological battle between Dr. Ember and the victims.At some point the scenario is even puzzling you as an audience, because you cannot tell which of the characters are in the real world and which ones are living the illusion within the possession.
As I don't want to give much spoilers about the movie, I can tell you that it is worth your time. It is not the mother of horror movies, but it brings a new idea for the whole possession concept."
" Most passive possession film I've ever seen.
",0.2716,0.6765,2018-06-18 00:00:00,2,"Some really intense scare scenes in the beginning, but ultimately the film is one of the less interesting possession films. Aaron Eckhart's character was the only active character in the fim, as the rest were very passive, including the demon Maggie. This demon simply sat waiting in a room the entire movie, and didn't really do anything. Once the boy was possessed within the first few minutes, the rest of the film became bland with no scares whatsoever. Matt Nable's character as the boy's father added a bit of interest, as well, but in general this was a dull and slow ride."
" Ripoff of another movie
",0.0,-0.1879,2018-05-21 00:00:00,4,"I can only imagine the people who are saying this concept is original must not watch many movies because the ending was predictable as possible, especially since it was pretty much the same ending as the movie Fallen with Denzel Washington. If you haven't seen it, the movie ends in the woods so the demon can't jump into someone else when it's finally dealt with, only to find out it jumped into a cat. Same thing here, don't touch him, don't touch him, ok, let everybody touch him now...poof, demon jumped. Really? No one was expecting that, huh? Right."
" Sloppy
",0.0,-0.8863,2018-04-23 00:00:00,5,"The demands for horror aren't high. You just want some scares and at least one likable character. This movie offers neither, so don't get fooled by the decent cast.Aaron Eckhart plays a man who has the ability to confront demons (parasites and illusions) inside people's minds. This is shown in the intro in an interesting way, that completely rips of Constantine and Inception, but Eckhart might be that likable guy.After that intro, the main story shows up, which is about a possessed (or infected) boy, with completely no background information or motivation. That parasite happens to be the same one that is responsible for the death of Eckharts family. The church motivates Eckhart to be the excorsist here, which is all the more reason for the boy's mother to complain that Eckhart does this only for himself. The mother is played by Carice van Houten and she acts as if she regrets being in this movie, being a cardboard character who hates her cardboard ex-husband and the kid is caught in the middle. Off course this is the strongest parasite ever, so the battle between Eckhart and the parasite begins, with more than just the boy at stake.Bad movies can easily be forgiven. Bad acting can be forgiven. Predictability can be forgiven. If at least a few scares and twists are present. But the predictability in this movie has risen to sky high so there is no effect here. Add to that the flat story and unlikable characters, and you have a stinker. Too bad because with a cast like this one, you'd expect a little better."

We learn the old tries and trues about demons but this goes a little farther in showing you how strong they are in deception, lies and beguilement of which they excel. Of course if you choose not to believe its game over (for the demon) of which this movie demonstrates quite well too. For those of you who get scared easily, take heart because we have an advocate that protects us and has destroyed the Kingdom of Hell and sentenced everything to doom starting now and up to the terrible day to come and everything in between. Next time you are feeling confused, doubtful, hesitation or despair know that you were not put here to be defeated but to prevail.

" An interesting exorcism film, with a few good moments.
",0.6808,0.9822,2017-11-12 00:00:00,7,"From the very get go, it started off fairly well, and similar to the Exorcist and other possession films. With the introduction of the lead family, followed by a kid getting possessed, then show the hero in a bad ass scene as he helps a possessed guy.Yeah, after that, it started going downhill for me. It wasn't really bad, per se, just very unrealistic. Mainly in terms of certain deaths, and how the cops were strangely absent, and no questions asked, etc. ""So... not one of you know how this guy died? Despite there being five of you, and a kid locked in a room? OK, sound logic."" In terms of acting, and cinematography, it was pretty good. Especially Aaron Eckhart as the gruff, wheelchair bound hero, Ember. He was likable as the character, and one of the reasons I even bothered to rate it a 7.Story-wise, I actually did like it. It had a good premise, just.... some parts were poorly executed. Kinda like if the Exorcist was put in the hands of a director who had no idea what the script was about. I do wonder what the writers were thinking half way through the movie: ""A toned down Exorcist with a hint of the Matrix? They'll totally buy that!"" You have a character able to traverse minds... in which a demon controls the host. And yet, the 'mind' sequences didn't have any horror in them? Blasphemy! I would've so had a Night of the Demons dream sequence if I wrote it! But the movie is good as something intense to watch while bored, or while you wait for another movie to come on, or while you wait for some popcorn to, er, pop. More of a thriller than an actual horror movie though. But if you enjoy predictable twist endings, a life-hating hero and a bar fight scene, then check it out."
" Different enough if still somewhat problematic
",-0.3832,0.5615,2017-10-23 00:00:00,7,"Attempting to locate a famed demon, an expert exorcist is called upon to determine the validity of a case involving a possessed young boy with ties to the demon he's hunting and begins a series of radical experiments to try to accomplish his mission before it kills him.This one ended up being a decent if not entirely original effort. What this one does well is the fact that there's a rather interesting and intriguing concept at the core of the film's premise. Rather than go for the straightforward idea of exorcism and rely on the traditional forms of chanting, prayer and such, this opts for a much more intriguing idea where the individual can go from the outside world into a person's dreams where they can fight the demonic possession in that manner which gives this a wholly interesting avenue to go down in regards to dealing with the affliction. That, in turn, leads to this one featuring some rather enjoyable elements here within these scenes that feature is attempts at saving them, from the opening in the nightclub surrounded by demons to the failed exorcism attempts at the beginning of their sessions to the rather fun final attempt at the carnival where it all comes together in a fun, exciting manner with all sorts of fun tricks are utilized to offer up the kind of strong finish here with the numerous false finishes leading up to the big fight at the end which has a lot to like. Alongside the film's rather fun and frantic pacing here, this one really manages to get enough to like here to hold this one up over it's few minor flaws. The main issue with this one is the fact that there's just not a whole lot of actual action going on in the film. By taking away the concept of the possession that usually transpires in here, this one gives a series of scenes where all that happens is him going around talking to others in a dream world which constitutes the majority of the actual exorcism scenes here. This doesn't generate any kind of sustained sense of fear throughout here due to the lack of actual threat posed for these moments and it really makes the film feel devoid of any actual supernatural content for a large portion of the time. Likewise, the film also struggles to really get a handle on when the kid is actually possessed, as there's nothing here to readily give away what happened or how it occurred as he simply ends up in the manner after the beginning when he kills the intruder leaving this one with no clue as to how he ended up in that manner. As well as some rather spotty CGI to denote the demons' presence around them, these here are all that really hold this one down.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy."
" A far more intelligent film than it appears to be.
",0.5095,-0.7651,2017-10-16 00:00:00,7,"I'll simply say this about Incarnate, if you're looking for a film that is in the vein of Insidious or some other horror film that relies on the viewer actually paying attention to the story over the typical guts and gore, then you're in luck. However, if you're looking to just kill an hour and a half with something mindless, look elsewhere. This movie, while by no means perfect, is also highly underrated and at least tries to put its' own twist on the whole possession sub-genre. Don't let the negative rating or reviews put you off, this is one film that you'll regret not viewing several years later. In this viewer's opinion, this is a future cult classic."

Also I usually enjoy Aaron Eckhart in his craft. After about two scenes of worthy dialog in I became latched and realized why it had some buzz (script, cast).The story-line has worthy elements, and it competes well with other 'possession' films. I do not scare from horror, but enjoy digesting it for social understanding of what gets beneath the skin of common folk. I really enjoyed The Order and The Rite as well if that helps.The cast was great and I feel they exceeded the quality of its worthy script -- the best part of the final product.This movie will likely not be your favorite movie in any level of context... movies generally, dramatic horrors, films about possession. I still believe it's worth the view for anyone who is into any of those things or any of the primary cast as they all bring the value.My biggest complaint is the director and / or the editor... there were some early shots scenes and music scores that almost convinced me to turn it off and move on. Horror doesn't need help from 'camp'. Because I weathered those I got to bits that mattered and then the meat of the film proved interesting (atheist, raised Catholic, if you feel that detail matters).Special kudos to Eckhart's agent for finding yet another off- the-beaten-path script for him to bring his talent to. He will always be remembered for Harvey Dent of course, but for me films like ""I Frankenstein"", ""Thank You for Smoking"", and this one are roles I will ultimately most cherish him for.Understand this up front, this film is *not* for everyone. My ratings / appreciations are my own and I tried to express my appreciations in such a way that the folks who would appreciate it will know who they are up front."
" Fate worse than death
",-0.7906,0.506,2017-08-28 00:00:00,8,"This production pulls out all the stops by employing top ""B"" lister Aaron Eckhart to play Dr. Ember. Since childhood Ember has had the ability to enter people's minds and ""expel"" the ""demon"" or ""mental parasite"" as he prefers. He chases the demon who caused an auto accident which killed his wife and child (doesn't care so much about the child) and put him in a wheelchair. He works with a team of scientists who perform ""exorcisms."" Meanwhile little Cameron Sparrow (David Mazouz) becomes possessed by touching a homeless woman on his ceiling. (I didn't make this film.) Ember, who is flirting with retirement is coaxed into the job when he believes it is the demon Ash aka Plague, aka I didn't write them all down, that killed his wife. The demon is toying with Ember... ""let the games begin."" This is a slightly different type of exorcism film because it does not use both a young and a washed up priest, although Catholics do find their way into the film. The rest of the formula is the same. Sigh. Now if I was living my dream, and someone told me it was a dream and I had to leap from a high up window to ""escape"" it...I am pretty sure I wouldn't do it. That's just me. I am open for possession.Good ""B"" film acting. Story seems well crafted although it feels like they cut a scene or two...like how did they move and examine the kid without touching him? Guide: No sex, or nudity or even a reference to sex. Even in the bathroom scene a man is washing his face. Early bar scene with pretty women acting sexy. There is one F-word usage claimed by IMDb that I missed."
" OK Possession movie
",0.4466,0.8193,2017-08-09 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this genuinely frightening addition to the demonic possession genre. It has an intriguing take on possession, but these ideas could have been more developed. Still, it's better than its mostly negative reviews would suggest. It plays with the tropes of the genre, trying to give them a quasi-scientific spin. It is more watchable than most movies of the genre, probably because of the cast. The usually handsome, lantern jawed Aaron Eckhart plays against type, uncharacteristically unshaven and disheveled as a broken man with unwanted abilities. The sad faced actor(didn't catch his name) playing the alcoholic father is quite moving as well. There are a few twists, and it gets under the skin quite effectively."

It is a paradigm now for studios to mark certain films as short run releases; assuming they'll do better on VOD than in wide release. While it has greatly increased the quality of VOD films, it has stuck some gems in there that ought to have been seen by more folks in theaters. This is one.(The model has backfired. ""It Follows"" was pre-determined to be a short run dump to VOD when it began doing boffo box office. The studio scrambled to cut a new deal with the VOD company as pulling it from the theaters would have killed the unexpected hit they were having! A deal was struck and the film remained in theaters and earned back much more than it's budget. Talks of a sequel have swarmed ever since - though I hope they don't as you know how sequels tend to go).Kudos to all in the cast. No ball dropping anywhere that I could detect."

" Almost like any other horror film, but enjoyable.

I don't know what's the reason, but surprisingly it was a much better film than I expected. It had a decent cast, particularly for a small budget horror, it was a well made film. Even the screen-writing was good. They should have improved it a bit, but still not a bad film with all the fine performances.This is about a man who can enter the minds of the possessed ones by the evil spirits. Like most of the horror films, the exorcist has a person feud with one particular spirit. So after searching for it many years, he finds that a boy was possessed by the same spirit. Now it's his time to avenge whatever he had suffered from earlier in his life.The horror film fans and film fanatics might think it is an average, but for the common people it will work fine. There are some good moments in the film. Overall, well designed film in those crucial parts. You are going to see totally a different Aaron Eckhart, especially being in the lead. So I feel it is worth a try.6½/10"
" Somehow boring and over the top at the same time
",-0.128,0.9796,2017-05-09 00:00:00,4,"I understand that actors have to work just like the rest of us, but it must be very hard for someone like Aaron Eckhart to go from a large role in one of the greatest and most memorable films of all time 'The Dark Knight' down to a forgettable and pretty terrible little horror film like 'Incarnate'. It's hard to watch as well because Eckhart is a fantastic actor and is worth so much more than a film like this. Needless to say 'Incarnate' is not very good.The main reason for this is that it fails to understand where true horror comes from. True horror is almost exactly the opposite of what this film portrays it as. Real horror is grounded. It's real. It's something that could actually happen to you or your friends or your family. Maybe not entirely realistic in theory, but at least in approach. Mainly that stems from characters. Every character in 'Incarnate' is over the top, and completely unbuyable. There simply are very few people like this in the real world, and sadly the ones that are like this are very hard to care for.Combine over the top characters with a story that is both bland and somehow also over the top at the same time and you have a pretty lousy excuse for a film. There are zero frights, zero tension created and all that leaves you with is a bizarre sci-fi story that neither makes much sense, nor is smart enough to make you care. Basically what I'm say is don't bother watching this film. Easy."

The unique feature of the movie is that the devil enters the subconscious mind by means of creating a fake reality to snare victims; the scientist has found a way to enter into that fake reality in an attempt to combat the forces of darkness. The lead actor,Aaron Eckhart, gives a stunningly realistic portrayal of a totally driven but wretchedly troubled individual. Very impressive production and direction and whilst I felt the climax could and should of been different, I give this picture 7 and a half, rounded down:7/10."
" Incarnate lacks originality, terrible script, and lacks scares.
",-0.6705,-0.9723,2017-04-11 00:00:00,4,"Incarnate is a supernatural horror film that borrows elements from other better films with no originality, boring acting, terrible dialogue, and it lacked scares and thrills. The supernatural horror concept has been seen in many of producer Jason Blums films and others involving an exorcism and possession. Incarnate tries to be different with a spin on the exorcism idea, as Dr. Ember (Aaron Eckhart) enters the mind of the victim that is being possessed to fight against the entity out of the body. Kind of sounds like a horror movie version of Inception. It was a neat idea, but the direction and boring script never really gives the characters the proper treatment it deserves. The performances were dull; Aaron Eckhart is a good actor placed in a not so great movie. Even the supporting actress Carice van Houten gave a tedious performance after seeing her as a strong provocative character in Game of Thrones. Incarnate also lacked scares and thrills. It was difficult to see anything worthy about it. The film tries to build a subplot involving the accident that led to Dr. Ember being crippled to a wheelchair and his motive in these cases of trying to track down an entity. Incarnate was a boring horror film that could have used a neat concept but executed in a terrible script, and dull acting."

The story is yet a bit different than usual so that was a good point. I was just a bit disappointed by the to me stupid ending. That could have been better and maybe I would have scored it a seven instead of a six. The cast isn't bad, I don't get why some reviewers write about bad acting because it wasn't. There is a good amount of horror, not too pronounced but freaky enough to be enjoyable as a horror movie.

" Brad Peyton's supernatural horror thriller is more of a snoozer than a competent scarefest
",-0.25,-0.9747,2017-03-13 00:00:00,3,"With the horror genre running on a low tank of original ideas, this film continues on a string of uninspiring horror flicks with nothing to grant beyond formula and rundown clichés. That is not say to director Brad Peyton could not have made this idea work, even if it involved retreading a few seen-it-before elements. Unfortunately, his execution and the competent performances by the cast including Aaron Eckhart fail to save this movie from falling to a drivel. The only thing keeping this movie from falling into absolute obscurity maybe Peyton's small delivery of thrills that manage to once or twice and the performances the cast manages to dig up. Nonetheless, it is a thoroughly forgettable ride from nearly start to finish. So what is the story here? Aaron Eckhart plays Dr. Seth Ember, a paranormal scientist with the ability to enter inside other people's minds and cast out the demons that plague them. Ember himself suffers from a troubled past with the death of his wife and son in a car accident. When a young boy named Cameron Sparrow (played by David Mazouz) is unexpectedly possessed by a demonic entity, his mother (played by Carice Van Houton) must enlist the help of Ember and his colleagues Camilla (played by Catalina Sandino Moreno) and Oliver (played by Keir O'Donnell) to journey inside Cameron's subconscious mind in order to fight off the demon that possesses him.The movie is not completely devoid of scares, at least after the first third when the plot finally kicks in. Sadly, the scares come very few and far in between to the point where it hammers you with the urge to check your watch multiple times before the end credits appear. The film spends most of its time borrowing elements of films like 'Insidious' which follows a concept nearly identical to this one with a child being possessed and another human forced to enter through their mind to save them. In the process, it wastes its already-short potential on cheap jump scares and creepy imagery that never quite lands. Is the sight of people turning their eyes black and morphing into demons supposed to be scary? Is adding enough blood and gore to push the PG-13 rating to the brink supposed to add a sense of tension? If so, Brad Peyton certainly fails to make both of these work here. The film also has some half-successful attempts at emotional resonance which is greatly incorporated in Dr. Seth Ember's background dealing with the loss of his wife and child in a car wreck, and Ember hoping to gain redemption from performing this experiment on Cameron. In terms of acting, Aaron Eckhart does okay but clearly seems bored in the role. Carice Van Houton does her job in the role of the child' mother as does David Mouzez as the creepily possessed kid. But it is enough to raise spend chills down your spine? Unless you are easily scared back by a child talking in a demonic voice, there is nothing to be truly startled about.Incarnate is a disappointing supernatural horror piece that offers more of a snoozer than a satisfying scarefest. By the end, it is very easy to forget about that. Brad Peyton tries to invent a good horror picture, but his efforts come to frail results."

It's a supernatural horror flick that has nothing much to offer. Without making much difference goes some twist and turns.

" What a waste.
",-0.4215,0.9245,2017-02-26 00:00:00,2,"I was fuming by the time I left the theatre.I cannot begin to tell you how much I absolutely loathe that a premise that has so much potential gets butchered the way this one did.We finally get a main character who could be so unique – not only is he a scientist, which finally takes away the only approach made on these movies which is the religious one – but he can also get in people's minds. And what do we get instead? The epitome of all clichés. And there are so many of them, don't even get me started. There is the scruffy grief-stricken widower with nothing to lose, a religious crisis and a long time vendetta, there are his couple of sidekicks with the fancy aura reading machines (except here they are ion charges or something), and the secretive mentor and the deadly serum that the mc says he is never going to use but you so know he is gonna – and the rest is just filler for something that could be truly creepy.Incarnation grabbed my attention from the get go, particularly with that initial dance club scene, which featured the most perfect song for the moment and gave me an almost Matrix vibe. We quickly know what is going on, what our main guy is capable of doing and how he is doing it – all through the natural sequence of the story, not because the information is dumped on the viewer. And that approach pretty much stops there.From that point on it all went downhill. There are so many plot holes (Why call it Maggie?? Even the demons called it Maggie! It's the name of an innocent woman, for crying out loud. Why does Ember need to almost die if he says he found out about his ability while he was sleeping? Why not just give him a powerful sedative? Why did the entity target Ember so particularly? I mean, if it wanted to keep possessing people it should have left him minding his own business, not helping anyone cause he was just trying to lead a normal life, right? Why was the boy not tied up if it was so dangerous for him to touch anyone? Come to think of it, why did it just stand there? Why did people touch Ember on the street seconds after yelling for people not to touch him? There is so much more but I forgot it in the meantime), the dialogues are cringe-worthy, whatever information needs to be delivered is dumped without much context, the kid's mother has no heart and doesn't really seem concerned for her son's well-being, she is actually doing Ember a favour of allowing him to help the boy and the way things developed is just why I tend to stay away from movie theatres for months in a row. Worst of all, something that could be incredibly original turned out to be a total rip off of a movie I watched many moons ago, right down to the way it ended. Except the other one took place in some woods, I think.*sigh*There were definitely interesting touches here and there like the detail of the watches stopping, the fact that Ember is in a wheelchair provided some exciting scenes, and even the ending, despite being a total rip-off, had a bittersweet tinge to it considering what Felix had told Ember. However, overall I cannot say Incarnate is worth watching."

" Truly terrible, mindless, lazy and dumb
",-0.836,-0.8131,2017-01-26 00:00:00,3,"I watched this because Aaron Eckhart stars and it's hard to believe that he would choose a script that is truly terrible... unless someone either has something embarrassing on the man. And that must be the case. While Eckhart tries his best to be the wheelchair bound man who tries to get into people's minds to ""evict"" demons, this dud cannot be redeemed from its own demons.So what is so terrible about this film? It's as if the writers just came up with a concept and were too lazy to think about whether it made sense. And the director just allows an amorphous concept - something about demons possessing a body by convincing the mind of the victim that it was getting what it desires in a dream state - it is all lightly explained gobbledygook. The awkwardness in the script plays out among the actors and it feels like a poor man's B-movie. As others have said, it's something akin to Constantine meets Inception and the Exorcist, borrowing concepts and not doing a very convincing job of getting the audience to buy into the mumbo jumbo jargon that they hope you won't too think too deeply about. Here's the entire movie in a nutshell, clichés excluded. Man whose family was killed by a person who was possessed by a demon agrees to exorcise a boy who is possessed by a demon that he believes is the same. There are no real twists in this movie and even every semi- twist in the ending can be guessed by the audience by a writer who thought he was really clever. We've seen this all before a million times and much better. Poor Aaron. This one is a real career killer."
" A for effort but weak plot
",-0.5927,0.9719,2017-01-11 00:00:00,5,Too many reviews feel the need to offer a summary but I like to go on the assumption you know that by now. This movie was not as good as I thought it would be to be honest. I was excited by the trailer because it looked like an interesting new take on possession films but it was just not executed that great to me. Normally I see films these days and think it really didn't have to be 2 or 2 and a half hours long but Incarnate is the opposite. This movie craved more time. There's a reason why Constantine was 2 hours. The concept was also similar to The Cell as far as entering the subject's mind which can only have so much science in it as it's impossible. However unlike Constantine there's not enough supernatural background information to support the story. It was basically just I have a gift to go into possessed people's minds. Why can he only enter the minds of possessed? How long has he known he could? Are there others like him? What caused this gift? Inate? Or near death experience? Also this Maggie demon (which isn't typical as all angels including the fallen are historically male though I know why they call the demon this name it just sounds inaccurate) so obsessed with torturing him? No reason mentioned. So its not a bad movie at all but it starts out strong and ends weak like a mixed drink. It needed to be longer. It felt so rushed like it thought it was an episode of X-files and had to be done in 45 min. Pretty sure if it had been an X-files episode it would've been a 2 or 3 parter. Also great cast with the exception of the mother. She almost looked bored the whole movie as if her child wasn't possessed. She really needed to take notes from Ellen Burstyn. To sum up its similar to movies that were executed better. Constantine and The Cell to me. Others say Insidious but since I think those movies were crap I rather prefer Incarnate. Two thumbs up for trying to be different but honestly surprised this wasn't a straight to DVD.

The best things about it was that it had some entertaining dream scenes and the main character was portrayed well. It's mostly just a standard horror movie otherwise.The biggest mystery to me is why it was on the shelf for 3 years? The end credits says this movie is from 2013. I wonder why it took so long for it to come out?"
