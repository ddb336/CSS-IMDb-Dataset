" hot pursuit
",0.0,-0.4285,2021-02-02 00:00:00,4,I honestly had high hopes going into watching this movie bc of both sofia and reese. but the jokes and dialogue were so bad. it was very unfunny movie.
" The laughs keep coming
",0.4939,0.7906,2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"I've watched this film 3 times now; me and my daughter love it. The banter between the 2 leading ladies is hillarious. A great example of the odd couple, for women."

" Divided opinion
",0.0,0.815,2020-10-28 00:00:00,7,"I think this was a good comedy with very good actors. Sofia's character has the best story, no doubt, and it worked wonderfully with the development of the movie. I did find Reese's character somewhat obnoxious, which is upsetting for me because I think she made a good job. This is a pretty good movie to watch and unwind but probably wouldn't watch a second time."
" A truly gruelling endurance test
",0.4404,-0.4926,2020-10-05 00:00:00,1,And I'm only talking about the trailer! I couldn't even finish the trailer. Once sofia started wailing I was out. Looks beyond dreadful.
" Horrible, lazy writing and clichÃ© acting.
",-0.7184,0.3612,2020-07-14 00:00:00,2,"The entire movie is very lazily written, and panders to those who aren't phased by the same movie being released four times a year.Every scene in the movie feels like it's been done a million times before. Every time something happens, you already know what's going to go on for the next ten minutes."
" Sofia Vergara a only thing that worth to see!!!
",0.4168,0.3398,2020-07-02 00:00:00,5,"Who could tell that Reese Witherspoon one day became a simple supporting actress so to speak, she is the producer on this silly and poor comedy, without the personal attributes which Vergara does, as strong sex appeal all things will be collapse, Reese's characters Cooper a policewoman is so dumb than funny, in a sloppy plot which you don't know if laugh or cry, Vergara asserts oneself the unique reason to see it, your sexy body's posture s on those tight clothes stolen the show, well characterized of a fancy Colombian Boss's wife, the unbelievable story is sexy oriented, in this field Reese is easily swallowed by the veteran actress, you want just killing time, please feel free!!!Resume:First watch: 2020 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 5"

",-0.7096,0.0,2020-04-11 00:00:00,2,"Couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of this slop. I can only guess that the ""humour"" in this movie is aimed at a niche that I have never personally encountered. ðŸ™„"
" Funny and enjoyable
",0.7003,0.8398,2020-03-13 00:00:00,8,"I had really fun! Nice movie... great acting for both the actresses... Witherspoon and Vergara. Well done!
I spent an hour and a half watching this movie and I would do that again.
Reading so many bad reviews, I understood that there are many people full of hate and unsatisfied of their lives who try to destroy the others' lives instead of trying to improve their own lives.
To some of those people I would say... try to act in a movie like this and maybe you'll understand how bad you are in comparison of true actors. I forgot... nobody would take you as actors, sorry.
Anyway it's not my business.
If sometimes you would like to have just some fun without asking questions, watch this movie."
" Don't waste your time
",0.3252,-0.7967,2020-02-20 00:00:00,1,The rating should have the ZERO option. Because 1/10 is too much for this garbage. A total waste of time. Not funny at all. Complete stupidity and overacting.
" Pretty funny Hollywood comedy
",0.8225,0.9351,2020-02-08 00:00:00,6,"It's not bad, it's not that good either. Its pretty funny at times. I laughed some times and I don't laugh so often when I see movies. It's an easy to watch, pretty undertaining comedy."
" Bad.

" Utter crap
",-0.3818,0.7203,2019-11-23 00:00:00,1,"Forced and boring plot, simply annoyng characterisation from the 'spoon and the same Latino big tit bimbo that Vergara always plays.Some scenes almost appear unscripted, almost like it was being ad libbed which would have been fine it it wasn't so bloody awful (witness the ""pretend lesbian"" scene.. Cringeworthy)I laughed out loud once when one of the bent cops said ""there's a lining?"" Watch out for it. You can switch off after that."
" So Funny!

" Hot Nothing!!!...
",0.0,-0.09,2019-08-11 00:00:00,3,"The combination of these two commanding actresses on paper. Probably looked promising on the outset. However, when the reality came to light. They both just bombed and fizzled out. The movie is mundane and tedious. You just want to click to the next channel, but your mesmerized by the entire nonsense of what is actually on. Vergara is whiny the whole time, and Witherspoon is completely out of place playing a cop."
" Two unfunny hags
",0.0,0.3818,2019-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Ok Sofia Vergara used to look hot 30 years ago, no more, now she looks like a drag queen. Reese Witherspoon used to be a great actress 30 years ago, now she is terrible."
" so funny ?? !!!
",0.6629,-0.6821,2019-06-28 00:00:00,10,Rated this a ten bc of all the bad ratings. it's probably a 6.8. i'm normally not a fan of sofia vergara she's just kind of loud and obnoxious on modern family. also didn't wanna watch this bc i saw the low score. it's rly well paced and absolutely hilarious. really worth the watch. men just hate women so obviously any time they try to be funny they hate it whether it's funny or not
" Easy Watching.....
",0.4404,0.8357,2019-06-22 00:00:00,8,I really liked this and it was funny and easy to watch.
" Charming enough to be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure, because it's silly and cliche, but Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara are lovely and (just enough) funny to watch it
",0.9337,0.9874,2019-06-16 00:00:00,6,"This is definitely a girl's flick, but some guys who are into the charming humor of Reese Witherspoon or are into the hot looks of Sofia Vergara, could love it as well.Dont expect comedy fireworks though, because Reese Witherspoon is not at her best in this picture. She has starred in much better other pictures. But this movie can still be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure: a comedy which you wont boast about that you have seen it, but which you secretly, (while eating your popcorn or chocolate icecream), still enjoyed enough to pass the time with.The story: Reese Witherspoon plays the role of an insecure cop who has to escort Sofia Vergaras, (a drugcriminalÂ´s wife) to court. Will they get there alive and will their shoes be saved from being stolen?"
" Hot Pursuit Review
",0.0,0.6577,2019-03-23 00:00:00,7,"A strait-laced, accident-prone Texas cop (Reese Witherspoon) who is desperate for respect finds herself on the lam with a reluctant witness against a Latin drug lord (Sofia Vergara).
Reese Witherspoon is cute as a button, va-va-voom SofÃ­a Vergara offensively amusing in a jape about a strait-laced, accident-prone Texas cop desperate for respect and a reluctant witness against a Latin drug lord who are on the lam, cuffed together and bickering, framed for murder and pursued by bent killer cops and cartel goons.
In its dreams it wants to be Midnight Run in stilettos. It's genial, with appealing stars and fair giggles - especially a couple of nice little running gags such as references to Witherspoon's ever-decreasing height and Vergara's ever-increasing age - but in the second half Anne Fletcher's film hits too many obvious beats and labours to find enough funny to fill its modest 87 minutes."
" Cold Torpor!
",0.0,0.9958,2019-03-19 00:00:00,3,"Hot Pursuit doesn't try to hide the fact that it's quite a blatant rip-off of both The Heat and Midnight Run. What it can't hide is that it's just not funny. When a ""comedy's "" out-takes (as seen during the post credits roll) are funnier than the movie's inclusions, you know there's problems and Hot Pursuit is full of them.I actually liked the start where we see in abbreviated scenes Reese Witherspoon's Rose Cooper grow to maturity in the back of her legendary cop father's patrol car. It gives explanation as to why she became a policewoman, but there's never any explanation provided for why she has such an anally-retentive personality. I think director Anne Fletcher was expecting the audience to just find this amusing. However, speaking for myself (and I suspect a great many others), I agree with SofÃ­a Vergara's character of Daniella Riva, who talks about her very early in the movie, as just being incredibly ""annoying"". We know Witherspoon can successfully play comical characters. But to successfully make someone like Rose Cooper, comically attractive, the actor has to be a very good improvisor with great timing. Think Robin Williams or Jim Carrey. Witherspoon doesn't have that particular talent and neither does she have the benefit of a funny, clever script supporting her performance.Speaking of Vergara, the other lead, just makes you automatically think caricatures. Think of a none too bright, entitled, Mexican drug lord's moll/wife and there you have Daniella laid out for you. All bling and exaggerated accents and little substance to her character. Boring! Hot Pursuit is an 87 minute ""comedy"" that feels way longer.The oh-so predictable storyline involving witness protection, dirty cops, cartel hitmen, too many handcuff scenes, multiple chases and a waiting grand jury was done in a fresh, exciting and humorous fashion, 30 odd years ago, with Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in Martin Brest's Midnight Run. After the passing of 3 decades you could be forgiven for thinking the cinema world is just about ready for a female dominant remake. Unfortunately Hot Pursuit is left floundering at the starting gates of any potential match race. It's a complete dud!"
" This movie literally gave me a headache
",0.0,0.7596,2019-03-17 00:00:00,1,"It's amazing how many 1 star reviews a movie can get, and still end up with a 5.1 IMDB rating! I'm further perplexed by the occasional 9/10 or even 10/10 review! Seriously?, this was a near perfect to even perfect movie??This movie was just plain sad, disappointing, and exhausting to sit through because it lacked good acting, comedy, and a good storyline. I watched this movie with my wife and her girlfriends. Her girlfriends left halfway through the movie because they were ""bored"". I wish I could have joined them rather than torment myself with another hour of that crap. Just terrible.It is the current title holder of my ""worst movie ever made"" category"
" Not bad for what it is
",0.431,0.9852,2019-02-05 00:00:00,4,"This movie wasn't so bad as far as American ""comedies"" go. You know it was only made as a Vergara vehicle and it works for what it was intended. But is it good?It's a rather cutesy, by-the-numbers affair. Nothing special.What sets it apart is that this is an American comedy with a lead character who actually enjoys being a woman and is sexy in a distinctly un-American way. She is not foul-mouthed, nasty, isn't shown smoking, drinking, or doing drugs, and there is no reveling in how disgustingly promiscuous she is. The movie is devoid of all the gutter humor the dual citizens of Hollyweird promote. No indirect preaching on ""racism,"" no casual depictions of homosexuality as some kind of noble pusuit -- no filth whatsoever.As a cultural artifact, it deserves a watch for that alone.The story is not bad, it doesn't bore or stall. It just does its job. I'm surprised so many people disliked it. I guess if Vergara's script included pithy comments about the power of her vagina, the American audience may have liked it better."
" Very Good!
",0.54,0.7777,2019-01-31 00:00:00,9,"Nice comedy movie! But, it could have been better."
" Mix-N-Match of Leading Women, Flawed
",0.0,-0.2866,2019-01-27 00:00:00,4,"When you put together a down home woman like Reese Witherspoon with a vivacious and supple woman as Sophia Vergara, one would expect fire. WRONG! The pairing of these two appears so off from the start that is flows horribly through the film.
A young police officer(Witherspoon) with a track record of by the book and clumsiness gets a shot a redemption while trying to help bring in a protected witness(Vergara). There is a complimentary amount of slap stick comedy, but the overlay of the story is dreadful. I went into the film expecting maybe a comedic pairing of (Farley/Spade) instead we get Oil/Water. It is a simple film, as in down sized screenplay, character and plot flaws and ill timed theatrics."
" An Edgier but Light Black Comedy Thriller
",0.5927,0.9752,2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,"10 May 2015. Hot Pursuit is problematic in its delicate balance as a dark comedy but much lighter than the norm, but more edgy than the typical criminal comedy thriller. So what one ends up with a is rather unbalanced but quite satisfying funny movie with a black undertone in places. Reese Witherspoon does a very commendable job in a rather more witty, mental whimsical way. It is Sofia Vergara's performance that pulls the movie down, but because she does a bad job, but her on-screen persona is so one-sided for most of the movie. There are hopeful scenes though in which the audience gets to see Sofia with a more serious presentation that offers up a more fully range of this delightful character. The twists are predictable, yet the subplots seem to hold together quite well and are never atrociously over the top. This is an above average, entertaining criminal comedy thriller worth experiencing. In the same league as Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy's The Heat (2013). What must be careful considered is how this movie has been received as one of the most gender biased rated movies with females loving and males hating this movie. With a box office opening of $13.3 million considered a weak opening while the sci fi thriller Ex Machina (2013) that has accumulated $15.7 million in its second week is considered doing very well, there is something to wonder about how this movie is being rated."
" I didn't walk out of Holmes &Watson, but I walked out of this!
",0.0,-0.9077,2018-12-30 00:00:00,1,"It's really that bad.
Reese Witherspoon was wasted and awful.
SofÃ­a Vergara was doing some weird Lucille Ball impression and constantly screaming all the time.
I just couldn't take it."
" It's not much of a comedy
",-0.2755,0.9924,2018-08-10 00:00:00,5,"It's somewhat fun and interesting and we have a ""dressed to kill"" Sofia Vergara throughout the whole movie, but, that's about it as good points go for this movie. Well, unless you count the fact that it doesn't have much misandry as a good thing, which you kind of do, seeing how many of modern female-lead movies dwell in misandry.It's not very funny, and the best joke, Vergara shooting obscenities in Spanish to the TV whenever it reports that she is 40+ years old, gets old by the third time it is played out.Also, Vergara is best served in small doses. As a protagonist of a whole move, she also gets old (pun intended).The story doesn't make much sense, which is kind of OK for a comedy, but, this one is too unfunny to let the nonsense ""pass"".Reese Whiterspoon tries, but, doesn't get into the part very well. Her accent is fine, but she's not in sync with her role of a tomboy, which is kind of odd, she should be good for this and it's a wonder she hasn't played the part more often. Actually, that might be the problem, she didn't practice it enough, so, now she doesn't do it very well.So, it's not something to avoid at all costs, but, there are many much better comedies."
" I GOT SHOTGUN
",0.0,0.9062,2018-07-15 00:00:00,6,"Cooper (Reese Witherspoon) is a ""hyper-focus"" policewoman. She is allowed to leave the evidence locker to escort a reluctant high value witness (SofÃ­a Vergara) to Dallas. Circumstances causes their plans to go awry and they become on the run, trying to avoid both criminals and cops who want them dead.The movie is cute, but not an over powering comedy. The jokes get old fast such as Sofia's age and Witherspoon's height. Sofia wear a shirt which says ""Butter my Biscuits"" for much of the film while Reese boasts a red dress. They shared a kissing scene and a cat fight because that is what the writers had to stoop to to get laughs. The film had potential as Reese got to use a full southern accent, but the script flopped.Guide: F-bomb in soundtrack. No sex or nudity."
" Omg
",0.0,-0.7717,2018-05-27 00:00:00,1,Worst writing and direction this side of Battlefield Earth.

",0.7089,-0.6739,2018-05-23 00:00:00,2,"This was just horrible. I didn't find it funny at all. And I LOVE both these actresses. Both were very annoying. And Reese's accent was awful. I don't know, I only have a few movies that I can say are the worst I have ever seen, but this is one of them."
" It was ok
",0.296,-0.5416,2018-05-22 00:00:00,5,"The movie wasn't good. It had a few laughs, but the action scenes and laughs weren't timed well and it had too many bad guys and excuses for random action. It didn't seemed well written or choreographed."
" Quite Entertaining
",0.4927,0.9961,2018-04-29 00:00:00,7,"This film actually turned out to be much better, and somewhat funnier, than I expected. Well, not quite because a lot of these films have a few really cool jokes right at the beginning, and then just devolve into a bout of silliness. However, the premise is still pretty good, and I was kept entertained right through to the end, even though it was pretty cliched in many ways, and the ending was pretty much what you expected the ending to be.
 So, we have this woman, whose Dad's a cop and she has been riding in the back of the car with him since she was a little girl. Obviously she grows up to become a cop, even though her Dad is probably famous for being the cop that had his daughter ride in the car with him (and there are a couple of pretty cool scenes in that opening part as well). Unfortunately, she is also one of those really innocent people that doesn't understand a lot of slang, so eventually gets herself in trouble and lands up in the evidence room.
 Well, the movie starts with this drug lord's accountant wanting to testify and they have to get him to Dallas to appear in court. Well, since his wife is going to be with him, they need a female escort as well, and she ends up being the one picked. The problem is that everything turns sour when a couple of assassins shoot the dealer, and the Federal Marshall, and our friend finds herself having to transport the drug dealer's wife across the state of Texas. To say that she happens to be a handful is a huge understatement.
 What we have here is your typical odd couple road movie, which when done well can be a lot of fun. In fact I don't mind the occasional road movie, particularly when it is done well. Okay, there seems to have been quite a few of them being churned out over the years, but that is probably because they work, and work well. Of course they have to be done well for them to work, and while I'd hardly put this film up there with some of the greats, it still has a lot of charm.
 Funny, well, I'm not entirely sure about that. As I mentioned, a lot of these films are light hearted and fun, but they generally have the really good jokes at the beginning, and then just settle down into a nice adventure through to the end. In a way it is very rare to actually find a comedy that has you laughing right through, though unfortunately many of these movies don't have a great rewatch value.
 In another way, it is sort of one of those coming out films, as they all tend to deal with an adventure that really changes a character. At the start she is very awkward, innocent, and really doesn't understand the way things work, but by the end, after being forced to spend a great deal of time with somebody who is her polar opposite, she begins to learn to relax, and to just go with the flow. Sure, she still has that perky innocence about her at the end, but in a way she has come out of her shell, and understands the world much better."

" Not Bad But The Writing And Direction Could Have Been Sharper.
",0.2323,0.9967,2018-01-11 00:00:00,6,"Being a fan of Reese Witherspoon and enjoying Sofia Vergara in Modern Family I had to check out this film. It's a shame that the writers and director decided to take it in the direction they did. Witherspoon does a brilliant job of the OCD Cop Cooper, the scene with the ""Baking Powder"" is one of the best as she gets all hyper as does her speech, and Witherspoon stays in character and accent very well. However, it's Vergara that I feel sorry for as I've seen her in a couple of different roles and she is a good actress. But for the role of Daniella Riva, she's pretty much Gloria.As for the writing, well Feeney and Quaintance are not the best comedic writers I've seen; and along with the director's Anne Fletcher approach, the comedy is as subtle as a brick. For most of the time, the scenes are overcooked. For example, the escape through the men's toilet window. It's been done before, and better, though for me some of the dialogue could have been sharper and wittier. There's also great opportunity to have a little slapstick and sight gags, but this falls flat and the entire scene is too long. I think this would have been a much better film and the story had more seasoned writers and directors produced this movie. That said, it's not too bad a film and everybody needs to hone their skills; it's at least worth one watch to pass some time.The best scene in the movie is the one where Cooper and Daniella are handcuffed and need to drive a bus to escape the bad guys while trying to shoot them. This is a well thought out scene and actually did make me laugh, whereas, the rest of the film only raised a smile.The worst scene is the lesbian group. There are times when it's evident that men wrote this story and this is one of the points in case. Though, the entire scene and set-up feels strained and unloved. It's as though this was thrown into the film, and the director begrudgingly filmed it. Even Witherspoon and Vergara look and feel uncomfortable. It just doesn't work and should have ended up on the cutting room floor.All in all, this isn't the best comedic film I've watched, though it is better than a lot out there at the moment. As I said before it raised a few smiles and raised my mood, which is a good thing, so I would recommend at least one viewing - as long as there's nothing else you'd rather watch."
" Bad movie...
",-0.5423,-0.384,2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"The press essentially acted like this was the first film to have female leads in the history of cinema and insinuated that if you didn't see it, you were a bunch of sexist pigs. Sorry, trendy, PC critics, it's a lousy movie. Bad script, bad direction, and just a whole lot of obnoxiousness. There are other films out there with women in them (despite what the MSM tells you), so seek them out and don't watch a film that uses political correctness to guilt you into seeing it. If critics want to be masochists by making themselves like mediocre movies for political purposes, go ahead. But they can't force the public to follow their lead, proving, yet again, the public is much more intelligent than the critics give them credit for."
" Even Reese Witherspoon can't save this poor movie
",-0.7394,0.8294,2017-03-16 00:00:00,3,"I like Reese Witherspoon very much and I think she is very talented actress. So I'm trying to watch every movie she is in. And also I am a fan of comedies and chick flicks, so why not try this one too. Hot Pursuit's plot did seem okay, when I read the short summary, but after 15 minutes I realized that this movie is going to be boring and predictable. The characters were so annoying, and in the wrong way. There was nothing we haven't seen before.I wonder why Witherspoon agreed to do this movie, because this was terrible. No entertainment value what so ever and no funny jokes. And Vegara was just plain awful, no talent in acting. Or at least not in this movie. This is not the worst movie I've seen, but definitely Witherspoon's worst movie."
" This movie is actually quite funny!
",0.54,0.9747,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I watched it last night and wasn't expecting much (because of all the negative reviews), however, I was pleasantly surprised. It actually has some very funny moments and the two leading ladies have a good on-screen chemistry. I really don't understand why people are coming out in droves to trash this film.... Reese and Sofia are both great and have solid acting chops.There are a few predictable moments and it does start a little slow, but once it gets rolling it is overall pretty funny.If you like comedies, and movies that aren't supposed to be taken seriously, then you won't be disappointed by Hot Pursuit. I enjoyed it so much that I plan on watching it again."
