The last 10 minutes of this movie ruined the entire thing. It was very confusing, absurd and a copout ending like LOST. I still dont understand it and they didnt show the evil presence. Not bad except the unacceptable ending."
" A total rip-off of the 1990 film named ""Jacob's Ladder""

" A fright free exercise in annoyance by people who should know better.
",0.3182,-0.9563,2020-09-16 00:00:00,3,"Directed by Takashi Shimizu, better known for his J-horror Ju-On films as well as the American remake he directed(The Grudge), the movie follows a group of crew and passengers on board the titular Flight 7500 who have to deal not only with their own personal baggage(no pun intended) but also strange supernatural happenings that befall their flight with deadly results.Originally intended to be a late August release for the no longer theatrically active CBS Films back in 2012, the movie was delayed and bounced around the schedule multiple times in the United States before being unceremoniously dumped on Video-on-Demand four years after it was completed. It's clear CBS thought they had a dud on their hands and they were right to think that because this is an absolute dog of a movie.The movie is basically a 1970s Airport movie crossed with the familiar bag of tricks from Takashi Shimizu's Grudge movies...or so you would think. The movie in actuality has very little in terms of supernatural horror going on for the first half of the movie as we instead establish the unlikable/bland 1 dimensional cannon fodder that will serve as our characters for the movie speaking cringe inducing dialogue and making you feel like you're sitting in the worst possible seat on the worst possible airline. There's nothing inherently wrong with wanting to focus on character building and putting horror elements on the back burner, but the characters are so lacking in depth that it feels like the movie's dragging its heels before it gets somewhere interesting(spoiler: it doesn't).Even on a technical level this movie is simply a mess. For at least three quarters of this movie there's virtually no lighting in scenes so it's nigh impossible to see who's doing what because you can only make out dark shapes on slightly less dark backgrounds. Takashi Shimizu's films have used darkness effectively before and the fact he made a movie look this amateurish is simply inexcusable. The acting is fine for the most part, but there's not much material to the characters so they're only called to play one maybe two notes throughout the movie.Flight 7500 wastes an intriguing high concept premise on a shoddy screenplay and inept direction and is a waste of time for all involved."

",-0.623,-0.9112,2020-09-13 00:00:00,1,"This is an example of why so many ""modern"" horror movies are terrible. The opening minute of this movie, with its ridiculous jump cuts to black, actually caused my home cinema system to shut down. I can only assume it was confused as to why the movie was constantly cutting to black and the audio was constantly cutting out.
Directors like this should never work again."
" This was a movie that made me pass out
",0.0,0.8125,2020-09-11 00:00:00,5,"Well the movie had a plot & a real reason, but the movie was an easy ""what is going to have next'"" type of film. Don't waste your money for your DVD/Blu-Ray."
" Unlikable characters, no real scares and a boring, cliched script lead to an uninteresting time
",-0.7096,-0.6688,2020-09-07 00:00:00,2,"There is only one death that isn't off screen. That death is the first one and wasn't even interesting; it just looked like he had a couple seizures and bit his tongue. It was also a bold idea to make almost every character completely unlikable. A good comeuppance death in a horror movie can be fun, but all the characters here are weak, bland versions of stereotypes, so not even their deaths spark any satisfaction. An airplane pilot who is sleeping with a stewardess? How titillating! A hot goth girl who is into death AND she's sitting next to a rude, self absorbed ""karen"" whose husband seems interested in her? How novel! To be honest there wasn't a single scene where I felt tension or anything that made me jump. The ending is stupid and parts of it don't make sense. Two stars because some of the actors really try and the special effects/sets are pretty decent.
TLDR: This movie sucks"

With this one it seems as if you're watching a dream/nightmare, you know ""what could go wrong."" When you are bored and stuck in a house (Coronavirus) this movie is perfect. It's not a over the top movie nor is it a state of the art movie but a low budget movie that somehow delivers the goods.
I won't add spoilers to spoil the movie but will say that if you're expecting a big budget with no huge star name in it well you will be disappointed. A low budget with a decent cast the has little chemistry between them is what you get. In all the movie plays like a nightmare and does it's job in entertaining. Only thing I will say is there is no real explanation as to why things are happening and that is really it's biggest flaw."

At least use it well and leave clues or play with it so at least the viewer has something to think about. Learn from The Sixth Sense, The Others,...But instead we're left with random scares that have no meaning, are random and make it seem like there's something to it when in reality there's nothing.

Ryan Kwanten and Amy Smart, two actors better known for more popular fare, star. As with many such B-movies, the real problem with this is the writing, which is predictable and cliched throughout, a weak retread of tropes previously well established. little enhanced by unlikeable, cookie cutter characters going through the expected motions.

" Crazy Ending Twist
",-0.34,0.4374,2019-05-18 00:00:00,5,You have to get to the last 10mins for the twist...it's a shocker! It's what made the movie fairly good!
" Maybe I missed the point and need to watch again. Or it was rubbish. Still not sure.
",-0.4874,0.9913,2019-05-15 00:00:00,5,"The film is full of non explained events. When I watched The Sixth Sense it became obvious to me what was happening. It then bored the hell out of me. I can see why people didn't get IT and then were stunned. And enjoyed second viewings to see what they missed and really enjoyed again. I sat in the cinema bored bonkers but my wife loved it. Doesn't make me a genius. I just got it instantly.
This movie?? I watched it. I can't give spoilers but can say I enjoyed it. Part because I actually wanted to understand what was happening and more importantly what was intended in the script. Some movies leave them open to your take on it. Or just leave an obvious think back to what the conclusion was to put it together in your own imagination. If either is done properly it can make for a great experience. If not???? Sometimes film just have a rubbish script in your opinion. Then others find it very clever.My opinion on this? I am really not sure. Things in the ending don't seem to make sense thinking backwards. But it has a certain mystery to it which, again, if done well go better unexplained. And maybe some parts I didn't concentrate enough?
Some event are just plainly done very badly to the extent of being amateurish. But if you are trying to fit in a lot of plot events can be acceptable.In conclusion did I enjoy it? Well yes I did. Would I recommend people to see it? Yes. It is not a blockbuster movie, and let's face it a big proportion of them are garbage, but I enjoyed it and I am considering watching it again. Unlike for again for example, again The Sixth Sense in which everything ties in at end and a second watch can be enjoyable. Though not for me as it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I know I am in a minority there. But watching it again may be interesting especially as I know somethings will not be explained because the plot device would not work otherwise. The mystery of it causes the events of the movie. The mystery of it will remain unexplained. What happens around it is what you need to consider.I have given this movie 5/10. On a second watching it may increase as high as 7/10!
Or maybe reduced to 0/10 If I could here.My point is it made me think about it. It actually chilled me at times and I did enjoy it. Bottom line is if I ever board a plane and see a man acting weirdly with a
creepingly odd package he does not want to let go of I would demand to be let of the plane immediately. Also if there was a fat guy stuffing himself with food. He is not an important part of the plot. But he was gross.You may enjoy. You may hate. You may be confused. I was all three. I don't regret watching it. If only someone could explain to me completely what happened......"

",0.2732,0.8879,2019-04-15 00:00:00,4,"Supernatural horror movie set entirely on a flight from the USA to Japan. That in itself does present a potential problem in that the entire running time is pretty much set in a single location, and for me that can become somewhat claustrophobic, as it did here. It takes a while to get going and once it does it is pretty tame, though there are a few creepy moments. Acting is good enough, Nicky Whelan in particular did a great job playing a stuck up, bitchy newly wed. And the reveal at the end, pretty original. Certainly not a bad movie, but neither is it a good one. Instantly forgettable."

On my streaming service it was 78 minutes long, but now I see some web pages saying it is 97 minutes long... Anyway... The whole thing definitely had potential, the real problem was the lazy writing (or maybe the 19 minutes I never got to see). The acting is not bad, you can see the actors did the best they could with what they had. The ending, even with its complete unoriginality, is not that bad either. The only problem is the way they deliver such ending. It just... Happens. The supposed ""ok, this is the truth, brace yourself"" moment just lacks some good writing. Again, it's not the worst movie in the world. You won't feel like a new human being after watching it. You probably won't even get scared (really, it is not scary at all).

" Solid if flawed supernatural effort
",0.1531,-0.9821,2018-04-06 00:00:00,6,"Taking off on a regular flight, a commercial plane heading for Japan suddenly encounters a series of strange events through their flight that signals something might be onboard with them killing off the passengers and flight crew forcing those left behind to battle the strange nemesis.This here was a decent if slightly flawed effort. Among the more enjoyable aspects of this one is the fact that this one really plays with the concept of the fear of flying incredibly well. This one really generates a lot of potentially intriguing scenarios that generate some healthy suspense tactics throughout here, from the early freakout with the deceased passenger in front of the others or the continuing notion of the plane dropping cabin pressure due to excessive turbulence that rocks the plane. The second such sequence, where it goes into the prolonged shaking that generates the plenty of genuine suspense with the extreme behaviors usually associated with airplane travel and in the process of going through these different scenes and setups the film builds a rather nice and frightening fear of flying. As this builds into the later supernatural scenes that tack onto the fear of flying as well as being rather freaky on their own, from the scenes of the fog appearing in the plane to seeing objects move about behind them and all of the occurrences of the figures seen coming out of the darkness to attack the others which is quite an impressive and really generates some strong moments here in the second half as these scenes are far more frequent in both quantity and intensity. Since these start bumping off the passengers far more frequently, the supernatural tendencies give way to a rather fine twist in the later half where it really has some fun going along with the fun it generates through this setup. These here manage to hold this one up over the few minor flaws. The main issue holding this one down is the fact that there's just no real point to the inclusion of the twist at all. This one doesn't really have any kind of setup or early hints at all throughout here, simply just appearing out of nowhere and coming out of nowhere simply for the sake of having a terrifying final half that doesn't really offer any kind of emotional payoff anyway. There really isn't any way this one offers a kind of early warning about the situation which simply makes the whole thing even more ludicrous than it already is. Likewise, the film also struggles to get going in the early half where nothing much really happens for long stretches of time which makes this a tough one to get going on. The lack of real supernatural action here does manage to make this even tougher to get into with the lack of action to drag out this section of the film. Otherwise, there's not much else in terms of gore or kills to really hold this one back.Rated Unrated/PG-13: Language and Violence."
" A lot of potential - but missed opportunity
",0.2263,0.7135,2018-03-23 00:00:00,5,"I will start by echoing many others who say the concept is interesting. And after reading about Helios Airway flight 522 (which was mentioned in another review) I think it's all the more intriguing. But the thing is, this movie did so little with the concept, character development, etc. that it just isn't good. I guessed the ending as soon as people started disappearing. It's super predictable. Not a big deal - it's hard to provide a real ""twist"" these days. But there could have been a lot more plot development to get the viewer to the twist. Instead of people disappearing for no apparent reason, how about giving clues. So spirits hang around because they have something they can't let go of? How about showing them letting go in a really subtle way that gives you a little clue but doesn't give away the whole plot? Like honestly, the one flight attendant should have disappeared right after she acknowledged that her boyfriend wasn't going to leave his wife. She could have gone into the cargo hold and never come back. Or why did that character hang around for the rest of the movie after she had this life altering realization? Why did the youtube guy disappear at all? It's not like they showed any unfinished business for him to wrap up before disappearing. Better attention to detail like that would have given the viewer clues as to what was happening and give us an ending that makes sense. Instead we are left with a pale hand and some smoke making people disappear for no good reason. The whole plot is totally disjointed making the thrills and the mystery just eh."

Original post: My biggest problem is after two incidents of severe turbulence, a passengers death, the near death of more due to loss of cabin pressure...and the pilots just continue to their long term destination in Tokyo instead of detouring to the nearest airport. I know it is a movie but you got to have a sense of realism.

" What really happened to Flight 7500?...
",0.0,0.9989,2017-07-13 00:00:00,6,"As a horror fan, I did of course take the chance to sit down and watch ""Flight 7500"" when I was given the chance. However, I had no prior knowledge of the movie, it's storyline and synopsis, and didn't know who starred in the movie. But that hardly mattered, because it was my interest in the horror genre that spurred my interest to give the movie a chance without any prior knowledge.""Flight 7500"" started out quite nicely and quickly picked up a good pace, which set the atmosphere and the mood quite nicely, and it also set the bar of expectations fairly high for me. And luckily then the movie maintained that level of pace, thrill and mystery all the way to the very end.The character gallery in the movie was actually quite good, there was a wide array of different types of characters; some you connect with, some you instantly take a liking to, some you just dislike right away, and so forth. So writer Craig Rosenberg had managed to do a good job with the characters in the story.To bring the characters to life on the screen they had assembled a fairly good ensemble of acting talents. For me, there were only a couple of familiar faces on the cast list, that being Leslie Bibb and Jamie Chung. And I do enjoy watching new faces in a movie, because then I don't have any subconscious associations to other characters portrayed by the performers. And I will say that the cast ensemble here really performed quite well and were great at bringing their individual characters to life on the screen.Writer Craig Rosenberg and director Takashi Shimizu were actually very successful in their endeavor of making a movie that keeps the audience in the dark and keeps the plot and storyline as a mystery. I enjoyed how you were kept in the dark and really didn't know what was going on, so you were every bit as on edge and terrified as the characters in the movie were. And that really worked out so very well in favor of the movie and it set a fabulous atmosphere.Actually I will say that ""Flight 7500"" sort of feels like it could be a part of the ""Twilight Zone"" universe, because it definitely has that vibe and atmosphere going on. So if you enjoyed ""Twilight Zone"" then you will most definitely also find enjoyment in ""Flight 7500"".It was nice how the audience was kept in the dark and having to guess and speculate about what was happening about the flight, and I found the reveal of the actual events to actually be rather interesting. I hadn't foreseen that turn of events, so it was a nice surprise for me.The ending of the movie, meh... It was just a bit too generic and really didn't bring any closure to the entire movie. But all in all, a very entertaining horror mystery, and I can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch ""Flight 7500"" if you haven't already seen it."

",-0.5448,0.4907,2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,The movie is about a bunch of random people experiencing supernatural terror aboard a flight headed to Tokyo .Of course the movie had some cliché jump scares some surprisingly that scared me a bit .This movie also had a few unlike able characters as is normal for most horror films .The special effects were so so at best and could have been done a lot better .The scares are similar to The Grudge and there is only one instance of somewhat graphic violence but nothing extreme .The acting was fine for what it was and they all did their best with the material they were given.The twist at the end I have seen more then once in other movies but it was still sad and surprising because I didn't see it coming .SPOILER AHEAD TURN BACK NOW IF YOU Don't WANT TO KNOW OR HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER!!!!! The twist at the end of course is that they were all dead due to a leak in the oxygen masks which did not protect them from the gas floating around inside of the plane SPOILER!!!!!! There was also another twist that made no sense and was merely set up to give the audience one final jump scare.I'd never buy this movie and I'm glad I never saw this in theaters either but for what it was it wasn't bad and I surprisingly liked it a little bit .As my summary states this film was not bad but it wasn't great either by any means .One of the actresses also Scout Taylor Compton was virtually unrecognizable in this film .
" I'd Initially Downloaded This Movie Because...?
",0.0,-0.9089,2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"You know, after viewing this film in its entirety last night, I couldn't help but wonder why I'd acquired it in the first place. Firstly, it's rated PG-13. Because I tend to go for the more over-the-top, horrific kinds of flicks like ""A Serbian Film"", ""Slaughtered Vomit Dolls"" and ""Melanchole der Engel"", I'm flabbergasted about why I got this one. It had been sitting, unwatched, in my collection for months. I'm guessing that I downloaded it by accident in my quest for something entirely different. Its acquisition, then, was a mistake.The movie had a few good bits; I won't lie. The good bits? The cast were easy on the eyes, that's for sure. Their acting skills? Meh. It is what it is - a horror film. Nothing Oscar-worthy here. Had this film been released ""Sixth Sense"" it would've been seen as a masterpiece despite its flaws. Consequently, this turns out to be just another ""you're a ghost, so die already"" movie. (That's the major spoiler, but I did check the spoiler box above). You know, any film that references William Shatner's ""Twilight Zone"" episode can't be all that bad. The film makers get two points for that."
