" THE NEXT PULP FICTION
",0.0,0.8818,2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"Wow, incredible, innovative, genius and not cliche and repetitive raunchy gag jokes over, and over, and over again. A timeless classic that truly challenges the mind."
" Better than expected!
",0.4926,0.8225,2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,As corny and silly as the 80s Vacation movies were in the best ways possible. I was expecting another lame attempt at rebooting a franchise. Worth the watch. Solid laugh out loud moments.
" Good
",0.4404,0.8555,2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,This movie is one of the funniest movies in 2015 .It's funny and enjoyable.
" Thoroughly watchable
",0.0,0.8047,2021-02-28 00:00:00,7,"OK, it's totally inferior to the original but at least it's a sequel rather than a remake. Cameos from Chevy Chase and Beverly DAngelo make it totally worthwhile for me. There are plenty of nods to the original trip and whilst the quality and class of comedy (and actors) doesn't match up to the early 80s origins, it's more amusing than you'd expect. Shame there's no Uncle Eddie in it."
" I laughed pretty hard! The original was an R-rated film as well people!
",0.8684,-0.9843,2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,"I never really cared to watch this back in 2015 when it came out but just caught it on IFC and it was hilarious! I keep reading reviews of people upset it's crude but for some reason aren't remembering the original was too! They were National Lampoons movies and the first two (the original AND European) were also R-rated movies. They were as crude as crude could be in the early 80's and now this one is as crude as crude could be in 2015. You'd think for such big fans of the originals, people would actually have remembered them. Regardless, great stupid comedy!!!"
" When you have a big budget but dont have a script
",0.0,-0.6814,2021-02-16 00:00:00,1,"Idk how this movie finds poop and nudity funny at all,
Maybe this the worse movie I've watched since get him to the greek.
I dont usually hate comedy movies but this is just bad in every way"
" Seriously overrated! Applegate salvaged this piece of crap
",-0.5562,0.5696,2021-02-16 00:00:00,3,This movie doesn't even deserve 4 stars. Typical current comedy with desensitizing stupid scenes like the car crash etc..... garbage flick that had way more potential. Christine Applegate did the best job though! She's the only reason I gave this 3 stars!
" Awkward & Awful. Ed Helms Worst Moment.
",-0.8271,0.9926,2021-02-14 00:00:00,3,"Just not good. They tried so hard to make this movie awkward in a funny way. This movie was just plan awkward. Ed Helms character, Rusty Griswold, doesn't represent the Rusty Griswold from the original National Lampoon Vacation movies what so ever. Makes no sense.I really wanted to like this movie because I loved the originals. I was able to suffer through it but it wasn't easy. The funniest part of the movie was the various vacation photos of real families that they showed in the opening sequence. Straight dumpster fire from there.This movie is a comedy about a family that goes on a cross county road trip from Chicago to Los Angles to visit the infamous "" WallyWorld Amusement Park"". The movie is a remake of the hit 1983 classic, National Lampoon's Vacation with Chevy Chase. In the original movie, Chevy Chase's character Clark Griswold, takes his family on the same vacation that his son, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) is now trying to recreate decades later with his own family.Comedy remakes rarely work. This one certainly falls in that category. One of the things I hated most about the movie was the dynamic between Rusty's older son and his younger son. In the movie, the younger brother bullies the older one. It just doesn't work. The younger brother is like 8 and consistently makes fun of his older, bigger, teenage aged brother for being soft. I kept waiting for the older brother to kick his ass. Never really happened. Snot nosed brat deserved a spanking. Like the time Michael Scott spanked his adult cousin. That would have made this movie funnier.In all honesty I did enjoy Rusty's brother in law, played by Chris Hemsworth. Dude is great. And the Korean GPS was pretty good. Liked the 4 corner scene between the 4 cops. In fact, every cameo appearance was way better then watching the main characters. Charlie Day playing a whitewater rafting guide trying to commit suicide is funny.All in all I just think that Ed Helms was never going to be able to make this script work. He's a goofy guy that is great in other comedy's but unfortunately he's not Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold. It's not his fault but when push comes to shove, that is what everyone wanted when watching this movie.If you're a fan of the original Vacation movies I can safely say that you can skip this one and watch reruns of the originals. Just YouTube the 2 minute Charlie Day scene and call it good."
" Way too under rated
",0.0,0.9795,2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"It feels like people focus so much on comparing it to the originals. I love the originals and grew up watching those films and it's still a tradition to watch Christmas vacation every year on Christmas Day with my family, but this film was hilarious and captures that same type of whacky and crude humor the originals had. Not saying it's the best of the national lampoons vacation films but it's definitely a good and fun film to watch. Highly recommend it."
" Super funny light movie
",0.7783,0.8067,2021-02-13 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie. It's just funny. That's all! I don't even like the first vacation movie but if you do don't compare it, don't take it to be something it isn't. It's just a really funny, light movie that makes me laugh my ass off every 10 min"
" Embarrassing
",-0.3818,-0.7942,2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,"The worst comedy I've ever seen.
1 in 10 jokes are good.
The quarrels between the brothers are terrible!
The little brother is not funny, he is more of an idiot.
...it was as if it was written by a preschooler...This movie features Chris Hemsworth, Michael Pe√±a, etc... Why?"
" Good fun
",0.7351,0.8913,2021-01-23 00:00:00,6,"Yea, it's funny, mostly in a cringe kind of way. Don't miss the titles at the beginning, no offence intended, but they were the best bit in my opinion. Hilarious, watch closely!"
" 6.1 RATING IS WAY TOO HIGH
",0.0,-0.2755,2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,THIS MOVIE PROVES YOU JUST CAN'T REMAKE A COMEDY CLASSIC
" Evidence that the wrong people travel.
",-0.4767,0.9947,2020-12-31 00:00:00,7,"Rusty certainly is Clark's son, going from Anthony Michael Hall in the first film to Ed Helms here, a pilot for a third rate airline, now married to the outwardly motherly Christina Applegate whose secretly still a party girl inside. They have two sons ( Skyler Gisondo, Steele Stebbins) who obviously despise each other (the YOUNGER brother is the bully in the most hysterically funny offensive way), and it's not just Helm who embarrasses the kids, Applegate does too. This is especially obvious when they stop by her alma mater where she tries to prove she's one of the cool kids after she learns that her reputation had lived on.Helm decides to liven things up by repeating his childhood vacation to none other than Wally World and there are several repeat situations done with a more modern perspective. One thing where it is certainly not modern is in its comic style which is closer to ""Family Guy"" with its no stone unturned in delicious gross out gags that had me yowling in delight and going ""eew!"" over and over as I howled.
This is one of those comedies where the gags need to be discovered fresh with no spoilers as they are beyond description.Rusty's sister Audrey (played by Leslie Mann) also appears, brought up obviously liberal but married to the very Republican Chris Hemsworth, a good ole' boy who finds pleasure by feeding his prize steer beef ribs. Hemsworth leaves nothing to the imagination, proving that lots of things in Texas are big...well maybe not some brains. Older brother Gisindo keeps on encountering a nice girl also traveling that younger brother Stebbins keeps harassing every chance he gets.This was a perfect way to end 2020, so hysterically funny that I couldn't even pick out one scene as my favorite. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appear in cameos as their characters from the four other movies, and it reminded me of how much I've missed the still sultry D'Angelo. If you ever need a break from the real world or the opportunity to laugh at it all in good fun, then take a trip to the updated version of the next Griswold generation. It's a trip that goes in the hall of shame along with those delicious photos in the opening with that terrifically now nostalgic vacation theme song."
" It's rude, crude, and......
",-0.7717,0.9528,2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"..... I laughed my head off throughout.Was in two minds about watching because of some of the less than complimentary reviews, but glad I did, as it's one of the best comedies of recent years I've seen.Good performances all round, and the brothers are completely believable.Recommended."
" A family movie with classic comedy
",0.3612,0.8538,2020-12-24 00:00:00,9,"It really is a classic comedy movie. The Family looks for something different to get out of the routine but ends up getting into various confusions.The older brother is more silly and is constantly provoked by the younger brother, this is a little frustrating.The wife is extremely patient and the husband is clumsy.The combination of these elements makes the movie a delightful comedy to watch.I do not recommend taking the movie seriously, but it serves the purpose of amusing those who watch it."
" In line with the original
",0.3182,0.7906,2020-12-14 00:00:00,9,The same kind of timing and type or humor as in the original. Have seen it att least 10 times and still laugh as much as the first time.
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.8559,2020-12-11 00:00:00,1,Didn't even crack a smile. Awful script. Miss the old Family vacation movies. Also the younger son talking with a dumpster of a mouth ruined his character for me.
" Forgettable
",0.0,-0.6361,2020-12-11 00:00:00,3,I was highly disappointed by this movie. About the only thing I recall from it five years after seeing it was how stupid it was that the writers made the younger son so coarse and cursing thinking it would make people laugh. I remember people at the theater even commenting on how lame it was that the only thing the younger son did was curse. The older son wasn't a bad actor though. Too bad he wasted his talent here.
" One of the funniest family commedy
",0.5574,0.8271,2020-12-10 00:00:00,10,This is great stuff. I watched it so many times and every time I just laugh my butt off.
" Vacation
",0.0,0.9971,2020-12-09 00:00:00,8,"Ok I am a Big Original Vacation Fan. The Original Films are Fantastic Masterpieces.
But give credit were credit is do. Normally I hate when they mess up the Original Classic Films.
But in this case they did NOT different ""FAMILY"" but from the same Original ""Family"". Just the Newer generation. But off to the Classic ""Wally World"".
Love how they visit ""Grandpa and Grandma"" Awesome how it was Chevy Chase in a Cameo in the Film. Yes he was still a Clumbys mess up. Also his Wife was still in the Film. Love how it was the Two Original Couple in the Film. Just made that Film so much better. Oh and near the end of the Film when ""Grandpa"" sets them up with the car to go home with. I almost ""PISSED"" my pants as soon as he opened that Garage Door. It was sitting there all nice and shinning ready for the trip. It was Awesome bringing that Car back. I didn't expect that Lol. Yes the Young Director dear did his Homework on this Film. Love to see what he makes in the future. At least when he messes with the Classic Films. He does a pretty good job."
" A simple and pleasant comedy.
",0.7003,0.7636,2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"I don't expected a great comedy or something very new: Vacation is the continuation of the Vacation saga which began in 1983.
So Vacation is above all a family story, a couple with two boys and a road movie with a lot of incidents, encounters and surprises.
I enjoyed the peformances of Hels and Christina Applegate, two good actors.
It was also pleasant to see Chevy Chase and Beverly d'Angelo at the end of the story !!"
" So underrated
",0.0,0.9638,2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie is awesome as an over the top comedy, and so underrated. I would have loved another one for Christmas. As a sequel to The original as well... watching the original every year during December, and another would have been a great addition. The kids are probably too old now though.."
" Ginge gringe GRINGE
",0.0,0.6883,2020-11-14 00:00:00,1,I don't wanna see this movie ever again. I had high hopes but nope this was horrible
" Super underrated, don't pay attention to the nay-sayers
",0.6365,0.9966,2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is amazing. My husband and I saw it in the theater when it first came out and I absolutely loved it then and I still do. It's hilarious. Ed Helms is perfectly cast as Rusty. Christina Applegate is always great and the actors that play their kids are so funny. It's not a remake, and it's not family friendly (there's cussing, adult content and a tiny bit of nudity) but those are two things that just make it even better IMHO. The writers and actors just did a great job making it funny and giving it a solid storyline. It also has great cameos and some great call backs to the original. All around, it's amazing and deserves better reviews. People just love to over criticize reboots or new installments of movies from the 80's. That's what's going on here. Seriously, the movie is great."
" Cringe.
",0.0,-0.9663,2020-10-26 00:00:00,2,"Why remake this? A bored producer with no ideas, but means to assemble a cast?Nothing wrong with the cast, but the material they had was awful. Stale boring jokes. Predictable, painful, labored. It gets worse as it progresses.Goes to show that no matter how good the actors are, if the writing stinks it's game over."
" Lighthearted Comedy
",0.6486,0.8979,2020-10-18 00:00:00,6,It's a ride along the American highways with the weird family. A lot of adventures happen in the road trip where Russ tries to make everyone happy and bond as a family. Pretty fun.
" This is not a remake. It' more like a part 2 with throwbacks to the original
",0.624,0.8797,2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,"A remake is when they take the original movie and redo it. This is more like a Vacation 2. Footloose was a remake. Aliens and Aliens 2,3,4 etc were not remakes even though they were the same type of movie. They were another part of the story. This is how you pay homage to a great movie without ruining the original. By not recreating the original movie with the same characters you can have a different show. Remember how many people said that Ghostbusters would have been better casting the females in a future Ghostbusters as if they were the daughters of the original characters? It would probably still have been bad but it would have been less bad because it wasn't trying to recreate the original.Sure this movie had some throwbacks to the original but it was not the same movie. They should have called this Vacation 2 to stop people from calling this a remake.Anyway, the movie had it's moments where it was quite funny. It had it's moments where it was kind of gross. It had the throwback moments that had their own twist. Everything in this movie was decent quality. Even the CGI effects were pretty good."
" This is a great, funny and enjoyable movie!!!
",0.8951,0.9677,2020-10-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie is great and hilarious! The movie contains some inappropriate scenes but it is still great. I find the fact the the father is so pathetic and everyone can see it, this creates humour and cringe witch makes it a great movie with some hilarious scenes, I highly recommend this film!"
" Cameos
",0.0,0.9253,2020-09-29 00:00:00,1,This movie had a lot of cameos and surprises but not on the same level or as good as We Are The Millers. It was rooted from the same idea but whatever reason they think that a minor and children cussing and swearing is ok in movies and supposed to be funny and we the audience need accept it and chill and relax bro (Unacceptable). It's brainwashing our children generation for years to come.
" Surprisingly good.
",0.6249,0.8002,2020-09-16 00:00:00,7,"I'm a huge Vacation fan and I really wanted to hate this. So much, in fact, I actually put it off for 5 years and finally watched it just because.I'm kicking myself because this is actually a great comedy. I was laughing the whole time.Only rating it a 7 cuz it obviously doesn't compare to Anchorman or Superbad. But it's a high 7, I promise."

Whoever wrote this movie has got mental issues."
" Terrible!
",-0.5255,0.9377,2020-08-31 00:00:00,2,"This version of Vacation shows how bad most movie making is today. The original with Chevy Chase is a classic during a time when movies were well written and original, and actually made you laugh. Today they are unoriginal and they just throw as much vulgar and juvenile humor as possible and they think that's funny. I was hoping this movie would be decent, but it was just a waste of time. Just watch the original if you want to laugh and be entertained."
" Not enough fun to compensate for stupidity
",-0.681,0.6204,2020-08-21 00:00:00,3,"As title says, there is much more stupidity in this movie than fun. I was about to turn it off after 5 minutes of watching, but then something funny happened and I thought, ok, I'll give it a chance, and then again and again and finally the level of stupidity exceeded any possible limits and I turned it off. I generally liked Ed Helms, but in this movie he's horrible. All the other main actors are reasonable fine.Not recommended"

" I laughed my ars off.
",0.4588,0.9866,2020-07-22 00:00:00,9,"Crazy, hilarious things happen in this very funny film. Raunchy comedy remake which is funnier than the original; contemporary humor, easier to follow and with multiple Ed Helms freak out moments.
Yes, there are things in there which are hard-to-believe but who cares? This is a fictional comedy and not a documentary. Good cast, good cameos, funny jokes, odd situations and overall great entertainment; that's what you can expect from this movie.
The rating is too low here-very unfair. This is a great raunchy comedy which you might watch again and again! 9/10"
" Decent Film
",0.0,0.9834,2020-07-20 00:00:00,6,"The cast were more impressive than the film itself. So many cameos from some great actors so I feel the jokes could have been better. All the actors have been let down by some not so great writing. When it was funny, it was really funny but it lacked in some places. Such a waste of talent. The funniest bit for me was actually the opening credits when they were showing random pictures of people's holidays. And I hope those pictures were real because I laughed so hard at them."

The stinger for me was the frequent use of foul language by and in front of young children. I appreciate this isn't a family movie but it's not appealing or appropriate. Great movies don't need to resort to bad taste but this movie isn't even close to being good let alone great."
" Over hyped rubbish akin to 'The Hangover'...
",0.0,0.6646,2020-07-14 00:00:00,3,Didn't laugh once...This movie (judging by the raving reviews) is suffering the over hyped affliction of the 'Hangover' crap. The Hangover movies were not funny at all but were a massive success I imagine due to a large number of the audience possibly relating to it somehow. And that's it.This movie is the same. You have Ed Helms who is deeply irritating. Even in 'The Office' he was solely responsible for it going downhill. The guy literally IS NIT FUNNY but everyone thinks he is.This movie is hideous.
" Criminally Underrated.
",0.0,0.743,2020-07-08 00:00:00,9,My wife and I laughed until we had tears watching this. Others just want to slate it because it's the sequel to a classic. I loved it.

" One of those rare things - a decent spin off movie
",0.0,0.9925,2020-07-07 00:00:00,9,"I was a massive fan of the original Vacation films. They are something of a family tradition in our house from when we were kids, so I watched this with the understanding that nothing would beat those.
I was pleasantly surprised though.
The casting is just spot on. Ed Helms picks up the reins of Rusty flawlessly. Also, Christina Applegate is wonderful as usual. The appearance of Audrey and her husband was just hilarious.
The story throughout is predictable but still fun with some good laugh out loud moments, followed by some cringe moments and gentle nods to the originals. It keeps very much to the Vacation spirit of the older films.
Seeing Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo reprise their roles for those few scenes were just great. It really put the cherry on top of a very good and enjoyable film."
" This movie proves why sequels can be disasters
",-0.5574,-0.6249,2020-07-06 00:00:00,1,Watching this movie is worse than seeing a train wreck. Ed Helms tries far too hard to be funny and the humor is forced. Watching the original with Chevy Chase you cheer for the family despite their dysfunctional ways and hilarious situations.In this update you hate the family from the beginning and it worsens with the absurd car he rents and then the lack of humor in the entire movie.One star is too high a rating.

In this Vacation remake, Clark Griswold's son Rusty takes the helm and takes his family on a vacation. If you're a big 'Married With Children"" fan and loved Kelly Bundy, Christina Applegate plays the wife and you can watch this movie, but apart from that, there's the hilarious scene with Chris Hemsworth and the character Adena, played by beautiful Catherine Missal, this wasn't worth watching.

Yes, it's very predictable and hardly any jokes are revolutionary, but there were still parts I found funny. I guess mostly because I've had my fair share of bad vacations too. And my university drinking skills are not what they used to be either.So all in all, I enjoyed it. Nothing spectacular and no need to pause when you go to the bathroom, but enjoyable."

" Laughed the entire movie
",0.4588,0.9468,2020-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Had seriously low expectations of the film, but found myself laughing throughout the movie. It's not a remake, but stands alone as it's comedy respectfully spoofing off the original (such as with the hot woman in the convertible on the highway). The casting is great.The youngest son with his use of the plastic bags had me absolutely roaring.It's not a kids movie (since when is a rated ""R"" movie considered for families?) so those ""shocked"" by the raunchy humor must have forgotten the original movie with nudity and it's own sexual jokes and ""R"" rating."

And I suppose that's what the movie is but it stands up on its own and sure there's a few throwbacks for comedic effect, they work well, the blonde in the Ferrari springs to mind...
The car is an absolute wonder and the keyfob!!
Brilliant, just brilliant.
It's funny, very dry, clever American comedy. Nice pace and good flow.
Thankfully Chevy appears in it...as he should do.
There's one scene that had me howling with laughter.
I'm just going to say...""What's your pet rats name?""

",0.5035,-0.0271,2020-04-09 00:00:00,6,"This movie was okay to watch. The humor in this movie is low in quality but makes you laugh anyways, because most of the jokes and the humor used in the movie is so bad that it's good. I guess that's how you can describe this movie: so good that it's bad. I don't want to discredit anyone who worked on this movie, because it doesn't get lost on me how much work, time and effort goes into making a movie. The keyplayers for this movie were the actors, especially Christina Applegate and Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stibbs (the two guys who played the boys). Besides from the humor (which at times felt a little out of place or overkill), there's not really a big character development happening besides from some lukewarm ones, or a big storyline. The entire movie is about a family changing their vacationplans and the entire trip going wrong untill the family reaches their destination and find out that everything wasn't as bad as they thought because they could ride this one rollercoaster. I guess you can expect that from this kind of movie."

" The 'Vacation' Story For A New Generation, With A Likable Cast & Updated Laughs.
",0.4939,0.9739,2019-12-31 00:00:00,6,"It's tough to re-make a film that most of the world loved. I have seen the original 'Vacation' series many times, and my family watches 'Christmas Vacation' (1989) every holiday season. People get territorial about holiday traditions and classic films, so my family wasn't buying this new re-make. It kinda sucks viewing a movie with pepole, knowing that they are actively TRYING to hate it - especially when it's a comedy. And, at the end of the day, my family was wrong to prejudge this film. 'Vacation' (2015) is more than ""just another re-make"", and can stand on it's own merit as a fine comedy.Ed Helms was a great choice to play the lead. I mean, Chevy Chase was funny, but everyone knew he was a total d*** in real life. Ed Helms is funnier than Chevy Chase, and his co-workers actually like him. My family may not have liked this movie, but they've never watched 'The Office' (2005), so their opinion of comedy in 2019 is completely irrelevant. For real, the days of making excuses are long past us - at this point, if you haven't watched every episode of 'The Office' (2005), in order, then you don't want to laugh and you don't really like comedic entertainment.If you are progressive minded, embrace change, and like to laugh - this movie is for you! If you are old, conservative, and only interested in re-living your past - just skip all the complaining and re-watch the original for the 78th time.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Awkward.I enjoyed the movie though. It was a fun family experience. It had fun parts throughout. Lots to keep you involved and entertained.Would probably recommend a viewing sometime.

An attempt to revive the original classic Vacation from the 80's just didn't work at all. Way to much profanity, especially by the children in the film. A plot that is lost in all kinds of stupid trashy types of situations and worst of all, way to much toilet humor. I can't even rate this because it doesn't even deserve a single star. I watched it once and threw it in the trash. Thank God it's out of my house!"
" Amazingly funny.

I've read some reviews saying that it was super bad but I liked the trailer so I decided to give it a chance and to be honest I'm so glad I did. It was one of the funniest movies I've seen. Everyone in it does a good job but really the script and the jokes are incredible. I think people don't like it because it a humor that maybe considered offensive sometimes but if you don't have a problem with some dark humor then you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did. This is a 10 for me. Almost every single joke landed perfectly.

PsychopathsRape/PedophiliaJoking around about killing someone by trying to kill them knowing that someone probably won't die because they'll fight back so it will be funny and you won't try super hard at killing them because it's a joke!Sorority sex/drug pledgesBullyingBalls of pubic hairChild molestersSexual promiscuityHence, I didn't really enjoy this movie.
I'm a sucker for gutter humor and I'm not easily offended but this was just creepy. It wasn't even easy potty humor. It was just weird. I'm shocked so many people think this is funny. Maybe I'm the weird one?I'm not saying across the board don't watch this. I'm saying if you don't think these type of things are funny, don't watch this- you won't like this movie; but if you do (obviously people do) then you probably will like this movie.I'm also a sucker for remakes, especially homages to a genre, but this falls flat. It doesn't have the same -I don't know- the same... je ne sais quoi? feel as the Chevy Chase classics. It also doesn't have the originality to stand on its own. It's reaching for the original Vacation coattails but it can't even ride on those because they're just out of reach. Sigh. Super disappointing.Best new comedy film I've seen in awhile: The Ant-Man and The Wasp
Best new sitcom: The Kids Are Alright (one season only, ABC)

" Adolescent humor at its most gross.
",-0.3167,0.9151,2019-05-06 00:00:00,5,"There are a couple of genuinely inspired moments in Vacation. Unfortunately, they are so grossly outnumbered by segments that are offensively unfunny and cringe-worthy that you may well miss them the first time you watch this film. At times you will chuckle but more often you will wonder if this script was actually written by adults and not a group of fourteen-year-old boys. If your idea of humor is little boys dropping the F-bomb, people slathering themselves in excrement, and drunk ladies vomiting (to name but a few of the 'witty' plot devices employed here) then you will love this. If your tastes are more mature then you will have to work a bit harder to find the humor. It is there, just well camouflaged and infrequent.I don't usually focus on the opening and closing credits of a movie, but these are so abominable they deserve special mention. The expletive ridden music is particularly offensive and totally unnecessary. Still, I guess it lets you know what to expect from the movie to come.Sadly, I can't recommend this movie to anyone. You are either going to love it or hate it. There's no middle ground."

" If You Loved the Original ... !
",0.7574,0.9899,2019-01-26 00:00:00,7,"... you'll really like this sequel, which pays more than copious homages to the first Vacation (1983). It very studiously and unashamedly just updates things to a 21st century setting, before letting Rusty Griswold's family run rampant across various American landscapes and landmarks in yet another Walley World quest.Ed Helms channels Chevy Chase to perfection, even down to the (disastrous) father/son talks he received from his dad in the first film. Christina Applegate looking like Beverly D'Angelo (1983) also gives a very appealing sexy/funny performance. And the two antagonistic sons, the younger a foul-mouthed bully of the elder, a young SNAG, just trying to find his place in the world, are frequently hilarious in their interactions.Thank goodness the producers decided against trying to tone down the raw humour in an effort to get a PG rating. The adult humour works far better and is imbued with a kid-like sense of fun. I'm sorry, but for me, the PG sequels in the franchise, whilst undoubtedly having their funny moments, always seemed unnecessarily antiseptic in feeling.Some of the cameos are terrific. Michael Pena and friends playing the four clashing interstate cops must have found it hard to keep straight faces. Chris Hemsworth, very much again sending his star persona up, playing Rusty's very wealthy Texan brother-in-law, Stone Crandall demonstrates the comedic credentials, he so well utilised in Thor: Ragnarok. Ironically, the expected appearances of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo served more as a transition between scenes, rather than as an independently comical episode.The critics generally panned this movie, but if you feel you have the taste, it's highly recommended that you go the full course with the Griswolds."
" Great revival of National Lampoons
",0.6249,0.6249,2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,"I think the low score on here is because younger reviewers have never seen the originals.
All the crazyness of the 80s with a modern touch.
Christina Applegate still looks amazing.
I nearly wet myself when Griswald jr was driving like Chevy Chase.
But it is maybe sad indictment of today that they kids had never heard of Seal/Batman.

",-0.4329,0.8374,2018-12-18 00:00:00,6,"I Love R rated comedy movies. I absolutely love them, but this, this was a bit of a disappointment. Out the entire runtime there was only about 10-15 minutes of enjoyable scenes. One of the only good things about this film was the cameos which i absolutely loved. Speaking of cameos Charlie Day was in this one for about 8 minutes. The reason im bringing it up is because Charlie Day is one of my favorite actors but this movie just did him wrong. He scenes weren't funny at all and felt kind of pointless, like the rest of this movie. I've never seen the original Vacation film but i feel like this one is a disgrace to that one. The movie was just dragging and dragging along. I kept pausing the TV to see how much longer i had to put up with it. Overall this movie is a bit of a waste of time. Its not talked about too much and now i see why."
" Hilarious Fun!
",0.7424,0.9881,2018-12-16 00:00:00,9,"This isn't a movie for children, obviously since it's rated r, so the idiots saying don't take your kids to see it should be ignored entirely. Things change in the world, movies and television shows aren't going to be the same as they were 30 years ago. Either adapt with the times or stay home and watch something on VHS. It's clearly just a movie so a 10 year old cursing doesn't have to be taken so damn seriously. Ed Helms and Christina Appelgate are great together and I enjoyed their chemistry. They played on a lot of the memorable moments from the originals but also created their own and succeeded in entertaining my friends and I. I always loved the Vacation movies and I still do. This one is definitely a modern take on those movies but like I said it still pays homage to the ones that came before it. If you take movies that seriously then yes don't see it because no one cares if you were offended by a film consisting of fictional characters and events. Otherwise if you're not a snowflake then definitely give this a try!"

",0.2144,0.9878,2018-11-17 00:00:00,6,"Movie is definitely one of the best physical comedies I've watched in a long time, but 2/3rds of the way into the movie, you realize that the humor is all gallows. Every joke involves death and in hindsight the movie itself is pretty grim. I think that's why the humor is so effective here (it's half-acting as a coping mechanism).It was also nice seeing cameos from the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia crew. Charlie was especially hilarious as a deranged water rafting instructor and the police scene with Deandra is arguably the funniest in the entire film.Definitely worth a watch for Helms fans or for people who enjoy Anchorman-style comedy."

One of the Funniest movies We have ever seen partly due to the fact that these are real life situations that anyone could find themselves in...especially with my own family...Im not kidding :) From the hilarious Tartan Prancer, The Raft trip, The Hotsprings, & the overnight stay at the sister's house we laughed till we cried...One of the best movies we have ever seen.

",0.0,-0.9975,2018-09-08 00:00:00,1,"Vacation is a mess. It's an absolute mess. It's a rushed, irritating, and unpleasant mess that shames the Vacation franchise in the worst imaginable way possible. From its lack of coherent humor and storytelling, to its aggravating, bumbling, and disinteresting characters, the movie fails to utilize its potential with lame timing and unenthusiastic directing. Before the movie was over, audiences would immediately regret accepting to join these idiots on their trip to Walley World.The protagonist is an absolute moron and you'll hate him including his stupid family too. Although his wife may have small redeemable qualities, she's however too oblivious to realize just how profoundly stupid everyone among her was. Only their oldest child attempts to question anything but he too isn't saved from being portrayed as a goofy dork. However, the worst offender is their youngest child. The moment this little runt appears on screen it becomes the most hateful experience ever. Audiences would want him dead before he actually commits a crime as with other actual offenses throughout this disaster.Everyone and everything sucks in this movie. They're either annoying, stupid, unnecessary, or unlikable. Nothing goes by unquestioned, nobody receives enough consequences for their stupid behavior, and this was merely an active crime scene for the Vacation franchise. It was a mistake to create this film and this family would be blacklisted nationwide if they actually existed. But that's probably not far from the truth since stupidity doesn't discriminate.Don't take a vacation with these morons. Stay home."

",0.765,0.9935,2018-07-31 00:00:00,8,"Do not let the 6.1 star rating here in imdb fool you, for a modern road trip comedy this was amazing. Rarely have i seen a comedy with so many original scenes and witty dialogue, the producers of this movie have really tried hard to stay away from comedy movie cliches to create something fresh and funny. Ed Helms is simply amazing in this movie, if you like his roles in ''The Office'' or ''Hangover'', expect the same character here, he surely has not lost his charm and talent over the years. For some reason this movie feels a bit different when compared to other modern comedies of this type, it certainly brings something fresh to the table in a genre almost impossible to bring anything new to.
 
 This movie is obviously a bit over the top, awkward and cringy at times, but that plays out greatly when Ed Helms is the main character, of course, Ed Helms delivers his classic awkward cringe worthy character perfectly making this into an amazing modern comedy. Do not look at the bad reviews and ratings, this is a great, action packed, funny comedy that is worth seeing!"
" Nice nd funny movie
",0.6908,0.9439,2018-07-30 00:00:00,8,Very funny and I laughed a lot. Do not expect a work of art but a funny movie where you enjoy it from the beginning to an end. Recommend it.
" Clearly there is a market for this ""type"" of movie.
",0.4019,0.9921,2018-06-18 00:00:00,2,"This movie in my own opinion completely missed a perfect opportunity to bring out a new franchise of some future features. But this movie was just bottom of the barrel, pathetic and dumb resorting to an almost humor which a 12 year old would laugh at, a humor not too distant from fart and dick 'n' ball gags. 
I am very fortunate enough like many to love the original Vacations where the humour still stands up to today's standards. 
with the great success of the Hangover Ed Helms played the character well as did Christina Applegate and even the older son, but the younger kid was just over the top and I don't blame him for that, the writing and director take that responsibility. 
The plot was traditional, the 7 minute joke based around the car Rusty had rented was nothing more than a silly filler gag which again for me missed the mark.The CB radio gag, the university stop all seemed ok but again I just feel the writer Jonathan Goldstein as impressive as his resume is just wanted to make a slop movie. 
There didn't seem to be a sense of direction in the film between characters, Rusty is clearly supposed to be the glue, but that kinda just doesn't reflect in the movie. 
I tried hard not to compare to the originals but it's hard when this is supposed to be the ""new"" generations of Griswold's and therefore some kinda of magic from the originals should have rubbed off, but it didn't.
I've seen it once and like many forgettable movies it will find its way in a place where many years from now when references the Vacation movies the only ones that will be mentioned will be the originals."
" Grossly Underrated
",-0.2263,0.9682,2018-06-14 00:00:00,9,"Seriously, if everyone would just chill tfo about wanting to compare this version with the original version, you would find this movie is hilarious. First time in years I didn't want to punch Ed Helms in the face after watching him in a movie. The two actors who play the boys in the movie are great. But the gem and queen of this movie is Christina Applegate. All in all, a really funny movie, a lot better than internet trolls have shown it. I just hope the 100 million worldwide gross will generate a remake of Xmas Vacation. I will admit that Chris Hemsworth, Charlie Day, Kaitlyn Olson, Michael Pena, Nick Kroll, either Key or Peele, are great in their own small role way. However, this movie does not provide the Cousin Ed role made famous by Canadian truffle sniffer Randy Quaid."

However, this was different, I couldn't even watch the whole movie it was so freaking bad, it is so mean-spirited and painfully unfunny that it's unwatchable. The family is incredibly unlikable and the attempts at humor are excruciatingly painful. Only watch this film if you want to see an absolute trainwreck that fails on every level. Don't waste your time, on this utter trash! My Final Rating: 1/10"
" FUNNY and heartfelt at times
",0.7983,0.8471,2018-06-05 00:00:00,8,"Only reviewing because of the onslaught of people who apparently thought an R-rated film based on another R-rated film that was produced by National Lampoon of all things was appropriate to take their children to see. The original movie was released when I was 11 and I clearly recall my anger at being told I wasn't old enough to go see it with my brother (though the real reason was probably that he didn't want me tagging along. :-) ). Anyway, this movie has some really laugh-out-loud moments. It's not sophisticated humor - it's ""in-your-face"" humor that doesn't require a lot of effort which is pretty perfect on a Saturday night after spending the day in the sun at the pool. And, again, how is it this film's fault that parents think any movie featuring a family is appropriate to take their kids to see??? Not smart. If you like silly humor, you'll enjoy this. Movies like Snatched, Office Christmas Party, Game Night - these are not life changing movies but they make you laugh and god knows we need that now more than ever. If you're terribly sheltered with poor judgement, go see something G-rated and if you are so very enlightened, take in another viewing of - insert Wes Anderson movie title here. Sheesh."

We're talking about trying to capture the essence of classic comedy films. It sucks because I truly do like all the actors involved in this film, but still... However it did have some redeeming factors and good jokes in an attempt to do its own thing, but not really. It's time to stop trying to redo classic comedy films."

Sure, a large part of it was very predictable, but, it tried with others, and I appreciated that.Overall, Vacation was pretty much what I always expected it to be, and it met those expectations quite well. Usually these road trip type comedy flicks, filled with a bunch of unnecessary spectacle end up feeling way too long, even with their usual 1 hr 30 min running time, but this film filled up that time with some palatable content for the most part. 5.7/10.P.S.

When the neighbors are over for dinner, he sees an enormous amount of father-son bonding, that he become envious and realizes his family is in a rut. He decides a vacation to Wally World (and not Paris) is what the family needs and announces to the audience ""The new vacation will stand on its own.""His family is a bit dysfunctional. We discover his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) was known as ""Debbie do anything"" in college. As a side note, I don't believe there is a Memphis State University, but the University of Memphis is a dry campus. Kevin (Steele Stebbins) the younger son swears excessively, wrestles, and likes to bully his older brother James. James (Skyler Gisondo) who ""doesn't have a vag.., but it would be okay if he did"", keeps a wish diary.The film was funny. The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.Guide: Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity."

I understand some people may find that funny, but I find it absolutely unnecessary and not funny at all. Haha, potty mouth kid, hilarious....not really. 
I grew up with the National Lampoon Vacation movies as my families favorite thing to watch together. I will not be showing my future children this movie as it is really not funny and stupid.

However, the filmmakers created an unofficial star with the vehicle. The Family Truckster of the original was funny, but only as a prop, but the erstwhile Tartan Prancer from Albania is the most awesome piece of fictional automotive film history I've ever seen. It IS the star of the film, hands down. If you are wavering on watching this film, watch it once just for this mini-van, I implore you. I gotta get me that GPS. Many individual scenes of the movie are not bad, mind you and Ed Helms and Christina Applegate were well-cast. But overall, the movie didn't work. The few high points were offset with many low points. The good jokes are very good but many others don't hit their mark.Watch it for the mini-van!"

It's full of silly gags, ridiculous situations and eccentric characters.The problem is that there's nothing in this movie that hasn't already been done before. It's funny the first time, but when the same jokes are repeated over and over, they start to wear thin.'Vacation' works as a time-passer, it's watchable and despite the lack of originality in the humour it does provide the odd decent laugh. Comedies like this are mass produced nowadays and unfortunately this one will soon be forgotten about. Just another generic comedy movie packed full of the same old jokes."

Christina Applegate plays the mother while Skyler Gisondo & Steele Stebbins play the sons. Leslie Mann appears as Ed's sister and Chris Hemsworth her hunky hubby, whom the Griswolds visit in Texas.The plot is great for a sequel to the classic 1983 film with Chevy Chase & Beverly D'Angelo, who appear here in the last act. Unfortunately, I was turned off right out of the gate by the younger Griswold's crude verbiage and non-jokes, which seemed more fitting for a nasty sitcom like ""Two Broke Girls."" Thankfully, the punk has a story arc where he eats some humble pie later.Despite that negative, there are about four laugh-out-loud sequences: The sorority episode, parts of the Crandall segment (which feature Mann & Hemsworth), the howling hilarious raft sequence and the closing Walley World brouhaha & roller coaster fiasco. Have you ever waited 2-3 hours for a freakin' roller coaster ride? It's ridiculous. In addition, the flick scores pretty well on the female front, particularly (to be expected) during the sorority segment.While I could do without the tasteless non-humor and profanity (mostly from the little punk), I found this one far funnier than the original movie. Plus the way it supports family and marriage underneath the zany laughs is almost heartwarming. Too bad the creators felt they had to add so much foulness because (1.) it's not funny and (2.) it wasn't necessary. THE FILM RUNS 99 minutes and was shot in Chicago, Georgia (Atlanta, Covington & Six Flags in Austell), North Carolina (Charlotte), Utah (Kanab), Arizona (Marble Canyon) and California (San Francisco).GRADE: B- (6.5/10)"

It's full of filthy unnecessary language, stupid scenarios, and vile, unlikable characters. The youngest son is by far the most obnoxious, unrealistic, unpleasant brat I've seen in any movie. The character is just not funny.No spoilers here, just an opinion that if you liked the previous vacation movies, you're going to be so disappointed in this one.

Helms might look goofy but he does not have the comedic skills of Chevy Chase and even his screen wife Christina Applegate out acts him here.

It is not that I am 'easily offended' but most people these days seem to be offended by nothing. This film is, literally, an offense. To make child actors use obscene language is tantamount to child abuse. Hollywood should pay a price for this. Instead? They make money and are encouraged to commit more crimes like ""Vacation"". Hollywood: see if you can write a script without profanity. Try it. I know it will be difficult for you. It will also shorten run times by 20 minutes. Not only is this movie a moral disgrace but it is also just bad. There is none of the innuendo and irony of the original movie but mere 'hammer humour' at it's nauseating worst."

The original film had a story in which there were character arcs, lessons learned, and the humor came from the characters rather than simply artificially constructed moments or constant use of supposedly shocking words by kids. What angers me is that a remake could easily have been done that at least showed some appreciation of what made the original a great and funny film but instead millions were poured into absolute crap. Disrespectful of the original, poorly acted, horrible sets (the four corners bit looked like a elementary school production), and pathetic acting make this a miss in every way conceivable."
" Forgettable and unfunny
",0.0,0.9581,2017-06-16 00:00:00,2,"Vacation is essentially an R rated less than family version of several Adam Sandler comedy films. Having been compared to 2013's surprise hit We're the Millers, Vacation is neither as good or funny as that film in roughly every area. Vacation was no hit but having a budget of $30 million and making a little over $100 million worldwide, it made some success. Though studios most likely looked at the success of We're the Millers and that film making over $269 million worldwide, Vacation is a disappointment and the studios must have expected more. It appeared obvious this film was headed for a sequel but having roughly weak numbers, it remains not to receive another sequel to this follow up.Vacation isn't funny and most of the gags come off across as desperate and cringe worthy. Having an R-rated, one can tell they used it to their advantage as there is an overload of cursing and sexual innuendos. R-rated comedies are great and work when the material is funny and the jokes hit, but in Vacation the jokes fall flat and they feel very forced. The plot of this film is relatively simple and basic, with typical ""disasters and problems"" occurring on the family's way to their journey of Walley World (a large familiar theme park). Overall, this film appears to be have forgotten as we hope directors and the studios have learned their proper dues when it comes to r-rated family comedies."

I was worried about the fact that this was set around Rusty Griswold as the main character, now all grown up, but it actually worked out well enough.There is a lot of hilarious scenes throughout this movie, just as there was with the older movies. And the comedy in this movie was right on the head, keeping very much in the traditions of the older movies. And that was a great thing, because it kept a great continuity to the movie as it carried on the legacy.Ed Helms (playing Rusty Griswold) and Christina Applegate (playing Debbie Griswold) were actually carrying the movie quite well. And they had some good help from Skyler Gisondo (playing James Griswold) and Steele Stebbins (playing Kevin Griswold). Then there were some nice appearances by Chris Hemsworth (playing Stone Crandall) and Leslie Mann (playing Audrey Crandall; formerly Audrey Griswold). But most importantly, there could be no ""Vacation"" movie without Chevy Chase (playing Clark W. Griswold) and Beverly D'Angelo (playing Ellen Griswold). Oh, and I almost forgot to mention a hilarious appearance by none other than Norman Reedus (playing the trucker).I was laughing a lot throughout the course of this movie, and the comedy was great and right up my alley. So this turned out to be a very nice movie indeed. And my initial fears of a failure to carry on the torch were put to shame.If you enjoyed the classic ""Vacation"" movies, then you should definitely also take the time to watch the 2015 ""Vacation""."
