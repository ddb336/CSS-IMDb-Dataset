This person is not of this world that is how fine the writing is, everything in this is extra-fine, precious really , this could be a book , whatever this guy writes will be good cause he has the magic , no matter what medium , this is a true star! believe that!"
" Phenomenal
",0.0,-0.3182,2020-08-26 00:00:00,10,"Completely blew me away. Characters are complex and three-dimensional. Writing is snappy and smart.The pivotal party is SO absurd and over-the-top as to be unbelieva- oh wait, no it's sadly incredibly realistic.Mandatory viewing."
" Terrible racist title
",-0.7964,0.3182,2020-08-22 00:00:00,1,Dear makers of this movie - little tip; if you want to attract an audience - try to come up with a title that doesn't alienate your watchers into eye rolling territory. It is a terrible strategy based on pseudo-moralistic far left ideas that are already unpalatable.
" Uncomfortable, but grinning..
",-0.2023,0.9513,2020-06-18 00:00:00,10,"I had been meaning to watch this for a while and yet had no idea about the plot of the movie before watching it.First up... I am a white people, this review of course is affected by that.It's the subtle things that get it this score from me.
The quality of the acting is spot on. The plot takes it's twists and turns and had me giggling and gasping and throwing my hands up in surprise.
The clever directing, the use of Emphasis in dialog, genuinely served to fuel things to greater heights.And the little references to future events.This is a work of art and a glorious one at that.I can see how it hits far too close to home for comfort for a lot of (white) people, as there were moments wherein I was profoundly uncomfortable, but that doesn't take away from the sheer quality of this film.There's complexity and beauty in this.It's wonderful."
" Quite good, but pales in comparison with the TV series
",0.2724,0.9725,2019-10-03 00:00:00,7,"I saw this movie after watching the first, brilliant season of the TV series it spawned, and that makes it difficult to review. Because the TV series is so brilliant, so funny, so nuanced, and so well structured, I can't help but see the movie as a dress rehearsal for what was to come. Would I have enjoyed this movie more had I seen it first? Very possibly.The movie follows a whole bunch of characters as they deal with issues around race, with black characters ranging from revolutionaries to blend-inners and white characters ranging from supportive to racist to really, really racist.The movie is hugely ambitious, and director Justin Simien wants to squeeze in every idea he's ever had about race into this movie. Unfortunately, the result often feels overstuffed, with too many characters and too many ideas packed into too little space.Clearly, Simien needed a TV series. In that, he takes the same ideas and is able to fully explore each one and each character, in wonderful detail.The movie is certainly well worth seeing, but unlike the TV series, I wouldn't call this essential viewing."
" Your two hours can be better spent
",0.4404,-0.8807,2018-08-29 00:00:00,3,"Obnoxious, pointless, boring, boring, boring, unrelatable. This movie lost its plot about twenty minutes in and was trying to be loud rather than actually having a point to make."
" By any means necessary
",0.0,0.9688,2018-02-17 00:00:00,5,"This is a movie I thought I would love, but fell flat on comedy and purpose. The film centers on black students at a fictional Ivy League college. There is a Vlog called ""Dear White People"" which tells white people what black people think...as if they care. One of the funnier lines was that you now need two black friends to not be a racist and Tyrone who sells you weed doesn't count. Yup. That was a real knee slapper.Sam White (Tessa Thompson) is a bi-racial student, they actually used the word ""mulatto"" horrors! She has race identity issues and must over compensate. While the college wants to integrate students, she wants to maintain a black house to maintain black culture. She hates Tyrone Perry movies that stereo-type black people. And white people who use the term African-American instead of black so they don't seem racist are racist.The characters and plot really didn't evolve that well. The black face ""riot"" that occurred was a let down and the message was confused. Perhaps the confused message is that race relations is stalled at crossroads, pulling in a number of directions.The best part of the film was the silent movie shown within the film. Most of the drama of the film I found artificial and boring. ""Black or White"" or even ""Supremacy"" are better and more realistic films about race relations.Guide: F-bomb, N-word, implied sex."
" An inconsistent farce, but worthwhile nonetheless
",0.3071,0.8765,2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I found myself thinking that this film felt less than realistic (because it was a farce) or less than current (because it borrowed so heavily from Spike Lee's 90s joints). But then the credits roll and you remember: we're still here...we're still having this conversation about our identities and ourselves. There's nothing post-racial about 2015, and this film prods and pokes and laughs and jokes until we get that. It's not realistic, but it is real."
" Okay. Should have been better.
",0.5859,0.9848,2017-10-14 00:00:00,6,"This is not a perfect film but it is entertaining and interesting. But more importantly it is very necessary considering everything going on today plus I didn't even know some on the college campuses were actually hosting racist-a## parties like that. But anyway, the film has an excellent concept behind it but it is poorly executed. However, like I said before this is such an important topic and you do not see Hollywood doing anything about it until someone twists their arm. Long story short, a better director would have done a lot more with the material."
" Give it a few episodes
",0.0,0.8402,2017-08-24 00:00:00,7,"It's satire, so of course it's full of stereotypes. It's a pretty good show. You have to get through the first episode to realize it's a framework to build a story of all of their interactions and personal stories. It's semi-successful because mixing satire with a dramedy isn't really a thing that blends easy."
" Racist garbage
",-0.6124,0.7297,2017-07-31 00:00:00,1,"Entire movie is based upon the hatred of white people. Another gem straight from netflix trying to make whites feel guilty about being white. If you enjoy racially bigotry, this movie might appeal to you. If you think it's OK to classify an entire race as idiots, you might like this movie. Could you imagine what would happen if a movie was created titled ""Dear black people""?"
" Interesting look at a complex issue
",0.4019,-0.9843,2017-07-27 00:00:00,7,"I'm truly puzzled by the bad reviews and ire this movie garnered. It deals with some very complex issues - for example: is having on-campus housing which is exclusively for black students segregation or culturally aware? ""Dear White People"" isn't great film-making ... but it tackles difficult issues which are NOT black and white (pun intended) ... but rather many shades of gray. Some reviewers slammed the movie for being racist. Huh? People want to live in a bubble and pretend racism no longer exists. The pictures of real life ""black-face parties"" on various college campuses which rolled on the ending credits show that racism is alive and well -just more insidious since we are supposed to be ""past"" it. ""Dear White People"" isn't racist ... but it is about racism. I think most of the bad reviews were from people who didn't like their ""racism is no longer an issue"" bubble burst. The movie was a bit heavy-handed in places but I liked the characters. I enjoyed the sense of irony and humor."
" This show is...
",0.0,-0.6836,2017-05-07 00:00:00,5,"I found that it is rather evident that people who have rated this low, have not given this show much more than a five minute watch. It quite explains the reason for the title, in the last few minutes. It shows that the reason it's alright for this sort of joking, is because well...Watch the show and you'll find out. I rather enjoyed this episode, it proved powerful at the end.The story writing as a whole, is decent. It shows potential for character growth, and folks looking to watch it should give it a thorough go, vs an angry opinion based on the title alone. It goes to show, that racism is alive folks. And no, this isn't a show that is somehow ""reverse racist"" (because in honesty, that makes no real sense...wouldn't that be the reverse of racism in general? And a good thing?)"
" A supreme case of wasted opportunity to make a difference.
",0.4939,-0.8702,2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"I watched,with great pain,the pitifully biased and nonsensical film that attempted to elevate the discourse on real racism and its presence in our world. Well funded and full of passion,it simply shows whites as the worst people,ever. The black people in the film,ironically,came off just one half a notch less awful. Im a glass half full type,so I have more optimism than the cynic that penned this thing,but the answer to this problem is NOT to write a film that portrays whites as whiskey drinking KKK types with greasy hair and hate in their hearts. The only answer is truth. Pursue it. This is NOT the truth. Just a slant."
" Well directed but riddled with hateful undertones
",-0.5789,-0.934,2017-02-26 00:00:00,3,"There's not much to say, honestly, the stereotypes, the racism, the bigotry, all run rampant. There's a line where satire crosses into racism, and this film crosses that line to the point of uncomfortable spitefulness. I understand why the film was done and what the overlying plot of the film is. The director here is aiming for us to feel sorry for black culture as well as to understand the plight of what the race is going through, but the director fails to realize the most important things, there are no reputable characters in this whole wobbled premise, and everyone within the film, minus the writer, is someone you can actually care for. This film, putting it lightly, is positively excrement in it's purest form. Taking a shot at our institutions of higher learning and labeling it as ""satire"" is both irresponsible and negligent, and if people honestly believe in what this director has put on screen, with a series to follow on Netflix, full of the same plot lines, it's no wonder why there are so many riots and protests. The public will buy into anything if you put enough hate into it."
" Important subject matter completely miscalculated
",0.2263,0.7597,2017-02-06 00:00:00,4,"'Dear White People' is a film that is probably hindered from the start by the enormous weight on it's shoulders; it wants to address the severe racial tensions in the US while also instigating a resurgence of African American independent filmmaking to overpower the trend of low-brow, unimportant exploitation comedies. The film fails to fulfill either of these aims. From the very start of the film, propelled by Tessa Thompson's incendiary (but not in the fun, edgy way it wants to be) 'dear white people' one-liners from which the film's title derives, a mean- spirited attitude is adopted that, despite being introduced as a satire, never has a punchline. The dialogue feels more like practiced zingers that the writer/director wrote in the back of his notebook in college than naturalistic discourse of disgruntled youth, and the characterization, despite desperately trying to engage the audience in drawn out, repetitive sequences, is minimized to the very stereotypes that the film tries to conquer (one character who counter- intuitively emulates the separatism of Malcolm X is directly addressed as being a wannabe). That's not to say that the film has no positive aspects. Tyler James Williams portrays the character of Lionel with deft subtlety, and has a standout moment in the film's denouement that is likely the most memorable image two days after seeing it. Furthermore, the confrontation between Troy and his father by a poolside sees Dennis Haysburt give a excruciatingly real performance that is drenched with a pained past of subjugation. The sentiment of not giving people the satisfaction of living up to their stereotypes resonated with me significantly.Tessa Thompson also shows a degree of range that would culminate in her far superior performance in Creed. However, this range is treated with such jarring carelessness that her third-act character arc appears to emerge from nowhere, leaving us as dumbfounded as her cohorts when she refuses to take on the leadership role she has clamored for the entire first hour.The film attempts to appeal to a community of people that have dealt with oppression for centuries and still face resistance from the white community when the conversation about racism is brought to the table. It is more than understandable that these issues should be brought to light, as the shocking images during the end credits of the film make clear, and the film is at its best when it teases the obvious hypocrisy that exists in white sensationalizing of black culture when the reality is so bleak for so many. However, it manages only to rub more salt in the wound by demonizing the very people it tries to communicate with (the satire here is treated so poorly it becomes venomous), and the laughs are so few and far between in the slogging narrative that the film becomes more negatively charged than it intends to be. Perhaps in the hands of a more experienced and visionary filmmaker, this film could be elevated into political and social relevance to the same extent of Spike Lee's early works (which the film is begging for you to associate it with), however as it stands, this film will probably fade into obscurity as another misstep in the pursuit of a meaningful discourse and a more representative Hollywood."
" Not for the close minded.
",0.0,0.9927,2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"It's a Satirical Comedy. Some people may be offended by the candid nature of the material. I think the writers and cast handled the subject matter in a very mature fashion. I was initially jarred, yes. But then I kept watching. I noticed I have had a few shared experiences and feelings regarding some of the things depicted. Great cast who carry the material with the grace and care it deserves. Definitely a conversation starter. Relationship end-er depending on the crowd.I think most people can relax and enjoy a laugh. Admit we live in a VERY PC society. Your reaction to this film may show your true colors."
