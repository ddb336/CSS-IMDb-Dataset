" Stinker
",-0.3612,-0.9042,2021-02-28 00:00:00,3,"Plot holes a plenty....how did he get out of the police station?
SLJ could have phoned in his serial killer character...he probably did.
Stupid police officers and a bad script."
" Entertaining but stupid
",-0.5647,-0.2387,2020-11-26 00:00:00,5,So here's the thing...there are so many things that make this movie ridiculous and yet somehow entertaining. The story is interesting but implausible. There are so many inconsistencies. Why not call the cops when someone broke into his house? Why would someone run across a field instead of getting in his car? Okay to watch while folding laundry!
" The acting was good and storyline decent
",0.4404,0.6066,2020-07-25 00:00:00,6,"The acting was good and storyline decent, unfortunately the music was way too loud and clunky and drowned out parts of the movie. It reminded me of when you see a singer who is not really confident and they just let their band run all over them and their singing is drowning in it. The quality of tje music wasn't very good either. It lacked instrumentation and sounded like a music producer friend of mine sitting in front of his computer and testing beats in an obnoxious way, not something that would make it to a movie
Some one needed to ride rough shod over this music department because the music should add to the action, accentuate and support the scene, This movie could be several points better if the music were redone."
" jackson excels
",0.5423,0.3641,2020-07-11 00:00:00,7,I thought this was a well put together thriller. I am not a professional film critic who gets paid mega bucks to criticise films. this was very well done and samuel jackson shines.
" Doubtful Reason...
",-0.34,-0.8916,2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"The problem with this run-of-the-mill crime thriller is that is based on a rather thin story that, despite a decent effort from Samuel L. Jackson, never remotely catches fire. Dominic Cooper is an aspiring lawyer who is involved in an hit and run from which he - after calling for an ambulance - does a runner. The victim later turns up dead - murdered, and soon it all becomes a little more complex as Jackson is firstly arrested for the crime then, thanks to Cooper, acquitted. Cooper becomes wary of Jackson and soon they are involved in quite a taut little cat and mouse caper with both trying to expose the other and keep their own secrets intact. Jackson delivers quite well as the cleverly manipulative, menacing, ""Clinton Davis"" but Cooper is just, as usual, a good looking supporting actor who really struggles to display anything much with his, admittedly, weakly written character. Kills an hour and a half, but nothing much more than that."
" I felt a bit cheated
",-0.5106,-0.9044,2020-05-05 00:00:00,5,"I was actually rooting for Samuel L. Jackson's character and then near the end, he suddenly goes ""evil"" for no reason either to make Dominic Cooper's character more likeable. I didn't think that Samuel L. Jackson's character was a serial killer than he was a vigilante killer. I empathised with him when he went against criminals who got away from the system due to technicalities."
" Interesting Movie
",0.4019,0.9505,2020-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Just when the main character seems to have things going for himself, he is thrown into a interesting predicament..........Definitely a great adventure, and has some interesting moves but probably could have had some better twists and turns in order to make an even better movie..But for a movie to watch on a quiet weekend, I would still recommend this movie that has some star power....."
" Solid Film
",0.1531,-0.408,2019-11-11 00:00:00,7,Very good story with a cool twist. The only thing that didn't sit well was the ending. I didn't like that the serial killer turned into what he was against. I felt it could of went another way 6.7 ‚≠ê's for me
" Run of the mill
",0.0,0.0178,2019-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Ok for a watch but nothing thrilling, just an ok cop/lawyer type caper."
" Not Believable Storyline - Poor Acting - Glad It's Over - Skip .. Skip .. Skip To The End
",0.6761,0.0,2019-04-04 00:00:00,5,04/04/2019 Not much of a movie. Not even close to being realistic plus crummy acting by many. Bon Appetit
" Let's not go too far with the criticism, this one is not bad at all
",-0.0129,0.9357,2019-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Let's say that you're a normal TV watcher and you do 5-6 thrillers a year, or a film-buff and do 15-20. Let's face it, most of us get to know films and film genres ... and become a good judge of them, by watching a fair number. In so doing, we're going to come across a mix of unwatchable, fairly watchable, good and - just occasionally - superb movies. Despite the quite (I'd say surprisingly) strong criticism among these reviews here, ""Reasonable Doubt"" from Peters Howitt and Dowling is certainly up to watchable, and I reckon verging on the ""good"". Maybe it's not extremely original, but it's got lots of twists and turns that keep you going, and it has those dark, dingy, winter-in-Chicago vibes that offer a nice-enough background and atmosphere for a movie that starts off with a ruffian-turned-good guy wracked by guilt for one stupid thing he's done and ends up ... well, very far from that. The story builds and builds and certainly at odd moments it's a touch implausible - as may be the accent of star Dominic Cooper as lawyer Mitch Brockden. But plenty of times it's intriguing and worthy of the name and genre ""thriller"". And Samuel L. Jackson gives good value as usual. Most other players except Ryan Robbins as Jimmy Logan don't do much, but - no matter what those fussy reviewers say - you could find plenty of worse films to fill 90 minutes than this, and many that had bigger money and ridiculous amounts of sell put into them. ""Reasonable Doubt' was turned out for $8M and doesn't pretend to be more than it is ... which is quite good, pretty unpredictable and nicely atmospheric. Job well enough done, I'd say."
" But the second half is just another story, completely out of touch with the front mattress
",0.0,-0.0891,2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"The first half is good. The lawyer's drunk driving collided with people, and his tense performance before and after people, and a little feeling. But the second half is just another story, completely out of touch with the front mattress."
" I SEE YOU WERE HAVING A CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE
",-0.6249,-0.9727,2018-10-14 00:00:00,8,"Mitch Brockden (Dominic Cooper) is from South Chicago with a checkered past and criminal step-brother. He has been able to hide much of this as he is a family man climbing the ladder as a city prosecutor. He doesn't lose cases. After a night out with the boys he drives intoxicated and hits another man. He calls 911 then flees the scene. Clinton Davies (Samuel L. Jackson) is arrested for the murder after police find the bloody body in his vehicle. Clinton claimed he found him in the road. Mitch must prosecute Clinton for a crime that he himself committed.Now that could make a good movie in itself, except it gets really twisty. There are decent clues dropped along the way for the twists, so they don't come too unexpected...except maybe that one thing. The courtroom drama is over after 30 minutes and the rest of the film becomes a crime drama with Samuel L. Jackson in a fitting role.Parental Guide: Infrequent F-bomb (One I recall). No sex or nudity."
" Silly and completely forgettable
",0.0258,-0.6218,2018-10-06 00:00:00,4,"'Reasonable Doubt' more closely resembles a bloated episode of a TV police drama than a movie. From the very start, it gives off the impression of a low-budget production put together with minimal effort and serving only as a quick pay day for everybody involved. Despite having what it probably thought would be a gripping storyline, 'Reasonable Doubt' manages to be a generic and completely forgettable thriller, lacking any real distinctive features to separate it from every other crime drama out there.The problems in this movie actually all stem from the mess of a plot. A storyline as unrealistic and plain silly as this one should never have been given the green light for a movie. No matter how good the writing or the acting may be, the storyline is what makes or breaks any film. A storyline that is so far-fetched that it's completely unbelievable, especially in the case of a crime thriller, won't have viewers gripped but will instead have them losing interest and switching off."
" Boring TV Movie
",-0.3182,-0.8652,2018-09-04 00:00:00,1,"This is so stupid. I've seen more interesting episodes of Law and Order. The dialogue doesn't sound like things people would actually say. The bad guy is just a ""bad guy"" an unbelievable one at that."
" Too bland to succeed
",0.4939,-0.9682,2018-07-21 00:00:00,4,"Although the core premise of ""Reasonable Doubt"" has been done in various ways over the years, it still could have worked with enough good writing that threw in some well executed twists. However, the story as it is does not manage to engage the viewer that much. In a movie like this, you really need to feel the screws slowly tightening on the main character. But for over two-thirds of the movie, the main character does not seem to be under a lot of pressure, almost treating his situation as it was a minor inconvenience. Even when things eventually start to turn bad for the character, actor Dominic Cooper is so underwhelming that you don't care one way or another. The script is quite bad at times, having some plot twists that are kind of hard to swallow, and also having a story that's so thin that there are over 10 minutes of closing credits to try and pad out the movie to a normal running time. The ending of the movie, where it's very unclear of the eventual fate of Cooper's character, is the icing on the cake. The movie has professional production values, so at least it's nice to look at, at least if you are not driven asleep by the slow and passionless story. It's no surprise that Telefilm Canada (the nation's main feature film funding agency) backed this film, since they have traditionally made poor choices as to film projects to fund."
" Should be called Suspension of Disbelief
",0.0,0.7346,2018-06-03 00:00:00,4,"The Hitchcockian plot is kind of perfect for a fun-little-detective-movie, but this film just does not get it right. The dialogue, the police work, the court room scenes...are all totally unbelievable. If you can suspend your disbelief enough you might enjoy the ride. I couldn't get past it."
" Avoid it
",-0.296,-0.3632,2018-05-30 00:00:00,5,"There is a reasonable doubt that Samuel L Jackson was back on some rent or mortgage payment because there is no reason he'd be apart of this abomination if not to pay someone off. The plot is predictable, and you know how it will end in the first minute of the film. Its not even good escapist fun. (Avoid it)"
" Even better the second time around
",0.4404,0.872,2018-05-21 00:00:00,9,"I liked this movie and there is some things that you won't catch until you watch it again.
It's unfortunate when movies like the shape of water do better than one that's exciting like this one."
" A hidden gem!
",0.0,0.4588,2018-05-07 00:00:00,8,"A film I've passed over many times and yet, it yicks so many boxes for me. One of those escalating stories with list of layers, glad I finally checked it out."
" less than thriller
",0.0314,-0.8874,2017-08-20 00:00:00,5,"Mitch Brockden (Dominic Cooper) hopes to get a promotion at the DA office in Chicago. He's on his way home after a night celebrating with his buddies when he hits a pedestrian. Fearing a DUI, he leaves the scene of the crime. Next morning, Clinton Davis (Samuel L. Jackson) is found with the body and arrested. Det. Blake Kanon (Gloria Reuben) is the investigator. Mitch volunteers to take the case.This is set up for a Hitchcockian thriller even if it's somewhat derivative. The not guilty verdict midway through the movie hits with a thud. The tension is drained. Some of the dialog is tiresome and frustrating. The business card seems to be an ace in the hole that Clinton would play a lot sooner during the trial. There are lots of little inconsistencies which add up to a less than stellar thriller. The big setup is full of conveniences. This should be Hitchcockian but there are always nagging annoyances."
" An upsetting motion picture.
",-0.4767,-0.9375,2017-06-18 00:00:00,1,"This is another one of those rare thrillers that slipped through the cracks, and for good reason, the plot is horrible and too upsetting, to base a movie plot off of someone leaving another person to die alone in the middle of the street is vile, it's an awful basis for a story line, the writers, director, actors e.c.t must have lost their minds to want to make and participate in a movie that is so inhumane, regardless if the guy left for dead is a bad guy it's just more and more evil piling on top of each other and it doesn't stop, this is not a decent thriller, the dreadful plot outweighs any good acting this flick has, thrillers can be dark - but not this dark because they just become non-enjoyable, i recommend another film that has a similar title but has a completely different plot ""Beyond A Reasonable Doubt"" remake."
" Unlikable characters, preposterous plot and a director who used a pseudonym
",0.0,0.9344,2017-04-27 00:00:00,1,"The three main characters are a serial murderer, a corrupt DA and the DA's paroled unofficial step brother who's also become a perjurer to help the corrupt DA in his pursuit for ""justice."" What's not to like?Pretty much everything. The plot is preposterous with the DA embarking essentially on a life of crime. Of course the courtroom scenes take place only moments after the crime occurs. Basically, you get arrested and the next day you are in court, before a jury, being tried for that crime. Yeah. That's how it always happens. (The baby in the film, played by a lifeless doll, never ages.) Setting aside the courtroom scenes, the DA goes from drunk driving and felony hit and run to breaking and entering on at least two occasions. One of them being the least guarded police facility in the known universe. Yeah, believable. And what was the DA going to do with the evidence he illegally uncovered at the serial murderer's place? But there was a full time cinematographer so that must be good, right? Nope. The film was shot in bleak Winnipeg, which is supposed to be a stand in for Chicago. That doesn't work either.Two reasons why you won't want to waste your time. First, I read that the film sat in the can for 2 years while the producers tried to figure out how to release it. Was it released so that the investors wouldn't sue them? I don't know. Second, the director was so proud of this film that he made sure his name wasn't used in the 11 minute credit roll. Well, at least the director wasn't Alan Smithee and the star of the film George Spelvin."
" Disappointing!
",-0.5411,0.0276,2017-04-05 00:00:00,1,"In spite of the negative reviews, I decided to buy this movie as I am a great admirer of Samuel L. Jackson. I was deeply disappointed. The scenes are all so dark that you cannot even see his face, the D.A. is unappealing and, all considered, you are not swept in the plot. Yet, the story might have been presented beautifully."
" Better than some reviewers tell you
",0.4404,0.7548,2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"I find a lot of reviewers on here a bit too harsh for this movie. It deserves clearly better then it's actual ratings. Not that it is an excellent movie or so, far from that, but I would watch it again in the future when I forgot about it. There are a ton of movies I watch once and that I will never watch again but this one is not one of them. The story isn't bad, maybe a bit predictable but still with a couple of twists and some suspense. Dominic Cooper and Samuel L. Jackson made this movie enjoyable to watch. The filming was also okay, nothing wrong to say about that. Believe me there are way worse crime thrillers than this one. So I really don't get what the problem is if you like this genre of movies because it totally fits this genre."
" Standard Thriller
",0.1027,-0.938,2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"Reasonable Doubt (2014) is a typical limited released date crime thriller which appear for several weeks then quickly become forgotten. This film had a very similar premise of what one would find in crime drama television series such as CSI or Law and Order. The tone of the film does not necessary feel that of a film, mainly due to the soap opera-esque acting. The film is a decent watch though predictable and not as thrilling as one would expect. The characters play it standard and there isn't much character development throughout. They could have done more with Samuel L. Jackson's character, in which he came off as dull and plain for what the character's traits were. Reasonable Doubt isn't is a rather quick film, which stalls at certain parts, but other then that, this is one of those one-time watch crime thrillers. As in, there aren't any unsolved clues or things in which you need more viewings to spot if you have missed something on your initial viewing."
" Lazy, full of holes, and unbelievable
",-0.1779,-0.9888,2017-01-20 00:00:00,3,"Hmmm... I know it's only 81 Min's long, but it's really hard to keep your brain turned off for all that time when something this trite and just plain lazy is offered up. I shan't review the plot (such as it is-I got the impression it was scribbled down on a cigarette packet after a night of heavy drinking, and never redrafted afterwards), because it's already been exhaustively picked apart elsewhere.What really struck me about this offering was the total lack of engagement and empathy for any of the characters. Mitch Brockden (Dominic Cooper) is characterless and colourless, a devoted family man who thinks nothing of jeopardizing that family's future and well-being by his rash actions, a career attorney and putative politician who risks all by such awful courtroom etiquette that he exposes himself to possible disbarment, and then gambles it all yet again with illegal, unauthorized independent action. Samuel L. Jackson (Clinton Davis) just wires in his performance by the numbers-he seems to have lost his quality control radar, and is now appearing in any old rubbish. The only other cast member worth mentioning is Gloria Reuben, as the leading Homicide Detective, but even her performance is nothing better than you'd see on any 60 minute detective show on network TV, and many of those are far better... The film is full of superfluous and overused clich√©s (how many more times are we going to see a protagonist try and use a cellphone that has no signal), and riddled with inconsistencies and 'plot holes' (see elsewhere). There also appear to be key scenes that have been either edited out, or deleted, leaving the viewer bemused. All in all a classic illustration of how not to make a movie. Either pare the plot down slightly and use it in an hour-long TV show, or rewrite the whole thing THINKING about the plot, and making it at least remotely believable. Lazy, inconsistent, ill thought-out, badly cast, and completely unbelievable."
