" Pure piece of nepotism.
",0.0,-0.25,2019-11-30 00:00:00,1,"I just watched the end of the movie, towards the end when Salman was running away from 4-5 dozens of cops with rifles in their hands, they had a good 2 min window before children showed up and no one decided to shoot a single bullet.If Salman was not in the movie it would be a big flop.
Now a days movies don't need a script they just need a well renowned actor face."
" Tedious star vehicle is a chore to sit through
",0.0,-0.4588,2019-10-31 00:00:00,2,Rating2/10Extremely tedious film is a chore to sit through. The story is poor and it's basically a star vehicle for an uninterested Khan. The stunts and fight scenes are dull. Good actors like Nawaz and Hooda are wasted.Avoid
" BPD
",0.0,0.8845,2019-07-05 00:00:00,7,"It's Salman Khan, so the entertainment value is through the roof. On the other hand, nothing makes sense. It seems like this movie is about a guy who just lives for thrills. The main character seems to have severe BPD."

" Irritating first half and boring second half
",-0.6486,0.5927,2018-12-18 00:00:00,1,"Kick is a remake of Telugu movie Kick. While the original kick had kickass comedy, this version forces you too kick the ass of the director. First half is irritating where Salman tries hard to imitate Ravi Teja's mannerisms but Ravi Teja's style is unmatchable. Second half is boring trying to show different from original mixture of dhoom and previous salman films. Please watch the original kick."
" A decent movie inspired from Salman's Charity work!
",0.7424,0.9814,2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,"Am I Salman Khan fan? If you ask me this question today I would say I am neutral. What I definitely cherish is the charity work he does, that is the reason why one appreciates this movie.While watching for the first time I got what you call kick in this movie throughout when movie ran on big screen. After watching on my computer it was not the same experience. Despite that it is a decent movie and you cannot take that away from it. What I would like to highlight is even if the experience was not liked the first time my emotions still flew. I mean my eyes were wet when the girl who was ill emerged.It is not like most of the Salman Khan movies, thus being underrated cause me discomfort. As a fan and as a human being one should appreciate his work as charity. A movie inspired from that is something that I appreciate.Salman looked great throughout the movie. A tip I would like to give him. It is he looked better with a 'non'clean-shaved look.Tone, Script & Story: See IMDb Storyline.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified and were Eye candy. Music: Good. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: It is a decent movie. If you love Salman's work, you will love it even more. All I wanted was to feel kick like the first time I watched it but that's OK."
" Outstanding
",0.6124,0.8176,2018-08-05 00:00:00,9,A superb entairtining script.. A must watch Salman look fabulous
" So, what's the plot here??
",0.0,-0.0903,2018-07-01 00:00:00,2,"Not as exciting as I had hoped it would be. The visuals are amazing, but the story is too slapstick and overall not interesting enough. The plot is downright silly: about a man who doesn't really get a 'kick' out of anything...I didn't get a kick out of the film, either..."
" Thoroughly Enjoyable
",0.4927,0.9391,2017-07-27 00:00:00,8,"Devi (Salman Khan) is an adrenaline junkie and does every thing he can to get a kick. After breaking up with his girlfriend (Jacqueline Fernandez), he becomes a daring thief known as ""Devil"" who risks it all on high profile escapades. Randeep Hooda plays the police officer who has made it his personal goal to catch Devil.There are times when this action packed film is a bit confusing (keeping up with locations, for instance) but that doesn't detract from the fun. Khan is wonderful in his role, as is Hooda. Though Fernandez is not as strong an actor as the other two, she acts naturally and believably. The songs (with the exception of ""Hangover"") and choreography are average, but the filmography is grand. Overall, this thriller will keep the viewer thoroughly entertained."
" Below Average film of Salman Khan
",0.0,0.9989,2017-06-07 00:00:00,6,"Salman Khan was a typical action hero, who has many fans following across the world. Now he is doing typical masala entertainer film that we have seen so many times. He wants to entertain us to enjoy with family, kids and friends. Salman is doing another commercial entertainer film, which was a remake of Ravi Teja's earlier film Kick. When i watched Kick, it didn't fulfilled my expectations, I was disappointed, I have a lot of expectations to the movie, specially the story is not good, I was expecting something else, because even through i was expecting a much more crisper story line, a much more captivating and fascinating story line. But it wasn't there in the film. Normally i was expecting a proper action thriller film like only a serious action film with realistic stunts. But now it was a typical action film which has over the top action stunts when people was flying, there was no gravity and realism. First of all, the first half was OK-sh, it has great funny moments, Salman was good but sometimes, he was overacting in some scenes, that overact scenes was similar to Ravi Teja in Kick. But Salman Khan was playing almost like a thief who wants to steal the money. The character was well-design but there are some portions of the film, he is a thief, of course, that it has to be someone like ruthless, someone is very smart and fearless that he can do anything to do his own stuff like if they faced someone, they was able to kill him at the middle of the film, but in this film, there was showing that his sides. You felt almost believable, which means you felt like OK he is not a proper thief, he is like a genuine person that he helps the children to save the kid in which his parents commit suicide. So they could have done a bit better characterization of Salman Khan. And Jacqueline Fernandez's characterization was good, again they could have done a bit better writing and characterization of Jacqueline Fernandez's portion. The rest of the actors like Randeep Hooda, he was amazing, his acting as a cop was very good and he did a good job. Nawazuddin Siddiqui also was amazing and brilliant in this film. His villain character was excellent and as a negative role, the way he deliver his dialogue, it was good. The positive parts of the film is the performances. Salman Khan was very good, as I said there are some scenes, he overacts but the rest of the scenes, he did a good job in Kick, especially his fights, facial expressions and dance was excellent. There was also when he was funny and angry. He can performed as well. Salman is good performer and entertainer, we all know that. He is also a singer. For the second time, she is singing a song in Kick after Hello Brother (1999). For his character portrayal is that Salman is not actually a bad person, he is actually someone, that helps children to celebrate the Children's day, he is also a happy go lucky guy that he is looking for adventure, thrill, fun and kick. He is not a villain actually. In the film, there were showing that, Salman Khan is playing that Devil is actually a good person. Jacqueline Fernandez did a decent job, she doesn't really improved her acting in this film. She a bit overacting but even through, she has an important role in this film. Her acting was average. She has the same facial expression in Housefull 2 and she doesn't pulled off her acting. But hopefully she can prove her acting and get a better performance from her in the future. Nargis Fakhri as the item girl, we have seen her as a dancer, she is good. As well as that, Randeep Hooda, the right person in this film without being too over-exaggerated to play a police officer, he did a excellent job. I like the fact they chose a better actor to play a cop. That's why I loved his acting, Randeep Hooda is almost overshadowed Salman Khan. But this film is all about Megastar Salman Khan, anyway but Randeep Hooda is playing a pivotal role to face Salman Khan. And Nawazuddin Siddiqui is good, his acting as a negative role is excellent. The only person in this film without being established themselves and over-exaggerated to play a villain. But even through, he is the antagonist in this film, Nawazuddin did a great job. He is one of the most underrated actor in Bollywood film industry that he can do any roles. As an actor, he proved himself and his acting is always good. After the positive parts, so now, lets talk about the negative parts Of This film. Mostly why I didn't like about the film is the writing and the screenplay, that was a big letdown. To was the climax scene, Salman Khan is now become a genuine person and the police officer without telling the true identity. That's why the director didn't well is the writing and the screenplay of the film. So Sajid Nadiadwala should do only a producer and distribution of the film. The story could have been a lot better, but again, the plot was the same typical story that the villain confronted the hero and the hero fights the villain. So the story should have done a lot better. The action sequences is good, again it could have been done better on the action sequences. It was realistic and over the top at the same time, but it was bit cheesy. So the action choreographer could have been made a better action stunts in this film. The songs are very good, it was very well placed especially Jumme Ki Raat, Yaar Na Miley and Hangover. Hangover was sung by Salman, he sings very well. He proves himself as a singer. Yo Yo raps the song Yaar Na Miley. His rap is also good. Jumme Ki Raat made everyone dancing in every parties. Of course, all the songs of the film became popular. Overall, Kick is a below average movie with typical clichÃ©d story and decent acting performances. Only Nawazuddin, Salman and Randeep was excellent. But that's all, they was nothing else, nothing new and special. You guys can watch this film without any expectations. But in my opinion, it's a one time watch movie. If you a big Salman Khan fan, you can watch this movie. If you want this kind of movie, just watch it, if you love it."
