" C'mon this is surely not a 5.5*
",0.4404,0.9407,2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Synchronicity is a time-travel done almost right. It's a similar in concept to ""
Primer"" with a more mature and clear storytelling. IMO, it would be 10/10 if the ending would have been slightly different (less optimistic, i know right?).A better ending would have been if Jim, after discovering he's already checked-in, would enter the room of his other self, then would see several bodies of his other-selves realizing he can't change anything, and then movie would end. That IMO would have been slightly more ""realistic"".But anyway, apart from this ""improvement"" this movie is very good. Highly recommended!"
" Dull muddled retro 80s-ish Blade Runner tribute
",-0.4019,-0.8085,2021-02-09 00:00:00,4,"The theme music is just way too on the nose evoking Blade Runner. You don't even have to look at the screen and you'll pick that up. Additionally, the rather casual pacing is certainly reflective of a lot of 1980's sci-fi.Too much of the movie is seriously muddled. First of all, the inventor is extremely obsessed with inventing, then sees a hot lady, then just starts chasing her. Wtf?The time machine- it's really not established well visually, so it's hard to tell where someone is supposed to go through it or whatever. And really bad is that much of it is constructed of obvious movie set lighting instruments. Bleh.The movie really gets confused when it's decided he's not time traveling, he's switching between realities. Maybe I just didn't get it. Though, there are some eerie powerful scenes when they switch to the alternate reality concept."

Have a female pro-wrestler as his love interest. I saw another flick with this theme, where the hero shoots the other versions of himself. Maybe that movie should have shot this one."
" This movie is all Flowers and Wormholes...
",0.0,0.9871,2020-09-17 00:00:00,4,"I watched ""Synchronicity"" last night with my brother on Blu-Ray. It was alright. There were things I liked about it and things I didn't. It was one of those indie sci-fi films which starts off well and makes good use of a small budget, then takes a very dumb turn halfway through which it never recovers from -- and then can't figure out where to end.The thing I enjoyed most about the movie was its flagrant overuse of the word ""wormhole."" There are some scientists, and they're working very hard to open a wormhole. This wormhole requires a great amount of energy to open, and they alone know the secret to harnessing that energy, and opening that wormhole. It is a fussy wormhole. They soon learn their wormhole it has two ends -- a receiving end and a transmitting end. So they spend a lot of time discussing their wormhole, peering into their wormhole, contemplating their wormhole.Then, one of the scientists meets a woman who is in possession of a rare and exotic flower. He asks to see her flower, and she laughs and says, ""Do we really know each other that well yet?"" But she shows him anyway. And then, later, her flower comes through his wormhole. This struck me then -- as it does now -- as a mind-blowing feat of physical gymnastics, as well as a very funny sentence.Anyway, this movie is all flowers and wormholes and half-unwitting double-entendres, and up until a certain point it's all the better for it. I laughed until I tired of laughing, and then suddenly the film became an unsuccessful relationship-drama -- an odd mixture of somber and juvenile -- at which point I grew rather tired of watching it.""Synchronicity"" is not an utter waste of time, due to its fun first half and some rather well-realized ""Blade Runner on a Budget"" visuals. During that first half, the film is deliberately campy at times, and unintentionally funny at other times, and although the writing is juvenile and the plot-logic is a little fuzzy, I really didn't mind.It's unfortunate that the film turns ""serious"" halfway through, because the characters aren't well-realized enough to pull-off a serious relationship drama, and the film has nothing but shopworn cliches to offer in that regard. The juvenile quality in the writing is fun when the film isn't taking itself too seriously. When it starts taking itself seriously, that same juvenile quality undercuts its efforts.The first half of the film is a doofy but fun (and visually pleasing) film about time-travel, with a bit of noirish intrigue. The latter half of the film reminded me of a drunk ""bro"" at a bar regaling me, for far too long, about a girl he'd lost -- all the while revealing himself to be a tiresome a**hole who thinks himself some kind of saint, and describing his girl in such an idealized way that it seems impossible that he ever really knew her as well as he thought he did. It grows quite tiresome."

",0.6249,0.9634,2019-03-22 00:00:00,7,"This is a very watchable time-travel movie, with strong atmosphere and a small, competent cast. The cast and crew have done a marvelous job stretching a small budget into a very good looking and compelling tale. While not as good as ""Primer"", Synchronicity carries itself well. With the help of a remarkably good retro-synth score, and generous amounts of haze, ""Synchronicty"" feels quite immersive. It keeps things relatively uncomplicated and lets the viewer enjoy the experience. The story moves at a slow, but steady pace. If you're looking to time-travel 101 minutes into the future, watching Synchronicity is a good way to get yourself there."

More and more, the science fiction viewpoint gradually presents itself in a complete way, intertwined with multiple time lines, and it is not clear which one is accepted at all. The whole theory is still acceptable after reading, but the scriptwriter is too bad. Also, the pictures are too dark and the scenery is too low-grade."
" A Bold Attempt To Go Beyond
",0.3818,0.9229,2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"10 June 2016. The particular difficulty of time travel movies is how such movies address the time travel paradox. Oftentimes, the paradox is either just brushed over so the action part of the movie can be on full display like The Terminator (1984) or Timeline (2003) or there is a simple effort to explain it away or to simply demonstrate its odd effects like in Time Cop (1994) or The Philadelphia Experiment (1984).What Synchronicity brings to the big screen is a brilliant use of quality looking visual set design and a sound track that readily borrows from Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982). In addition the script has attempted to delve more deeply into the twisting confusing nature of time displacement and eerie time contradictions resulting of moving back in time than movie time travel movies even more so than the elegantly presented The Thirteenth Floor (1999). The Thirteenth Floor had a more focused and coherent script outline of distinctive time periods thus less challenging than more confusing, shorter contemporary loopy time jumps like found in Synchronicity.The weak part of the movie that likely prevented this movie from becoming a classic is the like of chemistry between the two leads and the various endings which seemed to come off a little too confusing. But overall this sci fi thriller results in a bold effort to delve into the possible convolutions of time travel with amazing low-budget sights and sounds along with an interesting and possibly haunting ending."

A scientist invents a time/multi-verse travel machine and uses it primarily to ""work on his relationship"" with a young woman. And I still can't figure out who had the dahlia and when they had it or why the dahlia even mattered in the first place.

",0.0,0.9078,2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"I don't often write reviews and I'm making an exception this time because I almost never watched this film due to its 5.5 rating. Normally IMDb ratings are a good indicator of a films worthiness but this is a notable exception. Reading the reviews I noticed they were very polarised. Either really bad or really good. Seemed like a ""love it or hate it"" type. I decide to give it 10 minutes just to get a feel for it. If you are reading this and trying to decide I suggest you do the same. It's more of a romance than a sci-fi, has elements of Blade Runner and is very atmospheric. Sound track is awesome. I've given it a 9/10 just to re-balance the very unfair 5.5 rating. If I was to rate with an IMDb average rating then I'd give it a 7.9"
" By and far the worst movie I've seen
",-0.6249,-0.9841,2017-10-03 00:00:00,1,"This movie sounds like it has potential. Don't be deceived, any potential it actually had on paper was tragically destroyed by the weak plot, horrible acting, and the overly dramatic cinematography. The first hour of the movie was a collage of me thinking ""wtf!?"" and cringing at the awkward acting.By the middle of the movie, I would have decidedly rather be spending my evening in a fist fight with an angry bear, or at least a bear cub, while listening to a song by Paris Hilton, on a malfunctioning CD player with earbuds that are far too big for my ears. The story was written around very few plot points, that are simple, unimaginative, and not intellectually stimulating. Not to mention the physics are complete BS in this movie. I understand it's science fiction but they could have at least tried.The only reason this movie is getting a 1/10 rating from me is because 0 is not a valid option. When I say it's the worst movie I've ever seen, I've seen some pretty bad movies. The worst one before this one was the One Warrior. Man, that was bad.Don't waste your time with this. The ending sucks. The beginning sucks. And everything in between sucks."

Your need to like sci fi thematic before liking this movie."
" Time is our only real currency.
",0.0,0.9903,2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"I stumbled across this movie on Netflix and it was very good. The story was a little far fetched, but overall I do not regret spending my time to watch it. The physics talk throughout the movie was enjoyable. Also, the 3 scientist were very passionate about their experiment and successful creating a worm hole. Two great movie quotes that I saved in my memory bank:""Time is our only real currency"" and ""Time is the greatest teacher that eventually kills all of it's students.""The ending was good. It explains a lot of the behavior that the lady portrayed throughout the movie."
" Excellent plot almost ruined by awful acting
",-0.2128,0.9183,2017-07-28 00:00:00,8,"Let's start the review backwards: the acting is, indeed, awful - I mean, there's not a single decent actor in the whole film, and this sure makes the film a lot harder to connect to.On the other hand, the plot is really fresh and well worth the troubles - even if at some points you may get a bit too puzzled about what's really going on.Bottom line: if you like sci-fi, watch it. And be nice to it - it will reward you for that."
" Great and lame at the same time, it barely missed the sweet spot
",0.4818,0.9925,2017-07-13 00:00:00,8,"The film has everything you could want: a 1980's soundtrack, a noir look a la Blade Runner, a scientist mad with the possibilities of his time travel machine and a beautiful girl to make it all worthwhile. Add to this Michael Ironside, who just lends gravitas to the entire thing and the only thing you could be missing is a smart script. And you are not, because this movie is smart.So why didn't it become an instant classic? Because in the end, it was one hour and forty minutes for a punchline. The possibilities were infinite, pardon the pun, but the movie did not capitalize on them. That is why many of the people are either disappointed with the result or frustrated for not getting the complicated mechanics of time travel.For me, it was a stylistically beautiful movie, with a lot of love poured into it. The acting was good, the story interesting. Most stories are usually broken by the addition of time travel or are based on it so much that they ignore anything else that might matter. Synchronicity did not fall into the first category and came very close to slip from the second and into the one of great films. I am sure that if it would have been done in the 80s, the time it seemed to belong to - pardon the pun again, it would have had a great success.Bottom line: clearly better than average, but not consistently so. It has great moments and silly underdeveloped ones, it has a story with a lot of potential, but only a bit of it capitalized into anything. Certainly worth a watch."
" Failed Homage to The Blade Runner
",-0.5106,0.9909,2017-06-16 00:00:00,4,"Not much to say about this movie. The story line was weak. The acting mediocre. But the most maddening thing was the very obvious attempt to reproduce the look and feel of The Blade Runner. In that, it only partially succeeds by making it clear which shots were being replicated (har har).Deckard's apartment is the most obvious source for the apartments of both the main character and his romantic interest: The light streaming in through blinds of vehicles flying by as an example. The scenes where elevators are moving up and down the external side of a building very much like the Tyrellcorp building elevators is another.At one point there is a scene where the female love interest is asleep and the physicist is on the left side of the frame backlit. Very very reminiscent of the ""do you trust me"" scene in The Blade Runner. The apartment intercom is very very much like the scene where Deckard calls Rachel from the bar. Combine all of this with the use of Vangelis-like sounds that never quite go to the right places, and you have the makings of a film that elicits some amount of grief and a yearning for someone to do things right. This is not that film.If you've never seen The Blade Runner, you need to see it and decide who does this better. Stories are completely different, but the attempt of look and feel is very obvious and ham fisted. If you haven't seen this movie, just go in expecting the quality of a 1990's SciFi original and you will not be disappointed."
" ""Synchronicity""- Lofty ideas and an intriguing premise betrayed by some of the dullest pacing and bizarre aimlessness I've ever witnessed. A monotonous experience.
",-0.8402,-0.9567,2017-05-15 00:00:00,3,"Time travel has long been a fascinating and wild subject in the world of science fiction. It's a concept that has near limitless potential, and is so undefined in any sort-of ""real world"" manner that it's a creative goldmine. Many films, television series, stories and novels have revolved around this topic. Including many high-profile releases, including the recent gems of ""Looper"", ""Predestination"" and ""Primer."" And you get the feeling while watching writer/director Jacob Gentry's 2015 release ""Synchronicity"" that the film is aiming for the stars and striving to be another classic tale through time. Unfortunately, it misses the mark completely with an aggressively dull and sometimes infuriating sense of pace and a bizarre and distracting aimlessness that is more likely to inspire groans of frustration and dissatisfaction than to inspire the inquisitive thoughts its striving for.It's actually pretty hard to describe the story of the film despite having viewed it within the past week. It's essentially the tale of physicist Jim Beale (Chad McKnigh), who is working on a breakthrough in time-travel. However, his breakthrough is threatened by an opportunistic capitalist who is seeking to gain control over the project (Michael Ironside) and his own conflicted feelings towards a young woman he meets and feels attracted to (Brianne Davis)... but also concerned about because she seems to know too much. As the plot progresses and his life and science begin to collapse around him and fall out of his control, Jim will need to use his discovery of time travel in order to navigate a web of deception and try to put right what is seemingly destined to go wrong.The most striking thing about the film is honestly the fairly strong visual palette and nuanced direction thanks to Gentry's guidance. If nothing else, it's a very well-shot and competently crafted work. The sense of flow in each individual scene, keen use of image composition and intriguing style is usually stirring, and often key sequences are fascinating to behold on an aesthetic level if nothing else. It's a very pretty looking film and the aesthetic is well-utilized to convey the goings on and happenings. There's also the kernel of a good story beneath the surface, and there is a degree of potential as the film develops and elaborates on the characters and situation. The real tragedy is that it took what might have made for a good hour-long television episode and stretched it more than twice the length it needed to be.Yes, unfortunately the film's undoing is frankly a horrendous sense of pacing and a really troubling aimlessness that makes it difficult to watch... and even more difficult to glean any real point out of as a result. I can already hear trembling fingertips on keyboards from people who disagree, but I'm sorry- this is an infuriating and completely monotonous experience. It feels empty and pointless because so much of the story is so drawn out that it loses any impact. And I get the feeling its because not only is Gentry the director, but he's also the editor. And he didn't observe a really important part of what editing entails. That you have to be willing to ""kill your babies"" and cut out anything that isn't necessary for the film to function and excel. Too much time is spent on padding and sub- plots and needlessly prolonged sequences that it comes at the expense of the audience's attention and devotion to the story. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that it needs to move at a lightning fast pace. Deliberation is important. (Observe any of Paul Thomas Anderson's films for prime examples of deliberate but still completely enthralling and engaging works.) But too much deliberation is a very bad thing, and can start to feel like insecurity.Even as the film is drawing to the climax (which I will not spoil), I was gritting my teeth as it meandered on awkward pauses in the dialog... needlessly drawn out establishing shots... Twists and turns that lose any shock value because we've figured them out through visual cues long before the film pauses to very gradually explain them in clunky exposition dumps. I probably counted about a dozen or so scenes that could easily have been chopped in half with clever editing and a vast amount of needless shots and reactions in my viewing of the film, and the more I think about it... the more and more so much of it seems trivial. The fact is, the film feels like an early assembly cut. A rough version that was meant to be cut down more and more until it flowed well and functioned. Only it never went back into editing. There's a pretty decent 80-minute feature here, and a darned good 42-minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode... Only bloated beyond comprehension by padding it out into a 100 minute feature with side-excursions that add little to the proceedings and plenty of needless additions to the story. The focus and pace is simply dreadful and it robs what could have been. Add to that flat and stagnate performances from the bulk of the cast (sans the excellent Ironside), and it's a wholly frustrating work.I'm sure it will have its fans. But I can't help but suggest that you spend your time elsewhere. There's some interesting nuggets of story here and there peppered throughout, but it's a complete chore to slog through and feels superfluous by the time the credits roll. I wish I had a time machine so I could have stopped myself from wasting 100 minutes watching it. ""Synchronicity"" gets a poor 3 out of 10 from me."

That is confusing to me.I think part of the issue of this movie is that it doesn't spoon feed you the plot. You have to think. You have to reflect. You can't go into this movie in a lazy mood, you have to be ready to consider what you are being shown or else you're going to have trouble understanding.The acting was good all around, no academy awards here but at no point was I drawn out of the action due to a jarring performance. The story was where the movie really shines, it's about a time machine and that's all I will say without giving too much away. If you're into complete SCI-FI time machine content you'll love this. It reminded me of Steins Gate in a lot of ways which is a great thing.There are so many twists and turns in this movie that you start to question what you think you 'know' about it.I really had no complaints about this movie at all, it's a bunch of good elements that come together to create a great movie.TL;DR: If you're into SCI-FI movies, I'm absolutely sure you'll enjoy this, just be in the mood to do some thinking."

Don't give up on it. It gets better (and the ""Blade Runner""(1982)-esque soundtrack less noticeably annoying) as the movie progresses and better, still, in hindsight.I've watched the film three times and, after the first viewing, it's easy to see ""Synchronicity"" doesn't treat time travel the way the ""Back to the Future""(1985-'89-'90) franchise, ""Timecop""(1994), ""Timeline""(2003), or most stories in the ""Star Trek"" universe do.Only after my second viewing did I better follow the somewhat confusing last 30 minutes.
