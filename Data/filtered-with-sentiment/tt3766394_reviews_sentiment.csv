" Does Sally ever make a bad movie?!?
",-0.6312,0.9346,2021-04-02 00:00:00,9,"She is still quirky and sweet and relevant. I am 62 and I love a lot of the younger generation stuff and my grandkids think I'm the ""cool"" Nana! That's all that matters to me. I'm still finding me and I think the best is yet to come and this movie agrees!!"
" Great cast, great acting, great editing, great soundtrack
",0.9545,0.9858,2021-03-15 00:00:00,9,"This film reminds you why Sally Fields numbers among the living legends. From her hilariously dour expressions to her masterful muttering, she fully embodies the quirky recluse that is Doris Miller. She holds tension perfectly in every scene without being melodramatic or a caricature.Tyne Daly as her best friend, Roz, is incredible from the beginning. The film casts heavy hitters like Natasha Lyonne and Kumail Nanjiani in bit parts.Greenfield does a good job with the limited material for him. Clearly written for a handsome, vapid man, Greenfield adds real depth and charm to the character.Special attention should go to Doris's wardrobe. Vintage, bright, quirky, and just right, it perfectly cements her in a world of her own, having developed on her own path in life, both stuck in the past and something entirely its own.Occasionally Doris's behavior verges on the uncomfortably creepy. If genders were reversed, this would be a far different movie, though the younger of the pair is at least in their mid-30s (past the age of gross fetishization).While this movie could be a solo vehicle for Fields with little depth outside of that (truthfully, it occasionally is), the stunning ensemble, beautiful art direction, and on point soundtrack make for a lovely movie."
" SALLY FIELD
",0.0,0.9382,2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,"A delightful film,brought laughter, tears. Sally Field is a top performer, always has been no matter the age or persona she portrays she is brilliant. A long enduring career well deserved. Brilliant actress."
" Not as bad as some other reviewers say
",0.431,0.9825,2020-12-05 00:00:00,5,"I think some elements of this movie worked. For one thing, I found Sally Field's character sweet and fairly relatable. It's like she's an combination of a typical 20-30 something female lead in a rom-com, with those vulnerabilities and insecurities, mixed with an older character dealing with a mid-life change. I didn't find her creepy as some other reviewers did, just lost and a bit eccentric. I liked her and Max Greenfield's character's relationship, but I didn't like the unsatisfying ending. It was nice that she ended up cleaning out the house of her hoard, but I would've liked some clarity as to what became of her career and her love life, as those were a pretty big part of the plot, with her journey of self-discovery and everything. Overall, I'd say this movie was okay."
" Oscar for Sally Field
",0.0,0.9585,2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,Love the gentle pace of this sweet woman who gave up her life only to finally find it again! Sally Field really really deserves an Oscar for this performance having charmed this character that could have so easily been disliked on the wrong hands. Doris is a delight and it's bittersweet moments breaks your heart a little. Everyone of the supporting cast really just icing on the cake! This is a must see movie!
" Doris can finally live her life and brings us to this heart-warming journey
",0.0,0.8705,2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"We met Doris on her mother funeral. She is sixty-something woman and for the first time in her life she is alone and independent. This life changing moment give us opportunity to see her closer and go deeper to her unusual mind.Doris for 60 years of her life, put her needs on the second plan. Now when she is finally free, instead of live her life in reality she creates her own imaginary world. Her boring, predictable life changes when John join her company. Handsome, young and full of life man brings some joy to her life. Those two people which at first glance are so different from each other create unique duet. Fortunately, the director doesn't give as simple answer how story will go. At the end the movie leave as will cliffhanger so we can use our imagination and finish the story whatever we like.The Doris' story us realize how hard is leave our comfort zone and change something. During one and half hour we will laugh and cheer Doris but at the end movie will leave us with deeper thought. This unusual picture shows us how relatively normal mother-daughter relationship can influence child's whole life."
" A Perfect Little Movie
",0.5719,0.9822,2020-03-10 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those perfect underrated movies that comes along to warm your soul.
Sally Field doesn't get the reviews she deserves possibly because of Hollywood bias against older women (Her directorial debut of BEAUTIFUL was criticized relentlessly, although it was also a perfect gem, and I hope she directs another.)The writing, directing, set design, costumes, casting and acting are all sublime. Max Greenfield has you at hello, and soon enough we all fall in love with Doris as well. Her outfits were perfectly eccentric and charming."
" A classically great movie
",0.6249,0.8932,2020-02-11 00:00:00,9,It's so warm hearted and good you'll watch it again just to be reminded of how great movies like this used to be.
" Heartwarming and entertaining movie!
",0.7424,0.9324,2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,Great entertainment with a meaningful story. Be your own person and do not let stereotypes keep you from a vibrant life that is well lived!
" Impossible to ""I'm possible""
",0.0,0.9854,2020-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Sally Field is a frumpy, somewhat spacy, office worker with a hoarding problem. Her mother has just died and her life seems very restricted when she meets a young man newly hired at her work and becomes infatuated with him. And life opens up for her in unexpected ways.It's hard not to admire Doris' Quixotic quest for the man of her dreams. We cheer her on and then want to cry out ""don't do it!"" at different points. And Sally Field really inhabits the character. But all the characters in the film are very well played and each provide dimensions to characters that (in lesser hands) could have been stereotypes. Max Greenfield's nice guy really convinces you that he could, maybe, be actually interested in Doris. At least you buy the friendship between them that develops. Tyne Daly is great as Doris' friend who initially supports and then criticizes Doris' actions. Stephen Root displayed an unexpected depth as her brother who you initially think is avaricious (trying to get Doris to sell their mother's home) but you discover in an emotional scene that he's really worried about her.SPOILER ALERT! The movie ends on a very ambiguous note. But I thought it was perfect. As Doris heads out of the office for the last time to an uncertain but different future, we are left uncertain as to what will happen when John catches up to her. But it doesn't matter really. In what matters, Doris is the victor."
" This movie went underrated
",0.0,0.9371,2019-11-07 00:00:00,8,"The strings that this movie tugs on really resonates with anyone who generally does the right thing, are nervous around others, and even more nervous around someone they like. It's quite sad, in a way, to see this movie, because so many are like her, but they their love is neither seen nor heard.
The way the movie constantly depicts how she wants a reality to be, only to be let down with the same scene playing out ""in reality"" is a truth that so many of us know.Sally Field plays the character flawlessly in this piece. Sorry this review is so short, I'm not used to giving reviews but this film will always have a special place in my heart."
" little pity
",-0.228,0.9656,2019-09-05 00:00:00,7,"Doris is lovely and live seriously more than most of us, but if the man she falls love in is the same age as her will be more kindly.
This is the first movie I submit review. Of course I love Doris."
" Hollywood just does not know what to do with women
",0.0,0.923,2019-06-09 00:00:00,7,"Somehow I keep getting older and Sally Field keeps getting younger. lol. She was an adult when I was a little kid watching her in The Flying Nun :). Heaven forbid a 70-something person like herself should have romantic interests... We must call her 60 to be ""acceptable"". She's a consummate actress, and since she's eternally cute-as-a-button, she can pull it off.I will give them full marks for trying to turn the table of routinely having 70- (and almost 80!) year-old actors snagging gorgeous 30-year-olds."
" ""Nobody's perfect.""
",0.0,0.9737,2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"The romance novels prime demographic are the middle aged women for fantasy insert. As the cringe here is 'look don't touch', a cultural etiquette; we trade our youth to allow them their own. Then its violation of the code is unbearable, which is the perfect ingredient for subversive comedy. ""Are we friends or lovers."" It puts out that with human connection there is no difference. By extension it's not love v friendship but reality v. fantasy. Boundaries don't exist here--which is dangerous societally but wonderful cinematically. See how Doris is already this aged Minnie Mouse. In any other film 'Uncle Frank' might be a responsible consolation. Subversion. The film is in love with Sally Field the way she's in love with John. Then its most inspired and self-aware moment, it pulls her from the crowd seeing some iconic Warholian effect in her for an album cover: Sally Field was discovered in both worlds. Peter Gallagher is still quoting the ridiculous affect of his real estate king saying fantasy is reality. He's right, they're in a movie. The 'never ever' game juggles its narrative in layers of truth showing hidden lives outside the norm are everywhere even in fiction. Often films show the consequence of the artless, here, hoarding, as art needs both instigation and sacrifice. ""I'm disappointed in you"" it's as shameful as art's effect is enlightening. See how art achieves the impossible bridging the generations. It's art's fault removing them from comfort as art by its very nature is the same subversion of her loving outside her age bracket. ""Love makes you do crazy things."" Art is craziness itself. Subversion dismounts every norm. The therapists and friends are the broccoli-reality fighting the movie, the movie wins. A deleted scene: ""I became aware of how often I've been performing my femininity."" Yes, once again this is about boundaries and identity; her job is arbitrary and meaningless, she is in this useless post-modern quandary, lost and adorably useless. Lastly, the end is some kind of genius showing how to rewrite an entire picture to save it from itself; my instinct was that it was found in the edit, which sure enough was confirmed in the commentary: ""We had many different versions of it and needed something satisfying, but believable, and surprising."" It happens so quickly and unexpectedly it leaves some great impression even if it doesn't fully account for it, but there reflects the classic screwball comedies; aligning both its feminism and its fantasy. It chose fantasy because cinema is a fantasy, because Sally Field is Doris Day, because nothing is im-possible and aren't movies great. Even those doses of reality it straddles are completely powerless to the magic of movies as the its conclusive subversive force."
" Perfect screenplay and still beautiful Sally Field.
",0.8225,0.999,2019-03-07 00:00:00,8,"Sally Field is an exceptional actress. Not because of being so beautiful and cute though, as actually all actresses are already beautiful and cute. It's because she has never portrayed a cliché; even if the role is a strereotype character she always acts in an original and natural way; an expressive style that's unique to her kind. That's why you never get bored watching her in those films; which become novel like literature works. And this film was not an exception.I don't remember when I last saw a film about a love affair between a young man and an over sixty lady. I think the closest was the ""White Palace"" by dear Susan Sarandon (another of my beloved ones) though, in there, she was just about her fourties, but in this film, Sally Field is about her sixty something! And there's also the film ""Harold and Maude"" from 1971, which is mentioned by Cameron Diaz (another of my beloved girls) in her film ""there's something about Marry"" to be the most romantic love of all times, but honestly I can't agree. I couldn't find much romance in that film. So spanning a fifty years from 70's to this day (2019) the most romantic love affair between a young boy and mature lady remains (imho) to be this very film ""Hello, my name is Doris"" according to my limited exposure to all existing works.The strongest part of the film, other than Sally Field, is its screenplay. Written by Laura Terruso and Michael Showalter (imdb), this scenerio bewilderingly develops the platonically romantic (and therefore potentially funny) relationship between a sixty something, cute and shy office lady Doris (Sally Field) Miller and the new and young guy in the block, John (Max Greenfield). With the help of Sally Field's high grade acting and the perfect flawless support given by the remaining cast the film flows smoothly from the first scene to the last, and drags the audience with it, wondering the result of her platonic romance. The text professionally gives convincing details about the course of events. Things do not just fall in to the ground, as seen in less successful examples. Development is mature. Life is not forgotten too! In addition to presenting the main subject of an ""impossible"" love affair, between the young boy and the old lady, the story also develops important matters about family and friendship, without getting into clichés. The text is thoughtfully written. The comedy is quite abundant too. Especially those ""dream"" moments of Doris yields possibilites for surprising twists and apparently the writers utilized this opportunity with success. The quality of the comedy is comparable to that of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" level, albeit at a quite less number of jokes per minute rate. No No No! Bridget Jones's Diary is full of (funny) cliché; a triumphant example of engineered comedy. Yet there's exactly none in this film. And that's therefore why I think this is a must watch film; for people, for actors & actresses and for writers..."
" So patronizing...
",0.0,0.9215,2018-10-14 00:00:00,5,"If you like non-introspective looks into human life at any age, this is for you. So cliche-filled and superficial. Good acting by the cast, but they didn't have a whole lot to work with. Costume department must not know any actual, creative 65 year olds. Sort of like a high school play, amateurish and lacking much insight. I felt for Sally!"
" An amusing and quirky movie
",0.3818,0.9585,2018-07-09 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed watching this film.Reading the synopsis beforehand I expected it to be kind of a low budget comedy with lots of corny, expected jest of a old lady trying to allure a younger man. Although the movie did have some of these elements, it beautifully dramatized the life of Doris Miller (Sally Field) in a way one can relate to. The age difference between Doris and John Fremont (Max Greenfield, an actor I have been fond of since I saw him as Schmidt in New Girl) is portrayed in a very unique way. In particular the film exploited the almost ridiculousness of modern 'hipster' notions. In several scenes Doris is sketched as a real-life thrift shop and the mere fact that Doris is old attracts and amuses Fremont and his friends.Apart from the main plot that follows Doris' attempts to impress Fremont, it also has some deep character development in Doris. Overcoming her mother's death (Doris took care of her for several years) and having to get rid of some of her mom's belongings, and at the same time handle her demanding siblings, Doris discovers that there is several things in her life that makes her unhappy. While in this turmoil with Fremont it also helps her overcome this personal problems.I would recommend this film to anyone looking for an easy-watching, congenial and relaxing comedy that is not the same as the normal slapstick, predictable comedies doing the rounds nowadays."
" A movie about a frustrated old woman
",-0.5267,-0.1553,2018-02-13 00:00:00,3,"What can I say other then the fact that this movie is about a frustrated old woman who, one day, decides to break up a young couple and then to claim that she never wanted to harm anyone. And for some reason, the gets sympathy and respect for it. All I can say is that this movie is absolutely pathetic and not worth watching."
" Could Doris be the twin sister that Gidget never met?
",0.0,0.9602,2018-01-11 00:00:00,6,"I find that modern films come in four varieties: those which stand the test of time (a rare few), those which appeal to older audiences or the art house crowd, those only meant for young audiences, and those which the various generations can look at in their own way. That last genre is how I see this film, and coming from the late baby boomer era, I find a lot to appreciate here, a lot to make me cringe, and even a lot more to laugh at. I identify with the seemingly sad character played by Sally Field, lost in her world of having taken care of a dying parent. She's also the sole survivor of the veterans in a modernized company (ridiculously) which takes out chairs and puts in oversized beachballs simply ""because"". A new young employee (Max Greenfield) whom she becomes obsessed with, stalks on social media (another big eew), becomes ridiculously trendy, yet comes to life for the very first time. I can't imagine working at an office with nothing but millennials, because as is shown here, the basic rules of language and communication get destroyed. Field though seems to be having a ball and indeed is extremely funny. There's an ironic reference to ""The Glass Menagerie"" which Field appeared in on Broadway at the same time. Field is supported by the wonderful Tyne Daly, earth mother supreme, raising an over the top millennial granddaughter who shows Field how to make a fake social media account and gives her all sorts of ill-advised pointers on getting Greenfield's attention, all the while virtually avoiding her grandmother. So much to amuse, but way more to annoy with it's ultra liberal viewpoints of what society has become. Unlike other modern movies, though, the urge to turn it off is suppressed by the wonderful Fields. Her outburst when an estranged brother and some intrusive social workers try to get the hording Fields to throw things away is truly magical, and as much as you realize how obsessive/compulsive she is, the attempted control is maddening. If this accomplishes anything, it's the thoughts this brings up: of a growing generation gap, of old ideals needlessly replaced by senseless trends. and how just one odd meeting of the minds between different generations can change the world."
" Funny
",0.4404,0.9153,2017-12-30 00:00:00,10,"I was surprised at how cute and funny this movie was. I laughed, I cringed, I laughed again. Watch it."
" Actors try to climb an impossible hill
",0.0,0.9201,2017-11-17 00:00:00,2,"A stunningly bad movie. Not one scene rang true and many made my skin crawl (ball chair scene). There are so many clunkers to pick from but let's choose an early one that kinda sets the overall plot in motion. Fields' nebbish, 65 year old character begins a fantasy crush on a new, young coworker. When she's over at her friend's house who has a 13 year old granddaughter, discussion turns to the fact that Fields is smitten by this new man and said 13 year old granddaughter pulls him up on Facebook. Not one comment is made about his age and stunning good looks. With little discussion of the moral consequences they immediately create a fake Facebook page to begin stalking him. Weird, weird, weird. It's just one after the other. How do you get a green light for script like this?The other part of the movie that felt so off kilter was the wardrobe art direction for Field's character. We have a ""hoarder"" lady living in a run down house that is described by one character as disgusting and yet every day we see a new variation of fresh, kicky, retro outfits with a half up bouffant hairdo and scarf that goes way beyond any grandma's closet. And all the kids on the street think she is just adorable and hip. Give me a break.I see that some people described Sally Fields performance as Oscar worthy which is truly puzzling. To rank in that category the character or performance has to have some connection to reality and touch you with emotional intensity and truth. The only emotion I felt was impatience, as in how much longer before this movie is over."
" Great acting and a subject that might make you uncomfortable
",0.3612,0.9657,2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"This is a romantic comedy in the sense that someone is madly in love with another and they play all these fantasies in their head and it changes their lives. The catch is that the love bird is a 70 year old woman and the object of her infatuation is a twenty something guy that works in her office.Sally Field plays the role great and you can understand that when you watch the movie and you feel weird, when you are both rooting for her and feel a little grossed out. You totally buy her acting in the role.I am not a fan of romcoms and, frankly, I won't recommend this movie, but it had some good moments and it is one romantic comedy that feels real, not those prefabricated guy meets girl, hits a snag and then they get together. If I absolutely had to watch a romcom, this would be in the top of my list."
" It Provides A Pleasant Little Trip
",0.5106,0.8191,2017-09-22 00:00:00,7,"The movie is often humorous, and sometimes sad. The reality is: Doris's life has passed her by, mostly through no fault of her own. She is trying to make up for lost time, or really, lost experiences by stepping out into the world as though she were 30ish. She does not realize that it won't work. It could work fine for her, it's just that it will not work for all of those she encounters.I have a friend who is a little like Doris only that he is male, and he doesn't quite have the courage, or maybe it is naivety of Doris. I'm not sure which. Doris eventually had a rude awakening. My friend has not, probably because he does not ventured out into the world socially as did Doris.As an older guy, I kept flashing back to past Sally Fields roles. It's like a time machine. There's the somewhat more mature Sally Fields seen in Forest Gump, the 30ish mother in both Places In The Heart and also Murphy's Romance, and go way back and there is the teenager in TV's Gidget. Given Sally's work in My Name Is Doris, she's still has some miles on her tires."
" Really?
",0.0,0.8943,2017-08-05 00:00:00,1,"I'm just gonna say: Imagine if it was from a man's perspective. Imagine all the people flipping out over a 60-year-old man trying to pursue a young girl. Not such a comedy genre anymore, aye? Yet somehow this is funny? This shouldn't have been a comedy genre at all. This should have been placed as a thriller but idk, somehow it's quirky and funny when an old woman pursues a hot young man? Why is it funny? Because all women are so harmless? Sure. Plus her stalkerish tendencies to get involved in everything he does is downright creepy. I'm just gonna let you imagine if the genders were switched and see for yourself how terrible of an idea this movie is."
" generation gap
",0.0,-0.5132,2017-06-10 00:00:00,6,"This movie shows that there is a generation gap. Not in years but in understanding this new electronic age and computers. Not everyone is capable with computers, mainly seniors. You cannot exclude us because of our age (me 70 years old), we are are not so easily impressed with Facebook, etc. Sometimes just making a phone call is much appreciated this movie shows this."
" Slow, unfunny
",0.0,-0.539,2017-06-06 00:00:00,4,"The overall 6.7 IMDb rating of this film is terribly misleading. While Sally Field is delightful in parts, the movie is hardly the comedy it is billed as. It is slow, the plot is flimsy, the jokes are uninspired.If this movie is attempting to do what Alexander Payne does with his films, it fails miserably. Eminently skippable, as is evinced by its early availability on Amazon Prime."
" Loved Sally Field - Hated Doris
",-0.0772,-0.994,2017-05-07 00:00:00,3,"I have to start by saying that Sally Field's performance is truly Oscar-worthy. In fact, all of the performances are stellar. The main character, played with perfect pitch by Field, is truly disgusting and frightening. Oddly, the film portrays this lying, manipulative hoarding stalker as a sympathetic character, which she is not. (The following editorial contains spoilers as it summarizes the fate of Doris) Doris should have been punished for being a hoarder and for interfering with her co- worker's personal life. The writers should have shown what happens when destructive, dangerous stalkers bother normal people. I would have given the film a 10 if John had given her a harsh beat down or even murdered her for her transgressions. I think in New York it might be legal to shoot a person who cyber stalks you. Don't take my word for it though as I am not an attorney. I was disbarred years ago and am not at all qualified to give legal advice. For all I know it could be totally illegal to shoot people in NY unless you're a drug dealer or a police officer. Word of advice to the filmmakers: In the real world, John would only be interested in a crazy cat lady lying stalker if he himself were seriously disturbed, so in a sequel it would be good to explore John's dark, perverted, cat lady fetish having, murderous side. Also, I believe it is irresponsible to send such a dangerous message to unbalanced viewers who may feel the film validates their delusions. The Dangerous message is: If you lie, cheat, stalk and steal from your victim, he will love you, even if you're a filthy, smelly unbathed pig who lives in a garbage house. Why? Because you are the center of the universe and others are just props in your play. The more responsible message would be: People like Doris are dangerous and stupid and deserved to be pushed in front of a subway train.Finally, am I alone in my perception that the film strongly implies Doris killed her mother?"
" A little creepy
",0.0,-0.8468,2017-04-23 00:00:00,3,"I found this movie boring with a very creepy main character ""Doris"" played by Sally Field. Also disturbing, in that she helped ruin a relationship because she was stalking her ""love interest"". In fact, the whole stalking plot line is really offensive and I am not sure why people think it's OK?. Can not recommend this movie."
" Very sad drama movie
",-0.5256,0.8751,2017-04-23 00:00:00,1,"I thought this was a comedy. Turned out it was very sad and kept me up all night as I was so upset about this poor old lady being in humiliating situations so many times. I found it to be a heartbreaking movie that made it appear as though love between an older lady and a younger man could not be possible. The old lady was very attaching and I loved her. She played her role beautifully. I just do not see what is funny about this movie, unless you like to laugh at vulnerable old ladies."
" Very endearing film
",0.0,0.9965,2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"Hello my name is Doris (2015) is a sweet, endearing movie about aging in life, love, moving on in life, and ultimately taking control of your life. Sally Field is the perfect choice for the lead role of Doris Miller, she really nails that character and everything about her. Doris Miller is a very shy eccentric woman who has spent the majority of her life taking care of her mother who needed assistance. When her mother passes away, she is left alone. But then a younger very handsome new co-worker (Max Greenfield) comes to her office and she is suddenly smitten with him. She tries to attract him in various ways and that's when our movie really starts. Greenfield and Field have great chemistry together and I loved scenes where they were just talking and getting to know one another. Her character is just so darn adorable that you have to pull for her. And Max is very sweet and kind in this film, even though he doesn't know Doris's true intentions. The script has some humorous moments that work but the majority of the movie focuses on Doris and her journey in this new stage of her life. And that journey is a beautiful one to see. I suggest this movie for any and all, yes it's true that the over 50 crowd may be able to relate to it better, but honestly I think anyone from teenagers to seniors will fall in love with this movie and with Doris! 9/10!"
" Fields is the bravest actress I know
",0.5106,0.8164,2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,"There were so many times in this film I was genuinely sorry for Doris. While there were comical elements, mostly this was a tragic look at a doomed life too many martyr-types of women allow themselves to be locked into. My aunt was one, and she killed herself. Doris, however, has been saved by her great good friend...thank God for that.But along the way, as we see Doris live, love, long, imagine, and absolutely flip out by accepting help from her friend's granddaughter (Facebook can be evil in the wrong hands!); mostly I loved seeing Sally Field as an honest, no-surgery- actress, unafraid to portray a woman who is aged, no longer in her prime, and still willing to face whatever is ahead and live a life anew. Dying young is a tragedy; living a long life as an older person is tough! Here's to ""Hello, My Name is Doris"" for taking a look at a real-life scenario and breathing life into characters who may truly be real folks. Sally Field, I always liked you...and I do even more, now!"
" Loved this film
",0.5994,0.8268,2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Short and simple, I loved it. It needs a sequel if not an HBO or SHO series!So many poignant moments in this film, especially Doris at a mirror later in the film after John rejected here. And joy and craziness. Sally Field displayed an Olympic range of emotions with one of her best-ever performances.Alas, the ending leaves one wishing for more. HBO or SHO could pick up this ball and run with it. What does Doris do for housing, work, dating (hopefully not with ""Uncle Frank."" A decisively happy continuing story line for Doris would be magic."
