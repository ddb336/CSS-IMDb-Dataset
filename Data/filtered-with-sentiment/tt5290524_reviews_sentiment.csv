" So sadly true that is hilarious
",0.399,0.9833,2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"I was zapping TV when I caught this movie starting in a secondary channel and I ended up watching 'till the end. I didn't recognize the actors but I know that European comedies can be quite the surprise and so was this one. Image quality is good with beautiful sceneries, there are the comical songs but above all, being an European myself, I totally got it. It's not full of stereotypes, it's more like reality slightly exaggerated for comical purposes. Or like we say here: ""One has to laugh, so not to cry."""

" Too much sometimes...
",0.0,0.9908,2018-03-21 00:00:00,6,"""Quo vado?"" is an Italian comedy in which we watch a man who is born and raised in a small Italian city, with a guaranteed job in the public sector. After a new government takes control everything in public sector change because it wants to cut down on bureaucracy. As a result, the working conditions of his job will change and also his whole life.I liked this movie because it has an interesting plot but not something extraordinary that will leave you speechless. I believe that it's a good average movie to spend your time and have fun either watching it alone or with company. The only problem or disadvantage of this movie is too much in some scenes and becomes extreme in order to be even funnier but the result is exactly the opposite. It becomes boring and makes you feel that it tries too much for something in order to be funny. I believe that this is a result of the direction which was made by Gennaro Nunziante. In general, I liked the interpretations of Checco Zalone who played Checco and Eleonora Giovanardi who played Valeria.Finally, I have to say that ""Quo vado?"" is a funny comedy with some hilarious scenes but it did not reach its true potential. I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to have a great time watching it but don't have high expectations about the plot."
" Reminiscent of the Fellini/Mastroianni era
",0.0,0.9309,2017-05-30 00:00:00,8,"i saw the Spanish dubbed version of this film with my wife who is a Spanish Civil Servant. The Spanish Civil Service and government structure is similar to that of Italy, so the humor, much of which rests upon the way the system works, is easily understood in Spain. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and I heard my wife on at least a couple of occasions guessing the next bureaucratic maneuver that the recalcitant civil servant would use in his effort to maintain his position. The film effectively uses both Nordic and Latin stereotypes. It brought me back to the days of my youth, when movies such as ""La Dolce Vita"" or ""Bread and Chocolate"" made me laugh out loud, while providing me with an education on the difference between cultures."
" Nice comedy
",0.6486,0.9161,2017-04-20 00:00:00,8,"An Italian film that shows the stereotypes around Italy (and so many parts of the world) and puts them into contrast with the Norway's culture. A simple and fresh comedy that's going to make you laugh out loud. It has some inconsistencies but at the end of the day It let us a good lesson. If you want to relax, watch this movie."
" fresh Italian comedy
",0.5859,0.9987,2017-04-13 00:00:00,7,"The second film we have seen at the Italian film festival was an entertaining comedy starring one of the most popular actors and singers in Italy nowadays. The title 'Quo vado?' may send to serious philosophical and even Biblical connotations, but it's actually a light-heart comedy about the Italy and Europe of today.It's probably good not to take this film too seriously, especially using the political correctness filter. The main hero is a mid-class, mid-age, bold type living with his parents and enjoying what seems to be a for-life bureaucratic public servant position in a small place somewhere in Italy. One sunny day the skies fall on his head, as his job is going to be terminated because of an efficiency campaign. He either should resign, pocket some termination bonus and give up the good life, or fight for his job - which means being sent to all extreme places to perform the extreme job an Italian clerk is supposed to perform. The hero is sexist, ethnic prejudices and stereotypes abound, and he undeservedly accommodates any place and gets the smart and beautiful girl at the end (who just happens to have three different kids of three different races without having evener been married. No-PC? Thanks, God! Funny? yes - most of the time. Original? Not really, but who cares as long as we have a good time.Director Gennaro Nunziante relies on a script that could be as well the skeleton of a theater comedy or musical show, and on his leading star actor Checco Zalone who is apparently popular enough in Italy to assume the risk of lending his name to the hero. A few holy cows are tickled just enough not to cause too many waves and allow for the good spirit of comedy to prevail. It's easy but not stupid entertainment, and with this state of mind many viewers will enjoy it, I believe."
