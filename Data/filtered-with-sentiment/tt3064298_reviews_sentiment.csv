" Very enjoyable
",0.4927,0.9696,2021-03-27 00:00:00,7,"A really good British Romantic comedy starring Simon Pegg and Lake Bell who were both perfect for the lead role. The plot is a fairly novel one, where a guy mistakes somebody for his blind date, and she goes along with it. Well acted with plenty of laughs, would definitely recommend this to Rom-com lovers."
" Great twist, but very rewatchaboe
",0.3716,0.875,2021-02-04 00:00:00,9,"I bought this on DVD as a moment of curiosity, loved it first time round, still get the same butterflies and giggles even having watched it maybe twice a year since 2016.
Rory Kinnear is Hilarious in his bits, throws himself right into it, heart, soul and body hair ðŸ˜‚
I've just realised the writer also did Casual, so that's up the top of the list"
" Best rom-com I've seen in years!
",0.6696,0.9745,2020-08-10 00:00:00,10,"After watching ""Man up"" for the first time a couple of weeks ago, it became instantly one of my favourite films. I can safely say it's the best rom-com I've seen in years. It's funny, it's witty, the soundtrack is great and Simon Pegg & Lake Bell are just adorable. LOVE IT!"
" Strange Little Mess
",-0.4601,-0.6162,2020-07-19 00:00:00,3,"I thought this movie would be rather predictable. But it wasn't.
Which is unfortunate because it went in a MUCH worse direction.
In fact it is a predictable story, in the way that you know exactly how it will end. But very unpredictable on how it wil
It starts out rather clever but goes downhill very fast somewhere in the middle. . It becomes Vastly unrealistic and foolish. Riddled with awkward inappropriate unfunny jokes.seems like it was written by the quirky bisexual girl in middle school.What strange little movie. It took a lot of strange roads.
Just wildly stupid.
How this movie has fantastic reviews is blows my freaking mind."
" Love the script, acting, directing. Very rewatchable!
",0.6696,0.992,2020-07-06 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie during COVID-19 Shelter in Place and love it so much I have seen it maybe 5 times in one month. I was surprised to find out Lake Bell is not really British. Her accent sounds so real. This movie made me into a huge Simon Pegg fan. The comic timing and delivery between these two was amazing in this film. The rest of the cast was great too, especially Rory Kinnear, who played Sean. I loved how over-the-top he played his part. The movie really delivers on the two central characters really getting to know each other in a short time and being surprised by what becomes of it. What a great climactic ending as well. Highly recommend as one of my favorite love stories."
" Brilliant...I genuinely love this movie!!!

" Overly Americanised, needlessly judgemental
",0.0,0.9874,2020-02-26 00:00:00,3,"I went into this with high hopes, as I like Simon Pegg, and for sure there's some nice humour in this film that echoes the likes of Spaced and - more recently - Fleabag.However, the humour is let down by the obvious attempt to broaden the film's appeal, and this gives it a dumbed-down feeling. I love America and American humour by itself, but the Americanisation of British humour here feels incredibly forced and jarring. This kind of approach probably fails to fully satisfy neither British people nor Americans.It doesn't help that the story is cringe-worthily corny - especially the end.But the final straw for me was the needlessly judgemental treatment of age-gap relationships.I get that the writer wanted someone 'obviously' not right for Simon Pegg's character, but why all the focus on the fact that his original date is 16 years younger? Why not make it someone with just a very different personality? As things were, they may as well have cast someone Asian or black, or from a working class background - it would have been no less offensive in my eyes.I happen to be in a relationship right now with someone 15 years younger than myself, but no, I'm not in a midlife crisis, and I've also been in relationships with people many years older than me. My mother and father had a similar age gap. What I've come to learn from life is that humans are individuals, regardless of age, and that it's the individual you fall in love with - not some particular crude attribute.Clearly, ageism and age-related stigmas are still an acceptable thing, not just in film-making but in many walks of life. I wonder how many romances were prevented from flourishing because of this simplistic thinking?"

But I enjoyed this film so much i thought I'd make the effort.The cast are what inspired me to watch and all play their parts exceptionally well - especially the obnoxious Rory Kinnear. I'd never heard of Lake Bell before but she definitely stole each scene she was in, and I was surprised to discover she's American.The film was the perfect length and also the perfect pace, never leaving you feeling bored yet not hurried either.I really enjoyed watching this movie, it was a novel idea, fun and feel-good and definitely brightened my day!"
" British comedies rock!

Simon Pegg and Lake Bell have oodles of chemistry, and there are some really funny scenes between them. It doesn't hurt that it's a British film, and everything sounds funnier in a British accent.Grade: A-"
" Man Up may mark an attitude shift resulting in 'rom-com' no longer being dirty words in cinema
",-0.6249,0.9769,2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Repeat relationship ruiner, Nancy (Lake Bell) decides to finally take a chance with her love life after an awkward run-in on the train leaves her in the right place at the right time to pretend she is the blind date Jack (Simon Pegg) is waiting on.Nancy fumbles along pretending to be Jessica and the pair end up having the best first date of their lives, until a toe-curling figure from Nancy's past blows her cover.It's films like Man Up that remind you British films are just better than their glossy American counterparts, with their inauthentic overblown gestures and impossibly beautiful casts.Every inch of the script rings true and each character bounces off each other as skilfully as Richard Curtis' Four Weddings crew did two decades ago.Pegg breaks free from his King of the geeks reputation and puts in a layered, emotional performance as a proper romantic lead. Bell is in a league of her own, however, as an American actress playing the Bridget Jones type better than Renee Zellweger herself, perfect accent and all.Man Up may mark an attitude shift resulting in 'rom-com' no longer being dirty words in cinema."

" Okay. Teen Romcom plot with older cast
",0.2263,0.9922,2019-07-20 00:00:00,6,"Okay this film was alright. Short, funny in parts, storyline a bit too simplistic maybe but also nice to not have any hipster cynicism found in most love movies starring, and/or about city based thirty-something rave culture post indie hybrids. It wasn't trying to be like an episode of This Life. That being said it was too derivative. For the end and how Pegg gets to where he wants to be, I was smiling at how it made me think of the end of the hilarious Not Another High School Movie and the airport scene parodying the obligatory assistance from unlikely groups of public to help the hero get the girl.
It's not good to be laughing at a spoof of a scene from a movie lampooning its clicheed hackneyed approach that came out ac decade before.
So the lazy copycat scenes aside I thought it was watchable.
I don't agree with the one and two star reviews but everyone is entitled to an opinion and accept that viewpoint. However what I just cannot accept is people saying its 9 or 10 out of 10. So they are saying it ranks along such romantic comedies as As Good As it Gets, Me Myself and Irene, Ten Things I Hate About You, Crocodile Dundee, or Jerry Maguire? They must be because same genre and the marks can't get any better.
Wow."

Simon Pegg played an excellent 40 yr old divorcee and the dance scene to Duran Duran and what followed topped it all off. Watch it everyone, you won't regret it! :)"

Through some unusual events, she manages to steal another woman's blind date. She passes herself off as Jessica (Ophelia Lovibond) as she has a great time with Jack (Simon Pegg) who has his own emotional issues.The film is a romantic comedy. Lake Bell nails it. It is more comedy than romance and has a great classic rock sound track to boot. Would make a decent date film.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Sex talk."
" Ok, if nothing else is on
",0.296,-0.8201,2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,"The advertisements for this make it appear that there will be something wrong with the experience or wacky, which is why I ignored it most of the times I was looking for something. However, it is sort of a typical romance movie. As stated Nancy is very frustrated with poor blind dates she has been on and her family harping on the fact she is single at 34. On a train to her parents anniversary party she meets a woman who is about to go on a blind date. Via a series of mistakes Nancy ends up being mistaken for the blind date and after a minute of her date talking to her... decides to go with it. The rest of the movie is that very long date over one 6 hour or so period. Ultimately this worked because of Pegg and Bell. Both seemed like genuinely likable people who could fall for each other based on having lots in common. The good was that there were several funny / adorable moments for the couple... the bad news was that there wasn't any UST or real indication of attraction."
" Rory Kinnear alias Sean steals the show
",-0.5106,0.4767,2018-10-10 00:00:00,3,"Verbal and visual diarrhoea is not a term I would usually use, except when it is appropriate as in this movie. Rated suitable for age 12 and up the viewer is safe from being soaked though. So displeasing and dramatically weaker from Act to Act I asked myself why I kept coming back to this chatterbox movie and discovered it was the hilariously funny performance of Rory Kinnear alias Sean, who should definitely be considered for a sequel in Amsterdam. Probably one of the few movies where the two main protagonists slide off the table, at which the third cast wipes up the mess - in every sense."
" Funny. Heartwarming. Filled with alcohol. All the stuff you want from a rom com.
",0.743,0.9737,2018-08-06 00:00:00,8,"I adored this. Simon Pegg talks a lot which is awesome because I do think I'd leave my husband for him and I'd hate to go to all that divorce stuff for a guy with no conversation.
Lake Bell who I love has a great accent which helps and is genuinely likeable for an American playing a Brit. Well done you. All in all, yes it's got a montage but it's a montage that makes you wish you were on that date....not like a Rocky montage that makes you grateful you're not a boxer. I score it slightly less for Nancy's dreadful jumper. A happy thumbs up all round."

In a modern romcom (which this is supposed to be) it is so easy to meet and check out the other person online. ""Blind dates"" are probably no longer possible! Of course you're not supposed to think about what's going on here too much."

",0.7414,0.9299,2018-02-14 00:00:00,8,"Some folks when they smile you can practically see every tooth in their mouth. Lake Bell is one of those people, and when she does, she lights up the screen. This is you're typical feel-good rom-com, and it is exceptionally well cast with numerous quality actors giving solid performances. With smart dialogue perfectly delivered. The two leads have chemistry and timing that makes the whole thing work. Were you to watch it again it would still have life.. it is one of those productions that is fairly timeless."
" The Brits still know how to make great comedies
",0.7783,0.9934,2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Man Up' is a really well made & executed romantic-comedy. It's a simple story - the old blind-date mix-up, where Jake (Pegg) meets Nancy (Bell), both disillusioned with relationships, but they happen to find each other and have a great night out, before it's revealed that she's not his intended blind date.Very fast-paced (only 85min long), with no time for dull moments, and plenty of laughs throughout to keep everyone happy. Williams is great as the creepy/stalker-ish 'friend' and Lovibond plays the starry-eyed, optimistic intended blind-dater. The soundtrack is great and there's some fun/memorable scenes, including the teens running through the streets, the race to the bar and the fire extinguisher.What really makes the film work is Pegg's unflappable charm and his chemistry with Bell, who's the real star - endearing and unassuming, she's cute, but also witty and just enjoyable to watch. It's also refreshing to see Pegg doing something simple. In this film's case, easy doesn't = poor."
" Sweet and endearing
",0.4588,0.9783,2017-11-19 00:00:00,6,"Man Up is a real feel-good film, with great performances from Simon Pegg and Lake Bell which really help you to connect with the characters and feel invested in the story.Plot-wise it's really nothing new, a simple girl meets boy situation with some hiccoughs on the way to an inevitable happy ending. However, within the simple plot are some genuinely funny moments, including the awkward encounter with a former schoolmate of Bell's character, played brilliantly by Rory Kinnear. What's more, interspersed amongst these moments is some emotional depth, sadly more often than not lacking in most rom-coms.Although nothing new, it is heartwarming and definitely worth a watch if it happens to be on TV as I'm sure it will be, especially over the Christmas period."
" Needed a Hugh Grant type
",0.3612,0.9638,2017-08-20 00:00:00,6,"Man Up is inspired by the Richard Curtis rom-coms. It teams up an American star with a British actor. Nancy (Lake Bell) who feels unlucky in love and feeling life is passing her by ends up mistakenly going on a blind date with Jack (Simon Pegg) who is still affected from a recent divorce.Both strike up a good rapport sharing similar interests in music and movies despite Nancy being stalked all evening by a former school friend who she had a chance encounter with at a bar. Meanwhile Jack bumps with his ex wife and her new lover.This is a feel good film with a good blend of comedy, romance and cynicism. The Rory Kinnear character is too obnoxious and I think Pegg is not quite right for this type of rom-coms."

I didn't know Lake Bell was American.I thought her accent was flawless but whilst I'm no Prof Higgins, I am a Brit.Judging from her performance I would say she is one of the great Lakes. Also, in the style of Curtisland, the film is stuffed with British luvvies in bit parts,acting their little luvvie socks off.BUT no Bill Nighy!Yes ,quite a successful romcom.I liked it a lot ,with reservations.Well nothing's perfect,is it?"
" A tale of two halves
",0.0,0.8929,2017-08-02 00:00:00,5,"After a laughless first half-an-hour, I came very close to giving up on this one. It was practically identical to the first half-an-hour of every other romcom I've seen, only without the humour. Pegg is a great actor and a funny guy, but his performance was boring me. Likewise, I didn't take an instant shining to Lake Bell's character either.I did stick with it though, and thankfully the second half of the film is a lot more rewarding that the first half. The story picks up, the humour is more prevalent and, despite the very obvious ending, there's a lot more to like in the second half. Ultimately, 'Man Up' ends up somewhere in the middle - average."
" Who Let This Dog Out?!

I love Simon Pegg and, until now, have never been disappointed in him. The actress was quite talented and if facial gymnastics alone could make a movie, she would have made this one.The problem was the script. ClichÃ©d. Forced. Tedious. And above all, NOT FUNNY. To me, this one was cringe-worthy, not a chuckle-fest. My husband agreed so we bailed early.If it got better later on, it still wasn't worth sitting through until then."
" Mini-masterpiece despite manifesting the weak as well as strong suits of British Rom-Coms
",0.7786,0.9969,2017-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Like many other British romantic comedies, Ben Palmer's ""Man Up"" gets an immediate head start by being able to draw on the vast wealth of UK popular music. Here we have snippets of Paloma Faith, Duran Duran, Whitesnake and Elbow to name but four, and this gives just an inkling of the diversity on offer in Britain, and in this rather-less-lightweight-than-it-seems British comedy offering. And, given that the number of people (aside from myself) who can claim to like all four of these groups/performers must be close to zero, and given that all are nevertheless worked seamlessly and ingeniously into the content of the film, we can see the makers' triumphantly successful interest in reconciling different tastes and overcoming apparent divisions and difficulties that actually represents a hallmark of their film (just as they were hallmarks of ""About a Boy"", ""Love Actually"" and many others).Repeatedly, and with increasing intensity as the 86 minutes pass, we are shown how young and old might work together, and how people who ought to be resentful of each other can find some synergistic magic to allow all to come out ahead.This is then the pleasant and surprisingly powerful watching that accompanies a simple enough story of deliberately concealed blind-date identity featuring Simon Pegg as Jack and the intriguing-looking Lake Bell as not-Jessica-but-Nancy. The latter is American, but you would never know it, and she has a quite endearing ability to move from being relatively unattractive to super-attractive from one moment to another. There's never a dull moment on that score, and all the more so given the likable nature of her character.Indeed, Pegg and Bell do surprisingly well together, and one has to concede that the acting is actually of a pretty reasonable standard.This is not an uproariously funny film (and for me that's good, given that it's a reflection of a certain world-weary realism). Indeed - as the clear downside of this, like so many other recent British films, no opportunity is lost to recall and emphasise the key, nay sine qua non, role of alcohol in British social life. This lionisation of a drug that would obviously represent an instant crime were any other substance to be involved is perhaps - sadly - a reflection of real life, but it is also miserable, and all the more since the movie makes no bones about the fact that these people are not getting any true happiness out of the bottle, only ""drowning their sorrows"" in time-honoured fashion.A further point to criticise, and something that this film shares with ""Bridget Jones"" and other British stuff, is the entirely fake belief that laughs can be milked by the extremely regular use of four-letter words.Given these very noticeable downsides, it is surprising that the overall impact of ""Man UP"" is remarkably positive, primarily for the reason mentioned above.As a whole piece, then, this is really a presentation of eccentric, self-conscious, sometimes crude yet well-meaning Brits that is smooth, cool in its uncoolness, likable and sympathetic; and also surprisingly meaningful in its treatment of loneliness, the pressures of modern life, and the yearning for love that represents the great leveller for just about all of us. Ultimately, it is just nice to watch, and well worth watching - and I surprise myself by writing this, given that I had no major expectations at all."
