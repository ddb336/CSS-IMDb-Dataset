" Good but confusing
",-0.1027,-0.431,2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,"A good movie not made in Hollywood, lots of good scenery, plenty of blood and guts. Unfortunately as the film went on, I lost track of what the storyline was meant to be: my bad. I am sure that this movie deserves more, but I seem to have missed the point."
" Very boring
",-0.3804,-0.7681,2021-03-22 00:00:00,3,"No seriously
The plot is like the stuff we used to play when we were kids... so boring, bad acting, and lots of bla bla bla!!!"
" Worth the watch!!
",0.3578,0.9602,2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,"I've seen this movie multiple times!! It's like the first time watching it, every time! Wonderful movie with the most perfect actors for these roles! Clive Owens and Morgan Freeman can NOT disappoint in a movie! :)"
" Modern period
",0.0,0.6808,2021-03-10 00:00:00,1,An interesting remake. However director forgot to tell actors it is a period piece. American accents all over. Morgan is a good actor just not in period movies.
" Very, very good and is downrated unjustly
",0.5379,-0.2108,2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,"A very good story about medieval knights losing their master due to corruption of those above him and taking their revenge. There are some tense moments where you can really feel the dilemma someone faces. For those that want bloody continues fight scenes that make no historical sense, this movie isn't for you. But this is one of the movies in a long time where I even forgot I had a phone. Giving it 10 stars because the current rating doesn't do the movie just and because it's worth it."
" Not bad at all !
",0.484,0.8915,2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,"Nice atmosphere, original worldbuilding, compelling characters.The movie would be very good with better fight scenes. They felt too generic, with too many cuts.Much better than Keanu 47 ronin, which was boring."
" So boring, predictable, and low ...
",-0.5709,0.7845,2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,I do not know who writes good reviews about this movie. 47 ronin is a masterpiece when you vompare it to this one.This movie just opened a special category - a complete waste of time...
" Excellent movie. Just be patient with the middle.
",0.5719,0.6545,2021-01-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie has an excellent cast. While the overall plot line is a common one, the details of the character's individual path to the ending is diverse. Many people complain about the slog through the middle (which is somewhat slow), but the details fleshed out through this section make the ending that much more brilliant. I think we are accustomed to the pop version of movies from Disney that we cannot appreciate a movie with substance. It's Alexander Dumas, not Danielle Steele."

" Not brilliant... far from
",0.0,-0.9343,2021-01-13 00:00:00,3,"So, what turned me off completely was the wrong color grading and the lights used at the set. In a forest with fire mixed with hard white lights doesn't make sense to me. Overall the look and feel is not very good.
Weird thing with bad movies is you often forget you've seen them and after a while you find yourself watching that certain bad movie again thinking.... dejavoo!"
" Wow....
",0.0,0.6055,2021-01-12 00:00:00,4,"It's funny because the acting is quite good and the writing is ok. But the rest is very cliche, and the setting is often laughable."

",0.2023,0.9363,2021-01-12 00:00:00,6,"The last nights is just fine, great actors OK storyline very well delivered somehow and this is that extra it needed to put it in great category"
" A missed opportunity
",0.1531,-0.876,2021-01-10 00:00:00,5,"This is a great story, but, alas, the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired. I might mention fight scenes where the protagonist stands with his back to an aggressor with a drawn sword, and the aggressor simply moves to the side of his foe, in order to be beaten together with his three friends.The blatant lack of loyalty to the wife and daughter of their master is also baffling, allowing them to live a life where they can be sold into prostitution. Even leaving the daughter of their master in a brothel over night, to probably loose her honor by force- while they propose to restore her fathers honor! If this is the level of sacrifice they will go to, in order to avenge their master, then ok, I'll suspend my disbelief a moment, but when they later retrieve her they still don't seem to return to their duty of protecting and serving the heir of their master. Wtf. Things like this made my suspension of disbelief waver so much that I could not enjoy my self, alas."
" A good medieval film.
",0.4404,0.9353,2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"An European version of 47 Ronin. I liked it a lot. Though it could have a longer running time to make longer build up of the planning towards the end and character development.Freeman delivers as always. Owen is spot on with this role. For me to see Norwegian (countryman) Aksel Hennie play the foe so good was pleasant.The score and atmosphere went hand in hand and I liked the way the story folded.
Action scenes were brilliant.Recommend it highly."
" political correctness
",0.0,0.3612,2021-01-08 00:00:00,1,"Movies plot was terribly slow....Period of knights ended in late 1500 century...name me just 1 black/japanese lord or knight from this period of time.
At least in Robin Hood from 1991, Morgan Freeman´s role, was well explained, well played and trustworthy
In the last knights, multietnical persons are sprinkled into the story, as a terrible excample of political correctness.."
" Waste of my time
",-0.4215,-0.5121,2021-01-05 00:00:00,2,"When I saw Morgan Freeman in the list, I was assured this had to be a solid movie.
Ofcourse his role was perfect but short.After that I saw so many cliché scènes that I lost count, but never a good one.Bad acting, louzy CGI, unbelievable script, total waste of your time."
" Deserves a higher rating
",0.0,0.9218,2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Not a mindless action flick. I was surprised by how good this movie was compared to the rating it had on imdb.
The movie at it's heart is a tale of loyalty and the sacrifices some people will make to uphold that loyalty."
" Bad Casting
",-0.5423,-0.775,2021-01-04 00:00:00,3,"What were they thinking? Morgan Freeman is indeed the best but as king , for me a big no no. Except Clive all other actors were a big no no. That emperor couldn't even speak properly. I had to turn on subs. Goshh"
" Enjoyable to watch
",0.4404,0.775,2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"The atmosphere was good. Acting is good. The story is maybe less, but the movie was enjoyable to watch"
" Great
",0.6249,0.8674,2020-12-30 00:00:00,8,"Last Knights is a medieval action movie with an international cast and crew. The film has a unique style that is mostly Western European, but also has a bit of Japanese samurai culture in there to set this apart from a more routine hack and slash production. The film is all about chivalry and honor. This elite group of knights must band together to avenge an injustice and stamp out political corruption in this ancient world picture. The film looks sharp and there is plenty of action, which was choreographed well. The acting is excellent and Clive Owens is impressive as the lead here with one of his finest performances. In my opinion this deserved a wide theatrical run and is criminally underrated and we'll done."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.8866,2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,Powerful and I'm simply lost for words!! Thoroughly enjoyed and loved every minute of it!!!
" A entertaining medieval action film.
",0.4404,-0.7998,2020-12-11 00:00:00,7,"I was surprised at this film. I enjoyed it. Clive Owen is one of my favourite British actors and he always puts in a great dramatic performance, even in a medieval action film like this one.
His descent from a brave, noble warrior to a disgraced drunkard is very convincing. As he falls into his own self pity and destruction from the dishonour of killing his master. However the reveal in the latter part of the story arguably spoils the payoff of a character redeeming himself from losing his purpose.
Which I feel is a problem with a lot of the supporting characters also, there is very little character development. They just are. But yet we're supposed to feel something for them when they sacrifice themselves for the cause without really knowing them.
Gezza Mott, the Minister is a snivelling, petty, ruthless and cold villain in a similar vein as Joffrey from Game of Thrones. However he is a lot more Cookie cutter villain than Joffrey. But He does his job as he makes it very easy to hate him.
This film doesn't really add anything new or special to the genre, but it's entertaining in its action scenes and in its simple story of revenge. If you don't think any deeper than that or expect something of epic proportions like Lord of the Rings and just take the film and characters as they are, just fully formed entities who exacting revenge. You can enjoy it."
" Emperor is so funny
",0.5777,-0.6378,2020-10-23 00:00:00,7,"Watchable good movie and it's so suitable for an evening entertaining mood, but the cast was need so enrichment names especially emperor,even his voice tone was so weak and hard to imagine him as a powered emperor.well done at overall."
" Has its moments but overall pretty poor
",0.0387,-0.5249,2020-10-11 00:00:00,4,The cast deserve a lot better the script and story as a whole are at its generic worst with many of the fringe cast remarkably robotic the leads you expect and know can do so much more but are far to restricted by the constraints of the script and story. The added decision to have virtually no blood and guts despite its 15 rating is also puzzling the action scenes feel remarkably like a play fight and don't immerse you at all.
" ToManyChinese
",0.0,0.3716,2020-07-24 00:00:00,2,Film is great but it has to much chinese/Japan characters(for sake of director ) which is unusual for that period of history.
" Good exciting film but has a bad ending
",-0.4019,-0.9448,2020-05-07 00:00:00,8,"I liked the story i like the lead character and the gang. liked the why they spoke cool Quotes/speeches likeThe commander speech before that event before The invasion.
The commander: honor is something that all men are born with. It cannot be taken from you nor can it be granted. It must only not be lost. We now stand at the final door of our final act.
We will reclaim what they tried to take, we will restore the name of our master, the voice of our people and the spirit of our NATION. ( last knights )It would have been a 10. this is how much i liked this film but they died in the end.
The master died. The lead died the gang i think died i don't remember. but what is important is that the lead character died and that deducts points from the film"

" Uninspiring
",0.0,0.1779,2020-01-29 00:00:00,2,"This film has the unique ability to make an already too long of 2+ hour running time feel like 5 hours. Storyline is terrible, acting is so-so and overall a sludge of a movie."
" Japan legend retold
",0.0,0.9652,2020-01-12 00:00:00,8,"I usually do not like period stories done in a different milieu or country. Is it 'cultural appropriation'? I wonder if the Japanese have done Robin Hood?However I liked this as Owen carried the story well. Freeman was a dignified patriarch as usual. However the latter was never allowed to
put up a proper defence of his fight with the minister, and Owen who witnessed a part of it was not allowed to speak at all! Hardly a fair trial. The Emperor was rather a cardboard figure and accepted whatever his minister said. Although he claimed to be using him for his own purposes. Whatever that was never appeared. The attack on the supposedly 'impregnable' castle also seemed rushed and too simple. However what impressed me was Owen's performance of the 'broken' man descending into alcoholism, even 'rejecting' his loving wife. He had me fooled anyway! All in all nice piece of mediaeval action"

" Really Good Movie!
",0.54,0.9798,2019-12-22 00:00:00,9,"First i watched the movie, then read the reviews and surprised why this movie had such negative reviews. Watched it with great excitement. Really good actors and great storyline. Clive Owen was amazing as usual and the cast was also great. I really recommend the movie! Enjoy it."
" Interesting first act, yawn-worthy second act, and fantastic third act
",0.743,0.9908,2019-12-12 00:00:00,7,"If this whole movie were as fine as its third act, I would have given it another star or two and added it to my (very small) DVD collection.Last Knights is a very different take on the story of the 47 Ronin. The director Kazuaki Kiriya's entire roster of films has been on my radar for quite some time, but due to limited availability this is the first one I've watched. Last Knights has the gritty, fantastical feel of a dark fantasy movie; it has no magic, but its diverse cast and vague politics give it an otherworldly feel that I greatly enjoyed. Clive Owen plays Raiden, a retainer to Bartok (Morgan Freeman). After Bartok is killed and dishonored, Raiden and his men form a plan to avenge their former master despite very real and sometimes fatal consequences.As stated in the title of this review, the first act is interesting in its own right. We are introduced to the characters and the political game they play that sets up for the entire movie. It's not complicated and easily accessible. The second act (after Bartok's demise) slows the movie to a crawl, made worse by the fact that there are very few action scenes in the entire movie (only two worthy to really be called scenes at all, and the only one of length is saved for the third act). Without delving into spoilers, I can say that Raiden's darker character arc here dragged on for me. He became truly unlikable, and whether or not you can guess the ""twist"" leading into the third act, it was still a drag. Nevertheless, we are shown more insight into how things have progressed for both sides of this political divide.My eyes were glued to the screen for the entire third act. We are treated to a wonderfully long action-oriented build-up as Raiden's men infiltrate and fight their way through a fortress utilizing stealth and finesse. Some recognizable characters die heroically here, but as wonderfully as these death scenes are handled, they would have made me far more emotional had the second act delved more into character development for these men (rather than focusing on Raiden). Other than that criticism, I can totally see myself re-watching the third act for this entire sequence alone; if you like watching takeovers, sieges, or infiltration missions in general like I do, Last Knights is not a movie to miss.All the actors do a fine job here. Payman Maadi sounds a little stilted as the Emperor, but his accent usually sounds stiff (I recently saw him in the film Camp X-Ray and I think this is just the way he talks), and at least he ain't bad to look at. Speaking of which, there are a surprising number of actors here who I'll be looking out for based on eye candy alone (Ihara Tsuyoshi, Michael Lombardi, Noah Silver, among some others). Aksel Hennie plays the sneaky snake Geza Mott, who is a delight to watch (and hate). There are two gorgeous decapitations to look out for, neither of which I saw coming (and neither did they, ha). It's rare that a movie portrays mutilations with such swift beauty, but this one does it twice. Finally, the winter vistas and gritty atmospheres on display here just sucked me right into this world and didn't let up until the credits rolled. Bravo.Overall, Last Knights has flaws that some won't get past, but that its critic Metascore is so low reinforces my distrust of critic reviews. It may not be the most original story put to film, and viewers may disagree with the creative changes made to a well-loved story. Yet, I enjoyed it immensely and will put some of its finest clips on my favorites list on YouTube to watch repeatedly. Lovers of dark fantasy and/or dark historical films: don't miss this."

",0.4389,0.9716,2019-09-21 00:00:00,10,"I truly enjoyed this movie! I've watched it more than twice maybe even 3 times. I won't go into details because there's plenty of other people on this site who have done a great job explaining and given the movie the positive criticism it deserves. The movie is long but it explains every detail of what some soldiers daily lives look like after their home is taken away. I felt as if it were realistic in that aspect. Love the loyalty trust and respect for one another. Something to look forward to throughout the movie. I feel, after reading the negative 1 star comments, that those people unfairly rated this movie. I know that Asian films can get pretty gory when sword fighting is involved, not a particular fan, but this one I could stomach. Was definitely looking forward to a sequel. Sometimes evil has to be extinguished even if you have to go all the way to the top."
" Highly underrated
",0.0,0.9733,2019-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Some of the best films made by western cinema have often been drawn from Japanese stories, and this is a throwback to that. This film is effectively a reinterpretation of the 47 Ronin story (original, not the movie), and it does so beautifully. Visually stunning, and with excellent action choreography, the film delivers on excitement, while giving a story that is compelling (though obviously not original) Well worth the watch"

This movie had a big beautiful world I wanted to know more about, all the movie had to offer was fight scenes and cliches. I saw someone compare this to gladiator.

" Great action, good plot, a bit generic

And a year later they decide to take revenge. Clive Owen plays his role as the commander very well, and his legions also do a good job. The epic fight scenes appear well choreographed and the plot has a good element of twists.But overall it felt a bit generic. Definitely low budget cgi work, the characters don't have a lot of depth, some of the scenes were a bit long. And the ending, while noble and stoic, left something to be desired."

" PLOT = SILLY
",0.0258,-0.9888,2019-08-23 00:00:00,1,"The movie - ""Last Knights""
1) A petulant king, that knows his ministers are corrupt and embezzling from his subjects, chooses to unconditionally support his corrupt ministers over the people. Even though the king himself does not collect bribes, the king says ""nobody better not touch my corrupt minister."" This petulant king tells his corrupt minister that although he, the minister, is corrupt, no one should dare insult his minister on pain of death. Why? ... Well, because the petulant king says ""his minister is an (figurative) extension of the king."" Me, the reviewer says: ""it couldn't possibly be because the king is an idiot - written into the movie as an idiot by the not so talented script writers.""
2) A Nobleman and head of a wealthy province (Morgan Freeman), allows himself to be killed at the whim of his petulant king, to prove ... something ... I guess ... Reviewer (Me): ""I'm still trying to figure this one out, but it sure seems like the noble reason is pure stupidity or seriously bad script writing.""
3) A warrior retainer, of the seventh rank (Clive Owen), to a Nobleman (Morgan Freeman), allows himself to be killed, but only after the petulant king, sitting in a winter garden scene, gives the warrior retainer some long-timed stink eye. The warrior retainer even kneels to take his punishment (a beheading), to prove ... something ... a point .. I guess.
4) Then comes the middle and most of the movie, which is lots of drinking and even more ""face in the gutter"" groveling followed by an incomprehensible rebirth of the ""good-guy"" warriors. Then lots of fighting with a healthy dose of Shaolin monk style wannabes.
5) End of movie. One Star.
6) Post Script (post end of movie review). The movie reviewer, finding this movie so silly, that he writes this ridiculous review only because he is irritated that he got suckered into watching this movie because of the fairly decent ensemble of actors. The movie reviewer writes to prove ... something ... a point ... I think ... or maybe simply that he realizes he should have written the review as follows: ""Plot = Silly (read: stupid). One Star."""

" Last Knights - Worth a watch!
",0.2942,-0.9123,2019-08-13 00:00:00,6,"I randomly stumbled upon this film on Netflix and decided to give it a go, based solely off of the trailer and the actors that were in the movie. I believe this movie doesn't get any sort of attention that is may deserve, as the plot while sort of cliche also has some originality to it.This movie follows Raiden and his group of knights that are belonged to a one Lord Bartok, played by Morgan Freeman. After lord Bartok is accused of trying to kill a high member of the table, he is to be executed by his very own protector, Raiden. This movie then follows the group of knights as they plan to infiltrate the castle and kill the man responsible for the death of there lord.One thing that really hurt the score of this film for me was the sound design, which is something I never really complain about. There were some really cool shots and fights in this movie that were all toned down with very poor sound design. Overall made it seem less real and convincing. The movies execution and story make it a film worth watching."

" Great fantasy movie
",0.6249,0.9956,2019-04-19 00:00:00,8,"I recently discovered this movie on Tubi TV. I decided to give it a chance after seeing great actors, Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman on the thumbnail. I made a great choice and thoroughly enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. As I write this, I am listening to the score of this movie which was truly haunting, sad, yet epic. The story location and time was vague, but I think it's based on ancient Italy during the ending times of the Moors, which I think the character of Lord Bartok (Morgan Freeman) is based off of. It's simply the tale of an era coming to an end about men who lived by a code of honor and an easily manipulated emperor's right hand man Geza Mott (Askel Hennie) being allowed to bribe the leaders of different sectors in their kingdom to either deal with him or lose everything including their land, wealth, and title. Bartok is forced to travel to the capital city with his right hand man Raiden (Clive Owen) and his men, the last knights of their kingdom. Raiden is the Commander of the Seventh Rank and also a former wayward drunk in his youth who Lord Bartok took under his wing and helped him changed his life around. When Bartok defies the emperor's right hand man Geza Mott and rejects Geza Mott's attempt to bribe him, Geza Mott tries to kill a dying Bartok and threatens to seize his land and wealth, evict his people, and erase the Bartok family name from history. Lord Bartok gets the best of him and nearly kills him after the guards stop them. In court, Bartok gives a brilliant speech about honor before the emperor and the other noblemen who had succumbed to Geza Mott's bribes. He admits he regretted not killing Geza Mott and is sentenced to death. Geza Mott cruelly forces Raiden to kill Bartok. Raiden refuses to killed the man he loved like a father and is ordered to do so by Lord Bartok. Raiden kills Lord Bartok by beheading and Geza Mott fears Raiden will seek revenge against him for forcing him to murder his lord.
The Last Knight has a great score with characters you care about. One of my favorites was the score for the eviction scene. Cliff Curtis was great as Raiden's second in command Lt. Cortez. Michael Lombardi did a wonderful job being the young eager knight Josiah wanting to prove himself. Hannah Rose Caton as Lord Bartok's daughter Lily was beautiful along with his wife Maria played by the lovely Shohreh Aghdasloo. Aylet Zurer (Vanessa from Netflix's Daredevil series) was amazing as Raiden's beautiful wife Naomi. Her role was only a few scenes but she quickly established her character as strong, loving wife who was in a loving relationship with her husband and could read his inner thoughts.Watching the fall of Raiden back to alcoholism as Geza Mott evicted everyone from Bartok's lands was devastating and you felt the pain of Naomi watching her husband's descent back into darkness. You cared about his soldiers. I liked the character who was also Geza Mott's right hand man too and the final scene between him and Raiden. When a character dies, you mourned their loss. Anyone who has morals, an inner code of honor, and still believe in honor amongst men could relate to this movie about men living to a code of honor in a dishonorable world. The fight scenes were bloody and awesome and you never know when a beloved character may be killed off. Even with the final ambiguous scene, you're left with wonder. This movie lingers in your head for a few days. It's a great movie to escape into for a couple of hours. I really enjoyed it and still listen to the score from time to time."

Bartok is executed and Raiden, with his men, is forced out into the cold and starts to secretely plot their revenge.The story is pretty standard, straightforward but sets does what it is supposed to do, be the reason to all the fighting.

",0.0,0.8074,2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Clive Owens heads this heavy weight medieval psychological, period action piece. This movie stands out for its serious, ponderous script development and adherence to an honor code with sacrifice. Surprisingly significantly shot with much fewer action scenes than most medieval movies, this film focuses as much on the mental and slowly crafted attitudes and behind the scenes development of events to eventual lead to a reveal that is both enthralling and ultimately humbling and bittersweet. In some ways, this movie resembles a medieval version of the great Shakespearean tragedies. The notable other few majestic movies that are entitled to compare with Last Knights include: The Great Wall (2017), Black Death (2010), The Name of the Rose (1986), and Excaliber (1981)."

Well I have been searching on GOOGLE for movies that are similar to Gladiator or King Arthur or Braveheart so that I can quench my thirst after watching a movie with plent of well managed SWORD fights - a movie with knights in it, or with warriors who know how to raise a metal and how to swing a damn blade.So, I found few titles and I picked up this movie for the cast was fairly impressive and I like Clive so much in such roles full of attitude! Honestly, I am a bit surprised with a low rating for this movie this movie is around a 6.8 at least. I rated it a 7 for few reasons that are mentioned below:1. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the acting of almost every one who was given a role. From Morgan Freeman to that kid who died defending the iron gate. Of course, I would bed hollywood to cast Clive Owen more and more for such roles, as his looks are so damn perfect for all of it ! I even request GOT recruiting team to have him on for even only two episodes in the last season (if possible) and besides he has dashing british accent anyways!2. The script was well written. I have to say the dialogues were nicely penned and were having least disappointing moments for the viewers. Hell yea I even found it a bit emotional sometimes during the movie.3. Ending was very well balanced. For a movie like this one, it is not easy to first of begin it with an eye catching scene or scenes and then to finish it off in a way everyone feels satisfactory about. Till the last moment when clive opens his eyes, I felt pretty satiable about the entire movie. I strongly feels there should be another part of it.4. Finally, the stage setting and locations were pretty decent. Soundtrack was not too bad either. I felt it was a combination from some of the Hans Zimmer, but only at few times.Well, such movies are always soothing to watch and I dun know if it is me (as I am a mughal by cast :P) or many others think the same way. This film made me think several times that I should go act for Hollywood for one of my own scripts and I should better start writing one now to make it happen in my dreams after years :)"

" Rather Dull
",-0.4019,0.8798,2018-05-14 00:00:00,3,"Apparently this film was based on the 47 Ronin, but not being familiar with the tale means I can't really comment on how close it really is. Then again, I suspect that I have come across it in the past, and the story is pretty straight forward. Basically the lord of a group of knights is put to death, and the knights end up becoming leaderless. However, behind the scenes they are planning on extracting revenge against the corrupt minister who was behind the lord's death. I'm sure we can pretty much work out what happens then.
 Honestly, this film was rather boring. Well, boring, and in parts difficult to accept. It is set in an unnamed empire which is supposed to be racially tolerant. This really put me off, namely because there was a mix of all races here, something that sort of rubs me in the wrong direction when you are trying to create a medieval world. Sure, it might actually be a fantasy world, but still, it didn't really sit with me all that much, particularly since Western Europe really wasn't all that cosmopolitan back then.
 Okay, there were some good aspects to this film, such as the bad guy. In a way he came across very much like Macbeth, in that he was having nightmares and hallucinations over the fact that he arranged the death of this lord. Maybe it is also due to the fact that he knows that he is a crook, and really can't live with it. I also noticed how he went to great lengths to fortify his palace.
 However, in the end I was pretty glad that it came to an end. It just seemed to drag on for way too long, and while it did finally pick up the pace in the end, it was simply trying to be something that it wasn't."

It's one of those films which slipped under the radar but provides some elements of interest for the genre fan. It certainly looks nice, with every penny of the budget having gone into the costumes and locations, and the otherworldly setting brings to mind the likes of INTO THE BADLANDS and GAME OF THRONES, although it's not quite as authentic or well-realised. Sadly, the plot has some big problems, far too simplistic to sustain the running time, which means that for a big chunk of the middle part of the film the actors have little to do other than sit around and twiddle their thumbs.

Very glad I did. It was, for me, an enjoyable, solid, and faithful retelling of 47 Ronin, with a unique European/Samurai/Byzantine/Hollywood setting. It features lovely scenery/setting and cinematography. The acting is fair to better though the script is a bit wooden in spots. It has a careful build-up as anyone familiar with 47 Ronin (and Samurai films in general) should expect. It won't be for everyone. Lots of meaningful looks and still moments. The two turning points were the great moments I was anxiously awaiting. The reveal and sword-play pay-off for the careful build-up were fully exhilarating and satisfying.

The men's roles were notable, full of testosterone bravado and moral hi ground competition. The costumes were well put together and believable, while producing a borderline sci-fi look. Not unlike a comic book novel, this movie looks to be one that all ages can ride upon the storytelling. I was captured by the elegant elevated values spoken by the stars. I suspect it is good teaching for our young, a hidden education in a diverse cast, crew and production. I recommend it to everyone. Great for budding and young men, but really for all!"

",0.25,-0.987,2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"Last Knights is a special kind of bad movie. It has some decent cinematography. Pretty OK acting. The story is cliché but it's also a good kind of cliché - which is to say that there are a lot of elements to the story that are enjoyable to watch time and time again. Yet - at the same time - this film is just so awful. It's kind of one of those movie ""limbo"" films. The premise is that some knight has to kill his mentor because the mentor insults the emperor. So he feels he loses his honor. Turns into a drunk. Then he has a change of heart - gets his team of knights back together - and goes on a rampage to defeat his enemies and restore his honor. This sounds kinda awesome - except in this film - it's not!One of the weirdest parts of this movie is that it seems to take place in some European land - but there are Asians, Hispanics, blacks, and whites. (Of course the lead is a straight white male - so what really was the point of the diversity?) The casting is so freakishly wonky it's just hard to explain - there is no credibility to the story. None. Most freakish of all is the emperor is just some little Hispanic guy who basically has no presence whatsoever. In fact, none of the villains in this film have any presence. They whine. Talk. Pout. Drink. The heroes also have no presence. They whine. Talk. Pout. Drink. The combat scenes are terrible and the CGI sets are weak sauce. One especially troubling scene is when our hero goes and rescues a woman from a brothel - and the screen just fades to black instead of shows the epic rescue. Big time let down - that was a blown opportunity for an audience to bond with the main character. It is basically an epic film that is not epic. It is so far from epic - what is the polar opposite of epic? Short? Stupid? Boring? Dull? Lame? A total waste of time and space?In general - this film is a movie that is basically a remake of 47 Ronin - but it is just terrible. However, it is not un-watchable. So for that - three stars."
" Good movie to watch on PVR or online
",0.4404,0.8406,2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"I Personally like these medieval stories and since I had it recorded on PVR I was able to FF through some of the sword fight scenes. and shorten the viewing time enough to make it more enjoyable.As I am not a critic and because everyone has different tastes and opinions on what does or does not make for good cinematography or story lines, I will leave it at that and because I need a minimum of 10 text line on my posting, enjoy the movie. lastly I would like to point just one of theGOOFS... I believe it was Maria standing prepping food by the table and I noticed a very modern smooth shiny stainless steel bowl in the center of the table. The props people were definitely not thinking very well."
" Excellent movie, great story line and acting.
",0.8316,0.9628,2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Warning: There are spoilers in this review!!My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. We've watched it several times. We enjoy it every time we sit down to watch it. I love the story line. I disagree that the movie drags. On the contrary, the patience of it is what makes it so good. When you think they have given up and everything is lost is when things start to unfold. To have the patience of the commander, even when he knows he is destroying those around him and their faith in him. It was a great movie and very well put together, down to the cast and costumes. I definitely recommend it. I think rather than borrowing it from our library I will just buy it!!"
