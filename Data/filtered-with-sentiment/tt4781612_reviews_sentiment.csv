" Don't Second Guess If You Should Watch This...You Should!
",0.0,0.3898,2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"This is all about compelling storytelling combining with just as compelling acting.The basic plot of the film is nothing new, many films have covered this material.Its the intricacies of the story that make it work, the interpersonal drama and tension are really powerful.Potter excels again in this movie showing he is an actor to look for when he releases something. He doesn't always hit it out of the park but on this occasion, he does."
" Daniel Radcliffe as you never seen him before
",0.0,0.9777,2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"When a actor gets cemented with a character it's almost impossible to break away from that character. Harrison Ford, Judy Garland and Anthony Perkins are prime examples and they spent the coming years trying in vein to break away from (Star Wars/Indiana Jones, The Wizard Of Oz and Psycho). Here Daniel Radcliffe tries hard to break away from (Harry Potter). This movie though does indeed move into touchy territory (White Supremacists/terrorist) and Radcliffe does his best to portray a FBI agent out to not only prove himself but devurt a terrorist attack and moves a step further in trying to pull away from Harry Potter.The story isn't up to par with such gems as ""American History X"" or other movies in that topic group. Here Nate Foster (Radcliffe) isn't as believable as he should have been. I myself would have had my doubts of him many times. The scene where a couch cushion is showing exposed fabric should have done him in or been searched by the Supremacists and doesn't. In another when he's recognized by someone would have or should have exposed him. And as a outsider he's brought in and shown around and excepted too easily. Still he manages to talk his way out and somehow keep their trust. I understand that this story does take place over several days so it's left to the viewer to believe that the hate group does act on such events.This movie isn't a action movie but an extreme dialogue heavy drama the somehow keeps your attention. A better actor may have been better as Nate Foster but I give Daniel Radcliffe credit for taking on such a role. I love drama's and movies with strong plots and this movie lacks a bit in storyline. A said white supremacists with zero tattoos should have been a red flag but isn't. No background checks on his character (Nate Foster) and no character development makes this movie a bit unbelievable at times.Is it good, I think very good and the actors hold their own. Would I recommend this movie, no as some scene's may not go over good with some people. This one is a movie that could have been better, a movie that could have gone in another direction and a movie that doesn't show us much on character development. In all its a decent pleaser on a boring day/night."
" Harry Potter as a Nazi - doesn't quite work
",0.0,0.8516,2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,"I like Daniel Radcliffe. I think for one of the biggest child actors ever, he's doing his best, taking indie film roles and building a cult following. This foray into the more mainstream alongside Toni Collette and Tracy Letts is brave, but ultimately misguided, as Radcliffe in unconvincing as a neo-Nazi infiltrator.It isn't entirely down to his acting: his performance is not amazing, but I would categorise this as a strange casting choice before then. Furthermore, his diminutive personality is contrary to the role he's been asked to play.The story itself is nothing ground-breaking (in fact, it is a plot I've seen about 100 times), but does take inspiration from a real-life FBI agent's writing. It does, on the other hand, provoke thought by illustrating the sheer volume of Nazi sympathisers in the USA today, as well as taking time to delineate the difference between thugs and organised terrorists.Overall, the film was well-meaning, and had direction, but failed on an emotional level, something essential when trying to gain the audience's empathy."
" 'American History X' parody
",0.0,-0.6486,2020-12-26 00:00:00,2,"So imagine you went to see 'Scream' or 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' movie, but instead you got 'Scary Movie' series. This movie is parody of 'American History X'."
" Missed opportunity...
",-0.296,-0.9863,2020-05-21 00:00:00,6,"It is hard not to applaud Dan Radcliffe for trying to prove he is a versatile actor, and not just a cutie with a magic wand - but this isn't really it! His accent is very, very thin - as he portrays a young FBI agent infiltrating a gang of ruthless, murderous nazi supremacists. It isn't so much that Dan is rotten, it's the rest of the cast that are so stereotypically ridiculous that it leaves an huge implausibility gap with me. Sure, there are such groups in the US (and elsewhere, for that matter) but this portrays them as violent thugs without a brain cell between them; the latter part being more dangerous and less dramatic for the credentials of this adaptation of Michael German's equally black and white story. It lacks substance; relies on language and scare tactics to generate any sense of malevolence, and in the end I felt it focussed too much on the low hanging fruit, rather than really trying to get into the heads of these modern day gangsters."
" Really Good Performances And Very Tense, But The Writing Lets It Down Massively
",0.0644,-0.9868,2020-05-18 00:00:00,5,"Pros:
1. The score brilliantly lathers the film in a constantly tense and nerve-wracking feel.
2. The movie provides a fair enough representation of white power views which serves to heighten Nate Foster's (Daniel Radcliffe) ideological struggles and make them feel more real.
3. Daniel Radcliffe, Toni Collette (Angela Zamparo), Chris Sullivan (Andrew Blackwell), and Seth Numrich (Roy) give brilliant performances.
4. The tension and suspense are built up really well and it keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat for the entire duration.Cons:
1. In the beginning, Nate Foster strangely claims that Usman (Roger Yawson) did nothing but talk about taking action, even though he brazenly admitted to supplying materials for bomb-making, and he even went to detonate said bomb.
2. The film promulgates the false narrative that white supremacists commit more terror attacks than Muslims. The FBI has explicitly highlighted that it is the other way round.
3. Daniel Radcliffe's American accent is rather patchy in places, and at times sounds a little forced.
4. The fissures between the white power cells is introduced, and then forgotten about. The movie never truly examines these tensions.
5. The third act is completely rushed, as it tries to introduce a veritable bomb threat within the last 25 minutes with very little build up."
" Great to watch
",0.6249,0.4926,2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,It is a good movie to watch and you can see Daniel Radcliffe acting amazingly in my opinion!
" Good, just a bit hard to believe
",0.3612,0.9888,2020-05-11 00:00:00,7,"Imperium stars Daniel Radcliffe as FBI agent Nate Foster with a talent for relating to people but works as a keep-to-himself type agent, preferring to spend his nights reading a book or listening to classical music alone in his home rather than going out.He catches the eye of and agent Zamparo (Toni Collette) who thinks that a recent theft of cesium might have ties to a white supremacist group. She wants him to infiltrate the group, specifically to a speaker named Dallas Wolf, who she thinks may be using the cesium for a dirty bomb, or something like that.Armed with a couple of conversations and his apparently thorough reading of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", he joins a fringe white supremacist group and, by events and just his winning the hearts and minds of these people, ends up climbing the ranks and gaining the trust of the high level people in the group.(spoilers below)
One of the people he meets is Gerry Conway, a cerebral white supremacist that doesn't fit the usual stereotype, but because they like classical music, they become close. Turns out that Dallas Wolf is not the one with the cesium, which temporarily blindsides Foster and Zamparo, thinking all their infiltration work was a failure, only to realize it was Conway all along. Add in some suspenseful scenes at the end and it all finally works outDaniel Radcliffe was great in the movie. Yes, he may not look too intimidating, but I don't think that's necessarily a flaw.As he said, the one ingredient to facism is victimhood and he could have fit the bill of someone who was a victim all his life until he found this group. So I don't fault the movie for that.There were alot of tense scenes. One in particular where he's riding a truck with a white supremacist guy and the guy is talking about infiltrators in the group. I had the TV on just for some noise, but that scene captured me and I ended up recording it so I can watch it in full later on.So, the movie is well acted and well paced, but just hard to believe. Nate Foster is a timid, cerebral guy. Why he would choose such a dangerous mission seems out of place. Yes, he *wants* to do that, but given what he has actually *done*, it's not a *want* but a *wish*. And, just handing someone a book doesn't make them an expert. I can read about swimming, but it doesn't mean I can swim. It takes time, experimentation, failure. But Nate was automatically good, and surprisingly good on his feet, thinking of really good excuses in a tense situation. It just felt a bit hard to believe.Ultimately though, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit and glad I ended up watching it."
" Nothing special.
",-0.3089,0.9476,2020-05-09 00:00:00,6,"The fact that this is supposedly based on true events makes this an interesting movie to watch. However, as a thriller, there is nothing that could make it stand out from others. Although it is not a very bad movie, in a world where top quality TV thrillers like ""Narcos"", ""Homeland"" have raised the bar this movie looks pretty average. Other issue I noticed is that the White supremacists on this movie appeared as a bunch of amateurs who did not have a clue about most of the things including handling explosives. As a result, the treat posed by them did not seem serious."
" An Underrated Gem!
",0.0,0.8779,2020-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Rating: 8Radcliffe has a knack for indie movies and he always outshines in his performance. It is a bold move to take up political movies.The Good - Acting, Storyline and the cinematography. Toni Collette and Daniel Radcliffe bring out an amazing thriller. I like how they not only portray how the world sees Neo-Nazis but also the worldview of an *educated* one. If the movie were released at this time, there would be an immense positive reaction for it. It is a movie that should be in the spotlight to outcast these hate-groups and even eradicate them.The Bad - The ending was in a rush, however that does not mean it fell through. The general tone in the movie is at a medium pace in comparison to that I felt the ending was fast.Nonetheless, I would recommend this movie as a must-watch thriller which takes on the themes of organized hate-groups."
" Enjoyable but not memorable
",0.2382,0.7684,2020-03-26 00:00:00,5,"Radcliffe is good, story is interesting and the movie is watchable. But the characterization of the characters is elementary, and the film adds nothing to what we already know about this topic. Enjoyable, nothing more and nothing less."
" It didn't work for me as a good thriller
",0.5106,0.9287,2020-03-08 00:00:00,3,"With the topic this movie touches it could be so much more.
Unfortunately this story doesn't work at all.
The characters talk and behaves like a cartoons speaking wikipedia slogans every time they open their mouths.
The protagonist played by Daniel Radcliffe is never in real danger, we know from the start that he will be fine.
And the big plot twist, excuse me but I smelled it the first time ""family man"" showed up on screen.
Also, the acting (except pretty good performance from Radcliffe) is very stiff all around.
Sorry but you had something and you didn't executed it very well."
" Scary as Hell!
",-0.8439,-0.8195,2020-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Suspenseful and scary as hell, this film is pulse-pounding. That human beings can actually think like this never fails to shock me, and yet I went through Mauthausen concentration camp in 1970 when I lived in Austria. That these men quoted Invictus near the end I found absolutely horrifying, but what Toni Collete's character tells Daniel Radcliffe's at the end is even worse."
" Not bad
",0.431,0.6366,2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,Not nearly as good as American History X but the overall story is fine. Plenty of plot holes but I liked watching.
" Lazily written biased garbage.
",-0.2732,-0.0672,2020-02-10 00:00:00,4,I had really high hopes for this film being a big fan of American History X and daniel radcliffe but it's hard to see past the obvious liberal bias of the writers. It's clear to see that this is written by people out of touch with reality and have no clue about the subject matter and only deal in stereotypes. The Austin Wolf character is clearly meant to be Alex Jones. The actors did well with what they were given but it's hard to take the film seriously when you keep seeing things every couple of minutes that are just lazy stereotypes and make no sense.

The storyline is promising, actors not at all bad, but a movie is mad or broken by the way the story is told.Excruciating dialogues, very transparant ""plot twist"" , and not a single time I felt the main character was in danger, the efforts of the director notwithstanding. Mr. Ragussus should consider a career change, and if you really want to watch something worthwhile about white supremacy, watch 'The best of enemies', also available on Netflix."

Radcliffe is trying to give his best and everything looks professional but the script just sucks. It really sucks. It's very formulaic and every single character is a stereotype taken from a manual: the skinhead thug, the cultured and likeable but clinically insane guy, the strong female lead... boring"

The acting is good and the script is solid. I'd say a 7.5 out of 10, but will round up half a point to screw all those closeted white fascists giving the movie has votes because of their ignorance and bigotry."

" Tedious And Drawn Out Snoozefest
",0.0,-0.7787,2019-07-01 00:00:00,4,"ImperiumThis movie sought to explore the nature of extremism in America in reaction to the perceived onslaught of racially inspired terrorism. The premise tried to establish that nationalism was just as big a threat to world order as was jihad.Daniel Radcliffe fully committed to the stereotype of the disenfranchised nerd infiltrating a group young men trying to incite a race war. The problem was it was all so tame, a skinhead haircut, using the ""N"" word, having a tattoo, listening to punk music and drinking a Budweiser just doesn't cut it.BlackKKlansmen covered this subject matter in a very similar way and seemed less contrived.A common element of white supremacist is less everything, less travelled, less sophisticated, less mature, less articulate and less integrated into society.On the whole this movie was just tedious and drawn out, nothing happened and we just had an array of simple stereotypes. 4/10"
" Not so bad. Kind of enjoyed it.
",0.7481,0.9628,2019-05-19 00:00:00,8,"Imperium is also something different film of Daniel Radcliffe. I mean most of the time, I saw him in the Harry Potter films and when I saw him in this film, I feel he's totally a different man, different like a gangster. 😂 But it's kind of nice actually.This film is kind of a good one too. Although I don't quite understand some scenes, but it still makes the film good. The performances are also quite good, and sometimes, it gives you some excitements. So, I'd say it's very good to enjoy no matter how people are saying this is a bad film because we all have different tastes, different views and opinions."
" Imperium nearly successfully infiltrates the ideologies of white supremacists.
",0.296,-0.6588,2019-03-15 00:00:00,6,"'American History X' will always be the imperative film involving neo-Nazis and nationalism. No film has come close. Here we have a standard crime thriller that utilises its ""infiltrator"" plot structure to explore the perspective of white supremacists. Occasionally offering an insightful perspective into the radicalism that drives these fanatics, although frequently succumbing to a predictable story that lacks tension and thrills. An FBI agent is recruited to infiltrate an underground movement of radical neo-Nazis in order to investigate their next plan before they attack.Supremacy is viewed to be the catalyst for terrorism, violent outbursts of racial abuse opens a profound window into this fanatical movement. This film grants us with an intriguing look at the structure of underground groups like these (considering this is based on true events) and their perspective on society. Yes, it is a derivative of anti-semitism to which should be widely disregarded. Unfortunately though, these groups do still exist, making this story both timely and harrowing. Ragussis did an excellent job and conveying the passionate hatred that drives these individuals, as they chase for the Aryan future that their infamous idol failed to achieve. Despite a promising first half, the infrequent thrills and lack of characterisation for the protagonist ultimately left me wanting more. Radcliffe substitutes a wand for a hand gun and throws himself into this daring role. He perfectly suited the character. Collette by his side supporting him well, with a few fiery scenes between them.Alas, the mass amount of descriptions for the neo-Nazis' beliefs and absence of characterisation meant that it felt more educational than dramatic. Ragussis inventively injects still montages of white supremacy, but does nothing new with the base material. Concluding the film in the simplest way possible, almost diminishing the impact of its story. Still, Radcliffe's riveting central performance is enough to engage audiences, but stumbles badly on the last act."
" Great movie.
",0.6249,0.8508,2019-01-08 00:00:00,7,I don't know why Radcliffe gets so much beef. I though this role was amazing. Movie kept me thoroughly involved and entertained me throughout. Radcliffe was the glue holding the movie together. I don't know the inner workings of the bureau or skinhead groups to check for accuracy but I really enjoyed the movie.

" The defending of a nation
",0.0,0.998,2018-08-25 00:00:00,6,"'Imperium's' main interest point is the subject matter, it's an important and relevant one, very hard-hitting and portraying it takes a lot of courage with the danger of heavy-handedness or bias. Toni Collette is a fine actress, have liked to loved a lot of her performances, and wanted to see how Daniel Radcliffe would fare in one of his most mature and most challenging roles.Found 'Imperium' to be a worthwhile and interesting film but also an uneven one where potential is not completely fulfilled. Credit is due for taking on a difficult subject, which is not an easy thing to do, based on the real life experiences of Michael German, a real life FBI-agent, and there are many things to admire. With more focus and tightness 'Imperium' would have been an even better film, with much potential to be a very good even with many good things it is frustrating that the film for me was just decent.Lets start with the positive. The look of the film is slick, stylish and suitably gritty, a perfect visual approach for the story. The soundtrack has pulsating energy yet is dynamic enough, the use of Brahms is inspired and will delight classic music fans (like me). Despite the director actually being inexperienced making a film, this is actually quite a confident directing job.The script has tension and tautness, providing a good deal of thought and insight, while the story generally grips and has a suspenseful and bold feel to it, it's coherent too. Not everybody is going to like Daniel Radcliffe's performance, for me it's a strong contender for his best and shows how far he's grown as an actor. Fair play to him challenging himself. The cast generally did well, Tracy Letts being a standout.Expected much more from Collette though, her character was not very interesting and gave her little to do and Collette comes over as uncharacteristically bland. Her chemistry with Radcliffe has some spark, too far and between, but the tension between Radcliffe and the supremists was far more convincing.Did think that despite nothing being done disastrously a few elements were unevenly done. The script also can be heavy-handed and could have explored the subject in more depth at times, despite good intentions, and the story has some padding not always needed, a sometimes jumpy structure and plausibility can go out the window. The ending felt rushed and anti-climactic.Concluding, interesting if uneven. Well done for trying. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

Wrong casting for Daniel. Next time try playing a wedding planner or a dress designer."
" Nice to see Radcliffe maturing...
",0.4215,0.7662,2018-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Didn't have real high hopes going into this movie. I mean, after American History X, can another movie really capitalize on racism, violence, and consequence? Apparently so, as this movie was well made and acted. Radcliffe pushes as hard as he can at the few leads he has, almost to the point you think he's bound to get shot at any moment. As the investigation closes we are left with some stereotypical, mainstream movie scripting. This film doesn't really do anything unique but it's nice to see Daniel branching out into unknown waters and it's definitely worth your time."
" Good Conspiracy Thriller
",-0.0258,-0.6482,2018-07-11 00:00:00,8,"Imperium: Daniel Radcliffe is an FBI analyst with no field experience who is persuaded by senior agent Toni Collette to infiltrate the White Separatist movement after barrels of caesium go missing. Starting with skinheads he delves further and deeper into the white Power circles seeing their disagreements over dogma, how they flock around a low rent Alex Jones type. The disparate groups unite for a march and during a confrontation at this demo, Radcliffe rescues the leader of the Aryan alliance from attackers getting an in to the apparently more serious groups.Good Conspiracy/Thriller, Radcliffe is convincing, like Clark Kent he just has to take off his glasses to change from bookish analyst to Aryan Ubermensch. Collette is the driven cynical agent who is prepared to risk an inexperienced analyst on a deep cover mission but quite able to justify it to herself. We see scenes of a wedding taking place in front of burning swastikas and crosses, the penny ante Alex Jones is shown to be a conman: I don't believe in ZOG, I just tell these asses what they want to hear: I'm a Showman. The sense of threat that Radcliffe is constantly under is portrayed through dark filters indoors and washed out colours in forests. The plot has many twists and turns but the screenplay by director Daniel Ragussis delivers a coherent narrative. An impressive directorial debut by Ragussis. 8/10."

So very authentic and Radcliffe's acting in several moments I thought he was caught for sure, was so damn good. Keeping his wits and not panicking, while coming up with surprising reasons, or stories. His acting was good at least compared to his other garbage I've watched, since he became a man, and post Harry Potter. I just wished it had more violence, but not all true stories do, and the director definitely led on that there would be violence. As for being a true story, it was definitely worth watching, and for all the people giving it anything below a five is ridiculous, I guess you don't know what a good movie is, and plus it's 1h 48 min out of your oh so important lives... cmon.

I'm no way shape or form a fan of Daniel Radcliffe by any means, his movies have been garbage the few I've seen. In this role, I think he killed it as far as his undercover work. The script was good, just wish there had been more action in it. The reason I gave it such a higher rating is because the validity of the movie. Just like another guy said on his review the director knows all about white supremacy and the facts surrounding the movie are in fact real, even the stuff shown in the beginning are real. So great movie, but no way is it even comparable to American History X"

",0.0,0.9836,2018-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story is very intriguing and had many high points. Imperium does a great job at putting us into the world of supremacists and fascists.The acting overall is okay. Daniel Radcliffe delivers some dry lines but is the best part of the film. Sam Trammell gives a good performance as a well read, smart and intelligent man. Toni Collette and Tracy Letts give the worst performances.

The runtime is neither too long or too short which is great.The editing in this film is at times a little wacky.

" Surprisingly mediocre
",0.296,-0.3759,2018-01-15 00:00:00,2,"This film deals with a very pertinent and rabidly current subject matter, at a time when populist nationalism appears to be in vogue in American politics like never before. It features good actors, has an interesting soundtrack and a reasonable budget. And yet, in spite of these promising prospects, the result could not be more disappointing.Daniel Radcliffe seems like a fish out of water, awkwardly struggling with what should be easy acting material and proving that casting him was not an interesting, if unorthodox choice, but a mistake altogether. Not only does he look like the unlikeliest of skinheads, or FBI agents for that matter (with his small, fragile frame and his nervous demeanor), but his acting is insecure and lazy, and his chemistry with Toni Colette is next to nonexistent. The handling of the subject itself is half-baked, simplistic and full of clichés. It ticks all the requisite boxes that it deems necessary, but it does so with disciplined half-heartedness, almost as if it were a moral obligation and little else. A minority of white supremacists are intelligent enough to have a higher education and (partly) blend in with a ""civilized"" mainstream? Check. Fascism is fueled to a large extent by inferiority complex? Check. Radio hosts, preachers, soapbox populists and other manufacturers of consent are usually media-savvy narcissists who don't truly believe their own hogwash? Check. Nothing new.Character development is haphazard and leads to awkward situations. A few characters are (rightly) suspicious of the protagonist's motives, only to discard said suspicions with equal celerity, for no apparent reason. Said protagonist's unexpected friendship with one of the supporting characters could be an interesting plot development in theory, but its treatment in practice is wholly inadequate, overdeveloped and at times, strangely, borderline homoerotic--which is not good or bad in itself, but is probably far removed from the screenwriter's original intention.This is not a good film. It lacks intelligence and cynicism and it barks without a bite. Absolutely uninspired from every point of view. A film with this subject matter can never have a happy ending and expect to be taken seriously."

Most of them came across as good guys genuinely fighting for their country and their race and who can fault them for that.

The FBI is trying to track down some canisters of radioactive material before the white nationalists use the stuff in a bomb.

Nate meets with various characters and goes down several roads. The film goes into some of the details of the various theories associated with the movement and the differences within the group. The title of the film comes from a book. ""The Turner Diaries"" is cited as a way to eliminate ""mud people"" by creating an incident for the people to rally around.The film was interesting and keeps you engaged. However the technical aspect about Cs-137 was a laugh and they apparently had no guidance and less than Wikipedia knowledge on the topic.1) The amount of material that they had, they could have used a drone to detect it. 2) People in a vicinity would have had fatal radiation sickness as well as those who handled it because... 3) The script writer did not know the difference between radiation and contamination. 4) The small can provides very little shielding, it was immaterial to their exposure. Cesium 137 emits penetrating gamma radiation. 5) The level A suits they wore provides no protection from radiation and the ones they use had no breathing air, rendering the hoods useless. 6) Had they simply changed the isotope to say Strontium-90, a high energy beta emitter and bone seeker, then their actions would have made some sort of sense.

" Though far from impervious, Imperium is about able to pack a white-power punch.
",0.0,-0.9711,2017-07-29 00:00:00,6,"Politics in the United States of America beyond the right of the Republican Party is a fairly murky pool – it seems you do not have to journey too far for too long before you at least arrive at a very basic form of fascism. ""Imperium"" is a film which dares to depict these circles – the ones you end up venturing into when you plough through the barriers of what might constitute plain-old-regular conservatism: when you've passed the place on the spectrum occupied by people possessing an allergy to abortion; a love of the Christian God and a good rifle collection and arrived at straw swastikas; Confederate flags; Nazi salutes and One World Government conspiracy theories.I think this is ultimately down to the fact there is no such thing as American 'nationalism', so one does not need to go too far beyond the constraints of standard Roman Catholic/Christian/Mormon inflected right-of-centre conservatism (epitomised, perhaps, by George W. Bush or Mitt Romney in America in recent years) before one hits the brick wall of out-and-out hatred. This derives from two things: America, unlike European and Asian nations, lacks a physical national identity - an accepted national dress code; a national cuisine; a common language or religion. It opts, instead, for metaphysical things to determine its identity - things such as a love of freedom or faith in democracy. The point being that one can be of any racial denomination and from anywhere to share these beliefs.Secondly, the USA never had to stare down the armies of Hitler in the way Britain did, nor suffer occupation like the French; the Dutch and everyone else had to. Because there was no direct Nazi threat to them in the 1940's, Americans appear less sceptical to picking up the torch of Hitler's ideology and running with when compared to Europeans. There are plenty of European politicians and parties who are accused of doing this, but a moment's thought should figure out that they often are not actually those types of people.As for the film itself, ""Imperium"" is a perfectly workable thriller, which cracks along at a satisfying pace and never over-complicates what it's trying to do so much that you become lost in a maze-like narrative. It is fairly televisual and plays out its dynamic of 'cops' vs. 'racists' in a standard heroes and villains manner.It is English actor Daniel Radcliffe, who is actually part Jewish and is on record as to having supported the British Labour Party, playing Nate Foster who leads the film - an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As a character, Foster appears shorter than the other agents in the bureau and a little geekier – he's bespectacled and listens to classical music. When he is given his brief in a local diner by the perpetually gum-chewing Agent Angela Zamparo (Toni Collette), he appears to have ordered a glass of wine rather than the standard beer or whisky. He is picked on at work and scorned for his ""pipsqueak, ivy league"" intellectualism. The film's overall arc in many ways is about Foster winning their respect.Zamparo's said brief is the suggestion that Foster go undercover in order to infiltrate a skinhead gang with ties to wider neo-fascist movements – this is in the wake of the bureau discovering chemicals frequently used in terrorist attacks that could only have come from Africa in a recent road-traffic accident. You can, meanwhile, literally hear the clunking as there is the suggestion the chemicals might not have anything to do with an Islamic Terror cell, but a White Supremacist one. An amusing aside derives from Foster's way into the group: a fake story based on serving in Iraq and becoming inherently disillusioned with the direction America is going. This is despite the fact it not being very long prior to this that Johnny Rebel was singing ""F... You"" to Osama bin Laden in the wake of 9/11 and banging the drum for war in the Middle East while he did it.It is to Daniel Ragussis' credit that he spins out a thriller as engaging as ""Imperium"" is, although it is not without its problems. The film is spearheaded not by any fantastic narrative or character study, but by a Daniel Radcliffe performance which demands credible fascist world outlooks on some occasions; inflexible fear on others and sheer terror at the worst of times as suspicions arise around him. Both actor and director combine well to convey the numerous dread-infused situations whereby Foster's otherwise liberal individual is forced to confront people most certainly not of his political persuasion under the pretence of solidarity. Similarly, the decision to unfold the film in such a way so that tremendous harm appears in the least likely of moments and vice-versa is incredibly satisfying. In spite of everything flimsy about the film, ""Imperium"" is worth catching up with."

" Good from far, far from good...
",0.4404,-0.9931,2017-06-14 00:00:00,1,I went in with high hopes with the plot sounding very interesting but I was very let down. First the movie starts with showing a couple FBI agents acting unprofessional and throwing something at him to get his attention when he has headphones on. It then cuts to a scene where the FBI is saying they found some potential WMD material and there is still multiple amounts unaccounted for. They strongly imply that Islamist's have it for some reason because it's from Africa. Then of course it cuts to a female FBI agent schooling all the FBI agents on where the last WMD material was found. I found this as another movie just trying to make a bunch of guys look dumb and a woman leading the way with logic. Then the next scene cuts to her going to Radcliffe's character and showing him a video basically of a white supremacist admitting he has knowledge of the accident that was stated to be not shared by the media. He obviously would become the number one suspect for the entire FBI not just this woman and a rookie FBI agent. They make the FBI look like a bunch of Islamophobic idiots of course everyone except the lone women in the briefing... Daniel Radcliffe's then assumes this horrible backstory where he says he was a marine but it's quite obvious he's not built or carries himself like a soldier. Apparently all you need to do is shave your head and watch a few YouTube videos and your all set for a deep undercover op. They go-to their superior and of course he thinks it's so dumb and he doesn't believe it's worth it when the obvious video of a white supremacist leader talking about privileged information. The whole thing is so plain and lame it's incredibly obvious he isn't a soldier or a white supremacist. He's wearing Levi's which is apparently a no no cause Jews own them but then gives a back story no joke that his brother gave him jeans and as a gift lol. He instantly gets into the upper circles of the group which is really lame cause these groups would obviously be extremely tight nit and they would have grew up together. They also visit him at his apartment which is completely bare without a single sign of fascist ideology. Not a single thing the guy owns has a swastika on it. His tattoos are way to bright to be not recent. I'm guessing it's just airbrush for the movie but they could have made them look more natural. Then it comes to the protest against antifa. Antifa is shown in a very positive light which is concerning because they are usually the first people to go-to violence yell mindless chants and have the hammer and sickle of the communist USSR which is just as bad as a swastika. Overall the movie seems like a horrible attempt at a thriller there no genuine sense of anxiety of being a undercover he does a terrible job to begin with. I do believe Radcliffe's gives a decent performance but the script and plot is terrible. The movie isn't very believable and I'm had a hard time not watching something else. It's extremely far fetched and depicts organizations incorrectly. I'm actually getting frustrated watching it as I really expected something with the same power of American history x or Russell crowes white supremacist movie. If I was one of these guys you bet my ass I'd be able to figure it out. This feels politically motivated picture with a liberal bias as well. They should have done some more research on. The FBI and these organizations cause they feel very rinky dink and cheesy. There's no strong personality's really whatsoever. I can usually find one good thing about a picture but I can't think of a single one. I'd rather watch a kids cartoon.
" trying to break that Harry Potter mode
",0.0,-0.1111,2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"Daniel Radcliffe is working hard in his career to take on some interesting, off-type roles. Here he plays an FBI agent who goes undercover as a white supremacist at the encouragement of another agent, played by Toni Collette.Radcliffe only partially succeeds as he is an atypical White Supremacist, just as this is an atypical role for him. White Supremacists are fanatics; they are angry and vicious people as well. As Nate Foster, Radcliffe comes off as a curious young guy toying with the idea of hating everyone.The film reminded me of The Infiltrator with Bryan Cranston, in that Nate forms a relationship with someone on the inside. In Nate's case, it's Sam (Gerry Conway), a seemingly nice guy with a family and a love of classical music, and Nate just doesn't get his commitment and struggles with it. There are scary and dramatic scenes, and Radcliffe has one thing no one can take from him - he's likable and makes you care not just for him but the operation as well.Good, not great. Radcliffe needs to continue seeking roles that challenge him but at the same time, he needs to stretch his acting chops."

Disgusting and predictable tripe. Not to mention the story is just plain dumb. When they make the arrest he blows his cover right away. The acting is absurd, including Toni Collette's extremely annoying gum chewing and stupid facial expressions. The only victims are the idiots that watch and believe this pile of trash.

But it's still nicely told with a pace that may not suit everyone, because it's not fast paced and tries to stay as grounded to reality as possible. While characters in the film are not described as people in the real life, I'm pretty sure you'll guess one or two inspirations from ""news"" programs.So this is actually balanced and truly fair in its depictions, without promoting that notion and not delivering. Again, this is a thriller and it is about the performances and they are exceptional. Daniel Radcliffe has grown up to become something else than a wizard. He's showing that he's able to do more.

" Not horrible, not the best
",-0.1326,0.8481,2017-05-03 00:00:00,6,"So the story line starts strong, but then drifts into itself to much almost. And the ending is very anti-climactic. That being said, its not horrible. Starts with a straightedge, self involved daniel radcliffe showing his intelligence and great use of understanding. Then it gives a small amount of backstory for him and his being. And then thrusts into him getting a undercover position for a white supremacist radical group bc a boss at the agency (toni c.) suggest they stole illegal chemicals. Once this happens he almost immediately becomes one of them, begins moving along the ranks and meeting others. At one point he meets other radical groups who don't get along with his current homies and ask him to visit them instead. As the movie progresses he of course does to ""move up"". Leaving his first neo Nazi group, hes pushing the ""main bad guy"" for answers only to find out its not him, major plot twist. Then the movie reveals its a different person you didn't suspect and that hes been calling the shots all along. Daniel then joins him, again leaving neo Nazi group for another in a way, finds out where everything is, is about to help them set everything off and then the bad guy goes oh duh Daniel's not really one of us, and before anything can happen the FBI is there to stop them and that's it. All in all, the middle act is drawn out and misses a lot. Many questions you can ask and never get an answer to. The ending, for me, ruins it all. I don't need the bomb to go off, but something more than a spill of laundry soap and throw to the grown would be nice. I commend daniel, he tried and it wasn't his best film, but he is doing his best to get away from potter. Its a worth effort. Toni Colette is OK, a bit dry but she does whats needed. Truly the best thing is the attention to detail in conversation about neo Nazism and white supremacist. The director got many facts and articles correct and really pushed that. Aside from that, if its at red box, maybe spend the $2 or you can wait for TV."

Unfortunately the theme of this film is based on true incidents as written by Michael German with Daniel Ragussis who also directs. It is a magnifying glass held up to the many organizations of racists who believe that all non- Caucasian people should be destroyed – the white supremacists, be they KKK, or any other of the many hate groups whose influence is being more intensely felt during these times. It is a difficult movie to watch but at the same time perhaps it is a film that more people should see to be aware of a threat to equality that abounds, especially since January 2017!Idealistic FBI agent Nate Foster (Daniel Radcliffe) goes undercover to take down a radical white supremacy terrorist group.

" A Daniel Radcliffe show that is taut, thrilling and insightful
",0.4767,-0.8106,2017-04-15 00:00:00,7,"A smart honest rookie cop goes undercover, broken to the edge and survives, sympathizes with the gang and eventually rises above the dilemma and does the right thing. Each of us has come across at least one movie with a similar storyline. What makes the writers, directors and film makers revisit this theme that has been told over and over? Going away from the glamorous and over-the-top Bond or Ethan Hunt style spy movies, the closest you would come across in terms of reality are these undercover thrillers. If they are done well, there is an immediate connect with the audience, they root for the protagonist, they empathize with the emotions leading to repetitive views and healthy box office collections. Movies based on white supremacist antagonists in Hollywood are not common. While they come sporadically, featuring mainstream actors is rarer like American History X, A Time to Kill etc. Nate Foster (Daniel Radcliffe) is a loner but highly intellectual FBI agent eager to make a mark. An imminent threat alert drives the department over the edge to investigate and identify the source of the threat and the entire department directs their focus on radical Islamic terrorism. When officer Angela (Toni Collette) suggests a possibility of domestic terrorism involving right wing fascist groups, her superiors and peers ridicules her except Nate. Angela manages to convince her boss and requests for Nate to go undercover as she has seen him before on how he could connect with suspects and get them to talk. Using her years of undercover experience, she gives a crash course to Nate on how he could infiltrate a potential fascist group which can lead him to connect with the nationwide leader who provokes through fascism Dallas Wolf (Tracy Letts). Having not followed Daniel Radcliffe's filmography except for the initial Harry Potter movies, I had nothing to expect of his performance or his script choices. But definitely looks like he has come a long way. There are moments in the movie which doesn't quite add up - some of them plainly contrived while others loosely written, but Radcliffe shoulders the burden of patching them up and even turns some of them into gripping, gritty and soulful sequences. The supporting cast gives good performances as well if we ignore some clichéd characters here and there. There are 2 important points of note that transcends to real world on how radicalization occurs - a charismatic leader delivering an irresponsible speech not knowing the consequences, brainwashing the children at a very tender age before they could understand and decide for themselves.Going to the technical departments, the runtime is crisp with the screenplay and editing departments that knows where to indulge and where to be brief. The background score is an asset to the movie that varies by the mood and at times even sets it up. While it has its overwhelming positives, it is not a smooth road always especially towards the end when Radcliffe's character attempts to convince too many people. Also the character Gerry Conway played by Sam Trammell has a sudden change to the character arc where he goes from a loving family man, a rational thinker but with a fascist mindset to a downright radical ready to give up his life in a spur of the moment. However there are enough elements to keep the audience at the edge of their seats leading up to the suspenseful climax even if one could guess how it might end from a mile away. A Daniel Radcliffe show that is taut, thrilling and insightful."

",0.1531,0.994,2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"Within the first few shots of 'Imperium' I already knew what its biggest problem was going to be. Daniel Radcliffe is cancer to a film. The fact that 'Imperium' was probably his strongest performance to date, and yet he was still so distractingly bad that it nearly managed to derail the entire film should say more than enough. At least when he is doing things like 'Harry Potter' or 'The Woman in Black' he isn't ruining anything that would otherwise be good. Here though, there was the potential to spoil what was otherwise an incredibly strong film. Luckily though, it was strong enough to withstand his horrible performance.The movie itself is a very fun ride. It's based on a true story, but that never weighs the plot down into the realm of being ""too realistic"", as some true stories tend to come across. Every scene manages to hold a tremendous amount of tension and the story is written very cleverly, always keeping the audience on edge about how much certain characters actually know or suspect. The pacing is also excellent and ensures the film never drags.There are a lot of actors in Hollywood who could have done this role real justice. Radcliffe was not one of them. The fact that the film survives his performance and remains very watchable and enjoyable speaks volumes. If you happen to be a Radcliffe fan you are going to absolutely love this film. If you're like me and you're not, there's still a very good chance you'll enjoy your experience."

The film is a straightforward account of an Arabic speaking agent who makes his suspects feel at ease but really not going anywhere in the bureau.Toni Collette is the supervisor who persuades him to infiltrate neo-nazi groups even though he has no training for deep undercover work. All he has to do is shave off his head and read Dale Carnegie's 'How to win friends and influence people.'Like Costa-Gavras 1988 film 'Betrayed' the film tries to show a more human side to these supremacists although you also see the jerks as well. Some are family men, many see themselves as victims socially, economically or both. Unlike 'Betrayed' there is no tacked on love story.There is a memorable scene by Tracy Letts who plays right wing radio shock jock Dallas Wolf, who admits he does not believe in this white supremacist, conspiracy nonsense, he just wants to make money and say things that his audience just laps up.Radcliffe has the wide eyed innocence of an agent who is in over his head.

" Worse Than The Sum Of Its Parts.
",-0.4767,-0.9906,2017-03-04 00:00:00,5,"There's a lot to like about Imperium, on paper. Daniel Radcliffe is a solid actor and has made interesting choices as he skillfully dug his way out from under the Harry Potter franchise. The subject matter, meanwhile, is timely and interesting. Unfortunately, Imperium is frustratingly heavy-handed, putting little effort into characterisation and frequently patronising viewers. Radcliffe plays a geeky, intellectual FBI agent. We know he's geeky and intellectual because he wears glasses and listens to classical music.Despite an opening scene in which we learn that Radcliffe's character can speak fluent Arabic, the FBI decides that they apparently can't find a practical use for such an agent and so he's sent off to infiltrate neo-Nazis by by Toni Collette, whose character traits include ""chewing gum"" and ""being a woman.""These neo-Nazis are fairly one-dimensional, and any of the deeper psychology or motivation behind their characters is largely ignored, but this is typical of a film that is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. Or maybe it's just that this is a film that thinks the audience is stupid. We see Radcliffe researching what a ""dirty bomb"" is, at one point, which raises the terrifying prospect that the average movie- goer is more knowledgeable about terrorism than an FBI agent - I already know what a dirty bomb is and I build shelves for a living.This sort of lazy plotting is rife in a film which, for all its promise, basically boils down to ""racism is bad."" It's a shame, but Imperium, whilst marginally entertaining is, overall, a missed opportunity."
" Based on true events.
",0.4215,0.7859,2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I remember when the trailer for this movie first hit YouTube. Nazi-trolls invaded the comment section hard, and now I can see why. This film is based on true events. The stupid marketing SHOULD have put that right in the trailer, ""Based on real life events."" Whatever, I'm not here to review the trailer, I'm here to review the film and I'm happy to report it is good. And educational. First off, the acting is great across the board. Daniel Radcliffe will never be Harry Potter or ""that kid who played Harry Potter"" or ""that actor who played Harry Potter."" In my mind's eye he has officially become just Daniel Radcliffe, if you watch this film you'll see why. Heck, the man can even do an American accent without sounding like he has a gear jammed down his throat. Tell that to Dr. Strange, Rick from Walking Dead and House MD. Anyway, Daniel Radcliffe did the impossible and escaped the kiddy typecast role curse; something Frodo from LoTRs has yet to do, but I digress. The film is paced well and more than interesting enough to hold your attention while showing you most of the moving parts to the modern day KKK. I think that is the real reason why there was so much backlash against the film. Personally, I love the film American History X but on some level it sort of glorifies the modern day Nazi movement in the eyes of some impressionable young individuals blinded by hate. This film does the opposite by showing the movement for what it is, mostly a cash grab playing off hate. I can go on and on with this review but I have other films to review. Oh, I did look into the true story aspect of this film and it is legit. To protect the good guys, the lead character Radcliffe plays isn't a real person but his experiences are real. Plus this film covers numerous other times the KKK committed domestic terrorist acts on US soil in modern years. Anyway, long story short this is an eight out of ten kind of film but I'm rounding up to ten to offset the rage haters."
" Just not credible enough to make for compelling viewing
",0.2263,0.9661,2017-02-02 00:00:00,5,"(previously published on joflo.ws/imper1um)British actor Daniel Radcliffe plays an FBI agent who goes undercover with white supremacists and for the most part he does a good job. It's just that his American accent occasionally slips and his short stature affects his credibility as his character's undercover alter ego. Clearly, this lack of credibility is only obvious to the viewer, because on screen, Radcliffe's character Nate has no trouble fitting in with various groups of neo-Nazis and appears to infiltrate with comfortable ease and at remarkable speed, deflecting any tension with wit and intelligence. Hopping from one racist clique to the next, Nate is always the smartest in a room full of white guys; he has an answer to every question and an explanation in response to any doubt raised. If it wasn't for all the other white blokes being so thick, no doubt his cover would have been blown faster than you can shout 'White Power.'Meanwhile, Radcliffe's Australian co-star Toni Collette's American accent is better than his, but her problem in this film is that she seems to parody rather than just play an FBI supervisor. In Wittertainment parlance, it's a performance turned up to eleventy stupid. The less said about it, the better.The most believable acting performance in Imperium comes courtesy of Tracy Letts. By the time we learn the truth about the radio presenter he plays in this film, I sincerely wonder how many broadcasters, columnists and other professional opinion-givers in the real world have built their careers on a similar earning model to that of the fictional Dallas Wolf. It makes sense. He makes sense. Letts' convincing performance is let down, however, by how poorly his part has been written into the plot; it's a storyline that might have worked better before internet radio and podcasting blurred state lines and country borders, but I'm not sure it stands up in 2016.Taking cues from American History X and The Firm —the one with Gary Oldman, not the one with Tom Cruise— only illustrates how good those films were and how not-very-good Imperium is. Moreover, unless my memory is deceiving me, there's one specific scene early on that I feel I've seen before, at the end of I.D.Daniel Radcliffe in Imperium (2016) Reece Dinsdale in I.D. (1995) What, if anything, did I learn from this film? Two things. Firstly, that going undercover doesn't require FBI training or experience; reading Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People should suffice. Secondly, once you pretend to be a white supremacist, you will no longer need your glasses; then, when you stop pretending to be a white supremacist, you will need your glasses again. (Mind you, with a frame as ill-fitting as Nate Foster's, I doubt glasses are of much use in the first place — he must have been peering at the rim more than through the actual lenses.)"
" A generally fine thriller that is genuinely dynamic
",0.5859,0.9375,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Morning * Monday Morning Frustrated at his seeming inability to land a good case, young FBI agent Nate Foster (Daniel Radcliffe) is approached by senior agent Angela Zamparo (Toni Collette) to infiltrate a white supremacist organisation she believes are responsible for some missing chemicals from a compound. He blends in well, and impresses some senior members in the group, including Gerry Conway (Sam Trammell), the charismatic leader, but as his mission wages on, he finds himself embroiled in departmental bureaucracy and deceit as Conway plots his grand plan.Having never gotten into the whole Harry Potter franchise, Daniel Radcliffe is one actor I never really followed that closely, but it was still a surprise to find him in this highly charged thriller, which plunges us back into the world of neo Nazi extremism. He doesn't fit the role perfectly, and you can never be sure whether it's because he's too geeky or too young, but that's not to say he gives a bad performance, and is a decent lead.Debut feature length director Daniel Ragussis has crafted what appears to be a modest budgeted production, but taken time to craft an intelligent, considered screenplay that takes pains to get under the skins of its far right characters and portray them as seriously flawed but vaguely humanistic and intelligent characters, rather than merely as one dimensional stereotypes. It comes off as a little film that seems to have some big ideas to share, eager to burst out of its small bubble.An intriguing and compelling first half is let down by an ending that descends into melodrama, and is sort of anti climatic, but it's generally dynamic and worthwhile. It disappeared from cinemas pretty quickly, which is all too much of a shame in this current climate, but it's well worth seeking out. ***"
" Undercover in the world of white supremacists idiots
",-0.25,-0.3989,2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Imperium might not be the best movie ever about a FBI agent going undercover but it is still worth a watch. There are for sure better movies with the same theme, maybe not about white supremacists, just other undercover work, but still it was entertaining. Daniel Radcliffe proves he can do other things then Harry Potter. It's not his best work though but it's still watchable. The story-line fits well in this time of all the hate towards other people. If it's Muslims extremists or white supremacists, it's basically the same. They all are for the vast majority really dumb and in Imperium it reflects it well. White supremacists are dangerous because they are actually so dumb. In Imperium you can follow the narrow minded hateful ideas they have. The movie might have been better with some more action but all in all it's an easy to watch movie."
