" It managed to scare me
",-0.4939,0.9515,2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"I'm a huge horror film fanatic and don't get scared that easily but this film left me hanging on the edge of my seat I loved it and was hugely surprised at the scribe it got, aside from one end shot i found it thrilling and just a really great film if you what to be scared, from disturbing scenes to scenes where your not quite sure what is going on this film has it all."
" Just Not a Good Movie
",-0.3412,0.9244,2021-03-03 00:00:00,3,"I love Natalie Dormer, but it certainly feels like her performance was wasted on this movie. The setting of the Aokigahara Forest would seem like it would be a great fit for some good scares and just general eeriness. But the movie is hopelessly boring, somewhat confusing, and the ending is cheap. I honestly don't know what I just watched. There was a lot of potential, but it just didn't do anything in the end."
" Long loooooong man!
",0.0,0.2747,2021-02-14 00:00:00,2,"Sudden craving for Sakeru Gummy...What kind of movie was this supposed to be?-I found the forest to be actually quite beautiful, aside from the sad reputation it has.
So even 'creepy' shots just look like some nature documentary.-The yurei are zombies for some reason *shrug-Culturally ignorant American scoffs at superstition, but brags about psychic connection with sister? Oookay~-Protagonist goes to a SUSHI restaurant and asks for cooked food. (Granted not all sushi is raw, but honestly...what are you expecting)-----------------
Movie gets 2 stars.
1 for the nature.
1 for Yukiyoshi Ozawa."
" Nothing good about this movie (Spoilers!)
",-0.4015,-0.9973,2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,"I saw that this movie had a low rating but I thought I would give it a chance because of the suicide forest. This subject looked interesting to me and I seemed like a good place for a horror movie. It was a reall mistake watching this movie. Nothing makes sense and it is really boring.The jump scares in this movie are so predictable and not scary at all. The main character Sara is really annoying and you feel zero sympathy for her. During the film she made really stupid choices and I started to be against her in this movie. Iknow Natalie Dormer can act really good but in this movie her acting is horrible.For some reason Sara her sister got lost during a field trip with her class and now Sara has to go get her because she can 'feel' that jess is still alive.Sara goes alone to Japan to the suicide forest. It is known to be a dangerous place and everybody warned her not to go off the path and to not go when you are sad. So you instantly know that Sara will see all sorts of things and will go insane during the runtime.She meets this guy in a bar who happens to go to the forest and she goes with him. It is clear since the beginning that she will die in het forest. They tried to make it a plot twist that Sara died, but even this is predictable. Jess somehow manages to survive 5 days in the forest after getting lost. At the end Jess can feel that Sara had died en her reaction was the worst. Your sister who came to rescue you just died en your reactions is ´o, Sara´and no tears at all.I would NOT recommend this movie at all. All it does is annoy you over how bad it is."
" GREAT psychological thriller! Watch it NOT expecting horror.
",0.8599,0.927,2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"I think this is my first review? This movie was great! No..... not a horror movie, but rather a psychological suspense thriller! Nice twist in the end that hems a the plot together. I was pleased having seen past the low-ish IMDB score and watched this movie!"
" Jump Scares: The Movie
",-0.34,-0.9674,2020-10-21 00:00:00,3,"Insulting to people who like horror movies:
This movie has two kinds of scary things happening: jump scares, and fake-out scares. It was intensely boring and predictable.Insulting to people who commit suicide:
Also, just to be clear, this forest is a real place in the real world. And it is where a lot of people go to commit suicide. This movie makes a joke out of all of those real people who killed themselves. At no point does it try to even pretend to give that real world material due respect."
" NEEDS Based on a true location
",0.4215,0.6718,2020-10-18 00:00:00,9,Okay! Why are you not shooting the films at Aokigahara forest? Why? the location not seems real one but the acting is kinda good.
" Worth One Watch
",0.2263,0.6249,2020-10-09 00:00:00,5,"It's been awhile since I saw this, so my memory of it is not impeccable. I do recall thinking Rotten Tomatoes was too rough on it, as it had some effective scares and an interesting connection to real life (I never even heard of Japan's suicide forest, and I like it when movies can teach me a new fact). That said, it certainly is no prized jewel among films. There is no need for a cinephile or casual film fan to make room in his/her schedule to see it."
" Formula Shock Horror
",-0.743,-0.875,2020-10-06 00:00:00,2,I found this movie to be standard shlock horror with demon face changes and green 'spooky' lighting. Even with the fast forward button that I used often this movie was brutally boring.

" Underwhelming
",0.0,0.6757,2020-07-28 00:00:00,6,"The ingredients are definitely there. an original story, a truly iconic landmark with a deep history and a rich cultural background. Beautiful landscape. But instead of paying tribute to Aokigahara and to the people who seek to go there the movie reduces it in my opinion to its pure location. I'm missing the actual tragedy, the emotional or even psychological aspect.
On top, I'm struggling with the arrogance the main character portrayed. There's no respect given to the history and spirit of this place...ultimately I experienced a movie which could have been an amazing tale but ended simply as mainstream entertainment."
" Typical scary movie with stupid decisions
",-0.765,0.4076,2020-07-07 00:00:00,3,Sara was just a weak idiot who was just straight gullible! Her logic made no sense! She believed in some magical connection with her twin but not angry ghosts that was told to her by everyone! But her logic in the forest was dumb! I mean some may like this movie but I didn't! I'm usually pretty easily entertained but this didn't do it for me!
" As good as a colonoscopy
",0.4404,-0.5859,2020-05-19 00:00:00,1,Do you enjoy muttering what the hell is going on over and over while watching cliche horror tropes?You'll love this movie.The only redeeming quality was that old as lady that kept appearing for no reason.1/10 watch this puppy for some perspective. It's good to know that even thou the pandemic is causing crushing depression to myself and the world that at least back in 2016 this director was feeling it as well.
" True tension and horror
",-0.4939,-0.7906,2020-05-14 00:00:00,6,"A twin goes to the suicide forest in Japan and doesn't come back out. Perhaps she didn't stay on the path as everyone is warned to do. Her sister goes in to find her...and this is where true tension and horror begin. On the day before she enters the forest she meets Aiden, an American journalist who introduces her to a guide for the Aokigahara Forest who searches for the missing on the side. This trio goes into the woods seeking the missing twin. I was in a twist almost from the moment we see Aiden staring at her tent while he lay outside by the fire. Loved it. Plus there were some true surprises."
" Enjoyable - Glad I Didn't Pay Attention to the Rating
",0.7348,0.8658,2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,"I was hesitant to watch the film with a 4.8 on IMDb. Glad I did anyway. It was creepy, atmospheric, and visually appealing with a great story. Excellent psychological thriller that makes you question reality often. Although not devoid of a few cheap jump scares, the acting was solid, plot moved well, and I was willing to forgive Natalie Dormer's bad approximation of an American accent. I'm fairly critical and I thought it was a good film - give it a shot."
" Huh???

" Unsatisfying
",0.0,-0.9936,2020-04-18 00:00:00,4,"I personally believe this to be the first bad movie I've ever seen(I take that back, transformers 5 was shameless and probably far worse than this film). Now don't get me wrong it's perfectly watchable and with its hour and a half run time it certainly doesn't overstay its welcome, but this does not make it a good film. Now before I get into the bad stuff I do like to mention the good first, so let's do that. First of all I found all of the leads interesting enough and have got to give props to the main actress for playing two people. I must also say that I thought it was a very interesting idea, and daresay it could have been a decent film in the right hands. But that's about where the good ends, now we gotta talk about the bad. For being a horror film it isn't really scary at any point that much. Whenever the movie tries to scare you it cheats and jump scares you instead of actually frightening you. And I have to talk about these jump scares because they are some of the cheapest I've ever seen. Basically, it'll start with the main character noticing something odd, preceding to investigate, we see a shot of their face, then BAM jump scare. The problem is the movie is trying to be subtle and complex and just keeps messing it up. And another thing to mention is the end, which up until this point the film had at least been able to seem serious, but then we are met with this seriously dumb ending where the main character dies, come back as a ghost, and in the last shot of the film, is chasing the other lead character. It's not like a scene like this couldn't possibly work, but the way it's executed is just jarring and very un-serious compared to the rest of the film. I can't really recommend this film unless you wanna learn about some Japanese lore, but even then just read about it, this just isn't worth it."

" Insulting movie that makes light of suicide
",-0.8271,-0.9817,2020-02-28 00:00:00,1,"Bad. Just bad all around. It's insulting to Japan, as others have mentioned, but also takes the very serious topics of familial mental illness and suicide and turns it into a farce. The actress in the lead role is terrible. She's unlikable from the start. If you want to watch a good movie about the ""suicide forest"", skip this and watch The Sea of Trees with Matthew McConaughey instead."
" Not that bad.
",0.431,0.9042,2020-02-26 00:00:00,9,"People are too negative on this film. I didn't think it was that bad. I mean everyone has their own opinions and likes but I say give it a chance. Has a good plot, twists, the ghosts were well made, graphics and makeup wise. Acting was spot on, it actually put you in their mind and made you feel what they're feeling. I'd watch it again."
" West-centered Garbage
",0.0,-0.7003,2020-02-24 00:00:00,1,"I am pained by how racist this movie is. The Japanese isn't even subtitled, it's just ""speaking Japanese"". Furthermore, the film treats Japan like some foolish, superstitious country and not a normal, first world nation. It does what so many movies do and treats anything non-white as weird and unworthy.Ultimately, the movie is bad all on its own, but that made it irredeemable for me."
" Americanized Garbage
",0.0,-0.8271,2020-02-22 00:00:00,1,They're in Japan but everyone the main character runs into speaks perfect English. On top of that the overall idea of exploiting peoples misery to make a film about the forest they kill themselves in seems rather distasteful and to a point almost stereotypical. Considering this is pretty much a film made for white audiences it just capitalizes on the stereotypes they already believe about Japanese people. The story is right up there with those ring movies no one remembers.
" Well worth watching
",0.4588,-0.2025,2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Good idea for a scary movie. I really liked the way the movie progressed, and we saw how the characters developed. The ending wasn't that great, very typical rushed scene without any resolution. As one sister was looking for her twin in the forest, I thought they would develop the plot and make her actually them both the same person with a dual personality. It had some scary scenes, the ending could have been better. I didn't understand what happened to Sarah."
" Good with room for improvement
",0.7096,0.9938,2020-02-17 00:00:00,7,"This movie was good but I feel there were some improvements that could have been made. The first Improvement that could be made is Sara's motive. The whole ""twin's intuition"" thing just feels insufficient. The motive could have been that Sara has try to contact Jess several times to no avail and that's why she is going to Aokigahara Forest. The second improvement is that the jump-scares could be cut way back. We don't need to be reminded that ghosts are scary. A majority of the payoff of classic horror movies is the atmosphere or ambience. Another improvement, going back to the beginning, is the abrupt beginning of the film. I feel like there should be a build up to Sarah's motive for going to Japan. Not that I expect this to be a good justification for why I think the film is good, but at least it's not found footage style. I realize the whole ""it could have been worse angle"" is not entirely convincing to most people. My point is there could have been some creative liberties taken that would definitely have made the film better. One creative liberty that I kind of like but felt they could have improved on was how the ghosts lingered in the background. The improvements that could be made are not relying on jump-scares as the payoff and being a bit more subtle about the ghosts' presence. Overall it's an interesting concept but there are some simple fixes that would have made the execution a bit better"
" Don't go in the Forest.
",0.0,-0.8708,2020-01-25 00:00:00,4,"I saw this film in the cinema with friends when it was first released and I remember it being relatively creepy and filled with jump-scares. It was one of the first horror films I'd seen in the cinema but I'd watched them previously so I was aware how cliché the film is. Me and my friends didn't really think much of it, we sort of just had a laugh with it and none of use really spoke of it afterwards. The plot of the film could've worked but it's handled like every other generic horror film.I rewatched the Forest recently and my god is this film forgettable. This truly is one of the most uninspired movies I've seen in a long time, some scenes are decent at building suspense but everything else is so flat and boring. Natalie Dormers performance is mediocre to laughably bad and the end scare of the film is awful, I couldn't recommend it but I know it'll be nostalgic in the future as being one of the first horror films I watched at the cinema."
" At least it was short

" Unintentional comedy and cringefest
",0.3612,-0.1272,2019-08-30 00:00:00,6,"It's unintentional comedy of a bumbling fool abroad, in a situation in which a bumbling fool doens't belong at all (The Sew-i-cide Forest obviously).The scene at the end is just belly-splittingly funny, I'm so sorry for the director who wanted to construct a ""creepy"" movie but built something which is in equal parts cringy - from the embarrassment by proxy from all of the socially-handicapped and Asperger-bordering-on-mentally-disabled protagonists - and unintentionally funny when those protagonists come in contact with normal people, nature, and d'uh - the Sew-i-cide Forrest."
" Just Give it a Shot
",0.0,0.9313,2019-07-24 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed watching The Forest - nice dark atmosphere, some thrilling moments and twists, nice cinematography and solid acting. No masterpiece but not nearly as bad as many bad reviews and the rather low rating indicates - underrated like In Darkness (2018, also starring Natalie Dormer)."
" Tree out of ten.
",0.0,-0.9434,2019-07-18 00:00:00,3,"Aokigahara is a dense forest on the northwestern flank of Mount Fuji infamous for being the third most popular place in the world to commit suicide. According to legend, the angry spirits (yurei) that haunt the woods prevent others who decide to visit the area from leaving and try to make them top themselves as well. It's the perfect location for a horror movie, remote, shadowy and cursed, so it comes as quite a disappointment that The Forest is yet another underwhelming contemporary horror movie light on logic and heavy on predictable jump scares.The plot sees a young American woman, Sara (Natalie Dormer) flying to Japan after her twin sister Jess (also played by Dormer) goes missing in Aokigahara. Convinced that her sister is still alive, Sara enters the forest, accompanied by reporter Aiden (Taylor Kinney), who wants to write an article about her story, and park ranger Michi (Yukiyoshi Ozawa). When they locate Jess's tent, Michi says it is time to leave, and that they can return the next morning, but Sara decides to stay the night, accompanied by Aiden. Then spooky stuff happens.The night spent in the tent is highly reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project, with strange noises in the woods and shadowy figures lurking outside; Sara becomes confused about which way she and Aiden are travelling through the forest; a creepy schoolgirl appears and disappears; there's paranoia, as Sara suspects that Aiden is keeping a secret; and let us not forget about those all-important mechanical scares, only one of which made me jump (the viewmaster scene - I guessed what was coming but it still got me). None of this is very inspired, content-wise or visually, director Jason Zada's handling of matters being just as clichéd as the script by Nick Antosca, Sarah Cornwell, Ben Ketai, which closes matters with a not-very-clever twist ending.3/10."

" A very mediocre horror experience...
",-0.6096,0.848,2019-06-24 00:00:00,5,"I didn't really know what to expect from ""The Forest"". I mean, an American horror movie set to take place in the Aokigahara forest, doesn't really scream of a horror movie classic in the making.But still, I decided to watch ""The Forest"", given that I had the chance to do so. And I must admit that director Jason Zada was good at building up the atmosphere in the movie. However, the material written by Nick Antosca, Sarah Cornwell and Ben Ketai just didn't really give director Jason Zada all that much to work with.The storyline was adequately entertaining, it ended up as mediocre though, because the movie was slow paced and frightfully devoid of anything even remotely scary - unless you perhaps are a twelve year old Japanese school girl.Natalie Dormer, playing the role of both Jess and Sara Price was actually doing a nice job with her roles, despite being severely limited by the script. The movie had a very small cast of actors and actresses, so there was even more pressure on those in the lead.I would have rated ""The Forest"" four out of ten stars, but given the nice turn of events towards the end of the movie, I am settling on a mediocre five out of ten stars. The part leading up to the ending was actually quite good, but it was ultimately not enough to lift up the rest of the movie."

Because she loses her mind, (not a spoiler) this seemed like an excuse for the directors to just do whatever they want which massively hindered the plot.
Last 30 minutes was just pointless, you knew what was coming and again, annoying.
Took ages to actually get going.Only real compliment I can give is that I was intrigued and kept in suspense up until the last half an hour until it unfolded badly.To be honest I don't reall reccommend"
" Very meh

Also Aidan got done dirty he saved her life from inside that tunnel and she kills him.

This movie is quite good imo. They kinda did a good job. Kinda is because of the ending. Feels like they needed to add the twist or surprise and they forced it at the end.
All they had to do was to stop the movie like 7 minutes short and that would be quite interesting ending and suited for the story.
Nonetheless I actually was entertained."

" Avoid A Dark Forest... Oh And This Film Too.
",-0.296,-0.6634,2019-01-10 00:00:00,1,"A young woman named Sara (Natalie Dormer - best known for Games Of Thrones) travels to Japan. Sara is wanting to enter Japan's well known Suicide Forest to try and find her twin sister. Little does Sara know, she will find the forest is loaded with supernatural terror.As far the plot is concerned, this film had plenty of potential and I was overall curious to see Natalie Dormer take the main lead in this genre. It is also worth mentioning that this is a directional debut for Jason Zada.The Forest is film that tries to be creative but becomes instead offers very little to be positive about. The small quantity of characters are strongly annoying, bland and make careless choices. The film makes a huge demand for the viewer to follow people who are walking around, seeing visions (well, we think they are visions??) and are retelling the same stories over and over in an attempt to build their character.Considering the film's run time is over an hour and half, this was truly painful to finish. I found myself checking the runtime twice because I actually wasn't sure if I could handle watching it all the way to the end. I suffered through a very similar type of film earlier this year with ""The Dissapointments Room"".The Forest is film I wish I never watched, as I saw nothing exciting or fresh and I cannot recommend for anyone to watch.Overall, this has left me very disappointed. Considering the film has a positive audio track (as most of the film takes place in a creep Forest) the movie's ending alone will leave the audience feeling like someone gave them the middle finger. Sorry horror fans, this is a major snooze fest. Avoid.1.4/10

" Surprisingly creepy
",0.296,0.979,2018-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Nathalie Dormer decently portrays a twin sister, looking for her other half in a haunted/cursed forest. Ignoring all warnings, she slowly falls into the grip of the deities who roam there.I don't get the negative reviews. This movie is far from perfect, but it pretty damn well delivers. Dormer does a fine job, making you understand her motivations and dislike her choises and actions, because she is believable enough. The small supporting cast does a fine job as well.The director, cinematographer and sound crew breathe life into the forest, making it feel like a threatening character, in a small and claustrophobic surrounding. Special effects are few, subtle, but very effective and at times pretty convincing, resulting in various jump scares. And the ending is satisfying and original enough.As a fan of the horror genre, I truly feel this is one of the better, more effective, and especially: more scary movies of the last few years, and it succesfully blends western and eastern horror cinema. Fans shouldn't skip this one."

Some clueless, ignorant, white person who says ""pfft, imma do it anyway"" and that usually ends well doesn't it?Want to watch an excellent creepy/horror haunted forest movie? I HIGHLY recommend 'The Ritual'I found the main actress in this to be very one note. Her emotional range is next to nothing...and there is two of her in this film. Identical twins, played by the same actress, whose acting is average at best.I wanted to like it. But, as a horror fanatic I found it dull & predictable."

",-0.7717,-0.8294,2018-10-29 00:00:00,7,My take is the critics underrated this film by a wide margin . The story I found to be quite good. (Dormer) plays the both twin sister roles . Sara Price (Dormer) discovers her twin sister 'Jess (Dormer) has vanished in Japan's infamous 'Suicide Forest' It really exists i looked it up 'Aokigahara ' . Sara plunges into a the dark forest . She enters a tormented world where angry spirits mess with ones own reality . Its is a very good story and surreal.

Atmospheric, loved the creepy forest setting and reputation of Aokigaharaas the suicide forest. I have the say the supporting cast and majority of the other actors/actresses other than Dormer were pretty terrible. Lot of pointless flashbacks but a conclusive ending. Why did the brunette Dormer look like a crack addict. Why did blonde Natalie wear the same clothes the whole movie. Natalie is gorgeous but she looks like a cat. All in all , pretty average stuff, all a bit silly and hectic."

" A concept wasted
",-0.4939,-0.9949,2018-08-15 00:00:00,4,"As many other people have said, the suicide forest is a scary concept that could lend itself to an intriguing horror movie. Unfortunately it's used as a background to a subpar jumpscare fest filled with average effects designed to scare you. The main character is supposed to be a skeptic who is determined to save her sister but instead appears to be rude and clingy. She starts the movie by being rude to her boyfriend for wanting her to wait a little while and let the police handle her sister's disappearance. She then goes to Japan where the locals tell her that they believe that evil spirits roam the forest. Instead of being polite and respecting the local culture while remaining skeptical she goes to a bar and complains about how everyone in town is crazy. She meets a man who can hook her up with an off duty officer to help her through the forest. She jumps on the idea. Upon meeting the officer he says that he will reluctantly take her. When she asks why he is reluctant he tells her it's because she seems troubled and might end up hurting herself. She then implies that anyone with a family member they love would happily run into the forest despite its reputation. When they go off path to look for people contemplating suicide they spot her sister's tent. The officer says that it's getting late and that he wants them to head home so they don't get lost. The woman then throws a tantrum about not wanting to leave and check on her sister tomorrow. The officer lets her stay the night as long as she promises to stay where she is. She quickly gets lured out of her tent and starts running around before the man at the bar stops her and tries to bring her back to camp. After that it's just jump scares. She ends up killing the bar dude and herself by just being an easily manipulated idiot (she takes a knife to her arm thinking that it's a good way to gets someone's hand of of her arm instead of just stabbing the guy's arm). Her sister just turned out to be lost in the forest and gets out ok. It ends with her jumpscaring the officer who told her that she was being stupid. The jump scares rarely manage to scare anyone since they come up at predictable times and are usually just your everyday computer generated corpse. The characters are dull as well as the plot. Instead of making a cool movie about the ghosts making you want to die of your own free will due to the terrifying spirits convincing the protagonist that the world is cruel (what the movie tried to make you think it was) the movie is an average lost in the woods with jumpscares film."

",-0.09,-0.9692,2018-04-29 00:00:00,2,"The movie is badly written, the plot twists are just dumb and are just there to make the bad writing go somewhere.
to me this movie fails at so many levels it's hard to believe some people liked it.
things just start bad and go nowhere and does not make you compassionate about the situation, i was more annoyed by the beginning of this movie.
bad acting from the boyfriend, the dialogs are badly written and sometime just go nowhere, do nothing for the story and it's just boring, dumb and annoying, the main character just comes out as dumb and sad nothing more.
JUST TELL ME WHY she goes with a stranger to that forest, why even trust a guy you don't know especially when you are looking for your missing sister. the actual action in the movie is STUPID, cut off a chicken head and let it go, that represent the action.
the play between reality and the supernatural that happen is again really stupid and not very well used in this movie. the girl sees thing that aren't real and does not doubt for a second that it is real even after it happened lots f time that shows her that she's being tricked. 
Basically everything that happens in this movie is stupid and what happens is only there to put the main character in bad situations, if you take this movie and take out everything that could and would not be stupid and pointless, this movie would be about 30 minutes long and it would still be boring.
the ending is predictable and boring dumb and just confirms that you've watched a really dumb boring movie.
the only reason this movie still has people liking it, it's because of the quality of the filming and by that i mean they did take people who knew how to film good looking scenes, good angles etc...
still the most interesting thing to watch in this movies is Miss dormer, beautiful woman but not good enough actress to give a great performance in a so badly made movie."

Sara flies 6,000 miles to Japan and discovers Jess (Natalie Dormer with black hair) has gone missing in Japan's suicide forest. She manages to get two guys to help her look for her. The film is rather ho-hum up to about 45 minutes into the film when they (plot spoiler!) find her tent. It isn't until this point does the film become worth watching.

A horror film set in the infamous Aokigahara Forest where troubled individuals contemplate their lives and commit suicide should've been more frightening than this. Is this seriously the best they could do? Sara flies to Japan now knowing that her twin sister Jess went into the depths of the cursed forest. She must control her own paranoia and disillusioned mind as she embarks through the 'Sea Of Trees' (bonus points if you see what I did there) to find her sister. Natalie Dormer gives two decent dual performances, the cinematography is splendid and the setting is one of the most fascinating environments in the world. That's all this film has going for it. I physically cannot call this a horror film, there is legitimately nothing scary about this. Heck, some of the trees are scarier than the actual jump scares...seriously, look at those ghastly branches! All the jump scares consist of loud noises or someone's face that turns into a horrible grey ghost face thing...all too repetitive, all too boring. Sara and the gang come across one victim to suicide, which is atleast handled with more care than Logan Paul's controversial video (see...I can be current too!). The second act sees them walk around for thirty minutes as Sara hears voices or sees ghostly apparitions. That's all well and good, but when the tour guide clearly commands ""if you see anything unusual, it's not real it is just your mind"" you would acknowledge that right? Nooo Sara is thinking she only lives once, lets follow the creepy Japanese school girl in the middle of a dense forest. Then there is some backstory about her parents killing themselves, a few predictable twists and turns in the third act to then only conclude in unsatisfactory fashion. Honestly though, my expectations were low considering this was a first week January release...and still those expectations weren't met. Yawnnn."

The story is about a girl who goes to the suicide forest in search of her missing twin sister.

So,The Forest is a horror film that I always admired the idea of,I love the idea of a film setting in the famous Japanese suicide forest and I never actually got around to watching it so,while on Netflix,I watched it(as well as Poltergeist 2,stay in touch by the way as well for my reviews of the Poltergeist series). So,a girl goes in to these woods to look for her missing sister,that's pretty much it. The Forest,I really enjoyed,I didn't really have any problems with it,I found it very creepy and not something you'd slip away from with boredness. Natalie Dorman did a fantastic job as herself,and her other sister. I would call this film though more of a,say,Drama Thriller then a horror,there weren't much horror scenes in it,except for,ugh! The jump scares,all the time,but anyway,The Forest is a really good horror film,going down there as one of my favorites. Stay here guys for tomorrow's review though for Poltergeist,1,2 and 3,haven't got around to watching three,but I will watch it tomorrow,and then review it!!"
" Natalie Dormer's the best thing about this middling horror film
",0.128,0.3248,2017-09-24 00:00:00,5,"THE FOREST is another horror/thriller dealing with the sinister setting of the Aokigahara Forest in Japan. The said forest nestles at the foot of Mount Fuji and is notorious in Japan for being a place where suicides go to die. It has previously been the subject of two films, GRAVE HALLOWEEN and SEA OF TREES.Sadly, in the hands of an inexperienced director, THE FOREST is very much a middling horror film. It's too tame and predictable to really scare all but the most novice of viewers. The plot is slow paced and the cast limited to just a few faces, so there's little going on. Some of the atmosphere isn't bad and the filmmakers do a good job of making the location seem authentic, although of course it wasn't really shot in the actual forest. Best of all is the reliable Natalie Dormer, who invests her lead with depth and charisma that might have been lacking in another actress."

" Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen
",-0.6249,-0.9967,2017-06-13 00:00:00,2,"This is literally the first movie that I almost left the theater! The horrible acting, crappy/poorly animated jump scares, and the horrendous writing makes up this movie.Focusing more on the jump scares, they were really bad. There is literally a ""Jump scare"" of the main character walking down the hall of a hotel when suddenly the camera quickly zooms in on an old ladies badly CGI'd face (don't tell me why it was CGI'd the next cut it shows the old lady in real life) with a loud bang sound. It reminded me of the poorly made horror apps in the app store that try to scare people. There were other horrible jump scares including a random zombie person running at the camera?(Doesn't explain who it is or what it is).(SPOILERS) The story wasn't that bad, it's the execution that ruined that. Natalie Dormer had little to no emotion in this, she screamed a few times but that's about it. They talk about her twin sister a lot, who any logical person could tell, killed herself in the forest, but because of this really badly explained 'Kinetic Force' that connected them, Natalie's character went in. Rob made barely any sense, he was somehow the bad guy even though he had no motivations nor ways of being a bad guy and good guy, it only made sense if he was one, not both. Then maybe she was tripping and it wasn't him, I really don't know. Lastly, the end was an animated zombie running at the camera. WHAT THE FREAKING HECK? When the heck did zombies get thrown in this (Would have been a better movie if zombies were put into this earlier) It really made no sense at all. I mockingly acted scared when it happened because of how stupid it was, people in the audience were laughing and cringing after this end.All in all, this movie barely gets 2/10, the scenery is nice because it's Japan, it's hard to mess that up. There was a scary visual one time in a cave, but that's about it. Don't see this movie unless you want to waste your time!"
" Modern horror 101
",-0.5719,0.9607,2017-06-03 00:00:00,5,"I can tell you now this is going to be a short review. If you've watched a horror movie made after 'The Ring' (US remake, this is) then you've pretty much seen 'The Forest.' It seems that even though 'The Ring' didn't invent this type of film, it did make it popular enough to totally create the formula for a thousand similar films to come. The protagonist (normally a woman – in this case 'Game of Thrones' Natalie Dormer) comes across a spooky occurrence and sets out to investigate slowly.Natalie Dormer plays Sara, a twin whose sister goes missing in a forest in Japan. Therefore Sara has to travel half way round the world to investigate. Of course when she arrives she soon finds that local folklore states that the forest is well and truly haunted, due to the fact that many people seem to go there to die. So she investigates and – guess what – finds that it is definitely haunted. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. She doesn't go in alone. In order to create a little (obligatory?) s3xual tension, the night before she goes hiking into the depths of the forest, she meets a man in a bar who seems interested enough in her story to help her out. He makes it clear that he's a journalist and, along with helping her, wants to record her story for a future article. Actually, in a story that's pretty run-of-the-mill, he's one high point. You may expect him to be the 'gallant hero' type, however, he's actually a bit of a div – makes a nice change! Anyway, his failings in the role of 'leading/supporting' man can't really save the film. Like I say, if you know your modern horror (2000s+ give or take) you'll know how it goes – a slow build up on the tension then a load of shaky camera work and some jump scares, plus vaguely unsettling ghostly images to prove the film had a bit of a budget spent on make-up. By the time you get near the end of the film you can sort of guess the ending, i.e. everyone lives happily ever after, everyone dies horribly, or there's some sort of twist where it turns out that this was all some sort of virtual reality simulator created by vampires from the future. Either way, you won't really care. By this time you'll have been checking your Instagram account on your smartphone and have forgotten you were even watching this film.The actors were good enough. They did their best with what was provided. There just wasn't enough original material here to offer any seasoned horror buff anything new. If you've never seen a horror film before you'll probably adore 'The Forest.' Personally, being someone who has a DVD collection with 90% of titles ending 'of the Living Dead,' I've been here and moved on. Still, Natalie Dormer was good in Game of Thrones."

" Embarrassing cringey
",-0.3818,-0.9228,2017-04-21 00:00:00,6,"The Forest was one of the most talked about movies of 2016, due to a large amount of criticism of white washing. Before I start my review, I want to say that, I am a white male. I have Japanese friends. I asked them about this movie before I watched it and they said that the Japanese culture was respected well, and there was no need for a whitewashing call on this movie. This wasn't as good as I was expecting. The way it was hyped up throughout 2016 in reviews and talk of those who had seen the movie, I was expecting a solid 10/10 from opening credits to end credits. It wasn't that great. At all.First of all, don't get me wrong. I found it quite enjoyable to watch. I was creeped out quite a bit. Some of it really had me on edge. Some of it made me cackle at how bad it was. Let's be real – the tunnel creatures? The CGI on those was horrendous and I didn't even feel bad laughing as Sarah ran in terror. There are a lot of interesting theories surrounding this, and a lot of them make sense, but at the end of the day, without the knowledge of the different theories, the film doesn't make a lot of sense, especially at the end. I wasn't keen, I got very confused through a lot of it, and there could have been a LOT MORE done to ensure that it wasn't confusing. Things could have been cut out, other things could have been done better and it would have made the film a lot easier to follow.The ending? I'm sick of the last few seconds of cliché of a character jumping at the screen. That's one thing this movie did really, really badly – it overused horror clichés to the point of it just being embarrassing.All in all though, it was quite scary, it had me on edge, and I found it to be quite unnerving, when it wasn't being embarrassing."
" Fails to See the Woods for the Trees
",-0.4215,-0.9934,2017-04-16 00:00:00,5,"Given the incredibly creepy nature of the infamous Suicide Forest in Japan, it is a pity that this film fails to utilise its tragic mise-en- scene, but it does, badly. Like many other reviewers, I'm not fully clear exactly what happens in this film beyond the interminable jump-scare ending dream sequences (and an over-reliance on such scenes is always a sure sign of creative bankruptcy in a horror film) and the sub-Ringu forest wraith who keeps popping up hither and thither. As said, the creepy factor should have been set to 10 in this film given the forest setting (and the poignant fact that the Suicide Forest is all too real). However, the film loses focus in terms of the desperate search for the missing sister and just drifts away into a pointless and bizarre 'psycho killer' angle, and then peters out into an unclear conclusion. Hence, as the final scene fades with a daft CGI 'scare', the viewer is ultimately left with a film that is both unsatisfying and disappointing. Although, for me, the film's biggest shock is not the mournful forest and its lost souls, but that it took three writers to pen a script that does not really make any sense or have any narrative impact. Now that is scary."

The film starts with the girl missing her twin sister played by the main character and the premise was a great idea especially with the idea of the sister missing in the Aokigahara forest, I thought this will be cool how disappointed I finally was. They could have explored much more but instead made the main character annoying and very bland. With a good script this would have been one of the better horror movies in some time."
" Forget the Forest.
",-0.2263,-0.9842,2017-01-27 00:00:00,2,"Trying to be kind to this Film is difficult. Like so many recent 'Horror' Films this just falls flat on almost every level and like so many, frustratingly so. We've all - certainly in more recent years- heard of this Forest and have no doubt heard of the numerous cases of people going here to sadly end their lives. So to then make a Film specifically and unapologetically set in and around this location should have led to one hell of an offering, filled with drama, suspense and genuine psychologically based 'Horror'.Instead what we have here is void of all these components. We also have a poorly cast leading Actress who couldn't carry her shopping never mind a Film, poor dialogue between characters and to be honest what seemed to be a mish mash of conflicting ideas as to what direction the plot should take. There was little cohesion in this Film sadly. We had the usual trope of people doing stupid things, saying stupid things and generally just acting stupid. There was no drama, no suspense and nothing of any psychological depth. There were plenty of attempted jump scares though sadly even for them you knew exactly where and when they were coming and so even the vain hope that they could somehow save this was sadly lost.Overall a sadly pathetic attempt at Film making."
" One of the least scary things ever...
",0.3875,-0.9261,2017-01-23 00:00:00,2,"I have a confession to make: I don't consider Jump scares to be real horror. Real horror should be something that makes you think....something you analyze late at night...and then realize the true meaning....and you are then kept awake the whole night by your realization. Or you could just have a scary face go ""BLAH!"" at the screen Presenting: The Forest Now, Aokighara Forest is a really scary place with a lot of opportunities, for scares...but they just go and waste it all. It's impossible to get invested in our main character because she's completely bland, and as a result we can't give a crap about her quest. Everyone else? Just as bland if not blander than our main. Only watch if you are DESPERATE for something scary...and even then something like ""The Amityville Horror"" could probably suit your needs more."
" Do Not Fear This Forest.
",0.3875,-0.9917,2017-01-15 00:00:00,4,"Back in the 90's, when the internet was still new to people, there was a 'fun' craze that people would send others via email. You'd open the attachment and be told to have your volume up high while starring at a serene picture. Then out of nowhere a spooky face when pop up on the screen with a loud scream. It would freak people out, a classic jump scare. This is all The Forest is, cheap jump scares.I'm surprised at how well this horror film was received with the critics because I found it to be lacking. The premise is good enough for a spooky horror film, but The Forest never bothers to use the setting it thrusts itself in to genuine scary effect. It's sad actually, that the film fails on these levels because I can only thing, 'what could have been'. Sara discovers that her twin sister Jess has disappeared in Japan. She was last seen heading into Aokigahara, known as the Suicide Forest. Believing her to still be alive, Sara heads to Japan and into the woods with a guide to find her. Natalie Dormer, of Game of Thrones fame, headlines this horror flick and plays double duty as the twins. The role doesn't ask much of her, just to be scared when needed and yell her sisters name a bunch of times. Taylor Kinney ventures into the forest with her. He's a journalist that hopes to cover the story. Are things what they seem with him? Who knows, the film doesn't really bother to answer these questions. The horror elements don't really come into effect until late in the film, by then I felt bored by the tepidness of everything. The film takes place in a spooky forest for crying out loud, but it never takes advantage of this. It's the perfect atmosphere that a better director could creatively use to his/her advantage. This is why The Forest is such a disappointment, even by horror standards. It's just not scary. Were told not to believe what we see in the forest, I can't believe I watched this."
" Average Run-Of-The-Mill Horror
",-0.5719,0.8895,2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Aokigahara forest - also known as Suicide Forest - has long been a notoriously frequent suicide spot for the area's local inhabitants, but it's now also become a destination for filmmakers to create thrills & tears from this foreboding stretch of woodland. The Forest is the latest film to attempt the former and while there are a few moments of eeriness, overall the film falls a bit flat as it tends to rely on the usually predictable ""jump scares"" rather than story or atmosphere.For the first third of the film I thought it was fine. It was interesting enough and seemed to be building up a decent enough story for the rest of the movie, but it seemed to run out of ideas and never really got out of 2nd gear. It just seemed to just stall every time it attempted to get going. I found that it got repetitive as well. A character would see something in the forest, go to investigate, and something would happen. Wash, rinse, repeat. Doing this will only keep the audience interested for so long, especially if it just ends with the aforementioned ""jump scare"".As for the characters, well, they are the usual cliché-ridden types that will do exactly what they are told NOT to do, like go chasing something they think they have seen in the forest and end up becoming lost. I think the PG-13 rating had a hand in a lot of how this film panned out because you can only do so much with a PG-13 horror, so a group of teens may end up enjoying the film more than us adults.All in all, The Forest is an OK film to watch but it's probably one of those types of films where you'll see it once then just maybe never bother with it again.Then again, I'd rather watch this film again than the utter tripe that gets continually shown on TV."
