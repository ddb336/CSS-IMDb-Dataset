" Good one
",0.4404,0.2298,2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,Good one.Mardaani 2 was a bit more better I feel.But the story content in Mardaani 1 is very thought provoking in terms of the plight and suffering of kidnapped girls.
" Powerful Film
",0.4215,0.9062,2021-02-05 00:00:00,10,"We watched ""Mardaani"" with our Mom and we all enjoyed it even though we had to read the subtitles. Rani Mukherji is such a great actress. She portrayed her character well. It was believable. Her movies are powerful for the message they convey to the watchers."
" Amazed me
",0.4939,0.8402,2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Power of girl,Women is great as well as Mardaani, has shown that only and even shows women,girls should now be powerful"
" A good movie
",0.4404,0.7741,2020-12-09 00:00:00,8,Watching this movie in 2020 I think one of the best film in crime genre in that year they took one of the burning issue of the World and india and built a very good story . But it comes to acting rani's acting is little over but other than that film was good and one time watchable
" MARDAANI
",0.0,0.6124,2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,Rani Mukherji Nailed Her Acting .... Brilliantly Power Pack Performance..
" Promising movie let down by climax
",0.4019,-0.2484,2020-09-11 00:00:00,5,I was thinking of a 7/10 rating until the climax came about it really dragged down my opinion on the film. Promising script hopelessly let down by Indianised masala climax
" fits bollywood.
",0.0,0.0,2020-08-15 00:00:00,6,It hits all the checklist of a bollywood film.(except songs). Its has everything that a indian crowd is looking for in a movie.
" Decent attempt about Girl Child Safety.
",0.4215,0.8442,2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"Having viewing lot of movies on girl trafficking, one has to promote the underlined point in the film inspite of its routine story line. To be frank, there is nothing new we will witness about the movie about girl trafficking. The difference comes at the poing where lady officer leads the team. Rani Mukherjees hard work and home work for this movie is clearly evident through out the movie. She was very near to a police officers behavior. Detailed explanation about each and every twist or suspense, gave the feeling of spoon feeding. In the end when the culprit askes her how did she do this, her explanantion goes so clearly that audience have missed the first half of the movie where it is shown that she is one of the intelligent cop s in department. Having said that, with no men support and shadow this film stands still on ghe toes of lady named rani mukherjee and reason beingthe rescue of girl child by a lady. Action scenes were very realistic. I must mention both the bgm and acting of the villain. That bgm was lit. A One Time Watch Movie."
" Villan Character is crazy
",-0.34,0.1779,2020-06-25 00:00:00,10,"Must watch one of the criminal movies.
Great movie must watch ."
" Very very interesting movie till start to end
",0.5059,0.2094,2020-06-08 00:00:00,10,Very interesting movie....India fights back.....All women girl learn from movie mardaani. It's important to our country and worldwide
" Not up to mark.
",0.0,0.9088,2020-05-28 00:00:00,5,"A film which didnt meet the expectations. Though the content is very serious and thrilling, the way film has been is not thrilling. Also cant say the film is eventful. Jus a single time watch for the importance of content and beauty of Rani."

Review:
The movie is based on a psycho who deals with child trafficking.
Rani mukherjee in terrific form. she enacts the cop with rage & intensity.
The movie raises awareness of such gruesome which preys over 40,000 innocent children of the country every year."
" Could have been better. Honestly preferred the second film. Strange I know.
",0.6249,0.357,2020-02-20 00:00:00,3,"Rather cringey with the women empowerment song at the end. If your making a dark film, with obvious bleak content, don't add loud obnoxious songs."
" zero masala! only emotion.
",0.0,0.8732,2020-02-19 00:00:00,10,I always don't want to watch Hindi or any Bollywood movies. But sometimes movies like this nail you down. Love the script and character of Shivani and her attitude. Rani Mukerji lived that character.
" Why we love classic Bollywood
",0.6369,0.9677,2020-01-06 00:00:00,9,"It is extremely cheesy, over-the-top and characters almost cartoonish...but I LOVED IT!!! I love Rani Mukherjee, one of the best (if not THE best) actresses the Indian film industry ever produced. It was really enjoyable to see her shed the usual glam heroine role to turn into this badass Shivani Roy. Also the subject matter is very much real, we need this type of empowerment happening in the nation. Only Rani could pull this role off."
" Good Movie with a Bad Title.
",-0.1531,0.8147,2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"It's funny how they named a woman-centric movie is titled Mardaani (manliness). If you give a pass to that cringy dialogue and song at the end, Mardaani is quite a fresh and great approach to the subject.
I loved the casting. Especially the villain. He doesn't fit into the image of underworld sex trafficking villain we've seen. He looks like the boy next door. Almost all the actors looked real except for the kids. But that's understandable.
We've seen a lot of movies where a police officer doesn't play by the rules and does what he feels right. Even though Shivani Shivaji Roy(Rani Mukharjee) is such a character, the fact that she is woman along with everything else in the movie makes it special.
I recommend you watch this."
" A classic anecdote for what is happening today in the society
",0.0,-0.5983,2019-12-11 00:00:00,10,"The movie is all about Sex Trafficking Mafia and how a crime branch officer deals with it. The movie goes smoothly until one point where all the strands of your hairs erects. Yes, something you call as GOOSEBUMPS. The ending song is just dope! I regret of not watching it bedore"
" Hats Off to this Movie!
",0.0,0.9558,2019-12-02 00:00:00,10,Rani Mukherjee has justified the Role. The Direction is Amazing and all the Actors have successfully made this Movie the Greatest Hit of 2014 by their Fabulous Efforts!
" Poor making for a good content...
",-0.0516,0.7579,2019-10-16 00:00:00,4,"Am rated 4 stars and all that credits goes to the guy who played villain role in this movie... This is a poor direction ... Every seen feels like individual. Basically there is no fluency .... But I strongly believe that the director of the movie can do much better movie next time...
And again villain of the filim is simply awesome ðŸ’žðŸ’žðŸ’ž"
" Not ur regular Bollywood trash, tight script, crispy editing n lots of tension n suspense.
",-0.3182,0.3462,2018-03-25 00:00:00,9,"I first saw this in a theatre with my dad n son. Revisited it recently on a dvd.
It is a solid crime thriller. Rani Mukherjee pulled of the job of a cop very well.
The fight sequences r top notch n thank God ther ain't any songs in this film.
People may find similarities with Trade (2007) n Taken (2008)."
" Intense crime-drama with screenplay that falls in place!
",0.1511,0.923,2017-09-02 00:00:00,9,"Mardaani is a movie about how a female cop (Rani) Takes on mafias of sex trafficking to search for a girl who is like family.Movie is a thriller with tight screenplay that keeps you glued to your seat till end.Rani Mukherji has acted very well. One can clearly see how exceptional she is.One of the main reasons I review this movie was that I noticed Namaz and was curious why it was there and when Rani highlighted it, it felt nice. I just wanted to share that.Watch it, it is exceptional movie."
