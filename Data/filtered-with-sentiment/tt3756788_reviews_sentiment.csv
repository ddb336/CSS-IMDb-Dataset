" Pros and cons
",0.0,0.0789,2021-03-22 00:00:00,3,"Pros:The 2 long-haired sisters are pretty. They are all thin (no tattooed trash here)Cons:No exaggeration, the most jaded movie I've seen in a while. Boring premise and nothing really happens. Don't bother with this one."
" A Pleasant Time and That's All About It
",0.5106,0.8321,2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"This movie was based on a manga. It flows like one albeit with invisible chapters and goes through the same tropes and stock events. It surely could be better and I feel that it was restricted by not improving the source material.Nothing really happens in the story compared to the fast-food of emotions of modern film-making. It is refreshing to focus on little things and not shifting to irrational emotional extremes or artificial conflicts. The characters are mostly trying to make peace with themselves through normal events of life.Again, nothing happens. It doesn't need to. Like in real life, people are briefly in our lives an their plots doesn't resolve to us when they go. It was worth just to spend two hours with these four sisters. A pleasant time."
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.6517,2020-12-16 00:00:00,3,"And not just because I need explosions in every movie. This just has nothing.
Four girls. Do we see any skin?? No!!
They do meet, go shopping and a stroll though!?!?"
" It's all in the family!
",0.0,0.9776,2020-11-21 00:00:00,9,"The sisterhood depicted in this movie made me wish I too had a sister or two! The family values and simplicity depicted in the movie are very refreshing. It made me realize that there still are people in the world who are absolutely capable of making great sacrifices for their family. It's a heart-warming movie to watch which makes us all realize that family is the most important thing in life.Everything is done very tastefully. It helped me understand a bit of the Japanese culture. The house, which is also one of the important characters in the film, is very endearing & homey. I would love to live in such a simple yet beautiful home. The sleepy sea-side town is bewitchingly beautiful, which is like the cherry on top of the cake! Oh, and check out the beautiful cherry blossoms!The only problem is that the movie is a bit too upbeat (unbelievably so at times) and most characters accept each other at the face value; something which rarely happens in real life. However, this movie did made me imagine what such an open and simple society would feel like where it's not just about pursuing hedonistic pleasures, but also about doing something meaningful!"
" Beautiful movie about family
",0.5994,0.837,2020-11-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a beautiful Japanese movie about three sisters connecting with their step-sister after the death of their father. The youngest sister, Suzy, comes to live with her older, step-sisters. The acting is flawless throughout in this joyful drama"
" Cozy film
",0.0,0.7609,2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Another one of those comfy Japanese slice of life movies, which they are so well versed in producing. It's a subtle, mellow, charming, heart-warming family themed film for a cozy evening."
" Underlying Magic and Comfort in Unfamiliarity
",0.3612,0.0,2020-10-06 00:00:00,9,"Simply one of Kore-eda's sublime works. The film dives into family ties and complexities, its exceptions and compensations, to its fulfillment. A refreshing slow-paced film that will take viewers to a familiar experience found in strangers' story."
" Nothing happens

3 sisters who welcome a 4th half sister to live with them

" Not Bad.
",0.431,0.5859,2020-08-10 00:00:00,7,"The living things are very laborious light Japanese family film. Just smile and calm, you can untie the knot."
" Gentle and touching
",0.4404,0.9976,2020-07-11 00:00:00,8,"A film that's as gentle as the water lapping against the shoreline at the end, but communicates touching truths about carrying hidden pain in life, that from parental neglect. Early on in the film, three sisters attend their father's funeral, and we come to understand that he left them and their mother long ago, and they're also estranged from their mother. They meet a younger stepsister and invite her to live with them, and the film shows them carrying out their daily activities, reflecting on their parents, and facing inevitable change. They all seem to be coping with life reasonably well, buoyed by the support they give one another, and I suppose that's one of the main messages of the film, that broken families can get through life through love and kindness to one another.One of my favorite moments is when his daughters are talking after their father's funeral about how kind he was, but also naïve (""useless"" they say) in loaning money and a womanizer who cheated on his wife. Kore-eda then cuts to the smoke from his cremation wafting out of a smokestack into the blue sky, and then his daughters walking away down the road. The man is literally going up into the smoke of nothingness, and they muse quietly over his life, and it's not with extreme bitterness or melodramatic emotion. There is such grace and calm acceptance here, even when later the oldest daughter takes her stepsister up to the vista and shouts out her anger in a form of catharsis, another fantastic scene. Another character is remembered for thinking fondly of the cherry blossoms on her deathbed, and saying ""I'm so happy that beauty still looks beautiful to me."" To be able to still see the beauty and goodness in life even when one is damaged or suffering is to transcend the human condition, at least in some way, and this film is so touching in how it communicates that.This is a very quiet film though, maybe too quiet for some, and there are no big plot twists or dramatic moments. Along the way, Kore-eda gives us beautiful shots, like the walk along the autumn leaves, the bike ride under the 'tunnel' of cherry blossoms, and the reflection of fireworks in the water in the overhead shot of the boat. The unconditional love the sisters give to their new stepsister, and the words of the elderly café owner to her, ""I'm jealous of your father and mother, because they left a treasure like you behind on this earth"" are incredibly powerful when they come though, and hit me like a ton of bricks. It's just a lovely, graceful film, one that may get a higher rating upon a re-watch."
" I really want to travel to Japan!!
",0.2908,0.9336,2020-04-09 00:00:00,9,"Hirokazu kore-eda took his Japanese family drama to the extreme.Under the gentle technique and camera lens, four sisters form a beautiful and close family like a dream in kamakura beach, and their resentment towards their parents and personal problems are dissolved in the sweet sisterly affection.The warm life of ordinary Japanese people and the beautiful scenery of kamakura make people yearn for it.I really want to travel to Japan, just settle down for half a year."
" Eating, cooking, talking and eating
",0.0,-0.9373,2020-01-25 00:00:00,6,"This movie could have been really good. All the dramatic elements was there, but unfortunately the movie doesn't reach its fullest potential.I usually have no difficulties with slower story telling, but this movie is not just slow, it's boring. That's sad, because the movie offers an extraordinary peek into modern Japanese culture and family life, knowledge that it's hard to get, if not living in that country.By the way, has anyone counted, how many times they are eating, cooking or talking about food in the movie?"
" Ah, what a beautiful film
",0.5994,0.9875,2019-10-09 00:00:00,8,"The source material (manga) is masterfully adapted into a 2 hour film.
Excellent cast, direction, cinematography, everything in it (Kamakura is such a beautiful place)! I fell in love with all the characters (I specially liked Midoriko Kimura's role of the Cafe owner)..Everything in this movie feels so real, and lively. But also filled with emotions. And the theme and general feeling (what you take with you once done) is quite heavy, even if it is something simple we can all understand. I love the kind of stories that put a smile on my face, even if I felt my heart being tugged a bit. You can see the love that was put in it by everyone involved.Would easily recommend to anyone.. specially to those that sometimes just stop to realize they are alive."
" Slow but gorgeous
",0.7579,0.9705,2019-05-18 00:00:00,8,"This is a soft story, told slowly and deliberately. But the story is sweet and the scenery is gorgeous. This movie presents an interesting view of real life in Japan. If you've never been to Japan, it's worth the watch just for the beauty and rawness of real life."
" Nothing happens
",0.0,0.8847,2019-03-30 00:00:00,8,A film looking at the interaction of 3 sisters and 1 step sister. Nothing happens but it is full of poignant interactions between family members and is beautifully filmed and gently paced. It's for you if you like life affirming movies but please don't watch it and then criticise it as seriously Nothing Happens.
" A heartwarming masterpiece
",0.802,0.5605,2019-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Hirokazu Koreeda is one of my favorite Japanese director in the past decade, and this film doesn't disappoint me at all, I've watched it twice yesterday and watch it yet again today. One of the most difficult things for screenwriter to do in a screenplay is how to choose and arrange the incidents in the movie: which scene should be happened on screen and which one should not? which part of the story is necessary for the overall pacing and theme, and which ones are not? Hirokazu is a master in this kind of aspect of a film, he knows which scene are essential, and which one are not. Every scene has its own story, and there're always something to tell.This film is an emotional complexed film, every characters have their own issues, but all of theme tied with the main story of this movie: Suzu, the struggles and conflicts she has with her half-sisters, though there're no physical conflicts, but by the dialogues and the amazing storytelling of Hirokazu, you can always tell that there're something going on in the inside. She blamed herself for the conflicts her sisters have with her mother, she blamed herself for being the daughter of the one that destroyed her sisters' life and their mother's life. But what this movie did is that it didn't demonize those characters that were to blame, instead, it seems to forgive the people that causing this kind of situation, because that's how life is, no one is right nor wrong, there's always a broader idea of the problem. Their father wanted to go back but he didn't have the courage to do so, the mother can't bare the house she once lived in but at the same time she's sad for not being with her daughters.In the end, they solved the problem piece by piece, and realize the most important thing to do is to forgive and let go of the past, they walked by the sea and thanked for their father for giving them a little sister.There're so many scenes that I loved, one of my favorite is when Chika asking Suzu about their father, her facial expression says it all, her joyfully acknowledgement of her father's fishing habit fills with happiness and pity. Every actress in this film is top-class, especially Haruka and Suzu, and I just love their mother's performance, which was played by Midoriko, though she didn't have that much screen time, but every scene she's in, I can always feel the pain and struggle she has inside.Nevertheless, this is definitely worth the watch, and I may will watch it again soon."
" Cute and delicate
",0.4939,0.9217,2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,"This is a cute, simple, relaxing and delicate film just as anything Japanese. It is great to immerse yourself in this little picture of Japanese culture. Japan is a special and unique country and the world has a lot to learn from it."
" A horribly pointless and slow drama...
",-0.5267,-0.8608,2019-03-17 00:00:00,3,"I must admit that I am a sucker for anything Asian, and given the chance to sit down and watch an Asian movie I will gladly do so. So it was that I was given the chance to watch the 2015 ""Umimachi Diary"" (aka ""Our Little Sister"") from director/writer Hirokazu Koreeda based on the Manga from writer Akimi Yoshida.Sadly this movie was unfathomably slow paced and had next to nothing to tell in terms of a properly entertaining and captivating storyline. Sure, the movie had great acting performances, but the plot and storyline was just so horribly slow paced and irrelevant that the actresses struggled a losing battle no matter how well they performed.I managed to endure 1 hour of the ordeal that is known as ""Umimachi Diary"" before I gave up out of sheer and utter boredom. I have no intention of returning to finish the rest of the movie, because there was nothing entertaining here, and just watching the female actresses trying to stay afloat in a sinking script hardly proves for proper entertainment.This drama might certainly have an audience out there somewhere, sadly I was not in the target audience. But then again, I can't claim to have been familiar with anything about the movie prior to stumbling upon it by sheer random luck.There are far better Japanese movies in the drama genre, so I am advising you to find something else if you are in for an evening of Japanese drama on the screen."
" A beautifully made, affirming film
",0.5719,-0.7792,2019-01-21 00:00:00,10,"One of the sweetest, most uplifting movies I've ever seen. I kept expecting some horrible tragic occurrence to spin the the plot in a we've seen a thousand times, but instead it remains a gentle and affirming movie from beginning to end, while never becoming saccharin. I cannot recommend this movie enough, especially if you've had a bad day and need to watch something uplifting"
" Good Enough
",0.4404,0.9344,2019-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Our little sister sounds like a great movie. And there were some emotiontionally moving scenes, as well as great sisterhood dynamics. However, the story just lacks interest. It lacks intensity, even though the story is quit strong. There were some good character development though. And the performances were good from all the characters. But, even though it wasn't boring, it just didn't lead anywhere. So, all in all, six out of ten because the cinematography and the execution were nice, but the plot weak."
" Bit of a let down
",0.0,-0.7148,2018-11-05 00:00:00,4,"Oh I so wanted to like this film... I wanted to enjoy the atmosphere and the setting of the movie. But it was just so boring. Oh my goodness it was dull.On top of that, there were quite a few 'emotional' scenes and setups that left me cold. Firstly, the film kicks off with the news that their father had died, I've always found any stories that begin in such a way very lazy - oh, you want me to empathize with these characters not because of who they are and how they are written as people, but because of an event (tragic or otherwise)? In fact the whole first twenty minutes of the film seemed overly rushed and confusing. Why not spend more time in the countryside finding out about their fathers last days than rushing back home?Ho hum... It's a shame as I wanted to like the film and it does have a lot of merits, but the story was very bland and I will forget everything about this film before long."
" Belongs to Kore'eda's favorite theme but this one is not one of his original tales
",0.6059,0.969,2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,"The film is tender to the core. It is written by Kore'eda, but it is based on an existing manga novel by Akimi Yashida. One of the few non-original story departures of the director.Is the film different from the rest of his work? Most of his work relates to absent parents and their children. This film conforms to that pattern. Here there are four female characters longing for their dead/missing father and a missing mother. Like Euripides' ""The Trojan Women"" perhaps where the women longed for their husbands?The film belongs to the strong character Sachi and the beautiful actress Aruka Hayase's performance as Sachi, the other actresses Suzu Hirose as Suzu and the wonderful elderly late Kirin Kiki.Also commendable for a Kore'eda film is the music composed for the film by Yoko Kanno.A very delicate film, very Asian. Or modern Asian, would be more precise a description, since each of the unmarried women have their own private affairs/lovers known to the other sisters."
" Light as a Cherry Blossom, Sour & Sweet
",0.4588,0.9246,2018-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Feathery episodic nuggets float, fall, and accumulate to tell a gently emotional, meaningful story of four sisters. Beautifully photographed, edited, and directed, well-cast and performed, with lovely, understated music.Turn off your phone, and if you have sisters, watch this movie with them."
" Only literal fireworks, but better for it.
",0.5927,0.9977,2018-04-30 00:00:00,7,"Our Little Sister (Japanese: Umimachi Diary {Seaside Town Diary}) (2015) 
Director: Hirokazu Koreeda 
Watched: April 2018 
Rating: 7/10 Sachi, Yoshino, Chika. Three sisters, living together, growing up, learning the ways of the world. Like any set of sisters, there are fights, but there is also love. Their father has abandoned them for another woman. Their mother has abandoned them for another man. They will not abandon each other. For better or worse. They receive the unforeseen news of their father's death. At his funeral, they receive- not something, but someone- even less foreseen. Their half-sister Suzu. Taking an immediate liking to her, they invite her to live with them. She accepts. This is a film far more than the sum of its parts. Alone, most scenes are mundane, even taxing to watch. Put all together, though, we have a heartfelt drama with a coming-of-age aspect. The house they cherish and reside in serves as its own character. One must be patient to appreciate the bonding moments between the sisters. Koreeda masterfully portrays the transformation from strangers to family; the slow push and pull in the formation of a lasting relationship. Some lovely cinematography, notably the long shots of scenery and water, the cherry blossom ""tunnel"" (you can feel yourself there; you can feel the transformative meeting the bicycle ride under those trees has for Suzu), walks along the beach (the sisters, Suzu and her boyfriend, when Sachi tells her lover she can not move with him, then again in the final scene), scream therapy on the mountains (Sachi: ""You can talk about {your mother} if you like. You can stay here as long as you like.""; Suzu: ""I want to stay here forever.""). Clever use of slow-motion, e.g. Riding under the tunnel of cherry blossom trees and the four sisters bonding over fireworks.There are moments of unexpected tension and even suspense, like the meeting between Suzu and her father's ex-wife (her half-sisters' mother) or eldest sister Sachi's heated arguments with her mother, who abandoned the girls at an early age. There are the usual Koreeda staples like finding beauty in everyday things, examinations of life and death including (multiple) funerals, family honor eloquently portrayed, cultural differences like respect accurately portrayed in stark contrast to what is familiar to foreign viewers. Give this storyline to a director in this country and it would be a completely different film. For one thing, you can bet it would not be anywhere near this delicate and lyrical. It is easy to recognize Koreeda's work- his directing, in a way, invisible. It is an oxymoron. You know it when you see it, because it almost feels like an artful documentary, subdued in its excitement, unsensational in its story; but remarkable in its effect, powerful in its hold long after watching. Admittedly, this film does drag out. Mostly it is for the better. There are a few debatably superfluous scenes. One should watch this prepared to be taken on a meandering cruise through these girls' early adult lives. Some Koreeda films have unforgettable messages, enlightening stories. This one is more of an artful observation. There will be no figurative fireworks- only the literal ones in a couple endearing scenes. It is called contemplative cinema, after all. Sisters are a special bond. On a personal note- having an estranged sister- this film especially spoke to me. Late night visits in each others' rooms, ""liquid courage"" bonding, priceless moments of laughter. Koreeda and these lesser known actresses made some magic here in portraying the uniqueness of sister relationships. Cheesy but still sweet final scene lines from Sachi: ""Dad was not really good man, but he must have been a kind one... He left behind a sister like her for us.""

" Super Overrated. Nothing really happens...
",0.5994,0.9905,2017-05-14 00:00:00,3,"This is your typical example of ""The Emperor's New Clothes""If you have better and more important things to do, this is not a film to watch. You're really not missing anything by skipping this film. It's one of those sleeper films that you'd play during midnight and eventually fall asleep to. Don't get me wrong, I was actually excited to watch this, but I mean seriously, somebody has to speak out the truth -- this is really just your average movie where nothing really happens. So it has a cute cast, especially Suzu Hirose, and it's by a well known acclaimed director (seems where most of the bias is coming from), but there's no real suspense/drama/conflict or anything. It's just like another overrated film ""Linda Linda Linda"", where nothing really happens, but people seem to love it just because of the girls.One might argue, ""Well, it's showing the real life day in the life of that Hollywood can never make!"" Well, of course they won't make something like this because it's just simply boring; just showing sisters taking care of each other is absolutely boring. (I mean, honestly, I don't care for Hollywood blockbuster/action films/especially all the superhero movies either, I'm obviously not expecting that, but I also watch a lot of foreign/Japanese films and this really is overrated stuff.) Sure, to a foreigner, just seeing the countryside location taking place in Kamakura, Japan, and random bike riding scenes under the cherry blossoms is all beautiful and all, but that's all superficial. Where's the story? Too many Weeaboos, or people exclusively watching this at film festivals, overpraising this film than what it really is."
" Family matters
",0.0258,0.9892,2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"""Our Little Sister"" centers around four sisters, their lives and their relationships. It may look like a small, complacent, too slow and contemplative movie, but Koreeda, with the help of amazing acting all around, elevates the proceedings and delivers a really good movie.Sachi, Yoshino and Chika are three sisters that have lived together for some years. Their father left, marrying again, and their mother run away, leaving them behind. The death of the father brings all of them to his funeral, where they meet their half-sister Suzu. Sachi, the oldest, offers Suzu go living with them, and Suzu accepts, the four starting to live together.From that moment on the movie develops slowly, but securely, with great character development, a couple of very touching moments, and a focus on human relationships and the reasons behind our behavior. That Koreeda has restrained Haruka Ayase, charming Masami Nagasawa, happy-go-lucky Kaho and innocent but smart looking Suzu Hirose as the four sisters helps, as they embody their characters and bring them to life. The plot helps, with little vignettes that help develop the story and entice the viewer's attention.The movie is a little bit slow, but you won't care, because what you will care about is these four sisters, their world, their problems and the relationship they have between themselves and with all that surrounds them. Great."
" Puts your typical Hollywood film to shame
",-0.4767,0.9671,2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Like so many foreign films, this is devoid of special effects, tiresome action sequences, gratuitous sex and violence-- just a lovely little gem that truly makes you feel at its conclusion like you were immersed in another culture for awhile. You forget that these people are actors-- it's more like watching real sisters in real life. One also comes away wanting to visit rural Japan-- it was refreshing to see more of the countryside as opposed to the large cities with all the congestion and crowding. All in all, if you are looking for a movie that leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy at its conclusion, look no further-- ""Our Little Sister"" is an excellent film and I highly recommend it!"
