" cardboard oscar-bait that should have been a documentary
",0.0,-0.0799,2020-11-17 00:00:00,3,"Wooden and stiff actors, inconsistent and unconvincing characters with no personality at all, interminable screenplay with insufferable name-dropping all over the place. Insults audience intelligence - FINE, we get that Schoenberg's an Austrian composer, you happy now? The mesage of this film is just: Nazi bad, Austrian culture good.A documentary would have been a much more compelling and respectful treatment of the subject matter than this pretentious, unintelligent mess. I will make a note to avoid all future projects made by the director and screenplay writer."
" ""Based-on-true-story"" are always the best
",0.6369,0.9312,2020-11-10 00:00:00,9,"""Based of true story"" are always the best in my opinion... I was driven and focused on the story from the begining. The acting of Helen Mirren was really good as she makes us part of her life. Flashback moments are introduced perfectely as well."
" What's your intention to watch a movie?
",0.0,0.9911,2020-08-19 00:00:00,10,"Serious question, as this intention will influence your opinion.If you wish to watch a - more or less - historically acurate movie, you'll like this one. It's full of (valid) stereotypes, historic references and information.If you wish to watch an interesting movie that entertains you, one that is full of emotion and life, you'll like this one. It's a masterpiece of an emotional roller coaster ride.If you wish to watch a movie full of stars, however you define that term, you'll like this one as all actors are simply top notch (and Katie Holmes only has a minor role).Seriously, this movie is 10/10 in everything. Great cast with a lot of harmony in between (even in conflict), a well written book, fine cinematography etc. etc. etc.You won't like the movie if your political opinion is somehow distorted by populist events in the last years, but hey... I don't care about you in that case :-)Watch it. Enjoy a wonderful Helen Mirren and a great Ryan Reynolds and a lot of other great actors. Cry. Smile. Enjoy."
" This movie has it all!
",0.0,0.2263,2020-06-14 00:00:00,10,"Such a compelling historical story, full of many ups and downs and runs the gamut of emotions."
" Good story, sad casting
",-0.0516,-0.1704,2020-06-12 00:00:00,1,"First of all, the film itself is very good in every way. Every now and then something was depicted completely idiotic or modern in the retrospect overlooked, which is half as bad.
Then why am I rating so low? Well, that's easy to explain: if in a film about Austria with apparently only Austrians, only 1 person is actually Austrian in real life and then only has a mini-role with 10 seconds, the producer must be condemned for it.If a complete film is made about a particular country, at least some of it should be occupied by residents of that country. Alone to maintain the authenticity of the respective country.So, as good as it may be, I can only completely devalue the film."
" Brilliant movie
",0.5859,0.7906,2020-05-13 00:00:00,9,"If Helen Mirren is starring, you know the movie is worth seeing. The acting, story line, script, suspense are all first class. The reality of the horror of WWII: the genocide committed against the Jewish people, the splitting of families, the confiscation of their properties, the young couple escaping Nazi held territory by a razor thin margin left me breathless with dread and anticipation. That, of course, brilliantly set us up for the trial which granted Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren) the right to claim back this family treasure--so much so that the entire audience broke out into enthusiastic applause. Artfully and masterfully done. Was it worth it all in the end. You be the judge."
" Because no crime is too small
",-0.6908,0.6006,2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"I love art & even though, it isn't a masterpiece like the titular painting, it's still a good movie. The only drawbacks are that the movie is 15 minutes too long & a bit overtly sentimental (but that you can excuse, considering the subject matter).
Now the good stuff:
1. The initial scene which shows Klimt painting the 'Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer'. The whole thing is so good: the intriguing painting technique, the consummate painter, the luminous model, the necklace, the ambience, the light, the music, etc. For just a little while, this scene transported me into the room like an eavesdropper & made me feel like great art was being made right before my own eyes.
2. The background music, the beautiful photography, the perfect sets & the sensitive portrayals by all the actors involved.
3. The bonding scenes between Altmann & her lawyer.
4. The scene when the lawyer breaks down upon his visit to the holocaust memorial & the one where he confesses brokenly to his wife that he only went for the money.
5. The scene where Altmann says that when people see the painting, they see the work of a great painter but she sees her aunt.
6. The holocaust had devastating consequences, especially for the jews. So, even though it's based on real life events, I was intrigued to see how this movie in particular, which was based on far less sinister aspects of holocaust (that of the theft of a few paintings & belongings), was going to appeal to the audiences. However, this movie very effectively made me realize that theft is theft; be it of life, liberty, identity, dignity or of the things that we hold dear. And nobody has the right to steal anything from anybody even under the worst circumstances such as the dark cloud of holocaust looming over Europe, because no crime is too small.
For these, and many other good things, I liked the movie a lot!"

" Priceless
",0.0,0.9657,2020-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Another one of those infuriating yet inspiring true stories from history following Helen Mirren as an elderly Jewish woman in L.A . 'Maria' finds documents in her late sisters possessions proving that several priceless paintings stolen six decades earlier from her family during WW2 by the Nazis are now in the possession of a museum in Austria.With the help of ambitious young lawyer Ryan Reynolds Maria starts legal proceedings in various countries to recover a portrait of her beloved aunt known as the woman in gold, now considered a national treasure by the Austrian government.Enjoyed this movie, parts of it are done in flashbacks with the fantastic Tatiana Maslan playing a young Maria just as the Nazis are taking over Austria and rounding up the Jews. Helen Mirren is brilliant as expected. Ryan Reynolds role could have been played by anyone and he wasn't notable at all."
" Slow-moving but thought-provoking drama
",0.0,0.8108,2019-11-18 00:00:00,7,"An Austrian refugee (Maria Altmann, played by Helen Mirren) engages a lawyer to help her recover artwork (including Gustav Klimt's iconic ""Woman in Gold"" (Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I), allegedly stolen (directly) from her family by the Nazis, and later stolen (indirectly) by the famous Belvedere Museum in Vienna, The story is fascinating and, other than some gimmicky 'doorway into the past' scenes, the film is very well done. Mirren was quite good as the tetchy, elderly women who discovers that she might have a chance to undo an historic wrong. I was less impressed at Ryan Reynold's underdogish E. Randol Schoenberg. I don't recall any scene in the film in which the heroic lawyer's potential fee is discussed (but at 40% contingency, he made over $120 million dollars) and I'm not sure what would have happened if Altmann had decided not to sell the paintings. While, at least as I know the story, law and justice were on Altmann's side, I was still somewhat put off by the one-sidedness of the story: anyone who disagreed with Altmann or Schoenberg is presented as either a smarmy museum suit, a supercilious bureaucrat, or an anti-Semite. Over-all, a slow-moving but thought-provoking film about complicated legal and moral issues."
" Justice for the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer
",0.5267,0.9071,2019-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Woman in Gold, directed by Simon Curtis, is based on the true story of Jewish Holocaust survivor Maria Altmann as she fights nearly fifty years later to reclaim ownership of artwork that belonged to her family that was stolen by the Nazis during WWII. Helen Mirren turns in an outstanding portrayal of Maria in her later life; Tatiana Maslany does the same for Maria's years as a young woman fleeing her hometown of Vienna, Austria, when the Nazi regime threatened the survival of the Jews there.One of the many art pieces stolen from the Altmanns is a stunning Masterpiece by Gustav Klimt; the painting was dubbed the ""Mona Lisa of Austria."" Stolen by the Nazis in 1941, it had been displayed for decades at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.The original title of the piece, ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer,"" was of Maria's Aunt Adele who died of meningitis when she was forty-four. The portrait was one of two portraits of his wife commissioned of Klimt by Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. By 1900, Klimt was the most popular portrait painter of the wives of the Jewish Viennese bourgeoisie.In 1998 Hubertus Czernin, an Austrian investigative journalist, (played by Daniel Brühl), established that the Österreichische Galeri Belvedere contained several works stolen from Jewish owners in the war. The gallery refused to return the art to their original owners, or even to acknowledge the crimes. Maria discovered some letters after her sister's death that linked her family to this Nazi art theft.Enter Ryan Reynolds who turned in an excellent performance as young lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg, the son of a family friend of Maria's. Randy's grandfather was renowned Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg and his grandfather's music was featured in the film.At first Randy is reluctant to take the job, but once he makes an exploratory fact-finding trip to Vienna, he is on board. Ryan Reynolds and Dame Mirren have a convincing chemistry in this mystery / buddy picture.Randy tells Maria that she will have to speak at a meeting of the Reunification Commission about the paintings. She too is reluctant, but naturally, her speech is very moving. ""When you look at this painting,"" she says, ""you see a work of art. I see my aunt.""With the aid of Czernin, they are able to maneuver the bureaucratic obstacles thrown their way and bat their game to the finish line.The narrative flips back and fourth from past to the time of the current story, a technique I like. I thought the acting was the strongest part of the movie and the script was slowed down by exposition. If you're interested in this important topic, or want to see Helen Mirren in a stellar performance, with impressive work form the cast, I recommend it.The way I came to the film was that I recently watched The Art Dealer, (L'Antiquaire), by filmmaker François Margolin, which also dealt with Nazi theft of Jewish artwork. I was keen to see more films on this topic.Last week I did a bit of genealogy research on the ancestry site Geni. com when I noticed a Jewish History project. One of the women featured in the project caught my eye because I know her and the photo that was up of her was not the correct person with that name. I found a photo of her, replaced the erroneous one, and shot the curator Randy Schoenberg a quick note to tell him what I did. He wrote back, ""Thank you.""Curious, I searched his name online and was led to a Wikipedia page about him. There I discovered that Randy Schoenberg is a U.S. attorney and genealogist, who specializes in legal cases related to the recovery of looted or stolen artworks, particularly those by the Nazi regime during the Holocaust.""Schoenberg,"" Wikipedia says, ""is widely known as one of the central figures of the 2015 film Woman in Gold, which depicted the case of Maria Altmann against the government of Austria. Schoenberg is portrayed by Ryan Reynolds.""Boom. I had my next film to watch. I also joined Randy's Jewish Genealogy group on Fb. This week, Randy mentioned a name of one of his ancestors that is the same name as one of my great-grandfathers. I asked a cousin if she thought we might be related, but she said no.I wanted to know what became of the ""Mona Lisa of Austria,"" so I looked it up and found this, ""In 2006, following eight years of effort by the Bloch-Bauer heirs, the painting was returned to the family; it was sold the same year for $135 million, at the time a record price for a painting. Since July 13, 2006, the painting has been on public display in the Neue Galerie in New York City.""Harvey Weinstein was a producer of this film and I felt loathe to see it because of the connection with him."

" Lots of Things Covered But Works Effectively
",0.5927,0.8926,2019-08-20 00:00:00,8,"""Woman in Gold"" is a mixture of courtroom drama and a tale of Holocaust survival,but an intriguing journey of etching through the trenches of WWII and an odd couple seeking justice starring Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds.After the war ended, it was time for people to settle in and restore the heartbreak and injustices that took place in the six years that caused trauma, tragedy lost loved ones and to rebuild a new life for the citizens who survived and the next generation to come. Even though a lot has been forgiven, there is still events that will never be forgotten. Their anecdotes will exhibited in museums, taught in schools and read in books. And even in today's society, there are things that haven't been fully revived. To this day, families who been affected by the Holocaust are still in demand to restore things that have been lost and will never stop until justice is served. Many of these relics, artifacts and personal property have never been returned to their personal owners. Many of these treasures include paintings that were placed in museums and art galleries. While others are still in possession just waiting to be claimed. ""Woman in Gold"" is the true story of an elderly lady who wants to return the titular portrait back to her family, though it's no easy task since it's been stored in an Austrian museum.Helen Mirren stars as Maria Altmann. a Jewish Holocaust survivor. She and her husband narrowly escape Nazi-occupied Austria, abandoning her parents while migrating to the United States. Her family were aficionados in the world of art. Her uncle sponsored paintings from Gustav Klimt who had a painting of his wife who died before the invasion commenced. The Nazis confiscated every precious belongings that her family owned, a lot of them were pretty expensive too.Her aunt's portrait is now resting at the Belvedere Museum where it is being dubbed as ""The Lady in Gold"". Several decades later, Maria wants to reclaim so her hires a friend's son who was a lawyer named Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) to take it to court in order to win it back.Though there are scenes told in flashbacks about the horrific events that took place in WWII and though there is a plethora of ground to be covered, it is still a courtroom drama. Many justices of the law were on hand during this trial and lots of documents had to be in order for them to win their case. And though several decades younger than Maria, Randy's heartbreaks come through the stories his grandparents endured while Maria saw Hitler's evil ways from an eye's view. Randy is joined by an Austrian journalist name Hubertus Czernin (Daniel Bruhl) who arbitrarily offers his service knowing full well about his family's bad legacy. The flashbacks reflect upon a young Maria through good times and bad ones and are used to great effect especially where her court battle marks her return to her country that she abandoned decades ago.We can always depend on Mirren to deliver a great performance and her accent was spot on. The odd pairing she has with Reynolds seems natural more like a mother/son relationship over a lawyer/client relationship. Reynolds really played the lawyer like he was a professional lawyer. Tatiana Maslany shows her inner ""Orphan Black"" character as the younger Maria as she's on the run constantly. Her emotions were priceless. Sure a lot of material is covered in ""Woman in Gold"", but everything falls into place."

Mirren as usual is the Queen of all she surveys. How do you solve a problem like Maria? was a famous song in fellow Austrian film The Sound of Music. The question is answered throughout the movie!A film that's only weakness is the inevitable ending. More inevitable than a boxing film.Featuring an excellent cast including Ryan Reynolds as financially burdened lawyer Randy Schoenberg, Austrian Daniel Bruhl and Charles Dance as his usual dour self.The Vienna locations can't fail to disappoint."
" I HAVE DECIDED TO FACE THE GHOSTS
",0.0,0.9847,2019-06-26 00:00:00,10,"The film is a drama based on a true story which effectively utilizes flashbacks to create a bitter-sweet historic feeling. Maria Altman (Helen Mirren) is a WWII Jewish escapee from Austria. Her family was well off and part of the intellectual crowd and was able to commission a number of paintings, among which was the ""Woman in Gold"" a painting of her aunt. She utilizes US attorney Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) a grandson of a friend of the family whose roots are also in Vienna.Maria just doesn't want any painting, but one that is considered the ""Mona Lisa"" of Austria, the pride and joy of their art world. A woman who looks sad while dressed in gold. Some speculate she was having an affair with Klimt, the artist. She couldn't have children and was unable to pursue the intellectual position she desired. It is a portrait of a woman who has all the wealth she desires, but is unhappy because of her status. Okay that's my take.Helen Mirren gave her typically fine performance. Ryan Reynolds was less impressive and Katie Holmes managed to land herself another background wife role.Guide: 1 F-bomb. Otherwise benign."
" Brilliant tale of a woman's journey to obtaining her family portraits back to the states
",0.5859,0.9286,2019-06-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie was such an emotional and a fascinating watch to think a woman who was lucky enough to escape the war with her husband to America and decades later, was able to get her families paintings back from the Nazis (as well as from the Austrian government). This way, she was able to bring the paintings back with her to America and get justice.Kudos for Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds for teaming up on this historical film like it was such a rollercoaster watching it but with an inspiring happy ending!"

This is another example of how wrong I was. As long as the past lives in peoples memory, it must be honoured.No matter what you think about the past, this is a wonderful film about human nature. The culture clash between an American lawyer who initially sees money, then sees family and culture, is handled very well.Watch and enjoy."
" Great work!
",0.6588,0.9918,2019-04-27 00:00:00,9,"Helen Mirren, the film protagonist, proved that she is an exceptional actress. She truly served her role and her acting was so convincing it almost felt like you were watching scenes from your daily life. Ryan Reynolds also played very well and they both made a rather special but successful duet.As for the plot, it is very interesting, unpredictable and it addresses a very touching and modern historical fact. I assure those who hated history class back in school (me included) , it's nothing like that, but much better. It only has the captivating and educational aspect of it.Finally, the director, producers, costume designers etc also did a great job.

What makes the film so compelling is that it shows History as it happened .
It also sets the record straight about how Austrians were happy to welcome the Nazis all those years ago.
But more than this, it is filmed as a thriller diving into History, spiced up with a bit of courtroom drama.
The actors are all incredible. Helen Mirren is not a surprise, she is excellent in everything she does ( you could put a sac of potatoes over her head and she would still be convincing ) but Ryan Reynolds is so good in portraying this young lawyer in for the money who comes to realize that he is fighting for his family too, that he moved me to tears.
Those two fought against a brick wall and bit by bit achieved to destroy it.

He is the grandson of the Austrian-Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg, who also fled the Nazis.I liked the film, which received mixed reviews. There are a few annoying cliches, particularly in the relationship between the young lawyer and his wife. Some reviewers said the film was a dull movie about a fascinating true story, but I didn't find it dull at all. Helen Mirren was excellent as the lead, Maria Altmann, who died in Los Angeles in 2011 at the age of 94. The title painting now hangs in the Neue Galerie in New York City."
" Justice is a masterpiece
",0.8176,0.9973,2018-08-24 00:00:00,8,"The movie - based on a true story - is about a woman named Maria Altman - played by Academy Award winner Helen Mirren - whose painting of her aunt was taken by the Nazis in World War II. She hires Randy Schoenberg (Golden Globe Nominee Ryan Reynolds) to help in her battle. Not only was this a battle for what belonged in her family for centuries, but it was a crusade for justice of yet another crime perpetrated by the Nazis.While this got mixed reviews from the critics, I personally thought that this was a beautiful movie that was elevated by the performance from its two leads. Helen Mirren is always a sight to behold in each of her movies and her performance here brings a sort of history to the movie, as we are reminded once again of the crimes that the Nazis have done (and I'm not just talking about the artwork). Ryan Reynolds is always fun to watch, but here he downplays the comedic persona for something a little more serious and it surprisingly fit him like a glove! Even in some of his more serious movies, he had a bit of comedic charm to him, so it was nice to see him go way more dramatic in this role. The supporting actors are all good as well. Katie Holmes did a good job as the wife that Reynolds is supporting (thus being a big reason as to why he's taking on the case), Golden Globe Nominee Daniel Bruhl is always a talented actor no matter what he does, and Golden Globe Nominee Tatiana Maslany does a great job in portraying a younger version of Helen Mirren.Overall, go and see this movie! It may seem a bit cheesy at times, but the actors all bring life to an interesting subject, particularly Mirren and Reynolds. It's a great film; don't miss it!"

Let's be honest, he'd be more believable as the poster boy for the Hitler youth movement than as his role playing the Jewish attorney Randy Schoenberg. I'm not suggesting that you have a Jew play a Jew, but Reynolds was so out of character that in my opinion it detracted from the film. Perhaps they thought by have Reynold's as the male lead, they'd attract a larger audience. I guess we'll never know one way or the other."

" Compelling, convincing presentation of a shockingly-irresistible true story
",0.7506,0.9972,2017-11-14 00:00:00,10,"Lovers of the art that is film sometimes tend (or even wish) to play down the irreducible fact that ""having a good story to tell"" is part of the deal.In ""Woman in Gold"" from British Director Simon Curtis, the story resembles that of several family histories present in the superb genealogy documentary ""Who do You Think You Are?"" in that we move backwards and forwards - in just a step or two - from the world we know (Los Angeles and Vienna in the 1990s and early 2000s) to the world of a 1938 Austria in which people line the streets to welcome and cheer on Hitler's Anschluss and watch enthusiastically as poor Jews in the streets have their pigtails and beards cut off for humiliation purposes.And, while much of the Fuhrer's Berlin was pounded to rubble, in parts of Vienna you actually can go back to blocks of flats once inhabited by Jewish people the Nazis exterminated.Here a splendid Helen Mirren portrays Maria Altmann, who could also (though was in fact phobically reluctant to) go back to her childhood home in Vienna seized without mercy and never returned. At an early stage, Mirren's Altmann reminds us that 50 years is not actually that long a period...In fact, Maria's life stood out just a little from those of celebrities featured in ""Who do You Think You Are?"" in that she was among several members of her family to survive the Holocaust - as opposed to the typical situation of being the only one, or at least a descendant of the only one. While Jews rich and poor died, Maria's family had been very well-to-do, and her sugar-manufacturing uncle was astute and influential enough to get out of Vienna quickly. But naturally enough, he had limited capacity to take away property including the titular subject of this movie, the Gustav Klimt painting of Maria's Aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer, which the Austrian state ""acquired"" smoothly enough post-War (as the country began the process of portraying itself as a victim of Hitler's aggression); this work of art resembling so many others in having been stolen by the Nazis from Jews they were about to cart off and kill.Ironically, perhaps, Klimt was not a particular favourite for the Nazis, being regarded as at least semi-""degenerate"". Had it been fully so the painting might have been summarily destroyed. Equally, had it been fully acceptable, it would doubtless have left Vienna for the Fatherland rapidly enough, as did several other treasures of Maria's family.And so to the main story, in which Ryan Reynolds plays lawyer Randy Schoenberg - a junior branch of a family also in Maria's circle of Austrian-Jewish escapees, and in fact a grandson of the famous Arnold - a composer unreservedly deemed ""degenerate"" by the Nazis, who escaped to the US as early as in 1934, only dying in LA in 1951.In the film - as in life - it is Randy's job to persuade the Austrian authorities - and above all people - that art acquired in the above way cannot in good conscience go on hanging on the walls of the Belvedere Gallery as ""Austria's Mona Lisa"".Sounds reasonable enough, right? Well, in fact, Maria and Randy had a 6-year legal battle on their hands which faced stubborn resistance from Austria. Revindication had only come on to the agenda at all thanks to a 1998 Act pushed for by Nazi-hunter journalist Hubertus Czernin - as superbly played in the film by Daniel Bruhl.It would be easy to imagine that a story of this kind cannot be messed up in film form, but that would be too optimistic. Many such films are indeed messed up, for example by caricature good guys and bad guys speaking English ""viz a strong Jarman exent"". Here authentic German is resorted to and everything looks and feels right (which in the context of the story sometimes means ""very wrong""). Mirren does her job well, naturally, but her pairing with Reynolds is excellent and the development of Maria and Randy's relationship also a joy. When Bruhl joins them from time to time it just gets even better.On the whole, the film is also understated, which here is good. But it gives us a hint of the richness of the Jewish culture in old Vienna - most especially when Maria's wedding is portrayed - and this is as fascinating as it is moving and tragic, given the infinite evil soon deployed against it.In essence, then, a remarkable and important story recreated perfectly.It's a story all need to know, with an ending of victory and a hint of happiness, albeit muted - as Mirren's Altmann makes clear. But this educational process is also a great cinematic experience - a must-watch indeed."
" Solid Dramatic Biopic Worth your Time
",0.3612,0.9993,2017-11-01 00:00:00,8,"""When people see the famous portrait, they see a masterpiece by one of Austria's finest artists. But I see a picture of my aunt, a woman who talked to me about life while I brushed her hair in her bedroom."" Truer and more earnest words could not have been spoken better than that of Austrian- Jewish holocaust survivor, Maria Altmann, known for successfully reclaiming some of her family paintings from the Austrian Government that were abducted by the Nazis. Today's film tackles that subject, and upon viewing it for the first time, it managed to speak above higher levels of sincerity and personal attachment that I don't see often in cinema.The first notable element that the film portrays beautifully is the character of Maria Altmann herself. Growing up as a child in the mid-20s, she saw her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer being used to create the grim yet beauteous woman in the portrait known as Woman in Gold. Adele had a few portraits made of her by Austrian symbolist painter Gustav Klimt at age 25 through negotiations by her husband. Considering how much the portrait of her aunt meant to Maria personally, it makes sense that she would feel disgusted to see how this painting was used in later years. In fact, throughout the film, we see flashbacks of Maria's childhood that perfectly immolates her lifespan from childhood to young adulthood. Given how close Maria felt to her aunt as elegantly displayed in these flashbacks, this makes the symbolism of the gold painting all the more powerful. Klimt's intention was to showcase a ""swirling gown within a blaze of gold rectangles, spirals and Egyptian symbols"", creating her aunt as the personification of Vienna's Golden Age. After her aunt died, the family would look upon the paintings through divineness, leaving Maria only with memories of the paintings, before they were taken away. This is what presents the ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"" as a symbol of all that her family had lost.One aspect that the film never shies away from is the horrible treatment of European Jews. As mentioned before, the film often depicts flashbacks of Maria's struggles in Austria. Not just the treatment of ""inferior"" people, but by also demonstrating Nazis taking family possessions away from their original owners and would never have them restored. Maria's story compliments this unfortunate event, but the idea that it's best to let go of the past plays a notable contrast, despite how unjustified the act was. Sure, those who may not have been affected by it could still feel sorry for such a tragedy, but the ones who had a piece of them taken away by their foes just adds into how much of a double-edged sword the justice behind this act really is.Adding on to the well personified protagonist, the acting is also spot on. Helen Mirren is able to showcase the guilt hidden in Maria from how she abandoned her family to live a safer life, and is excellent at presenting her conflicted soul. She perfectly understood how Maria was tangled up between the past and the need to move on, elevated with tough emotions. Ryan Reynolds may be praised for Deadpool nowadays, but he is able to personify lawyer Randy Schoenburg (grandson of composer Arnold Schoeburg) as a young persistent lawyer extraordinarily. As a struggling family man with strong conviction for his roots, Reynolds leaps his persona to whole new heights as a determined lawyer in getting justice back to the right person.Similar to Big Eyes, the supporting cast either come off as obstacles or supporters in the protagonist's determination to gain their rightfully owned possessions back. Some like Hubertnus Czernin and Pam Schoenburg do support the duo in their court cases and battles against false copyright claims as well as giving some insight on their own pasts. Others, on the other hand, like Dr. Dreimann, Rudolph Wran, and those in favor of the Austrian government are highly intelligent and guarded civilians who have to deal with someone wanting back a possession which is also a legendary piece of their motherland. Not to mention, the court room scenes are at their most complex, especially in how Randy exercises in ownership loopholes and fighting against claims of the 1976 copyright act.Now the story itself does fall a little derivative with the two main leads conflicting with one another throughout before officially teaming up. Yet as overused as it seems, it actually helps give Randy a clear purpose to aid Maria given how much he cares about the identity of his own people as much as hers. Along with the gut-wrenching drama, the film occasionally sneaks in some subtle humor for good measure. Even if this was to keep the horrid trauma from what it truly was in real life, it gives off a more relatable vibe with the story and characters for the audience. Finally, the use of grim cinematography during the flashbacks fits perfectly with the time period to create the right sense of depression in contrast to the brighter cinematography of Altmann's court cases in '99.With sharp acting, well defined characters, and perfect contrast between the past and future, Woman in Gold is such remarkable insight on a fascinating woman who fought the law to gain her rightfully owned possessions back. The film actually ends with a quote that states, ""It has been estimated that over 100'000 works of art taken by the Nazis have not been returned to their rightful owners"". That quote only makes Maria's success all the more unique seeing as how much that piece meant to her, even if it meant taking a historic piece of art away from Austria. While some may not know of the actual history, this motion picture manages to stay true to the facts, and would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to see an underdog story about gaining one's memories back."
" For a certain audience
",0.2732,0.8827,2017-08-21 00:00:00,3,"Woman in Gold is based upon true events telling a supposed true based story. These biopic films are most definitely difficult at relating towards and often times enjoying, if we are interested in the story it tells. This film is more so centered towards a certain audience, but overall this film is more so dull and boring at times than it is enjoyable and interesting. Good performances from the leads but far too many flashback scenes that take up space from the movie. For a true story with an interesting premise, Woman in Gold is rather dull and forgettable."
" Excellent Movie. Helen Mirren is, as always, super.
",0.8225,0.8885,2017-06-20 00:00:00,10,"The true story on which this movie is based is, per se, a moving plot about how bureaucratic power is exerted, having as background the dispute of a Klimt painting robbed by the Nazis during WWII and kept by an Austrian museum. Along those lines, there is a love story treated with restrained direction and editing.Plot, actors, director and all the specialized movie work is tops on this subdued (is it a good choice for American audiences?) movie available at Netflix."
" A superb movie, must see.
",0.6249,0.8571,2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,"The script was just enough-- pure distilled perfection.Its a nice simple story that you can follow. This is remarkable since there are flashbacks throughout.The writer, director or cinematographer is a genius or all of them. The old faded picture segue to a moving picture. The flashback characters materialize in the modern cafe. The students in the background of the art museum. Going to the men's room to lose composure. Driving through the yellow traffic light. Judicious gingerly use of profanity. The splitting the goodbye scene with her parents for maximum impact at the end. Conflating present and past in end scene in her house was a genius use of the actors and setups. Her being an amateur before the local court-- him with the Supreme Court.It was riveting, they wove a thriller into a drama. It showed the banality of evil, taking brothers off the plane. Mirren, what more needs to be said? It was like Amistad, that we have to honor our ancestors.What an uplifting story, and one you should not miss."
" Worthy but Wordy
",0.2382,0.9473,2017-05-17 00:00:00,5,"The ""Woman in Gold"" of the title is a painting, Gustav Klimt's ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I"". (That Roman numeral was added to distinguish it from a second portrait of the same woman). Frau Bloch-Bauer was a beautiful young society lady from a wealthy Viennese Jewish family. She herself died in 1925, but the picture remained in the possession of her family until it was seized by the Nazis following the Anschluss of 1938. Klimt was not the Nazis' favourite artist- he was too modernistic for Hitler's ultra-conservative tastes- but he was not Jewish and was never officially condemned as ""degenerate"", so there was no ban on the public display of his art. In 1941 the painting was acquired by the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna where it hung for many years. (The Nazis were embarrassed by the fact that Klimt's sitter had been Jewish, so the name of the painting was changed to ""Woman in Gold""). In 1998, however, Adele's last surviving relative, her niece Maria Altmann, now living in Los Angeles, began a legal fight to recover the stolen painting.The Austrian government resisted the claim doggedly, basing their opposition on the fact that in her will Adele had expressed the wish that the painting should hang in the Belvedere. There were, however, two problems with their defence. The first was that Adele had wished that the picture should only go to the Belvedere after the death of her husband Ferdinand, who was still alive in 1941. The second, and more serious, objection was that the painting was not actually Adele's to dispose of- it was legally Ferdinand's property, not hers.The film is based on the true story of this legal battle, concentrating on the relationship between Maria and her young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg. The two had a lot in common, both being descended from the cultured, intellectual Jewish haute bourgeoisie of Vienna. They shared a love of music; Randy was the grandson of the famous composer, Arnold Schoenberg, and Maria's late husband, Fritz, had been an opera singer. Intercut with the legal action are scenes showing Maria's early life and her flight from Vienna to escape from the Nazis in 1938.I watched this film when it was recently shown in television, partly because I am an art lover and partly because of my respect for Helen Mirren, but in many way it proved a disappointment. Mirren as Maria Altmann was certainly good, as she normally is, but she was about the only good thing in this film. There have been many excellent films based upon court cases, but such courtroom dramas have nearly all been about criminal trials, focussing on conflicting evidence and dramatic scenes of cross-examination in the witness-box. Civil actions, which rely more on legal argument and precedents and which may not even involve any testimony from live witnesses, rarely make for such engrossing drama.The case of Republic of Austria v. Altmann does not prove an exception to the rule. The lengthy scenes of discussions and legal arguments are worthy but wordy, and the flashbacks to the 1930s (for some reason shot in a very dull, muted colour) do not provide much relief from the tedium. (We know from the beginning that Maria will survive, so there is little tension). The story of the wholesale looting of European art by the Nazis, of the legal fight for restitution and of the various moral issues involved is a potentially fascinating one; it deserved a better cinematic treatment than this. 5/10"
" I lose any faith in professional critics
",-0.2732,-0.8426,2017-05-14 00:00:00,10,"As one or two other non-professional reviewers have said, I just don't understand the many negative reviews from the professionals. As a Jew, I found the film totally gripping and beautifully done in every way. The film is grounded in the Holocaust and faithfully portrays the vicious treatment of Jews by the Austrian people as well as the Nazis. The later intransigent attitude of the Austrian authorities who will do anything to hang on to the stolen painting should come as no surprise. Austria has never admitted its culpability in the Nazi atrocities and never will, unlike Germany.I have substantial doubts about the sensitivity of these negative reviewers to the plight of the Jews at that time. Their childish complaint seems to be that the film isn't exciting enough and is schmaltzy. I found it gripping and truthful."
" I give it a Bronze!
",0.0,0.9883,2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"The true-story based drama ""Woman in Gold"" did not deserve any gold medals, but was bronzely deserved as solid cinematic offering. Helen Mirren stars as Maria Altmann, an older woman who was a Jewish refugee in her homeland of Austria. Her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer sang the original version of Adele's ""Hello""; not even Lionel Richie sang it better! Hello! Hello! Are you still there? Please don't say goodbye yet to my review of ""Woman in Gold"". In all seriousness, Adele Bloch- Bauer was the subject of an infamous painting during the 1940's. However, that painting and much artwork of Maria's family was seized by the Nazis in Germany-occupied Austria. During the late 1990's after a few occurrences including a deep letter from her deceased aunt Adele, Maria decides that it's time to get what is rightfully hers; most notably the startling ""Woman in Gold"" painting, in that time displayed in an Austrian museum. So Maria hires a nice young Jewish lawyer named Randy Schoenberg, and their fight for art-recovery justice is in full plight as they tackle many obstacles, most notably the Austrian government, to recover to Maria what is rightfully hers. Director Simon Curtis does hold par in his orchestration of the picture, even though Simon says way too many times what is obvious. Alexi Kaye Campbell's screenplay was moderate at best, but shined brightly within Maria's charismatic dialogue. Helen Mirren did shine with a golden performance as Maria, and Ryan Reynolds deserved a silver-thespian medal with his work as Randy Schoenberg. ""Woman in Gold"" does paint a pretty picture on art justice, and though not perfect, still deserves a look. *** Average"
" A great film that fell through the cracks
",0.6249,0.9874,2017-02-23 00:00:00,9,"My original perception was that this was an indie flick that only played in the art houses because it was an artsy film. the truth is that it's a great film that simply didn't get the luck of the draw when it came with mass distribution. Woman in Gold would be at home with any of the Oscar nominees and contenders and would easily be considered more of an outright crowd pleaser than a film like Danish Girl (which got nominated in acting categories) or Brooklyn (which did make the final cut for Oscar). The film is based on an eight-year-long quest by a California-based lawyer of Austrian descent and a longtime family friend from the motherland (the prior relationship between the characters is erased in the adaptation process) to reclaim confiscated art by the Nazis. The film's main strength is that it's neither a holocaust story nor is it a standard courtroom drama, but it's a fresh new take on both genres. As for the former, the film feels fresh through its specificity to the Austrian experience and the specificity of a wealthy family. The film is more relatable to the experience of anyone descended of an immigrant who had to leave the old regime. As for the latter, the film's main challenge wasn't showing a guy having his flashy day in court but rather a long slog as it was taking a toll on his life. The film handles this challenge in pacing admirably. More than that, the film flies on the strength of its central relationship. You never think of Ryan Reynolds (best known for subversive leading men or a smug action stars) and Helen Mirren as occupying the same universe but the chemistry between the two goes a long way towards making this film transformative. The film is a powerful one about remembrance and loss. It teaches that one can't fix the past, but healing those wounds is a noble cause."
" A Fascinating Case--Movie a Bit Bland
",0.5423,0.9935,2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"I have to say that I enjoyed this film, but mostly for the subject matter, a court case that took place in 1998. We have for some time been made aware again of the Nazi's efforts to steal the great art of the world, particularly Western art. Movies like ""The Monument Men"" depict efforts to recover what they stole from the heart of the world. For this they can never be forgiven. The majority of these pieces have never been found. Fortunately, many of the works were kept in museums or in private residences and so were intact. This is the story of a piece that became known as the Austrian Mona Lisa. Helen Mirren is Maria Altman whose family owned the great portrait known as the Woman in Gold. When she finds some letters that tell of the story of the painting, she enlists a young Randy Schoenberg, the grandson of the great composer, to make a case for the return of the painting to its rightful heirs. Predictably, they wade through all the roadblocks, assisted by a young Austrian journalist. I have to agree with the reviews that talk about the good guys and the bad guys. I love Austria, especially Vienna, but here they are portrayed so harshly that we have little sympathy for their position. Ryan Reynolds is a little short on effort here, sort of phoning it in. But there are enough twists and turns and Mirren is great fun to watch to make it well worthwhile. I plan on seeing how realistic the portrayal was."
