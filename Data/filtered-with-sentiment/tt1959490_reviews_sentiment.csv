" Wouldn't waste my time
",0.3252,0.8213,2021-04-05 00:00:00,4,This is an alright movie but it steers pretty far from the Bible. There are some things that steer away from what the Bible has and makes Noah look ruthless. It's not horrible but I wouldn't say worth the time.

Racism in Hollywood laid bare in the fact that they didn't hire a diverse main cast.Even Noah should be like a mixed-race Moroccan, South African or someone which shows the possibility of diversity in his appearance.

This is not a movie that remains faithful to the Bible account at all, so look elsewhere if you want that. This is just fiction and heresy, from a Christian POV. Also, I'm pretty sure Noah and his entire family weren't super white. I'm serious, they chose the whitest actors they could find, lol. It seems like they did that on purpose for some odd reason which I'm not going to bother figuring out. I am a conservative white person and even I know and admit that most characters in the Bible were brown or tan (Middle Eastern), albeit some were also quite fair."
" Nearly

Nearly blockbuster.'Noah' the ""nearly"" film offers plenty but clinches very little.I found the actors mainly sub-par and insufficiently directed resulting in oddly uncoordinated performances that didn't marry together: neither between characters nor over the course of any single characters development.The mixed up styles and tone sometimes produced a storytelling idea or a visual design that was worth all the trouble but usually a nagging blockbuster-ness or a character flatness, or both, intervened to drive out the better quality element of 'Noah'.The special effects are mainly, but not always, disappointing and the costumes and props similarly so. The sound design is altogether un-enhancing to the onscreen profferings.I rate a 5/10 and I think that fans of the director will enjoy checking this out more than fans of any principle cast member or a general film watcher will and I recommend accordingly; simply put, a lot of effort has clearly been put into making 'Noah' and all that effort has produced a film that I am happy to have seen but I'm not convinced that the overall effect is that valuable."

Not even the bible.I enjoyed the film. I enjoyed it until there was 50 minutes left until the bad guy which is the king invaded the ark without noah knowing and started eating their animals.I also disliked that noah refused one of his sons attempt to tried to bring one girl to the ark with him so that he could marry her etc etc.I also disliked that the film is showing Noah as a bit stubborn and ignorant. The show made the character say if if I had a granddaughter I would kill her if I had a grandson i would keep him. (And then he did not kill them) (but still only saying it is bad)"
" Bathgate no Noah, Linwood no Noah....
",-0.5267,-0.5029,2020-10-21 00:00:00,7,"So not being overly familiar with the Bible and all that comes with it i came into this without prejudice. It's a good film, How accurately it conforms to the Old Testament and what not, i don't know and don't really care.
It's a strong cast overall and the acting in the main is up to that standard. Sir Tony, even though he's not got much screen time is his usual exceptional self, Russell Crowe too gives a brilliant performance battling with his minds demons for a a great part of the film. Even Cockney Geezah Ray Winston gives a decent performance. Indeed, i would say the weakest link is Emma Watson who rarely changes expression from that by now familiar almost glazed over face she pulls in any part i've seen her in. You know the one, it's that mix of pained, perplexed, permanently constipated and deep in thought all rolled into one package. I honestly think she's a terrible actress who always seems to be trying way to hard, yet graduated from the Joey Tribiani school of acting.This is, though, a good film, i enjoyed it, though i felt the costume design was wrong for the age that these events are alleged to have taken place. I'm not a massive fan of trying to modernise the aesthetics of 'historic' films."

I was totally disappointed in no animals, and glad I didnt show my grandchildren this movie, as I would have built it up based on seeing pairs of creatures being saved from the flood.. If you can get past the lack of creatures, not a bad movie. Ray Winstone and Sir Anthony Hopkins are always great. Very strange slant on a biblical story."
" Pretty Great
",0.8074,0.9927,2020-09-14 00:00:00,8,"Don't get the hate for starters. I imagine its because this movie can be polarizing depending on religious views but has a fair amount of action and drama. We all know this biblical story. Painted on our childrens' bedroom walls, crafted into music boxes, even interesting spin offs. This immediately gives some flesh and bone to Noah. Not an absolute hero either. Sort of the anti-hero. A man more than anything. Doesn't know exactly what to do but trusting in himself, his family, and the Creator. Great performances from the likes of Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Russell Crowe, Emma Watson, and Logan Lerman. The movie gives us that timeless feeling, and unique cinematography only from Aronofsky, with gnostic and evolutionist views thrown in the mix, to create a beautiful film. Even the Watchers (which are apparently in the bible? who knew?) are delightful to watch and enjoy. A great adaptation to a very minimalistic story."

I wonder what Bible, if any they used, or did they just concoct some story and call it Noah. At least read the scriptures and try and tell the truth. This film is ignorant and based on someone's delusion, but not God's. Foolishness!"
" This is Noah's Ark - Not Harry Potter
",0.0,0.9919,2020-08-26 00:00:00,1,"A lot of people have posted on here that this is a great movie. But they are either just ignorant, or trolling. This movie is crap for too many reasons to list, but I will give three.1.) Virtually everyone that said they liked this movie, was not very familiar with the original (e.g. ignorant). Whether you believe in the Bible or not, the original story was not even close to this 'adaptation'. Aside from the names, this story missed everything else, including the main plot of the story (good vs. evil) and the moral of the story. It would be like making an adaptation of Star Wars, and putting the Starship Enterprise in it. Yeah, they are both space related genres. But they are contradictory to each other. The same with this film. They added science and scientists to a time-period that would not have this, took out all the villians from the original (Nephilim), and changed some of the good people in the original story (heros) into villains.2.) The acting was mediocre at best. Twice, you could see 'Noah' actually trying to remember his line, with an obvious scene cut. The three sons were simply horrible, and try your best, you could not build an emotional attachment to them.3.) Why someone hasn't mentioned the horrendous sound/audio to this yet (that I seen), is beyond me. The choice of music was like nails on a chalkboard, and it sounded like the entire movie was recorded on 1980's Radio Shack cassette recorder. I mean, it was that horrible.FINAL THOUGHTS: If you are going to make an adaptation/remake of a movie, there are certain lines you should never cross. At the very least, the general theme should remain intact, unless there is a clever twist (there wasn't). Otherwise, just make a movie called ""Bob's Ark"" and do whatever you want. Not bait-title people into watching something that it ain't.Considering the bad effects and sound for this, the only real value that could come from this movie is if they ever made a MST3K episode of it. Other than that, it isn't worth the hard-drive space on whatever server it resides on (imho)"
" Didn't like casting and costumes.
",-0.2755,0.8555,2020-08-24 00:00:00,3,"As most people have said everything, I all have to day is that the casting should be different. And something important. After all this time at sea, the characters have perfect shampoo washed hair and perfect makeup. Oh, and they wear pants. Yes pants, both men and women. Finally Noah appears overweight. Which was something extremely rare back then, especially on a ship."

" Biblical account lost in flood
",-0.3182,-0.9052,2020-08-04 00:00:00,1,I watched in shocked disbelief the scenes of Noah and the fanciful extra-biblical characters. The story is so well known from the judeo-christian tradition that messing with it is immediately recognizable.Where do I start? How about those Rock ents? Voices and characters stolen from The Lord of the Rings. How about the children and their wives? the Bible is absolutely clear that all the boys had wives when they entered the ark and when they left it. What about the stowaway? There was no stowaway on the ark that's recorded in the story.The thing is all of these items are well known. Nobody's fooled here into thinking that that's the way it might have gone down. It's just wrong wrong wrong!Couldn't finish this stinker.
" Noah
",0.0,0.8671,2020-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Expecting very little. Actually Noah was nowhere near as bad as heard, and while very flawed and by far the worst film of Darren Aronofsky(with his others ranging from very good to outstanding) it did have some impressive things. On the most part the film is brilliant visually, the barren apocalyptic landscapes and later more colourful ones were really striking and the cinematography has a sweeping yet somewhat surrealistic effect. The opening and creation sequences were beautifully done with the latter quite harrowing without being too heavy-handed, and the flood scene was intense and jaw-dropping in spectacle."
" Beware of polarized reviews....
",0.0,0.8895,2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,"Lots of people are hating this movie for several reasons.... The majority of the negative reviews claim that the big problem is that the film strays too far away from the original text found in the Bible regarding Noah's Arc. Well, the reason for this is simple...The story of Noah's Arc in the Bible is a very short story.... I believe the story is roundabout 3-4 pages long, and that's it. Aronofsky had to make a full length movie with a running time clocking in at about two and a half hours. So, naturally, the majority of ""Noah"" has a lot of creative liscence over the elements necessary to create an entire film. This fact shows what an amazing imagination that Darren Aronofsky has.Also, from the negative reviews that I have read, for the most part, are written by angry Christians who are just flabbergasted with the artistic embellishments in the film that are definitely not written in the Bible.Long story short, if you truly love Darren Aronofsky's films, you will probably like the film. If you only want the straight story of Noah's Arc, stick with just reading the Bible.An average rating of ""5.7"" stars by the public is INCREDIBLY LOW for how good the film is. I am suggesting that you watch the film, at least one time. Just my two cents. Peace."
" Fantasy meets bible and doesn't work on either
",0.0,0.6204,2020-07-20 00:00:00,2,"I was incredibly disappointed with the movie. The special effects that so many people talk about may look interesting but the real disappointment is the lack of coherent narrative for the story. The producer/director seems to have got caught up in the special effects portion of the movie and forgotten the actual storyline. Someone mentioned that writer pulled information from gnostic and old Jewish mystic tales and the story actually looks like cross between Harry Potter, Transformers and Ben Hur. It just doesn't work. They used all sorts of mystic and weird ideas to hobble a story together that doesn't work on any level. Biblically it's completely off, morally it has nothing to add, and as any kind of romance or action movie it just leaves most of its viewers confused.Harry Potter movies are better and they suffered from the same issue. Too much emphasis of special effects and not enough on actual character development and story adherence."
" Weirdly incoherent but good despite this
",0.5023,0.9028,2020-07-12 00:00:00,6,"Fantasy based very loosely around the story of Noah and the flood from the bible. It's rather a strange mix of biblical story, morality tale, character play and fantasy action movie. Russell Crowe and the other actors generally do a great job, but I feel were let down by the movie's major flaw - it's incoherence. There are too many competing different vibes- littered with alternately clumsy or cheesy moments. So the experience is schizophrenic. Had they picked just one thematic type and stuck with it, it may have been much better, even great.. Nonetheless, if you go with it, it's very entertaining - even profound (when it's not being absurd). This may be a very different movie to the one that you're expecting. Worth a watch. but watch without preconceptions!"
" incorrect depiction of history

" Horrible directing and editing
",-0.5423,-0.7597,2020-07-08 00:00:00,5,"All the copious time-lapse filming and horrendous editing, coupled with the fact that they scored the best music during the building of the ark stupid decision and one of the reasons why this movie tanked at the box office. They didn't even show the ark hitting land! That alone could have been an epic scene where they emerge from the darkness to the light- with the sky opening up to a beautiful sunlight-such a failure for a potentially great movie. The director shouldn't make movies anymore imo since he has no idea how to structure scenes to evoke emotion at the right times. What a disappointment. And the song playing during the credits was AWFUL. I gave 'NOAH' 5 stars only for the acting- the rest of the movie was garbage."

Then I might not have hated it so much. Horrible writing, horrible plat, awful acting from some decent actors....What a mess."
" Typical anti religious idiots rating it low.
",-0.5267,0.0387,2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,I liked this film the first time around and I still do second time round.This film (and films if this ilk) will always get low ratings as humans are incapable of believing there's a bigger power than their selfish selves.It's Noah and although tells the famous story it does deviate in many places but the point is still in there as well. ie that there's a creator and he knew more than we did.Good film.

And it wasn't it was directed by Darren aronofsky whom I have never ever been a big fan of because his movies are very confusing and pretentious and the only movies I liked from him were black swan and the wrestler the other movies he made ( pi, requiem for a dream, the fountain) all crap and this one is as far as I'm concerned much worse than those pieces of crap and the worst part about the movie is aronofsky's directing it was really bad and another thing I really hate is how he put rock monsters in the movie really why would he do that there were no rock monsters in the Bible, stupid huh I don't know how they got the idea of putting them in the movie but it was a big mistake and this movie disrespects the book and is an insult to the Bible this is one ugly mess of a movie and it is a disgrace to the art of filmmaking and also an insult to cinema.it doesn't even deserve to exist and it was no wonder why it got banned in certain countries not only that but I think it should be banned worldwide not be shown anywhere the story is unrealistic and incoherent the acting was really bad, aronofsky's directing was really bad and the cinematography was really bad this film deserved razzie nominations in all of the categories especially worst director( aronofsky) worst screenplay (aronofsky, Handel) and worst screen combo ( the rock monsters) this is a large atrocity to cinema, a huge waste of russell Crowe's talent, the worst movie of 2014 and it is also the new plan 9 from outer spaceThis film also has an ending song that is bad and the song was mercy is by patti Smith I hated it and she did a poor job with singing the song for this film it was so depressingly bad she sung it like she was nervous of dying.and to the other cast members of the film to Logan lerman, to Jennifer connolly, to Douglas booth, to ray winstone, to emma watson and to the actors who voiced the ugly abominable rock monsters, nick nolte, Frank langella, Mark margollis and Kevin Durand shame on all of you, you have all done your roles poorly I surely hope all of the discs for this abomination get incinerated and burned they should throw away all the dvds and blu rays for this nasty film like I said it must not be shown by anyone, avoid it at all costs"

" Follow the Word given but be sure to have the wisdom to understand it first..
",0.8201,0.999,2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,"This is the point of the movie. God is talking to Noah and telling him exactly what to do in his vision. But is it exactly everything? And this is the beauty of this story told perfectly in the movie Noah from Darren Arronofsky. There are so many levels and I'm not talking about the CGI effects or the Watchers, although the actors did great work (especially Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Anthony Hopkins and others) and Darren as always delivered us yet another amazing experience and atmosphere. The Universal law says that there is the source and the consequence always connected from the times of beginnings and will always be. There is the wisdom of the mind and the love and energy of the heart. And the connecting will power of the two will set anything into motion. All our actions started as a thought and they end up in deeds, any deed, from small ones, to the big ones even like saving or destroying the whole world. So all of this is given to human. Such powerful toll all of us have unlike any other creature on this planet. So it's up to us to decide what to do and deal with the consequences. Because of how human acted then, the great flood came. But God warned Noah was and gave him the most important task. Reset is coming, save the innocent. Is there any place for humans there? Noah did perfectly with his task until he was put to a real test. Does following exactly what God intended for him includes even going against the ones he cares the most? Of many of qualities Noah had in this movie, wisdom and clear vision were one of the most important on the list. But it wasn't easy to find them always. Same goes for everyone. What does God want from us? With the Humans the wisdom will always be the key. And God left it to us to use it. Today is Corona virus stopping everything, tomorrow maybe some other kind of ""flood"" and we need to have good connection to our roots and nature (of our selves) and see things clearly so our actions can come from wisdom. It's not easy. And we don't even have the task Noah got. Still we all have the responsibility. This is why I really love this move. It's so spiritual and important. Go back to your roots, to your nature of what it really means to be human to protect and have connection to everything around you. If God created us on his image means we have to be connected, not disconnected, we have to have His/Human qualities and be the protector of everything that exists on this planet, everything innocent and pass the knowledge further. Otherwise a new flood in whatever form can come.."

",-0.2716,0.992,2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,"This is a daring but flawed film of Aronofsky. Visually it is splendid. CGI is well handled except for the effects on Anthony Hopkins, they look ridiculous. There is a mix of good and bad acting. Some characters are not developed at all, others yes, but I must say I am truly admirative of Noah's character development. It is such an icon that I did not even think the writers would dare to write him a real ark (no pun intended), but they did. It is for me one of the strong aspects of the movie.
Otherwise, a villain with great line, but not developped. Some problems in the narrations. The intro is too rushed and the ""story scene"" that comes later in the scene should have been used at the beginning. A lot of plot holes and things left unexplained. It is not because you make a movie about a godly intervention that it is tolerable to use this excuse as a deus ex machina everytime it helps the plot to go further. The story however is good and I liked the originality with the stone giants. By far not a good movie, but an interesting one without a doubt."
" A good movie - and I hated it
",-0.3182,-0.3572,2020-04-05 00:00:00,6,"It takes skill from a filmmaker and actors to evoke an emotion from the viewer and thus Aronofsky and Crowe have done their respective jobs well in this regard. However, I don't think I have ever hated a protagonist so much as I did with Noah in this movie and I am not sure that those were the emotions I wanted to feel. A religious fanatic, trying to pursue a vision that came to him in a dream supposedly from god, Noah tramples on everything and everyone. A hateful man, pursuing a hateful vision, sent by the cold, distant and hateful god of the Old Testament - I couldn't wait for someone to throw this self-righteous Noah off his ship and into the sea. The mindset represented by Noah is usually that of psychopaths and the murderous religious conviction with which he pursued his vision just reminded me of the worst dictators and tyrants in history. At least Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly were there to make this despicable story watchable. What the movie set out to show, it did well - but if you hate the story and you hate the protagonist, there are only so many points you can award. Six points is plenty generous and most of these points are thanks to Watson and Connelly."

But even I, as a 'neutral' non-religious person who does not adhere to any of the Abrahamic faiths, can see what distorted and falsified nonsense this movie is.The story, the characters, the not-so-subtle left-wing political messages, everything about this film is false, manufactured Hollywood rubbish. As I say, I know next to nothing about Noah or the Bible, but I'm pretty certain the Noah that is presented in this film is nothing like the reality.The only redeeming quality, and the only reason I'm not giving this humongous pile of garbage one star, is the half-decent production and acting performances. Apart from that, 'Noah' is awful."

Hardly anything in the movie other than creating an ark was accurate from what the story of Noah really was. So disappointed."

",-0.6249,-0.9998,2020-03-24 00:00:00,1,"Jesus christ what were they all thinking this movie is terrible garbage, everything about this is bad, it is basically about the bible of how god wiped out the earth, and it starts out with Noah played by Russell Crowe with his family visiting his grandfather played by Anthony Hopkins who plans to plant a seed in the earth. and later the plot gets all pointless and stupid they then meet a young girl ilha played by Emma Watson and they make her part of the family but why would they do that, that is stupid cause you don't just let a non family become a relative unless he or she marries one of the family members but she didn't do that until later when she meets one of the sons, and then the group meets tubal cain played by ray Winstone he then threatens noah and tells him that he and his men will take the ark, it all goes into an unemotional melodrama nothing in this movie is convincing it is beyond bad and then the other members of the family who are Shem (Douglas booth), ham (Logan Lerman) Naahmeh ( Jennifer Connolly , Methuselah (anthony hopkins) and Ilah ( Emma Watson) all of them did a terrible job in portraying their charachters, and again as you see their names are Methusellah, Ham, Shem, Ilha, Naahmeh, and tubal cain, really?? what kind of stupid names are those they are all dumb and all of that stuff is only better in a book, it is unacceptable as a movie, This film also has scenes where things get washed up on land and they climb to get on the garden of eden where adam and eve meet many viewers have mentioned about this in this god awful atrocity, and that is how they criticize the film and now how do you criticize aronofsky's directing well lets count the ways , what he put in this movie was nonsensical ,he was not filling in any blanks to the story he was just butchering it, making as if it was a bad tale and it shouldn't have been made. the movie itself shouldn't have been made and aronofsky actually thought it was a good idea? , well he thought wrong it was a bad idea to write the movie and make it, it was a very bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad idea. and people who see this can actually think it is real and that it will happen in the future, what he has done is endanger all of us, and therefore it makes people nervous and go crazy like in chicken little when he said the sky is falling and we are all going to be taken over. making this was a mistake and all the blame goes to aronofsy and handel shame on both of you you are by making this biggest insult, yes this movie is a gigantic insult to the world , it is a disgrace to the film industry and a complete waste of actor's talent, the stupidest part is where they put ugly rock monsters in the movie, really?? rock monsters, this is stupid, my god , this movie is ugly, and as you see those rock monsters are supposed to be those fallen angels from the book also known as the watchers , but in the book they were not monsters they were angels in the sky and if they are called watchers they are supposed to be staying in the sky and watching us not falling to the ground and turning into rock monsters with octopus arms and sunlight inside them. and guess what they hate everybody else except noah and his family and they help them build the ark this was not in the book, it is all done pointlessly and poorly written it is not interesting ,it is not meaningful, and it is meaningless , dumb , idiotic, appalling , and nonsensical, the editing is bad, and the script is atrociously done, what aronofsky is trying to tell us is that it is ok to be a satan worshiper but it is not, no other movie director would make this colossal abomination and disrespect god, and when you see the shots made and the designs looking bad all you see is just fake pieces of clothing being worn all rotten and old. the costume designs are bad. then comes the scene were the rain starts and the flood begins and before that the remaining men and cain try to get to the ark but those stupid , ugly and abominable rock monsters just smash their faces and wigle their noodeley octupus arms at them from surviving and when they move and wigle their arms around it all looks fake, the special effects were poorly done, and the landscape in the movie didn't look real it just looked like a display of a small artificial land that is shown in a museum. the ark also looked poorly depicted , it just looks like a bunch of large plastic logs put togeather like giant shipping artifacts, then cain survives and joins the family on the ark , and that it actually shows noah's sons having wives and they have no chemistry with them at all and they fail to survive thanks to noah who has done nothing but angered his whole family and like his wife said he will be hated by all the ones he loved, seriously this is the worst storyline and script ever i hate how this movie has bad characters and especially how russell crowe portrayed noah himself he did it all to poorly , all the flooding was all done wrong , and not to mention that emma watson has a baby in this with douglas booth whom she has zero chemistry with, her baby bump looks fake , she doesn't even look like she is pregnant at all she looks like she just put a box under her shirt , then it ends up with noah attempting to kill her newborn daughters but he doesn't , she was very annoying in this mess screaming like crazy, and it fails to be melodramatic , it is not thought provoking and it is meaningless. bad, sad and painfully awful things happen to the characters but you don't even feel sorry for them. and how did aronofsky decide to make this abomination he should be ashamed of himself dont get me wrong he is a very interesting director he makes really good indie films but here he was miscast as director here i dont buy him as a director for making big budget epic movies at all and whats worse is he worked with a horrible screenwriter who is ari handel he cannot write and it is a shame that a very talented indie director who became so distinguished to cinema is working with a horrible writer who cannot write aronofsky should stick to making indie films with weird premises and thought provoking ideas. but if this is what he will do for the rest of his career he will become the next ed wood of this generation. final grade score F"
" Noah (2014, Darren Aronovsky)
",0.0,0.9453,2020-03-24 00:00:00,2,"The film has an excellent cast. It starts promisingly, but is soon let down by a howling maelstrom of themes clshing in confusion much like the tempest and unending rain flooding the earth as they float in a sort of enormous shed on the limitless oceans.The potentially interesting angle of practical matters involved in an ark are skated over, as are all specific and potentially rich avenues of life on an ark.Instead, the focus is on family, childen, and a range of characters who don't take on proper form because the script doesn't let them. There are only three central character, and none of these are developed meaningfully. Including Noah, who is a symbol without persona.It's a film which passed very slowly. And yet the film was not without some critical success, which makes me wonder.Minor point : Crowe is directed with the current malady of actors mumbling and muttering their lines at the very limits of what is audible. Oe gets the impression this is a technique to make us strain to hear, and pay attention, giving the illusion this is something really worth listening to. The bits we can't quite make out, we subconsciously think must be profoundly deep and meaningful since, being inaudible, they are cloaked in mystery."

" Honestly, this is...THE VERY WORST ADAPTION OF A BIBLICAL STORY I'VE EVER SEEN!
",-0.6311,0.9096,2020-02-23 00:00:00,1,"The first time I saw this movie was a long time ago with my family, and we hate it so much. I hated it enough that I left in the middle of it, so many thoughts about it running through my mind. Then, I saw it again for the 2nd time in preparation for making my review on this film, and when I did...my thoughts on why I disliked it became clearer.The story and direction of the film was pretty much a dump every step of the way. It was not only completely unfaithful to the actual story, but the dark, dramatic, and depressing tone it had was so overwhelming it made things FAR from fun. It was too overbalanced from all three of those descriptions. Not only that, but the film seemed to lean too much on environmentalist values, especially because of the emphasis of animal value over humans.For those who think that the action sequences are the most sluggish and uneventful ever seen in a film, I very much agree. Even though the characters were obviously fighting, they lacked energy and liveliness.The CGI that was used in this movie was also something that I found to be cheesy. Much more than ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", if I may add. Every effect that was used in this film had so many obvious signs that they were done by computer, right down to the flood waters.On the subject of the acting, I definitely don't doubt the abilities of its cast. They were okay. However, their talents and abilities were completely wasted by the film's script and direction, like they were as drowned as the wicked people in the flood. It doesn't help that the dialogue they were given for their characters was as forgettable as a forgotten memory, that's for sure.The character development overall didn't even signify much of a great growth for each character, particularly because it wasn't clear on if the commitment of Noah and his family was diminished or not. It was almost even like saying we should throw our faith and trust in the Lord away like garbage.In conclusion, this film is an absolute disaster. Not only due to the waste of talent, but for having too much Hollywood and too little Bible."
" Breathtaking

This movies is an excellent adaptation of the fantasy like story of Noah and even dare I say it, it is one of the most accurate representation of this fantasy like story from the Bible.Do not get me wrong, faith is important but in someways, every religion is just a fantasy based human creation with stories full of fantasy and imagination. It depends on you to choose one religion over an another but keep that in mind that it is just your choice of fantasy.
If we keep this in mind we realise that this is Aronofsky's fantasy of how he imagines the stories from the Bible and I think it is a somewhat beautiful perspective. I loved every scene, the action, the drama, the acting and the list goes on.Christian movies are universally hated because of their low quality and if one of the most talented directors create something like Noah, they become generally hated from christians who like to keep their religion simple minded and almost borderline stupid."
" Incredibly moving, fantastical, retelling of the story of Noah.
",0.507,0.9968,2020-02-22 00:00:00,10,"I was immediatly struck by how this film transports you to an older mythical version of the Earth, and introduces the viewer to the Biblical story.
A primordial, dreamtime of ancient humanity, where Mankind is still close to God, and miracles are real. Here the art direction tends toward fantasy, and this is an artistic decision that uniquely suits this epic story.Noah is portrayed as a faithful shepard, seeking to save the world. He is gentle but strong, and Russell Crowe portrays him perfectly. All of the characters are portrayed with emotion and depth, which invites the audience to care about their story, which is indeed, a universal human story of mankind's fall from grace and search for redemption and harmony with nature. This is a deeply spiritual film, and it's heart and soul is in exactly the right place.The cinematography is bleak and beautiful, and other times radiant and emotive. It's a joy to behold. And the tale is not without action and intrigue either, with plenty of suspense and mystery to keep you engaged.The culmination of Noah moved me to tears of joy and sorrow, at the beauty and tradgedy of humankind. An ultimately life affirming, thought provoking and profoundly moral retelling of this classic Biblical myth.I would recommend it to anyone, whether you are religious or not. It's just an excellent, awesome movie, all round. Enjoy!"

I'm a huge fan of both Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly and they presented believable characters. Russell Crowe was recently in my hometown of Wilmington NC filming and word always gets around regarding the behaviors of the artist that film here on the coast of NC. There were nothing but excellent things being said about Russell Crowe. Some referred to him as a true gentleman. I applaud a cast and crew that took on such a controversial topic.

I mean 5.8 really???? That kind of rating is reserved for films like Scrapy movie have a higher rating!Okay Normally i would have rated the film about 8/10. This is not a perfect film but it is quite excellent.
The positives:
1) Russell Crowe is brilliant.
2) Some of the imagery in the film is truly breath-taking especially one scene about creation.
3) Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as ever, Emma Watson gives one of her best acting performances.
4) For me the best part of the film was Jennifer Conelly. The fact that she was not even nominated for an Oscar is a travesty. It's her best performance since Requiem for a Dream. (yes better than in A Beautiful Mind) she absolutely steals every scene she as a torn apart Mother / Wife.
5) The Ending: The Film pushes it's Lead to make a tough decision, something that a love. There is no escape for him as in so many different Films. The Character has to make a difficult decision and he makes it.Bad:
1) Special Affects is the most obvious one. Especially with the animals, they look very clearly unreal.
2) The Film suffers from pacing from time to time, at first in the very beginning when things take time to roll off. Later the scenes in the Arc are a bit slow.
Overall: Excellent film as expected from it's director. Had there been better special effects without certain pacing issues this film could have been even greater. Honest Rating (8/10)*I am giving it a 10/10 for the gross injustice of the rating here."

" Thank God for Filmmaking Like This!
",0.75,0.9975,2019-10-06 00:00:00,9,"Darren Aronofsky's gonzo biblical epic, Noah, is the type of bizarre, controversial, thought provoking passion project that Hollywood studios have always been terrified of. It's for good reason. Strangeness is an enemy of audience enthusiasm. But where we're used to weird, experimental films of modest scope and ambition, Noah is one writ large. Really large. Here is an epic of extraordinary vision. A work of intelligent insanity that brims with ideas and thrills with images of terrifying power. Noah is as ballsy a blockbuster as you're likely to ever see. A Bible story that throws out the rule book and goes for broke. It's shocking, stunning, awesome, and thank the Lord it actually got made.Noah uses the book of Genesis as a thematic guide and not necessarily for structure. This Noah's ark story is more closely related to action epics like 300 or The Lord of the Rings than it is to The Ten Commandments. Russell Crowe plays Noah, a man burdened by God with the foresight of impending apocalypse and a calling to save creation from the great sinning horde. What is in the Bible a simple parable is expanded by Aronofsky into an involving epic of a conflicted hero. Aronofsky and Ari Handel's script is highly interpretive, inventing strange wonders like the fallen angels encased in rock that help in Noah's mission, and expanding on the humans God saw fit to punish. It's a story with monsters and brutality, mysticism and violence, and it almost feels sacrilegious. But Aronofsky uses the Bible in important ways. He takes the words seriously. Noah, the movie, genuinely considers its character's dilemmas. Is it a sin to punish others in the name of God? If it is God's will to punish humanity, is the act of continuing on a mortal sin? Is humanity worth saving? Those are heavy theological questions, and here is a movie with the courage to ask them. A religious person could look at the surface of Noah, with its magic realism and its black heart, and find it blasphemous. However, watching the film and thinking about it intelligently actually provides a greater context through which to interpret the Bible. It's a faith-based movie that doesn't comfort or coddle, but challenges and strengthens one's faith.The way Aronofsky visualizes his action-packed theological meditation is the demented genius of Noah. The storybook Noah's ark, with its sunny skies and kindly protector are nowhere close. The Darren Aronofsky version of the world of Genesis is alien beauty and pure nightmare. Noah is a truly visionary spectacle. In image after image, I found myself floored by Aronofsky's audacity. Consider some of these sequences: An otherworldly sunset meteor shower, a creation montage that boldly traces the entirety of evolution on Earth, and an apocalyptic vision of the flood more gutturally horrifying than any I've ever seen. Here is powerful visual filmmaking, done with a kind of surging bravado only a director like Aronofsky can pull off. Even in the action scenes, Noah feels like a living dream. There are sounds and images in the film's battles that are as thrilling as any in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and they materialize the thunderous, awesome power of the Old Testament God to stunning effect.Anchoring what begins as a conflicted hero's journey and shifts into an intense family drama is Crowe. Sturdy but internally petrified, Crowe gives a difficult character one of his very best performances. The same can be said for Jennifer Connelly as Naameh, who provides the deepest emotional connection of the film, or Ray Winstone as the face of human depravity and sin. The movie is made up of raw human emotion and the actors bring everything they have to it.Noah is a gift. In a movie landscape that gets safer and smaller every week, a film with its scope and reckless creative freedom is all the more valuable. Let others praise blockbusters that placate the senses and dull the mind. I'll stand up for a movie with the cajones to turn the story of Noah's ark into a thoughtful, smart, bloody, insane action epic unlike anything else.94/100"

It was a if an Atheist took about a quarter of the traditional Christian story, threw in a sprinkle of Scientology, a healthy pinch of Wiccan and a whole lot of WTF.

But something was nagging in the back of my mind during this whole experience. And by the halfway point I found it. This film takes the Biblical narrative and completely rips it apart. Not just story-wise. But from the characters to the narrative that follows the flood. Say what you want about the Exodus film, at least it stays partially true to the story, given its many deviances. Noah does it's own thing and likes to play around with the story. From a secular perspective it's nothing to fuss about. But from someone who believes in the story and the morals it teaches, I take great issue with a film that turns Noah into a villain halfway through, makes up stories about angelic rock monsters and somehow forgets that Ham becomes the future of the African races without a wife to reproduce??"

And I was not disappointed.The movie tells the well-known story of the bible in which Noah is given a task by God to take all pairs of animals to safety when a river that will doom man approaches.Granted, not being a believing Christian, I am not too familiar with the details of the story, but from what I know, the movie told it rather well, and in an exciting fashion, none the less. The world in this movie feels very mysterious and alive, supernatural events are mixed well with known history and makes it believable that this actually might have happened in some capacity.Russel Crowe delivers one of the best performances of his career in this one, and you really learn to empathise with Noah, even in his darker moments, and the ending of the movie is both beautiful and heart-breaking. The rest of the enesemble is really strong as well, with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson. All of which play great characters.The visuals of this movie are simply marvelous, as stated above, this world truly comes alive thanks to the strong cinematography. The CGI for the Stone Giants is fantastic and you can't help but wonder if they are actually there when seeing them.Overall, this is a fantastic movie with fantastic performances and a great scope. Aronofsky delivers again in perhaps one of his best movies, and it's a shame lots of people doesn't like this.I can't give it less then a 10 out of 10, this is truly a masterpiece!"
" Real bad
",-0.5423,0.9305,2019-08-18 00:00:00,4,"I watched this movie because the trailer looked great, at least for me anyway. It's a retelling of Noah, who made the ark before the Great Flood.I didn't actually mind if they made a bit of changes from the Biblical account, but they did a lot. And the worst part are the talking stone giants. When I saw them, I knew the movie is going downhill.This movie has like $150 million budget, I've read, but most of the visual effects looked cheap and poorly done. Cinematography also isn't that good. I was shocked to see that it's a hundred million dollar film.Emma Watson, I feel, is miscast. Connelly is an okay choice, but someone could've played Noah's wife better. Their two sons, Percy Jackson and the hot British actor, were not great choices for the roles. Only Russell Crowe seems to be the only right actor fit for the role."
" Bad

" Very Good: 8.5
",0.4927,0.9766,2019-07-29 00:00:00,8,"It seems like movies based on events described in either the Old or New Testaments are a mixed bag. On one hand, they're stories that everyone has at least some idea about, so the built-in audience is fairly high. But on the other, more often than not, they tend to treat their subject matter as a way to preach to the audience. Thankfully, Noah does not preach, but chooses merely to tell the story, which is ironically the film's biggest flaw. We all know how this tale begins and ends, as well as a good deal of what's in between. So even though the events that aren't depicted in the source material serve to make the world seem that much more real, they also feel relatively inconsequential in comparison to the whole. And as a result of all this, the runtime feels slightly excessive. But the visuals are stunning and the performances are strong, and in some ways, that's enough."

" Noah is flooded with artistic interpretation creating an inconsistent fantasy.
",0.296,0.8611,2019-04-21 00:00:00,6,"Aronofsky is a visual auteur. One for infamously producing evocative imagery to convey the very essence of humanity. For him to helm the retelling of possibly one of the most well-known biblical narratives, well, it was always going to be divisive. He does not settle for simplicity, and with that he turned a stormy apocalyptic tale into a brooding family drama that frequently swims in shallow storytelling waters rather than deep ambiguous oceans. Noah is gifted with visions depicting the destruction of the world by the hand's of God. He is tasked with building an ark that will house Earth's wildlife once the planet has been reset from humanity's sinful destruction.More often than not, people will give close-minded remarks such as ""Noah's Ark but with stupid rock monsters"". Whilst these golems do not necessarily make for a realistic interpretation, they do however shroud this story in a fantastical aura of prophecy and mysticism. Aronofsky takes the visualisation of Noah's tale and injects his own flair into it, by adding traits found in fantasy stories. Does it deter from the central story? Absolutely not. In fact I would be more inclined to state that it develops its themes even further. A barren wasteland covers the world due to humanity's neglect of God's creations (even if Aronofsky embeds scientific subtext within the religious readings). Deforestation, endlessly hunting wildlife to its extinction and the lust for omnipotence. The depiction of our own savagery is retained throughout, and makes for intriguing perspectives on creationism and the need for survival.Having said that, Aronofsky unfortunately succumbs to heavy-handed storytelling that unknowingly spoon feeds its themes to the audience. Whether it be Noah and his family reflecting on the sins of humanity, or Aronofsky cutting to an artistic stylised montage (containing hundreds of still framed shots) depicting destruction. It leaves no room for imagination, which ultimately is a step back for a director who often relishes in ambiguity. I also take issue with the narrative structure, most notably the third act. The first two acts satisfyingly retell the story of Noah's Ark, emitting visual splendour in every scene. Once the storm hits and the focus is on the characters of Noah and his family, the tone seemingly shifts to a psychological drama. The blurred line between visionary miracles and paranoid delusions is strangely explored through Aronofsky's trademark third act mental instability, and it doesn't work for this story. It's a jarring tonal shift that detracts from the biblical teachings that the story exhumes.Fortunately the performances from the main cast, especially Connelly and Crowe, were engaging enough to retain the pace during the third act. As someone who does not particularly find Winstone or Watson interesting, they both gave suitable performances even if the latter pretty much screamed her lines. The visual effects were delightful, the score was epic and the cinematography was frequently jaw-dropping.One could say that this was an unusual project for Aronofsky to helm, but upon reflection it strangely suited him. Despite the harsh narrative execution and misdirected third act, it's a refreshing interpretation of a classic tale that showcases Aronofsky's luminary artistic style. Whether you are an individual of faith or not, we can all agree that Noah is better than 'Evan Almighty'..."

",0.4404,0.7865,2019-04-02 00:00:00,7,"I liked Noah, because it is a fantasy film with an ecologic message, where the danger of interpreting what ""God"" means is a life and death game, instead of a simple religious absolute.But what I appreciated more, is the creation of a pre-draught, fantasy world, with weird animals and minerals, and a sky so pure one can see the stars in daytime - which probably accounts for these humans' longer lives.Most of all, the photography was superb, rich in contrasts, and Crowes' acting was that of a progressive change. Emma Watson was also particularly touching, as was Jennifer Connally.So, 7/10 for the vision, for the message and for nice performences. Sure, there are some jarring parts (like the Watcher's peculiar looks and animation) and some dark scenes, but all in all that was something quite different."

Over acted mostly, badly acted at others this looong fantasy drama sees Crowe adopt his best English accent for the (presumably) Middle Eastern character and his rather irritating immediate family, to escape the epic flood......with the assistance of some rock creatures straight out of the 60's Dr. Who special effects department.
Yes it really is that ludicrous. Tedious dialogue and endless meaningful stares are supposed to remind us of the epic nature of the struggle
but just serve to want the viewer yearn to see the ark (which has all the hydro dynamic properties of a house brick) dash against the nearest rock.Crowe looks like he struggles to get up the ladder, having obviously fed himself up for the journey....whilst the rest of the 'crew' could obviously do with tucking into some of the stock.
The cast do well only insofar as they manage not to look as embarrassed as they clearly should be....both at the dialogue and their own excruciating performances.
Emily Watson is as unconvincing as ever, dropping tears as swiftly as you could drop a hat.
Blah blah - on it goes. A colossal raft packed full of creatures that make hardly any sound and don't create any droppings or waste and never seem to need feeding. Perhaps Crowe ate them all.

" A somewhat plausible plot with stunning visuals.
",0.3818,0.9854,2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"If there's any filmmaker more controversial than Darren Aronofsky, I'm not sure who it would be at this point. Interestingly enough, while most of his films are rated ""R"" (or higher, like the uncut Requiem for a Dream (2000)), I think Noah (2014) is the first time one of his films has been at the PG-13 rating. Since most of the controversy of his movies comes via the content that would make it R-rated, it's interesting that the controversy with Noah is more along the lines of how Aronofsky filled in the gaps and created a dramatic narrative inside the Biblical story of Noah.As is always the case with an Aronofsky film, Noah is a beautiful spectacle of filmmaking. Even if the landscapes of Iceland helped create this stunning setting, certain dream-like sequences and moments speak to the art that Aronofsky can evoke on the screen. The setting of the pre-flood world is believable, and most of the costumes and characters make sense, with the exception being the CGI-fueled ""fallen angels."" Because the film is distinctly in the visual style of Aronofsky, there were a few ""artistic liberties"" taken with the story to create this contrast of good vs. evil.I do find it interesting how a short story that comprises a small section of Genesis in the Bible was able to be filled out to a movie that's over 2-hours long. What helps piece together this narrative is the context of the Biblical story before this event. Drawing conclusions from what we know about the lineage as well as a number of Biblical specifics, the plot seems mostly plausible. That being said, there are a few facets to the story that contrasts with what the Bible says. Still, if it gets people to pick up a Bible and start reading, all the better.A somewhat plausible plot with stunning visuals, I give Noah 4.0 stars out of 5."

Those rocky things called the fallen are good spirits-angels that wanted to help humanity but God cursed them??? WHAT!?!?!!! Are you serious? What does this say about God??? Do you see where I'm going with this? God is depicted as lunatic!Dear director, if you hated the story so much why did you take it in the first place and ruined the truth of the bible just to make what it really is not?However, there is one thing I learned from this experience. Don't get your hopes up, anything Biblical will be used to depict God as egotistical maniac and His servants as schizophrenic idiots, just for the sake of defending humanistic and socially acceptable view of God.This is exactly what this movie accomplished."

It's unclear from the original text as to when he created giant rock monsters but fast forward to 2014 and Darren Aronofski released the film, Noah. While God took 7 days to create the World, Aronofski's reboot of God's epic took 14 years (screenplay to release) and cost $130 million. We can only speculate over God's budget for the original but given his work was antediluvian, we can assume it must have been on a relative shoestring.Perhaps a direct comparison is not fair. While Darrenofski is one of the few modern Directors to be consistently given a sizeable budget to fulfil a singular vision, God had complete autonomy (and omnipotence).So comparisons aside, does Darrenofski's flick sink or float? For all the epic scale, special effects and aforementioned giant rock monsters of the first act, Noah is most engaging when it develops into a story of a family rent asunder by a father's will to do what he believes is right.It is this second act, set wholly within the ark in which all supporting actors shine in their portrayals of various family members torn between ultimate sacrifice and the protection of innocence. Crowe's performance is adept as the conflicted-come murderous father and far more rewarding for me than the well-trodden fight scenes of Act 1.But as engaging as the second act is, it will remain for me the only memorable element of a film which is hindered more than helped by its epic scale. Perhaps both auteurs could have benefitted from reigning in their vision slightly, after all God did create Michael Bay."

",0.0772,0.9794,2019-01-24 00:00:00,9,"The Bible tells the story of Noah in Genesis 6-9, which is only 4 chapters long. The movie Noah is over 2 hours long, so that should immediately show that there will be inaccuracies.Think about Jonah: A Veggie Tales Movie-that is also adapted from a 4 chapter story and that has a bonus plot involving a seafood restaurant. The actual story has fish slappers, Go Fish playing, a cheese curls sweepstakes, etc.Of course, many people love Veggie Tales despite this. When it comes to live action movies that twist on the Bible, that's when things get controversial.Think back to 1988, when The Last Temptation of Christ, a movie Martin Scorsese made as a personal journey to consider what the human nature of Jesus was like, released.Since that strayed from the Gospels, and had scenes like Jesus making love to Mary Magdalene, there were protests, vandalized theaters, attacked moviegoers(if they wanted to see it), bans in multiple countries, and even death threats to Scorsese.How ironic it is that the movie portrays God's love better than the Christians against the movie, many of whom did not even bother to see it! I did, and it is a tie for my favorite movie!Now, what does this have to do with Noah? Noah has gained controversy as well, but not as harshly. This also strays from the Bible in many ways.Some examples of this are: Rock monsters helping to build the ark, Methuselah-the oldest man in the Bible, being related to Noah and not having a fruit in ages, as well as dying in the flood, Noah preaching doom and not repentance for his wicked neighbors, Noah's daughter in law giving birth on the ark,etc.These changes are weird and take a few minutes to adjust to(hence my 9/10) but after a while I just put the fact that this is supposed to be a Bible story in the back of my mind and enjoyed it as what it is-a movie. That is a huge improvement from my 6/10 I gave it the first time I watched this movie.To get to my point, if you want Genesis onscreen, then skip this movie. If you are curious and open to a re-interpretation of this story, then this movie is worth your time. If you are in the first category, then do not read any more reviews and move on to another movie to learn about."

" A blasphemous, grotesquely moronic, paganistic interpretation of Noah and the flood.
",-0.5719,-0.9623,2019-01-09 00:00:00,3,"I'm a staunch believer of the Bible, other scriptures, and also Biblical 'timelines.' I believe that nearly everything that transpired in the Bible -- transpired in the manner that the Bible purported it to -- and in the time-frames that it purported it to. I don't believe that the Bible is simply a book of 'fables' or 'morality tales' -which false and idiotic notions are becoming more and more popular among all people these days.
In today's day and age, many or most people would consider me 'gullible,' 'foolish,' or 'illogical' as a staunch believer in scriptures. However, I believe that it's 'the other way around': Society and people have never been more blasphemous or stupid than they are in today's day and age -- and it absolutely is NOT 'concidental' that the waning intelligence in society has 'coincided' with 'secularism' and people becoming 'atheist' and returning to pagan roots and losing their faith and knowledge in things that are 'spiritual' and in God: This is one of many proofs that 'the glory of God truly IS intelligence'.....and that conversely, society and people do become stupid in EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY when they become 'God-less.'Nearly everything; nearly every aspect of society for the past at least 50-60 years, has become exponentially stupider and stupider with every succeeding decade.....and there's no reason to believe this trend will not continue.....
Movies have never been more talentless and stupider; neither have today's 'sports heroes'/'athletes' today's music........today's politicians, most everything...
Critics have longed lost the ability to 'critique': A very high percentage of movies that are truly dreadful and awful 1 or 0-star movies -- which not surprisingly have appeared mostly only starting in the 2000s to the present date, are considered to be 'great' 4-star movies by many or most critics. One of many examples of this is that I have very unbiasedly given ""0 star"" ratings to two of the newest Star Trek movies (Chris Pine and company). Yes, I believe that they are THAT stupid and talentless....and THAT bad.
I believe that the Biblical Noah was a very righteous and holy man....and that he was commanded to build an ark by the Lord. I believe that the Lord did guide ""2 of every species"" of all animal life into the ark; and that this thing DID actually happen and WAS possible. I believe that for all intents and purposes, that the sheer number of animal species 5,000 years ago may not need have been in the many thousands or millions...but perhaps only several thousands, or even hundreds. I believe that it IS 'logical' to believe that the 'process' of 'speciation' of all 'carbon-based life forms' has occured MUCH MORE RAPIDLY than what most scientists would ever deduce: Once the hundreds or several thousand species of animals departed Noah's ark AFTER the flood...it would have taken only a short amount of time, only several thousand years (to the present date) for thousands or millions of 'new species' of animals to have formed -by means of adaptation and mutations- from originally only hundreds or a few thousand species. Hence, the ""Biblical"" size of Noah's ark (500 feet long?) could have easily accomodated all the species of animals present at THAT TIME on earth.I also believe that Noah's flood DID cover the ENTIRE earth.....and that the highest mountains on earth at THAT time may have only been several thousands of feet high. It wasn't until AFTER the flood, in my opinion, that ""Pangae"" separated into the continents that exist today.....and that mountains became ALL OF A SUDDEN IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME exceedingly high -due to an EXTRAODINARILY-RAPID movement of all plate tectonics throughout the planet, which were caused by the flood to accelerate.....before they 'slowed down' to the very slow rate that they move today...Noah's flood, also, was likely abetted by aquifers in the earth; in other words perhaps rain, alone, for 40 days could not have covered the earth...One of the first movies that I saw Russell Crowe star in was in ""Master and Commander: Far Side of the Earth."" Because of my impressions of him in that movie -- as well as in 'Gladiator' -- I felt that at that time that he was a legitimate actor, if even a very good actor. However, since about that time (early 2000s), about every movie that I have seen him ever since, his acting skills have diminished exceedingly..and I can't recall a movie that I have seen him in since the early 2000s, in which his performance was NOT atrocious. He almost always speeks with a moronic 'gruff,' hoarse voice that is very difficult for me to understand -- hence, I'm sure is impossible for someone that is in the process of 'learning English' to understand -- he conveys very little emotion and his overall acting abilities are pathetic. He does truly belong in today's modern age of actors ; a very very stupid modern age that produces such 'actors' as Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, Brad Pitt, Chris Pine and a slew of other 'incredibly-bad' actors that don't have 1/3 the acting abilities of past greats such as Cary Grant, James Stewart, Spencer Tracy, or even Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise.Though Crowe purports to be ""Christian,"" his selection of playing roles in a movie such as THIS (Noah) and many other recent movies seems to suggest that he is a very 'laxed,' 'lapsed,' or 'dumbass' Christian.The movie, 'Noah,' starts out with Noah and his family in a barren wasteland. The descendants of Cain have filled the earth and their seeming only purpose is to hunt and kill people. 'In this movie there are ridiculously-unrealistic 'rock monsters' which were formed by the 'creator.' As far as I could recall, the word 'God' is never mentioned in the movie, ""Noah""; apparently it is much 'safer' to create a 'religious' movie these days be making it as 'irreligious' and politically-correct as possible; maybe a movie such as ""Noah"" would have created a lot of controversy or not have been nearly as popular with audiences had the word 'God' been used in the dialog of the movie, rather than 'creator.'The vestiture and attire of Noah, his sons, and the descendants of Cain does not in any way reminisce of what people 5,000 years ago would have dressed like. Most of the clothing is an ugly un-imaginitive black and reminisces of 'barbarism' or 'heathenism' from perhaps a few hundred years ago. The short hair of Noah and his sons reminisces of the 'worldliness' of today's haircut styles.
In the movie, 'Noah,' the story of Noah, his family, and the flood are completely and moronically re-interpreted in a very, very stupid, 'paganistic' and blasphemous way throughout the entire movie. Anthony Hopkins portrays ""Methuselah"" -who I am sure in 'reality' was a very holy and wise man. However, in the movie, ""Noah,"" Methuselah is a washed up 'fool' who seems to have no wisdom or knowledge of 'spirituality' or of 'God'....and who is only concerned in his old age with sipping tea and finding berries to eat. In fact, right before the flood washes away Methuselah, he is comedically actually in the process of putting one berry into his mouth immediately before his demise.Giant 'rock monsters' engage the descendants of Cain in a horrific battle as the rain begins to fall heavily which immediately precipitates the deluge. The battle scene is extraordinarily-stupid, unrealistic, and in every way conceivable doesn't even approach to being a 'poor-man's ""Lord of the Rings: Two Towers"" final battle between the orc hoards and the elves...In 'reality' all wicked people perished except for Noah and his wife and his sons and their wives. However, in the movie, 'Noah,' Noah forbids any of his sons from marrying......and not only that but 'Tubal-Cain' portrayed by Ray Winstone ends up 'sneaking' on board.....and killing and eating some of the animals in the ark. Incredibly-incredibly-incredibly blasphemous, grotesque, evil, demented and stupid. Scenarios such as this; a film such as this; could never have entered the mind of anyone alive back in the 1950s or so when the movie titled ""The Bible"" came out -which interpretation of Noah's flood is far superior and far more realistic and accurate than THIS mess of a movie was...The last -- if not ONLY time -- that I can remember watching a movie that was as strangely-fascinating as ""Noah"" -- in part because it IS so stupid and blasphemous -- was when I recently watched, for the first time ever, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988?) starring Willem Dafoe. THAT movie is so 'strange'.....bizarre.......and unintentionally 'dumb'......that I have actually watched it several times SINCE then; it is entertaining and something of a deluded unintentional comedy.
""Noah"" does have some things going for it: It is very strange, original, and unique in certain ways and at times the FX are pretty good...but in just as many ways the 'feeling' throughout the movie isn't one of 'wonder' or imagination....but instead there is a permeating spirit and atmosphere of 'washed up'....and 'pessimism'.......and darkness. ""Noah"" is a convoluted uber-moronic pagan's interpretation of the real-life Noah and flood; in some ways entertaining but also very very stupid -- and to reiterate, blasphemous. I unbiasedly give ""Noah"" a three-star rating."

If the story is accurate, its even more bonkers than the sanitised version we are taught at school is, which makes the narrative hard to like - Noah is not portrayed as a nice chap here. But it is well acted throughout, with only some scene chewing by Ray Winstone, mainly."

Read your book more before you want to give an image upon someone in your movie. It's a big shame! He doesnt let all people died. The people who are believing in the Creator follows Noah into the ark and it wasnt Noah who abandoned the innocents. Only the disbelievers who disobeyed and not into the ark. Duhhh

" ""He's going to destroy the world.""
",-0.5423,0.9788,2018-12-08 00:00:00,7,"At least I thought the film struck a reverent tone when dealing with Noah's (Russell Crowe) beliefs, his faith, and commitment to God. But it's the film makers' imagination that takes the picture in directions that felt contrived and unimaginable. Some I liked and some I didn't. The 'Garden of Eden' seed was a capable metaphor for describing how Noah might possibly have gathered the material necessary to build the immense ark required for the salvation of the planet's animals. But the concept of The Watchers simply eluded me on every level. If I might make an apt comparison, they were like the Jar-Jar Binks of this movie, even though I personally didn't have a whole lot of problems with Jar-Jar in the 'Star Wars' franchise. The rock men called The Watchers may have been fallen angels, but they were a very large distraction for me and looked like they belonged in a kid's sci-fi movie. The acting I thought was good by the main principals, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly in particular. Emma Watson was surprisingly effective as well, as I'm a sucker for actors or actresses who can cry at the drop of a hat. Douglas Booth as Shem and Logan Lerman as Ham were by contrast basically adequate, they didn't move me in any direction one way or the other. In general I don't find much fault with movie CGI but even I was able to pick up on the stodgy quality of the CGI animals in all their iterations. The pairing of the animals is probably the best remembered facet of The Ark story in the Bible, but it gained considerably short shrift in this version, taking a back seat to the family dynamic of Noah's family and the future of mankind. One thing I'll have to admit is that I never thought about the repercussions of humanity being wiped out, only to depend on the survivors of Noah's immediate family. Given the surviving members and the way the picture ends, there's little comfort in imagining how the world repopulated itself."
" the story of Noah's arc
",0.0,0.7978,2018-11-20 00:00:00,2,Review: I found this to be an interesting concept due to taking the classic bible story of Noah's ark and bringing it to life. The direction is good and so is the screenplay. The casting and acting aren't bad. I find this to be a rather interesting choice of movie to adept from the bible because there are so many different choices of stories to be made from the bible some done better then others but no one that I can think of took on the classic story of Noah's ark so I owe a lot of credit to Darren Aronofsky for taking on this massive feet. All in all I would give this 2 stars out of a possible five stars.
" Terrible Interpretation
",-0.4767,0.3976,2018-10-31 00:00:00,1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It strays so far from the accepted canon of the Bible and everything believed about Noah and The Flood. The writers and directors took so many liberties with the story as we know it well.

" Utter Celluloid Trash
",0.0,-0.99,2018-10-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie was a cruel joke perpetuated upon an unsuspecting public who were hoping to see a biblical epic translated to film. Instead what we got was an abomination of a disgusting vile piece of celluloid filth that was neither accurate to the biblical account but deviated so far off track that it was actually offensiveFallen Angels are now transformer rock creatures! Seriously??, Noah was portrayed as a violent psychopath who tried to murder his grandchildren, and Obiwan Methusalah gave him a magic bean that transforms the utter barren waste land where they loved into a lush green forest within minutes......nope I'm not kidding
The special effects were utter garbage, something that came out of a Disney movie 30 years ago, I mean the animals were so fake it was laughable
Also the dialogue could hardly be heard as it was so quiet
Overall an utter garbage of a movie that was a waste of money and time.....the only reason I gave it a 1 as there is no option to give it zero stars.
I think the director's and producers of this movie should feel utterly ashamed of themselves, they had an opportunity to give us a massive big budget biblical epic, but instead they completely botched it and made a mockery of the bible's account
Avoid this movie at all costs"
" Worldview Parallel
",0.0,0.9807,2018-10-14 00:00:00,10,"When it comes to cinematographic features that attempt to endeavor the daunting task of encountering subject-matter and topics which by nature are at the heart of some of our most cherished beliefs and mythologies, it is difficult to please all scopes of worldview which should happen to by definition even deserve the credence of opinion, if not for their shared relation and the relativity of themselves being the audience which it serves. Being neither author nor critic, but a reasoned mind with a complex understanding of early earth mythology and Christian worldview specifically, even as it relates to creation, I can say with great clarity of confidence that this movie was as dramatically inclined as was most fitting for how very well may could have told one such of the many great stories that is the history of mankind. 
Very realistic. The characters ""The watchers"" very scripturally based and precedented. 
Scientific, practical prehistorical theistic mythology."

It rained for ages. Oh and sorry, before that I forgot to mention, he met up with this bloke, Noah. And he told him to built a big boat with a door and get all the animals on it. I don't know where he was knocking about that he was able to get a tiger and a badger....must've lived next to a zoo or summat. Anyway, God gave him two weeks notice and he got them all on somehow. It was rough but they got through it and eventually the water floated off and it was all fine. In fact he did his job too well because he saved too much. You can't move out there for stuff!

" NOT YOUR MOMMA'S NOAH
",0.0,0.6066,2018-10-04 00:00:00,6,"Forget what you think you know about Noah. In this Middle Earth saga the watchers are huge rock creatures that look like they belong in Star Wars. This is a rather bizarre interpretation of Genesis 6:1-5, and was my second WTF moment after that dog with scales thing. In the bible, the Watchers had relations with humans and created a race of giants who apparently ruled over man...not in this film.Russell Crowe portrays Noah as a dark, bitter, dysfunctional, unlikeable person who obeys God through his dreams. (God doesn't even make a cameo.) The women, whose names aren't mentioned in the Bible are given expanded and important roles. All the time on the ark is spent on personal drama. No tending of the animals that are all living together in the hull of the ship.Another problem is that Tubal-Cain kills Noah's father Lamech, not to be confused with Tubal-Cain's father Lamech while Noah was a child.The Bible claims Lamech was born in the 182nd year of Methuselah and lived 777 years. This means he died 10 years before the flood. Noah was over 600 years old at the time of the flood. Do the math.There were a number of surprises, some I won't mention as I wouldn't want to ""spoil"" a millennia tale. That said, at the end, a son leaves the group before them all having children when clearly the families stayed together for a number of years and raised children until the Canaan/Noah incident which is not mentioned.Poor Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly acted their hearts out, reminding me of Sean Astin who gave a wonderful performance in ""Cabin Fever 3."" Nothing like casting pearls before swine.From a biblical prospective, the film was a disaster and not inspirational. As an action adventure story, the rock creatures made me feel like I was watching Indian Jones with aliens. And I suppose people who liked the ending of that film might be attracted to this one.Oh yea, this thing was way too long. It had scenes which dragged on. It needed an editor.This is Razzy material. A film you can watch and make fun of MST style. On the plus side Russell Crowe didn't sing that much.6 star cheese rating. Not too bad for a midnight flick wink wink nudge nudge."

" Abusing Creativity!
",-0.1759,0.9466,2018-09-12 00:00:00,1,"It took me almost one hour thinking is it 10 or 1 !!
And yes it can't be in between. In brief, and if we ignored the religious part which sounds like provoking a lot of people here, history should be told as it is.
Noah, isn't just a religious story, it's history, this kind of movies in 20 years will be a way for kids to know about history, and excuse me I don't want my kids to be misleaded by wrong tales of history.
Imagine this, someone makes a movie about Jesus .. who's in doubt of what really god wants!! 
God picked up Noah, Jesus, Moses and Mohamed ..etc. with confident of their intuition and knowing that they won't be lost -at least with basics- 
Imagine this, someone made a movie about Hitler's intentions ... that he wanted Peace!
I know that the movie didn't variate that much about Noah's intentions .. but there was wide drifting from the real story .. abusive and harmful drift.
But let's suppose that there's no Noah, and it's not a history and not a religious story, the movie will deserve a 10 .. and may be couple of oscars.
It's great to be creative enchanting actually, but I believe there's a limit when it comes to certain things .... at least when it comes to making a movie about a real story.
Ps. I am not a religious person, and this is my 1st, probably my last review ..

But that is not the reason I watched the film - it was because the film was directed by Darren Aronofsky and very well casted. Aronofsky is kind of director that even if his films are shallow they are at least visually striking (The Fountain). I can't say 'Noah' was particularly deep nor shallow as it dealt with classical themes on humans inner fights, hypocrisy and what is wrong what is right. Also I can't say it was visually striking as much - all the epicness were CGI (not that would be bad itself) and it seemed cheap and rushed at places. The epic battle scene in the middle of the film felt wrongly paced and ended as abruptly as it started, and it took 'Noah' little out of balance as after that the film started to fell like it's dragging it's feet.Russell Crowe in his brutal manliness proved again he is meant to carry these sort of epic history/fantasy films."

" A win for Aronofsky fans (and I am one of them).
",0.5859,-0.9738,2018-05-18 00:00:00,8,"I also do not 'get' what all the hysteria is from the religious community regarding this film. Taken by itself, the movie is actually really really good!!! But first, a plot overview for those taken aback by the biblical inconsistencies:
* The Nephilim, represented by walking Treants (living trees with branches -as-arms, human faces, etc), when fighting to protect the arc, upon death get sent to Heaven, and this rallies the rest to fight even harder; in the Bible, the Nephilim are beyond redemption permanently and cannot gain salvation. 
* God is not concerned with, in the opening scene, Noah's one son breaks the stem of a wildflower, and Noah corrects him saying not to destroy the nature that God created; in the Bible, God would not have cared if anyone had done this!!
* Tubal-cain, played brilliantly by Ray Winstone, is the bad guy, trying to sneak onto the Arc (and eventually gets there, by befriending Ham, the 'bad' son of Noah, who gets fooled by Tubal-Cain). This character would mostly be historically accurate, if not for the fact that his only 'sin' portrayed is being overly-zealous and rallying an army with steel weapons to produce siege weaponry. Again, God could care less if trees were cut down to make any sort of technology to be used - God said to A. & E. in the garden, ""This garden is yours to do with as you see fit. The birds of the air, the ground, all is yours to live off of as you see fit (paraphrasing).
* Noah was never tested by God to sacrifice one of his new-born sons!! Abraham, however, was, in similar fashion; but in the movie, God really meant for Noah to kill his newborn - in the Bible, the command to Abraham was only a test of loyalty and the child was stopped from being sacrificed!!
 The beginning of the film starts off with, as I said, one son (I forget which) breaking off a wildflower stem. Then Noah and his family move along, over a very nicely done backdrop of a destroyed wasteland with few resources. They encounter some trouble from strangers and fight. Character of Shem is introduced who has a fiance, Emma 'The Amazing' Watson, and shows a few scenes involving those two. There is a grandfather, Methuselah, who uses his God-granted power of Healing Touch (this is an accurate portrayal of a power true Christians have), causes her to overcome her infertility and directs her to seduce Shem at this time to conceive. I am particularly struck by, how for a movie so Biblically inaccurate, there are some moments that get the culture of the day right, and the previously mentioned scene is particularly tear-jerking and powerful!!! Next, these Nephilim agree to help Noah build the arc (inaccurate), and fight off Tubal-Cain's armies of, I call them the 'unwashed masses' of angry men (inaccurate). Around this time, there is a scramble to get Shem and his fiance, late to arrive, onto the arc. Next, a number of Nephilim begin to die. At around this time, Tubal-Cain manages to enter the arc through a hidden spot around the back, and narrowly avoids the flood. 
Anyways, the film ends with Noah disobeying God by not having the gall to kill his own son. (inaccurate - God was against child sacrifice). 
My only critique of this film is that the character of Tubal-cain is introduced as kind of a one-dimensional character, a typical - we would call today- kind of a thuggish street tough. His leadership abilities are shown, as he rallies his men with am empassioned speech, but really not much jealously from him or personal struggles shown. It never shows anything Tubal-Cain actually did wrong; I was expecting them to show some massively wicked guy. Noah and his family are however greatly complex. I don't know if this is a flaw or if it was intentional - just something I noted. Jennifer Connelly plays Noah's wife, and a great deal of Noah's consciousness are focused on her as she goes over the struggles they are facing with the family aboard the arc. Perhaps a 9 is in order. Perhaps not. Still one of the more memorable films I've seen.
On a side note: I am also a fan of Aronofsky's The Wrestler. I have yet to review it, but it was funny to see Todd Barry playing the wrestler's boss as he works at a supermarket, a side job to his wrestling career. He constantly jabs him in a way only Todd Barry could pull off, it is hilarious!!"

This wreaks of a left coast production. Russel Crowe is not a very good actor either. I swear he's type cast in his role from ""Gladiator"". He's always somber, sullen and inanimate as if he's due to go out into the arena. The mike pickup is bad too because it's hard to understand what he's saying at times because he has a tendency to swallow his words. Too many back shots of him too. What's up with that. I can see why this wasn't well received in the Muslim world due to its deviation from scripture both their Qu'ran and so too the Christian Bible. The director would have done better if he'd created Noah along Cecil B. Demille's ""Ten Commandments"", then it would have had more gravitas at the box office and better received. I'm glad I watched this on FX rather than having paid to view such in a theater."

" A Biblical story that doesn't follow the Bible
",0.0,0.9012,2018-03-25 00:00:00,4,"That's okay, in principle, as the Old Testament itself is full of holes, especially in the earlier times (starting with how do Adam and Eve and 3 sons begat the succeeding generations?), but not if it leaves equally baffling questions, such as who mothered the line of Ham?
Visually, the film is good and some of the acting - notably Jennifer Connolly and Emma Watson, plus a nod to the equally reliable Anthony Hopkins - is excellent. But the whole thing hangs on Noah, who in this case comes across as the sort of fanatical Bible beater we are familiar with (and should be repulsed by) in far too many churches (and not just pseudo-Christian ones) across the world.
Given the nature of the Biblical story, this may have been an impossible task for Russell Crowe (who has shown sensitivity in other roles). And given the impossibility of reconciling the OT God with the Christian one Jesus talked about, perhaps it is time to remove the OT from the Christian Bible and treat it simply as a fascinating origin of man myth and history of the ME peoples, instead of a sacred book. After all, the OT can be - and all too often is - used to justify virtually anything, from incest through slavery to ethnic cleansing!"
" THE BOOK WAS WAY BETTER!!!
",0.5826,0.9854,2018-03-05 00:00:00,1,"I know, I know, I sound like everyone else on this site that always thinks the book is way better, but hey, it WAS written by God(!) whereas the screenplay was just written by some mere mortal, so there's that. 
 Watching Noah, I felt a flood of emotions wash over me, like a tide pulling me this way and that in a great tempest. I really wanted to love this film, but I almost ran screaming like someone abandoning a sinking ship. Not to rain on the parade of those who loved it, but this story simply had no believable arc to it. It seemed like a vast ocean separated me from the folks whom poured a torrent of praise upon Noah. Feeling like I could be missing something, I was compelled to return to the theater for 40 days and 40 nights, but ultimately realized it was a total wash. I'll never get that 100 hours of my life back!"
" Epically crazy
",-0.34,0.8013,2018-03-02 00:00:00,6,Very good production with some evolutionary moments. But so epic. And definitely insane. Full of special effects and some magical powers. And a surprising fire starter. Totally over the top.
" Deeply disappointed in Aronofsky
",-0.5256,0.9891,2018-02-16 00:00:00,1,"Hollywood has a bad history of Biblical epics, replacing subtlety, religious introspection and depth with spectacle, special effects, action sequences and superficial 'romance'. On the other hand, this is Aronofsky (and I am a fan of all his movies) so I was hoping for something more.Right from the start it felt wrong: An attempt to convert the complex story of Noah into a biblical Lord of the Rings. I then thought that instead of expecting it to be the story of Noah, that I could try to just enjoy it as a pure fantasy flick and as a story unrelated to the Bible. But this proved impossible to do, given what I know and how much they used from the original story combined with so many endless annoying distortions and missed opportunities. And even taken as its own story, it suffers from inconsistencies and poor writing.Indeed, many of my criticisms come from comparing this to the Bible story. But even if you don't believe in it, this is the equivalent of taking a great book that everyone knows and loves, removing all the interesting stuff, replacing it with your own invented modern dramatic elements and thrills, and stuffing it with Hollywood spectacle just to keep people entertained. Which means they thought the original story wasn't good enough. So why start with the story of Noah in the first place? Obviously, just to exploit its popularity.Examples:Let's start with the 'Watchers': There are Nefilim in the Bible, but traditional sources give them a completely different form and story. In the movie they are Transformer-like ex-angel creatures of stone that are confused and emotional, behaving like humans, that 'fell' in order to help humans, and who have lost their way after humans disappointed them. The actual story is about angels seduced by humans and fallen from grace thanks to the corruption of the earth, trying to turn themselves into humans and interacting with the human world and causing distortions and evil. In other words, they were a symptom of the general corruption of creation where even angels fell. Which is scary and interesting in itself and can even easily lend itself to a Hollywood spectacle, so why change it? Plus the change makes no sense: Why would angels 'fall' in order to help humans? In order to fall, first something has to go wrong. Also, they can help from wherever they are! All of which shows what I said earlier: Not only did they change things unnecessarily, they also made illogical changes.Another case in point: Noah was instructed to build the Ark, a job that would take 120 years. God could have made it spring up by some miracle or save Noah some other much easier way, but there was a point to make by having Noah build it in front of everyone for so long through hard work and dedication (to provoke them and give them a chance to think and see the work and correct their ways). So what does this movie do? It springs up a whole forest instantly through a huge miracle, then has the Watchers build the ark for Noah as quickly as possible, protected and hidden away from civilization, as well as has them protect Noah in a grand battle-massacre spectacle. Kinda missing the whole point aren't we?Other details:Noah here is an action-figure who does battle with evil men, killing them without remorse. Once again, Hollywood action over introspection. It's not a question over whether he had to kill due to self-defense in a land without morals, it's about on what the movie chooses to focus.And yes, once again, there is Hollywood romance and lust by the saviors of the world... In a Biblical movie about the moral deterioration of the world for crying out loud. In fact, they all do various bad things just in order to make them more human for us. And yet the Bible says they were righteous. So I guess righteous means that they were merely ahead of the rest in terms of brownie points? Except (spoiler) Noah turns out to be worse than the rest of the world...(spoilers) Noah turns out to be a misanthrope Vegan who would like to see all of humanity destroyed just so that 'nature' can be left untouched. This is really beyond offensive. For starters, besides the obvious change from the original story, this means that whereas the rest of the world were murderers, Noah would rather see animals live than a single human. Which makes him worse than the rest of the world. The immediate question is, according to this movie's warped (non)logic, why would he be saved? True, in the end he found his way to show mercy to human babies but this hardly makes him better than the rest - they didn't kill babies either (obviously, otherwise they wouldn't exist). Modern stories are often afraid of making their heroes inspiring and good people since that isn't 'realistic' and artistic, but this is taking it a bit too far don't you think? This movie actually turns Noah into a despicable evil man.Also, religiously, the world was created for man. Why on earth would Noah, a religious man, think that a world without humans made sense as long as animals get to live?! Evidently nobody put any thought into this screenplay.The care for the land by Noah and avoidance from eating animals is correct, except this is no vegetarian paradise: In the bible, right after the flood, in the new world that was created, Noah was given permission to eat animals. The movie conveniently ignores this part of the story just to create some kind of fantasy Vegan/environmentalist character.God speaks to Noah through dreams or he has to take a drug to see a vision like some Native American. Really? Way to undermine that interesting conversation with God.Traditionally, Noah was a complex mysterious character whose primary issue was over having the ability to save the rest of the world along with him and not going as far as he could. So what does this movie do? Throws all of this interesting stuff out and turns him into a Vegan fanatic. Talk about a missed opportunity.Noah fed the animals according to tradition, and had trouble with it, he didn't put them to sleep with some herb magic. Once again, a missed opportunity.Once in the ark, instead of introspection, we get a thriller subplot invented for the movie while Noah suddenly gets all misanthropic. The empty-headed changes to the story keep increasing by the dozens just to generate more cheap thrills. Imagine that: There is an apocalypse, and survivors have weeks to think about what just happened, but according to this movie, that's not enough.And so on and on... I am deeply disappointed in you, Darren Aronofsky. You had a chance to change the way Hollywood approaches Biblical movies with a rich complex story about people and humanity, and you chose a superficial, badly-written, fantasy action epic instead."
" Only fictional

" Transformers meets The Old Testament
",0.0,0.8255,2018-02-02 00:00:00,1,"I've noticed that Darren Aronofsky, the director of this clunker, has only one other film to his credit so far, another flop called Mother. Does this mean that the money men will send him the way of Michael Cimino who quietly disappeared after Heaven's Gate? Surprising as he made two pictures I loved, The Wrestler and Black Swan. What went wrong? Well I'd advise no one over the age of thirteen waste precious movie time on this dud. I was brought up on the bible stories, not that I'm religious, but this pic really has little to do with the traditional story other than the main character is called Noah and he's building an ark, which actually looks like a long oblong box. I understand from what I've read that the Transformer like rock creatures here were meant to be some kind of angels but in all honesty by the time they arrived I couldn't care less about the rest of the film and didn't really have a clue as to what was going on. Anthony Hopkins turned up as he invariably does these days, and it reminded me of all those has been British MP's who turn up at the House of Lords each day to collect their £300. I rest my case. One star out of ten as I can't go any lower. Is Russell Crowe getting hard up for a buck? Oh! and Emma Watson is just a wooden here as she was in the Harry Potter pics. Poor young lady has a long way to go to create any screen prescence I'm afraid."
" Well, at least they got the flood part right.

If you were looking for a story that relates what's in the Bible to Movie screen, you're going to be dismayed. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it a negative number star.One can only assume the people involved in this movie have never actually read the story in the Old Testament. If I were an actor, I would have refused to be in this movie. There is acting talent in this movie and it's too bad it's used in an abusive way. At least there was a flood and an Ark. Beyond that, this movie disappoints. If this movie comes on TV, make a dentist appointment and get a root canal. You'll be glad you did."
" Absolute Travesty
",-0.5719,-0.9902,2018-01-05 00:00:00,1,"I wonder what people would think if they went to watch a movie based on their favorite book only to find that everything about it had been changed to the point of absurdity.
The next Superman or Batman or Tarzan or Bond movie that comes out should maybe follow the lead of this movie and portray them all in a way that no one who knows the stories would recognize them.
That is what the producers of this so called movie have done. If I could have given no stars or a minus I would have because it changes the story line and reduces the characters to polar opposites of the way they were described in the book.
I know many movies will have artistic license but they rarely change everything.
Noah is portrayed as a confused, violent mad man who will happily kill anyone who stands in the way of his ideas, he will even kill babies, yet the Bible describes him as a righteous man, it says he was faultless among his contemporaries. It was not his decisions that he carried out but his Gods.
The Bible refers to the world being full of violence and that fallen Angels had come to earth having sexual relations with women who then had offspring that were themselves violent.These were called Nephilim and they were Giants but not big weird looking stone creatures.
The Bible also says that eight persons were saved in the Ark and these were Noah, his three sons and their respective wives. By the time the Ark was built they would have all been adults, but in this movie there is one girlfriend of Shem and a girl Ham wants to take on the Ark is left to die by his psychotic Father.
And then we find Tubal Kane manages to get on board the Ark and we find out that Noah wants to destroy all humans even though in the Bible God tells him the Ark is too preserve life. Noah also refuses anyone else onto the Ark even though the Bible says he preached to people for many years and the Ark was more than big enough for many people. The only reason no one else went into the Ark was because they were wicked and thought Noah was mad.
In this movie we see crowds of men storming the Ark and being beaten off by giant stone creatures that look like bad caricatures of the thing form the fantastic four.
Also as others have said God himself barely gets a mention in the entire movie.Anther point that annoyed me was that apparently it was only white people who lived back then and only white people who got onto the Ark, ye the Bible lists genealogies that show that for example Ham's descendants became the people of early Egypt and Africa so you would expect that either Noah's family was dark skinned and the wives were lighter skinned or the other way around, but certainly not all white with straight hair."
" Kill Me Now
",-0.6908,0.9542,2018-01-02 00:00:00,2,"This could be amusing for kids of the right age. You know: not so young as to be traumatised by a bit of blood and CGI guts, and not so old as to be particularly discerning or critical.Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly hold this production up, in the manner of a limbo bar held so close to the ground that you may as well give up.Planetary genocide is not the breeziest of settings, yet here we are, watching millennial acting talent ham it up. It's a shame said talent don't do much more than look pretty, and run around with their mouths open.A brief scene of passion between one of Noah's sons, Shem (Douglas Booth), and his adoptive daughter, Ila (Emma Watson), has all the tender fierceness of last night's leftover meatloaf. When Ila later falls pregnant and, in the heat of a family feud, her waters break and splash onto the floor, Watson merely looks like she's dropped a packet of crisps.This could be seen as a 21st century ""Never-ending Story"" type of offering, with the semi-epic look and the fantastical and predictably servile supporting creatures--but given the original story material, the conclusion can only be a ""God is good"" sort of proselytism, which is bad enough when you don't have to pay for it."

The outcome is a stupid movie that when it manages not to bore you, it makes you wonder who the hell wrote such a confusing script!On older epic movies like '56 ""The Ten Commandments"" at least there's a theatrical performance that follows the Bible story. In this movie, it's so idiotic to show the Big Bang and try to convince your audience that this is explained in the scripts. Also stupid is a dialogue inside the Arc that tries to pass the message that some species are extincted because they were eaten by some guy.There are some imaginary characters that has nothing to do with the bible, so now you have serious narration of bible combined with absolutely imaginery situations!If the editor had cut all the science references and time-lapses or the out of the bible characters and storylines, this would be at least a 5/10 boring movie for me. But they managed to mix religion with fantasy and science and this makes this movie, a 1/10 plan stupid attempt."

" Ruined
",-0.4767,-0.9691,2017-12-03 00:00:00,2,"I'm not sure where to begin, this movie went so wrong in so many ways. 1) If you're going to quote the Bible, then actually quote it. Otherwise you're going to turn off the core audience. 2) Why the need for the fallen warriors? 3) Why would they leave Logan's partner? The point of saving Noah's family is so they could repopulate the earth after the flood. 3) Why would Noah think he's supposed to kill the twins? Again, this contradicts the plot. 4) What purpose does Cain serve by being in the story? He would have to be over 2000 years old, and no one in history has ever lived that long. Not to mention that eating the animals in the ark would cause those animals to go extinct, which negates their purpose on the ark in the first place. 5) Logan's character leaves them to find his place on a planet that has just been flooded. There will be no one for him, so he'll die alone, and the earth will be less people to repopulate it. Why have him on the ark in the first place? They completely messed up this story. The only positive review I give is for the special effects. Everything else is completely illogical, especially given that it's based on one of the most important Bible stories."
" Should not be about ""Noah""
",0.0,0.9967,2017-11-22 00:00:00,7,"I'm a fan of Darren Aranofsky. I love ""Requiem for the dream"" and ""The Fountain"" so much. But for ""Noah"", I must say that it's quite a wrong decision to create it under the name of a Biblical character. Personally, I think that the theme of this movie is not bad at all, it's just that you have to make a separate movie, because if you create something based on the Bible, at least better give the character and the original story some respect. At least you have to keep the main message. Actually, I really enjoyed the first half of the film and the addition of characters like the giants or Noah's grandfather. It doesn't destroy the story and the good message of the original Noah story. I also like the way creation of the world is told. But after half way, the story is such a mess. The son and daughter-in-law issues, the evil man who has sneaked into the ark eating away some of the animals, the insanity of Noah and his misinterpretation of God's will that make him want to kill his own grandchildren. All of these should not be in the story of ""Noah"" because, according to the Bible, Noah is a man of God, the few good ones left on the surface of the Earth who could really hear what God tells him to do. According to the Bible, Noah and ""all"" of his family (in-laws included) are on the ark. Noah tried to warn everyone for years about the flood but no one listened to him. He didn't try to block other people from getting into the ark. He is hopeful about human's future and was expecting dry land so that he, his family, and the animals can settle down again. I know that a movie is a piece of artwork and the story can have additions and points of view according to the filmmaker, but at least it should not make people confused about who Noah is in the Bible. But still, there are some aspects that I like about the film. How sin infiltrates human, how beings of light can get stuck in Earthly form as punishment, and how human is supposed to have stewardship over other creatures on Earth, to care for them and not to destroy. The idea that God doesn't want to erase all mankind but to give a new beginning and a new hope. The performance of the cast was flawless in my eyes and the special effects are OK too. The movie is a bit slow-pace but that didn't bother me. I just simply didn't like how the filmmaker twist the story too much that it doesn't do respect to the original theme and character of Biblical Noah story."
" Cohesive, ingenious, inspiring and moving
",0.4215,0.9868,2017-10-31 00:00:00,10,"It maybe says something that this film has been quite regularly derided and panned, when it in fact has so very much to offer.For me - perhaps alone in the world - this is a good film, easily holding its own with any Biblical epic from early eras that you can think of.As a bonus, it has a flavour of dystopian sci fi (""The Road"" and others) about it, contrasting the good personified by Noah and his wife (ably played, with conviction, by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly), and their family; with the rest of humanity turned to industrialisation and environmental despoilation, violence, lack of care, evil of all kinds, even cannibalism.And of course it tells the Bible story most beloved of kids (perhaps kids of all ages) for thousands of years. Which kid has not marvelled at pictures of the Ark, or built a mini one for him/herself? It was one of my abiding passions more years ago now than I care to remember.Here there is no detracting from the Biblical story, yet where and when necessary that story is reinforced in its cohesiveness, with deft directorial touches from Darren Aronofksy. The development of the paradise in which the Ark is built and then the arrival of successive waves of animals is surely affecting to any who are not made of stone? It's hugely elemental and meaningful in a manner that is beyond criticism ... or indeed derision. In general, the special effects are more than adequate for the purpose, and to moan about the slightly bandwagon-following ""Stone Giants"" seems churlish. When all's said and done, how do we know what a fallen angel looks like? Yet, beautifully enough, Noah's muscular godliness, absolute goodness and determination to serve, no matter what, blinds him in a way that the slightly more-nuanced convictions of his more down-to-earth wife will not allow. Humanly, her love of family exceeds her faith in God - a tricky call in Old Testament terms, as we know. Yet ultimately she makes her stubborn man see reason, and this is a nice touch in the middle of all the black v white stuff, inspiring as that often proves to be.Anthony Hopkins with his huge screen presence is in there as a very impressive Methuselah (Noah's grandfather), and - personally speaking - I found profoundly moving a tiny Brit-with-Brit scene in which he encounters and ""heals"" the daughter (as played by Emma Watson) that his grandson has adopted and raised, who is infertile due to injury. This is one of the best parts I have seen Emma take (which may not be saying that much), but she certainly presents her age-old predicament touchingly and powerfully enough here.The film comes in at over 2 hours, while the number of lines devoted to this tale in The Bible is not great. But it always was a marvellous story (conceivably with a grain of end-of-Ice Age truth about it), and this film version does all it can to convey that tale with warmth and conviction, and with a specific mix of majesty and humility."

I think the script writer didn't bother to read the original story, or did, but decided to rewrite it entirely, just keeping the name Noah, and the ark as a token. the original talks about Noah and his wife and his three sons and their wives entering the ark, whereas this piece of fiction's entire premise is on something else. And fallen angels as rock-monsters helping to build the ark! someone was really desperate to add some extra special effects. I think this is a mockery of the original story, and feel sorry for people not familiar with it who think this film has anything to do with it. if you want ""biblical fiction"" then Ben Hur is a million times better, without the pretension of being a real bible story. the acting was OK, but if you're going to make up a story, let's not pretend it follows it's namesakes story, just to cash in on ""bible epics""."

I enjoyed the film, and made me read the whole story as written in a Bible I have (edition from 1840.....is this why modern readers say it DIFFERS ? I guess modern/shorter versions are around which simplifly the story leaving out GIANTS and other ancient archetypes ?) Guess what ? It's EXACTLY like the film, including the giants and angels ....I was actually surprised at how literally the director had transcribed it , and I was intrigued by the Bible-story very much. Yes it is almost SF as some say, but not the film, it's just WRITTEN like that. Noah is even more cold then how the actor plays him. And it gives no reason for his all last years of living in total isolation and penitance AFTER they arrive in their new land. Guess what ? Aranofsky took here the only liberty I can see , and did so only to give a psychological reason for the WHY ( Noah sinned of arrogance, since he'd forbidden his children to take their love-interest along , and indeed this is not so loving , he behaved strictly conceptually without compassion as his wife showed him. Anyway, this is the ONLY liberty of the film I encountered. And a good one, because reading the OTestament leaves you wondering indeed ""But WHY did he end up living separated from his family in a cave ???""..............The director showed the relation of that cold decision and the penitence he took for it, which is a good move IMO. And the rest ? You'd be surprised how much 'SF' is to be found in an ancient Bible !! Well done, a deserved 8."
" Violates the Biblical account
",-0.5106,0.9179,2017-09-18 00:00:00,1,"I really have no clue why Mr Aronofsky had the need to twist the Biblical account the way he did, while there are parts where it shows that he knows, or must know, what is actually written in the Bible. And so here, there is this twist that while in the Ark, Mr Aronofsky's Noah, and not the Noah in the Bible, gets this idea that he should kill the newborn children of one of his sons wives, but only if they are girls But in the end he relents, thinking he disappointed God, because he couldn't do it because of the love he felt for his own grand children. And also this one, right at the beginning just after the birds get into the Ark, the snakes move in. Which in symbolic way means, that all the lying prophets force their way into churches, trying to get to heaven to be saved, while they deceive everyone else. So beware of false movie script writers. All this has to do with ""the man of lawlessness"", see 2Th2 in the Bible.However, once you know the Holy Scripture it is a good practice to watch movies and trying to figure out where the message gets twisted, again as a good practice to discern false teachings. I did this a lot, and it is fun, kind of because you can also feel sad why these people have this need to twist biblical accounts the way they do.John 15:26 and 16,John 15:26 (NIV 1984)26 When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me. 27 And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning. 1 ""All this I have told you so that you will not go astray. 2 They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God. 3 They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. 4 I have told you this, so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you.

" A bad retelling of Noah's Arch
",-0.5423,-0.4072,2017-08-16 00:00:00,3,"Because of human greed and wickedness, the whole world is mostly destroyed, so The Creator decides to eliminate all evil through a massive flood. At his instructions, a faithful servant of his by the name of Noah must build a huge arch which will carry two animals of each race in order to repopulate Earth after the cataclysm. Together with his family and a group of banished angels, he begins work as soon as possible but a large group of corrupt humans is not going to make their task easy.This movie is an adaptation of the apocalypse from the bible with some big differences which manage only make it a lot worse. I was tempted to believe that such a cast cannot make a bad movie but I was more than wrong. It's characters are, to say the least, retarded! It seems like almost every action they make is intentionally done to contradict any logic and common sense, acting like they had absolutely no idea why they were there. The events are as forced as they can get, and I'm not referring here to the natural event. There's a scene where a one legged human struggles to climb a huge framing and starts to hit the wooden barge with an ax, barely making any damage while the water was a couple of seconds away, while in the next five seconds he manages to enter it without any water coming inside. The same human is able to stay in the same place for about an year, undetected and almost without any wounds, eventually confronting Noah in a melee combat. Simply unbelievable... Exaggerations like this are something common so if you're a bit picky, like I am, you might even find your intelligence insulted.The only upside of this movie can be its visuals but they don't excel in any way. To say this is a bad movie would be a compliment for it, unfortunately"

The 'ark' looked like a bunch of toothpicks stuck together. If I remember correctly, 'Noah' wore 21st century jeans in one scene. Strange. I felt emotionally distant from this movie, more so as it proceeded.I was glad when this mess of a film was over."
" Nothing to do with the Biblical story, just the name
",0.0,0.882,2017-07-07 00:00:00,4,"As long as you watch this as some type of Titan off shoot from Greek mythology, you can enjoy the movie. It's entertaining enough and the special effects are pretty good, but I have to give it a low rating because it pretends to be a retelling of the biblical tale and many who do not know or read the bible will think it is. Call me paranoid, but I often fear that's the agenda. Beyond the name Noah, a flood, and the transport of animals, this is a mythological tale based on Hollywood writers' imagination nothing more. Whether you are religious or not, you cannot adapt a move from biblical text with this much creative license and still call it Noah. Enjoy this movie as a long lost Greek mythological tale or a transformers movie where the ancient transformers help out a local human to build a boat and save humanity, but don't even consider this biblical in anyway."

" Different biblical movie that fails to better the genre
",0.0258,0.9818,2017-06-22 00:00:00,3,"Noah is a biblical epic that's not particularly attached the source material, something made abundantly clear with the appearance of its Transformers-like rock monsters. Hollywood has often expanded on the stories in the bible, adding details to make its short, expositional stories more engaging. But they have rarely used the ""loosely based on"" approach of Noah.Unfortunately, while the approach is different in some ways, the movie also has the slow, ponderous quality of many old testament film spectacles, only even more ponderous, slow, and pretentious. It's as though the director watched the worst of 50s-era bible movies and said, with modern technology, I can make something much worse than this.Is this slow, soggy mess really Darren Aronofsky? That's the name on the credits, yet this is not the movie you'll want to watch if you are looking for a Darren Aronofsky-style film. And if you're looking for a big-budget epic, well, even the big ""setting sail"" scene is no more than okay.After the tedious first half hour I started skipping forward, which gave me a chance to see the aforementioned sailing scene, the one excellent moment of the movie, the evolution scene (just watch it on youtube), and the film's dark take on Noah. Nothing I saw made me want to actually watch the rest of this.Departing from biblical source material was not, in itself, a bad idea. I liked the idea of God communication visually through dreams, and of people saying ""creator"" instead of ""God,"" and it was interesting to see a creature that didn't make it onto the ark. But the movie doesn't really have much to say about anything and is less entertaining than any hokey old Cecile B DeMille picture.With a director as brilliant as Aronofsky, it's tempting to watch even their worst movies to see if there's a spark of brilliance. But watching this is on a par with watching David Lynch's Dune. Don't do it."

Paramount should have fired the ... uhm ... (we'll say illiterate for niceness) who apparently can't read a book and hired a producer (and writer, and director) who can actually read. No idea how he found a Toll to bend over for him to pull this toll-crap out of. I will avoid any more 'based on' movies with the name 'Darren Aronofsky' attached anywhere to it!

" A flawed yet entertaining Biblical epic
",0.4404,0.9982,2017-06-07 00:00:00,7,"I was really not sure what to expect from Noah going into it. I knew that the reception for it was, polarizing at best, I had never seen any Darren Aronofsky movie so I was not familiar with his style or camera tricks, and I was unsure if the film would move me on an emotional level. And, I found myself entertained by it.First things first, the acting. I think Russell Crowe delivered a very strong performance as Noah, he really sold me as both a father, and as God's chosen man to build the ark. It's probably not an easy role to play, but I think Russell Crowe managed pretty well. Jennifer Connelly was very good as Naoh's wife Naameh. Anthony Hopkins was basically playing Anthony Hopkins, so, I really don't have anything more to add there. Ray Winstone does a very good job as a scenery-chewing villain who I thought was pretty entertaining. He wasn't 100% believable, but to be fair when you have a movie where a guy builds a floating zoo for every animal in the world with his family to survive a giant rainstorm, I think that's acceptable. The younger actors are more problematic, however. I thought Logan Lerman was pretty flat, though to be fair I don't think he had that much to work with, Douglas Booth was sometimes a little over-the-top, and Emma Watson was fine. She wasn't spectacular, but she did okay with the material.Another element which I liked was the pre-flood landscape. The film was shot in Iceland, and Darren Aronofsky used some really interesting locations that I haven't really seen much before. It was very smart by Aronofsky to use more fantasy-like landscapes instead of iconic contemporary locations in order to sell the world. That element is very well handled.Speaking of the world-building, I think Aronofsky did a good job of portraying why humanity is so corrupt and violent, which is very important because his job is to sell to me that humanity is at such a bad state that God is willing to kill everyone except six or eight people. And I thought it was handled very well.The biggest problem for me was honestly the visual effects. I didn't think they looked very good, to be perfectly honest. I mean, they're fine on their own, but I think in order to sell the movie you need some truly breathtaking visual effects, and that was simply not the case. Some of the stuff with the rock monsters looked like stop-motion, and some of the stuff with the animals were pretty unconvincing.I should probably dress the religious controversies surrounding the film. Paramount tested three different versions of Noah to different religious groups, without Aronofsky's involvement or knowledge, all three of which to negative reviews. Then, Paramount decided ""screw it, were just gonna release Darren's cut of the movie"", and that is the version that was released. And there was a lot of controversy surrounding the film's accuracy to the bible which turned some people off. Now I am not a religious person, I'm an atheist in fact, I haven't read the Bible and certainly not the stuff about Noah, so perhaps with all that going in, I didn't mind the liberties Aronofsky and screenwriter Ari Handel took with the source material. If the film was 100% faithful to the bible, it would probably be a very boring film, and I do think Aronofsky tried to be as faithful as they possibly could while at the same time trying to make an entertaining adventure movie, I mean this is a $130 million movie after all. And Aronofsky's responsibilities as a filmmaker is primarily to entertain, but also make a movie that's interesting to make it accessible to non-religious people, like me.So overall, You could say it's a mixed review, I liked Crowe's Connelly's and Winstone's performances, I liked the design of the world and use of locations, I disliked the performances of some the younger actors, some of the visual effects were unconvincing and fake-looking.My final score, 7/10."
" Not your Noah story from Sunday school.
",0.0,0.3384,2017-05-20 00:00:00,8,"I would just like to point out that most people who hate on this film are doing so because it includes many elements that don't appear in the Bible version of the story of Noah. Everyone seems to assume that the screenplay was constructed by stretching a two-page fable into a two-hour epic, and that simply is not the case. The plot and content of this movie draw on the extensive Hebrew mythology surrounding the story of Noah and the flood. For example, many reviewers her on IMDb are outraged that the movie includes stone giants that are nowhere to be found in Biblical texts; however, these nephilim are an integral part of the traditional Hebrew flood story (Google ""Shamchazai and Azael""). I found the movie to be extremely entertaining and thoughtful, and I am sure that it would be rated much higher if everyone wasn't watching it with a preconceived notion of what the story IS and ISN't."

Hollywood thought it could do a movie about a religious icon from the history books and create it like its either Game of Thrones or Harry Potter. I thought Russell Crowe didn't do a good job as playing Noah because he looked too young and just played too much of a ""daddy"" role than a ""grandfather"". Maybe if they gave him heavy makeup or have an older person like Ian McKellen to play the part. Either way, it would make the film look better. I'm surprised that it was nominated a golden globe because I honestly didn't think this movie wasn't at all good and it was pretty effortless. Im giving this 2/10........."
" Well made adaptation of the Bible story
",0.2732,0.9949,2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Believers BEWARE!!!! I'm gonna be perfectly honest and blunt: deeply devout Christians will not like this film, they just won't. And it's not because it's a poorly made movie, it's not because the acting is bad or the effects are bad, it's because it's not true to the Bible at all. Now to me it makes absolutely no difference whether the movie is true to its source material since I'm not a religious person and I'm just looking for an entertaining well put together fictional story. And that is precisely what I got. And I've actually heard from Christians talking about the movie that Hollywood had to take leaps and fill in the gaps somehow because the story of Noah is so short in the Bible. It probably would've been pretty boring too if they only would've stuck to the Bible. The thing that I love the most about this movie is the performances! Jennifer Connelly is the best in the film, I mean WOW, I was blown away by her powerful performance, there is one scene in particular where her dramatic acting chops are really shown. Crowe is a good Noah, a lot of times his character is just very blank looking and almost in a trans because he must ""follow the creator"", but Russel plays it well. I adored Emma Watson in her role, this movie really showed how talented an actress she really is. And lastly Logan Lerman is very mature and you can see how he's growing as an actor here. The story is very interesting and I was so curious and invested the whole way through. I loved the liberties Darren took, like with ""the watchers"". The movie has a well written script too. All in all it's an interesting film that I do recommend but to all deeply religious Christians out there: you probably won't like it. 8/10."
" An Honest Review
",0.5106,0.9697,2017-04-21 00:00:00,5,"I feel obligated to watch and review movies like this. I am just happy as a clam that they make movies based on real life or mythological things simply because it gets people interested in it.I mean, I'm a historian...one that has spent his life walking that fine line between history, geology, and a Catholic faith...They never agree.Don't worry, I don't care about how historically accurate movies are and being a historian I play lip service to the presumed accuracy of my religion....And as someone with a deep understanding of geology, when it comes to even 5,000 years ago I play lip service to my own profession.I think it's hysterical that people are hating on this film for religious reasons. ""Noah"" is largely Biblically inaccurate, which is even funnier than usual given that every Priest I've ever had recognizes Noah as Gilgamesh.So to hate it on a religious stance is idiotic to begin with...and to hate a totally religiously inaccurate film simply because it's based on a tale from the Abrahamic Holy books is as idiotic because, well, it's not even accurate to those.So we'll erase all the Religious and history crap now and just look at the movie.If you didn't see this in the theater and if you don't have a, well, an Ark sized TV...it might not be worth it.The main selling point is really watching the Great Flood, the Deluge is sort of why people like me want to see it...and we want to see it BIG. HUGE. ENORMOUS.So...a small screen and you might as well be watching abrupt History Channel ""The Bible"" miniseries...and just leave it at that.In fact, you may be better off passing if you don't watch it big...because without the enormity of the flood on the enormous screen you are left with Russell Crowe and that just hurts.Yup...Russell Crowe. What you have here, minus the flood (which is the star of the show) is Crowe, a man that is so convinced that he is God's gift to acting that he totally forgot how to do it.I don't care how you feel about religion (as long as you tolerate all of them) and I don't care how you feel about accuracy in film...no matter your feelings you have to endure Crowe.If you can do that more power to you.But then you have Jennifer Connelly and yeah, you may think she's still eye candy--and you would be right--but that doesn't change the fact that she still can't emote.Thankfully you have Watson, who manages to out act both of them...and Hopkins if he really had a role in all of this worth his skills.So if you have the means to watch it big...the flood is worth the price of admission...if you don't beware of the Crowe."

With the help of the fallen angels, society developed but then degenerated into brutal tribes. The angels themselves were banned by the humans and the higher power decided to restart the whole Earth project, because his creatures were nasty, cruel and disrespecting their planet.Noah and family living in a post-apocalyptic landscape, are apparently the only decent human beings left around. One night Noah gets a dream pointing in the direction of the ending of humankind. Noah decides he must consult his grandfather MethuselahMethuselah played by Antony Hopkins, looks straight out of a Lord of the Rings movie, has a few words of wisdom and a magic seed to deliver. It takes ten years to build the ark with trees sprouted from the magic seed, so perhaps the prophecy was not that urgent.Closer to departure date, wild tribesmen, guided by a despicable Ray Winstone, approach Noah and his ark and demand to board. This request is obviously denied. In the meantime, the animals are boarding of their own free will and are sedated for safe passage.The ark sets off with a twist that implies some very difficult moral decisions to take. Noah believes all humankind is corrupted and the planet would be better left alone, without inherently evil humans walking on it. Considering how vile is the Winstone character, it is difficult to argue with that.After a dramatic plot twist the movie finally ends with some sort of solace. What you get is some amazing scenes - especially about the creation, some disturbing violence and the more disturbing feeling that things aren't that good nowadays.Mass-scale cruelty against nature and its creatures is still going on and humankind does sort of suck. Noah encourages reflection but I would not watch it again."
" Not The Noah I Grew Up Reading About
",0.0,-0.9717,2017-03-02 00:00:00,1,"Whether you believe the biblical story of Noah's Ark to be truth or fiction, few could dispute that it is quite a fantastic tale. I mean, a giant flood, two of every animal, and epic themes of man's wickedness. Ready-made for Hollywood, right? When the trailers first started hitting for this movie quite a while back, I thought it would be a surefire hit. The one kink I hadn't expected: Darren Aronofsky's complete and utter incompetence in deciphering what this movie experience should have been about.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Noah (Russell Crowe), who is told by the ""Creator"" (or God) to build an ark to survive a flood that will wipe nearly all of wicked humanity off of the planet while saving the animals and righteous few. So, Noah along with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and sons (Douglas Booth, Logan Lerman), sets out to complete the task. An orphan girl (played by Emma Watson) also joins the crew. Nothing is ""smooth sailing"" about building the Ark, however, as Noah is constant tormented by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), leader of the ravenous human colonies.The only positive thing I can say about ""Noah""? It had an epic feel to it. That is clear right from the beginning. Oh yeah, and Emma Watson steals basically every scene that she is in. However, Aronofsky screws things up so many times that by the end it turns into quite a mess. For example...-Introducing the concept of the Nephilim (fallen Angels) is interesting...but not as rock-creatures that resemble the Ents from the Lord of the Rings. A terrible choice right from the get-go. -The entire concept behind Noah and is Ark has NOTHING to do with environmentalism (no matter how much you try to force it, Darren). Men were not wicked because they were eating meat. They were wicked because they perverted God's ways and created a cesspool of humanity. Also, God did NOT value the animals over the humans. God basically just wanted to ""start over"" with two of each species, man or beast. It has nothing to do with the animals being ""purer"" than men. -The biggest problem of the entire film, though, is how Aronofsky intimates that Noah thinks God wants ALL humanity to die, even going so far as to put the fate of future offspring in doubt. There is NOTHING in the Bible that suggests this whatsoever, and even as a ""dramatized concept"" it is stupid. To put it simply, God recognized that only the line of Noah remained pure in heart and devoted to him, so he saved Noah's line along with the general eco-system (animals) of Earth in order to ""wipe the slate clean"". The purpose most assuredly was NOT to wipe humans off the face of the planet.It has been quite a while since I have been let down quite this much by a film that I thought would have so much more potential. Shame on you, Darren Aronofsky, for almost single- handedly destroying what could have been an epic masterpiece. It saddens me that you were unable to stick to the story itself (which would have provided enough drama for anyone else) and instead had to inject your high-handed ideals into the mix. You ruined it."
" Original, but I expected something different and the movie shocks with that expectation.
",-0.4118,0.9737,2017-03-01 00:00:00,4,"Biblical themes are always pleasing in the movies, but they're also complex and require some care and attention. This Darren Aronofsky's was technically well done. The CGI allows for great scenes and extraordinary sequences, such as the creation of the world or the flood itself, mixing the biblical text with scientific facts we know today. Cinematography is great, with alternating moments of light and shadow, serving the purpose of characterizing and giving personality to the two opposing factions (the sons of Cain and the sons of Seth). Clint Mansell's soundtrack is equally impressive, creates a good ambiance and gives intensity in the right moments. The actors also did a good job, particularly the antagonistic duet Russell Crowe / Ray Winstone. They're very related to each other because they're the mirror of each other, insofar as one is all that the other isn't. The remaining cast is more restrained, allowing them to have some deserved protagonism. Anthony Hopkins appears in a small role but to which he conferred dignity. ""There are no small roles, there are little actors,"" isn't it? The worst of this movie? Two things: the first is to disappoint the expectations of the public. Whole movie seems a huge metaphor, as if the elements on scene were symbols meant to update the story and bring it closer to our reality. Taking the most striking example of this, the cities of the people of Cain are so savage and cruel that they seem to be dystopian metaphors of our great metropolis. If this was the director/writer's idea, then it's something quite original, but it shocked with all the expectations we might have, and, when that happens, it's so dangerous as a double-edged sword, as the audience can Not understand the intentions of the director. Even I was expecting something else, and even though I recognize the originality of the film, I still feel sorry for not being quite what I expected. The second problem of the film is those fallen angels invented by the director and surely influenced by the story of the angels revolt and their fall to the world. It was a bad idea for the director."

Poor Ham wasn't left out of the mating loop, and Japheth was the oldest son, not the youngest. I don't mind adding some characters from the Apocryphal books, but the earth was NEVER barren before the flood. The weather was always good, and it never rained. All the water was held either in the Firmament or in the Great Pools Of The Deep. The movie gratuitously showed Noah drunk and naked near the end, not knowing what the meaning of ""uncovered his father's nakedness means"". Since Jennifer Connelly gave a convincing performance as a woman who would do ANYTHING for her children, I think the incest between Ham and his mother would have been convincing even in this bastardized plot. And it was the Ham's son Canaan, who was cast out, not Ham. Otherwise, they should have titled the movie, Noah, An Alternative Universe."

",0.0,0.9661,2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"I just saw this film, and while I don't consider it to be one of Aranofsky's best it was certainly enjoyable. I felt the major characters were well-acted, and I think that Aranofsky's take on the moral burden placed upon Noah is in many respects more interesting than the spartan account one finds in Genesis.In interest of full disclosure, I should point out that I am not even remotely religious, and as such am more interested in the story itself than biblical accuracy.That being said, though, I am actually rather perplexed by the number of reviews which have taken issue with inconsistencies between the film and the usual Christian interpretation of the flood story.This is an odd position to take since Aranofsky is neither religious nor Christian -- he was raised in the Jewish tradition and while Christianity and Judaeism may share the same source materials, they in many cases have very different interpretations of these sources. Moreover, there is a great deal of material present in Jewish folklore which isn't directly mentioned in Biblical texts.The Nephilim (aka the Watchers aka the big stone monsters aka 'the giants' in the KJV), for example, may receive only passing mention in the opening verses of the Noah narrative, and are generally ignored altogether in Christian accounts. As a gentile, however, I really have no idea how this notion is fleshed out in Jewish traditions and what role the Nephilim play in Jewish traditions.I'd be very interested in reading more reviews of this title from a Jewish rather than a Christian perspective, since it is presumably the Jewish view which informs Aranofsky's take on this narrative."
