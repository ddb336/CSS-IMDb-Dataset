" Too many pulled punches!!!!
",0.0,0.9624,2021-02-07 00:00:00,5,"I went into this expecting not ip man 1 or 2 but flashpoint, killzone type fight scenes...sadly I wasn't given that the fifth scenes were choreographed great at certain points, but they held back to much I didn't get the face crushing action I had hoped, little too much wire work without an Aggressive delivery of pain to add to wire fighting with unnecessary CGi, great story with incredible homages to the greats of the genre, just wasn't the Donnie Yen movie I was expecting, great cinematography of the city and glorious high definition but just not the face crushing jamboree you'd expect. Still a good watch but don't have your expectations too high"
" Donnie's still got it.
",0.0,0.6914,2021-01-10 00:00:00,7,"Kung fu instructor Hahou Mo (Donnie Yen) is serving a prison sentence for the accidental death of an opponent during a duel. When he sees a news report on the prison TV about the murder of a top martial artist, he believes that he can help the police to find the person responsible (who turns out to be a highly skilled fighter with a gimpy leg, as played by Baoqiang Wang).While not exactly boasting the most inspired or original of plots (the story is reminiscent of all those old school kung fu films in which a villainous martial artist kills the good guys to prove he's number one), Kung Fu Killer is still a case of Donnie Yen proving to his detractors that he's still got it. Almost two and a half decades after he wowed audiences in In the Line of Duty IV, he is more than capable of choreographing and performing jaw-dropping scenes of martial arts mayhem.I admit I was a tad doubtful at first, the initial fight scenes not grabbing me in the way I had hoped, but with each successive battle getting more and more elaborate and increasingly brutal, the film eventually won me over, the final showdown on a busy freeway being an incredible tour-de-force of kung fu excellence (with a truly wonderful spot of pole fighting midway). Admittedly, the fights are not without their use of CGI and wirework, but that's become fairly standard for modern action films, and the technology is used well in this instance. I for one am just happy to see Donnie still leaping about and doing what he does best. May he long continue to do so."
" Good but, dissapointing.
",0.2382,-0.9619,2020-12-21 00:00:00,7,"I love hong kong martial arts and Kung fu movies so, when i found out about this movie I thought it looked awsome.
After I watched it I was a little dissapointed. I wasn't expecting a great plot but I was expecting great action. Instead I got about 4 fight scenes that lasted about 2 minutes each besides the climax.
Though the badass climax makes up for anything missing I was still a little dissapointed. I woudnt recommend this film for anyone besides Kung fu movie affictionados."
" Death by boredom...

One of the best movies I have seen"
" Pure action
",0.0,0.7906,2020-07-04 00:00:00,7,"The story is good but the action is 10/10, perfect choreography, just a mix between classic martial art with moderns moves."
" Killer Kung Fu.
",-0.875,-0.9929,2020-06-05 00:00:00,6,"After watching Drug War I decided to check on Shudder to see what other Chinese movies they have. Knowing him for Rogue One,I was happy to spot a Donnie Yen title,leading me to get set for some wicked Kung-Fu.View on the film:High- kicking the killer karate chopping up a body count, the screenplay by co-writer/(with Tin Shu Mak and Ho-Leung Lau) director Teddy Chan takes the enticingly odd outline of a serial killer who murders with his Kung-Fu skills,and sadly sands it down with a miss-judged,too serious tone, hacking back to the ghosts that haunt criminal turned investigator Hahou Mo, rather than going for the more off-beat offering of the killer targeting people who are each experts in different forms of martial arts.Twisting out of the straight line style of the script, director Chan & John Woo's HK-era cinematographer Wing-Hang Wong unleash a barrage of ultra-stylised,peculiar action set-pieces,crunching bones onto and inside a human skeleton the size of a T-Rex dinosaur fossil (!) and the final,full-on fight between Hahou Mo, (played by a great, no nonsense Donnie Yen) and the killer sliding between slick wide-shots catching the duo use the environment around them for weapons, and burning red close-ups on Hahou unleashing killer Kung-Fu."
" Keep the WIRES out of Kung Fu!!
",-0.7418,-0.9866,2020-05-17 00:00:00,6,"I really am sick and tired of these kung fu movies with all the wires and CGI. I was just Googling today to see if Jet Li had ever made a movie with no CGI nonsense? I couldn't find one. I would rather watch any Bruce Lee movie with bad dubbing and fight noises with actual fighting over most all the nonsense of today. The Ip Man movies one and two were really good about that but it seems for some reason they are all hung up on this horrible wiring idea and stupid CGI. Just be realistic. Nobody gets hit and flies 20 feet across a room. Nobody jumps up to do a roundhouse kick and throws 7 kicks in between the one main kick. Just keep it real! I don't think I'm the only one who finds it ridiculous and annoying!
Keep the wires out of kung fu! Don't ruin it. Still worth the watch just because of Donnie!"
" One of Donnie Yen's Best Films
",0.6369,-0.9403,2020-04-26 00:00:00,7,"A solid martial arts movie elevated by the lead performances, Kung Fu Jungle (Kung Fu Killer in some areas) boasts some serious fight choreography. Donnie Yen stages some next-level fight scenes while giving a great starring performance at the same time.Donnie Yen is undoubtedly one of the best kung fu stars out there. He's actually a good actor, and that, coupled with his amazing fighting skills, make him a very bankable action star. His knowledge and skill in martial arts takes center stage, with some incredible fights, many of which showcase different styles of martial arts. Baoqiang Wang is actually really good as the antagonist, managing to appear imposing and intimidating despite his small height. He also displays much skill in martial arts, and he and Yen both do some great stunt work.The story is ok, and basically just a standard serial killer thriller plot with a kung fu twist, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. It was enjoyable though, and held my attention.The fight scenes are way cool. The prison fight scene is excellent and very well-staged, and the many fights between Wang and his victims were all really slick. There were also some cool chase scenes that were tightly shot and well-edited. The final fight is a treat for martial arts fans, and Yen and Wang give it their best. Pure kung fu mayhem.I strongly recommend this to Eastern cinema fans, and kung fu enthusiasts. You get what you came for, which is Yen and Wang, and lots of fighting. Nothing more, nothing less."
" A very good movie.. prob one of the better ones out there.
",0.7264,0.964,2020-03-06 00:00:00,9,"To all the reviewers trashing this movie, i bet y'all thought many parts of the Ip Man(1) movie was wack also... THIS IS A DONNIE YEN MOVIE. He does what he does best.. action.. y'all might as well go back and watch them 60-80's kungfu flick where they fought slow as hell and the action was bogus as hell also.. I mean sure Donnie used CGI in this film, BUT he did it fantastically, not like some of the other works people put out there where you can notice the cgi without having to really look at it. I mean sure it could have been a tad bit better, but this is a great film... Like majority of the reviewer, I'd recommend this movie 100% if you love action movies and donnie yen.Ps: don't come barking up my door, y'all could have left it at ""this movie isn't really my cup of tea,"" But y'all had to go trash it..."
" Worth watching serial killer/martial arts
",0.2263,0.8573,2020-02-26 00:00:00,8,Pretty decent kind of over the top right scenes throughout and I really enjoyed the storyline. Then the final fight scene and ending 20-30mins really is very good. Def watch for Donnie yen n martial arts fans
" Negativity ain't no good, this film is bloody awesome
",-0.3855,0.9891,2019-02-23 00:00:00,10,"Kung Fu Killer aka Kung Fu Jungle is an absolutely brilliant Martial Arts Thriller. The film is awesome and also is loaded with very tense and great action and has absolutely brilliant fight scenes. The fight scenes are fast, extremely powerful, absolutely amazing and brilliant and I just loved watching them in this film. The final fight scene with Donnie Yen against the extremely dangerous, malicious and insane maniac Fung Yu Sau was fast, absolutely brilliant and awesome. The fight moves were awesome to watch and see and I loved watching them and I really loved watching this film. This film also had some excellent acting by Donnie Yen, Baoqiang Wang, Charlie Yeung, Michelle Bai, Alex Fong, Louis Fan and Yanneng Shi. Donnie Yens films have some absolutely brilliant and extremely powerful fight scenes, are absolutely brilliant, and should not be looked down upon Not too long ago I watched the Donnie Yen film Flashpoint and I loved watching it and thought it was an absolutely brilliant film and I also think that this film Kung Fu Killer is an absolutely brilliant film."
" boring and Pathetic..watch for action fights kung fu..acting direction Worst.

" Nothing
",0.0,-0.8867,2018-12-26 00:00:00,1,"Unfortunately I had to abbort. Bad camera, stupid story, not bad, but NO acting, boring as hell.
Just... Nothing."
" FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE
",0.0,-0.9819,2018-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Hahou Mo (Donnie Yen) is the world's best Kung Fu fighter. He is in jail for killing his opponent. When a high profile murder occurs of a Kung Fu fighter, Hahou offers his services to capture the killer as he names the next victims. When one of those names becomes the next victim, Hahou is sprung and helps out.The serial killer was done orderly. There were no real twists, although the film could of had one, it simply isn't in the nature of the Chinese film makers. The fighting was realistic as compared to the silly grunt style and anti-gravity style of other films. The film asks the question of martial arts being outdated for killing.The only real question left unanswered was why does UPS model its uniforms from Chinese prisons suit?"
" Fantastic Movie
",0.5574,-0.2551,2018-09-01 00:00:00,9,"Donnie Yen is just fantastic in all he does from IP man to the numerous releases in the last 10
Years and this doesn't disappoint, great action
And great storyline!"
" Like Wine
",0.3612,0.7003,2018-06-12 00:00:00,10,"A tribute to good old HK cinema and its people, from a director who is as good
wine, maturing by passing years. The last minutes changed 7 to 10."
" Epic fight scenes!
",-0.4389,0.9593,2018-06-04 00:00:00,9,"I stumbled across this movie while channel surfing so I missed the first 30 minutes, but it had me hooked. Fantastic fight scenes with outstanding choreography! Some small amounts of wire work, but plenty of action showcasing the physical abilities of the actors, The final fight scene is one of the best I've seen in many years and had me transfixed from start to finish. i would happily watch this again multiple times."
" If you really want a top level martial arts movie
",0.3962,0.9516,2017-12-30 00:00:00,10,"Don't listen to the rating here, 6.5 is probably because this movie isn't dramatic enough or tear rising for some guys or something like that.
Who ever watches Donnie Yen movies does it because of his outstanding beautiful martial arts abilities, i can't believe this guy is 54 now ( 51-52 while doing this film).If you want a pure and full action hand to hand to knife to sticks to basically everything combat - watch this film!"
