" Respect for telling a story that hasn't been told before
",0.4767,-0.5006,2021-04-02 00:00:00,6,"As in the title, I respect the movie for showing us something that we are not used to seeing on screen - but is an important part of our lives and that is child soldiers in Africa. I believe the movie could have been more horrifying to be realistic and I felt things leading up to the redemption were a little rushed."
" First netflix movie I really enjoyed.
",0.5563,0.6597,2021-03-12 00:00:00,8,"Most netflix movies are nonsense. Amazing storytelling, strong acting."
" Beasts is such an emotional roller coaster that you'd be forgiven for missing a number of things.
",0.3182,-0.9928,2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,"A woman is captured by boy soldiers. In a drug-induced state, one of the boys mistakes her for his mother and embraces her. He then rejects her and calls her a witch. Before his comrades can finish raping her, he executes her. If you can allow the overwhelming horror of this scene to subside, you may realize that this woman represents all women, whether they be from a war-torn nation or a peaceful one. In the space of 5 minutes, she is a mother to be valued, a trickster to be judged, a body to be abused and finally, a problem to be rid of.A revolutionary is told to wait for his meeting with the supreme commander. But first, a foreign businessman will have his meeting. After this, another foreign businessman will talk to the commander. Whether these men represent private or national interests is not specified and it doesn't matter. The point being made is that money will always be prioritized over the cause, whatever that cause may be. Selfish greed will always come before national pride.The boy soldiers decide that they have had enough and are abandoning their commandant. Guns are drawn, threats are made and insults are thrown. Surely, we are about to witness more bloodshed. Or perhaps the commandant, the clear villain of the film will get his comeuppance in the form of an execution. Afterall what a fantastic irony it would be for him to die by the hand of his own soldiers. But instead, they abandon him. For a man like him, this is a fate worse than death. With no soldiers to command, no sons to abuse and no boys to hide behind, what is he? He is just like them. Just another boy who never got his piece of the pie.Beasts of No Nation could succeed on being a raw depiction of tragedy alone. In other words, there is merit enough in simply showing you what happens. Instead, it achieves a lot more. It not only shows you why it happens. It shows you why it doesn't last."
" Powerful!
",0.4753,-0.8834,2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,All gen Z must watch this movie before going and making another tik tok on how gen z doesn't feel anything because they were born on collapse of twin towers/their childhood was structured around the market crash 2008 and how tragedy has followed them their whole life.
" One of the best child actors I've seen, and an amazingly told story
",0.6369,-0.3591,2021-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Beasts of No Nation does an amazing job of showing the horrors of modern bush warfare and the awful conditions of child soldiers. Abraham Attah is fantastic in his role, outshining just about every other child actor. None of the performances noticeably drag with any other character, and all the characters feel like they fit well into the story. Agu's development from an innocent child to someone hardened by the horror of war and his training to be a killer is portrayed excellently.The African landscapes shown are breathtaking at times, yet bleak and barren when the scene demands it. The score feels fitting in every moment, though no particular track is very memorable. The story is gripping and mixes both action and emotion very well. None of the violent scenes are glorified and the effects of the violence is often shown is a shocked or saddened light after the adrenaline of the scene dies down. You end up feeling conflicted as you watch, wandering who you're meant to be rooting for as even the young child soldiers commit atrocities at the guidance of older mercenaries.I think this is a must-watch for people who enjoy exploring war in the modern day and enjoy moral conflict. It's run time makes it more suited to a dedicated sit-down rather than a casual nighttime Netflix browsing."
" A MUST WATCH NO MATTER WHAT YOU LIKE
",0.1027,-0.3612,2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"It was a visually engaging and emotionally captivating experience. The depth in character development, the unapologetic narration and the reflective direction laid the grounds of this unique war film. The performances from the actors elevated it from simply fitting into the war-film genre. Do give it a watch."
" Raw and unapologetic
",0.0,-0.9648,2021-02-04 00:00:00,10,"This's one of the best war movies I've seen. It shows what war does and how it affects us all. It's even worse when kids are on the frontline. After seeing most of his family killed, a young boy (Abraham Attah) finds himself in a gang of guerrillas fighting against their government.Leading the rouges is the charismatic yet manipulative Commander (Idris Elba). The longer he stays and fights with them, the more he's exposed to the harsh realities of war. Slowly and slowly, he loses his innocence and hope. In one scene, he's raped by the Commander after being called to his room.The film is brutal in its depiction of child soldiers and war in general. Naturally, it can be off putting but that's what make it compelling. Seeing these kids/teens go from regular youths to killing machine is unnerving. At one point, the main lead's convinced to kill a civilian by being led to think he's a collaborator.The film can be tough to sit through sometimes but the acting is what keeps it going. Everyone's believable. It's also cool to hear the various languages spoken in some parts of the movie. Beast of No Nation is an interestingly gripping film. One that I highly recommend."
" A rare spectacle from a rare director
",0.0,-0.315,2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"This film blew me away in every concept of filmmaking, from the cinematography to the musical score to the acting and production design. There have been so many films made on the horrifying and sad subjects that come out of 3rd world countries. Very rarely is one depicted so beautifully and horrifying as this. Cary Fukunaga is one of those rare writer/directors in Hollywood whose visions come to life in visually searing ways. The way this film starts gives NO hint to the horror to come, in fact its a humble, modest and humorous opening to a family life trying to survive in a war torn country. But nothing lasts forever. Although very hard to watch at times, its a great film all around."

",0.5994,-0.5584,2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"This is a hardcore war film. It does no play around. It's very rough and harsh. It shows many sinister war crimes. It is filled with tons of violence, force and power hunger. On the other hand its cinematography is just stunning. This film shows a lot of beautiful nature and wildlife. The colour palette is very colourful and pretty to look at. This film is very arty too. There's some philosophy and many monologues. I highly recommend it if you like serious film."
" Good movie but it kind of pisses me off
",-0.3797,-0.9624,2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,"Its based on a true story.Its a straight to the point movie. Its about war, poverty and children soldiers.Blue eyed people invade behind the scenes. They give them all the guns and cause war for afros to kill afros. The blue eyed people play on both sides. Foolish afros don't realize until its all over.Verdict: Why are people so stupid and greedy?"
" Simply great
",0.6249,-0.9266,2020-10-23 00:00:00,10,"Great movie! Realistic depiction of the hard realities in Africa... The horrors and cruelty are inimaginable. But the sad reality is it's all ""home made"" by the greedy local chieftains and warlords that are struggling for power and money at any cost."
" Film Review - Beasts of No Nation (2015) 7.9/10
",-0.296,-0.9699,2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,"""Visually, Fukunaga doesn't let onslaught of violence to desensitize the wartime cruelty, one single exception of explicitness is the initiation when Agu is foisted to hack a captive to death, a close-up shows the machete smack stuck in the victim's head. Elsewhere, the killings are circumspectly made off scene. Almost imperceptibly orchestrated long takes are Fukunaga's trademark in the action, here, twinned with an alien, bosky landform (mostly shot in Ghana), or an instance of infrared transmutation, BEASTS OF NO NATION, teeming with éclat and stealthy celerity, conduces to a rip-roaring viewing of first-grade spectacle-making."""
" A perfect war drama.
",-0.0516,0.8316,2020-09-29 00:00:00,9,Everything about this movie is perfect. Agu has done such a great job along Idris Alba. I'm writing this review only it to be not posted.
" Eyes of a Child soldier
",0.0,-0.9503,2020-07-13 00:00:00,8,"Beast of no nation depicts a west African nation engulfed in a brutal civil war. The movie takes us on a journey of Agu, a young boy living with is family in a war torn province. Circumstances leads to anarchy and the boy falls into the hands of a local war lord played by Idris Alba to perfection.
After recruitment, training and certain rituals the boy graduates to operations. In the field of operations Agu grows from strength to strength in every passing battle. Fate takes a different turn when Agu's commander disagrees with his boss, who has other ulterior motives in nation building and as a result Agu's unit commander goes ""rouge"" only to start a downward spiral of the unit's fortune.
After much hardships faced, the unit disbands and abandons their commander. The unit ultimately surrenders to the UN forces. Agu then lives in a reformation camp and tries to reform himself but suffers from the horrors of war.Full credit to the crew who have made such a wonderful film. Direction was top class and the war sequences were shot brilliantly shows the quality of production design. The core of the story is about the horrors of war than war itself, in which the writers of the movie have excelled. This is a movie which is not to be missed on any cost. A must watch to understand the Psychosis of a child soldier."
" Good Plot , bad dialogue
",-0.1531,0.9523,2020-07-06 00:00:00,7,"The plot and storyline is really interesting and scenery is great. The dialogue though is just disappointing , Idris Elbas ""west african"" accent is really bad and unnatural, he goes from pidgin to his normal british accent and the saying ""eh"" a lot is just ....... tiring . Great acting and story line but a better more indigenous actor would have played his role better making the dialogue sound more natural and real"
" Disturbingly good
",-0.1027,0.9209,2020-04-24 00:00:00,9,"I've only come to watch this movie now, five years after it's release. I am a big fan of (Anti)War movies and I don't take them too hard on the emotional side normally.But this one is different. The cruel side of war through the eyes of a child is shown raw and brutal as it is. He gets his mother taken from him and his dad, brother and later on best friend shot in front of his eyes. There is not much context given on the greater picture about the war. But no one should actually care because it is about what war does to the people.The outrageous performance of Abraham Attah is crucial for the films effect. He displays Agu's strength and change in character better than anyone else could have. You might as well believe he actually lived through all of this. Idris Elba and all of the other actors do a fine job as well.Overall a great movie with some slight lengths, but if you're focused on it, you'll enjoy it but at the same time it probably will make you want to cry."
" Sad that this movie went so under the radar
",-0.4767,-0.5907,2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,"I don't know much about war and even less about the guerrilla warfare, but this movie is in my opinion trying to show what is happening and how cruelsome war and especially for kid soldiers is. How it ruins childhood.
It doesn't hide awful things but also doesn't push you into some gore.I'm more than glad that i watched that movie"
" Greatest Film Ever!
",0.6696,-0.9852,2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"This film is an eye-opening experience through the depths of hopelessness and child soldier enlistment. We watch through Agu's eyes as the world he once knew is torn apart by an apocalyptic-like war. The Commandant is one of the most memorable villains of all time. Agu's journey is unbearable, unbelievable, and even disturbing. In this war there are no winners. Those who are free from pain, suffering, and guilt are troubled survivors. In war, the demons come for everyone."
" Best Netflix movie I have seen so far!
",0.6696,0.8716,2020-01-17 00:00:00,9,Highly impressed by the acting in this movie. Idris should definitely get an award for his acting same as the kids in this movie. Movie grabs you by the throat! Can't believe it I haven't read more of this movie in the media before
" Enjoyed this one
",0.5106,0.9681,2019-10-25 00:00:00,7,Found it on Netflix. I've always liked Idris Elba. The director responsible for 'True Detective' which was great so I had high hopes. I wasn't let down either. It was worth the watch for sure. For me with an ever growing list of 'watch later' I'm glad I didn't add this one and watched it.
" Amazing & Real
",0.5859,0.9489,2019-10-06 00:00:00,7,First of all this film is truly amazing! I felt what those kids been through there! The kid who acted as agu really did a great job! Everythin of this film is beautifu! A must watch for all movie lovers
" As close as it can get
",0.0,0.6677,2019-09-01 00:00:00,9,"At any point in time one or more African countries are experiencing civil wars. This is a generic story of a innocent but enthusiastic young boy turning into a rebel, fighting against the government of his country.
The phases of personality changes are beautifully picturised.
Idris alba is no less than brilliant.
For Agu, there couldn't be a better choice."
" If you really want to know what it feels like

" Oscar material..
",0.0,0.0,2019-08-01 00:00:00,10,How this film did not get an Oscar is beyond me. This is how films should be made.
" Harrowing, honest and impactful
",0.5106,0.9717,2019-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Beasts of No Nation is by no means an easy, satisfying watch but it's an impactful movie that reflects the current social political climate. While some of the visual content featured here is absolutely harrowing, it does feel very humantized and the cinematography and score is stunning and euphoric. The score manages to blend African percussion with lush synthesised soundbeds which felt fresh and unique. BONN also doesn't try to fit within genre conventions and felt very genuine despite the hard hitting situations characters are placed in to. This is especially reflective in the acting from the young male lead 'Abu' who excels in emotion and desperation. It felt familiar to Blood Diamond in a sense but arguably more subtle and stripped back.Idris Elba also does a great job within the film to create a character unique to his acting tool set.My main issue with the movie is that some details are left short and I wanted to know more and have this expanded upon - especially considering this title is standalone and not likely to receive a sequel.It likely won't satisfy casual viewers but those invested in the premise will experience a powerful film."
" Striking!!!
",0.0,0.7574,2019-06-25 00:00:00,8,"This film can be supposed as a audio-visual masterpiece! I loved perspectives, proper dosage of music, visual narration; aesthetic wide views and close-up scenes.
The reason of rating 8 is related to some problematical aspects of film's hypothesis. However, this is directly based on my subjective opinions and much relative.
Absolutely, must be seen 👍🏻👍🏻"
" Fantastic..

" Frightening but Astonishing
",-0.2732,0.9596,2019-05-31 00:00:00,8,"Frightening but astonishing. The pace of the film was nicely designed. The actings and set designs are so well done that for so many moments, I started to question if whether this is real or not. The story is nicely developed that it is not too fast or too slow. The pace of plotting the story allows the film to nicely give each character enough background stories for audience to feel fully immersed. This film was recommended to me after watching ""Liyana"" with friend. In contrast of ""Liyana"", ""Beasts of Nation"" showed a different perspective and eye into a similar situation and living environment. ""Liyana"" used a more gentle and settle way whereas ""Beasts of No Nation"" brutally displays the crucial real. Thank you filmmakers for making the decision of not trying to be nice toward audiences and viewers. This is what made this film frightening but astonishing and unforgettable."
" A brutal and sad depiction of war and it's devastating effects.
",-0.9468,0.1863,2019-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Beasts of No Nation is my favourite movie at the moment. The movie contains many mature themes revolving around child soldiers and the terrible things they must endure. It gives a realistic depiction of these tragedies and most likely will have changed your outlook on the world by the end of the film. Beasts of no Nation has some of the best child acting I've ever seen in a movie. This movie is very slow paced with intense scenes every now and then to keep it interesting for the casual viewer. If you don't like movies that are long and not action filled this Is probably not the movie for you. But if you are looking for an emotional, realistic, disturbing, in-depth and intense movie, I highly recommend."
" Great but nothing i Will watch again
",0.3716,-0.9842,2019-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Definetly a movie that numbs you. It has almost the same drozy headache inducing feeling like apokalypse now. And its about children wich makes it worse. And well..harder to appriciate the movie. It's unreal that kids gets brainwached and become little killing machines and its also unreal that Africa in this modern day can't stop the terrors that often happens there. It's one of the Biggest continents but still. It's the same problems there always been. starvation, deseases, wars, rebel gerillas, poatchers, genocide, never had a proper governance in their life. This is how african movies always have been portraid. Every news Iv'e ever read etc. Destroying the rainforest, killing gorillas, all the innocents that dies. It's never a pleasant view and it doesnt need to be. I'm lucky i was born in europe. Thats like everything im thinking.
Just tired of watching this type of movies. It's like Reading bad news every day you get depressed and feel bad.
Beasts of no nation is a very well-made film.
Great acting and war effects. It's a doom ride for sure.
But is it an good movie? I just don't know..
It's like.. city of god 2?
Same stuff different cloak"
" Fukunaga did it again!
",0.0,0.471,2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"A great Idris Elba and a wonderfull performance of the main character(Abraham Attah) makes this movie one of the best netflix originals.
Directed and written by Fukunaga, this movie takes you on a ride through the pain politics and war can do to people. It makes you think about the world and it gives you a reality dosis of what goes on every day and nobody speaks enough of.
It's slow paced, which pays of,because it drags you into the emotions the main character feels, and gives you at times a sticky feeling who doen't disappears until the movie is over. On the other hand, the movie feels maybe 15 minutes too long but if you have time ,it's a must."

" A great narration as well as a wholly convincing tragic
",0.7096,0.9313,2019-02-13 00:00:00,10,An overwhelming film anchored by an impressive debut from Abraham Attah as Agu. Idris Elba is a force as Commandant.

" An Important Message Of A Movie.
",0.2023,0.9974,2018-12-21 00:00:00,7,"A most stark, grim but enlightening feature. Incredibly told through talented direction and performances.This film has many strengths and is incredible heavy in many aspects. This films greatest asset is its masterful performances, must notably of course from Abraham Attah as Agu and Idris Elba as the Commondant. The juxtaposition between Agu'a innocence and Idris Elba's corrupting cruelty onto Agu and the other child soilders.This film shines a spotlight onto a topic which is highly forgotten and overlooked by most world media. And this film hits hard into the commonality of all humankind, this film focuses on a child in the most desperate of situations, it evokes emotions of mother love, fatherhood, innocence and bemusement of a child learning the world. The film portrays these most fundamental themes to a superb level, and the message it portrays is so splendidly put to screen in a highly candid and realistic feeling and evokes great emotion from any viewer.The screenplay and directorial class of this film are the fundamental seeds from which this feature stems. Unlike many Netflix features which seem to blur in monostyalistic tones and cinematography, this film has a distinct voice that I haven't seen from any other Netflix film, the fact that the director and screenplay differentiate themselves so much is a great achievement in and of itself, and displays the very unique voice this film portrays.The performance of Abraham Atta as Agu is one of the best child performances I have ever seen, perhaps even the best. His portra displays the childhood innocence to tormented and tortured soilderhood which such prowess and emotion. Even only 30 minutes into the feature I was rooting heavily for him and the heartbreak of being separated from his mother. His performance never lets down or weakens, and is just as strong in both languages he uses.Idris Elba as the 'Commondant' is also rather a unique performance. He is a highly intimidating figure who seems like a classic 'strong man' at first but becomes highly layered, he has fears for his position and yet acts like a 'father' to his men and yet still abuses them both mentally and physically in the most abhorrent ways. This is the kind of character who is present in mangy features but here is not clichèd, one feels true fear of him.The cinematography as I had already stated is very distinct from most other Netflix motion pictures. It is extremely vibrant and deeply layered, the jungles feel dense and the towns compact yet there is so much sunlight and the colours are rich. This film doesn't feel bland at all, however some of the camera work is fairly standard in places. In parts it is truly magnificent, such as when Agu runs away from his town into the jungle or near the end in the trenches. But some parts feel fairly standard in particular towards the third act of the story.This film has a very unique voice. And is a great achievement in raising awareness for a part of the world that is most overlooked and humanising those who suffer. The film deliberately does not give a specific name to where it takes place to not have the burden of pre-conceived opinions on what we think of Africa and is conflicts, this is a great strength into developing emotion within the narriative.Although I must say that in parts the film it feels over stretched, and a little too long to where the focus is lost in places but still holds emotional weight. And of course some of the cinematography is fairly standard, along with a slew of secondary characters who have little effect on the narritiave and serve only to develop the main character but are weakened themsevelves.Overall I give this film a 7/10, as I was not fully ready to brace the depth and emotion of the film, and the incredible weight it delivered, but this is not a flaw of the film. Some of the previously stated parts do weight against the film, it overstays it's welcome just a little too much. But overall is a must see for anyone interested and does a great service in humanising and raising awareness against the evil that takes place in our world as is often forgotten."
" Superb drama - powerful, profound and poignant
",0.7845,-0.8809,2018-11-01 00:00:00,9,"Agu is a young boy in a war-torn African country. The war eventually reaches his town, resulting in his mother and younger siblings fleeing for the capital and his father and older brother being killed by government forces. Agu flees into the jungle where he meets a battalion of rebel soldiers, lead by their charismatic commander, known simply as Commandant. Agu joins the rebels, not realising the things he will see and be required to do.Superb drama, written and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (of True Detective fame) and produced by Netflix. Chillingly gritty and realistic, showing how easily an innocent boy can become a veteran soldier and merciless killer. Agu's transformation from bystander to combatant and the changes it causes in him is quite amazing to behold, as it is so gradual yet inevitable.Good story, showing well the anarchy of war, and that there's often no good guys, just adversaries. Also shows the effect of war on its participants. The last few scenes show that even once the war stops, some are mentally still fighting. Emotional ending.Idris Alba is the only known actor in the cast and puts in a solid performance as Commandant. However, Abraham Attah, only 13 or 14 at the time, steals the show as Agu. He is excellent in the role.Solid supporting performances.The best movie Netflix has made, to date."
" Beasts of No Nation
",-0.296,-0.9353,2018-10-10 00:00:00,9,"""Grass cutter, ""Grass cutter, left, left! They yelled to Agu as he tried to lift a box full of death weapons with his small frail eleven year old arms. A few days ago I watched a movie that was a remake of the book ""Beasts of No Nation."" Usually when people try to remake a book into a movie, it doesn't turn out well but the drectors managed to form a script that could be understood by everyone but didn't lose its African ethnicity. It was a job well done. The movie follows young boy, Agu, who has gone through a huge tragedy and witnessed the massacre of many he loves due to a war. Trying to survive, alone, helpless, and extremely hungry, he is captured and recruited as a child soldier. A painfully beautiful story"
" A must-see Netflix Original
",0.3182,0.258,2018-08-26 00:00:00,9,"Beasts of No Nation is an essential film to see: the first Netflix Original ever produced is also a very good film about modern african warfare, and the ultimate film about children soldiers. Beasts is a very hard pill to swallow. It isn't particularly gory (The Last King of Scotland, for example, is way harder to watch in terms of gore), but much of the violence that can be seen is utterly crude, especially because it is often performed by brainwashed children. It is definitely a very hard R, mainly due to its theme.Nonetheless, Beast doesn't focus much on battle scenes. There are a few, but not very long or massive, mostly guerrilla-style battles. The focus is on the development of the main character, Agu, rather than on action scenes of sort. I assume the role of Agu wasn't a particularly hard one, but the child-actor playing the character gave him much gravitas, especially in some of the final scenes. Idris Elba also performed with intensity as the Comandant of the Battalion. I loved Season one of True Detective, and Fukunaga again orchestrated wonderfully quite a set of single-take scenes here aswell (though not as long as the famous one from the tv show). Photography sometimes brought eccellent imagery to look at.While the final 15 minutes or so didn't completely feel conclusive, I would say that, as of the date of this review (August 2018), Beasts is perhaps the best Netflix Original film so far released. The only other film that might compete for the title is Hell or High Water. Following this first release, there have been very few outstanding Netflix films (to list some good ones: Hell or High Water, Mudbound, Annihilation, The Meyerowitz Stories) and tons of very bad releases (Spectral, Death Note, Mute, The Cloverfield Paradox and so on). Let's hope that the 2018 fall season brings many such good Netflix Original films as Beasts of no Nation."
" It will leave you shaken and stirred
",-0.128,-0.6798,2018-08-14 00:00:00,9,"I do not think that there is anything new to add to the reviews that are already here. This film is brutally honest and so it is not an easy watch. Lets say it is not ""Imagination TV"" it is as real as the war in some parts of Africa is. The depiction is so true to real life that you will either dislike the film from the very beginning or you will be glued to the story of Agu. Like many who have seen this film, I too am surprised that the Oscars snubbed this gem of a film."
" As a US Veteran, I was quite mind blown
",0.0,-0.9935,2018-05-31 00:00:00,10,"The film does a good job depicting the brutal process of African youth being converted into child soldiers, not only in this un-named West African nation, but probably throughout all of Africa. The film does not shy away from depicting the sickening barbarism of war, and the aimless cycles of revenge that keeps it going. Viewers should be warned when watching this film. What blew my mind the most about this film was the speech made by the African warlord toward the end of the film as his soldiers are abandoning him. I have *absolutely no sympathies* for this character, but I feel his speech hit it on the head not only for veterans of this historical fiction conflict, but for US Veterans as well (minus the war crimes). In my opinion, I feel that the US has some of the absolute poorest attitudes towards its veterans when compared with many nations in the world. What you see in the US is absolute insincere, shallow, fakery in terms of its public 'support' for veterans (my opinion). Also, the speech made the by main character, a child soldier, during his therapy after he surrendered, could not have said it ANY better for US Veterans....COMPLETELY different circumstances between the wars of US Veterans and the rebels depicted in this movie, yet the final realities for both veteran groups are depicted in similar and disturbingly accurate ways.

" Heartbreaking and terrifying.
",-0.7717,-0.9037,2018-05-18 00:00:00,7,"A film about political and civil unrest in Africa (the specific country is never named) and as heartbreaking and terrifying as you'd imagine. Wonderfully made, the camera work puts you right in the centre alongside these people having their already tough worlds torn apart. It's not easy to watch, the depiction of callous disregard for life, especially seen through the eyes of a child is often too much to bare. As if that's not harrowing enough, what follows is beyond horrific. Incessant killing, exploitation of children, power hungry people with complete disregard for life and any moral standard. In all the confusion it's not always obvious who the real monsters are. As the film goes on though, is seems everyone is and as things escalate, it's hard to except that despite this being dramatised, it's no doubt based on a sad harsh reality. Elba is frighteningly good, so much so, you wonder if you were able to reach into that world, would you kill him and become a monster too. Abraham Attah, who plays Agu, the child who leads us through this brutal world is amazing. This is his first outing and it's quite incredible, I've no doubt he'll go on to even greater things (although he's signed up for a Spider-Man film). The music is the only true positive element of the film itself, be it the traditional stuff or the ethereal score, it's outstanding, but never masks the turmoil of the characters and their existence."
" Raw and Powerful
",0.4215,0.5083,2018-05-06 00:00:00,8,One of the better war movies i saw lately. Really cool cinematography that enhances the beauty of Africa thats being taken for granted. It does a really good job immersing you into the war and make you care about the characters.Its about a kid who loses his family to war then is forced to join the mercenaries. We watch his transformation from an innocent child into a soldier as he questions his own actions and trying to survive.
" Should Have Been Foreign Language
",0.0,-0.8016,2018-04-28 00:00:00,7,"I lived in Sierra Leone. To me, the story borrowed from the Charles Taylor catastrophe that wracked that beautiful country. I feel that the director took the pidgin English too far. The longer the movie went on the more irritated I became. I'm sorry to say that by the time it was finished I was of the opinion it was a racist hatchet job by a Western director. It even had me questioning why Idris Elba put his name to this.On the bright side, the acting performances were good to excellent. The cinematography was often top class too. Just a shame that the movie was undermined by stupid decision to overuse pidgin English."
" It was the worst of times. It was the worst of times.
",-0.8481,-0.9689,2018-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Agu (Abraham Attah) is a young lad growing up in impoverished western Africa. He lives a somewhat idyllic life under the circumstances. The film builds his family life in the background involving a war zone between the army and rebels. Through a series of circumstances, the army kills his kinsmen and Agu manages to escape and reluctantly joins forces with the rebels and vows revenge. Agu has some first person narrative. He struggles with cultic aspects of the rebel army and battalion leader. He discovers they have no respect for life, but he has no alternative and curses the sun for shining on him. He realizes with death all around him, he has been robbed of his childhood, perhaps with thoughts and language well beyond his years. This is not a story of hope or despair. It is a drama about life, a life that doesn't have a Hollywood ending or twist. Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. English subtitles in places. I would recommend watching the film with the subtitles as the English is difficult to understand at times."
" That was just awful
",-0.4588,-0.9552,2018-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I just finished watching the film and that was probably one of the most basic and mediocre story line plots I've ever seen in a film. You can literally sum up the whole 2 hour film in 20 seconds: Agu's Family are killed by the government troops, the rebels take Agu in, Agu feels uncomfortable with being a part of the rebels, Agu feels like he is part of rebels, Agu soon realizes killing people is wrong, Agu is rescued and put into a care home. The End.Everyone just pretends that they really enjoyed this film because it is based on true events and is ""meaningful"". That film wasn't meaningful one bit, it didn't show the truth of what child soldiers. And why does everyone praise Idris Elba so much for his performance? There's a ton of people out there who can put on an African accent, pick up a gun and look intimidating. Really people Idris Elba's performance is nothing to get crazy about.And let's not forget the fact that this film was a box office failure making only $90,000. Seriously, how can a film receiving this much praise make less than $100,000? Even some of the worst reviewed films out there such as The Emoji Movie have made more money than Beasts Of No Nation.Beasts Of No Nation will never be any better than any other film based on civil war in Africa such as Blood Diamond and Hotel Rwanda with well thoughtout out plots."
" 8.5
",0.0,0.9607,2017-12-18 00:00:00,8,"Good piece of storytelling, good cinematography, good character development, overall solid movie. One of my gripes about this movie involved Abu not finding his mother at the end, although the end contains something of equal importance, Abu's ability to be free despite living a traumatic life."
" Best War African War Movie Ever!
",-0.5983,0.8477,2017-12-13 00:00:00,10,"The entire cast of Beast of no Nation was perfect! This movie was compelling with beautiful shots and music. The settling was shot somewhere in Africa, but it did not specify in the movie. The reason behind that was to have this movie be applied to all the African countries. I really appreciated this movie because my mom experienced 7 years of civil wars back in Liberia. Beast of No Nation is quite the untold story about such a huge political and inhumane problem within the African nation. Beast of no Nation painted vivid shots of what life was like for these child soldiers, so it can be a little hard to watch. I consider this movie to be an eye opener to African's culture. This was much more than entertainment, but more of a virtual experience. I would recommend this movie to anyone to watch."
" An endless cycle of violence
",-0.6249,-0.9944,2017-10-27 00:00:00,8,"I've always wondered what it is about Africa that makes it the most unstable continent on Earth. So much poverty, so much fighting. Beasts of no Nation shows why, through the eyes of a child soldier. It starts charmingly, with poor but happy children acting their age. But fast enough, Agu's world is torn apart as his family is killed or escapes to be never seen again. He is then manipulated to be a child soldier to, as he sees it, revenge those who killed his family. And at first, it looks like these are the good guys. But what this film is great at showing is that there are NO good guys. The first scene that causes us to question how different Agu's group really are is a scene in which Agu is persuaded to execute a captured enemy soldier. His acting is phenomenal here and you can tell that he will never be a child again. Then another shocker comes when the NPD, the rebel group Agu is fighting for, mercilessly and indiscriminately kills innocent villagers just like Agu's relatives. In a powerful moment he realises a woman they want to rape could easily be his mother. Yet these are all slaughtered for the crime of being at the wrong place. What makes this film even more heartbreaking is how beautiful the scenery is. The cinematography really captures this. How could something so evil happen somewhere do beautiful? The only gripe I have is with the ending. It's optimistic, which makes you feel hopeful for Agu but that doesn't mean it was the right way to go. In a more realistic scenario he would have ended up becoming a soldier like all the others, brutally murdering and raping villagers. There could have been a flash forward to an adult Agu doing this. Instead the makers chose the safer way out and had Agu rescued by the UN.Beasts of no Nation is a must-see. It makes you understand the never-ending cycle of violence happening in Africa in a distressing way, through the eyes of someone who has seen things he should never have seen and done things no child his age should ever have had to do."
" A brilliant, urgent and overlooked film
",0.6705,-0.9705,2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"I watched this on Netflix (where it exclusively available). It's the story of a child soldier fighting a civil war in an unnamed African country (filmed in Ghana). It's terrific. It features two wonderful performances. One from Idris Elba, as the commander of the boy soldiers, transforming them from children to killers; he's terrifyingly charismatic, and really makes you believe the relationship between him and his chargers. The second is from Abraham Attah as the boy at the heart of it all, taking us on a mesmeric and heartbreaking journey. Horrifying as it is, we are spared many of the real horrors of war whilst still letting us feel the impact of the atrocities on both victims and perpetrators. The cinematography brings the colours of the bush to life, the dust almost seeping under your fingernails as you watch; the music is beautiful and, along with the almost at times poetic script, this both offsets and points up the horror of events portrayed. It's a brilliant and urgent film, without a white saviour in sight, which Netflix (who put up the money for the production when it was threatened with going under) are to be commended for taking a risk on it. The reasons for it being overlooked in awards is obvious and twofold - endemic racism in the film industry and fear of the future as a streaming service trumps the film's very limited cinema release. If you have Netflix, search it out; if you don't, it's one of many good reasons to fork out for a subscription."
" Good film, but needed something more.
",0.2382,-0.9597,2017-10-04 00:00:00,6,"I was wavering on rating this film 6 or 7. It had the potential to be a 9 or 10, and based on all the hype and netflix trailers, I hoped that it would be.There are plenty of brutal and heart-wrenching moments, and Idris Elba is a talented actor that I enjoyed as the warlord molding the kid army. However, I feel that there is some confusion and missing holes in this film, that somehow leave it disjointed. It seems to slow down half- way through, and missed out on designing a more powerful narrative and explanation for many of the things going on. In the end, it comes across as an overly-long war film, that just portrays the same things that many already know or believe about African war zones. I thought Blood Diamond did more to explain situations and build characters, while giving a greater understanding of the situation. There are some good character developments, as the boy becomes desensitized to violence and insanity around him, and some entertaining and intense moments, but it just doesn't match the exquisite film-making of other films on such subjects, or war films in general.I felt lost and kind of bored throughout the last half of the film, and found myself distracted and eating snacks, about to doze off for an afternoon nap. It needs something more!!!"
" A must watch movie
",0.0,0.8686,2017-09-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is EPIC. I cannot stop watching it. The mixed feelings, pain, hurt, perfect reflection of our society how did we get here?. Humans need to learn how to love one another truly. Idris is such an amazing actor the way he fits into character is indescribable...i cannot believe he didn't get an academy for this."
" A typical war drama
",-0.5994,-0.9868,2017-09-16 00:00:00,7,"War drama used to exploits character to its core. By giving hard story imposed to its protagonist, the audience obliged to relates themselves by constant reminder that life is nothing but series of tragedy. Unfortunately, Beasts of no Nations are no different. Except that it offer darker tone than, -for example, City of God that also issued similar problem about child of war. Beasts of No Nations take a close look of child soldier in Africa that separated from their family in the midst of regional conflict. These child fueled by hatred, are easy pick to be trained into sudden soldier in field. They are ready to be shaped and not well adjusted to cope with trauma. This preference are proved by the scene where Commandant ordered Agu to kill a grown educated man, because he knows that the man no longer able to be manipulated and the best use of the man is only as living prove to maintain his total power.What its offer that has not yet I saw in another war drama, is the detail of soldier's inauguration, or particular rites of passage. The early shouts that made Agu stand still, yelling out his loyalty while at the same time retained his existence, are well illustrated. The rest of rites are apparent sacred, with many hint of fascism. Still, due to its based on novel from the same title, it bears portion of qualm that cannot be taken at face value. His development from child to a beast is remarkably started, not after his rites completion, but the first premature kill that defined his actual changes and shifting his moral ground. Agu's inner voice while he talk to himself by using God as instrument, is our checkpoint each time he deprived from child nature. We could see from the beginning that Agu's family is a typically moderate in term of religion which mark them as ideal family to begin with. They understand problem that lies around and acts accordingly, while still cares for others without doubt. They hold high regards of others, which placed them with better moral position from the rest. Such innocent family that deserve no place at this war. While this serves as prior motive for us to take more sentiment from the protagonist, this family-based narrative device are easily found everywhere else. The mother issue aren't resolved. It is compelling to say that the director tried to send us back to final tragedy that Agu had lost all hope of return to his old life. Yet, the final act that Agu started to make peace with himself are pretty straightforward and well closing the movie in proper manner, like the rest of its structure. Good, but not extraordinary."
" This is a story of loss and rebirth (SPOILERS)
",-0.3182,-0.7061,2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"The movie starts out following a typical middle-class family living in a small village in what appears to be West Africa. The movie then expands the context and shows us that the town is in the middle of a battle between the corrupt and violent United Nations backed government forces and the ragged pack of rebel fighters. As the peaceful townspeople decide to ship away women and children to allow the men to stay back and fight, there is no room for some of the younger boys, so they are also to stay behind. Agu, the film's protagonist, ends up witnessing the United Nations backed government forces senselessly execute all of his family members that remained in the village. Fortunately, Agu is able to flee these mentally disturbed, deranged, blood-thirsty, war mongering United Nations backed government forces as he runs deep into the bush.Now orphaned, Agu is on his own in the wild. It appears that he will have no chance of survival, as he can not even light himself a fire and is not sure of what he can eat. Fortunately, the story's hero, known as the ""Commandant"" (played by Idris Elba), has managed to save many other UN backed government created orphans. Commandant's crew of orphaned boys stumbles upon helpless little Agu. Much of the movie is related to how Commandant takes little Agu under his wing, teaches him survival, feeds him, clothes him, and allows him to exact his revenge on the evil UN backed government forces. Commandant is shown to be leading a pack of what appears to be 20 to 30 other boys and young adults, all presumably orphaned similarly to Agu and all with a thirst for revenge on those that murdered their families. Throughout the film, Commandant is first shown as a heroic warrior, then a wise leader, and then devolves into an ordinary human being. Although he is a true leader, he also answers to an authority. When he finds out that his authority cares more about political aspirations than providing justice, he tries to oust Commandant from his post. Commandant then goes rogue and takes his orphaned boy tribe with him. It is somewhat similar to Colonel Kurtz's situation in ""Apocalypse Now"", with the exception that Commandant does not really have a clue on how to lead a group of rogue dissidents.Ultimately, his orphans desert him due to lack of food, water, and hope. Commandant's demise can be attributed to the corrupt nature of war and the western world's political influences. Deep down, he was shown to be a genuinely good man, fighting for justice, all while being a protector and guardian of many orphaned children.Many will see this movie from a different perspective. One of the themes of the movie, which is something that plays out every day in real life, is that the subtle authoritarian rule of western governments is both the cause and solution to many of life's problems. First, they were directly responsible for the bloody and senseless murder of the families of many of these children. Secondly, as we see toward the end of the movie, these children are placed in a government-run school to learn and survive. Government creates the problems and then attempts to fix them. However, they did achieve their main goal. The villages they needed to eradicate are now gone, with all remaining residents under the guardianship of the state.This movie is a great example of how innocent lives are taken, families are destroyed, and entire communities are eliminated due to the military involvement of western societies. There is no doubt that this story is being played out for real in the Middle East and all over Africa due to both the United States' and many European countries' perpetual foreign intervention campaigns."

A young boy, Agu played by Abraham Attah is escaping with his brother. When his brother is shot, and killed by the military. After running through the jungle, Agu, a good native boy, encounters Commandant, played by Idris Elba, a NDF or Native Defense Force who takes Agu under his wing to be a soldier in his militia. Agu is joined by another native boy, Strika played by Emmanuel Nii Adom Quaye. And after a rough initiation, both boys join the militia. Commandant, not such a great guy, calls for Agu to go to his quarters, where he rapes Agu. Preacher, played by Teibu Owusu Acheampong, knows of what happened to Agu and gives Agu brown-brown, a mix of cocaine and gunpowder, smeared in a wound to ""lift"" his spirits. Agu and Strika are lead into many bloody ambushes and fights to take over towns by killing the people of villages that they come across. Commandant takes his battalion to the Supreme Commander of the NDF because Commandant thinks he's being promoted but only to find out that he is being demoted to a staff position and his Lieutenant is actually going to be in charge. Commandant decides to take his battalion to brothel to have fun but things go horribly wrong. One of the women shoot the Lieutenant by ""accident"". But Commandant doesn't believe the woman and has a shootout in the brothel, killing all the women and then running. The battalion is now running from their own militia, UN, and the government. They were fighting airstrikes and ambushes, Strika is killed during the ambush. The battalion now taking cover at a gold mine. Leaving them with no ammunition to be able to defend themselves, Preacher who now is the Lieutenant speaks up and says if they don't turn themselves into the UN will starve to death or be killed. Commandant doesn't want to do this but ends up letting them go after Agu speaks up. Shortly after they leave Commandant, they are captured by troops who take the young fighters to a missionary school. Agu not mingling with the other children and having nightmares from his ordeal, is reluctant to talk to his counselor because he is afraid his counselor will think he is a ""beast"" because of all the bad things he has done. Instead he decides to tell the counselor about his life as a good boy and how much his family loved him. After talking to the counselor, he found peace enough to mingle with the other children by going swimming. This film used lighting and music to bring out the strong feelings of this movie. The sound effects make this an action-packed film, that leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat"
" good and accurate
",0.4404,0.9311,2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"This movie does a very good job of showing the brutality of other countries and the way that they treat their children. Throughout the movie very little is held back in the sense of visually demonstrating the harsh conditions. As they follow agu on his journey not much seems unrealistic like in some movies where certain situations are blown up and made bigger than they could ever be in person. This is however not the case in this movie, the directors obviously did their homework and looked into real event similar to the one depicted in the movie. This situation does seem very similar to the ""KONY 2012"" situation that happened years ago. All the smaller details like the initiation of agu and what he was armed with and the conditions he faced when fighting were spot on compared to actual accounts of child soldiers in many third world countries. Overall this movie does a very good job at staying interesting as well as have many historically accurate aspects to it. I would recommend this movie to someone looking for entertainment or someone looking to gain more knowledge about the growing issue with violence and child soldiers in Africa."
" Agu the Child Soldier
",0.0,0.9799,2017-03-20 00:00:00,9,"The Netflix movie, Beast of No Nation, directed by Cary Fukunaga, is about a young West African boy named Agu. The specific setting is unknown, but it is somewhere in Africa. Agu lives in a village that is protected by Nigerian soldiers. Since it is a buffer zone, many things are run down, so there is no schooling. The families inside are suppose to be safe, however the village gets ambushed by rebels. Unfortunately, Agu's father and brother are executed by the rebels. Agu manages to escape into the forest just to be captured by another rebel group. He will later be brainwashed and become a child soldier for the Native Defense Forces, NDF. The director's background includes a couple of movies and a TV show. He is definitely qualified for motion picture production since he has won a Primetime Emmy along with 25 wins and 22 nominations. The budget he had to make this movie was 6 million dollars. This movie's settings were realistic because it was shot in Ghana. SInce there was not many special effects needed for this film, viewers got a great visual for how these West Africans lived and what they went through. Although the places the movie takes place are beautiful, the conditions many of the people lived in are horrible. The village Agu was in at the beginning of the movie was rundown and dirty with lots of garbage around. On the outskirts, refugees would surround the village pleading their way to get in. There was not a lot of money to be made inside the village, so the kids made a buck where they could. For example, Agu took apart the shell of the TV in order to try and sell to someone in the village. Another way Agu and his brother made a few dollars was by purposely blocking the roadway and making people pay to get by. These two examples show how rough it was for kids to be living in this village because there is simply no schooling and money. One of the camps that the commandant and the others started for themselves was extremely unhealthy. One of the promises of the commandant was to give the kids better than what they had. Instead the kids were left digging trenches and cleansing themselves with muddy water. The living condition was not the worst thing for the boys though. It was the fact that they were child soldiers brainwashed to fight and kill who they were told. The movie does a great job with these scenes, especially with the acting from the kids. Agu definitely did a great job persuading the audience that he went through a mental change from the commandant. After the brainwashing, Agu's attitude toward everything changed. He turned into a soldier. One example of is true change was when he killed an innocent man. This shows how he was manipulated into thinking he was doing the right thing, but in reality he was turning into the type of person that killed his father and brother. Since this movie is not strictly based off of a true event, rather based on general true information, it is hard to know what the purpose of the film really is. One way to look at why it was made is how it portrays the brutality children went through during these war times in African places. Also, there really is not any factual or historical errors in this film. This is because there is no answer to base the movie off of. This movie was produced by Netflix, a company famously known in the United States. This can show who the movie movie was made for. It was made for the audience of the United States because that is the audience it is mostly targeting. Overall, the movies overall filmmaking and performance of the actors was top notch. The sequence from the beginning to the end was very clear and fluent. The acting from the commandant was excellent. This is because he plays the strong leader during a war while being able to be somewhat of a ""father figure"" to the kids. For a child, Agu's actor did a great job narrating and acting out the different emotions of his character from when he was with his family to when he was a soldier. In conclusion, this is a great movie to have have open ideas as to what is the true events it is based off of because there is no backstory to it."

",-0.0258,-0.9968,2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"The film ""Beast Of No Nation"", directed by Cary Fukunaga, was set in West Africa and highlighted the popularity of children soldiers in the war. Agu and his family are off to flee to the country's capital, since the government is being run over by rebels, however on their way to escape, their family gets stopped by the rebels and Agu's family gets killed right in front of him. Agu then runs into the bushes and meets up with a rebel faction named NDF and he is trained to be a child soldier. From there, he and his rebel faction murder not only part of the country's military, but go on a killing spree through the country even when the people have done nothing wrong. When the Preacher becomes the new lieutenant, he recommends that all the soldiers surrender to the UN since they will either starve to death or be murdered, however the Commandment refuses to give up. Agu and the other child soldiers join the preacher in giving up and are sent to a missionary school, in which they receive food, shelter, and education.The movie was extremely well produced and really showed the effects of revenge and how the war scene that was taking place in Africa. The acting was phenomenal, especially the young children and how they presented their drainage of themselves after they have become young murderers, so to speak. The camera angles when they are killing the men and women are very impactful, especially in the scene where Agu makes his first kill along with another child soldier with a machete. When the boys are chopping the soldier's head in slow motion and the blood splatters onto the camera lens, it really emphasizes the brutality of the war and how these once innocent children were being introduced into blood thirsty savages. Overall, the film does an amazing job showing the inhumane conditions children and adults have to go through during the war and the effects it has on people in general."
" Beast of No Nation Review
",-0.296,-0.9975,2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"The Netflix original movie, Beast of No Nation, directed by Cary Fukunaga is about a young boy, named Agu, that joins a militia group and gets brainwashed into killing people on his journey. During this film, children are being recruited to be child soldiers and are fighting for this Commandment and this rebel group. They don't really know why they are fighting and who, but they get orders from the capital. The movie starts by Agu and his family living peacefully, but then there is a warning that troops are attacking so the family splits and the father, brother, and grandfather stay. The family is captured and Agu watches as his family is slaughtered. He then joins a rebel group and takes revenge and brainwashed by this group. He does these terrible things and at the end the group surrendered to the UN and Agu lives in this missionary school. This film mostly focuses on revenge and brainwashing children to become these child slaves. The director of this film is Cary Fukunaga and he is an American director from California. Some of his other films and TV shows are True Dectective and Jane Eyre. this movie, Beast of No Nation was picked up by Netflix for a reported 12 million dollars and had an effort to make it into original films. He directed and wrote the script after working on it for 6 years. He then came across the Beast of No Nation novel and was inspired by the Sierra Leone Civil War. he wanted to translate what happened in the book and base the ideas into movie to people that never read it. The film is a historical fiction because it is not set in a real place and just says a western country in Africa. Some people might find that annoying because like the settings and why this is happening. The movie escalated quickly with the family enjoying life and then all a sudden is war torn and the kid family dying. The audience doesn't have time to recuperate what is happening and the movie keeps going. You never get the age of the kid or why there is a fight going on. During the film, the audience get to know that the group is the NDF and are getting orders by the capital. Then, it leaves the audience to guess if Agu joined the same men that killed his family because it never specified who those men that killed his family were. But, past those points the plot was amazing and the actors portrayed those characters well. They had the best of the best actors like Idris Elba, who played in Thor, Star Trek Beyond and The Jungle Book, and Abraham Attah, which was casted in the new Spiderman movie. These people made the audience feel like they were in the moment and felt the intensity. The action in the movie was suspenseful and horrific. The graphic scene with the machete captured the brutality of the moment and what was going on then. The director tried and he succeeded into making this movie as realistic as possible and gave the audience a brutal, but meaningful movie. The movie is not biased in any way because there weren't really a good guy versus bad guy. The audience couldn't really tell and that is what audiences are going to guess about since it it is in a unspecified war and country. The director goes on both sides when it comes to picking a side for the biased. He does capture Agu's side, but also deals with the NDF side and why they are killing. The director does a very good job trying to twist the story a little from the actual event. This movie was inspired by the book he read about the Sierra Leone War. If you look at the history of that there was a civil war and rebel groups just like the film. Also, in the film a lot of people died and in the true event over 50,000 people passed away. So the director does base this movie off that event and some may say that it is from that Civil War, but no one is for sure. It might be a mix of countries due to the geography or even their history of wars. Also, in the film they were mining gold and if you look at the history of the Sierra Leone War they were also mining for minerals and gold. That is why this film is called a historical fiction because of the events and the fictional characters. Therefore, overall this film did an amazing job capturing the events and the brutality Agu had to face and also the acting didn't disappoint. It made the audience feel the intensity of this war and the emotional roller-coaster of the hardships people faced in the country where they lived. I would give this movie a 8 out of 10."
" Good Movie
",0.4404,0.7603,2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"The film Beast of No Nation is a movie about how a civil war in Africa can be very brutal and inhumane. The film follows a young African child whose village was invaded by an unnamed army, and whose dad and brother are killed by this army. He runs away and stumbles into a rebel army that trains him to be a child soldier. The movie follows all of the struggles and horrors that the boy, Agu, goes through, and his mission to get revenge for his father and brother, and get back to his mother and sister. The movie goes through all aspects of being a soldier, like the cruel commandant and the killings that a kid has to do. The movie is very sad and emotional and is a very good movie for learning about what happens in some African countries, and the brutality that happens there. The movie is not based on real events that happened, but it is a fictional story based on real life accounts of the civil wars across Africa. Since it is fictional, the filmmakers took a few artistic liberties with the film. One of these things is the fact that Agu sold a TV to a soldier in the beginning of the film, and he found the same soldier some time later in the film. Also, the commandant disobeyed his orders and left the supreme commander, which caused them to run out of supplies and eventually surrender. This mostly did not happen in reality, and they likely would have stayed together with the rest of the army. This probably happened to advance the plot, and add another internal story line. The theme of family was very prominent in this movie. Agu being separated from his family and trying to get back to his mother, the entire squadron being one big family, and even the brotherhood between Agu and Strika all show how family is very important in the movie. God and Christianity is also very important. Agu is always speaking to God, and the soldiers all pray to God when someone dies. God is a very prominent figure especially to Agu, and he feels bad about all of the sin he commits, and eventually even feels that he can't speak to God because of all the wrongs he has done. Overall, I thought the movie was very interesting and well-made. It keeps the viewer watching and builds so much emotion that it seems impossible that this kind of thing could even be happening somewhere in the world."
" This Film Was Amazing.
",0.5859,0.9073,2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,"Beast of No Nation directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga tells the story of a young African boy named Agu who is living in a village during the time of a civil war. The boy is separated from his mother and sister after they are relocated away from the violence. Agu, his father, and brother are forced to stay behind when the resistance attacks killing both Agu's brother and father. Agu, now alone must find a way to survive alone. He wanders through the woods and is picked up by the resistance and is trained to become a child soldier. On this journey, Agu is faced with unimaginable horrors such as, witnessing people be murdered, getting raped, and getting brainwashing into a killing monster. The film closes with Agu and his platoon surrendering and being placed in a refugee camp for rehabilitation. This film is extremely powerful and leaves quite an impact on the audience. The acting is very well done especially the character of Agu who was played by Abraham Attah, about 13 at time of filming. He's acting skills were superior beyond his years, giving a very dramatic, believable presentation, even including a strong accent. Other acts that played their roles just as well included Idris Elba who played the Commandant as well as Kurt Egyiawan as one of the fellow soldiers. Their strong, believable acting played a big part in making this film as amazing as it was. Cary Joji Fukunaga also did a wonderful job with the creation and filmmaking of this movie as a whole. He, himself has created several other films in the past such as Jane Eyre or Victoria Para Chino, both of which also containing some historical content as well. He also even received the Nigerian Entertainment Award for Best Picture Making and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series among other awards for his work in cinema. With his filmmaking history and numerous award winnings, Fukunaga is very qualified to create this movie. Beast of No Nation was filmed in Africa in Accra, Ghana, aiding in setting the tone and mood of the film, since the actual setting in the film is Africa as well. The director included extremely powerful scenes to truly get the whole purpose of the movie across, how child soldiers come about and how traumatic and scarring of an experience it can be. Scenes such as Agu getting ripped away from his mother at the start, being pressured into splitting an innocent man's skull, having to witness his friends die all left the viewer speechless. The final scenes of Agu having to now attempt the almost impossible adjustment back into everyday life also shows the audience how Agu's struggles will never really cease since he had seen and done such horrible things at such a young, and impressionable age. The impact of this film creates is indescribable. The amount of detail that Fukunaga put into this movie in order to make Beasts of No Nation such a gripping and catching film is extraordinary. As the watcher, you are pulled in from the start and immediately sympathize with this poor young boy who was once playing in the street with his friends, and now is fighting in a war that he doesn't even know the cause of. The film was also fairly accurate. Children being abducted and morphed into child soldiers happens all across Africa far too frequently in areas such as South Sudan or northern Ugandan. Sadly this is a reality that can be seen all across Africa, children being separated from their families and being forced to join the fight, stories very similar to that of Agu's. All in all, this movie is a must see. Right from the start the audience is hooked, eager to see what becomes of this poor, unfortunate boy. It gives a clear statement and purpose of child slavery and its effects while also still keeping the viewer entertained. The filmmaking is fantastic as well as the acting making is overall just a great film. Beast of No Nation will leave you speechless and in awe."
" Beasts Of No Nation... Very good
",0.2484,-0.7485,2017-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Beasts of No Nation is a Netflix original movie about Child slavery and its role during an African civil war. It is not known in which African country this movie takes place in but the idea was to show that situations like this movie happen in virtually every African country. The film takes us through the life of an African village boy named Agu (Abraham Attah). He is just a normal African boy in a buffer zone at first. What seem to be African rebels come through the village and start to kill anything that moves. Agu witnesses his father and big brother get assassinated by these rebels but he manages to escape. He then gets captured by the rebel group that he would end up joining. The Commandant brings Agu under his wing along with the other ruthless savages and he slowly becomes a rebel, like the ones that killed Agu's brother and father. Agu basically gets brainwashed into something he hated aka African Rebels. Overall, this movie does a fantastic job showing how child slavery really can effect a Civil War. It does a great job showing the psychological brainwash of making a child soldier as well. Abraham Attah aka the actor that plays Agu did an exceptional job as his role as the little African boy. Personally one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The film itself surprised me. I thought this movie was gonna be maybe a little boring but, it was the opposite. I really enjoyed it. The picture was phenomenal. The acting was pretty good as well, headlined by Abraham Attah's portrayal of the fictional Agu. If i had to rate this movie I would give it 8 or 8 and a half stars out of 10."
" methodically brutal
",-0.6249,0.1119,2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Agu is a young boy in an unnamed African nation in the midst of a civil war. There are no services or school for him and his young friends. His father is a local leader. He lives in a buffer zone protected by Nigerian peacekeepers until the peace collapses. Government forces massacre the local population. Agu escapes as his father and brother are killed. He is captured by a rebel force led by Commandant (Idris Elba) who grooms him to be a child soldier.This is a methodical depiction of the brutalization of a childhood. Idris Elba has a commanding powerful presence. The kid is an appealing performer. That's why his corruption is so demoralizing. It's a harsh, heart-breaking movie. It's a Netflix movie that is cinematic in quality. The plot is pretty simple and the kid's journey is relatively straight forward. Fukunaga delivers an unflinching look into this slice of the world."
" Outrage
",-0.5106,0.9548,2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"You know when you hear other people whining about not being nominated for an Academy Award and you watch this movie, you kind of should be able to see through those other people. It's a real shame though that Idris did not get nominated and also the kid, the main star of the movie, whose giving a powerful performance.But if you don't care about nominations and/or wins, but do care about really powerful movies, that do challenge you, you shouldn't care anyway. You should just watch this and be awed by it. It's really good and it will stay with you. It seems like an accurate look at states without real leadership. Where any party thinks they are the good guys and therefor are allowed to do what they want ... But is it that easy? And how do you get people to follow you? There are some tricks of course and you will see some depicted here ... watch but beware that this is not made for entertainment purposes only"
