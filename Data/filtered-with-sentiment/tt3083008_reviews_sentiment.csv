" Lance Armstrong dopes his way to the top
",0.2023,0.9851,2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"Sports journalist David Walsh (an excellent performance by Chris Dowd) smells a rat after cancer survivor and champion cyclist Lance Armstrong (superbly played with steely conviction by Ben Foster) rebounds from the disease and keeps winning the Tour de France over and over again. Walsh rightfully suspects that Armstrong is using performance-enhancing drugs, but has a hard time convincing his colleagues about it.Director Stephen Frears keeps the gripping story moving along at a constant pace as well as maintains a serious probing tone throughout. John Hodge's tough script not only covers in fascinating detail how exactly Armstrong pulled off his bold doping program, but also points out how Armstrong used his fame and power to get away with it for so long.Foster totally nails Armstrong: Arrogant, charismatic, and ruthlessly driven, Armstrong was basically a narcissistic sociopath who was bound and determined to win at any cost. Moreover, the are sturdy supporting contributions from Jesse Plemons as the conflicted Floyd Landis, Guillaume Canet as the unscrupulous Dr. Ferrari, Denis Menchet as pragmatic team director Johan Bruyneel, and Dustin Hoffman as cagey risk insurer Bob Hamman. A solid and satisfying film."
" Savage obsession to Win
",-0.1531,-0.962,2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"The evil PED performance enhancing drugs, do absolutely nothing in my mind to detract from or humiliates Armstrong. It is all part of a laser focused and furious determination to win at any cost. Likely not one person is left on earth that does not take some enhancing drug, even if aspirin. The demonization of drugs is barbaric and serves the financial purposes of gutless conservatives, who we later find are murderers and pedophiles. Every athlete, businessman, muscian, junkie, takes something.
Armstrong did nothing but show how far human potential can go.He took drugs to fight his cancer, he took drugs to win his races, and he probably took drugs to just get high sometimes. So What?
It is a world of drugs. Criminalizing them means we are all criminals just so parasitic ""authorities"" can have a lucrative ""criminal industry."" Armstrong wants what everyone is programmed to want...and he gave a lot back too.
How many star athletes set up cancer foundations? How many young men, even in fantastic condition, could win that race 7 times no matter what they did to their bodies?
In his great obsession there simply were no boundaries to pushing his self-potential. He hurt no one and helped and inspired many.
I say some steroids do NOTHING to diminish his accomplishment and he earned everything he got....but then, we have the same birthday, maybe that's it"
" A cycle of corruption and cheating exposed...
",-0.5574,0.9825,2020-06-01 00:00:00,6,"Ben Foster is pretty good in this story of the rise and fall of seven time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong. When David Walsh (Chris O'Dowd), a journalist with the ""Sunday Times"" begins to doubt the integrity of the American super-cyclist, he convinces his editor to let him do some digging. Despite frequent public, and sometimes quite vitriolic, protestations of innocence from Armstrong and a fairly well documented backlash from the sport and his colleagues in the press corps he perseveres with his determination to prove that they are all just one step ahead of the rather haphazard drugs testing procedures. The history of the man, and of the impact of his antics on world cycling is public record, what Stephen Frears does here is try to put some meat on the bones of the news by attempting to characterise the people involved; and with Armstrong he presents us with a dedicated, ruthless, ambitious individual; but one on whom many others were perfectly happy to piggy-back off. He was clearly as inspirational to some as he was toxic to others; and were it not for his own arrogance - ably displayed here by Foster; and the ultimate betrayal by a disgruntled former team-mate, he may well have escaped Scot-free. Dustin Hoffman makes a few, unremarkable, appearances as Bob Harman and Jesse Plemons is quite good as Floyd Landis. As ever with these personalisation efforts, it's all guesswork; but I think on balance this might be nearer the truth than not..."
" Really enjoyed this
",0.5563,0.4557,2020-05-31 00:00:00,9,"But I must confess to not being a supremely dedicated cycling fan and wasn't aware of the details of Armstrong's case prior to watching this so part of my entertainment was fuelled by finding out more about what actually happened and went on, and I can appreciate you may feel differently if you already know the details"
" Th Outline
",0.0,0.8774,2020-05-25 00:00:00,6,"The story of Lance Armstrong is both amazing and horrific, but it's unclear what purpose was in Stephen Frears's mind when turning it into a film. The story was, after all, one we all watched live as it was happening; and then saw again, with the missing bits filled in, in numerous documentaties and interviews when he finally came clean. 'The Program' reconstructs all this, but Ben Foster in the lead role struggles with his accent and also fails to fully capture Armstrong's intensity; the plot is pretty much accurate but necessarily schematic. Armstrong is a hard man to like, and the film fails to add much depth to his media self-presentation. Perhaps because of this, it spends quite a lot of time with his former protege Floyd Landis; and one wonders if a film centred on the latter might not in fact have given more freedom to explore the subject and develop characters freer of the bonds of Armstrong's too-well established personal narrative. As it is, Frears has produced a film the Guardian called ""efficient""; but less efficient, and less emotionally engaging, than the documentary treatments the subject has been given elsewhere."
" The Program
",0.0,0.9032,2020-05-25 00:00:00,5,"David Walsh is the journalist who finally managed to crack Lance Armstrong's reputation. He saw that cyclists were completing the Tour de France faster and faster.The cyclists were climbing mountains so fast that they had to use brakes while going up. Other journalists were happy to ignore this, they rather eat soup from the trough.Stephen Frears have made a brisk film about Lance Armstrong's seven Le Tour victories. A bit too nippy at times, he meets a woman one minute, marries her the next and she is never to be seen again. Was the movie on EPO?Ben Foster is the ultra competitive and arrogant Armstrong. A man who just wants to win at all costs. He also has some menace if you want to blab your mouth to some journalists.There is a strong performance from Jesse Plemons as Floyd Landis. From a religious family, he provided pivotal support to Armstrong but his own moment of Le Tour glory was short lived, he failed a drug test and was cast out.This is a solid movie but it never quiet captures the drama that some of the documentaries about Armstrong has had. Also some key players were absent such as Armstrong's tiff with ex American Le Tour champion Greg LeMond."
" The Program
",0.0,0.9896,2020-04-30 00:00:00,5,"I had always heard about the doping scandal involving Lance Armstrong, it sounded like the kind of subject that would make a good film, but his whole life and career is full of ups and downs suitable for a biopic, and there came this one, directed by Stephen Frears (My Beautiful Laundrette, The Queen, Florence Foster Jenkins, Victoria & Abdul). Based on the true story, Lance Armstrong (Ben Foster) was an up-and-coming cyclist, with notable success between 1993 and 1995 in the World Championship, the Tour DuPont, and a handful of stage victories in Europe, including the Tour de France. In 1996, he was diagnosed with potentially fatal metastatic testicular cancer, during which he underwent a treatment of many drugs and chemotherapy. After his recovery, he returned to professional cycling in 1997, more determined to more determined than ever and with his sights set firmly on winning the Tour de France. With the help of the infamous Italian physician Michele Ferrari (Guillaume Canet) and team director Johan Bruyneel (Denis Ménochet), the most sophisticated doping program in the history of the sport was created. This program allowed Lance and his American teammates, including Floyd Landis (Jesse Plemons), to dominate the world of cycling. Armstrong himself went on to win the Tour de France an unprecedented seven times, between 1999-2005. However, there were many sceptics who believed that Armstrong and others were using performance enhancing drugs and/or steroids. Sunday Times journalist David Walsh (Chris O'Dowd) was at first charmed by Lance's charisma and talent but came to question whether the ""world's greatest athlete"" was ""clean"". In various interviews and press conferences, Armstrong denied the use of being fuelled by any banned substances. But the relentless Walsh eventually uncovered the truth about the program when a select few prepared to talk came forward. Finally, in 2013, Armstrong made a full confession of the doping throughout his career in a television interview with Oprah Winfrey. Following this, Armstrong was found guilty when blood tests confirmed positive for doping, he was officially disqualified from all his victories, and stripped of all his medals. Also starring Lee Pace as Bill Stapleton, Dustin Hoffman as Bob Hamman, Edward Hogg as Frankie Andreu, Elaine Cassidy as Betsy Andreu and Michael G. Wilson (James Bond writer and producer) as Lance's Doctor. Foster is a spot on spitting image of Armstrong, the cancer scare was somewhat skimmed through, but most of the stuff about the medical deception and the investigation is relatively well done, it could have been slightly more gripping, but overall it is a fairly interesting biographical sports drama. Worth watching!"
" glorifies this cheating scumbag
",-0.6808,0.6705,2020-04-07 00:00:00,3,"Too much of this tries to show his smarmy humanitarian efforts, which were clearly, to me anyway, thewre just to placate the masses regarding his true intentions."
" Sticks Doggedly to a Path Already Cycled!
",0.0,0.9633,2019-10-07 00:00:00,6,"The Program plays like a semi-documentary in giving us a realistic, bird's eye look at some of the disgraceful doping practices, that came to blight the late 20th century/early 21st century Tour de France bicycle races, involving American cyclist Lance Armstrong and his back-up team. Unfortunately that is also the film's problem. Despite a grimly, compelling performance from Ben Foster as Armstrong, the screenplay and direction allow no serious examination of what really made Armstrong into the ruthlessly, robotic competitor into which he evolved. There is nothing of Armstrong's early family life pre-international competition and it is virtually a red herring later in the movie, when we see him get married, because oddly, we don't see any further scenes of him interrelating with his spouse, at all.Chris O'Dowd gives a typically workman-like performance as David Walsh, an early fan of Armstrong, who was later one of the first well-known sports journalists to question Armstrong's incredibly quick recovery from testicular cancer and then upward movement through the international cycling standards. But the film is really about Armstrong and his role both as a lead cyclist for his team and the leading advocate for a systematic doping of himself and all his teammates to give them a winning edge in team events of the big races.Foster, as mentioned is chillingly effective as the dangerously charismatic Armstrong. Jesse Piemons also adds interest as the Mennonite rider Floyd Landis, who became Armstrong's lieutenant, or chief domestique, pushing the pace in the mountains to break the pack before Armstrong took off on his own to win the stage. But his character suffers from a sketchy, underwritten conclusion, after being refused any assistance by Armstrong, after Landis is caught for doping after winning the 2006 Tour.Cycling and general sports lovers will find plenty of interest in The Program. But those seeking any (even fictional) insights into the Armstrong well known narcissistic psyche may be sorely disappointed."
" A bit flat
",0.0,-0.2144,2019-10-05 00:00:00,6,"This dramatization of Lance Armstrong's career is a bit flat. There are a couple of documentaries which are far more compelling and effective in telling this story. The real life Lance Armstrong -- a bully, a liar and a cheat -- was a more powerful and power-hungry figure than the one portrayed by Ben Foster."
" Not bad, but a bit boring, because the actual facts and documentary about the doping fraud are much more fascinating than this movie.
",-0.2583,-0.9462,2019-08-08 00:00:00,4,"I wonder what's the point of watching this movie, when the real story, portrayed in the news and in a fascinating documentary is much more exciting. Director Stephen Frears isnt a great drama director and although this doping affair has lots of drama, it cant be found in this movie. The documentary "" Stop at Nothing: The Lance Armstrong Story"", is much more riveting and shocking than Stephen Frear's version of the doping scandal.It is not a bad movie, it is just a bit boring. Better watch the fascinating, shocking documentary "" Stop at nothing"", which shows in great detail a side of Lance Armstrong that is truly scary, because this man has lied to hundreds of millions of people, right into their face. The evil schemes with which he tried to silence witnesses are the most shocking part of this documentary "" Stop at Nothing"". None of that dramatic venom is to be found in great quantities in "" The Program"" though. It is definitely a bit boring. What a bummer...."
" Fine Representation Of Events
",0.2023,0.8351,2019-06-23 00:00:00,7,"As someone who didn't know much about Lance Armstrong this movie was a good opportunity to learn about the circumstances surrounding his rise and fall. It's not a terribly well-made movie, and the pace at which they moved through the events didn't allow the weight of each occurrence to sink in as well as it might have otherwise, but I found it to be an entertaining and digestible representation of the whole affair."
" Not dissapointment, not enough neighter
",0.0,0.6769,2019-06-09 00:00:00,7,"Of course, it's a respectable effort to documentise a (true) fraud story by the art of cinema. And of course, Stephen Frears has a brilliant cinema carrier. However, eventhough the film was not boring or tasteless, it presented lack of real Frears aesthetic and generally, directing of photography was far away from a satisfying experience for me."
" All in all a great movie
",0.6249,0.6187,2019-03-12 00:00:00,8,"Ben Foster's performance was impressive and gave a good inside-view of the character. The scene after he made his comeback where he only finished third and the press conference preperation are great. But the movie also missed out on some important things, the portrait of the journalist was a bit one-sided and I still wonder, why the didn't include Jan Ullrich."
" No personal touch..increases GK...fails to impact hearts..Ben Foster is Marvellous
",-0.296,0.6601,2018-09-14 00:00:00,8,"The Program(2015)The film deals with the dope controversy around Lance Armstrong(Ben Foster)which was triggered initially by an Irish reporter David Walsh(Chris O'Dowd).
Armstrong is brought brilliantly to life by Ben Foster.The performance is genuine and Foster is physically and mentally the controversial cyclist in every aspect.The lust to win at any cost be it hook or by crook is the objective of Lance Armstrong,and Foster has nailed every bit of it, be it with his body language or his emotional breakdown whenever seeing a cancer patient.The film doesn't portray Armstrong a hero or nor the character was justified for taking drugs, he is shown from the pov of a third person.His personal life is not brought into light neither his struggles during his cancer period which if portrayed, certainly the film will have been better.David Walsh is played well by Chris Odow'd. Actually the film is based on a book by David Walsh.The performance which also struck the right chords is of Jesse Plemons who plays here the character Of Floyd Landis, another fellow cyclist who is quite a complex character.Plemons is on to his best in the role.The film lacks the depth that usually these ports drama do and sometimes looks like a documentary but it actually put more shame to the character of Lance Armstrong..A man who became the symbol of hope from dope."
" Surprisingly weak film given the material
",-0.1779,0.8759,2018-08-01 00:00:00,5,"I'm a cycling fan and a film lover. I cheered for Armstrong, followed his downfall, read all the books (Walsh, Hamilton, Landis etc). The true story has plenty of drama and incredible characters. However, this movie, which I really wanted to like, is a rather anaemic version of that story. Ben Foster works hard but just isn't as impactful, as imposing or as dramatic as Armstrong himself. Events move too quickly to really get the measure of them. Perhaps it's too big a story to tell, but the documentary versions do better."
" Entertaining Expose
",0.3182,0.516,2018-04-26 00:00:00,9,The awful Lance Armstrong deception in an entertaining and faithful biopic. Acting and production are great. Better than the documentary The Armstrong Lie which was too soft on the cheat. We get to see how it was done and the number of people involved - which is staggering! The weakness of the press and the authorities is shown up. Based upon a book by an Irish journalist who revealed the truth and unbelievably got sued by Armstrong for doing so. Well acted by the lead who has Armstrong's mannerisms and arrogance down to a T.
" Good movie but......
",0.4404,-0.9944,2018-01-07 00:00:00,7,"As a sports fan, this movie involving one of the darkest scandals in its history was something I had to see. Having watch it, I can say I enjoyed it but felt as though it could have been better and the story could have had more depth to it. Ben Foster is nothing short of a revelation in his portrayal of the controversial figure of Lance Armstrong and his many faces, the public charismatic sportsman and champion in the fight against cancer to the behind the scenes ruthless bully who threatened to destroy anyone or anything who got in his way. Likewise Chris O'Dowd as the journalist David Walsh who steadfast refused to give into intimidation and didn't allow himself to be fooled by the deception. Jesse Plemons performance as the conflicted Floyd Landis who played a key role in the investigation was also a positive for the movie, likewise Dustin Hoffman as Bob Hamman.One issue I had with the movie was the skimming over of a few key events. Not the cycling as such, but the USADA investigation which would expose the extent of Armstrong's cheating, Armstrong's legal attempts to block it, and the death threats issued to those involved were covered almost as an after thought near the end of the movie, this should've been given more time in the movie as it was a key element in the whole affair. One frustrating aspect of this movie was almost the complete omission of two key players in the story, Greg LeMond, the ex-TDF winner who was almost ruined by Armstrong because he dared to speak out against him, and Travis Tygart, the head of the USADA investigation which ultimately exposed the doping scandal, who as previously mentioned was subjected to a number of death threats, were barely mentioned. Considering the part they played in the whole saga, this was a big error on the part of the movie.This movie was enjoyable and fascinating, but I felt it was partially undermined by skimming over several key events and the omission of some key people."
" Very underrated sports biopic
",0.0,0.9683,2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"I have been really surprised by the number of negative reviews of this movie. I've never really been a fan of cycling or the Tour De France, but I was always fascinated in how Lance Armstrong was able to cheat his way to 7 tour victories. And I think Stephen Frears has done a superb job of explaining the lengths Armstrong and his team mates went to,to beat the testers. Ben Foster is superb as Armstrong to the point I almost felt it was him, whilst Chris O Dowd is equally believable as the much maligned journalist who always new the truth. One of the best sports movies in recent memory 8/10"
" The Program Leans on Its Cast and an Interesting Story to Make up for a Few Things
",0.4019,0.9889,2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Lance Armstrong had a pretty drastic fall from grace. He was synonymous with athletes like Michael Jordan, Joe Montana and Serena Williams. Then the news came out about what he had done to win those 7 Tour De Frances and his legacy crumbled overnight. It definitely seemed like an appropriate subject to do a biopic about so I remembered The Program when I got the chance to catch it on DVD. I would have thought that this movie would have got some more attention, Ben Foster has always seemed like he was one key role from being an A list star. So this was the kind of project that might get him there. The Program opened in a limited release to a decidedly mixed reception and while I'm happy to talk about it, I think I'm going to echo what other reviewers have said. This is an absorbing story of betrayal and deception but the movie seemed very eager to tell it's own version of events instead of presenting a more unbiased look at Lance Armstrong's story.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Lance Armstrong (Ben Foster) is just starting out and he's meeting up with journalist David Walsh (Chris O'Dowd) to discuss his team and his chances. They bond over a game of Foosball and David is impressed with Lance. Lance is behind the curve though and is looking for an edge. This leads him to Michele Ferrari (Guillaume Canet). Ferrari is reluctant to take him on, he doesn't have the optimal body type and his requirements are below Ferrari's standards. Lance claims he'll do what it takes and when Ferrari is about to take him on and Lance begins to succeed, he gets diagnosed with testicular cancer and his fight to get to the top takes on a whole new challenge. Ben Foster has always been underrated in the way that he's always providing solid supporting work in bigger projects. He throws a lot into his performance as Lance Armstrong. He's painted as a complete villain and Foster is up to the task, radiating arrogance and spitting venom at whoever gets in his way. I also really liked Chris O'Dowd as David Walsh, he's clearly the white knight in the movie. His character is single-minded and also arrogant but he doesn't overplay it and you get where he's coming from. I was impressed with the supporting cast: Jesse Plemons, Guillaume Canet, Denis Ménochet, Lee Pace and Dustin Hoffman all fit within the movie nicely and there wasn't a sub-par performance in the bunch.The Program does a good job of dramatizing the story of Lance Armstrong. I had a couple of issues with how they decided to tell it (more on that later) but I remained interested in the movie throughout. If you're familiar with Lance's story even a little bit, you might know it didn't come to a clean end and the fallout was pretty severe. The movie borders on being a thriller with him hiding drugs and circumventing the regulatory bodies. You probably know how this story ends but that didn't bother me, the ending was a little anti-climactic but the movie achieved what it wanted to achieve.The Program just had one big flaw for me. This movie picks sides almost immediately and does almost everything it can to make you hate Armstrong. I understand that there is inherent bias in everything and it's not the movie's job to present this subject like a documentary. It's based on true events, as opposed to reporting the facts. But The Program doesn't even approach being objective. I'm also saying this while largely being on The Program's side. Reports about Lance Armstrong describe his behaviour as bordering on psychotic and completely obsessive and his achievements are now tainted because of his cheating. But the guy did raise millions of dollars for cancer research and he revitalized cycling. It's okay to not be completely down the middle but you have to compensate by making an excellent film (e.g. Snowden) and for me this movie didn't hit those heights.I would re-iterate that The Program did present an interesting story and made it dramatic enough to be entertaining. It just didn't reach high enough to hit iconic biopic status and it was a little embarrassing to what lengths they drove this movie trying to sway viewer opinion. I think they would have been better served diving deeper into Lance's motivations and showing the complete picture around his life. With that said, this was still worth a watch to see Ben Foster giving it his all and learning some of the finer points around Armstrong's story."
