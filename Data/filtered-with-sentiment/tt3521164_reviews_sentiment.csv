" Boring, boring Boring!
",-0.7345,0.9606,2021-03-29 00:00:00,3,I fall asleep and every time I have to see this movie! It's a good concept but 1/2 the movie is just her on a boat ! I don't understand why people love this movie so much. Minimal action and very tedious. Mulan or Beauty and the beast are much better disney movies.
" Beautiful story
",0.5994,0.9806,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"It has a carefully crafted, beautiful story full of valuable messages for young minds. The story is zestful and non repetitive which makes it a joy ride. Soundtrack is also very good. We are still listening it almost every day with our kid.It's not a cliche love story, not full of stereotypes and definitely not an meaningless action pack.We really liked the warm, meaningful story and valuable messages for kids (and adults) inside. Definitely recommended."
" My Daughters Favorite
",0.4588,0.9584,2021-03-17 00:00:00,10,"I have seen this movie over a thousand times (not exaggerating) and I am still not tired of it. The music is of course amazing, the story great, and the voice cast was top notch. This movie is a great family film and I highly recommend it."
" Best Disney movie I ever watched
",0.6369,0.9964,2021-03-16 00:00:00,9,"At first I wasn't interested with the movie because it's very different from the other movies, but it turns out the movie was very good and very inspiring.The visuals in this movie are gorgeous! Moana is beautiful, smart and relatable person. Also, the chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are also charming, catchy and fun. And last but not least, this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt.The movie is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I want to see it again!"
" Really great
",0.659,0.9467,2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Moana is like a modern Disney classic. It's got great songs, great characters, and a really cool world. Very nice."
" Beautiful movie some pacing problems
",0.296,0.9842,2021-02-27 00:00:00,7,"I was going to give this movie an 8 then I realized I had given 8 to the little mermaid so this ended up being a 7. Moana is a beautiful movie the animation is AMAZING. The characters are lovable, and the script is pretty good however there are some problems with the pacing. Parts of the movie just felt boring for me and I didn't find the songs to be as stellar as other Disney movies. The most memorable songs for me where ""Where you are"" and Moana's main song but Maui and Tomatoa's songs were slightly annoying. I also enjoyed the cultural aspect of it and the artistic way they depicted Hawaiian culture( although I am not Hawaiian so I'm not sure how culturally accurate this is) it was beautiful. Despite its faults the movie has heart which is something Disney movies have been lacking recently.Summary
Characters: 8/10
Script:8/10

Animation: 10\10 gorgeous!

Better than Frozen and Zootopia though not as good as Tangled and the Disney Renaissance"
" The Rock is what saved this film for me
",0.4215,0.9801,2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,"You know what I don't like, everybody making a big deal out of this female empowerment in Disney movies, they act like it's the best thing ever, Frozen is the most guilty of this. Now I don't mind feminism in films but Disney has done this more than once now and it's not new anymore, it's just like it's a marketing tool now, Jesus it was done before Frozen was released and everyone made such a big deal out of it like it was the second coming of Christ. Remember Brave? No you don't cause it didn't do very good at the box office but it did feminism first but since it just got forgotten Frozen took the spotlight and after seeing how much attention an okay Disney movie at best when compared to the massive catalog of quality movies that came before it, they have to do it again because Money. Just money. Which stems into another issue with movies today, what happened to passion and what happened to I don't know AN ORIGINAL IDEA! Anyways the only redeeming quality of this film is Dwane ""The Rock"" Johnson as Maui, whenever he's on screen it makes it worth while because he's just so charming in that role and man what an introduction! You're Welcome is by far the best thing this movie has going for it and to Maui I have but one thing to say, Thank You!"
" A Disney Hit Full Of Adventure & Comedy!!
",0.658,0.9744,2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"The score and songs are awesome, the messages are touching and the plot is overall exciting including it's charming humor and great screenplay. Not to mention the film's smart ability to create very memorable characters and villains. One of Disney's ultimate best!! üëèüçø"
" Refreshing Disney Movie
",0.0,0.7469,2021-02-06 00:00:00,9,"Great fun, Disney movie. Similar vibe to Frozen, but just a smidge better. The songs do all sound the same, so potentially not as memorable, but I enjoyed them. Why, oh why did she take the chicken with her. The worst character ever conceived in Disney history."
" Beautiful animation with rich characters
",0.8176,0.994,2021-02-04 00:00:00,7,"Moana and Maui are strong characters. Moana is proud of her tribe's heritage and won't let anyone stand in her way. Maui is very similar to his voice actor's alto ego (The Rock), he's big and arrogant, but very likable. He also has nice tattoos. Together they complement each other perfectly and were a joy to watch. The soundtrack is great. They were really catchy, and hummable. My favourite character however wasn't one of the two leads but Heihei the chicken. Heihei is a chicken from the island that snuck onto the boat when Moana went on her adventure. This chicken was hilarious. Whether it was continually banging his head off a rock like a confused Woody Woodpecker or, on more than one occasion, walking off the edge of the boat into the sea. Overall, Moana is well developed film, it's funny, had great characters and a fantastic soundtrack."
" A Fantastic Musical
",0.5574,0.9976,2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Disney have made some undoubtedly great films since the turn of the century, but with the notable exception of Tangled, their musicals have been a bit hit or miss. But with that said, wow is this a hit. All of these songs are just absolute bangers. 'How Far I'll Go' is beautiful, 'Shiny' is obviously iconic, the opening song is a fun introduction to the film and even 'You're Welcome' is an enjoyable time. This might just be the best Disney soundtrack since Hunchback, or at a push The Lion King, it's that good. Moana is a really well developed character, the animation is beautiful to look at and the ending wraps all of the character arcs and the main story up perfectly. All of the side characters are loveable and enjoyable, with Maui and Tamatoa being my personal favourites. The actual musical score is fantastic, the performances are solid - I just love so much of this film. As far as negatives go, some of the slapstick fell a bit flat, and I was kind of annoyed at the main-characters-splitting-up-before-the-climax trope that was used here. But still, just a fantastic film, and definitely one I'd recommend."
" Beautiful movie for kids (and secretly the very grown up parents too)
",0.5994,0.8398,2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Solid story. Relatable cute characters. Fantastic animation (especially the water). And the soundtrack is just dope.
I'm a bit ashamed to admit how much I like this movie, even anonymously on the internet, but I do.
If you're looking for some lighthearted family entertainment, it doesn't get much better than this."

" A- (high 8). October 18' @AMC
",0.0,0.822,2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,Excellent musical numbers. Well animated. Well paced in the first half but loses some steam in the middle. Could use some more interesting action sequences to engage the audience more.
" Moana
",0.0,0.9862,2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,"Maui was one of the best modern Disney movies, and he was the undisputed best character in the movie The rock performance was excellent and was befitting the character and Moana's character was good, the comedy in the film was excellent The story of the film was very good The graphics and the design of the characters in the movie was great The songs of the film were beautiful."
" A Disney gem.
",0.0,0.8389,2020-12-07 00:00:00,8,"With a strong female lead Moana is a story with great songs and even greater visuals. In the colorful environment Moana is joined by Maui, who is expertly casted as Dwayne Johnson. The Cultures from the New Zealand area is shown in the story with respect, most of the voice actors are in fact from the New Zealand area. Unfortunately it is not flawless. One of the first challenges the two must overcome, I found a bit useless. And I did not care for the cave scene and song. However I understand why it was used. I would definitely recommend the movie."
" Amazing...
",0.0,0.994,2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"""Moana"" is an Animation - Adventure movie in which we watch a young girl trying to save her people by a terrible curse caused by the Demigod Maui. She needs to find Maui and help him set things right in order to save her people.I liked this animation movie because it had amazing visuals, a nice and very interesting plot which is based on Hawaiian mythology. The voices of both Dwayne Johnson as Maui and Auli'i Cravalho as Moana were an excellent choice. Regarding the direction which was made by Ron Clements and John Musker, it was very good and they both did an amazing job. In addition to this, I have to mention the beautiful music of this film and well it fitted in every different scene of it. Finally, I have to say that ""Moana"" is a simply beautiful animation film and I strongly recommend every parent to watch it with his/her children because I am sure that you will have a great family time watching it all together and you will gain something by watching it."
" Visually Stunning
",0.3818,0.9141,2020-12-05 00:00:00,8,"Yes, this follows the ""Disney"" formula to a ""t"", - scrappy girl ventures out on her own against daddy's wishes, and ends up saving the kingdom (this case it's an island) type of thing, but what sets it apart is how visually stunning this is. The animators worked overtime to give this film such a rich look that fits into an old folklore, that it does overtake he weak points of the story, and keeps you so captivated! Give it a watch!"
" Simply amazing
",0.5859,0.9788,2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,"This film is an epic in the truest sense and easily one of Disney's best ""Big Films"".It follows the classic ""quest"" type story of a girl growing up feeling she's destined for more than her quiet life and eventually finding she's the chosen one to go on a mission to save the world, but how it gets there is awe inspiring.The animation is second to none, at one point I had to do a double take that they didn't mix in a live action character. Thinking back to the original Toy Story, things have certainly come far.Unlike other Disney movies (and most movies in fact), Moana is perfectly capable of pursuing her goals completely by herself and doesn't have a love interest, which I think may be a first for a Disney film (it's actually a lot closer to a Miyazaki film in the way the hero is portrayed).The soundtrack is also exceptional, so much so that my 5 year old girl made me order the album after the film. The entire score evokes a sense of adventure and riding over the waves and is simply sublime.To sum up how good this film is, it was the second movie in which I've ever witnessed the theatre audience erupting into a round of applause when the credits rolled (the first was Interstellar).The movie no doubt has some flaws, but I'm giving it a 10 to balance out some unreasonably negative reviews on here, some of which read like they were written by people who have no seen the movie."
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9884,2020-11-14 00:00:00,9,"The movie begins rather slow. It starts off clich√©d and pretty predictable. But, it does pay off very well with the creative world building and the new characters found there with some fantastic songs. The animation is also spectacular with strong use of colour and some great presentation of the magic and the creatures lives in the village or in the sea. The characters also helps with great backstory and being a lot of fun. The only issue with the cast is that the villains doesn't have enough screen time that can be passed off as just an obstacle for Moana. This is a great Disney movie, and another timeless classic."
" Mulan in the Pacific, Visually mindblowing
",0.0,0.9595,2020-11-09 00:00:00,7,Certainly a milestone for animated films. Visually convincing and fantastically told. The film offers everything the heart desires for families as well as for lovers of animated films. Disney has created a wonderful film that also introduces us to a beautiful world.
" Old story with nice scenes and music
",0.4215,0.9305,2020-10-20 00:00:00,8,It's a pretty old school story of a kid chasing after her dream without much support from family and she finally made it. Quite similar to Coco. The pictures are as beautiful and thrilling as always and the music beautiful too.
" Hula
",0.0,0.8316,2020-10-06 00:00:00,10,Funny funny funny. I like the bit where the chicken caught on fire.
" THE BEST DISNEY MOVIE EVER
",0.6369,0.8555,2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,"This is yet the best disney movie ever made, the animation, screenplay,sound and strory line is outsanding,kids love the movie, and even adults
overall-10/10"
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.7744,2020-09-27 00:00:00,9,"I think the story is amazing and I love the feeling you get while watching it, really a happy movie. Two of the songs were amazing but I didn't really like the others! Must watch!"
" Moanavis fantastic!
",0.5983,0.9825,2020-09-25 00:00:00,10,"I never watched animated kids movies before I had a daughter at 43. No lion king, no Alladin, none of them. Now my daughter it 2 1/2 and I've seen maybe a dozen, and Moana is by far the best! It's a great movie for any age. Great music, wonderful story, and Moana is a very positive hero! I like that there is no love interest, that bit has been done to death! There are moments at the end that could possibly be a tad scary for little ones, though my daughter doesn't seem to take issue with it. Great movie. Bravo!"
" Yes, typical Disney but oh so well done
",0.6664,0.9863,2020-09-25 00:00:00,9,"I see a lot of criticism about this being a ""cookie cutter"" Disney and while it certainly true for a lot of elements in Moana, it really didn't bother me as it's extremely well put together. I usually get quite annoyed with the songs but here I thought they fit and weren't too obnoxious. Kids will love it and adults can enjoy it... I certainly did. I'm not the most emotional guy but some moments did really get so yeah, well done. One of my favorite non-Pixar animated Disney."
" HUGE let down, mediocre movie, terrible 3d!! 1st low rated disney!!
",-0.5163,0.5152,2020-09-18 00:00:00,3,"The 3d was non existent it had great animation but that's it, mediocre songs and story, my least favorite movie of Dwayne the rock Johnson and by far my least favorite 3d animated movie from Disney. Overall a let down dont see why so many 10s , it's no where near beauty and the beast , lion king, or the amazing 3d like tangled, I expect quality when its Disney especially 3d but got a real dud!!! Sorry rock, sorry Disney, my lowest rated dusney EVER!!"
" Excellent soundtrack and visually pleasing
",0.7964,0.8791,2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"I once heard that water and hair are the two most difficult and costly things to animate. If that is true, then Moana must have been an absolute chore for the team. Thankfully, their work was realized with beautiful animation that serves to accentuate Lin-Manuel Miranda's soundtrack. Moana is a great watch for kids and adults alike."
" An enjoyable film
",0.4404,0.9864,2020-09-06 00:00:00,7,"Good fun.I wasn't expecting 'Moana' to be quite so goofy and silly, in that sense the more serious ending doesn't quite fit, but I still felt suitably entertained throughout. The animation is nice, while the music is solid - even if Maui's ""You're Welcome"" is the only memorable song to me.Dwanye Johnson plays Maui, he is top notch from start-to-finish; obvious casting, but still a welcomed pick. Auli'i Cravalho (Moana) and Rachel House (Tala) are also up to the mark in their respective roles.Thought it would be greater, but that doesn't stop the fact that this is an enjoyable film."
" Everything about this movie is beautiful.
",0.5994,0.98,2020-08-20 00:00:00,8,"Well worth million of watches. The animation, the bright and beautiful colours and the storyline!! So much about this movie, with a great bit of humour, the storyline of the grandmother and the chicken and the pig!! Amazing and a great watch."
" Stunning
",0.3818,0.9432,2020-08-02 00:00:00,10,"The music is amazing, they are catchy, engaging and will make you want to sing along. The animation is one of the best, every single detail is realistic. The character is lovable. Overall it's an unforgettable movie that will make you want to watch again and again"
" Too much musical.
",0.0,-0.8845,2020-07-31 00:00:00,5,"The animation detail was insane, it looked so detailed. Te story was good I guess, but the whole film is ruined by how much singing it involves. There's dozens of songs, they annoy me so much. I'm not a fan of musicals, there are exeptions, but not this one."
" True Blue Disney Magic!
",0.4753,0.9959,2020-07-24 00:00:00,10,"I have always had a soft spot for the oceans of the world along with Polynesian cultures as they have a special place in the world and my heart, having once been to New Zealand before and entranced by Maori culture. What I like about this is the creative team at Disney did their homework and for once a virtually stereotype-free work (though one could argue that for Maui himself), while incorporating their best tricks that worked with The Lion King (another all-time favorite Disney movie of mine), such as give the protagonist a terribly tragedy, give him/her a sense of doubt, plus a lot of obstacles and spectacular scene where the protagonist meets antagonist. Moana herself is the perfect princess sporting a great look (regular build, skirt and crop top with tasteful amount of midriff) without going overly sexual like Ariel or Jasmine, plus the courage, compassion, and commitment that Mulan and Elsa showed, and to top it all off Auli i Cravalho, who voices and sings her is phenomenal. HeiHei, the dimwitted chicken is great comic relief, but don't rule out Maui, who's a great character wonderfully voiced by Dwayne Johnson, even proving he's a good singer too! The graphics are wonderful, really adding a sense of depth to the already well-written story with a sense of maturity making this something even adults who don't have kids can enjoy as well. There are a lot of great moments such as Moana's one-woman battle against the Kakamora, her tender moments with her grandmother that can resonate with anyone. My favorite song is ""How far I'll Go"" which is so enchanting to listen to with Cravalho's vocals hitting every note perfectly. All in all this one of my two favorite Disney movies."
" I don't like it not bad but is OVERRATED (7.6)
",0.0951,0.9311,2020-07-19 00:00:00,8,"It was a movie with high expectations oscar candidacy and get amazing comments from everyone I thought the movie would be great but I didn't like it.It bored me, I found the story ridiculous, it seemed like they wanted to make an old-style animation like the Brother Bear movie I felt like they tried to reflect the magic it had caught, but they couldn't catch the same atmosphere.I think the soundtrack of the movie was the most beautiful event. I admit it's a fun movie, but it's not beautiful and it's overrated."
" My favorite of the Disney princesses
",0.4588,0.9955,2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie SO MUCH! The music is gorgeous, the colors and visual aspects are stunning! I love the funny comic songs by Maui and the crab too! The whole thing is a masterpiece. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote a lot of the songs so it's no surprise I love the music. I love how Polynesian culture is represented. I love that the princess isn't saved by a prince and they ""live happily ever after"". It's a princess who has to be cunning and brave and work hard to save her people. These are the messages we need to send to young girls instead of the ideal that a handsome prince with rescue them one day and fix everything. Moana is my favorite Disney princess movie by a landslide."
" Excellent Disney film
",0.5719,0.9241,2020-07-13 00:00:00,8,This film is an excellent addition to the Disney Animated Canon. It has everything you'd want in a Disney film with a Polynesian twist. The mythological elements are tied into the film very deftly with amazing animation. The highlights are the funny and determined characters.

" The best of the modern Disney Princesses
",0.6369,0.8698,2020-07-08 00:00:00,10,"Out of all the modern Disney Princess Moana is my favourite. It was a better reinvention/subversion of the Disney model then Frozen was because it had a strong, independent protagionist who was learning how to be a leader and not interested in romance. There were also a few jokes at the expense of the Disney formula.Moana told a typical hero's journey story but it was done really well and had urgency because Moana had to save her world from environmental disaster. It was also a jolly good musical, which isn't surprising because Lin-Manuel Miranda co-wrote the music."
" Autotune
",0.0,-0.612,2020-07-07 00:00:00,8,"I have been a bit leery of DIsney Princess movies of late, since they seem to have fallen into rote modes. Frankly, I didn't care for Frozen at all, and was surprised when it did great business. However, I neither know nor care what most people want. I'm lucky if I know what I like after I've seen it, and I like this movie a lot. It's a real Hero's Journey, with a lot of story, and the roles of the characters keep shifting around. When I heard Maui's voice, I thought ""Is that Dwayne Johnson? And do I now know Dwayne Johnson's voice?"" When he began singing the best song of the movie I was convinced I was mistaken, but I was wrong. I was not mistaken, and apparently he can sing pleasantly.The songs are decent, although not as good as they were when Ashman was doing the lyrics, but reasonably effective. The story twisted and turned quite often in unexpected ways and a good time was had by All. Isn't that what seeing a movie in the theater is all about?"

" All the Beauty of Pre-Colonial Pacific
",0.5859,0.9871,2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,"The Spirit of the Civilizations of the Pacific shines through Moana. From the time she is a child, discovers Mother Earth Sea and rescues a baby turtle, until the moment of truth where she finds herself and saves the world.The motion design is superb and the screenplay honors the Culture of the Pacific Peoples.Walt Disney created an Oceanic Trust of scholarly and cultural advisers, and Pacific Islanders helped them find their way about the Wisdom of advanced civilizations who were self-sufficient and lived in harmony. Where society was tolerant and women enjoyed equal status with men. Where the literacy rate was high, the forefathers possessed a working judicial and legislative system and relationships were fluid between all the beings who coexisted in peace.Simply a masterpiece!"

" A refreshing Disney Princess
",0.0,0.9861,2020-06-25 00:00:00,10,"I believe Disney succeeded once again in producing a 3D animated film that will become timeless. They did it with Moana.The movie's strength is not its plot for it is simple. Its strengths are in its very convincing voice actors, more solid 3D animations (the stars, skies and seas, man!) and probably the best asset of the movie is its universally acclaimed soundtrack.Moana is a musical fantasy adventure film. It achieves in each genre - fantasy that's refreshing (Polynesian myths), adventure that's serves Disney standards (coconut pirates army and a treasure-hoarding crab) and musical that delivers to all ages (thanks to a team with Lin-Manuel Miranda).If there's another realization about Disney movies this year (along with Zootopia, The Jungle Book), it's that a romantic love story isn't always needed to make a movie great.Sometimes, we just need a fierce girl with a dress and an animal sidekick.And we're good to go."

" Disney has a new low standard
",-0.2732,0.5235,2020-06-19 00:00:00,1,"Whatever happened to casting singers or actors who can actually carry a tune? Whatever happened to Disney movies that had amazing soundtracks. It seems as though we've accepted the mediocrity of what Disney now is and we don't expect better or the best anymore. Watch a classic Disney film from 90's or early 2000's and tell me Disney hasn't lost their touch. I'm not saying this is a bad film, no, it's just ""good"". That's the problem. What's stopping them from hiring people who can really sing? The formula is really quite simple. They certainly have the money for it."
" Lin Manuel Miranda
",0.0,0.9648,2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,"Is a genius. Hate throwing that word around. The only other one I can think of in Hollywood is Vince Gilligan. The music is what stands out here but the movie offers much more. First off GIRL POWER. 2nd the animation is stunning. The water alone in the movie could stand up against anything from the studios of Pixar. Yes I know Disney and Pixar are one now but Moana is not a Pixar movie. Story isn't anything ground breaking but it's fine enough. Love the mad maxish scene, and off course the Bowie like turtle. Can go on but no need, just a really fun film with amazing music!!!"
" Such a good movie

",0.5707,0.9846,2020-05-31 00:00:00,10,"Hi there,I'm not gonna say much other than that I've watched this movie several times now with my young daughter, as she enjoys it so much. Consequently, what follows is just a short opinion from a dad and movie enthusiast.So what's great about this movie? Pretty much everything; the animation here is one of Pixar's finest works to date; the music is beautifully written and very catchy, the characters and their development feels real and the story's message is inspiringly positive and also educational for not just the little ones. Moana is not your typical princess fairy tale - it's an adventure set in one of the most beautiful settings on Earth.Ultimately, I believe this movie did not get the attention it deserved and if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it - whether you have kids or not."

" just a little historical trivia
",0.0,0.4019,2020-05-25 00:00:00,9,"I recently read information on this movie in regards to the historical content and commented on the 'long pause' of when the Polynesian people stopped sailing for a time. according to historians and anthropologists, it is suspected that even though they had developed the navigation practices of using the stars and currents it took time for them to develop sailing vessels that would allow them to sail against the current. this makes sense since previously it has been determined that they used the currents to sail to where they ended up in the earlier times. just thought I would share this here."
" An entertaining tale about a young woman who saves her people
",0.4404,0.9804,2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"I love Moana. It's an amusing movie about Moana, a chief's daughter, who navigates though the ocean with a demigod named Maui to save her people. It's feminist, has great characters, storytelling, and dialogue, and the ending was truly nice. If you haven't watched this very interesting movie, I recommend you do. You might be entertained."
" Really isn't great. Disney isn't getting any better.
",-0.7165,-0.9744,2020-05-20 00:00:00,4,"Who knew how ridiculously stupid and lazy Disney can get. Characters are practically the same as Finding Nemos', just think about it. Protagonist wishes to go beyond that which is forbidden, overprotective dad that lost someone they loved that caused them anxiety for their other loved ones, etc. The animation is of course really good. But that's really the best it gets. The characters and their motivations are dumb and predictable. The emotional scenes feel meaningless and forced. Some scenes don't make sense or have any reason to be there. The comedy is forced, poorly timed, horrid dialogue and illogical. The ending scene where Moana is trying to keep the heart of Te Fiti from falling into the water was so incredibly stupid. Throughout the entirety of this, what we'll loosely call a plot here, the ocean is an entity that constantly throws the stone back when it is thrown into the water. So the forced intensity of this scene just made me super angry. The humor in this movie sounds like it was made up by 7 year olds. The jokes aren't funny, they don't follow the logic of what has happened, and are unoriginal! Unoriginal!! How was this piece of crap movie ever released?!Not that this comes as a surprise, but this movie has so many clich√©s in it too! Namely, ""loved one dies in the most forced and lazy way possible that is said to be too weak to speak only to completely contradict that and barrage an entire load of forced predictable exposition"" clich√©. First ever Disney movie to break the 4th wall in a stupid and unfunny manner to think it's being clever when it really isn't. ""Protagonists stir up conflict for stupid forced reasons just before the climax"" clich√©. ""During what is supposed to be an emotional scene the protagonists' loved one that died early in the movie comes back for a couple minutes to motivate the protagonist to close up the plot"" clich√©. The list goes on.My thoughts about the songs, juuuuuust no. Disney has this pattern that is getting old. That one song in the whole movie known as the ""money maker"" or ""the big one"". That of which is ALWAYS by a female character. The songs themselves are most of the time, pretty good. But for promotional purposes they want to force the same song on you by adding a Pop cover for the end credits. Really doesn't make the song any better other than letting you know exactly what song they're trying to make the most money off of. And it WORKS! So dumb!Overall this is a stupid, unfunny, forgettable, forced, clich√©, rip-off of a superior movie. To prove my point of it not being funny, I remember nobody laughing throughout the whole movie. I would never watch this again or recommend this to ANYONE."

",0.6249,0.9186,2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"Maui, a demigod, steals the cornerstone of all creation: the heart of Te Fiti, resulting in the slow destruction of the ancient Polynesian islands. Moana, an island chieftain's daughter, must find Maui and set things right.""When you write using a bird's beak, it's called tweeting,"" declares Maui - an ancient demigod who has no business referencing Twitter. His charm is lost on Moana, but in this moment, you realize the kind of goofiness you're in for.The story comes from a Polynesian myth. Goddess Te Fiti creates all life and takes the form of an island. Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a shapeshifting hero, then steals her heart (a piece of glowing rock), bringing a curse upon all the surrounding islands. In the process, he also loses his magical fish hook and is rendered superpower-less. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), the princess of one such affected island, is chosen by the ocean to find Maui and restore the heart of Te Fiti.On paper, Moana is a quintessential Disney story: there's an aspirational princess; a flawed hero, quirky comic reliefs (a senile grandma, a brainless chicken); the promise of a happy ending and most importantly, the golden message of chasing what your heart desires.It's a narrative triumph, which is ironic, because the central idea itself is unoriginal to the core. One can't help but wonder: will we ever experience journey-away-from-home-to-find-metaphorical-treasures fatigue in animated films? You find big spoonfuls or tiny traces of it in almost all modern animation classics from Finding Nemo to Up to Inside Out, and Moana makes no efforts to take any detours.However, the movie chugs along with breathtaking animation, adorable interactions between the strong-willed girl and the hilariously self-obsessed demigod, and songs that make you shimmy involuntarily. There's even a Mad Max: Fury Road-inspired battle scene.Moana literally means 'the ocean' and as the heroine conquers her namesake, she also conquers your heart. You won't regret setting sail and voyaging with her."

After following both predestination and her own heart, and breaking the warning of not going out of the protected area, Moana embarks on her journey as a simple three-acts adventure: locating Maui, finding Maui's magic hook and finally, emboldened by the pep talk of her wise grandma Tala (House), takes it on herself to finish the daunting tsk, instead of being a sidekick of the shapeshifting and petulant demigod.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks!"
" Moana
",0.0,0.9983,2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"From the opening lyrics to the final shot, Moana was a fun glimpse into Polynesian life. Reminds me of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron with its depiction of tribal peoples, people who depend on the land and environment to live. As one of the several catchy songs say, the island gives them everything they need. No need to go beyond the reef.I'm glad that Moana and Zootopia, Disney's two most recent feature films, humorously refer to the archetypal Disney traits that appear in film after film -- i.e. an animal sidekick, the heroine bursting into song, following your dreams. Even if they do year after year, it never gets old. (... Well, maybe a little bit. I'm actually jaded by the happy ending trope in practically every work of film, literature, etc. out there. But that's beside the point.) Even if you can predict the ending of Moana, it's not quite what you expected. Disney has recently been changing things up a bit and having creative endings. Frozen, for example. Even if they weren't slightly creative, the story still enacts the Disney magic -- the ability to inspire, motivate, uplift, and ultimately enlighten further on mankind's communal desire to go beyond the norm. You don't have to do something amazing to make a name for yourself. It's not the hook that defines you, it's what you do that defines you and makes you who you are. Just don't follow hard tradition all the time. If someone says you can't achieve your dreams, he/she is most likely right. HOWEVER. That's only true if you don't give it your all. Those right now who are living their dreams gave it their all. If it's something you really want, after all, then naturally you'll give it the necessary effort and force of will. It won't be easy; life wasn't meant to be easy.It's not as amazing as Zootopia, but Moana is still a genuinely good Disney movie. It has a superb single, a nice accompanying soundtrack, great characters, sublime animation with crystal- clear attention to detail, and wonderful themes and messages. I admit, I was expecting too much from Moana after seeing Zootopia, which is probably why I give Moana a 9. Zootopia hits the 10. If you haven't seen either one, I recommend seeing Moana first."

This was essentially the antithesis to the Disney Princess movies. The songs in ""Frozen"" were a bit too Broadway for my taste, but the songs here were fun island tropical songs that were fun to dance to. And some of the lyrics are very clever. (Thanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda). There were also some likes of dialogue where I was laughing so hard I was crying. That hasn't happened in a long time. This was more of an adventure epic instead of a princess movie. ""Frozen"" was clearly aimed at little girls, but everyone can enjoy ""Moana."" There is a short before the film that while it was clever, all I could think during it was ""Disney copied their own thing. This is Inside Out with internal organs instead of the mind."" One of the villains in the movie who was voiced by Jemaine Clement was fun, but I wish he had tried to change his voice a bit, because all I could think was ""This is the bird from ""Rio"""". It was kind of distracting. This was a fun adventure movie that I give my highest regards.

Some details coming from the Maui culture are great too, or at least interesting and different.But the jokes don't work ever, of the six songs, only two are great (the ones representing the protagonists) and the other are awful.

(I know, that makes me a ""film nerd"" and I wear that badge proudly). In perusing the list, I saw that I had yet to see the 2016 Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Disney animated flick Moana, so thought I'd check it out.And...I'm glad I did...for I was thoroughly entertained by the story, the characters, the visuals and the music. How is this film not mentioned in the same breath with FROZEN? It is terrific.Set in the South Pacific, MOANA, the 56th Disney Animated film, tells the tale of...well...Moana...who works with the Demigod Maui to reverse a curse that he started.Hawaii native Auli'l Cravalho was perfectly cast as the voice of Moana, she is the perfect blend of perky, smart and grounded with a singing voice that is strong and bold. But this film belongs to Dwayne Johnson as Maui. His demigod is brash, egotistical, and cocky...but there is a tenderness and vulnerability to his character that makes Maui lovable and not arrogant and annoying. This is a delicate balance to make and Johnson balances it perfectly. He has a natural charm and charisma that shines through his characterization. I couldn't think of anyone else that could have pulled this role off - oh...did I mention - he sings!And that is another part of this film that I was surprised by. The music is first rate. As written by Lin-Manuel Miranda (Broadway's HAMILTON) and Opetaia Foa'i and Mark Mancina, the songs are joyous, fun and drive the plot and the characterizations forward. AS does the direction by Ron Clements and John Musker. It is a fast paced film that doesn't really slow down for audiences to think too much about the plot or plot machinations...and that is a good thing.Is it a perfect film? Well..no. I found the character of the Sea Creature Tamatoa (Jermaine Clement) and the accompanying song to be...""meh""...it was a bump in a fun road. And...the way the plot was resolved was not entirely satisfying for me.But...these are nits...for MOANA is more focused on the journey - and the relationship between Maui and Moana - than the destination. And this journey is a delightful one to go on.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take this to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

You have a heroine, and what I feel is the first real heroine in all of the animated films that I've watched. Most films make a forced effort to show girls that they can also excel and be whoever they choose. Moana takes a girl, who's also a princess by the way but an ordinary one, and allows her to truly explore, achieve, and save the world not through magic, extraordinary power or luck, but through hard work and perseverance. She is real. Maui is also the perfect comic relief and the Rock does an excellent job in this roll.My kids want to watch it again and so do I."

" Moana review
",0.0,0.9993,2020-02-05 00:00:00,8,"Synopsis
On the island of Motunui, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho (voice)) is chosen by the ocean to receive the heart of Te Fiti, an island goddess. When a curse caused by the missing heart reaches Motunui, Moana sets out to find the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson (voice)) and return the heart to its rightful place to lift the curse.Review
With Zootopia having been released earlier this year, Moana marks the first time since 2002 that Disney has released two animated feature films the same year (Lilo & Stitch and Treasure Planet were that year for those who are curious). And man, what a year it has been for Disney animation. Zootopia is an extraordinarily hard act to follow, being what could be considered the best film of what has become known as the Disney Revival Era. At least until now.First off, the voice casting is amazingly spot-on. First-timer Auli'i Cravalho does an astonishing job. The range of emotion that she is able to portray with simply her voice makes it hard to believe this is her first acting credit. You would think she was a seasoned veteran, just like Dwayne Johnson. Speakin of, I know that often animators will try to bring some part of the voice actor's likeness to a character but Maui is the spitting image of Johnson. Pretty much a caricature of him. Not only does Maui look like Johnson but he moves like him too. He even does the eyebrow thing! And the ""pec muscle thing"" as my sister so elegantly put it. But besides his looks, Johnson has the perfect voice for Maui.I am beginning to feel like a broken record when it comes to reviewing animated films. With every film released, the animation gets better and better and the gets more and more beautiful. The film takes place on the open water and on sandy beaches and in lush forests. The water glistens and sparkles and flows extremely life-like. This is probably the best water animation since Finding Nemo. One animation aspect that really surprised me was the characters' hair. Given the characters are sailing on the water for most of the movie, they were bound to get wet eventually. The way it looks heavier and bunches together and shimmers is, again, very life-like. I give the animators big kudos for getting something that can be easily overlooked to look so accurate.Like any Disney princess, Moana has her animal sidekicks. The one that steals the cake, however, is her dimwitted chicken Heihei, voiced by the versatile Alan Tadyk. When I say ""voiced"" I mean he makes sounds, he doesn't actually talk. Heihei is much like Maximus and Pascal from Tangled, well like most animal sidekicks really, where his humor comes from his actions. In a movie that is already filled with a decent amount of humor, Heihei added a unique touch that garnered laughs from every scene he was in.Like every Disney movie ever, there is a message to be found in Moana. What I like best about the message in this film is that both Moana and Maui deal with the same problem of doubt but they deal with it from different sources. Maui has self doubt, struggling internally with events from his past. Moana, on the other hand, deals with doubt from others, mainly her father, about whether she is truly ready to be chief of her tribe. They find strength in each other and both overcome those doubts. It was a crafty way for Disney to bring their message across.In recent years, Disney has become more focused on releasing films containing messages of self-empowerment, as seen in movies like Maleficent and Frozen. But where Moana differs from something like Frozen is that there is no prince or male love interest at all. Moana focuses on exactly that: Moana. It is all about her and finding finding power and confidence within herself to complete her journey to save her people.It wouldn't be a Disney princess movie without some musical numbers. Two songs that stood out to me the most were ""You're Welcome,"" sung by the surprising musical Johnson, and ""How Far I'll Go,"" sung by Cravalho. As much as I enjoyed the soundtrack, I will admit it is one of the weaker soundtracks of late from Disney animation. I don't think it will become as popular as some of their more recent films have become, such as Frozen, or have the longevity as several of Disney's other classic animated features, like The Lion King, but I wouldn't mind to be proven wrong on that.I thought Moana was GREAT :-D. Although the score might not be as catchy as other Disney favorites, it fits the setting beautifully, the same way Dwayne Johnson and Auli'i Cravalho completely embody Maui and Moana. I have really enjoyed the last several years of Disney animation, very reminiscent of the quality of films from when I was a kid. I wouldn't expect anything less from the directors who brought me my favorite Disney animated"
" This movie beats the hype
",0.0,0.967,2020-01-29 00:00:00,10,"I put off watching this movie for so long but now it's a daily necessity in my house. It's an amazing story, beautiful to look and and the songs really hit you in the feels. Such an empowering movie the likes of which resemble Mulan with a strong female lead that does what she needs to for her people."
" A Classic, Without the Substance
",0.0,0.9991,2020-01-14 00:00:00,5,"Moana is exactly the type of film you get when you want a movie with an acceptable amount of entertainment for adults and children, a cookie-cutter plot that could be subbed in to any time period and culture, a minimum of challenge and character development, and catchy tunes that people will get stuck in their heads. It is the simulacrum of Disney's hundred year plan, to develop and distribute the easiest and shallowest media to the greatest masses of consumers. If you simply wanted a victory lap of the collected anthology of Disney princess odysseys, this is a perfect film. If you wanted anything new that you hadn't seen before, consider a different film.I should start with the plot, or lack-thereof. This film has every hallmark of the young adult adventure down pat. A sense of disconnect between the hero and their community. A magical item. A cheesy sidekick who serves solely for comedic relief and adds nothing to the plot. The death of a loved one. Being ""the chosen one"". And finally, a journey into the unknown to save their community/country/the world. You will find all the classic tropes in Moana. It is the very face of predictability. In some ways, you really can't go wrong with a classic arc like that, but after seeing it so many times, you crave for more. You want something different that you didn't expect. Disney will throw in the occasional mild twist or turn, but nothing that's going to make you think for more than 5 seconds, and certainly nothing that's going to confuse or alienate any young, timid minds.It felt like there were several missed opportunities here. We get the majority of the second act hyping up this idea of mythical creatures, monsters and super powers. Maui is a demigod with a magical hook and the power to give humans the very lifeblood of existence. I was dying to see what awaited in the realm of the monsters. And then as soon as it began, it was over. We got all of ten minutes and one song in the underworld before it was over. I was craving for more. The most intriguing point of the whole movie and they glossed over it in an instant. We got to see, in total, three monsters, including a throw in of the ""there's always a bigger fish"" trope. The other missed opportunity was the adorable (so I thought) sidekick of Moana, Pua the Pig. The cute little white pig got only a few minutes of screen time before being shunned by Moana as she set off on her adventure. I was waiting for him to pop out of the underside of her boat, but alas, we didn't see him until the closing moments of the movie. So much for being a loyal supporter. You get left behind, and Hei-hei the idiot chicken gets the come instead. That being said, Hei-hei did give me the biggest laughs of the film.Despite all the criticism, there are some important parts that make the film enjoyable and at least worth one watch. Disney once again knocks it out of the park with their music. What can really be said that hasn't already about Disney musicals? They are the gold standard. They manage to tell a story while at the same time being catchy and fun. There is always at least one song in every Disney movie that you have to download and listen to on repeat for a week after you hear it. It has a set up piece, although perhaps a bit blunt and obvious, with Where You Are. A comedic song with You're Welcome, that will leave you saying ""I didn't know The Rock could sing..."" And of course, the heavy hitter, How Far I'll Go, that I can safely admit was stuck in my head for a long time.The attention to detail is also something rarely missed among these classic animated features. The richness in the presentation of Polynesian culture is certainly something to be admired, and it is always nice to see a film that explores a seldom seen corner of the world. The animation is always beautiful and well done. The colors throughout the film are warm and subtle when they need to be, aquatic and fresh without being over the top or overpowering. The little easter eggs and subtle graphical details are always a special charm when watching a Disney film.Moana is exactly what it needs to be. Not something that is going to challenge or polarize anyone, but a fun, light-hearted adventure that will keep everyone, young and old, engaged for 100 minutes. And certainly, it can be said that not every film needs to be evocative in order to be good. Where Moana lacks is in character development and a compelling plot. You never grip the arm of your chair and wonder if they will really make it in time. The climax and resolution are known from the moment you see the characters formulating the plot in the 10 minute mark. Everything will be fine. Truly, it is fine. Just relax and take in the summer breeze and the light spray of misty salt water as the waves roll by."

They created a princess story about a young woman working towards independence and self sufficiency with nary a love interest in sight. The music is beautiful, catchy and impactful. The movie makes me laugh, brings me to near tears and all the feels in between.I don't really even have negatives for this, aside from the stereotypical plot conveniences. Still, love this movie."

It turns out to be one of the studio's better recent productions. As usual, the slick and soulless animation style leaves me cold, and they still haven't fixed those dead eyes, but this one manages to have a half-decent storyline based on Polynesian mythology, which most viewers will know nothing about, that makes it stand out from the crowd. The songs have a nice local flavour too, and the whole thing is painless and enjoyable in a simplistic way."
" Cliche But Still Fun
",0.6652,0.9962,2019-12-25 00:00:00,7,"If you're a fan of Frozen or other Disney classics of the past you should enjoy yourself. Just do not expect anything new story wise or tropes wise. The film doesn't have any deep societal messages like Zootopia either. However, just because something is formulaic does not automatically make it bad. It's all in the execution and if it's able to bring something fresh and unique to the table to make-up for it. Disney, Pixar, and Marvel have been able to this and Moana is no exception.The story and characters are basic and nothing you haven't seen in other Disney films, or just other adventure films. You have the title character Moana that lives with her family and tribe on this remote island. She dreams of going out there and exploring beyond the island but everyone, including her family, tells her not to. But eventually an evil threatens their home and one of her family members dies. Now she has to venture out and face this threat along with her comic relief animal sidekick (who surprisingly does not speak in this) and trusted partner Maui (Dwayne Johnson). At first the two of them do not get along but eventually grow to respect one another. It hit virtually every Disney trope.However, the film manages to make-up for this in other areas. The visuals, music (some of it), and culture the films portrays is actually something new for Disney. The lore the movie presents is also quite different and interesting. Most of all, the film has heart, which is something Disney almost always has in its films.The acting is on-point from everyone in the cast. The visuals are stunning and the score perfectly complements them. The songs are great too. They're not as memorable as Frozen or other Disney classics, but they're above average. There is one song that, in my opinion, is on that level though.Overall, Moana is definitely a Disney film, in a good way. Again, if you like Frozen, Big Hero Six, or other Disney films like them you'll enjoy this. Children will definitely love it."

" A Worthy Addition to the Disney Lineup.
",0.4404,0.9978,2019-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Disney animation has an impressive repertoire of an array of films, but they're perhaps known above all for their princesses. Despite being perhaps Disney Animation's claim to fame, they've definitely slowed down on them in recent years. However, in 2016 there was another addition to the extensive Disney princess lineup, Moana. It's set in the South Pacific, with a Polynesian princess and accompanying aesthetic. Additionally, it's also a musical, another thing that gave Disney great fame and a lot of money, but has largely slowed down this century.As one would expect, Disney does a spectacular job at animating Polynesia and all the environments in this movie. The ocean looks incredible, and the amount of detail put into the water is outstanding, especially because the ocean is almost a character of its own in this movie. The other places, like the islands and any of the mystical places, also look great. Disney is known for having some of the highest quality animation in the world, and it shows here. The songs are also pretty good. The one people know most is You're Welcome, but honestly, most of that is probably from memes. How Far I'll Go is pretty good, and Shiny makes for a good villain song.Moana herself is a likable protagonist, although a bit much in the vein of some other recent characters, notably Merida from Brave. She's strong-willed and determined, which does make the audience want to root for her. Her backstory, in which she's the daughter of the chief who doesn't want her to go out on this quest, but she does so anyway. Maui, played by the Rock himself, is also a good character. The most memorable thing about him is probably his action sequences with his hook. Te Ka, who is silent, is the film's main villain, so it's nice that a Disney movie in the 2010s doesn't have a twist villain.Moana, all in all, is a worthy addition to Disney's extensive lineup. It wasn't quite the phenomenon that Frozen was, but I have a feeling that 2010s kids will remember this the same way Aladdin is remembered by 90s kids. So is there going to be a live-action Moana released in 2043?"
" such an inspiring movie
",0.4215,0.995,2019-05-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is made by walt disney, a big company that produced many great movies. This movie has a powerful story which is brilliantly animated, wonderfully acted and tells a great story. I think moana is a great movie because the animation seems real, so it looks like natural movies with touched animation. The plot is nice too, so I can understand the movie well, and for the voice over is really clear and good, thus I can understand every word that spoken from the movie better.The movie also has some really good songs which can entertaining the audiences, especially for children. This film is suitable for watched by family because of fascinating stories. In this movie, there are comedy scenes, so the audiences will amuse with that. This movie has a great story and from this movie, I got some moral lessons to keep the ocean and to never give up for something that seems impossible.I thought this movie is recommended to watched by extended family because it really entertaining and have moral lessons too. So we're not just watched the movie only, but we can take the message of this movie and apply it in our life and maybe it will open our mind to be brave, never give up to something like impossible to us, and also for loving the ocean more. I have been watching it several times, but I never bored because I really like and feel entertained to this movie."
" very interesting and unforgettable
",0.4576,0.9965,2019-05-12 00:00:00,9,"Since the first time I watched this film together with my friends, about 1 year ago, this film is still remembered in my memory. Especially the funny behavior of chickens in this film and the audio and visual settings is very interesting. This film can refresh our mind and give us motivation so that we never give up in life. Maybe this is the film I like the most.
Lots of messages that I can get from this film. For example, the heart is a valuable thing that is owned by someone, do not leave our friends who are in need of help because everything will be easier and more fun if done together, and we should not despair in pursuing any difficult goals. In this film, there are many problems that Moana must face. And that is not something that can be done easily. But she never gave up pursuing his goal. Moana is an independent, tough, and courageous woman facing various problems.
This film is very suitable to be watched together with your friends or your family and can be accepted by all ages, especially children. there are many singing and dancing scenes that make this film more interesting. There are also comedy scenes that will make the audience laugh out loud especially during the Moana pet innocent chicken scene named Heihei who always accompanies him wherever he goes. The selection of a very interesting place to make the audience seem to be carried away in a cool and refreshing atmosphere on a beautiful island coupled with the songs sung very beautiful and comfortable to hear even make the audience want to hear it again. You have to watch this movie! It very recommended!"
" Love this movie
",0.6369,0.9962,2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Having seen this movie loads of times before and being a fan of Disney I was so happy to give this another watch and review it. This is a film in which I always enjoy, makes me laugh and has songs in which I always find myself singing along to.I love that this film has the traditional Disney set up however has the girl as someone who is in charge and tying to save her people by going to the Gods and putting the heart back. I love that this has her having to find out the true history of her people in order to understand why it is so crucial for her to go and find the Demigod and how to help save her people from dying of starvation now that her island's life is starting to rot. I do think that the chicken in which is rather stupid is rather funny and he is one of my favourite characters and does make me laugh with just how much he doesn't realise what is really happening around him or what he is doing. The music as well within the movie is really catchy and very easy to get stuck in your head, making you sing along. Having the ending of the movie where Maui realised why the lava monster was coming after him and his past as well with him being born human was something I thought brought a lot of information about the character and helped the audience more connect with him. Having the heart of the land being taken and that was why the land was dying I thought was a really good touch and highlights how people need to look after the Earth or it will disappear and die around humanity.Overall, Moana is a great Disney film and one that I will watch again and again. I really hope that they make more like this as it is one in which I really enjoyed and one of my favourites from them in recent times. I would recommend this film to those who are a fan of Disney, animated movies and people who are looking for a film in which the whole family can watch and enjoy. This is definitely a film I will watch again."

" It's Fine
",0.2023,0.981,2019-03-31 00:00:00,3,"I've always stood by the belief that just because something is pretty does not make it good. This movie definitely reflects that sentiment. It is very pretty in its own right. It was beautifully animated and it a wonderfully colorful spectacle, but that's it. The characters themselves are very shallow in actual characterization. There is very little development that actually goes on between any of the characters, especially between Moana and Maui. What development that does happen is expected and not very original. It all also happens so quickly that there isn't enough time dedicated to the details needed to push their relationship or the story forward.And, as far as story goes, there really isn't much of one. It's a very simple quest that had so much potential to be a grand adventure, but it just wasn't there. There wasn't enough of an adventure to keep me engrossed. It played everything very safe and didn't take enough chances. It could have been so much more, but it just wasn't enough. So, it left me feeling kind of empty at the end. I wanted more from it and instead it was just like a passing moment. It's there, then It's gone, and I won't remember it later on.It honestly felt a lot like a sandbox game. Anything can happen because there isn't enough lore to set everything in stone, but at the same time nothing of significance can happen because there's nothing grounding it to a specific plot. Sadly, this isn't a game and the latter is the case for this movie. So much more could have happened, but instead not enough does to keep my interest."
" Moana Is Her Own Kind Of Princess

The ocean is beautifully portrayed in this animated film and it doesn't need to be live action to be a great Disney movie. Yes, people are complaining that as Disney grows and the years pass by, and people's expectations get higher and higher, new Disney movies are not as good as the old ones. But Moana definitely lived up to everyone's expectations and this movie is full of fun music and a beautiful story about a young, determined and brave girl."
" Moana Review
",0.0,0.9963,2019-03-23 00:00:00,9,"On Motunui, a small island in Polynesia, young Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is being raised to lead, but dreams of nautical adventure instead. Impending disaster causes her to finally head out past the reef, teaming up with a braggart demigod named Maui (Dwayne Johnson) on a mission involving a magical stone.
Back in 1963, Disney had huge success with a project tapping into Polynesian culture. It wasn't a movie, but a theme-park attraction called the Enchanted Tiki Room that surrounded visitors with singing animatronic birds. Amazingly, it's taken 50 years for the studio to get around to making a feature film based around the lore of the Pacific Islands. The good news is that Moana was worth the wait. The bad news is that it does not have a single singing bird, although there is a scene-stealingly idiotic chicken called Hei Hei.
Originally it looked like the movie was going to be called Maui: the name of the tattooed demigod voiced by Dwayne Johnson. It was his folkloric exploits that first grabbed the attention of directors Ron Clements and John Musker. Then they decided to make the lead character a 16-year-old girl instead, creating a bickering, True Grit-esque dynamic between her and Maui as they navigate cyan-blue seas. It turned out to be an inspired move: the relationship is relentlessly entertaining. ""I am not a princess,"" Moana insists. ""If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick, you're a princess,"" fires back Maui. She does and she has, but there's no love interest and she is every bit the equal to her big-chested, big-talking, curiously nipple-free companion. Like Frozen, it's a progressive Disney movie that nimbly dodges outdated tropes.
Also like Frozen, it's got some mighty music, thanks in no small measure to the involvement of Broadway smash Lin-Manuel Miranda. There are some parallels between this and the musical that made him famous: both Moana and Hamilton involve someone leaving a tropical island to achieve greatness (you could call this Clamilton), and both feature earworming anthems of empowerment (We Know The Way, featuring Miranda himself on pipes duty, is the one you'll be humming two days later). It's also hard to resist Johnson singing Miranda's You're Welcome: an ode to egotism that is simultaneously a perfect storm of delightfulness.
Story-wise Moana doesn't do anything radical. But visually it's always finding new riffs, whether with the moving tattoo on Maui's pec, a kind of inky Jiminy Cricket, or the sea itself, which transforms into an Abyss-style sentient wave to interact with our heroes. There's a gloriously surreal battle with the Kakamora (think the Smokers from Waterworld, if Dennis Hopper was a coconut). And perhaps most fun of all is the sequence in which Musker and Clements, the duo who brought us The Little Mermaid, take us back under the sea for a confrontation with a glammed-up hermit crab (Jemaine Clement), a foray into a realm of fluoro nightmares.
There's the odd dull stretch and dud line: ""When you have a bird to write with, it's called tweeting,"" is unlikely to age well. It turns out, though, that Polynesian mythology and the House of Mouse go together very well indeed. Between Moana and Zootopia/Zootropolis, it's been a banner year for Disney Animation. Pixar, watch your back."
" A joyous voyage
",0.6249,0.9773,2019-03-10 00:00:00,9,"What a glorious film! Through the plot development on all core caracters, complex relationships and truly personable individuals this is an adventure that had me 'hooked' (an inside pun for when you watch the movie) from start to finish.I will endeavour to avoid any spoilers, but this has to be yet another great Disney hit of finding a way to embrace strong characters and bring them forward in an entirely relatable experience, with no clearly defined 'baddies', not only would I encourage people to see this, I would forcibly make them sit down and watch (and have done :) )I am aware if the inevitable wrath incurred in taking existing ordinary/ Demi-god and population for a story, but truly believe that where Disney has pandered to the audience it still made every character we encountered both complex and deep without being overwhelming.Long and short of it, what a hit!!!

",-0.296,0.8355,2019-03-09 00:00:00,9,"This would have been a Ten but I have just one part of this film that I really don't like.But let's start with he positives this film is one of my favourites as it has everything you need from a Disney film funny and interesting characters raw emotion an amazing story and some brilliant songs that stay in you head for days.We have watched this film so many times I've lost count.But I'm sorry about this but I'm not a fan of the scene with Tamatoa and his song Shiny as it's very disconnected to all of the other songs within the film.The scene could have been way better and more adventurous as they had gone to the realm of monsters which clearly could have been explored a lot more.
If they had explored more of the realm of monsters they could have added so many more battles and obstacles for Moana and Maui to defeat and then the moment where Maui finally gets his fish hook back would have felt like more of an achievement as a posed to what actually happens with Tamatoa singing a quite frankly forgettable and out of place song, getting distracted by himself and due to unfounded vanity he poses a very little threat and Maui retrieves his hook with minimal to no effort."
" Another visually stunning Disney film with your standard Disney plot.
",0.3818,0.9916,2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Let's get one thing straight: computers are incredible. Each successive year that passes, I find my eyes blown away at the amazing capabilities of computers to create the kind of imagery found in movies like this. From hair and water effects to some of the more supernatural aspects, the visuals of this film are quite commendable. Sure, Zootopia (2016) looked good too, but since its characters weren't human or in a ""human"" environment, it was difficult to see just how amazing the visuals could be. But this was likely due to Zootopia having more focus on an interesting plot instead of stunning effects.I am impressed that Disney has taken the leap to another non-white ""princess"" with Moana, but much of the cliche trappings of this type of film are out in full force. If I were to tell you Disney made a coming-of-age movie featuring the main character with an animal sidekick, a mute anthropomorphized assistant, and a magical, shape-shifting partner, you'd likely think I had just described Alladin (1992). Alternatively, if I informed you that Disney made a film set in the Pacific Ocean, you'd tell me it was Lilo & Stitch (2002).Consequently, Moana holds faithfully to the Disney formula, despite not having a romantic side-plot (a la Mulan (1998)). Maybe these are just side effects of having non-white characters, but this also helped give it a unique cultural backdrop which was propelled along by its catchy and singable songs. If anything, perhaps it is due to our society embracing the role of independent female leaders. Sure, the main character had the help of a demi-god, but she ended up doing most of the ""heavy lifting"" of carrying the plot herself. She didn't need a man to accomplish her mission or achieve her dreams.Another visually stunning Disney film with your standard Disney plot, I give Moana 4.0 stars out of 5."

So many people gave Moana such wonderful reviews, but I don't understand why. I just don't see how this movie can compare to other Disney movies of its kind. Take Mulan for example--it is one of the best Disney movies of all time. Mulan contains all of the same elements as Moana (hero's journey, animal sidekick, enemy, etc.), Mulan just presents them in a way that is so much more likable to the average human being. I'm not saying that Moana is poorly executed--although it very well could be--I'm just saying that it wasn't a quality movie like Mulan was. Additionally, I found Moana to be boring at times; the plot just seemed to drag on and on. There was so much sailing!"

Uhmm.....uhm.....Since the success of 'Frozen', there's a desire to make every animated film a musical, or at least with a few musical numbers. Unfortunately this film offers noting new and the singing is more annoying than entertaining. This film feels like it is trying to be 'Frozen', 'The Lion King', 'The Croods', 'Tangled', 'Minions' and 'Tinker Bell' (and several other animated films) all in one. The characters, however, are very bland and the plot as thin as the icing layer on a cake.There is nothing special about Moana and none of the other characters are even remotely interesting. The film lacks depth and the animation lacks detail. This is a forgettable film I'll conveniently forget I've ever watched.

Children don't understand nor do they want to watch a complex film. Have these people never watched CBeebies?! All Disney films are formulaic and it works for their core audience.My son loves this film. As does the rest of them family. It's uplifting, beautiful visually and teaches children a host of lessons about being true to yourself, that who you are is what you do, how wronged people can react in a manner out of character, that good people do bad things in order to be liked...it also dipects a confident, independent and brave child. All topics that sparked conversations around what these mean with my 6 year old step daughter who thought your name is who you are.I do agree that Disney does have a tendency lately to have a female hero, I would like to see a modern Disney film with a male lead, but that doesn't directly take anything away from this film."

I actually think it mighr be my second favoute disney film, behind hercules. Moana as a character is possibly my favoute female, disney character. She is so cool, fun to watch and just a strong young woman. I love the other characters, especially that chicken. I absolutely love the plot. The only thing that bothered me was the one song called 'Shiny', which i founs kinda weird and awkward. I also found the song badly paces.

",0.6249,0.9852,2018-10-23 00:00:00,6,"Another film I watched while with my fiance that she picked out to watch. It was not bad and had its interesting moments and it was really nice to look at, but how many more of these messed up plot movies are we going to get? I guess a whole hell of a lot considering you smack Disney on anything and it does spectacular even when we get a story and a world where I cannot tell when things are supposed to be occurring or why things are occurring.The story has a young girl who really wants to go sailing and imagines really peppy songs while her ancestors are shown sailing. There is something about a dude who steals a jewel from an island and has a magic fishhook that allows him to be anything he wants and not sure when this happens. An older woman telling the story suggests that it happened long ago, but Maui whose power is reliant on the fishhook hasn't aged a bit since that happened. He also has tattoos that move and are supposed to be funny, but they generally miss the mark. He joins the main character Moana to return the jewel to the island and meet all sorts of strange things that are never really explained thoroughly.The film looks good and there are some funny moments and even a few catchy songs, but the story is so weak. Another in a long line of girls can do everything a guy can and be the hero, of course, in real life testosterone plays a factor and guys generally are stronger so that is why up to political correctness time men were the main protagonist in stories. Sorry, but no matter what you do, can't change biology. The demigod, Maui, of course is a lumbering oaf who does more hindering than helping, but at least he wasn't the bad guy, well I guess he sort of was...So, a very pretty film to look at, you get a few catchy tunes, but you also get the same thing we have seen in quite a few Disney films lately. Female protagonist, doofus male sidekick and a twist at the end you will see for miles before it is revealed. I'm glad Marvel has some control over its section and is hands on with the material, I do believe it is the only thing keeping those movies really good."
" Review of Moana
",0.0,0.9977,2018-10-15 00:00:00,10,"Moana is a modern-day Disney. This story is slightly different then the traditional Disney stories because it focuses the story of a girl trying to save her people rather than trying to find a man. This movie is G-rated and family fun for all. Disney has the ability to create movies that are meant for children but include some adult jokes that will go over the young people's heads for the parents to enjoy. The movie includes a catchy sound track that have topped the billboard charts. The story begins with young Moana who shows a strong interest in the sea and in sailing out past the reef. Young Moana's dreams are looked down upon by her father who was the leader of the village. Moana will one day become the leader of the village however she sees something on the outside that will draw Moana to make a risky move to save her village. Long ago in a time where there were few people on the earth, the gods created a man into a demi-god. His name was Maui. Maui brought and help full things to the people around him however his self-loving personality caused Maui to make a drastic choice to steal the heart of Te Fiti. By stealing the heart is cause a slight change of the earth and its blessings to the people. After Maui took the heart he was attacked by a volcano god named Te Ka who caused the heart to be lost deep into the ocean, Maui hook to gain a slight crack and Maui to be sent away for a couple for years without human interaction. The story moves on to discuss Moana's adventures and her interactions with Maui. The movie tells the story of a young girl who completes a brave act in order to save her people. This is not a traditional story because there is no love interest throughout the film. Over all the best part of the movie would be the musical sound track. The songs in the movie do a great job a helping to aid the plot and move the story line along. Not only are the songs catching and fun they also are used as a benefit to the story tellers. The overall atmosphere of the movie was light and airy. I would recommend this move to people of all ages and backgrounds due to the message it share and the way it is delivered."

" Okay, if anybody doesn't like this film, they have no idea what they're talking about
",-0.3421,0.9897,2018-08-22 00:00:00,8,"Seriously, I saw a lot of less-than-5 star reviews on the first page of the review page. It seems that there are a lot of people that just want to try to bring the rating down because they can't stand it when a movie they hate gets all the love in the world. In the case of Moana, do not listen to said people.This is a beautiful movie and does deserve the moniker of ""Disney Classic."" It has just about all the elements of a Disney Classic: Great animation, great songs, great voice performances and a payoff that is well worth the journey.The story is about a young Polynesian girl named Moana who is the princess (again, Disney) of her island. However, where she really longs to be is on the water, even though she has been told not to go out there. However, when things start looking bleak for her island, the only thing to do is to cross the Ocean, find Maui, a demigod who stole the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, and return the heart.While there are many aspects of Disney in this movie, there are also some freshness in the movie. First off, the Polynesian feeling of it all; Disney has never had a movie in which these people were the stars, and yet here they are, and I love every minute of it. Secondly, while Moana is a princess, she is not a damsel in distress like most Disney princesses. She never gets kidnapped and is a hardworking girl who would rather get her hands dirty (or, in this case, her feet wet) than wait for a man to sweep her off her feet. All of this is very refreshing to see in a Disney film.So yes, definitely see this movie! Do not worry about the trolls that are trying to bring the rating down; this is a Disney Masterpiece, and anybody who says otherwise is only fooling themselves!Oh, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson can sing! What's not to love?!"
" Disney really masters computeranimation with this one, but that's about it.
",0.0,0.9692,2018-08-22 00:00:00,7,"To start off with my highest praise for Moana: The visuals are spectacular. The water effects are masterfully crafted and the moving tattoos on the body of Maui are entertaining in their liveliness. The climax is also something I hadn't seen coming, and I say that, because out of everything in the movie THAT was the one thing I really didn't predict. Seriously, if you know the Disney movies you'll be able to predict almost every turn.The sidekick of Maui is pretty entertaining, but that blasted Hei-Hei is pretty much pointless and annoying through out the movie. How Far I'll Go was beautiful and You're Welcome was also memorable. The whole soundtrack captured the culture of the Polynesian people very well, but the overall film was kind of a disappointment and to be honest I fell asleep during the first watch."

" The Cliche Disney Formula Still Works - Why Amend It?
",0.0,0.9966,2018-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Moana is a traditional Disney animated film. It has everything you'd expect from the studio that has become synonymous with beautiful animation design, generic heroic tales and silly animal sidekicks. It seems at this point, each new Disney animated film is a new skin for the same story. But I cannot bring myself to dislike it. The movie is just so fun that it's impossible to critique the generic storyline and forced plot points. There is literally a wave of water that stops anything interesting or unexpected from happening within the diegesis which is a cool way of saying ""don't expect any surprises"". The thing about Moana is, that despite the barebones story, it's surface is incredibly detailed. It made me immersed in the culture of the island and interested in what life in this society would be like. The little details like drawings and patterns in background shots, to parts of songs being sung in a different language were necessary to making the film distinguishable from something that took less effort to make. This careful planning and attention to detail is something that Disney tend to find success in.The film is also beautiful. The visuals are stunning. The animators did a fantastic job. The score is so fun, though the way music was handled within the film I felt was a little odd. The pacing seemed strange, with many songs appearing in the first act, and then long periods of time between musical interludes in the second and third. Being one of the most appealing parts of the film, I was saddened by this, however, it did make the opening half hour of the film one of the more enjoyable I have seen in recent memory.All in all, Moana is a very fun movie. I can see how adults and kids alike could find enjoyment in it. The voice acting all seemed spot on, and I was pleasantly surprised by how well Dwayne Johnson can sing. Boy, that man really can just do it all can't he. I thoroughly enjoyed Moana, but it is held back in my 7/10 rating due to a slight fatigue in the Disney animated storytelling. I'd like to think that it would get a higher rating from me if I was to focus on it individually and forget the other similar Disney films I have seen; but I'm afraid I cannot. It was a very fun movie, but nothing to tell the grandkids about."

Step 3. Make middle part with more singing and adding characters (good and bad) (also esablish main threat) while main character goes to some places.
Step 4. Add a sad or losing part for the main character.

The animation looked really nice, I liked the protagonist and Maui, music was pretty enjoyable to listen to (The Rock's song was my favorite, crab guy a close second). It did have some deeper and timeless themes, but it only slightly touched on them. The lack of depth and rather bare and inconsequential story is why I'm giving this only a 6 instead of something higher (for example I think The Croods did a much better job tackling tradition vs the future and exploring a new world. It was also much funnier). So as far as adults and animated movies go, this isn't one of the best and it doesn't offer much, although it is still enjoyable. I'm sure the kids will love it, so definitely set an evening aside and watch it with them if you have any!6/10

-Likeable characters
-New take on accompanying animal/entity
-Nice animation
-Nice musicCons:

It's decent for me but anyone who likes Pacific Island motifs would find it fun. Dwayne Johnson was the best part as the demigod. A lot of my friends can't stand him because he's a former wrestler but that seems like such an unfair judgment and an utterly ridiculous reason to dislike a celebrity. He's made some decent movies, so what's not to like? I enjoyed him in the Scorpion King. Anyway, back to Moana. I enjoyed the themes that went into the movie, especially the Pacific Island motifs, Moana's mission, and the clash between spirits, humans, and demigods. It's almost like Avatar: The Last Airbender that way. Oh, but to put it honestly, it's not my absolute favorite Disney film, but the visuals were stunning.

Story was meh, the crab scene was more bizarre than scenes from Alice in wonderland. That being said I don't think these characters are anything that stand out in the Disney world. The effects and scenery saved what it could of this movie. I rank it high for the detail added to the tattoos of the characters. As a man covered in them, I appreciate the detail to the customs their tattoos stand for. Otherwise, try again Disney."

" Sets the bar for animated movies higher
",0.0,0.9997,2018-05-30 00:00:00,8,"The main reason I saw this movie is because Alessia Cara sings one of the songs. Sure, she sings it during the end credits and the same song is sung by Auli'i Cravalho during the movie, but that's the main reason I wanted to see this movie. I admire Alessia Cara, check out her songs, she's great! I also listened to some of the other songs from this movie on YouTube and I really liked them, so today I sat down and finally saw ""Moana"".I loved this movie from the beginning. The opening scene where we're told the mythological history of the island is beautiful. Little moments like Moana's scene with the baby sea turtle make her character even more adorable. Little moments like the adult sea turtle swimming next to Moana in the water, the chicken tripping and walking into the fire, the pig and more are beautiful as well and they add so much to the movie.The animation is gorgeous. Even though I didn't see it in 3D (but I would like to some day), at times you just wanted to grab into the screen. Everything in this movie looks so pretty. I saw this movie in full HD which was perfect. You could feel every single leaf of the flowers and trees and every single hair of the characters and the lighting they integrated into the animation is really nice.The soundtrack for this movie is amazing. I really like the Polynesian score, but what's really special are the songs sung by the characters, especially ""How Far I'll Go"". I might actually buy the soundtrack soon. What I don't like about lots of modern musical movies is that the lyrics are mostly irrelevant to the story, but here they are part of the story and they are meaningful.The story is great, interesting and continuously unpredictable, this movie has realistic characters, I cared about all of the main characters and I was invested in Moana's journey and the fact that she's clumsy (like me) makes her more interesting and relatable. Maui and the chicken are great comic relief while Maui is also a very serious character. This movie has a great screenplay. There's great funny and light-hearted scenes contrasting with emotional, sad, meaningful and tense scenes and the transitions don't feel abrupt. I also liked that this movie poked fun at the fact that people use ""men"" as a gender-neutral word for ""humans"" in one scene. The dream sequence isn't fooling us either which is a rarity these days. Another thing this movie does well is using slow motion with a purpose, there's a beautiful slow motion sequence towards the end.Another thing that I really liked about this movie is that the location is not irrelevant. The culture of the island is distinctly Polynesian and I love to see that culture being portrayed on the big screen.The voice acting is great, particularly Auli'i Cravalho is doing a great job, especially considering that this was her movie debut. I like that they cast voice actresses and actors that match what you think the characters would sound like.This movie also has a great message about people not being what they seem like on first sight, but actually being really beautiful inside even though you might not see it at first, it has a great message about believing in yourself and it has a great message about forgiving.I have a few flaws with this movie on first viewing, mostly little things that don't make sense but don't really have an impact on the story, like some gimmicks in the animation that don't make sense if you think about them, but they're pretty little moments which enhance the movie in the long run. Also, it's unlikely that Moana is doing that well escaping the pirates' arrows. And Moana has no access to food and water while she's off the island, yet she's never shown to be hungry or thirsty. I think the movie started off really good, but I thought the monster character who appeared an hour into the movie was really boring. Fortunately it's only in the movie for a few minutes. In the long run, ""Moana"" is a great movie with flaws. The second act was good, the first act was great and the third act was just beautiful. It was a little boring towards the middle, but the middle part that I didn't like is so short that I'm not going to downgrade it because of that and I give it a 10/10. I hardly ever felt that invested in the characters, emotional and at times even tense in an animated movie. This definitely sets my bar for my ratings of animated movies higher."
" A Typical Disney Film, Fun but Predictable
",0.2846,0.9852,2018-05-23 00:00:00,6,"""Moana"" is a different take on Disney in terms of setting and characters, but the same story is told that we have seen countless times.-Analysis of Notable Work- Writing/Directing: When a kid's film is made there is not an abundance of thought put into the story. They can be recycled over and over again because it is a system that continues to work on kids and families. But once again we have a story of a young hero/heroine who goes on an adventure but runs into a few problems. Then they meet someone who can help them. They end up helping each other and that bad guy gets defeated (or in this case was apparently never a bad guy). As a wise man-turned-clock once said, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Directors Ron Clements and John Musker did average work on this film. They carried forward the same story but added their own unique elements. *Cinematography/Editing: The cinematography in this film is above par when it comes to Disney films. It had a realistic quality and was very beautiful. There were some nice moments of blended animations. The editing in the film is about average for a Disney film. It does not draw attention to itself. Most transitions are smooth and keep the story moving. *Dialogue/Acting: Typical writing when it comes to dialogue. Characters revealing exposition and things that are wrong with the world. Moments of self-doubt. Then there is the ""you can be anything you put your heart to"" moment. Nothing out of the ordinary. The actors do enough to carry the story and probably suck young viewers in, but for adults it is over the top at times. *Music/Sound: The music is fun and catchy as in all Disney films. At times it seems like the music is more important than the story. Some songs tell more of a story than the rest of the film does. It is also during songs that 90 percent of problems are resolved. The sound is nothing special. It is realistic enough and yet fantastical enough to feel like a Disney film. *Production Design/Special Effects: The animated world is beautiful and new. The characters look unique compared to other Disney films. It is definitely refreshing. The visuals are powerful. A few sequences with Maui are especially interesting with a blend of different types of animation.*Conclusion: ""Moana"" is an entertaining film, but it delivers nothing new in the Disney realm except for characters and setting. The film is geared towards children, and for that reason it can be pretentious at many times. The motto again seems to be: ""When things start going bad, sing a song and it will all work out."""
" A cute cartoon
",0.4588,-0.8562,2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"It was a very colorful and well written Disney cartoon. I'll admit that I didn't find the songs very memorable, but it dealt with restoring a curse made by a demigod named Maui and how the daughter of a family sets out to stop the curse."
" Solid
",0.1531,0.9964,2018-05-16 00:00:00,9,"The sea has called to Moana since she was small but Chief Tui, her father, has banned the tribe from venturing beyond the reef. When the coconuts rot and the fish disappear, Moana follows her destiny by going to sea in search of trickster demi-god Maui. She seeks to make him rectify a misguided act many years ago, which led to the current problems.This film dazzled me from start to finish, starting with Moana. Enchanting as a child, and engaging as a curious, wilful, and downright feisty teen, the character features great visual design and wonderful voice work from Hawai'ian teen Auli'i Cravalho. Demi-god Maui is also a visual treat, especially the tattoos which offer their own commentary on his actions. And it is a delight to hear Dwayne Johnson taking such pleasure in voicing a character which pays homage to his own Polynesian heritage.The story, while not holding any great surprises, has an unusual setting and is a satisfying tale - the set-up in Act 1 is interesting, the action in Act 2 works well, and the pay-off in Act 3 is both gripping and emotional.The overall design and animation are simply breathtaking. The land locations are vibrant and detailed, the oceanic locations are epic, and the animation, particularly of hair, water and lava, had me open-mouthed with wonder at how beautiful the film is (the 3D has some great moments but shouldn't be considered essential). And there are a handful of points in the movie when story, emotion, and visual delivery come together and grip your throat and bring tears to your eyes.It's not perfect. The comedy pig thankfully doesn't go on the voyage with Moana but, regrettably, the comedy rooster does. Neither is essential, and the film would have been better without them. But it's Disney so, hey, comedy animals.And the songs are not necessary either. They are pretty enough, but the melodies are a little shapeless so there is no immediate show-stopper. But they are well staged and I suspect they will grow on me with repeat viewings. And there will be many of those, because I loved this film!"

" Pretty much a pacific Islander version of Brave
",0.765,0.8952,2018-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Pretty much a pacific Islander version of Brave, only you replace the Celt with an Islander, the crazy killer grizzly with a volcano creature, the crazy witch with a crazy grandmother, and the 'overbearing'(ha ha) mother/oddball father with an overbearing father/demi-God. But, hey at least they got their basic Neo-Disney formula down(I'll give you a hint it rhymes with 'human-empowerment'). However I do find that the pig on the cover is a bit 'misleading due to the girl's grandmother having more of a role in this movie than that scared little piggy(I think they were trying to lambast the 'cute' Disney companion stereotype and just went with the chicken, but then again they did the same thing in Mulan and the 'little brother' character). But all criticism aside, this movie is viewable and relatable on almost all fronts, which makes it a great reviewable movie. Maui makes it a breath of fresh air due to his misogyny, which tends to be rejected in MOST Disney movies rather than embraced (Yeah he get's dropped down a few pegs, but hearing Moana call him a 'son of a-' makes you get the idea). Another good point is that it reaffirms a message of 'equality' vs superiority, given that Moana and Maui both contribute in the restoration of the heart(unlike Maleficent, which makes men look like total daughter kidnapping, wing-stealing, power hungry douchebags). The last point I'll make is that the movie 'empowered' women without 'overpowering' them, which is a faddish archetype seen in MANY titles that seldom makes the movie lose its charm(basically it makes us forget that the main character is a girl and portrays her just like a dude, IE Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman and Alice in the 'New' Alice in wonderland series) a feature easily found in Mulan where they literally portrayed every male stereotype possible; good or bad (Don't get me wrong it was still funny as hell). It also avoided the hammer to the face REAL LIFE politically driven subject matter which can be seen in Zootopia(another recent Disney title, which I still enjoyed)... well unless you look at the fact that Maui was basically aborted by his parents as seen in his backstory.But all in all Moana made me laugh and my wife and kids enjoyed it(even if it is 'just another Disney movie')."

" An Animated Feast For Your Eyes
",0.0,0.9904,2018-03-31 00:00:00,7,"If I could write a review solely based on Moana's animation, it would be 20-pages long, and the movie would score a 10 out of 10. I cannot emphasize how beautiful this movie is. The textures, the colors, the movement, and the design of Moana are just breathtaking. This is the type of opulent 3-D animation that makes you wonder why Disney still owns Pixar if their animation studio is pumping out quality like this. This is Technicolor for the digital age, and it is glorious. Moana follows the timeless Disney tradition of young girls finding their identity through a journey of self-discovery only to see that home is where their heart lies. One would think this trope would wear thin, but not with Disney movies. Disney's willingness to explore different cultures, their timely use of humor, and a cinematic storytelling style that is pure Disney magic, keeps things fresh and enlightening. And no, I don't work for the House of Mouse, but I'm definitely a fan. This time, Disney ventures into the Ancient Polynesian culture to tell the story of a young princess named Moana's (newcomer Auli'I Cravalho) who is desperate to save her people from a food shortage. But to do this, she must venture out beyond the barrier reef, against her father's wishes. A near death experience for Moana almost convinces her that her father is right to avoid traversing the ocean, but Moana's sage-like grandmother gives her departing words of wisdom that is all she needs to find the inspiration to carry on.Armed with no knowledge of sailing, Moana sets out to find the demigod Maui-played infectiously by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, because he is believed to be the only one who can help save their island. And Moana is a determined young woman who is willing to endure Maui's stubborn, narcissistic and borderline abusive male ego, to achieve her goals at all costs. The story follows them (and a stupid chicken) on a journey across the Pacific Ocean to return a magical pounamu stone that Maui stole from the goddess Te Fiti to give to humanity as a gift for purely selfish reasons. Moana and Maui will spend most of their time sparring before realizing they need one another to complete their mission, but it's the final climatic battle with the lava monster Te Ka that reveals the films biggest secret and showcases an epic cascade of animated artistry.Moana is a fun family film that allows The Rock to showcase that egotistical charm that won him millions and millions of fans as a pro wrestler. And Auli'l is so passionate about her performance that Moana comes off as one of the fiercest yet loveliest Disney princesses since Mulan-one of my favorite Disney films. No disrespect intended to Frozen and Princess and the Frog fans. While the songs in Moana are not as epic in scale as the renaissance era of Disney films in the 90's, the songs are still enjoyable. And Alessia Cara's theme song for the movie-""How Far Will I Go""-is the kind of self-empowerment anthem that will leave you humming the chorus long after the movie ends. While the film drags in a few sections, overall, Moana is a fantastic journey into Polynesian mythology, and it'll leave you wanting to plan a vacation to South Pacific to immerse yourself in this fantastic culture."
" A breath of fresh air in Disney's animated library
",0.3182,0.9874,2018-03-29 00:00:00,9,"Disney goes back to their roots with a heartwarming story about a ""princess"" named Moana of Motunui, as she expressed it several times throughout the film. It's a tale of mysticism and heroism that made me truly feel connected to my inner childhood. 
In the movie, Moana is chosen by the power of the ocean to search for the demigod Maui, voice by Dwayne Johnson, and reunite the heart-relic of a fallen goddess in order restore life in the island.The cast did an amazing job voicing each character and singing all the songs that accompanied the movie in such perfect ways. One of the most astonishing scenes of the film was with the giant treasure-hoarding crab, voiced impeccably by Jemaine Clement. The imagery of the underwater world owned by the crab was simply stunning, at times reminding me of the sub-aquatic terrors of ""Finding Nemo"".""Moana"" is filled with clever bits and pieces, like Maiu's tattoos or the shapeshift end-results of his ability or Heihei the clumsy rooster.The songs written by ""Hamilton"" alumni Lin-Manuel Miranda are the best things I have heard in recent years, with the song ""You're Welcome"" at the very top.""Moana"" established itself as one of the best Disney animated feature films of all time."

" 2016's 'Moana' is worth watching! It's a luau of a movie!
",0.3578,0.9943,2018-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Set on the Polynesian islands of the South Pacific. 2016's 'Moana', explore the expedition of a young woman, Moana (Voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical life-breathing relic with an island goddess, Te Fiti, when it was stolen by the Demigod Maui (Voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson). Without spoiling this fictional movie written and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, too much; though the film heavily influenced by Polynesian's history, myths, & culture, it is not directly based on any specific native tribe like the 1926's documentary film of the same name. Instead, the film takes specific cultural elements from a variety of native Pacific groups and incorporates them into one generalized portrayal of Polynesian culture, in order to make the audience member to identity the story better. Because of that, certain critics has accuse Disney of cultural misappropriation & exploitation, suitable to spur a profitable capitalist enterprise of music, celebrities and merchandise. While, this is somewhat true. I don't think, Disney had much of a choice. They had to avoid setting off cultural taboos. It was lose-lose catch 22 situation. Somebody was bound to get offended, regardless. However, I don't think, this musical is as degrading as certain people make it out to be. It's pretty harmless, compare to other tropical musicals like 1958's 'South Pacific' whom portray its island people as ugly snake oil-sellers, hags who gives give away their really young daughters to military servicemen to screw. If anything, 'Moana' gives a more positive light. Still, some of the characters of the film were drawn, very insensitive. Maui did look like an obese ""half pig half hippo"" man. He did look kinda offensive. Still, much of that blame, come from the Walt Disney Animation Studios animators trying to lighten their load, by replicate the same awkward-looking art style that their 2002's animation film 'Lilo & Stich' was doing, over 14 years ago. Even back then, not a lot of people were fans of the big nose, the huge tights, oddly body structure, and alien-like eyes, type of a drawing for islanders. So, I really don't know, why they try to copy it. I guess, they wanted to focus more on other drawings like the supernatural elements designs. Even with that, those drawings also felt a little too familiar. If anything, the spirits looks like Disney recycling artwork that was previous, used in films like 2000's 'Fantasia 2000' & 2014's 'Lava'. As for animal sidekicks. As much as I love Hei Hei (Voiced by Alan Tudyk) & Pua. They really weren't needed. It did felt, unneeded animation. Despite that, at least, the island CGI background visuals for 'Moana' were breath-taking beautiful. There is no better example of that, then the 'Where you are' & 'We Know the Way', musical sequences. The other visuals like the action sequences, were equally done well. I just wish this Polynesian Prometheus/Odyssey-like fantasy story was told a little better to match the visuals. The action scenes in this film seem a bit force. Plus, it doesn't make much sense. After all, I get that, Moana was chosen by the water spirit; because how much, she cares about aquatic-life, but it doesn't explain, why the supernatural entity couldn't just do the task, itself. Nor does it explain why, the ocean tries to kill Moana with storms, sea-monsters, and lead them into conflicts with sea raiders, in the course of the film. Did the demigod actions make the ocean, bio-polar, as well? Also, what was the point of even having Maui around? He really doesn't do much; besides put Moana in danger. Let's not overlook that Maui also tried to kill Moana by locking her in a cave to die & trying to drown her in the middle of the ocean. Hero!? He's more like the villain. Another thing about the story, is that much of the flashbacks, book-reading and dream cave sequences could had been cut down in editing. All of them, felt a little too much like filler. The movie tends to repeat itself, multiply times; explaining, how Moana's people were, once- island voyagers, before Maui, cause the ocean to become too dangerous; despite the fact, the ocean, somewhat helps them. All the exposition dump come across, tiresome and very jarring. Another thing, that hurts the movie is the fact that the story of a young native princess tries to break free from the strict confines of her society by seeking out, a mysterious stranger in order to save her land, sounds a little too familiar. After all, we seen heroine's adventures like this, before, in half a dozen, Walt Disney Animation Studios films like 1995's 'Pocahontas'. Even acclaim Pixar films like 2012's 'Brave' had these well-worn elements. Don't get me wrong, it's doesn't make 'Moana' into a bad movie, but its presenting nothing, groundbreaking. In the end, this movie in a couple years, might not stand out, as much, as other films from this generation. Despite that, the movie does offer positive messages for younger viewers, about self-discovery and empowerment. And Moana herself is a great role model, demonstrating perseverance, curiosity, and courage, even when face with danger. Cravalho perform her, very well. She is a great singer and has a passable voice. As for Johnson, not so much. His performance was more mediocre, because how dial down, his personality was. However, Johnson does sings one of the catchiest songs in the movie, ""You're Welcome""; which is a plus. Besides that song, the funniest song is ""Shiny,"" sung by Jemaine Clement; which also really fun to listen to; along with the power ballad, 'How far I'll go'. All great songs, courtesy of creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. All this music, makes 'Moana' soundtrack, worth listening to. Overall: Although. 'Moana' has many big flaws. It still was entertaining. 'Moana' is truly an adventure worth sailing for. So check it out."
" Great looking and good characters and that's about it
",0.7906,0.9891,2018-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Some time has passed since my viewing of this movie and the first thing that comes to mind, when I think about it, is the scene in which Moana goes to the shoreline of the island where she lives and the first song plays. Watching this scene on a big TV in HD makes your jaw drop, as you are mesmerized by all the pretty colours. As with many recent Pixar animations, the creators go out of their way to make everything as colourful as possible, to the point that certain neon-lit magical creatures and scenes feel like they were created solely for the purpose of allowing creators the freedom of using extreme colours that you would not otherwise encounter in a realistic setting. This is not a complaint, at least not on its own. The net result is that the movie does look gorgeous. However, this observation takes the shape of a minor complaint when you take into account just how standard the other aspects of the movie are. At that point, the excessive visuals and style start looking more like a set of jingling keys, distracting the viewer from the fact that the rest of the movie is just ok.Moana has interesting characters, with Moana herself not being one of them. The demigod Maui's dominating arrogance is a refreshing trait for a main character, his animating tattoos are funny (although this again is more of a visual aspect rather than a character trait), his backstory is interesting and his arch is subtle. The giant crab is fun, even though he is not on screen for long. The acting and dialogue are good, though not groundbreaking.However, the plot is just a rehash of the same old story: a young character feels the drive to cross a boundary, set by his or her guardians. The young character then disobeys and gets in trouble, but ultimately overcomes, learning about self in the process and usually learning to be more responsible. There is an interesting little twist at the end, which puts Maui's character in an even more interesting light but that's about it.Moana has no major flaws and it's a pleasant watch from beginning to end, but I do contest the apparent tendency of some people to treat this movie as a God that needs to be worshiped."
" Moana is yet another Disney classic to add to their massive catalogue of visually stunning animations.
",0.3818,0.997,2018-02-27 00:00:00,9,"God mother flipping dammit Disney did it again. I was so ready to be saying how overrated this film is...and yet I succumbed to the charm, the beauty and the magical world that is Moana. The daughter of a tribal chief, Moana is chosen (by the sea might I add) to save the world by undoing what Demi God Maui did...ripping the heart out of an Island Goddess that sounds extremely similar to Nefertiti. In doing so, he has caused the world to fall into darkness and for monsters to roam wild beyond the reef. Moana and Maui must put their differences aside and work together. Standard Disney formula is standard, but who even cares when it works so well! Even for the 55th animated feature! The film is pretty much The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker...and I loved it. Loved loved loved loved lovvvved this flick. A ridiculous amount of memorable characters, from a demented rooster named Hei Hei (who provides the majority of laughs) to an army of crazy coconut pirates that felt very reminiscent to Mad Max: Fury Road. The animation was absolutely stunning and there is a slow motion scene towards the end where Moana walks through the water and I simply stood up and shouted ""YES! MOANA YOU EPIC BEAST!"". The lore was extremely thick with traditional Hawaiian culture which I would've liked to have seen more exploration into as it is a fascinating culture. Plenty of morals for the younger audiences like teamwork, determination and how to shape shift into various creatures (obviously...). The voice acting was perfect, took me awhile to adjust to The Rock but I came around and actually thought he was well cast. The big question is: what are the songs like? Damn. Flipping. Catchy. ""No one knowsssss how far I'll goooooo"" or a super weird glittering crab singing ""Shiningggg!"" (which is the weakest song).

A pounamu stone is her heart and the source of her powers. Maui, a shape-shifting demigod steals it but he subsequently loses his powers. A millennium later, Moana the daughter of Motunui's chief is the chosen one to get back the heart to Te Fiti as the island is dying. She needs to persuade vain Maui to return the heart.Maybe if I sat with an audience of younger kids I might had enjoyed this film more. As it is I found the film dull, the songs duller. I did not find it that amusing or entertaining.I noted the amount of people involved in writing the story for this film, I think any old hack in Hollywood could had knocked this out on autopilot.I did like the animation style, some of it was very creative but the Polynesian setting bought little to the table."

None.Entertaining, brings the pacific people's mythology and legends known to the entire world, Dwayne Johnson and Auli'i Cravalho are an excellent pair in this animation movie.Speaking of animations, the motion capture and the movements of each character, especially Moana, is simply awesome. I truly appreciate the hard work that was put into making the characters move. It must have been hard work, especially with Moana's hair. I know hair and water are part of the hardest things to produce in computer graphics.Thumbs up!I see some trolls in the reviews, I wonder if they are paid to bring down movies? hehe! Because this one is more than excellent.Frozen was a drama with lots of good songs, Moana is an adventure movie with a few songs that are all entertaining and beautiful.A small gem that should be really appreciated by the kids... also those who would have liked to see Maui and his story on the big screen but without the super special effects and with a very poor script like the one from Clash of the Titans (2010) for example.A must see for all kids and yound at heart. :)"

As for the ears, they are well served too by catchy, idiomatic, singalong numbers and witty, funny dialogue not scared to run a little risqu√© to get a laugh.The story, of Disney necessity, touches on the tried and true, a young independent ""princess"", yearning for change and adventure, surmounting seemingly insurmountable odds on a quest to save the day, accompanied of course by a wise-cracking companion and just to top things off, a cute, dumb pet.The songs even if they seem like they've fallen off the same wagon as those in ""Frozen"" are nonetheless mostly pleasant and memorable and are well sung by the cast, even Dwayne Johnston. My main carp would be the use of derivative minion-lite coconut pirates Moana and Maui encounter on their journey but otherwise I found myself frequently caught up by the duo's escapades and interaction arriving at a big happy ever after climax which outdid the rest of the SFX in the process.Lovely film, first class family entertainment."
" Great looking and sounding ocean adventure
",0.7506,0.9932,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Moana' is a near-flawless family film from Disney. It's got pretty much everything: comedy (mostly from a chicken!), pathos, a good journey with some adversity to overcome, some self-discovery, a great sidekick, some songs, the death of a loved one (the Grandma (House)) and heaps of great animation/scenery.The Chief (Morrison/Jango Fett), doesn't want Moana (Cravalho) to leave their Pacific island, for fear of the big ocean, but she has to follow her destiny and find Maui (Johnson) to restore the heart of Te Fiti and restore balance to the islands. Maui obviously starts out as a bit of a jerk, but he endears himself to us with his well-meaning ways and hilarious moving-tattoos. The lava monster's cool, but not too scary - definitely OK for kids over 3.It's great to see/hear Polynesian actors, songs (particularly the tribal drums) and ancestral art/tattoos. There's a great voice cast - the Grandma is touching - and Clement (Flight of the Conchords) is hilarious as the giant/evil crab. However, it's Moana's film and she's charismatic, feisty and respectful, depending on the situation (helps that they chose a 14-year-old Hawaiian to play her!). She probably sings a few too many songs for me (think there's about seven in the film), and they definitely could've done without The Rock's song! It all ends happily, with her people voyaging again."
" Animation at its best! Now Officially one of my Favorite Movies!
",0.8309,0.9905,2017-12-29 00:00:00,10,"As an individual double majoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing (with a focus on screenplays) I have to say that Moana was one of the best Disney Movies that I have ever watched! In fact, I was astonished by its storyline along with its animations that it became one of my favorite movies and ended up buying my own Moana doll for Christmas!SPOILERS: In particular, I truly enjoyed the scenes where Moana gained the confidence to go out there and voyage into the sea even though her dad Tui wanted her to focus on being the chief for her people. The first time she went out didn't end so well (I was laughing so hard when Moana's Grandma said that whatever she did that she blamed in on the pig, Pua, which in fact, is one of the most adorable characters that Disney has ever created!), but I admire the confidence that she showed. This confidence showed me that we as individuals are truly individuals. I also loved the scene where Maui was trying to turn into the Hawk when he and Moana were trying to get the hook from Tamatoa's shell. It was hilarious to see him turn from a fish, to a shark, then a chameleon etc, then finally back to his human form. It made it even funnier when Tamatoa was saying that Maui was having trouble with his look as he was singing ""Shiny.""All and all, I can't think of anything wrong with this movie. This is one of the Disney Movies that I can watch over and over again!"

There definitely is some flaws, most obvious to me is how they simplify some of the troubles the main characters face, but it's genuinely a good movie.

The music is super catchy and fun, and all the characters memorable. Some parts are just beautiful to watch, and the plot twist is one of the best handled I've seen in ANY movie, animated or not.

" Let the girls be Moana... and the boys be moaning...
",0.0,0.9958,2017-12-22 00:00:00,7,"And Now For Something... Completely... Identical! ""Moana"" is a dazzling-looking story but to put it simply, it's not very interesting. The film is so obedient to all the recent trends that have defined Disney's movies that you can't find one little parcel of originality, it's basically ""The Little Mermaid"" story retold in ""Lilo and Stitch"" setting with a ""Pocahontas""-like character who's the same age than ""Brave"" and driven by a ""Frozen"" narrative. Oahu... Deja-Vu... and when a Hawaiian story leaves you cold, you know there's a problem.To give her deserved credit, Moana is a charming, adorable and strong-minded young preteen girl who has a lot to appeal to, but she's just too typical to strike as a fully developed Disney protagonist even when you try to ignore the trend. Once again, she's royalty, she happens to be the daughter's chief and her dream is to go sailing and discover the other side of the world. Yes, for some reasons later revealed but without being too satisfying, the entire village is stuck on the little island planting coconuts, eating coconuts and singing about how much they love coconuts. No problem, I love coconuts too. But I prefer fish.Some back-story is provided through another ominous legend about a mysterious heart being stolen from the local Goddess allowing a semi-god named Maui to create the human race, the animation was cool and didn't really cut-and-paste something from Disney movies but it still reminded me of ""Kung Fu Panda""... sorry, nothing new again. But even by accepting magic as an obligatory narrative trope in animated movies, I was wondering why is it that most girl-power movies must rely so much on the supernatural. Think about it, whether for Elsa, Moana or even Rey from ""Star Wars"", there's always an element of magic that undermines the idea of a girl or a woman singlehandedly triumphing over the obstacles or despite her weaknesses. Minimizing the help of people or even animal sidekicks, these new trendy heroines most often rely on the assistance of magic, which doesn't really highlight their efforts or their merits. In ""Moana"", the interference of magical waves or reincarnations or any superpowers from Maui are so numerous that the film loses its capability to thrill you, when you get used to these magic ex machina moment, you stop considering any danger a real threat, andthat's a threat for enjoyment.Now, I know the film is another instance of a movie teaching children, but especially girls, that they have to find themselves and have the courage to challenge unfair rules. Fair enough, but how can someone who's the ""chosen one"" ever find herself? Basically, she'll have to find what she was chosen for. By trying to play on every possible safe side, the film never finds its places and ends up delivering more messages than Western Union. And these messages don't necessarily speak the truest statements about life, if you're going to convince children that everything is possible if you put your mind to it, you can't teach them that ""trying"" is the most important thing. How about a Disney movie where 'failure' can be an option? At least, they can try that with a male character if they're afraid of some backlash.To be fair about the movie, I enjoyed the visuals, but we know it's the common denominator of most Disney movies, even ""Finding Dory"" looked great, but the plot was rather thin. What's ""Moana"" got to offer? Sure, I loved the immersion into Hawaiian culture and traditions. It's true Moana succeeds in giving us a Hawaiian flavor from the start but for the most part, the film is an adventure above the sea which isn't the most original setting, and apart from the traditional songs (nothing new since ""The Lion King"") and the colorful look, we could have a movie set inside the island, giving much latitude to the Hawaiian tradition, instead of the usual ""native"" narrative defined in terms of unfair tradition, relationship with Mother Nature and a young daughter who wants to challenge. To be honest, this has become a bit too predictable and the film can only follow the same series of patterns. It becomes all a matter of ""posture"".Dwayne the Rock Johnson and Auli'lCaravalho provide the voices of the heroic pair, and as much as I loved their work, especially some singing moments, I was wondering why the 'Marketing' was so insistent on their background? So Dwayne, a native Samoan dubs the voice of Maui, and Caravalho is a true native. But was Disney afraid of being accused of vocal white-washing? Did Johnson have a Hawaiian accent? And would have accent been accepted or criticized for being too stereotypical? I don't know but I guess it's just to prevent some criticism, and they were certainly right. The film didn't even escape from controversy when they launched the 'Moana' costume. But I guess it shows that no matter how critical we are toward the film, it reacts properly to the mood of its era.Now, I'm looking forward to discovering ""Coco"". Finally a movie about a boy! Sorry, but since Disney is supposed to awaken an inner child, mine happens to be a boy and maybe this girl-power stuff is making the boy inside me feel more insecure or jealous. So I don't mind a girl power movie once in a while but in that case, I wish Disney could... let it go!"
" Disney goes far in 'Moana'
",0.0,0.9957,2017-12-18 00:00:00,7,"Disney Animation Studios has been on a hot streak for a number of years now, and 2016's 'Moana' was another example of how far the studio will go to release films that resonate with its audiences. While we are clearly beyond the days of the classic 2D animated movies that audiences of all ages fell in love with, 'Moana' proves it's possible to capture the magic of this era through quick wit, lots of laughs and, of course, catchy songs.The film follows the story of a young Polynesia princess who's forbidden from leaving her homeland - an island in the South Pacific. As is the case in most Disney pictures, the protagonist, Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), defies convention and embarks on a journey to find a demigod named Maui (Dwayne Johnson) so she can retrieve Te Fiti's heart, an ancient artifact that is needed to restore order to the open seas. This plot is nothing spectacular - it's pretty basic, but is in line with what's needed for a foundation of a great animated film.""Moana''s strengths are obvious. From the beautiful scenery brought to life through animation, where everything in nature appears to be alive - even the inanimate ocean, to the standard comedic moments that are expected in Disney movies (most of which come at the expense of Maui), there is plenty to enjoy about the film. The standout for sure is Cravalho, as her vocals are impressive on the soundtrack, including its biggest hit, ""How Far I'll Go."" As a heroine, Moana is fiercely independent and self-sufficient - a strong role model particularly for young girls. The only areas that feel a bit lacking are the few number of characters - much less compared to traditional Disney movies - and the fact that there is no traditional villain (think Jafar, Cruella de Vil, Scar, etc,). That said, there's plenty of action and adventure to keep audiences engaged.While not the most memorable story, 'Moana' is a fun, free-spirited adventure and is an example of how Disney is continuing to explore new areas while working with a proven formula for success."
" Not the Disney Experience I had Hoped for, but Entertaining Nonetheless,
",0.6858,0.9894,2017-12-18 00:00:00,7,"Moana is a good movie with a well written plot and a terrific vocal cast. It is an entertaining Disney film that boasts plenty of highly enjoyable, as well as catchy, musical numbers that make the movie shine, particularly How Far I'll Go and You're Welcome. The voice cast is also terrific, with Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson really shining in this role, and newcomer Auli'i Cravalho really owning a huge, challenging character. I did feel that the film lacked originality. I did not see anything here that I have not already seen in other Disney princess films, it follows the exact same story beats as the other movies, without doing anything extraordinary or unconventional to make up for this. As well as that, the story never truly pulled me in, while films such as Mulan and Tangled really gripped me, there was never a moment where I felt truly engrossed with this plot. I had to really try to watch it rather than being taken away. Reasonable Disney fun. While it is not what I had hoped for, Moana is still certainly an enjoyable 90 minutes that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film. A young Hawaiian must seek out and find a Demigod in order to bring peace to her island."

",0.0129,0.9613,2017-12-17 00:00:00,7,"The qualities of Disney films that most people like are sustained in 'Moana' and generally presented with great skill and wit. Auli'i Cravalho handles her debut role excellently, and Dwayne Johnson makes a much better voice actor than I expected. The setting of 'Moana' is fresh and seems to be arranged with integrity and a genuine interest. My only substantial complaint about this film is that the distribution of songs seems somewhat inconsistent, dominating the first half to the extent that the narrative isn't as easily followed as it should be; the world of 'Moana' is harder to break into than those of 'Frozen' and the other recent, memorable Disney films, and so the directors probably should have taken a little more time to explain it to the audience before we hear half a dozen songs. The good in 'Moana' definitely outweighs the bad, though, and my 7/10 rating *almost* became an 8/10."
" This may actually be too complex for children, but they sure enjoy it!
",0.8197,0.9923,2017-11-20 00:00:00,8,"Moana is the story of a teenage girl living in Oceanic dreamtime who, on the advice of her grandmother, runs away from home, takes up with a strange mostly-naked man, and drops a rock down a volcano.Moana is also the story of a teenage girl living in Oceanic dreamtime who discovers women's power in response to men's fear. A male thief greedily and thoughtlessly steals a token of female power and thus begins the destruction of the world. A young woman, with the support of feminine archetypes, restores the power of creation to the female breast where it belongs.There is no princess, though the heroine is the daughter of a chief. There is no romance; the male lead is a trickster whose self-interest supersedes all. The eerily intelligent animal sidekicks are relegated to the background, and there is even a self-aware joke on how we eat our animal friends.It's a form of the Hero's Journey, of course, but there is also a complex discussion of personal and group identity, responsibility to one's community versus one's responsibility to oneself, and the ethical ramifications of following one's {dreams|heart|goals|responsibilities} through, even when they conflict with the goals or needs of the group or the other. It starts with the heroine being told who she is, and where she is, and where she belongs, that there is no appeal, and there is no other option. Interestingly, as she initially accepts her manufactured identity and role in the community, that very acceptance requires that she reject her community's definition of who she is to go on the Hero's Journey, discover who she *really* is, proclaim it to the world, and take action based on that true identity. She can thus uncover the true needs of both her gods and her community, successfully fulfill those needs, and help them integrate their new true identities with their previous image of Who We Are.This is no boilerplate Disney spectacle; this is a story based on Tahitian and Maori mythology. There is bad; a fair amount of probably accidental racism that could have been avoided with better cultural advisers, and an incorrect presentation of the trickster deity's physical appearance that perpetuates a generally false image of weight and bulk in Oceanic males (though the actual lithe teenage boy appearance from myth would open a whole new can of worms, stuck out in the ocean with the lithe teenage girl as they were). But the good far outweighs the bad, and the voyager sequence alone is worth the price of admission. Plus, the way Maui, Shapeshifter, Demigod of the Wind and Sea, Hero of Men (and Women) screams when he sees that little girl for the first time is pretty funny. And you have to picture Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson doing the ""You're Welcome"" song and dance, because that's also pretty funny. And there are two pee jokes.If you must watch one movie a thousand times because you have children, this is a good one to choose."

Though everyone in the reviews has appreciated the graphics and music most of them have failed to understand the story.Maui has been credited in the movie with raising islands, giving people coconuts, lengthening the duration of day. These events represent the physical phenomena that have taken place during the history of the earth, and the evolution of life too.In one review I read someone complaining that it does not make sense to wait on an island to correct a mistake done 1000 years ago, but the humans have been degrading, contaminating and destructing the land and the oceans for thousands of years and still have not left the island of their limited approach towards the environment.There is a lot that can be said about every little detail depicted in the movie but I wanted to highlight the hidden ideas conveyed through the story, that ""even a chicken plays a vital role in sustaining the life on the earth""."

The other thing which doesn't really go with the whole concept and looks, is one of the main characters as Te Fiti itself. She looks more like a Marvel or DC comic characters not very localized based on story needs when represented as Lava monster. I'll give 10 out of 10 for great characterized of Maui and the grandma.

Pre-columbian and pre-Portuguese, no sextants etc. and indeed a stellar achievement of sailing and navigation. This context somehow is almost completely lost in this lame story, reduced to a fairy tale set in the South Seas without much local atmosphere in terms of narration. Just using an outrigger canoe as major focus in this animation is not enough. Also the soliciting topic of the search of the unknown remains mostly unused in this movie in fact. A wasted opportunity."

A lot of things about the movie bothered me that never did before. I thought there was too much singing, and it became very boring to keep hearing song after song. It wasn't something I was expecting and it put me off of the movie for quite a bit. About a month later, I tried to watch it again to see if after knowing what to expect I would like it better. I did. I was very pleasantry surprised by how much I loved it after that. The songs have become a fixture in my life. I love this movie now. All of the singing threw me off the first time, for not expecting it to be a musical like that. After I knew what it was, the second time was much more enjoyable. I encourage the people that didn't like it the first time, to try it out again."

Even if this isn't one of my favorite movies, it does a great job drawing you into it and letting you have fun for two hours. And it doesn't even feel like two hours since there are so many things that happen. The film really does go on and let it delve into the best potential that it possibly could be able to ever go into. I feel like this is the best that it could have been. Despite Dwayne Johnson not being all that great of a singer obviously, he just gives it his all. And the girl who plays Moana for being only 16 years old at the time does a good job and off to the side, I will admit it is strange to see people younger than me acting and being in these professional careers. But that is just something that I want to say to the side. But I also like a lot of the songs on here since they are just nice and fun, like most of the rest of this movie should have been and exactly was."
" Why do people like this movie so much?
",0.3612,-0.9968,2017-10-28 00:00:00,3,"I DO NOT understand the hype around this movie. With so many good Disney movies out there, even relatively modern ones like Tangled and The Emperors New Groove, I don't understand why anyone would watch this movie. It's utterly predictable and stars a pretentious, spoiled brat of a princess who is incapable of doing anything on her own. Here are my problems with this movie. 1. Moana does absolutely nothing on her own!Whether from Maui the super special Demigod, her dead grandmother in the form of a sparkly spirit sting ray, or the ocean itself, help always seems to come for Moana. She cannot do anything on her own. She can't sail her own boat without the help of the magical ocean or Maui. I'm still not sure why she was chosen in the first place. Aside from a very naive and misguided sense of optimism, she possesses no real positive qualities, and she never would have succeeded without the help of the aforementioned parties. 2. Why is no one talking about the coconuts??Can someone please explain to me why no one is concerned or confused that they are actually attacked by an angry army of sentient coconuts? No explanation. No warning. No sense. Just an army of coconuts that almost manage to vanquish our heroic team, despite the fact that they are so stupid that at one point, one of them actually shoots his own leader with a blow dart. But we shouldn't be surprised. They are, after all, coconuts. And if moana is so incredible, she should have been able to defeat them much easier. Not to mention the fact that this is really just a terrible writing choice for Disney. This whole scene could have been cut out and it wouldn't have changed the movie at all. It wouldn't make a whole lot more sense, but at least you could say that no one was attacked by coconuts. 3. Let's talk about that ending. Disney is not known for flawless endings. But this one made no sense. First of all, you've got a lava monster living in the middle of the ocean, because the laws of chemistry mean nothing to Disney. But then Moana just walks right out and sings it into submission, calming down the volcanic anger of the scary monster with the soothing touch from her pretty princess hand. The idea of the lava monster being the dying island was completely predictable, but they could have come up with a more logical way to return the heart. 4. Why does this disease move so slowly?It's been 1000 years since Maui stole the heart, right? But judging by how quickly the blackness was chasing Maui when he first stole it, it should have reached Moana's island much sooner. 5. Her sidekicks are awful. I'm not going to try to tell you that Flounder and Pascal are the brightest crayons in the box, but this chicken is downright stupid. And it's not even funny. He's trying to eat a rock. Repeatedly. No creature could possibly be that stupid and live longer than 12 seconds. He is absolutely moronic and she should have let Maui eat him. And the pig isn't much better. 6. Her father is quite possibly the worst chief on the planet. He's afraid of the water. He lost his friend. Fine. But his people are literally starving. How can he possibly justify not allowing his fishermen, who are presumably much smarter and more experienced than he was at the time of his tragic accident, to go out and find food for his people? Then he stifles his daughter's creativity and curiosity because of his own fears. He's a terrible father and a terrible chief and he needs to be dethroned. And also, if he's so afraid, how does his daughter know how to swim? All in all, this movie is absolutely atrocious. The writing makes no sense. The plot is lazy and predictable. Moana, though regarded as revolutionary and self reliant, is very much the same as every other princess to ever appear in a Disney movie. The only difference is her very misplaced optimism and utter lack of talent. Oh, and by the way, that crab is creepy. I'm sorry."
" The best movie I ever seen
",0.6369,0.9857,2017-10-23 00:00:00,10,hello! I think Disney is very invested in this movie is one of my favorites. I really liked the idea and this is not an ordinary Princess And the stigma that someone should save Moana. I actually really like the song of Maui is so funny and cute and i think it Must be more films like Moana with a message and also I really like the player Dwayne Johnson so i am really happy that he dubbed this film and really like your article!!!!
" Propped up by beautiful animation
",0.5994,0.8299,2017-10-02 00:00:00,7,"'Moana' is a decent movie, however there are a few flaws that bring it down--chiefly odd pacing and below average songs. In terms of pacing, the character development felt very rushed, often with characters changing over the course of a few seconds after one small event. The development almost felt like an afterthought. The songs, I felt, were not up to Disney's standards, with the exception of ""You're Welcome"" the songs/singing felt kind of stilted, falling just short of expectations. It almost felt as if the producers cut the time spent on developing the songs, as they were thought out well but just missed in execution. I believe if some more time was spent tweaking the songs they would have delivered.However, Moana's most glaring flaws are obscured by it's animation. The movie is visually stunning, especially the water/sea. It is worth watching just for the visuals alone. Honestly, if it weren't for the visuals, I would have given Moana around a 5.5 as the story was a bit lacking, but Disney did such a fantastic job on the animation that I would have no problem giving 'Moana' a 7.5, even if it had been a silent movie."

However, Moana is not a typical 'Disney Princess' film.The plot is interesting and innovative and the characters feel so real that an attachment is immediately forged. Its packed full of comedy and suspense and the musical numbers are an added bonus. The story itself is bursting with culture and knowledge all of which boosts the experience. Its a brilliant film for the whole family and i have found myself in love with it. I would recommend to anyone and everyone!"
" Killed it!
",-0.6996,0.9969,2017-09-28 00:00:00,10,"It was an excellent movie with an excellent soundtrack, it pretty much had an excellent everything. Moana really doesn't disappoint it has a good pacing, an amazing cast, and it is outstanding. that sentence alone could summarise this entire review, but hey that's rather stingy for something I thought was brilliant. Moana is a story that takes place in Ancient Polynesia, when a curse reaches the island Mata Nui a chiefs daughter (Moana) is determined to venture beyond the reef, to find a demigod named Maui in order to stop the curse. Like most Disney movies this is a coming of age story as Moana is being pulled in two separate directions in one she is to become the next Chief of the village however she is struggling to love her people and make them the priority in her life while also being pulled in the direction of her beloved ocean that chose her as a child. Moana is joined by a demigod named Maui. He starts out as a very self loving and humorous character but we quickly learn why and see him change for the better. The classical three-act-structure that is the main convention in every film possibly ever made. Moana has a great beginning, good middle, and a great ending. The cinematography was beautiful it really shows that the creators have done their research as the island was point perfect of every detail, this just creates a whole new experience for the audience as we are not having to imagine what it actually looks like we are able to see exactly what it looks like right in front of us.

" Moana ‚Äì A Good Slice of Disney Cheese
",0.4404,0.9983,2017-09-01 00:00:00,7,"2016 was a busy year for animated films hitting the box office and big screens, with hit movies such as 'Zootopia' and 'Kubo & The Two Strings' being ever prevalent as some of the most popular films to debut that year - It's no surprise to me that 'Moana' followed the same musical legacy that Walt Disney studios like to traditionally strive for.Disney's 'Moana' follows the events after demigod Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) steals the heart of the goddess Te Fiti, plunging the island into a watery abyss. As Muai escapes the sinking island, he is soon confronted by the Lava Monster (Te KƒÅ), a heartless and destructive creature with a fiery disposition. Maui is defeated in battle and sinks further into the depths, becoming but a memory to the humans or a children's bedtime story. With the threat of growing darkness making its way over the Polynesian coast; Moana, a young girl caught in personal conflict between her love of her village she is destined to lead and dreams of sailing the waters beyond the reef, must find the courage to find the lost demigod and restore order to the land. While the film itself lacks the many intricate details that movies such as 'Zootopia' included, Moana is the traditional bit of cheese that gives Walt Disney it's popular family image, with a wide range of musical numbers that provide enjoyment like their previous counterparts. In no way was it shocking that I found myself humming out the tune of ""You're Welcome"" performed by Dwayne Johnson as Lin- Manuel Miranda manages to bring a vibrant culture into a soundtrack that's accessible for all ages. They're easy to listen to, an absolute pleasure to play on repeat and manage to remain relevant to their purpose. The animation is on point throughout the movie, equalling the same amount of intricate programming as the two previous films mentioned ‚Äì all the while keeping the same, alluring charm that Disney continues to nail. One thing that Disney manages to do without fail is their choice in voice actors: Dwayne Johnson seems to completely blend in with Maui's egotistical and fun-loving image, yet still remain comfortable enough with his voice to sing a musical number. Auli'i Carvalho definitely manages to hold her own sense of individuality against the star, giving a strong voice to a very modern and highly driven female character. Moana proves that you are always capable of creating a female character that doesn't depend on the validation of a male counterpart or even a shoehorned romantic sub-plot. It was a highly refreshing character to see after 'Frozen' pushed Disney back to the same outdated representation of naive girls risking everything for love. Overall, Moana did not fail to disappoint me. It's above the expectations of 'Frozen' and more on the level of enjoyment that 'Tangled' provided young girls when it first debuted. For families, it is an adventure of self-discovery and confidence that will definitely bring a smile to your face. Great music, an okay-ish story and an idiotic chicken. Need I say more?"
" Less Than Meets the Eye
",0.0,0.9099,2017-08-31 00:00:00,2,Too many people seem to feel the need to love this movie for all the self-congratulatory ways in which this is supposed to be a politically satisfying Disney outing without noticing that it is one of the dullest Disney outings in a very long time.One notable song and very little genuine humour. Dramatic tension is almost non-existent even by Disney standards since it progresses in pretty much a straight line from beginning to end. A few minutes in and the middle and end of the movie are never in doubt.
" Does not deserve the title: 'Disney Classic'
",0.0,0.9944,2017-08-29 00:00:00,3,"I don't care much if they reproduce the same story. If someone did care, than he would not watch new movies after watching 10 with identical story lines, but this film is far from good and here are the reasons..For example: there is way too much comedy: The jokes were most of the times okay. A lot of them fall flat, but let's say that 70% of the jokes were effective and therefore I mean: 'Comedy without much competition on the rest of the story'. Other kinds of comedy however have little effect or they do not have effect at all. The pirates for example are walking coconut-things. They were just added to be cute I guess(just like that little pig that somehow stays young). The giant crab later on in the film turned out to be a comedian and suddenly he started singing.. yeah, not really a 'demon from the deep' now is he? Maui's tattoo's and the chicken could be fun, if they did not overuse those so badly. All in all the comedy seems to get the main priority instead of story and it won¬¥t stop there... The songs are in general just bad and only ment as fillers, same problem with 'Frozen': bad written, uninspiring and barely plot-related unlike the songs in 'Mulan' or 'The Lion King'(just to give some examples that did it right). In the second half of the film they really got disturbing. The last song in which grandma showed up happen to be the most uninspiring of them all: straight sentences in a song-form. It was also as cringing as ¬¥Shiny¬¥ by the ""demon crab"". Anyway those songs, like pretty much the rest, are totally unnecessary and also indicates what the film's formula is: 'Making it child-friendly by and adding lodes of comedy and songs in order to satisfy as many different audiences as possible'. I get that, but as a result they removed almost any possible thread and tension moments in this film and it just won't work if even the characterization is bad. Maui is definitely the better character, but that is mainly because the comedy suits perfectly on his character; He just loves himself. Moana could be an interesting character, but they really made it hard to make her intriguing as one and that is because she tries too little to help her own people. Instead she is most of the time too busy teasing the demigod and the rest of the time she sings. You would expect that she will go straight to the point, if the survival of her people and the balance of life is at stake here, but no.. It seems that it was just not important enough for her and that is why she drastically fails as a ¬¥Caring character¬¥. However the character development of Maui has also downsides: How did the gods make Maui into a demigod and who are those gods and how did Maui felt when that happened, because he was only a child then and why didn't he abandoned his people after receiving those powers, because he got abandoned as well?! Emotional-involvement takes more than a brief discussion and that is why I also do not care about Maui in the end. There were other things that were too brief, for example when Moana left the village while she sang(mother does not do anything to stop her) or the history that explains why Moana's father got so ¬¥Protective¬¥. This is just like 'Frozen', when the parents die: It offers simply too little to get emotional invested by it, so it does not work. Personally I don¬¥t need much to get invested, but I just want a little more done, than nothing at all.However the worst problem in this film happen to be the very questionable plot. Why does Moana has to search for Maui in the first place, if she can restore the heart of Te Fiti herself, because that will mean that everyone can, so why not the sea, since the sea can transport things(including the heart) right away? Maui even asked himself during the screentime and he does have a point that still hasn't been answered. This makes the entire idea of a 'chosen one' invalidated, because the ocean could solve this problem herself a long time ago, not with Maui's or Moana's help, because the only thing you have to do is take that damn thing to that island and show it to that lava creature! There is no need for a demigod or a chosen one! Apparently the ocean did nothing. Was it because it would have been too easy or did the ocean not know that Te Ka was Te Fiti herself? Surprisingly the ocean was not very helpful at all along the way: Where was the ocean when the storm appeared, or when the pirates showed up, or when Te Ka attacked?! This film would have been better off without the whole concept of having a chosen one and without the sea as a sort of guardian. By the way, why does everyone in the village not hate Maui, he caused the extinction of life, so also their food, so 'hate' must be the natural response of the villagers. Instead they say: 'No, this poor fellow made a mistake, all he needs is to be convinced to put the heart back.' Mayby they thought that even 'hate' was too harmful for younger audiences.In conclusion: Moana is simply a bad movie. The comedy overwhelms the movie like too much salt on your omelet. There is very little character development. But above all the plot is a illogical mess! I must admit that I do love the soundtracks, but it had to be ruined by the uninspiring songs. The visuals are stunning, but I just can't give that too much credit for this film."

She is the daughter of the chief, but doesn't like the title ""princess"" a self poke on Disney whose marketing centers around princess dolls and films. Even though the film is aimed at kids, I had a few good laughs. Auli'i Cravalho is quite the singer."

" Jaw dropping music, surprisingly uplifting, lush animation!
",0.3595,0.9858,2017-08-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie restored my tolerance of the Disney formula. I'm more of a Lynch and Kubrick type. Perhaps I was just at a point in my life where the skeptic in me softened. Yes, that animation of baby Moana is pure emotional blackmail. Yes, there is the rebellion against the patriarchal figure that I get tired of seeing in just about every modern American film. But Moana is undeniable. The music is so uplifting, so different, and one of very few soundtracks to which I can listen and marvel a bit. Unlike other animation films featuring princesses of color, this one didn't feel politically compulsory. It wasn't ""corporate has decided that we need to make a movie with a brown princess to be politically correct"" it was, ""look at these interesting people in this interesting place and see how different yet how beautiful they are and in no way need to be like us""...maybe we don't all need to have skinny noses and bodies with big butts (or whatever the trend is). Visually stunning, emotionally touching in unexpected ways, with each character adding soul, light, or comedic relief as needed. The grandma reminded me of my mom who died last year and this movie gave me a way of explaining her passing to my son in a way that helped him. I will say the pop artists covering the original songs is a bit annoying, but that comes at the credits. I perceive Duane Johnson as a fairly respectable actor now, not just a pretty muscle man who scowls. There is so much about this film to look forward to that has not been done before, nor quite like this. I have seen it at least 3 times."
" A nice addition to Disney's 3D animated film library
",0.4215,0.9943,2017-08-16 00:00:00,8,"Moana is a CGI musical animated film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. Featuring the voices of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Temuera Morrison, and newcomer Auli'i Cravalho, it is a nice addition to Disney's 3D animated film library and a fun journey of self-discovery.On the small Polynesian island of Motunui, Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), the daughter and heir of the island's chief, lives in harmony with her fellow inhabitants. One day, Motunui is struck by a terrible curse brought on by the Demigod Maui (voiced by Dwayne The Rock Johnson), which causes food and vegetation to become scarce. Determined to fix this, Moana departs from the island to search for Maui to help her in accomplishing this task.Despite containing some of the typical Disney tropes and clich√©s, Moana manages to feel fresh and vibrant, thanks in part to its huge heart and likable charm. I particularly enjoyed the nice blend of the Polynesian culture, which includes those of Samoa, Hawaii, and New Zealand. The film is very beautiful to look at and the visuals can be stunning at times. The songs, in particular, ""You're Welcome"", are catchy and compliment the film quite well, and never feel annoying or as if they were written specifically to win awards, unlike a certain song from another Disney film about letting go. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is amusing as Maui and he certainly projects enough of his good-naturedness into the role. However, it is newcomer Auli'i Cravalho who stands out the most, mainly due to how well written her character happens to be.I rate it 8/10"

Whatever, the plot is a dump anyway. I guess that is my biggest issue with the film; a super simplified story that feels like a Naruto filler. So yeah, mehhing up the movie."
" Single-Best Modern Disney Princess Movie
",0.0,0.964,2017-08-12 00:00:00,8,"Moana is a movie reminiscent of the classic Disney formula, yet the masterful manipulation of music, visual, and story render a much more powerful narrative. Imagine a Disney princess story mixed with the musical achievement of Elton John in the Lion King (1994) (in this case Lin-Manuel Miranda) to achieve a film of masterful rendition equal to the likes of a Broadway musical or La La Land (2016).The piece is defined by the music, yet still delivers strongly with its plot. Expecting the typical chemistry of the Disney formula, we get a carefully calculated divergence from the recipe. However, instead of the confused ramblings of Frozen (2014), Moana takes the high road, turning Disney magic combined with the traditional musical style to create a wonderful new addition to the Disney princess catalog. Moana, the character, takes the adventurous personality of Ariel and the cautious courage of Simba. Finally, in the climax, every aspect of the film comes together in a beautiful point of parallelism and self-realization, making Moana an instant classic and the best traditional Disney installment since the turning of the new century.However, the creators fumble by mixing up musical craft with the catchy songs designed for kids. There is but one misplaced song that is merely there to catch the essence of the ""Disney magic"". Additionally, what is a divergence from the traditional formula also adheres too much. Playing on the simple pathos and sympathy found all too often in kids movies and romantic facades, the film utilizes clich√© rather than creativity to create conflict in a pivotal moment, unfortunately, reducing the impact of the plot.Nevertheless, Moana is the single-best modern Disney princess movie, contending with the classics, but falters at moments."

I am just not a fan. You may be.Finally, The Rock should go the way of Adam Sandler and Jeff Goldblum and be considered a straight-to-video no-talent. Frankly, I only watched this because I used to do a girl named Moana at work, but otherwise even my kid thought the film was boring. Disney needs a new shtick because Star Wars is out of ideas and Marvel has already begun to wear down its audience."

Again, it is certainly good and it contains some qualities which I really like and hope are expanded upon but it's just not up to the quality of Zootopia, Wreck it Ralph, Big Hero 6 or - heck - even Frozen, as much as I've grown a distinct distaste for that film. Let me break my disappointment with this film down, step by step.Firstly, the plot. As much as I really like the idea of mocking common Disney tropes, the film still follows them tropes and that makes the 'self aware' statement feel redundant. I'm all up for a new self- aware Disney but commit to change, don't dip your toes in the water. Even after that, the plot is pretty clich√©d and weak. I think calling it a buddy adventure film is a good place to start but it just feels so disjointed and so much of it feels like filler. And I absolutely despise the ending. It is 100% a cop out and they clearly just wanted to rap it up quickly.Character and voice acting. Auli'i Cravalho was good as Moana and she can definitely sing. Moana is a very strong contender for Disney princesses. She is independent, kinda interesting and has a strong will; she is a very solid character and I am happy with her overall arc.I love Dwayne Johnson. He may not be a great actor but he sure is likable and insanely charismatic. He will be king of the world some day but, for the love of God, he cannot sing. He CAN NOT SING! As a voice actor: sure he was passable. As a singer: he is the Antichrist. Anyway, as a character, Mauii was a completely average Disney sidekick. He seems to be imitating(to a certain degree) Robin Williams' iconic genie and I'll say it here and now, he doesn't live up to him.The villains in the movie were very weak. Some people argue that there aren't any but I disagree. The bandit things were certainly enemies(with no explained motivation mind you) and the Fire God was a villain for a short time. Both of these characters were uninteresting and boring.Every Disney princess has a sidekick, yes? Yes. And I will happily say, Moana has possibly one of the worst. Hei Hei is such a useless, pointless joke of a sidekick that I cannot believe he was green-lit. His mere existence is a joke and that is REALLY annoying. Put thought into your sidekicks Disney!The animation was stunning. It looked amazing and I really commend the animation department. We have water effects nearly on par with 'The Good Dinosaur' and really creative and inventive character design and visuals. The cinematography and editing were both pretty good.I laughed at quite a few jokes but nothing on par with Aladdin or whatnot. The emotional payoff with her grandma was very touching and emotional and I am genuinely impressed with how they handled it.As for music, I like the song 'How Far I'll Go' but they use it THREE times and that just makes the song hard to listen to. I hate every other song in the music, especially Johnson's and that god damn crab(screw that crab!).In conclusion, I recommend this movie but I definitely think it is one of the weaker entries to the new Renaissance. You should see it but I wouldn't expect cinematic gold. I'll rate Moana 6 Crab Solos out of 10!"

The animation is pretty, the music is forgettable (with the exception of the rousing Oscar-nominated anthem ""How Far I'll Go""), and the story is moderately engrossing.

The animation is very beautiful, the characters are really likable, the humor is spot-on, the music in it is very enjoyable, the action in it is fantastic. I love this movie so much with a passion. This is easily my all time favorite Disney movie of all time, it's that good. This movie had lived up to a type, in any of it's expectations of being shoddy, this is one of the rarest animated movies that is absolutely flawless. The humor gets better with its considerable charm, some scenes does get sad in some parts, it is considerably one of the best that Disney had ever did. Even the voice-acting is brilliant, they did such a great job with the voice-acting, because it connects their personality of their characters. The plot is very admirable as well, because it focuses on a young Polynesian navigator who wants to become a master wayfinder, and with the help with the once powerful demi- god name Maui, it's up to him and her to stop the lava monster, and save her village. I really hope that it gets a sequel pretty soon because this movie is awesome, and it deserves to get a sequel. If you haven't seen it, go check it out, you'll be in for a real treat. Just, wow was this movie great, this is just amazing. I give this movie a 10/10 for being such a brilliant and perfect movie. Nothing has gotten bad at all, all it is, is just a brilliant Disney movie that the whole family can enjoy with likable characters, admirable animations, pleasing musics, awesome actions, and even some sad scenes that makes you cry."

It's not a wildly different experience like Zootopia, and it's not as subversive to the Disney tropes as Frozen was. It has a lot of the same tropes you see in any Disney movie, and in a lot of ways it's one of the most pure Disney movies, tropes and all, that's come out in a while. It doesn't have a romance which is definitely a refreshing take, but other than that we've definitely seen a lot of this before. But here's the thing, even though it's full of tropes, they're all tropes I love, and it's able to use these tropes in an original environment with characters I really loved.And Moana was a fun animation that set us out on adventures! It brought forth excitement with her never give up attitude. The computer aided animation was great. It is a wonderful children's animation. Good music, great story, and great adventure. It brought life to the Hawaiian mythology and gave me a subject to learn about. Making for another successful animated film by Disney. ----From Yidioo"

""Moana"" is colourful but not very original entry into the Disney 'Princess' franchise (despite the self-referential declination). The sidekick chicken was amusing and, unusual for the genre, not much of a merchandising gimmick. The Rock as Maui was fine as the loud-mouth counterpoint to Moana's typical 'coming of age' girl character but neither of them brought anything new to the canon. Maui's ""Your Welcome"" song (both the music and the imagery) was a standout in an otherwise bland score. The parallels with ""Star Wars (1976) are obvious - all of these types of stories tend to follow the 'hero-myth' trajectory, but this pair is pretty close (a youth who wants to leave, adults resisting, disaster strikes at home, an older mentor who dies and returns as a guiding spirit, a worldly, self-centred companion who flees only to heroically return in the nick of time, a surprise reveal about the nature of the 'enemy'¬Ö). I'll admit that I'm the wrong gender and 50 years too old to be in the target audience for this kind of movie, but I enjoyed it enough to give it a reasonably high rating."

'A God' who depends on his creations, keeps his vital life on open and suddenly turns out to be so evil and bad... To me it really meant a disaster for a story. Then that common scenes, dialogues, even whole parts of a movie were so worn out and boring.Female protagonist, strong and independent young woman, brave and consistent... I liked that. That is something we need today. Someone who will show our kinds, especially girl how much they need to believe in themselves. I liked a hero who was actually a disguised villain. Maui was also a character I liked a lot. Movie made me laugh and that is always respectable by me. And grandma... you are my biggest hero from among them all.I didn't like those musical parts for anything and everything due to which I was almost irritated and annoyed later on.

A Samoan princess is enlisted by the ocean to go on a quest to return things to the way they were. She is forced into acting against her father's wishes, going beyond the limits he has placed on her. Of course, there are no surprises in the plot. We can parse this out without any trouble. The stars of this show are the special effects, the music, and some very interesting characters. But it doesn't offer a lot of new plot developments. If we see enough Disney films, we could line up the characters that seem to appear in just about everyone. Moana is a firecracker, but her endless talk and advice gets a little old. The best characters in the film are the Ocean (yes, the Ocean) and a hilarious walleyed chicken. Don't get me wrong.

" It is a whimsical, crowd-pleasing Disney-animated adventure for the whole family
",0.3818,0.9967,2017-06-23 00:00:00,9,"Ron Clements and Don Hall, the creators of Disney animated entries such as the video-game-plotted 'Wreck-It-Ralph', the musical- esque 'Frozen', and the recent hit 'Zootopia' have returned and have cooked up yet another thrillingly fresh adventure that is destined to appeal to both children and adults. Moana is a charm-filled picture that swarms just about everything it needs to be a superbly entertaining hit. It moves with moments of laughter, moments of charm, and even moments of sentiment. And much like recent endeavors such as 'Frozen', there is some singing. If there is even a slight shortcoming to this animated picture, it may be for being overly nostalgic to the classic Disney animated picture from the 1990s and early 2000s when the studios were at their hay days. However, this shortcoming may undoubtedly serve as a plus for those (particularly teens) reminiscent about the old days of Disney cartoons. Either way, this film falls nothing short of an astonishment to say the least. This film follows titular character Moana (voiced by Auli'l Cravalho), a young Polynesian girl who lives on island run by her overprotective father Chief Tui (played by Temuera Morrison). When the island crops begin dying and their food supply begins depleting, Moana, against her father's wishes, sets out across the sea in search of a demigod named Maui (voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) who is in possession of a green stone capable of restoring the island's crops and bringing peace to her home. Together, the two journey across the sea in an adventure while fighting against the mysterious creatures that stand in their way.Disney Animation Studios has been no stranger delivering the goods when it comes to family-oriented entertainment, even when some of their entries slip into the category of forgettable. However, it is rare that many animated features come as glossy as this one in both the technical and narrative department. Glowing with powerfully dazzling animation including the photorealistic water, which happens to operate as a minor character throughout the story, this film represents the astounding progress of how far Hollywood has journeyed in computer animation. The animation is virtually flawless and hard not to look at. But the real icing on the cake is the story, which takes place mostly on a boat in the middle of the ocean, and execution. Following the eponymous character on an adventure to not only save her precious home but to discover her true self, this movie sparkles with surprises from beginning to end. There is kind- hearted humor to appeal to both kids and adults, and the voice performances are nothing short of spectacular. Auli'l Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson who handle the voices of Moana and Maui respectively shine in their roles, particularly during the musical numbers which allow the actor and actress exercise their singing muscles. If you were one of those people who developed the vexing earworm from songs like 'Let It Go' or 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman', no need to worry! These songs manage to be fun and whimsical to listen to without feeling like to a chore to listen to over and over again. While the aforementioned musical singles from 'Frozen' were not necessarily bad songs, their reputations were greatly tarnished for those who were forced to listen to their friends or family members sing them or play them on the radio constantly. Then there is Alan Tudyk doing the voice of Heihei, a stowaway rooster who's dialogue is greatly confined to a series of squawks and chirps. Overall, there is absolutely nothing in the way of children having a fun time during the picture, except maybe the lava monsters which may just a little scary for the youngsters.Moana is a crowd-pleasing Disney-animated adventure that is bound to fill both kids and parents with delight and satisfaction. Among many of Disney's recent entries, whether or not this one manages to stand out is somewhat debatable. Nonetheless, this movie makes an irresistible, if familiar experience."
" Once again solid effort from Disney
",0.1531,0.998,2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"With Moana Disney returns to its princess formula, albeit with a more adventurous plot and a noticeable lack of romance. Which is a good thing. Disney has tried to re-examine its own traditions ever since The Princess and the Frog, and this movie is a logical continuation of that. And it's still perfectly recognizable as Disney. It's about going on an adventure, finding yourself, believing in yourself, all that good stuff.It's also the best-looking film Disney has yet made. And that's saying something. The water effects utilized in this film are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Someone joked that it would have been easier for Disney to go out and film real Polynesian waters. Because it looks so good I'm not convinced they didn't do just that. The rest of the textures, designs and visuals overall are almost equally as pleasing and it's simply a joy to watch.Also full props to the two leading voice actors and their characters in general. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson continues to prove that he's one of the most likable persons on Earth, but the true star of this film has to be Auli'i Cravalho as Moana in her first ever film role. Her sheer singing talents would have made the character one of the best Disney heroines ever, but it's more than that. It's the will of the character, the passion mixed with fear of the unknown, tempered by fierce will to protect her people. And all this wrapped inside compassion and goodwill. Auli'i easily made Moana one of my all-time favourite Disney characters.Probably the only real complaint I have about the film is the story. Because while it's perfectly fine, it could have been better. At times you get this nasty feeling like you're being manipulated. Like certain scenes are there just because it's a Disney film, not because the film itself needs them. The film also makes fun of Disney's own clich√©s a bit too mean-spiritedly in my opinion.That being said, the ending is fantastic. One of the best I've ever seen. And that's because it's not a big action scene or a showstopper. Rather the scene that saves the day is intimate, quieter, something that fits Moana's character perfectly.Moana is a great film. It's not perfect and personally I do like Frozen and Zootopia better, but it's still head and shoulder above its competition and a proud mark for Disney once again."

Moana is the heroine who pursues her dreams and her mission and, of course, finds personal fulfillment and growth as well. Played by Auli'i Cravalho, it is difficult to imagine anyone better suited to the role. Dwyane Johnson plays Maui, her reluctant helper, a demigod.From the start, the film is revealed as a mythological story.

",0.6908,-0.9785,2017-06-09 00:00:00,9,"Actually it's 8.5 rounded up to 9. Beautiful breathtaking animation with a good Disney formula story. A pleasant enough songbook but not every song is a ""stunner"". Many Easter Eggs and Disney references throughout. (""If you wear a skirt and have a sidekick, you're a (Disney) princess"".) (""You're not going to break into song again, are you?"") Antagonistic villains include war-like Pirate Coconuts that act like Ewoks and magically multiply. A rather pompous giant crab that likes shiny things. A fire breathing monster that ""morphs"" back into the Green Goddess of prosperity and happiness and restores the islands after a thousand years. Maui (the Demi-God) acts a lot like a very-large-in- charge ""Elvis"". He is a shapeshifter which comes in handy for fighting all the ""baddies"". ""Moana"" does impossible stunts and dives and that's what fantasy animation is all about! All characters are treated with respect and there's no stereotypical nonsense, except for the chicken. I'm sure that the Polynesian ""Gods"" will upset a church or two. It's fun-to-watch and almost kept the attention of my two-and-a-half-year-old Granddaughter. Not even ""Frozen"" could do that! A bit too long for an animated feature but most enjoyable. The song that gets stuck in your head after the initial trance-like-state Disney Magic induces, is ""You're Welcome"". The story is loosely based on Polynesian legend and set in the ancient past. My three criticisms about the movie: ""Maui"" the demigod is very large and in charge which upset some critics as a bad stereotype. There is always at least one dead character in most Disney animations (Grandmother). The angry island goddess is very scary for very young children."

The visual effects, from the hand-drawn animation to the stunning CGI, blew me away. These directors had minimal experience dealing with CGI films but, with Moana, they dominated animation in 2016, over fantastic films like Finding Dory and Zootopia. The voice cast was also excellent. Dwayne Johnson, in particular, should devote more time to voice acting, because he was incredible. I also always appreciate nods in animation to great live-action films, like Fury Road. The soundtrack was better than I could have imagined. Lin-Manuel Miranda's writing stole the show enough for me to research more of his music. Finally, Disney has never shied away from strong female protagonists, but Moana takes it even further. They morally dumbed down Maui so Moana could shine more, but she shines bright anyway. A completely three-dimensional Polynesian princess that doesn't need a Disney prince to complete her story. Disney has always been at the forefront of returning women to the central roles they deserve in film. A company that's not scared to tackle the depths of the better sex. I do have my problems with the film, and they are very much as textbook as the positives, but I enjoyed what I saw. And that chicken, though. Top 500 film. 8/10 ‚Äî Ôøºwatching Moana."

" Another beautiful, inspiring tale from the minds and hearts of Disney
",0.7717,0.9991,2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"Moana is the newest addition to the Disney Princess lineup and she does not disappoint. Like the typical Disney princess, she is feisty, determined and absolutely against shelving her dreams or ignoring her ambitions. I really do adore this movie, even though it is not among my favorite Disney Princess films. The character of Moana is very strong and lovable, but I personally felt that this film could have been better and it really does pain me to say that. Thus the 8/10 rating opposed to my 10/10 rating for nearly every other Disney Princess movie.To be fair, poor Moana had to follow Elsa and Anna which is arguably impossible. Nothing that came out right after Frozen was going to do as well and we all knew this. Still, Moana is a delightfully enchanting tale of a young girl who sets sail to save her people from an unknown evil. She certainly has the bravery of all her Disney Princess predecessors! What she does NOT have unfortunately, is a good supporting cast. Not only does Moana not have a GOOD supporting cast...the poor thing doesn't have a supporting cast at all. In fact, I don't think there has ever been a Disney Princess movie prior to this which has so few characters. Sure, she has her parents and grandmother who we see for like four minutes in the beginning and end of the movie. Not much going on there. Then we have the worst animal companions to date (yes, even worse than the useless humming bird and raccoon from Pocahontas) a little pot bellied big and a mentally challenged rooster. Yes, you read that last part right. Neither companion serves any purpose, not even much comic relief which is usually their intention.Then we have the supporting character Maui...who I hope you really like, because it is pretty much just he and Moana on a boat for the entire movie. The Rock delivered an outstanding performance as this character but I simply just didn't care for the character itself that much. I personally would have chosen to have a love interest for Moana guiding her to where she needed to go rather than a somewhat creepy shirtless older dude who is very aggressive to her in most scenes.Now let's talk music. The background music of the film was excellent, as well as Moana's main song ""How Far I'll Go."" It obviously is nowhere near ""Let it Go"" but it is still a truly wonderful song that makes you feel for the character and what she is about to do. But the rest? Very unmemorable...unlike in previous classics like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid where literally EVERY song was gold, these just were not. The Rock's song was actually kind of cute and catchy and he did a great job with it. But other than these two songs, I was very disappointed.The visuals are stunning, particularly the moon which is reflecting on the water that surrounds Moana. I am telling you, she is on the raft 89% percent of the movie, so brace yourself. Auli'i did a fantastic job voicing and singing for Moana though, especially since she was only 14 years old when she first started filming this. I hope it leads to great things for her, she really deserves it.All of the boring, blah scenes in the middle of the movie are worth the awesome twist at the end. I did not see that coming and I found it very enjoyable and poetic. Despite my critiques, this movie is still definitely a must see, another Disney treasure that you will be sure to hold in your heart forever."
" Starts out fun, but with MAJOR flaws
",0.2846,0.88,2017-05-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie starts out well, with enjoyable characters and a decent soundtrack. However, it suffers from too many flaws to be a good movie. I'm not sure how so many other reviewers loved it. Warning: this review may contain spoilers.Problem for those with small children: First off, it was too intense and at times scary for what is advertised as being a children's movie! I'm specifically referring to scenes with the lava demon, as well as when Moana first enters the ""realm of monsters"". I'm glad I didn't take my daughter to see it in theaters or we would have walked out. As is, we had to fast-forward at least 3 scenes on DVD. Lazy writing: It would have been nice if Moana had to prove her worth to Maui or do something that convinces him that he needs her help on his mission. Instead, Moana tags along with Maui because the ocean magically lifts her up and places her back on the boat! The ocean also gets Moana out of all sorts of trouble at various times throughout the movie. It would have been so much better if Moana learned to overcome these obstacles on her own. It is also never explained WHY the ocean chose her instead of someone else!BIGGEST plot hole: So at some point in a conversation between Moana and Maui it is explained that Maui does ~everything~ for his love of the people. Even though he comes across as self-centered, everything he does is supposedly for their benefit in one way or another. How about locking Moana in the cave on the desert island the first time they meet, with no food or water? Had Moana not escaped the cave via a combination of wits and luck, she surely would have perished while Maui was out searching for his hook! Even if she had managed to escape the cave but did so too slowly, she would have found a deserted island with no food, water or boat. I wanted to like this movie, but these flaws are too big to ignore."

" Formulaic, but well-executed
",0.0,0.9964,2017-05-23 00:00:00,8,"The basic plot of ""Moana"" does not contain many surprises for anyone who has seen more than a few children's films. The film not only gives us a young hero, but refers to her as ""the Chosen One"", making it impossible to overlook the film's few deviations from the standard Joseph Campbell formula. That probably sounds like a fairly minor critique, but I feel the need to point it out anyway.Dwayne Johnson is a charismatic individual, so it's a shame that most of the roles he gets do not measure up to his talents. In this film, he plays an arrogant demigod whose physical presence and immaturity do not conceal his compassion and insecurity as well as he probably thinks they do. He's probably the best thing about this movie, getting one of its best songs and a whole lot of clever lines and gags. Our hero, Moana, is a young Polynesian girl who wonders if there might be something beyond the coral reef that her father, the village chief, forbids anyone to go beyond. Will she venture beyond it someday and embark on a grand adventure that will save her people and bring her face-to-face with beings and lands she had never imagined, possibly with the accompaniment of a cute animal sidekick? I'll ask again: Have you ever seen a Disney film?I mentioned that the songs in this film are good, and they're probably the best in any Disney film in recent memory. (This Lin-Manuel Miranda guy might be going places.) Actually, it might be the best Disney animated musical since the 90s. The animation is colorful and vivid, and the script wisely leaves out the love interest character that was obligatory in these movies for a while (although it calls attention to itself for not featuring a princess, which is unnecessary.) If you are a Disney person or need something to show the kids, you could do much, much worse. I just like The Rock."

First the two seemed to be incompatible, eventually forming a friendship while trying to accomplish the same task. Dwayne Johnson shows the normal friendly, yet stern attitude throughout the film.

",0.0,0.9991,2017-05-15 00:00:00,10,"It is indeed very rare that I toss a top rating at an animated movie, but ""Moana"" definitely deserves that.The storyline in ""Moana"" was quite good and rather thrilling. It is a storyline that appeals to both a younger and older audience, because the story is timeless and has classic elements of good versus evil and the uprising of an unlikely underdog heroine. But it is also the story of friendship, forgiveness and acceptance.Shortly summarized, ""Moana"" is about young Moana whom is the daughter of the chieftain of a dying island. She goes against the edicts of the tribe and sail out beyond the reef to search for a demigod who has the power to set things right.The animation and the art style in ""Moana"" was just spectacular. There was just something very alluring and beautiful to the particular style that was used for this animated movie. And the levels of detail was just bedazzling. There were so many impressive details in every scene, and it looked so very real. I was especially impressed with the hair and the way that they had drawn the characters. Moana was very charismatic, while Maui was lovable.""Moana"" also has some good dialogue that keeps the movie up in a constant beat, well assisted by a good amount of action and storytelling.And while were are on the topic of dialogue, then ""Moana"" had some really good voice acting talents on the cast ensemble. Auli'i Cravalho really did a wonderful job, and she is quite talented. It was also a treat to have Dwayne Johnson do the voice for the demigod Maui. I didn't know that Alan Tudyk also voices a character in this movie.There is a fair amount of singing in this animated movie too, and it actually worked quite well in favor of the movie, for different reasons. The first being that the songs were quite appropriate for the story and fit naturally into the movie. The songs are also quite nicely orchestrated and performed. Usually, I am not overly keen on songs in animated movies, but ""Moana"" did it quite as well as ""The Little Mermaid"" did back in 1989.I was instantly blown away by the comedic element of the chicken that came along on the oceanic journey. That chicken was just downright hilarious and really spiced up the movie quite a lot, pardon the pun.As I mentioned in the start of my review, then it is very rare that I give a top rating for an animated movie, and only have done so once before to ""Epic"". But ""Moana"" ranks up alongside with it, because this is a fantastic animated movie in every sense of the word. I watched it with my family, and we all loved the movie and were very entertained by it.This is definitely an animated movie that is well-worth watching and this is a movie that rightfully belongs in the collection of anyone who enjoys animated movies. And this is an animated movie that you can watch more than just once."

Maybe a bit much for kids under 7, but it has a lot of appeal for most ages.The characters have a lot personality and their expressive faces are really amazing. The score and songs are surprisingly catchy. What really stood out for me is the gorgeous ocean (which plays a central character), in all of its colors and moods. Idyllic beaches, clear aquamarine lagoons, Starry skies, violent waves, lightning storms and stunning luminescent scenes abound.There is an underlying mother earth wisdom which tries to surface while teaching us about early Pacific culture, mythology and their history as ocean voyagers. The main character Moana is equally wonderful as a curious toddler (utterly cute), and as the young heroin who musters the courage to carry on the destiny of her ancestors. Her Demi-God sidekick Maui is also a great character.I have had a lot of reservations with some of Disney's more recent productions, as they tend to be more trendy and less traditional, but this one manages to have progressive sensibilities while maintaining that high standard we expect."

It was an unique twist to use real life Polynesian culture to convey this Disney story. It was a beautiful telling of an unknown story. Both Cravalho and Johnson were great in this film. They were both able to show humorous sides but also very funny sides. I thought Johnson was especially great as he showed a sorta arrogant and downright jerky side. It was a different take on some of the previous roles we have seen him in before. Some of the others actors such as, Rachel Hale as Gramma Tala and the unknown voice of the chicken. They were very funny and great additions to the story I thought the songs were done quite well. ""How Far I'll Go"" was obviously the feature song but personally I enjoyed ""Your Welcome"". I thought every song did what it was supposed to and really added to the story line. The plot of the story whiles being the classic Disney story it was done well. It added the unique Polynesian culture and some great side stories.All in all, this was a very well done movie. It was a welcome addition to the Disney princesses classics and deserves the right to have a sequel."

Moana is trying to reconcile what she feels inside (passion for the ocean) with the expectations of her father and extended village family (to stay put on the island).Who of us isn't lost, just a little bit? From the high school kid who is asked, ""What are you going to study?"" to the retired person who is asked, ""What are you going to do now?""Aren't these two critical questions: who are we and what are we meant to do?The personal realization that Moana comes to at the end of the song is awesome, innocent and profound.

And she discovers that her passion and longing for the sea are aligned with her ancestral roots.

Demi-God chap - selfish, conceited, vain, ineffective, emotionally repressed, thief. Crab - as above (I'm assuming he's male). Coconut Pirates - murderous but ineffectual (I'm assuming their male).Female characters: Moana - bright eyed, aspirational, quick learner, visionary, empathetic, brave, strong, amazing, indefatigable, indomitable, perceptive. Granny - as above plus supernaturally gifted. Earth Goddess thingy - was only trying to kill people because the male character had robbed her of her precious.Yawn. Increasingly Disney is working as a SJW - righting perceived inbalances in society.

" Disney's New go-to Form for Their Princess Movies
",0.0,0.9908,2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"This is how Disney should portray their princesses. Don't get me wrong, there will always be a place for that damsel-in-distress or ""I must find a man"" mentality from Disney movies... but really, we don't need any more of those. Moana is a strong-willed progressive female who shows us how a ""princess"" (daughter to the chief) can be her own person and not rely on some buff brave man to come and save her every time. A good change of pace from the older Disney movies where women had a very conservative attitude about them. Not necessarily saying that that's bad, if you have that mind sent, but its refreshing to finallysee it in a huge blockbuster Disney movie, especially with the changing attitudes of the world today. My only complaint is that there isn't a lot of character development in the film. She starts out brave and a leader, ends with some more knowledge about sailing and is more brave and more of a leader. Don't get me wrong, I love her character, but it would have been nice for more development."
" Amazing ocean!

All grown on the sheen of the scales ""Little Mermaid"" (1989), the magic of ""Aladdin"" (1992) and the legends of ""Hercules"" (1997) and all growing up on the phone call ""Frozen"" (2013) and the ""Zootopia"" (2016) Will conquer the joint creativity of the beloved creators of 2016 called ""Moana"".With the support of a whole team of anthropologists, teachers, scientists, linguists, cultural experts and navigation specialists, the Disney creative union tells an amazing story based on the culture of the Polynesian people unknown outside the Pacific. In the center of the story is Princess Moana, the daughter of a tribal leader from the fictitious island of Motunui, which embodies thousands of Polynesian islands. She is chosen by the ocean to save her world and people from the ancient spell and death. And her heroic mission is fun, successful and easy, until the culprit of all ills, the demigod Maui, interferes with her. Well, or just a two-hundred-year-old offended man.Magic and brightness, detailing and technique, concreteness and intelligibility. All the age categories are captivated by that fantasy, childish spontaneity and purity, which is hidden in the rationality of hidden images and meanings from adult directors: the dumb crab is full of shine, the nature that has become offended by consumers-people, the powerful, but infantile demigod, and the most Ordinary girl as a standard of overcoming fears and courage to swim against the current. However, not so much the iridescent childishness in the hearts of the creators makes the cartoon exciting and deep, how much an adult sense of proportion in their heads.The disobedience of parental care and the pursuit of a dream are not in conflict, but in harmony with love and respect for the feelings of their ancestors and especially the advice of a wonderful grandmother. The acquired independence, wisdom, friendship and courage accompany the basic message - the preservation of nature. Computer graphics unobtrusively replaced by futuristic drawings in the good traditions of folk art of Polynesia. And when the next song would be superfluous even for the genre of the musical (which complements comedy, adventure and fantasy), one of the characters honestly and openly says, as if reading the viewer's thoughts: ""If you start singing, I will definitely vomit!"" For the company with such subtle irony, the natural hindrance of the unruly curly hair of the heroes, the play with the water and the awkwardness of Maui are simply amusing. The abundance of musical motifs and variety of songs are amazing. And admires the non triviality of the find in the form of hand-drawn tattoos: in general and mini-Maui in particular. Being located on the heart and moving all over the body of the carrier, he, like the conscience of his possessor, discourages that from stupidity, cowardice and betrayal.Following the awards of the British Academy, Golden Globe and Oscar in 2017, Moana did not become the best animated film, giving way to the ""Zootopia"". However, for the viewer, it will definitely become a classic and synonymous with kindness, purity, courage and dreams for many years to come. Because this is the perfect cartoon of the perfect graphics, ideal characters, story, sound, music and send. The only negative, which for someone even a plus: after viewing everyone wants to make a tattoo.10 of 10"

" Your typical Disney movie.
",0.0,0.9912,2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Moana is a big budget movie by Disney, with hawaian Auli'i Cravalho as Moana, the protagonist of the movie, and Dwayne Johnson as Maui, a legendary shape-shifting demigod, who plays a good cop bad cop routine. This movie has a lot of singing and the classical Walt Disney's rain of gags that splashes your face every second. Usually, in a Disney's movie , there're more hits than misses. In Moana, there's still more hits than misses, but there are more misses than normal. The singing in the movie is alright, with Cravalho providing a stunning singing performance and with an OK Dwayne Johnson, who sadly you realize since the first song he is not a singer. The idea for the story is actually amazing (Which reminded me of The Village, by Shyamalan, about a girl forbidden of abandoning the little island where her family lived, even when she had the most adventurous soul on the island. This idea provided a lot of possibilities to the screenwriter. But when the idea starts to develop, then the movie cuts down to size in terms of quality. The screenplay is kinda clich√© and after watching the first half hour, you know how it's gonna end. The screenplay might be the biggest flaw. Still, the animation is really, really good, and there are a lot of great jokes. It will be a lot of fun if you get your kids to watch it, and anyone in the family would enjoy it, because of its light-hearted premise and the family-friendly but smart sense of humour. It's a good film, but it might be one of the weakest of Disney's catalogue, which is near to perfect anyway. I think you should watch it, you will have a good time."

The plot is mediocre, linear and predictable, the characters are poorly described and thought, tending to become even annoying from time to time, while the action is also disappointing, in a way in which almost nothing interesting happens. They attempted to make it a comedy so the movie is filled with jokes, sarcasm and humor, but all in all, it doesn't manage to actually make you laugh. It's almost like they tried too hard, but what they've actually done is to ruin the severity of the intrigue and focus on other least important factors. The one thing that is really funny is her retarded chicken companion. To point the upsides, it has flawless animation, some good singing and a bit of suspense now and then.

" Another winning movie from Disney.
",0.5267,0.9997,2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Most people had assumed that ""Moana"" would be the best animated movie of 2016. The idea of an Disney Animation Studios film being set in the Polynesians seemed different for the studio, but also exciting. Being on a long distance airplane ride, I decided to give the film a watch. While it was certainly not the absolute best of 2016 (""Finding Dory"" or ""Zootopia"" would have that distinction), ""Moana"" is still a great movie. It's great story, some fun characters, the most gorgeous animation, and some catchy songs makes it another great movie from Disney Animation Studios, the studio that showed audiences that they can make great movies once again.The film begins with the a tale being told of how the heart of the God, Te Fiti, being stolen by the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) as a gift for humanity. However, he is attacked by the lava demon Te KƒÅ, and disappears with the heart and Maui's powerful fishhook lost to the ocean. We then meet Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), the daughter of the chief of the island Motunui. The island is slowly dying due to Te KƒÅ's evil being spread with the heart of Te Fiti gone. However, the ocean gives Moana the heart and she is chosen to go find Maui and restore the heart of Te Fiti and save the world. Accompanied by her pet rooster Heihei (played by Disney's apparent ""good luck charm"" Alan Tudyk), she comes across Maui, some coconuts pirates, a crab (Jemaine Clement) obsessed with everything shiny, and the lava demon in one exciting journey.The one thing that ""Moana"" has over ""Zootopia"" is animation. The animation in this film is some of the best animation that I have seen from Disney in years. When it needs to be colorful, it's colorful. When it needs to be dark, it's dark. I also really like the 2D animation of Maui's tattoos animated by animation legend Eric Goldberg (who also animated the Genie in ""Aladdin""). I would describe the 2D animation if artwork from Hawaii was crossed with Keith Haring's art. The story is also really is well done. It's adventurous and exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat like a good movie should. I also really like the performances, particularly Cravalho's. She is a phenomenal actress and singer and for a debut film, that's quite an accomplishment. She performs Moana like how a sixteen year old girl should (unlike Rihanna's awful performance in ""Home""). Dwane Johnson is also fun and funny as Maui, and I also thought his singing was pretty good. Speaking of singing, I should probably talk about the songs. Written by Lin Manuel Miranda, who took the world by storm with ""Hamilton"", the songs are some of Disney's best in history, even better than ""Frozen"". They're catchy and memorable and they also tie into the story as a good musical should. I think my personal favorite is the Oscar nominated ""How Far I'll Go"" which also demonstrated Cravalho's beautiful voice. I think my only big problem with the movie was the fact that they were working in the fact that they wouldn't do specific clich√©s you see in Disney movies too many times. Now, I like it when a movie makes fun of a clich√©, but ""Moana"" probably did this like over ten times or something. But, I still thought some of them were pretty funny nonetheless.""Moana"" is once again another great animated movie from Disney. It has everything that a great Disney animated musical should with some great animation, great songs, great stories and great characters. It may not be as good as ""Zootopia"", but it still really really good. It's a straight up wonderful movie. I really enjoyed it. All I can say to Disney is ""thank you""."

" A well animated adventure with good music and beautiful scenery
",0.8807,0.9924,2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"This movie has gone under-appreciated because it's compared to other Disney pictures. It's a traditional princess adventure, yes, we've seen it a million times, but if I wished to introduce a child to Disney this might be the first movie I would show them. After this, 'Aladdin'. Well of course if the child in question was like 5 years old then maybe I'd start with 'Dumbo' or 'The Jungle Book' or something but 'Moana' is pretty much the quintessential teen/pre-teen animated adventure.First of all, it's gorgeous. The Polynesian-like characters, the green tropical islands, the rafts and the clothes and the items, and above all the sea, the shining and flowing and glowing transparent water, all are utterly beautiful. It's the technically best-looking animated movie to date. (I added 'technically' because anime movies like 'The End of Evangelion' or 'The Tale of Princess Kaguya' achieve artistic imagery beyond anything any Disney adventure can offer.) Second, the songs are compelling. I've been listening to the soundtrack afterwards and every song has merit. 'Shiny' by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords was unexpected and worked partly because of that, 'You're Welcome' is catchy and fun, and the others are emotional, full of bright-eyed wonder. Maybe when years go by I will grow sick and tired of 'How Far I'll Go' like everybody's grown sick and tired of 'Let It Go' but only time will tell. I don't think that will happen because 'How Far I'll Go' is shorter and it's reprised a couple of times so it's not such a perfect single, more like a piece of a musical than a self-contained hit.The story - well the story is about finding your place, dealing with expectations, breaking traditions and such. It works but is nothing groundbreaking. The jokes often fell flat, especially the dumb Twitter joke, but the physical comedy involving Maui was pretty hilarious. It was refreshing seeing the designated Disney Princess treated like that."

There are some points where the motion study is so natural and fluid you ALMOST forget you're watching animation, truly ""the illusion of life"". And despite its non-western mythology and absence of white folk, I think old Uncle Walt would have approved. Disney uses Pixar technology, and they've got skin and hair and smoke and clouds nailed. Still some problems with water and especially fire. Textures are looking very natural, the tropical colors clean and saturated. Oh, and there are some points where the motion study is so natural and fluid you ALMOST forget you're watching animation."

The story itself is quite original and inspired, but the movie was too short for good character development. Most of them made me feel like they overreact easily. Also, They cheated on explaining a plausible story with that self-conscious water, it was cheap. Lots of scenes were too fast, couldn't they lengthen it to 130 minutes instead of 107? Beside that, and the subjective likeness of each of us, anyone can appreciate that movie."
" Visually beautiful, but problems with plot and characterization cause this movie to stumble.
",-0.2732,0.9584,2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"I have been largely unimpressed with Disney's recent animated movies, and many of my criticisms with them hold true with Moana. Looking back at Wreck-It Ralph, Zootopia, and Frozen, it seems to me that Disney is more interested in building a visually beautiful world than building a great story. This is true with Moana. The animation is wonderful. The world is gorgeous. The story, however, is rather dull and shallow.The world is by design fairly sparse. There aren't a lot of characters in this movie. So to make up for that, the story or the characters need to be particularly compelling. Unfortunately, they aren't.Disney breaks no new ground with Moana's story. That isn't new for Disney, and to be fair, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many good movies are just well-done re-imaginings of classic stories. But Moana isn't even that. At every step of the way, I couldn't shake a feeling that I'd seen it all before. The story never gripped me nor did it leave me feeling fulfilled. Thus, the film just feels empty.If either Moana or Maui were engaging characters, this movie could have been good. Despite a good performance from Auli'i Cravalho, Moana had a very small character arc. She was not that different a person at the end of the film than she was at the beginning. For much of the film, she had very little agency of her own. The plot seemed to carry her along, rather than she driving the plot.Maui did everything he could to cause the plot to stall. This could have been great, as his antagonistic attempts to stop the main character could have worked as the central conflict. But since Moana is rarely actually trying to move the plot forward, the conflict just seems to be her-vs-him, which is mildly interesting at best.It's a shame. Moana could have been such a good movie. But it suffers from the same failings as most recent Disney animated ventures: wonderfully crafted world without a story worthy of that world."

" Fun follow-your-dreams-empowerment Disney adventure flick
",0.6808,0.9939,2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,"Disney princesses have changed a lot since the company started pumping them out. In the case of Moana, the daughter of a village chieftain is strong, brave, athletic, and determined to save the world. She also denies being a princess altogether, although in one of the film's occasional Disney in-jokes she is told that if you've got a dress and an animal sidekick, you're a princess.The movie fits very much in the girl-empowerment ethos that has replaced Disney's original waiting-for-the-princess trope. This is very much a heroic, mythic adventure story. It's also quite funny, with a brash demigod, a cheeky ocean, and the world's dumbest rooster all doing their shtick. The songs are decent. There's a nice please-nominate-me-for-an-Oscar empowerment song that's kind of catchy, a rousing number involving sailing ships, and the best, a David Bowiesque thing called Shiny. It's not the best Disney soundtrack, but it's a pretty good one.The animation is gorgeous. At least on television, a good deal of the scenery looked photo-realistic, and the island setting allowed for a lot of natural beauty. There are also notable sequences involving living tattoos that were apparently hand drawn.Well worth watching."
" Chicken Discrimination
",0.0,-0.9624,2017-03-14 00:00:00,5,"Here's my two-cents and a collection of nitpicks. First and foremost, I didn't go into this movie knowing it was a musical. When the first musical song chords hit, I knew I was going to be in for a long droll of a film. Every song in this film is forgettable. There weren't enough memorable or catchy phrases in the choruses of the songs to hold onto, and the melodies were lackluster at best with basic chord progressions to invoke a feeling of false excitement in the average viewer. I will say, though, that I enjoyed the mythology and lore behind the movie, and since ""Moana"" isn't set in the real world, I could find myself getting invested into the adventures Maui had. That was one reason I didn't dock the movie's rating as much as I would've. Another reason was because I liked the design of the Kakamoras' ship(s). The little contraptions that split the ship into multiple parts and the consideration of tying the drummers onto ropes as they bounced up and down were pretty thoughtful. One other reason I didn't dock the rating was because Moana's stupid non-aging pet pig didn't come on the voyage. Thank. Freaking. Goodness. Pigs grow up rather quickly. Even if it was a pygmy pig, it shouldn't have been a dwarf the entire time. Speaking of animal sidekicks, the main reason I didn't like this movie was because of the portrayal of Heihei, the literally retarded chicken. I've worked with chickens and kids with moderate to severe mental and physical disabilities (yes, I've worked with handicapped chickens), and the way Heihei is portrayed is insulting to all of the mentally disabled. It's not funny when Heihei doesn't do something you'd expect a chicken to do. It's not funny when they give it eyeballs the size of golfballs. It's not funny when they don't depict any aging of Heihei, even as Moana grows up, similarly to the pig, because the chicken's feathers never appear to molt or bleach in the sun. Or maybe it's not funny because I have a stubborn sense of humor and take offense to movies that depict my favorite farm animal in a poor light. ""Ha ha! It's funny because the chicken looks ugly and is dumb!"" He didn't have any redeemable qualities; he was just there to hold the kids' attention because the rest of the movie was so boring.From the very beginning of the movie, the characters were out of touch with reality. Kids don't cry because they sense impending doom based on possible mythology. They care about getting their snack fix and making boom-booms in their pants than the inevitable demise that is their deaths. Infant Moana not being scared of death isn't a sign of courage; it's a sign of naive curiosity. A lot of the reactions in this movie bring up several questions, too. Why would the village suddenly consider they were voyagers in the past just because Moana said so? Why wouldn't they do something to ensure that their lives would be preserved instead of simply take the word of their chief--unless they were ruled under supreme dictatorship? How come it was okay to listen to the slightly cooky granny just because she was eccentric? You don't do that with the schizophrenic, do you? Do you stop on the street and listen to what a babbling homeless man on drugs has to say and take it seriously? No. The ocean's character isn't clear in this movie. This isn't water-bending like in the ""Avatar"" show, and it's not telepathic waves from Te Fiti. It's its own thing. So, yeah, why did it choose Moana? Not only that, its motivations are inconsistent since sometimes it helps Moana, sometimes it doesn't. Maybe it's an allusion to how the ocean can be both benevolent and relentless, but as a kids' movie with weak concrete evidence, I'm going to say it's because the writers were lazy. Maui's tattoos also freaked me out because while their origins are cool, the way Maui's sprite animates and reflects his conscious (?) makes me wonder if the sprite is a shoulder angel type of character or his inner thoughts worming through his skin. It wasn't really funny, and it would have been better if we could have seen some character development between Moana and Maui instead of having the tattoos doing the projection. I will say: one of my few appreciations for the film is how there wasn't any hint of romance or platonic intimacy between Moana and Maui. It isn't like ""Frozen"" where you have a feeling something's happening between Kristoff and Anna, and it isn't like ""Pacific Rim"" where Raleigh and Mako were forced to work together and maybe chemistry would ignite between them. Moana and Maui were their own people. They weren't terribly interesting people with good chemistry, but they worked off each other in ways that didn't have me any more annoyed than I was bored with the setup. Overall, this is an average movie that I went into with high expectations from the initial concept design, but the songs, the offensive nature of pandering to kids, and the dull transition of plot made this a very forgettable experience. I can't even quote a full sentence from this film. That's how bad it was. Oh, and closing thoughts: that was a desperate move for jokes trying to pull ""The Little Mermaid"" into the post-credits."

Music was low effort from Disney, Enrique Iglesias and Britney Spears gone Emo, backed by swashbuckling orchestral sounds with the merest hint of melody, rhythm, chords, humor, singalong potential, and calm. The songs accompany visuals of huge grimacing faces, spiraling - roller coaster camera movements, which only a kid raised up on stroboscopic cartoons can watch contentedly (in a state of zapped stupor), and Soothing like an air raid siren of emotional turmoil/crisis, which is about 2 notes off key all the time. No dance routines, No choreography, No group chorus at all, no chords, no grooves, no fun rhythms. None of the songs was actually a song, because there were no instrumental partitions. The vocalists were good but they were expected to do only one style of music, with no room for musical instruments and accompaniment. Family music is simple to write, popular and fun to listen to. Great musicals have good theme tunes. Its a shame to apply so much low quality score to such an awesome animation. Little mermaid songs were much better, more consonant, less shouted and confused. Snow White would sing in a motherly tone: maternal and paternal songs. These are commercial emo-trash songs which would rattle little ear drums without nourishing with proper emotional/educational value. The children wont go home infused with musical ire. They will be rattled, emotional, emboldened and discordant. One or two songs were 6/10.most were 2/10.Worth 10/10, with 2/10 for the low composer values. The songwriting was fine."

Surround a young quasi-islander girl with a big over-weight quasi-demi-god, a few animal ""friends"", a father afraid of going out beyond the reef because his friend drowned? and a need to return a stone to its source because that demi-god stole it? while disrespecting the father/chief? and becoming a leader of the people before the father dies? of which, women weren't allowed to be chiefs?Disney's ability to dilute any folklore is well-known, in order to make a quick buck by selling junk merchandise to kids. The tattoo suit was a terrible idea, but kudos for pulling it off the shelf quickly.Disney has a habit also of producing ""girl power"" movies, which I find to be cookie-cutter style. Disney has found a formula and they rinse-repeat with the characters, music and script. Recently this has been true with movies like Frozen, Tangled and Brave.In the meantime, Disney ignores the male lead role with the ability to change and overcome challenges in life. (12) movies in the past have featured male leads but none of which meet the standards set forth today by Disney standards for female lead roles. No, I don't include Pixar movies.Of those (12) movies, only two have meaningful scripts and two have sad endings. Peter Pan (1953), Sword in Stone (1963), Jungle Book (1967/2016), Black Cauldron (1985), Aladdin (1992), Hunchback (1996), Hercules (1997), Tarzan (1999), Emperor's New Groove (2000), Treasure Planet (2002), Brother Bear (2003), Meet Robinson's (2007). I could really dig deep and trash this movie for all the things they got wrong, but I'm going to skip it and just point out the few things I liked about the movie.(1) The animation is good. (2) The movie is about the Pacific Islanders. (meh) There was one tune I thought was catchy, the rest were crapThat's it. The rest of the movie is junk to me. It is a cookie- cutter movie with the same theme, with the same songs, with the same direction. Sure there are some amusing parts of the movie, but over all I really didn't care for it.I also was disappointed in the use of ""Disney staff from the Disney resort"" who are of native heritage for the bonus features. It became obvious to me that Disney was doing a fluff piece to show the general public that ""islanders"" love working on the movie, which is a partial truth.Overall this movie is an amusing production which will satisfy the little kids and the simpletons. If Disney really wanted to make a movie about diversity they could make the same movie about a gay boy trying to be chief after his father dies."

" The Vidiot Reviews...
",0.0,0.5844,2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"MoanaThe best thing about growing up on an island is that it prepares you for if ever you get deserted on one.However, the princess in this animated-musical sees no benefit to island living.The daughter of a domineering chieftain, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) yearns to stray beyond the coral borders of her Polynesian community, but her father forbids voyages abroad for fear of sea-monsters.When she uncovers the real reason behind the leviathans and of her tribe's seafaring legacy, Moana and her pet rooster set sail to capture a shapeshifting demigod (Dwayne Johnson) and liberate an island deity from captivity.Although it does not stray far from the typical Disney princess story standards ‚Äì an animal sidekick, an overprotective father and a bevy of songs - it does however do a commendable job incorporating those criteria in an amusing fashion.

But the story left me wanting more and in a sort of disappointed way. *Non-plot related spoilers ahead* -The Kakamora coconut pirates were interesting, but had could have used even just one more scene later. -Would have been nice with scenes of Maui's backstory rather than just talking about it.-Environment.

" Another conventional, predictable story that Disney executes incredibly well
",0.3384,0.9966,2017-03-07 00:00:00,8,"The Disney fairytale mold sets sail for Polynesia in ""Moana,"" the studio's latest animated musical featuring a strong female lead character, and a film hoping to build off the success of ""Frozen"" and ""Tangled."" Although audiences are unlikely to be as familiar with ancient Polynesian mythology as they were with the stories of Rapunzel or Hans Christian Andersen, ""Moana"" isn't all that different from these films; Disney has simply dressed its contemporary revamp of the tried and true fairytale formula in oceanic trappings.Although mentioning any kind of formula may seem dismissive or chiding of ""Moana,"" the film absolutely works thanks to a healthy dose of creativity and heart, not to mention self awareness. Despite seven Disney minds claiming a story credit on the film, the studio wisely assigned scripting duties to Jared Bush, writer of its previous 2016 hit, ""Zootopia."" The writing has some of the same edginess, quirkiness and self-awareness of that film (and others) that has allowed Disney's house brand to churn out better films than Pixar of late.Combine that with Disney's longest-working directing duo of Ron Clements and John Musker (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Hercules"") and you get an animated feature that's both exciting and different yet fundamentally sound and familiar. Nothing about the ""Moana"" story is surprising. Heard the one about the girl who comes from royalty, has an overprotective father, longs for something beyond what she knows and must go off on an adventure with animal companions and fulfill her destiny? Exactly. But ""Moana"" knows that. In fact, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) insists she's not a princess. And her problems aren't typical of a princess, specifically that she doesn't want or need to love anyone or marry someone. The movie really centers on her personal adversity. Although she faces some standard Disney conflicts from outside forces including her father's stern rules (Temuera Morrison), a cocky travel partner in demi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and some creatures on her journey, there's no clear villain, at least not one who needs development. Ultimately, she must outlast nature and stand up to or outsmart male characters and believe in herself to succeed. Nicely done, Disney.Yet creativity does more for the movie than feminist underpinnings. Heihei the chicken, the dumbest and strangest animal companion of any Disney movie (voiced of course by Alan Tudyk doing nothing but squawking), provides countless off-beat laughs while Johnson does nicely with the traditional silliness, slapstick and braggadocio humor more common of animated features. The ingenuity of his transformations and tattooed cartoon self being a secondary character help elevate the entertainment in a major way. A second act appearance by Jemaine Clement voicing a giant crab is also a highlight, and his atypical song is absolute brilliance if you listen closely.Riding the waves of success from ""Hamilton: An American Musical,"" composer/songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda's fingerprints are all over the ""Moana"" soundtrack. His incredible verbal flow is on display in Johnson's song ""You're Welcome"" and the aforementioned Clement song ""Shiny,"" while the film's piece de resistance, ""How Far I'll Go,"" floods the story with emotion each time it shows up in a way that makes ""Let It Go"" feel like a hit song rather than an essential part of ""Frozen.""Even in the form of a predictable story, this degree of heart, in tandem with the visual beauty and creativity, make ""Moana"" another successive hit for Disney. All formulas eventually grow tiresome, and the template that allowed ""Moana"" to thrive will eventually need to be reworked, just as Disney had to do with its animated musicals in the 2000s, but for now it's on a roll. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

" See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me, And no one knows, how far it goes
",-0.296,0.9992,2017-03-07 00:00:00,9,"They're called 'I Want' songs, moments where characters survey the world around them and declare their dissatisfaction in the only way they can, through music and lyric. Quasimodo with the best view in the world but no way to touch it, shunned for his appearance. Rapunzel prancing around the tower, longing to see the world outside. Ariel with her museum of human utensils, transfixed by a handsome prince on two legs. And now Moana has given us one of the trope's best with the heart-soaring ""How Far I'll Go"", which marries the lyrical genius of Lin-Manuel Miranda with a skipping, spirited Polynesian princess (she insists that she's heir to the chief, but as Maui points out whilst winking to the audience, ""If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, then you're a princess.""). Listening to the way in which the song transitions from its chorus to second verse with punchy, irregular beats makes it clear that this is isn't just shower business, it's a spoken plea to the ocean's call that tugs at her heart. The more cynical of the Disney veterans might be rolling their eyes at this point - these moments are just about obligatory for their animated features, and everyone loves to rally behind a character stuck in a rut, longing to seize their destiny with both hands. But the strength of Moana's 'I Want' moment isn't because it is an act of feminist rebellion ala Tangled or Brave, where the protagonists broke free of their cages, but a courageous bid to save the island and family that she treasures. The initiative lies with her, to go beyond the reef and seek a way to restore their home. Moana's opening reminds us of Hercules, beginning with epic myth and heroic battles shrouded in mystery, only to pull back humorously and wave away historical accuracy. A reaction shot of the captivated children tells us all we need to know the pick the main character - she's dead centre, with a pink flower in her hair and a big smile on her face. A following scene reiterates her calling, and doubles as a stunning tech demonstration at how far animators have come since Finding Nemo's watershed moment more than a decade ago. Moana, a bundle of toddler cuteness, waddles down to the beach, urging and protecting an equally tiny turtle hatchling, and then the water shifts out of her way like a loyal subject and wraps around like a living, breathing aquarium. What's especially impressive is how the underwater scenes shimmer under the sunlight and tremble along with the current, and how it reacts to Moana's curious touch, churning with bubbles and showering her with water droplets. The major studios have all but arrived at photorealism, and audiences will soon be spoiled for choice. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson looks and sounds the part of Maui, the demigod half-heartedly recruited on Moana's quest, and who sports the same broad, satisfied smiles. The voice acting musters all of the theatrical flair of his professional wrestling background - he flexes his action figure build with swagger, and in the endlessly catchy ""You're Welcome"", manages to take credit for things he probably had no business creating (the tides, the sun and the sky to start, but there is so much strutting bravado and confidence crammed into the song that you're likely to cheer along like Moana does). The lofty figure is best when he is at his most theatrical, which is why I came to admire him not for his soft interior, but his selfless actions in the climax. He charges the lava demon Te Ka with little hope of victory, and has his weapon charred and broken beyond repair, but instead of cowering, he bellows at the behemoth before him, and launches into a fierce haka. This is the traditional war cry of the Maori, a proclamation of strength and resolve, and in the face of certain defeat, Maui is choosing to sacrifice himself so that Moana can make right his own wrongs. It doesn't get more heroic than that. Another endearing feature of Maui is his animated tattoo counterpart, which serves not only as comic relief but also as an extension of his conscience. The tattoo works in the most universal type of comedy, pantomime, and the way in which he constantly scolds, guides and keeps a running score on Maui's naughtiness is refreshingly original. Along the way the pair battle a sassy, egotistical crab who hoards treasures and puts a face to all the nagging, doubting voices in the back of both Maui and Moana's minds. Tamatoa seeks to crush dreams and sneer at their aspirations; he's moulded his identity around shiny superficiality, and dismissed everything but the skin deep. Only later do they buck his accusations and yes, find their true self that lies deep inside. Watching Moana reminded me of another movie which focused on the plight of a Pacific Island community and their heroine - Niki Caro's Whale Rider. While their approaches might be a little different, what is remarkable is their authenticity. We're long past the red-skinned Indians of Peter Pan, or the causal hand-waving of history in Pocahontas, and Moana shows it in strides. Her journey offers a chance to prove herself, and through it she reaffirms the pride and strength she holds in her Polynesian ancestry, trusting in it to guide her along the way. Witness the reprise of her 'I Want' song, which initially poses an identity crisis. Then her grandmother dies, but not before passing on their cultural legacy, in the form of a radiant stingray which provides that extra push to sail beyond the reef. And as she rides the wave, she proclaims loudly and proudly: And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me/It's like the tide; always falling and rising/I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me/That come what may/I know the way/I am Moana!Ôªø"

Perhaps this is due to the Polynesian setting or the morally ambiguous Maui, played perfectly by Dwayne Johnson, but most likely it is it the simple magic of Disney ‚Äì the wonder for both children and adults has reached its peak with the perfection of the classic formula. For once, the clich√©s make the film more enjoyable. The quality of the animation helps too: it's clear they have reached the pinnacle of blending realistic textures with stylised designs, creating an aesthetic beauty that few other companies can match ‚Äì Disney have mastered water to the point it looks better animated than in real life! Even the music has been perfected here, the annoying catchiness of Frozen's tunes replaced by memorable but effective songs that fit the culture and setting of our adventure. A childlike warmth was awakened in me and many other adult members of the audience as the film brought the emotional highs of the Disney renaissance without the modern subversion of the classic tropes. While Moana sometimes threatens this with pop culture references, the film thankfully keeps to mostly traditional values and morals; a step above many children's animated films released today.Moana is good, old fashioned Disney magic; the traditional narrative and morals updated with stellar animation and an awareness that's effective but never overpowering enough to threaten the integrity of the Disney formula.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more."
" Interesting story

Moana character is nice and in combination with Maui demigod is great. Maui is funny, full of muscle and tattoos and have a chemistry with the polynisian princess. Moana have two ""sidekicks"", a pig and a cock, HeiHei, who are very funny and you will enjoy them along the story."
" Another Great Disney Animated Film
",0.6249,0.9392,2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Once again Disney Animation has made another great animated film. Both Moana and Maui make a great duo and it's really fun to watch them work together to achieve their goals. There are also some very fun action scenes and the songs also were good. The animation done to the jungles and the oceans are beautiful and fascinating to look at, so far every new Disney Animation film has improved their animation. As far as issues go, the only problem is that there were parts of the film that felt too quick and some situations were resolved a bit too easily. But even with some of those issues, the film is still a must see for all ages."

The music is amazing but I didn't think that there was enough of it. The villain is extremely forgettable but I love the other characters. Lin Manuel Miranda really outdid himself this time. I know that I'll be humming the songs for months to come."
" Beautiful
",0.5994,0.9986,2017-03-03 00:00:00,10,"Oh, it was such a beautiful movie!!! So nicely made and it had an amazing story. I don't think that I've ever seen an animation based on a Polynesian tribe, so it was very refreshing. All characters were so beautiful, with long curly hair and I was just loving them. Baby pig and chicken were unusual pets and it was another new and fun thing to see.I loved that the main character Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) was really brave and tough and strong and that the semi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) was sort of grumpy and pessimistic. They made a nice pair, similar to that of a human's heart and brain. Heart is positive and optimistic and brain is rigid and pessimistic. I really loved everything in the movie, everything seemed new, refreshing, never seen before...Even the crab was different, with a shiny shell... I got so inspired and encouraged by the ""Moana"" to follow my dreams and inner visions that I was carrying the mood of this film for the next two days. I even dreamed ""the Sea Monster"" at night (and I'm 33).It was a powerful movie, with a magnificent story, great dialogues, beautiful songs, cute funny pets, new culture and a great lesson. It was simple yet incredibly rich...It was perfect! Everyone can enjoy it, get inspired and learn from it! As they say: ""The greatest wisdom lies in simple things"" (although I'm sure it wasn't simple to make it, it does look like an enormous effort, so thanks for the makers!)"
" Amazing Must-See
",0.5859,0.9952,2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Moana is an intriguing and sensational Disney movie that is a must-see by everyone. It is visually appealing with breathtaking animation and is full of catchy songs that everyone will find themselves humming after seeing the movie. From the young to the old, the deep yet simple plot of Moana will appease to everyone. It is a great family movie but can also be seen and loved by even those who dislike Disney movies. Moana tells the story of an adventurous, free spirited teen that has always dreamed of sailing the ocean because of her special magic connection to it. Despite her father's pleading and risk of danger, Moana sails to find Maui, an all-powerful demigod, to embark on a captivating adventure. The movie includes popular stars such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson playing Maui, and Lin-Manuel Miranda writing the well-known songs from the movie. The plot of Moana is quite different than other Disney princess movies, and some may see that as a weakness, especially the lack of love interest in the movie. But this contrast to other Disney movies is what makes it so remarkable. Moana breaks the stereotype of Disney princesses which shows that they have to have perfect barbie bodies and need to depend on a man to come save them. It shows Moana as an independent young girl who only cares about pursuing her life dreams and not about what other people think of her. This a great role model for young girls to look up to and is one of the many things that makes Moana such a phenomenal movie."

The characters, both main and sidekicks, were uninspiring and the story unoriginal and a bit too long. My worst part were the singing bits. I'm a huge Disney fan and I love the songs from every Disney movie I've ever seen and this movie had the worst ones. It was the first time I found myself saying ""Oh no, not another song"". Not one was catchy or funny and some I found to be off-beat and meaningless. 5/10 only for the beautiful island the story took place, the water effects and the magnificent colors."
" A worthy addition to Disney's princess canon
",0.4404,0.9982,2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"While Walt Disney Animation Studios have been providing escapism for both children and adults since the 1930s, their attitudes towards more 'exotic' cultures and portrayal of certain racial stereotypes - especially in their early days - have always raised an eyebrow. Perhaps this is why they are now leading the charge in diversity, and after gobbing up billion-dollar franchises and taking them underneath their wing are now dishing up hugely successful blockbusters led by strong-willed heroines and multi-ethnic ensembles. Following the unexpectedly poignant Zootopia earlier this year, the studio have struck gold once again with Moana, a dazzling if comfortable step back into more traditional Disney territory.As the daughter of chief Tui (Temuera Morrison) of the Polynesian island Motunui, the young and naturally curious Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) has a duty to remain with her family to watch over her people. But she has dreams of sailing out to sea to explore the unknown lands beyond the horizon, and it would seem that the sea agrees with her, as it parts to reveal a precious stone early on before her father insists that she return home. The island has always provided everything the inhabitants need to survive and flourish, but without warning, fish numbers are starting to dwindle and the coconuts are rotting, and it would seem that an age-old fable of the theft of island goddess Te Fiti's heart is to blame. The story names powerful demigod Maui as the thief, and tells how he was later shipwrecked by a lava demon after losing the heart and his magical fish hook. Defying her father's wishes, Moana goes in search of Maui to restore the heart and save her island from starvation.Written by, amongst others, Disney legends Ron Clements and John Musker, Moana is incredibly straight-forward, reaching back to the likes of The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992) and Hercules (1997) for a proved formula that served them so well during the studio's renaissance. The film often reflects on this, with Maui (voiced by Dwayne Johnson, who always sings and does it well) pointing out that although she may not be a princess per se, she has the look, spirit and animal sidekick to fit the profile. It doesn't take long to pick up on the fact that you're not watching anything striving for originality, but you'll be too taken aback by the gorgeous visuals on show and the stellar voice acting bringing these familiar Disney archetypes to life to care. Very much a warmer companion piece to Frozen (2013), Moana feels both classical and very modern.Also like Frozen, there are many memorable tunes to enjoy, here by Broadway composer and playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and Oceanic musician Opetaia Foa'i, although none of which will reach the dizzy heights of 'Let It Go'. One particularly toe-tapping number comes from Jemaine Clement as a treasure-hording crab, whose unmistakably Flight of the Conchords-esque twang may suggest he had more input that simply providing the vocal chords. Yet for all the jaw-dropping animation and comic relief prat-falls of pet rooster Heihei (Alan Tudyk), the main strength of Moana is Moana herself; stubborn, intelligent and incredibly capable, she doesn't rely on men to save the day, nor does she get distracted by a love interest. It's here that Disney manage to subtly subvert expectations without rubbing your face in it, creating a well-rounded and believable character in the process. An extremely worthy addition to Disney's princess canon, Moana proves that a dose of heart and imagination can reignite even the most done-to-death of formulas."
" Fine Family Film

But it is the first animated Disney movie since Tangled I haven't been in a hurry to watch back. The only sequence that I enjoyed on the same level was the crab, with his song ""Shiny."" It may be my favorite Disney song since my childhood. But I can't tell you any specific problems with this film. It may be the best looking animated film ever made, as the ocean and island scenery was spectacular. It just didn't capture my imagination the way Big Hero 6 or Wreck It Ralph did. The characters were memorable and well designed, and I was excited to hear it was going to have a Polynesian setting. But somewhere the story was just lacking. It didn't feel as well developed as the other recent films, almost like it went into production without the extra revisions it needed. Even so, I expect it will be loved by generations of viewers, so I'll give it a 7 out of 10."

The majority of the music is bland, the animal sidekick is overly pointless, the ""hero"" is a very bad Han Solo and this movie will quickly be forgotten.I managed to peg Disney's Frozen movie right on the nose that it was an OK movie but that the song was catchy enough to become a hit, nothing is certain but this movie is trying to hard without taking any risks.Some further problems are that the facial animations are sometimes a little off, there are no real stakes since the undefined power of the ocean is a deus ex machina that has carte blanche to do whatever it wants when it feels like it without any in-universe limitations."

",0.0,-0.9533,2017-02-24 00:00:00,5,"Moana does quite a few thing in the bad way, some more in the average - and few godly. The bad lies mainly in the writing with the following:1) The adults are always so stoopid. Don't do this, don't do that. Why does the princess always have to fight against these DUMBtulds. Seriously Disney, don't be so clich√©. 2) The tattoo score counting was rigged! The princess clearly lost. So unfair!!The things that were so-so:1) The OST. ""Worse thing about Disney movies is the singing."" While I loved The ""Dwayne Johnson"" Rock singing 'You're Welcome', some of the other songs were bad. Especially the lyrics were rather cheesy and cringe-worthy. 2) Moana. I didn't like her character nor did I enjoy seeing her character development. ""I am a princess who has been raised as one."" Yeah, same old story which was never good to begin with. The gold:1) Chicken. Should have been the real main character of this movie. Should be the president of United States. Also Pollo, Mexican and a total genius of our time. Did Disney secretly give their support to Trump by making this character? Either way, Chicken made the movie."

This is a one liner, but developed into a longer version Except the initial parts, this film is like a limited cast/character film. Most of the film takes place in the sea sailing around fighting evil force to break the curse. But at the end, you would feel this kind of story is not worth for a feature film. It looks a perfect short animation theme.Disney never disappoints its fans, well, for me. So I enjoyed it, it was fun and entertaining, but too simple. The characters were cute, this is a wonderful film for kids and some grownups would too enjoy it. But this is not for all, unlike most of the Disney animations are. Dwayne's voice lending for one of the lead characters was good, but the girl steals the show. Especially if you are a kid and/or a girl.The best film since 'Lilo & Stitch' on the similar theme about Pacific islands' people. But it reminded me 'Whale Rider'. Overall, I think the story should have been improved a bit, in particular by including a few more characters at least for the partial appearances. This is not the best animation of the year, also definitely the bad one to skip. If your purpose of the watch is entertainment/timepass, it is good at that.6¬Ω/10"
" Moana is a family friendly must watch
",0.4939,0.9982,2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,"The movie Moana starts off like many other Disney movies: thus setting the stage for the rest of the movie. Moana starts off as little girl and you soon see that she, like many other princesses, is aspiring to be something her family and society doesn't want her to be. This is a very similar idea to the movie Mulan in which she joins the Chinese army even though it was man's job and proceeded to win the support of her people and everyone was happy. So when the movie Moana started in a similar fashion I was hesitant that it would be a stale Mulan-ish re run. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Moana is a fun, cute, feel good movie that was enhanced by the plot, voice actors, and fluid script that I would recommend for all ages. For starters Moana's unpredictable plot is intriguing due to the unknown element of the ocean exploration. The movie incorporates the unpredictability of the ocean by making Moana curious about it from the time she was born thus conveying the unpredictable plot while at sea. These multiple unexpected setbacks that occur on the ocean enhance the plot and makes it less cookie cutter. However, one down side is since this is a Disney movie there has to be a happy ending because it's Disney and they aren't going to make a children's princess movie have a sad ending. Another factor that made Moana an exciting movie was the voice actors for the characters. Especially Dwayne Johnson because his voice and tone fit the character Maui perfectly. Maui is a very large, muscular, stocky man and Dwayne Johnson is a large man in real life too so it was natural for him to play the role. The confident and deep tone he read Maui's lines with was very accurate to the stereotypical big macho man, but he also made his voice soft enough that it wasn't frightening to young children who make up the majority of the audience for Moana. Auli'I Cravalho also did a very good and appropriate vocal acting job for the audience as well. She used a very energetic and inspiring tone when Moana was trying to convince Maui to come with her on the adventure. As well as used a sterner tone when things started to get out of control. However, my favorite voice actor was Rachel House who played the old grandma Tala. Her tone was spot on with an old knowledgeable grandma. This was displayed by her compassionate and shaky voice which typically signifies wisdom. Overall the voice actors preformed their roles well and added to the movie's positives. Lastly Moana had a script that just flowed with the movie and didn't seem too cheesy. The dialogue was also not too complicated or hard to follow either since it was intended for a younger audience. For example, Moana's dialogue with Maui was childish and filled with simplified words that displayed frustration instead of using super complex words to get the same emotions involved. By doing this it actually made it more enjoyable for an older viewer as well because it was very easy to understand and was sort of a childish throwback tying it all together. All in all, I would recommend Moana for anyone under the age of 10 or wanting to relive a little portion of childhood. Between the heartwarming warming plot, emotionally touching voice actors and childish script Moana was a solid Disney film. I would rate it 7/10 stars and would say it is worth the watch for all ages."

" Great visuals, great music.
",0.8481,0.584,2017-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Moana, while most certainly a cookie-cutter Disney movie, stood out among others with excellent music and even better visuals. The fanciful story follows a young girl, Moana, on her quest to save her island from the mysterious force that is killing all vegetation. The characters in this story suffer from subpar characterization, but as far as children's movies are concerned, this was not unforgivable. The music in this film will, in my mind, be ranked up there with the music found in ""Frozen""- unforgettable and instant classics. In addition, the visuals in this film were absolutely astounding. I found myself caught up in the incredible detail with that animators put into everything. All in all, while the rebellion of the young girl was certainly typical of Disney (and highly irritating for myself), I found the plot to be further from where the company usually ventures, and I found the film entirely refreshing."
" A Fun Movie (must watch)
",0.5106,0.999,2017-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Henny's Movie Review: Moana (aka Vaiana)In three words: A Fun Movie.With Pixar dropping the ball lately it is good to see that Disney is picking it up with great movies like, Tangled, Zootopia and now Moana. Yes, they made a mediocre over-hyped movie named Frozen, read my previous review for my thoughts about that movie. Moana really doesn't disappoint it has a good pacing, a great cast, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I could just leave my review at this and tell you to go and watch this movie, but let's see ""How Far I'll Go"".Moana is a story that takes place in Ancient Polynesia, when a curse reaches the island Mata Nui a chieftain's daughter is determined to go on a journey, to find a demigod named Maui in order to stop the curse.Like most Disney movies this is a coming of age story. Moana is a chieftain's daughter who is struggling with her love for her people and her love for the ocean. She is determined and a strong character. It is wonderful to see her grow and find herself throughout the movie. She is voiced by Auli'I Cravaljo and it fits like a glove, perfect love her accent. Moana is joined by a demigod named Maui. He starts out as an egotistical/funny character but we quickly learn why and see him change for the better. He is voiced by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and if you know The Rock YOU know what to expect. You can never go wrong with The Rock.Other supporting characters were there to setup the plot and exposition.The music, as expected, was typically Disney which is a good thing because I love Disney songs. After the movie you just can't get it out of your head. All the scores were very good. It did the basics like underscoring a scene but it also carried the movie for a huge part.The three-act-structure. Moana has a great beginning, good middle, and a great ending. Furthermore, the pacing of this movie is fast in a good way. It doesn't hold on to a scene for too long and the movie knows when to cut.The cinematography was beautiful it really shows that the creators have done their research. I love the bright colors and gorgeous sceneries. It would appear that Disney's new approach to movie making is starting to pay-off, by remaking their old animated movies into real-life and mocking their old movies with their new 3d-animated movies, they are breathing new life into their movies. As aforementioned in the introduction Moana is a must see movie that won't disappoint.I give this movie a 8.5."

" Life of Moana.
",0.0,0.9628,2017-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Finding Sing to have a catchy chorus,I asked a family friend about other recent animated films. Impressed by Disney's recent run,I was intrigued to hear high praise from this pal of their newest title,which led to me going to meet Moana. The plot:Told by her dad that she must not cross the ocean on her own due to tragic events that happened in his life, Moana Waialiki finds the ocean calling her to retrieve a mystical pounamu stone that demigod Maui had stolen from lava demon Te KƒÅ. Seeing the fields and wildlife start to die out,Moana decides (and is secretly supported by grandmother Tala) that the stone must be returned to Te KƒÅ in order to save the island. Joined by her pet rooster Heihei,Moana sets sail to discover Maui, Te KƒÅ,and Moana's own coming of age adventure. View on the film:Nervous about just being a ""celeb voice"" flatly reading lines, Dwayne Johnson shows that he had nothing to worry about,as Johnson gives an utterly magnetic performance as Maui that connects with Johnson delivering one-liners with a speed he showed in his WWF days,which are joined by an unexpected dramatic thoughtfulness that Johnson carries Maui's care for Moana with. Making her debut performance, Auli'i Cravalho gives an enchanting performance as Moana,via Cravalho voice swimming with a Disney Princess passion to protect the island,with a feisty kick for Moana to take her own path to solve the crisis.Given the challenge of coming up with ""classic"" Disney songs, Lin- Manuel Miranda goes for ""talking songs"" where the characters explain what they are doing,which whilst breezy,do suffer from a lack of catchy lyrics. Keeping Moana on her own in a small boat for a good amount of the movie,the screenplay by co-writers/(with Jared Bush/ Pamela Ribon/ Aaron & Jordan Kandell) co-directors Ron Clements/Don Hall/ John Musker/ Chris Williams sail a gripping Road Movie wave,lit by crisp dialogue opening up Moana's self-discovery.Combining CGI with hand-drawn animation,the directors draw an utterly lush landscape,shimming with exquisite ""fresh"" water effects and smoothly designed,emotive faces. Jumping out of the water,the directors cleverly use the hand-drawn elements to give the movie a depth which makes the fiery action land with a bang,as the life of Moana is found in the ocean."
" Tangled joins Kung Fu Panda to save the environment
",-0.3612,0.9952,2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"There's a theory that in this world there is only a handful of truly original stories, first told ages ago, and the rest is just a combination and a rehash of those. Well, I'm not sure about the whole entirety, but the story of Moana definitely sounds kinda familiar. ""Sounds"" being not just metaphorical, hehehe.In case you want your details and explanations dry, it's a story of two persons who join forces to overcome a greater evil, discovering their true selves along the way. Sounds indeed familiar. Right, because every other story out there, from Luke Skywalker to Jason Bourne, is about fighting evil and self-discovery. But is it a curse or a blessing in disguise? After all, being familiar doesn't necessarily mean being boring. And it's the details of the particular implementation that make all the difference.Speaking of details, it's simply impossible not to fall in love with Moana, that's how beautifully this film is drawn. The lush colors, the beautiful landscapes and the sea, the adorable characters - everything here is an eye candy. Add some decent (albeit slightly lacking variety) singing and a cute and vigorous young heroine - and you've gotten yourself another Tangled, this time without the castle and blonde hair but with tropical islands and catamarans to compensate for it.But while this film is undoubtedly a joy to watch, it falls just a little short of becoming a real hit. Probably because, unlike his latest predecessors, it didn't bring into the genre anything fresh. Tangled was the first really successful animated musical in decades. Frozen built on that success and redeveloped the world of fairy tales into a place where girls can actually take the lead. And while Moana has all the strong points of its older sisters, giving us just that is not entirely satisfying. Which doesn't mean that you won't have fun watching it, but the chances that Moana will win a permanent spot in your heart and memory are fairly slim."
" Great potential, but....
",0.6249,-0.2882,2017-02-17 00:00:00,5,"If you like Disney, I mean Disney classics, this is not one of that. The idea is to go to the roots, whit a lot of music, lot of songs, singing etc. Well that some time do a magic, but some time it doesn't.The story had a great potential, really great. Interesting mythology, adapted to a story. Something like ""Song of the sea"", not Celt mythology off course, but interesting. So much potential to build characters, to give a depth to whole story, to create cinema animated magic- but we get a stupid chicken, princess and a good narcissus magic guy. The whole story didn't catch that serious note, nothing was considered serious, the approach to the legend was, let do a lot of singing and wacky jobs and that is it. I won't say that is unwatchable, but you loose some interest after 15 minutes watching it. The main reason for that is that you can not find a respectable note, and off course, singing. SO MUCH SINGING... When I say singing, I mean unnecessary songs. They are rely not needed. If you take a songs, the whole movie would last around 30 minutes. But the biggest sin is that this story had a such potential. It is a rely, rely god story. It has everything, a drama, end of the world, demons, heroes, the whole Maori mythology, a fight between good and evil, a message, everything. But some jerk decided to take all that without a hitch of seriousness, and denied us a great Disney movie. The only surprise is that at the end Moana didn't kiss with a Maui. With all that in my mind, the move deserved a 5 out of 10. It has his moments of entertainment, and it has his moments of fun and laugh, it is a good movie for children aged 3 to 9, and that is it. Songs are simple, but not catchy, I watch a movie half a hour ago, and I'am trying to remember a melody of one of the song- I can't. To say at the end, if you have a kids age 3 to 9 it would be a great for them, and they will forget it soon."

And when i saw it, it didn't disappoint me. The best thing is the animation. Is the most beautiful animation i ever seen in a Disney movie. The water, the characters designs and Moana expressions are the most watchable thing i ever see. The characters are decent expect Moana and Maui who i think are the most likable. Moana as a character is so pretty, more that the rest of Disney Princess. Maui is a little bit annoying in the beginning, but then he most likable in the rest of the film and it has some of the funniest lines in the movie. The movie has more jokes that in any Disney princess movies and sometime is hilarious. The songs are good, 3 of them are fantastic and the rest are OK or unnecessary in the film. And the last good thing in the film are the voice cast who the most part is phenomenal. Auli'i Cravalho as his first role is so beautiful and fantastic that who she did the voice of Moana and Dwayne Johnson is funny as Maui. But the film has some troubles in the writing like some clich√©s or conveniences that happens in the film. Some jokes are not funny when is gross humor. And the crab villain is not funny or interesting and makes the movie boring. And some of the song are unnecessary. But overall, Moana is better movie that Frozen o Tangled in respect of characters or writing. Is not better that Zootopia, but is enjoyable for everyone.7.4/10"
" Awesome Disnay movie ever
",0.6249,-0.8659,2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Another wonderful movie to add to the Disney classics. 2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It is awesome movie.A small pounamu stone that is the mystical heart of the goddess Te Fiti is stolen by the demigod Maui, who was planning to give it to humanity as a gift. As Maui makes his escape, he is attacked by the lava demon Te KƒÅ, causing the heart of Te Fiti as well as his power-granting magical fish hook to be lost in the ocean. Young Moana Waialiki, daughter and heir of the chief on the small Polynesian island of Motunui, is chosen by the ocean to receive the heart, but drops it when her father, Chief Tui, comes to get her. He insists the island provides everything the villagers need. Years later, fish become scarce and the island's vegetation begins dying. Moana proposes going beyond the reef to find more fish. Chief Tui rejects her request, as sailing past the reef is forbidden.Moana's grandmother, Gramma Tala, shows Moana a secret cave behind a waterfall, where she discovers her ancestors were voyagers, sailing and discovering new islands across the world. Tala explains that they stopped voyaging because Maui stole the heart, causing monsters to appear in the ocean. Tala then reveals that the darkness has been spreading from island to island, slowly killing, and now Motunui is next.Tala falls ill and with her dying breaths tells Moana to set sail. Moana and her pet chicken Heihei depart in a drua to find Maui to restore the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. After a typhoon wave flips her sailboat and knocks her unconscious, she awakens the next morning on an island inhabited by Maui, who traps her in a cave and takes her sailboat to search for his fishhook. After escaping and catching up to Maui, Moana tries to convince him to return the heart, but Maui refuses, fearing its power will attract dark creatures.Immediately after, sentient coconut pirates called Kakamora surround the boat and steal the heart, but Maui and Moana retrieve it. Maui agrees to help return the heart to Te Fiti, but only after he reclaims his hook, which is hidden in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, and held by Tamatoa, a giant coconut crab. They successfully retrieve it by tricking Tamatoa. After Maui have his hook, Fearful that returning to fight Te KƒÅ will destroy his hook, Maui abandons Moana. Moana still want to return the heart from the ocean to Te Fiti alone. Maui, having had a change of heart, returns to help Moana. Maui distract the lava demon, and his hook is destroyed in the battle. Realizing that Te KƒÅ is actually Te Fiti without her heart, Moana asks the ocean to clear a path for Te KƒÅ to approach her. She sings a song, asking Te KƒÅ to remember who she truly is, allowing Moana to restore her heart. Te Fiti returns and in gratitude, gives a new canoe to Moana and a new magical hook to Maui before returning to her island form.Moana bids farewell to Maui and returns to her recovering island with Heihei. Later, the villagers begin voyaging and set sail in search of new islands, as Maui and Tala accompany them in their giant hawk and manta ray forms, respectively."
" It was refreshing

But at the beginning of the story, the ocean chooses Moana but based on her parent's experience have prevented her from going into the ocean. The typical child grew and was groomed to be the successor to the throne but feels something was missing. Until drastic times called for drastic measures she set sail to find Maui to return the stone to this goddess in Tahiti. and then Maui and her overcome personal struggles and other ocean adventures together and then this is were it went, blah blah blah. In the end all is good. Blah Blah Blah.The soundtrack and animation were great! The comic reliefs were entertaining but the story line was too easy to predict. Although, I am 28 years old and still watch cartoons so maybe to a toddler it wasn't so predictable after all. I'll ask my toddler to comment next time."

A long time ago, there was an evil force that kept the islanders on the dry land. Suddenly, the heart of the world had kept the secret too long, and there were the chosen one. Does this sound like a fairy tale made by Disney? Well, that is 'cause it is. Moana is a little too sweet, little too deep in the attempt of being cute, funny and amazing. Moana is a good movie. Moana is fun and cute. It could have been a lot better with a more serious matter of conveying the story, the actors and the jokes. This is keeping the movie in the 6,5 barrier instead of jumping up to the good old ""Eight of the great"", speaking of IMDb.In the late days, the animation movies has begun to shape the appearances of the characters as a little nod to the real actor behind. So in here; Dwayne Johnson shines through and gives Maui (and yes, ""The Rock"" is Samoan ((as Maui)) in real life) a solid voice and atmosphere. It is done with such intensity that ""The Peoples Eyebrow"" is projected onto Maui. The production team also gives the character the little ""narcisisstic touch"" that The Rock so shines with, speaking of his proud and hard muscles. That is both fun and good to watch.Nice nod to Raiders Of The Lost Ark 41:30 into the movie. Nice nod to The Abyss with the water as a lifeform... see especially at 1:18 into the movie....and.... you're welcome.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent and fantastic animations. - The actors : They are all animated. Did you miss that? (Dwayne Johnson struggles to keep it simple and believable.) - Entertainment : Yes, it is. Just to see all the nods to Dwayne Johnsons character ""The Rock"" in WWE is funny. All those tattoos.... - Age : 76,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)"
" Disney better than expected
",0.4404,0.9842,2017-02-10 00:00:00,10,"I gave this 10. every movie that can give me goosebumps deserve 10 stars.. So two of my friends convinced me to watch this greatness of a Disney movie with them, i had only seen some posters with the movie, not even a trailer or hadn't heard anything about the movie.When i watched the movie, i got goosebumps of the music, something only Disney can do to me, i might be a 23 year old single man, but Disney can hit me right in the heart with these kinds of movies, it sorta feels like a childhood memory to watch the movie, even though it couldn't be one. because it's new. I also happens to fall in love with the main protagonist, like i did with frozen, Disney princess are my dream, i'll never meet anyone like Anna or Moana, but i can dream. This movie kinda needed a really sad moment to be a 100% Disney movie, but it works without it. I will never get to old to watch Disney movies... This hit me right in the feels with the music.. :D This movie is great you should watch it!"
" what a delight!
",0.636,0.9975,2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous! But, besides the visuals there is such a heart and imagination and creativity to this movie. Moana is such a likable, smart, and relatable person. the voice work for Moana is so sweet and so good. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and it is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see it again!"
" Moana a self-discovery journey
",0.0,0.9974,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Moana brings the Mulan (1998) formula and it delivers a home-run. The movie begins on a slow pace so you can start getting to know what the character has to deal with in order to get you ready with the main dilemma for Moana which will be to either follow your passion and dreams or be the princess you are supposed to be ignoring your goals, this may be a detractor for some people who likes a fast paced action movie since the beginning. With the newcomer Auli'i Cravalho as the voice of Moana, she did a wonderful job on bringing the character to life and giving it that desire to see her triumph in her journey of self-discovery. We are taken alongside Moana on her growing up phase acting as the teenager she is instead of the grown up they want her to be. This road takes us to meet our main support character which is Maui the demigod voiced by Dwayne ¬®The Rock¬®Johnson. Dwayne Johnson delivered an incredible voice acting job as Maui, we haven't seen ¬®The Rock¬®on this type of roles and surprisingly it could be one of his best role in recent years, this said the character Maui also had it's journey to once again know himself and remember who he was and why he did the things he did, this was something that made the character special since on the long run you could also be striving for Maui to change and be better. Now for the movie as a whole it had it's usual clich√©s every Disney movie has, this movie delivers it's formula with a well thought script and story that it didn't feel as the same thing we have seen even though you may know what it's going to happen. For the songs in the movie they were done perfectly, even though it will not be a trademark song like Frozen (Let it Go), this movie did well to get the children's engaged and sing (I am Moana), but this is not memorable as Frozen at all, so for this category as Best Original Song it's highly unlikely it will win, but it well deserves its nomination, also with the contribution of Lin-Manuel Miranda director of Hamilton in the movie this definitely deserved its spot in the Oscars. With all this said, you will definitely enjoy the journey of Moana and Maui the demigod since the movie delivers well thought songs, a good Disney formula and each of the characters with their own unique personality will engage you in a certain way that you will be rooting for both of them to accomplish their goal and at the end you will be happy with their results. It deserves its solid 8/10."
" Nice tunes, OK film
",0.694,0.995,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"A good film, with great music.Disney have gotten to the point where they no longer make movies, they make musicals. There have always been songs in Disneys films, but they were to convey something, not to hide the lack of plot. Disney has clearly spent a lot of time on the music, and the obligatory ""I'll tell the audience what I want""-song is great. All the other songs sounds just a bit to much alike, with the exception of Maui's song. The first part of the film is well executed, the background of Moana's life, her relationship with her family and the world around her, hopes, dreams and wishes. It's great and emotional. But from the moment she takes off it feels more like you are watching a few shot films cut together into one. Every section so so disconnected from the rest that the plot is about as great as a 8-bit video game. There is the Disney ""Minions"" coconut army. There is the giant singing crab bit. There is the Te Fiti section. That is it! Inbetween those bits you have the same glue-like formula; Maui pushes Moana in the ocean, the ocean brings her back, the chicken is ""derp"", Moana talks about Maui's responsibility.I liked the film, but I feel that it had more potential then what was done. The plot is weak and underdeveloped. Moana is the only character that has depth (well she better be since there are barley anyone else in the film). Maui is more of a bully older brother and his behavior gets old really fast. The chicken is a great comic relief, but really serves no purpose other than that through out the whole film. The best part is Moana's relationship with her grandmother, disregard that she comes back like a Jedi, a scene that actually made her previous death less emotional.I don't regret watching the film, but when I look back I don't feel it was really worth going to the movies for. Unless you watch a massive IMAX 3D version, you might as well wait for the Blu-ray to come out."
" Still playing to full theaters
",0.2023,0.98,2017-02-04 00:00:00,9,"I saw ""Moana"" tonight in the local movie theater. I have been wanting to see it since Thanksgiving and expected the audience to be few. To my amazement the cinema was almost full, and I can see why. ""Moana"" is a fabulous movie--it will certainly leave you crying and smiling. I would imagine most of the folks in the audience now have seen it 3 or 4 times. I served a number of years in the Army in Hawaii, so I was attracted to the movie for that reason, and it was certainly a great movie going experience. The animated graphics capture the magic and beauty of Polynesia, the land and the ocean. And the story is a lot of fun. Highly recommended for all ages."
" Expect a fun, good time. But has room for potential
",0.4767,0.9934,2017-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Moana is a beautiful and stunning film, the best parts of the film being the animation and the music, of course with Lin-Manuel MIranda on board this project. So Moana is actually an animated film that I've been following since they casted Auli'i Cravalho, I watched the clip released by Disney in which they told her that she got the part, along with Dwayne Johnson being on board I was immediately attracted to this project. I thought that it was really great that Disney decided to venture to a more different model for their Disney princesses brand and to explore a culture as fascinating as the Polynesian culture.The end result a brilliant film that is really just a fun exciting adventure. The voice acting was stellar both from new comer Auli'i or Dwayne Johnson and it was really great seeing their two characters on screen bonding and getting used to working together. The music in the film was fun and catchy with very meaningful lyrics without being too in your face and having the characters break into song every scene, the musical pieces were used sparingly and reasonably. So, I would like to compare this to two of Disney's recent properties. First of all: Frozen, Frozen was alright in my opinion, compared to Moana I do believe that Moana is for a slightly more mature audience and though Frozen touches on certain important and deep aspects regarding the love between siblings it seemed a much more introverted film. Of course perhaps due to the actual story of the film however there was always something that never clicked with me when it comes to Frozen and the vast openness of Moana seems to be the difference maker that made me enjoy this movie a lot more. The second film is last year's, Zootopia. Now this is a film that Disney has produced that I feel does a great job in conveying very mature themes. With a film like Moana, it is fun and adventurous but could do with in my opinion some more mature aspects, perhaps touch on issues such as environmental or deal with nature as it sort of already does. I do feel that things like that is the next step for Disney, to really put what they have done in Zootopia into practice on some of its other properties."
" Enjoyable entertainment with character
",0.6908,0.8709,2017-02-01 00:00:00,10,"My friend has strong connections with Hawaii and urged us to see Disney's latest animation.With an open mind and no expectations, I settled back to see what was on offer.Many of the portrayals I found surprising, and, for me, that added to the character of the film.The animation flows impeccably.I found the timing and rhythm of the story telling to be right on target.Scanning some of the more disparaging reviews makes me wonder about how one's frame of mind can change perception, perhaps seeing too many films creates impossible-to-meet expectations.As a moderate-to-low film/TV watcher, ""Moana"" was for me thoroughly enjoyable and engaging from beginning to end. I was being told a story I had previously not known even existed, and the story was told very well.""Well done Disney"", that's how I felt as I left the cinema."
" Bad Message on Parenthood
",-0.5423,-0.9789,2017-01-31 00:00:00,1,"Unlike ""Bolt"" and ""Zootopia"", Disney tried again another musical, i.e., people singing instead of talking. That apart, unlike other Disney musicals, e.g., ""Mulan"" and ""Tangled"", the songs in this film are very repetitive. I lost count of how many time the main character's song is reprised, with maybe slightly different lyrics every time, but I stopped caring after the second one. The explorer's song, one of the few with Polynesian language thrown-in and that doesn't sound like a cheap Western European cartoon musical, is somewhat ""fine"", although also repeated unnecessarily too many times. Maui's and Tamatoa's songs are happily jazzy and unfitting with the film, but helped me to survive till the obvious ending.Yes, the ending is squarely obvious after the first few minutes, just after the story of Maui's deed is told. The producers tried to make it less obvious by hiding the spiral on Te Ka's chest, but it's a Disney cartoon, who couldn't tell that Maui would come back to help (actually, who couldn't tell he would eventually ditch Moana in the worst possible situation, just to raise the ""thrill""?), who couldn't tell that it would be Moana to fix everything (and not Maui, despite all his godly powers), who couldn't tell that it would have a perfectly colossal happy ending...?! Even the only character to die returns Obi-Wan-Kenobilistically to help Moana (what just makes sense, I guess, as Disney now owns the Star Wars franchise). Seriously, spoilers? Disney created a type of film which makes all spoilers simply meaningless (like, who couldn't tell the ending of ""Frozen"" just by seen the poster, with the two sisters side by side?) Granted happy ending is not fun, at all (and no, watching ""how"" the characters get there is not enough nowadays for enjoyment, this is not opera, this is cinema).Maui is by far the best character, but just like Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", absolutely unimportant for the plot (except for stealing the heart of Tahiti, oops, ""Te Fiti"", which any other unrelated character could have done, any and everything he did was useless to change the course of the story). Maui's self-conscious line asking Moana not to start singing was funny, but the fun vanished swiftly as the songs restarted filling up the space where actual story should be. I have to regard Heihei, the chicken, funny, although fully useless, too (don't worry, if it wasn't there, the stone would have fallen in the ocean, and it would have returned it to Moana, just like it did before).Why is Moana the main character? There was no need for the character to be female, unlike Mulan or Merida. For the plot, Moana could be a shrimp, it wouldn't make any difference. I guess Disney wants to sell more toys to girls, and that's all. According to psychologists, men have a need to outstand, women have a need to fit in (this is not Wikipedia, you look for the references!) Thus, boys take any crap you throw at them, as long as it has flashy LED's and makes a lot of noise. Girls are usually more picky, they use to choose what appeals to them somehow (even if only because ""everybody at school has one""). Heroines have a better chance to sell them anything, I suppose, so there comes another female leading character. Do you doubt it? Disney went as far as making Maui literally label Moana as a ""princess"", what she vehemently denies, just to make it sink even deeper in the brains of the young. That's pure evil!Talking about evil, why are the parents always the evil people that don't let the heroine be, well, heroic (or even have a little fun)?! It had to be the fun-funny-and-cool, sweeter-than-honey, always friendly/compassionate, knowing-better-than-the-parents Grandmother the one to help Moana. Granny inflamed her desire to disobey her father's orders, which almost got herself drowned, what was exactly what he was trying to save her from (what is also completely nonsensical, as the ocean for far too many times saves her and others from drowning, to the point I stopped worrying that any character could die). That was a very evil message, that anyone can be a better friend than the parents. Sure, there are bad parents out there, but that was clearly not the case, as he was trying to protect her. Disney poisoning!The plot has so many holes (some of which I have already exposed) that the ending is almost detached from the rest of the film. For example, why didn't the ocean simply return the stone to Te Fiti, why did it need a human to do the job? Moana wouldn't be able to do it without the help of the ocean, which opened a path to Te Ka.The background message, ""don't mess with Nature"", was weak, far below ""Mononoke Hime"" or even ""Over The Hedge"". It's absolutely unbelievable that this film got such high scores. Those scores tell much more about the ""status quo"" of contemporary society than the film's quality.Why do I bother coming here to blemish this film? Because it's an evil film, by an evil corporation, watched by too many children out there."

When most animated movies state that they are for the whole family, they often are quite childish and boring for the older members, but I can gladly say that this movie would be enjoyable for all ages. For example there are jokes that might be wasted on the younger children that gave me a laugh. The scenery for this movie is beautiful, serene even. What worked for Tangled and Frozen definitely worked for Moana. The voice acting was ideal, beautiful singing voice from Moana. Really emotive singing and meaning behind the lyrics, while respecting the Polynesian background. The movie is simply a feel good movie, great storyline that is easy to follow but isn't spoon feeding the audience. If there was to be a negative, it would be that the main characters did not really develop their friendship, there was little character development from Moana and that the movie was quite short in comparison. Regardless, it is a great movie that I will be watching again. Fantastic job Disney!"

The whole story line is standard, but there were some humorous scenes here and there which kept me very engaged. There are lots of songs in the movie. It might be a trend from Frozen since both have a princess as the leading character. However, I am a little disappointed about the quality of the songs, especially considering the involvement of Lin-Manuel Miranda who created Hamilton, a masterpiece. I am little confused about the ability of the ocean. It is not consistent at all. It left me wondering why doesn't the ocean directly spray water all over the Te Ka?"

It's very important that we have feminist movies on the big screen 'cause it's a way of influencing people in a positive way. And by 'feminist' I mean it's not chauvinist or oppressive.

" Enjoyable but forgettable
",0.2382,0.8708,2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"Disney has been having some very hard times in the past 2 decades with hits that are not memorable past 2 year mark. Moana has some beautiful visuals and the mythology of Maori people is interesting indeed but the movie is one of the worst cookie cutters of Disney in a while, the last one this bad was Brave and even Brave had a better sense to its clich√©s than Moana. The biggest problem with Moana is the lack of any actual challenge or opposition. Everything is just handed to her in the most typical Disney way possible. Do you remember Finding Dory's scene when we finally found her parents? We had been facing some fierce challenge and by the time the parents were shown many believed that the moral of this story is to try hard to achieve the dreams but not linger in the past and then she wad rewarded for her hard work by being reunited with the parents. Here there is literally no reason to feel anything for Moana and Maoi was the one that I found more memorable although still pretty simple and at the end very forgettable. The songs also were bad, it felt like watching some operett written by elementary school students. The opening song wad OK and you're welcome also was a bit of fun but the rest were just uninspired deliverance of lines on a bad rhythm and bland melody. At the end ""fight"" where the ocean was literally helping Moana I was wondering why didn't the ocean fix the problem itself. There was literally no reason for Moana to be dragged into this whole mess. When you think of some of the best animations out this year you have Kubo and two strings, you have Zootopia and then you have this movie. If you were to look back only a few years you would see that Moana will not even stand at top 10 let alone anywhere near the top. A shame since Moana could have been much better. Disney needs to work harder on its animations. Just compare this to Mulan or Princess and the frog and you see the gap in storytelling quality is too wide"
" I will only say: It is true Walt Disney movie
",0.4215,0.9984,2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"I don't know about the rest of people writing reviews here, but I am older generation of ""kids"" :) I remember when Disney was at his prime, and their movies ware fun, entertaining, full of joy and good singalong songs. For a long time, Disney was not that...new-generation directors, storytellers, cartoon artists and many others lost touch with old traditional good movies. They experimented with different styles of telling stories, but there was not successful in that, and Disney lost that charm that it had. This movie returned me my young self, with all the songs, breathtaking and funny moments. You go through roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to the end of movie, and it is so perfectly composed into one great unity.I agree, there ware some songs and tones of movie that ware kinda out of place, but you ""survive"" it, and already in next scene, you forgot about it, and you can enjoy in new incredible views that this movie provides.When I first heard of main casting, I was a little skeptical of ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, because, I was under the impression that Hollywood is pushing him into a lot of movies, just to earn more money, and this was one of them. BUT, although he is GREAT actor (proven him self a lot of times), he was PERFECT for this part. He is ""Maui"", he was so merged with that character, you can envision him in movie.As for the technical aspect of animation, there can only be words of praise and great-job-done! Water, hair, colors, hand-body and rest of movement ware so good done, that it could be said it is lifelike.All in all, I love that Disney decided to return to it's roots, and brought us warm-clich√©-loving movies that we all appreciate and need. There are new generation kids that need this kind of movies, because, we are drowning in too much reality shows, dramas, tragedy's and shallow-minded ""comedies"". For me, a great movie is the one that is re-watchable again and again, and whenever it comes to TV, you sit and watch it again, and not the movies that after once watched, you never come back and watch it again. This one goes to RE-WATCHABLE category. Thank you Disney."

First of all , it's the magic of Disney. To cultivate the culture of Polynesian , I have never seen it on big screen and it was magical. It made me want to go out to that place and enjoy the rich culture of such wonderful people. I don't know why Moana couldn't earn as much as others , still a huge hit. Starting from the story itself , it's adventurous and full of mythical elements and so close to nature. The Characters well Moana is my Favorite Disney Princess (sorry Elsa)just because early Disney Princess have always played it along their comfort zone and they knew what they are doing but Moana is all about finding about yourself , the journey of knowing your true self. Dwayne The Rock as Maui is instantly likable and humorous. The Best thing about this movie is the voice of Auli'i Cravalho and the soundtrack by Lin Manuel Miranda. The songs especially How Far I'll Go and We Know the Way Captures what this story is all about. Disney is making such great films this way. On one hand where pixar is more about hitting the heart and maturity Disney is the one and especially through this film , it is the one that reminds me of what Disney movies are like, just plain Magic. Many people believe animated movies are for kids but hey I am 18 year old man and I can't stop praising this movie. Forget about the Direction or Script it is the magical impact that Moana lefts us behind which is the best part of this movie. Also the last time I saw female lead actually play the female lead in a movie was Hidden Figures so hats off to that too. Towards the end as it was ending I didn't wanted it to end. Based on such rich themes the end for me was PERFECT in every way I could imagine and Disney managed to put a very strong message about Environment through this which is also amazing. One more thing is the much modernized and ver nice quality animation.Every leaf, ever drop of eater , every strand of hair is crafted with much details which clearly shows the hard work of so many hours. As speaking for Oscars , there is stiff competition From Zootopia as well as City of Stars from La La Land but for me it's already the best of the year.Go on Disney Make more movies like this with such awesome soundtrack. I also hope Lin Manuel Miranda gets the much deserving MacPEGOT (He has MacArthur Foundation , Pulitzer , Emmy , Grammy and Tony) so only Oscar is left . I do hope he wins for How Far I'll go.Well Even if he doesn't he is starring in Mary Poppins returns , and Giving Music for The Little Mermaid among others so it's a win- win for him. Finally, MOANA is one of those self discoveries about oneself that needs to be watched, it's epic it's SIMPLY CLASSIC."

Had long expected to see this movie, viewed several trailers, I thought this was going to be about how awesome a demigod would look like(personally I think it would be interesting) by fighting around monsters and saving the world.But Moana is not just about heart-beating awesomeness(though this is definitely one of the reasons why you must see the movie!), and massive visual effects. When Moana explores the sea, she is also exploring her long-living dream! The music sung by heart, with her soul beyond that endless ocean... Since the beginning of the movie, your heart is grasped, your breath is taken away, you forget who you are, why you are here--But you are here, together with the child, exploring both of your dreams--To make your dream come true! An adventure is never enough, without knowing why you are on this adventure and why you must be. Every minute I watched the movie, I was getting inspired and moved, how beautiful a movie Moana was! The characters are so vivid, I did not find anyone that was replaceable, even pets, and they are even critical factors to Moana's success.And again, what an amazing story, if you have not seen it, what are you waiting for?"

I think a lot of them miss the mark and can only remain interesting for children. A good animated feature is inclusive of a widespread audience and can remain smart and engaging will offering fun and crafty animation. Moana is not something I was looking forward to, as on paper it didn't look like it was going to leave much of an impression on me. It's safe to say that I'm surprised that this film was honestly pretty good.The first thing that I think deserves praise is the music. Nearly every song is excellent, catchy, and just so full of life. It's hard not to sing along to the music. This isn't exactly something I can say for a lot of animated films. The more technical aspect of the film is great. The colors are very vibrant and the animation is vivid and expansive (just like the vast ocean the heroes sail). Some of the action is eye-popping and very striking, especially the battle with the lava demon, Te Ka. Auli'i Cravalho is a relative newcomer who does a very good job of bringing Moana to life. She will probably have many more voice acting roles in the future.I also think the film is a good look into a culture that many people won't be familiar with. I've noticed that Disney is really trying to focus on some minority groups in the past few years and this is perfectly good for fresh inspiration. In the case of Moana, this provided for an interesting and unfamiliar setting and story, which adds to the films overall appeal. I'm well aware of the cultural criticisms this film received for the portrayal of Maui and the lack of heroine goddesses. However, its good to leave some criticisms at the door. If you look hard enough a criticism can be found for anything and its unnecessary for a film that means well.The film has its typical Disney clich√©s. You have the ""chosen"" hero who is unsure of themselves. You have the relationship with a buddy that is at first strained but then leads to the characters liking each other. There is a falling out and reunion with the hero discovering their ability. The film treads familiar Disney ground. Its not a terrible thing and kids won't really give a damn about it. Its not a flawless film, at its core its a familiar formula but I think the cultural aspect and imaginative visuals put a good balance.I think Kubo and the Two Strings was far and away the best animated film of the year and proved why Laika are ahead of the curve. I'd say Moana is better than some of its animated counterparts in the year, such as Zootopia and Finding Dory. I still long for the days of 90s Disney films but this effort shows that they are still trying at least. If for nothing else, sit back and enjoy the excellent music and visuals in the film.7.5/10"

Although Moana was a wonderful film with exciting action sequences, lovable characters, and catchy tunes thanks to Lin Manuel-Miranda's more modern approach to music, it somehow lacks the movie magic that Disney used to constantly deliver on in the past. However, if you truly enjoy films like Tangled, Frozen, or Brave, then Moana is definitely the movie for you. Moana is still lighthearted, fun, and of course delivers a valuable message to anyone looking for strength. You and your kids are sure to get some enjoyment out of this film."
" Moana ShowMeTheMovies Review
",0.0,0.9916,2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"Disney's new animated presentation from the creator's of Frozen had a great deal to live up to - and surpassed every expectation.Many of Disney's past animated films with musical aspects have always often irritated me in different ways - I never thought Tangled was great, and Frozen was simply obnoxious to watch. I'm very much aware that my opinion is much against the tide of the rest of the world, particularly with Frozen and its ridiculously famous Let it Go leading track, which I didn't even consider enjoyable either.Considering the opinion that I hold on animated Disney (except Pixar, they are exceptional 80% of the time) I thought that Moana would sit as a 5/10 at best, considering Disney are very talented at sticking to a formula that makes money: but I couldn't have been more wrong. Naturally, Moana certainly does fit into this same formula, and it certainly will have made a very sizeable profit, but despite this the film was incredibly enjoyable regardless.The overall plot is quite typical of any animated kid's movie as a whole, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is a girl who lives on an ancient island which is becoming affected by a curse - fish begin to die, villagers start worrying about food etc - and Moana believes that the solution to her problems lies beyond the reef, away from her island, where no one has allegedly been before. Her father is the chief of the tribe that reside on the island, and wants Moana to take his place when she is of age, so he is very much opposed to the idea of her travelling away from the island.This all lines up to the generic overbearing-parent/adventurous-child dynamic, where Moana longs to travel, and her father is desperate to keep her restricted to the island during the entirety of her childhood. This isn't exactly pushing the boat out (I'm funny) when it comes to an original plot, and when Moana eventually leaves the island with the encouragement of her Grandmother, the real adventure begins.What is absolutely worth mentioning is the music, since How Far I'll Go was nominated for a Golden Globe (and likely will be for an Oscar) for best original song. While La La Land took the award, this track deserved its spot on the nominees list at least, as this is a Disney song which is not only listenable, but enjoyable and - and this is important - leagues above Let it Go. It's clear the creators of Moana understood that this song would really be a hit, since they reprise the song two or three times more during the film, which does make it a bit stale by the end - but Cravalho's voice seems perfect for not only voice acting as Moana, but also in performing How Far I'll Go.There are other original tracks in the film, Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) does perform as well, but none of them resonated as much as the main track. However, other than the song that he performs, Maui was absolutely my favourite character in the film. This is far and away Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's best presentation in any film, playing a demi-god who has caused the curse that Moana's island is affected by, mainly through his own ignorance. And that's what Maui is during the time you meet the character; an ignorant, self-absorbed moron who is too focused on his own image to actually help anyone using the status he possesses as a demi-god. Moana attempts to find him to try and fix the curse, and Maui is our reluctant hero in this adventure.What I really loved about Maui is that there is absolutely no reason for him to be so full of himself, he is stripped of his shapeshifting abilities when Moana discovers him, and he has essentially caused all of the problems that he and Moana face during the film, yet his ego is still huge, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's execution makes this somewhat charming. The relationship that Moana has with him is naturally quite rocky (I'm very funny) to begin with; Moana tries to command Maui to fix the curse and Maui tries to leave Moana to rot on an island and steals her boat. Despite this, they do work together during the film and their relationship grows to a point of admiration and empathy of one another - without spoiling anything. The actors clearly work in conjunction very well, and Maui was one of the main reasons I really enjoyed this movie.Overall, Moana is incredibly enjoyable, even if it follows the typical Disney formula. The plot may have been particularly generic, but every performance in the film really hit a high note and the animation style, while Disney's usual, still had moments of spectacle. Even for a children's movie, I would wholeheartedly recommend this film to any child or adult, because either demographic will likely find this film really entertaining."
" My prejudices included
",-0.4215,0.914,2017-01-15 00:00:00,2,"I want to upfront admit that my prejudices are included in my views of Moana. First the Italian film of the same name from the last decade is a fave of mine. The legs, the breasts, the long hair and of course the realness ah I can smell the wonderful enchantress. Second like many of my buds I too am a lover of the famous porn star whether it is Moana's straight sex scenes, the more exotic ones with the dwarfs or the group action we love Moana. Indeed when we got together this weekend to have some brew and watch some porn on the big screen there was no doubt which Moana real red blooded men prefer. With that said, I took my brat and bratess to watch Disney's Moana and was somewhat bored. I wonder if my little man will grow up a real man's man or become a wussy Disney fan, but he watched it and did it quietly. My princess thought it wasn't good like Frozen so keep that in mind. As for different cultures and stuff I am no expert and in the new America that belongs to President Donald Trump who friggin cares(supposedly the spirit of her grandmother appearing and her falling down the hole have cultural meaning), but fact remains that the name Moana is not an attractive one as if someone wants to hear a woman moan anywhere. Be super thin, have long hair and cook and all is alright. Be your own woman and be a feminist lamestream fan and we got issues. Anwyay, it is available at your local multiplex for $10 per adult or $7 for little ones."
" Beyond Expectations
",0.0,0.9887,2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"I am reviewing this film because it did something unprecedented: It invested me. I seriously wanted Moana to succeed and to know what would happen next. I even got choked during the scene where the grandmother's ghost appears despite it obviously being cribbed from Lion King. This is the first Disney movie that I, as an adult and not a kid, enjoyed as it is. With many Disney movies I found that the protagonists' minds were not explored enough; here, I felt we got to know the characters sufficiently. After the disaster that was Frozen, this is a great relief. However, I am used to feeling smarter than Disney movies, so I feel defeated by liking this. I feel more defeated still by liking the songs since Lin Manuel Miranda, whose personality I REALLY resent, had a hand in writing them. I totally predicted that the volcano spirit was really the island goddess. The plot was quite reminiscent of Lion King and Little Mermaid, but at least there's no romance. It is clear whoever writes these movies are becoming more aware of what people think of them, which results in some really funny moments. Oh, yeah, I was legitimately laughing at this! My favorite moments both involved Maui a) when Moana falls all that way down and he says ""Well, she's dead."" That was my exact thought before he said it. The screenwriter must watch Cinema Sins. My other favorite moment was when he said ""If you're going to sing, I'm gonna throw up."" Nice to have a little cynicism in a Disney movie.Last but not least, the film looks breathtaking. I really wanted to be in these settings, especially the demonic coral reef world. Everything looks so photographically real, yet more vivid than life. Maybe Moana is what taking drugs at the beach is like. In conclusion, this is top-notch entertainment for you and/or your kids."

" A New Timeless Classic From Disney
",0.0,0.998,2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Moana is the latest in a slew of CG animated movies from Disney, with Tangled, Frozen, and Zootopia preceding it, so needless to say I had some very high expectations for Moana. Were they fulfilled? Absolutely!Let's talk about the characters first. Moana, the teenage daughter of the village Chief, who wants nothing more than to leave her island and explore the sea, but can't because her father won't let her, but the plants start dying and the fish disappear, she takes it upon herself to go out to sea, find the demigod, Maui, and restore the heart of Te Fiti to restore her village. I have a new favorite Disney princess. Moana is an absurdly likable and relatable character who never plays the role of the typical, annoying, immature teenager. I liken her to being kind of like Ariel, from The Little Mermaid, but much better written. Maui, the powerful demigod who has lost his magic fishhook, is a complete jerk and I love him for it. Dwayne Johnson's undeniable charm and humor shines through even in this arrogant, selfish, and egotistical character. Speaking of performances, this is the debut of an outstanding new talent in Auli'i Cravalho. She absolutely kills it as Moana, not only standing alongside Dwayne Johnson, but even sometimes outperforming him. I really do hope for a very successful career for this incredibly talented young actress. Did I mention her singing voice?The music in Moana is also amazing. Lin-Manuel Miranda composes this movie to perfection. I could listen to this soundtrack all day, though two songs in particular stand out: How Far I'll Go and You're Welcome. These are arguably some of the best songs to come out of Disney in the past 20 years. Now to talk about the aesthetic qualities. This is one of the most beautiful animated movies I have ever seen. Everything seems so vibrant and alive, it seems magical, which any proper Disney picture should be.Overall, I had a great time watching Moana. I think it has a good message, very likable characters, a phenomenal soundtrack, and gorgeous visuals. Don't miss this one.The End"

Disney could also hire Consultants from the Natives who still are there telling those histories!!!

" A typical Disney princess story without the prince...
",0.0,0.9961,2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Disney did it again, an amended princess story. Queuing into the load of critics, I may not add spectacular insights, but summarize my opinion for those who are undecided to see Moana in the cinema or not.Let's keep it short and simple. Moana (Vaiana in Austria and Germany) starts a world rescue mission within her mythical world of Maoris and Oceania in the best possible way. Disobeying her father the chief she starts a visually beautiful journey to help her people with the support of a likable demigod, sweet or funny sidekicks and not always comprehensible reasons within the story. As usual, the ""princess"" of the island sings her way through mythical creatures and magic tricks. So far so good, but unfortunately nothing new.Let's take the ocean scenario away and agree on the key argument the creators spread in every interview, namely there is no romance as main motivation. OK, that's fine, but still I have seen this story a dozen times.What does it mean for you? Just that you see Merida, Arielle or what have you in a new disguise. New but similar songs, new but similar characters and new but similar characters. It's up to you to decide if you prefer sailing between the islands or riding a horse in the Scottish highlands. So Moana is a well-made, funny and nice feel good movie, but nothing you don't know yet.As a result, decide on the trailer. Do you like the scenario, then go for it but don't expect a big Disney surprise."
" Good but not very memorable.
",0.2382,0.9959,2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"""Moana"" it's Disney's latest film that brigs us a new tale involving Polynesian culture. The film it's directed by Rob Clements and John Musker, both have been working with Disney for a long time, and they have brought us some very good films, like ""The Great Mouse Detective"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"" and more. But there seems to be something missing in ""Moana"", the film itself it's quite good but fails to captivate it's audience or surprise them with anything new. It doesn't take any chances, and it's not very memorable.The best element in the film it's the animation, but it's Disney, so I was expecting that the animation would at least be mesmerizing to me, the voice acting it's quite good too, the Spanish dub it's very well made but it has something lacking, maybe the translation was very difficult for them, so they forced a few words into the script or the song lyrics, which it's expected when you translate musicals.The characters are fleshed out pretty well, there isn't one unlikeable character in the film, there isn't even a villain, and I like that, but when it comes to characters I would say that some of them, like the rooster, are useless and forgettable, they are only there as a comedic relief, another flaw it's that the character motivations are not very solid, and they could have used a bit more time to flesh them out, but I would say that the finished product it's quite decent. It has a few issues with it's directing and pacing, sometimes it goes very fast and doesn't let the moment sink in for you to actually feel for the characters, but those moments don't last very long and they aren't badly made overall.The songs are quite good, very catchy and quite riveting, they did a very good job at balancing them, the film it's quite entertaining, it isn't boring, it's actually quite engaging, and it's quite sad at moments, it made me feel very nostalgic for those days when I would watch a Disney film with my cousins and enjoy them with the mindset of a child, ready for new adventures with each tale Disney's films brought us.I would say that children will like this movie, but the parents are the ones that will truly enjoy the film for it's merits and filmmaking itself, but it's quite far from great.Overall, I definitely recommend this film, maybe it will do wonders for you, I am not very pleased with the final result, but I can't say that it was bad."
" Typical Disney fare
",0.0,0.9919,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"EDIT: Fixed a couple of grammatical errors, elaborated a bit in one section.Let me be honest with you: there have only really been 3 Disney movies in this year and 10 years included and before it that really made me go ""Wow! They DIDN'T just pull another Disney here"". I say that very rarely because Disney has a particular formula that they know works and will give them loads of money... and BOY do they use it allot. If you don't believe me, think for a second: besides Wreck it Ralph, Zootopia, and Big Hero 6, what other PURE Disney (in no association with Pixar) animated movies HAVEN'T had numerous musical numbers, a female lead, a male supporting role, a comedic relief character, and some big journey to stop something bad from happening to the place that the main character lives in?I know it sounds oddly specific, but it's been played so many times by Disney that's actually more mundane at this point. You've seen in in allot of their hits, and by the next, you probably go into the theater telling yourself the same thing as the last: ""I'm ready for the new masterpiece!"". Moana is just another one of these films. Is it well written? Yes! Is it culturally diverse? Why would it not be? Is the animation beautiful and breathtaking at moments? Again, the answer is a resounding YES. While all those things are a saving grace for the film, the biggest issue I have in my mind with it is that I will probably forget it's existence in the years to come, Oscar, Golden Globe, WHATEVER, or not! Moana is excellently produced, but none of that matters to me when the writing and overall story arc basically amount to clich√©s that have been beaten to death already. ""Oh,"" I can hear you saying, ""but they mock those cliches, therefore it's original!"" Satire and self-loathing have been around for years. When it comes to the former, there's a line between making fun of something and indulging in the exact thing you're aiming to mock. Moana dives head first into the latter.Listen, if you LOVE Disney and couldn't give a Rat's Tail about these clich√©s, go ahead and go see the film, you'll probably love it because it's Disney. That said, however, if you DO care for more than a small amount of originality like I do, then maybe it's worth a rental, but that's about it. Again, Moana is excellently produced and will most likely leave a smile on your face... but it's also a convincing case study for all the clich√©s Disney has been stuffing into their films as of late."

",0.0,0.9984,2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"In recent years it seems like digital animation is becoming more and more advanced with each movie being released. But the changes are gradual and often expected. We talk about how the scenery looks just like a photograph, or how animals look like they could be real. However, actual humanity is the one thing that seems to be taking the longest to become lifelike. This is where Moana comes in.While still maintaining that cartoon-like feel, this is the first time where actual human characters' emotions look real. In the past, expressions take on very on-the-nose clich√©s. Not necessarily over-the-top, but just very obvious. Here, we get facial expressions that look just like yours and mine. It's eerie. It helps us feel for the characters more--especially when it comes to our title character.Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho) is a teenager growing up on the Polynesian island of Motunui and longs to explore the ocean. However, her father, Chief Tui, forbids her to leave. The one rule they have on the island is that they cannot go beyond the reef. But Moana is stubborn. Even as the island's resources are running out, she resiliently tries to persuade her father, but to no avail.Her grandmother gives her a small magical stone known as the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. A thousand years prior, demigod, Maui (Dwayne Johnson), stole the heart, which is causing each island, one by one, to dry up. Moana sets out to find Maui so he can return the heart to the goddess.Disney churns out a solid formula piece with Moana. This is a criticism in some respect. But it can also work to its advantage. The general storyline doesn't really give us any sort of new beats. A girl sets off to do something that we all know she will probably end up accomplishing. We foresee each false victory before it occurs. It starts out predictable and pulls from countless of its Disney predecessors. But it does one thing that's very unusual for a Disney film--it lacks romance of any kind. The two protagonists--of opposite sex--have a strictly platonic relationship. Love isn't the point of the film at all. It's so ingrained in our expectations that it catches us off guard and we are constantly reminding ourselves that the movie isn't about that.Moana is a captivating protagonist. Whether or not the writing makes her that way. The animation is just that good. There is one musical sequence where they backdrop the characters against a relatively primitive animated background, which has become an ordinary device used in countless films before. But upon looking at the canvas, it almost seems like it has been thrown into a live-action film. In past instances, there wasn't as much of a discrepancy, but now the juxtaposition shows just how far we've come with animation.I could gush for paragraphs about the visuals of this movie. But that would only end up overshadowing the film's other strength--its music.Lin-Manuel Miranda writes some brilliantly catchy songs--perhaps the best, pound-for-pound, in recent Disney musical history. From the refreshingly bright islandy ""Where You Are"" to the macabre Bowie-inspired ""Shiny"", each track hits hard and becomes addicting. All except for Maui's solo piece, ""You're Welcome."" It's Dwayne Johnson's only song and is marginal at best. The others are creative and take melodic turns that you never expect, but this one falls into the basic realm of uninspired, perhaps best appreciated by your toddler child. It merely goes through the motions, and only appears worse amidst its brilliant companions.The songs may be fantastic, but the dialogue is curiously weak, and unfortunately separates Moana from the past Disney bunch. At times it feels like it was written by a teenager--or perhaps someone who wanted to sound like one. The comedy gets childish in a couple of instances, though, to its credit, quickly snaps back. Then there's Maui's character, who can grate on you a bit. His shtick is a little too colloquial and his jokes often fall flat.But the film heads in the right direction overall. Often times going one step back and two steps forward. It nicely sticks to its narrative with Moana's perspective, and never seems to be challenged by it.The story could have been merely a device to flex its aesthetic guns (it's not), but it would have all been worth it just to experience the beauty of what's on screen. Here, the movie isn't just telling a story, but creating a full experience--something unexpectedly rare these days.Twizard Rating: 92"

With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film."
" A beautiful movie but not exactly ground-breaking
",0.3506,0.9941,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Another wonderful movie to add to the Disney classics. The film stars the daughter of a chief who sets of on journey to save her island. She journeys to find Maui, a mischievous block of tattooed muscles, I mean demigod, to help her save the world. They bond, fight, laugh and save the world with the help of the dumbest chicken you have ever met. The film doesn't exactly break boundaries, break from its typical story lines, explore mature themes or entertain adults the same way it can children. There are a lot animations that do this and Moana isn't one of them. I think this is the main reason people can't appreciate Moana. But WOW! It certainly leaves you feeling all chipper and sing-songy.It's an utterly beautiful, light hearted (with an occasional tear jerker) and humorous film. If you don't like Frozen, Big Hero 6 or Finding Dory please don't watch. This is a movie I will recommend to anyone and everyone because its definitely in Disneys top 10 out of what...like 200 films. For people who are complaining about plot and character dev. Please stop. Disney has worked to the bone to avoid cultural appropriation and misrepresentation whilst offering a visually stunning, humorous and adventurous plot. Sorry, if they didn't include that plot twist you were salivating for.Its get 10/10 instead 9/10 because I enjoyed this movie too much."
" A Cultural Experience
",0.0,0.9382,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Despite the tedious amount of singing throughout the film, Moana (2016) revealed to an audience of a widely unknown culture through an animated story. Maui, voiced my Dwayne Johnson shows an alteration for the persona of his character as well as impacting the very story in which he plays one of the main protagonists. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) however opens the audience to a realm of hope, duty, and resilience in which has great application to her character within this culturally defined film. Overall the mix of personalities throughout the film, as well as the adventurous tone allows Moana (2016) to be an experience worth watching."
" Moana Leads us on a Fun Adventure
",0.6808,0.9838,2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Earlier this year, Elizabeth posted an article looking forward to the movie Moana. Despite the aggressively mediocre trailers that Disney had put out, she was excited for the film, and her excitement proved to be well-placed. Moana delivered far more than the lack luster trailers promised.The film follows Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), a spunky princess who leaves her island to embark on an epic quest to return the stolen heart of the Goddess Te Fiti. After forming an alliance with the Demigod Maui (Dwayne the Rock Johnson), the two set off across the seas to find the Goddess. Along they way there are many adventures including a run-in with a giant crab voiced by Jemaine Clement, a lot of laughs, and a whole lot of fantastic music.While the story in Moana isn't revolutionary, Disney is pushing some new ground in other areas. The animation is beautiful, much of the cast and music was created by artists from Pacific Islands (although it was still directed by a couple white guys), Moana is a strong female character drawn in realistic human proportions, and most refreshingly of all there was no love story. While I love Disney's recent push towards less misogynistic films, it seems odd to applaud them for starting to break down stereotypes that they created. Don't get me wrong, Moana is an awesome heroine, but It's sad that we applaud Disney for creating a strong female character who can stand on her own. That should be the expectation, and anything else, anything that hearkens back to the early days of Disney princesses needs to be rejected. There are many many reasons to commend Moana aside from its lack of misogyny. The beautiful animation, the killer score from Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina, and Opetaia Foa'i, the consistent jokes, and the stellar voice work add up to an extremely fun movie. Moana doesn't quite stack up to the heights that Disney reached earlier this year with Zootopia, but If you're looking for a pick me up after 2016, this is the movie to grab."
