" Doesn't make sense. Why would he just leave his wife along amoung his enemies
",-0.5267,-0.7017,2018-11-19 00:00:00,1,"Our beloved Bollywood never surprise me in there stupidity of writing. I mean really why would Rustom leave his wife alone in the company of his enemies with out giving any warning or just telling her to stay away from them.I mean he got posted and he just left. Imagine. On Italian for you """"IDIIiOoooTtaaa"""""
" Poor character of Illiana
",-0.4767,-0.7294,2018-09-01 00:00:00,2,Iliana looked like a village girl that she was baited and she ate it. In Indian culture in 1969 a wife of whatever status wouldn't meet strangers in this manner that ended up going to bed. She had this illegal relationship and she went there herself later on. Strangely Akhay didn't alert his wife that something could happen to get from Vikram. Very average story!
" Don't miss this suspense movie
",0.1139,0.891,2018-08-25 00:00:00,10,This is what we called a suspense courtroom drama in true sense. Akshay is awesome as always and his chemistry with Illeana is perfect.
" A decent movie where the one who wins is a people's guy!
",0.6114,0.981,2018-08-08 00:00:00,7,"Tone, Script & Story: The story is inspired from one of the true stories of an officer that existed in 1959. What is it about? Well it is for killing the lover of his (Officer's) wife.How much of it is inspired, or how much of it is real, well if we consider just the movie, it is quite an entertainer. I have already watched it three times and I never got bored.In the original story there, there is no mention of corrupt officials in navy. Thus when such a thing came to light in movie version it was difficult for me to accept. I however after googling found such things existed in defense as well if not earlier than sure in modern days one form or other.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: Very good. The songs complement the movie. My favorite track is 'Tere Sang Yaara' followed by 'Dekha Hazora Dafa'. Acting: Everybody was justified.Final Verdict: Don't go searching for the reality that occurred, go for a decent movie. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
" Do not miss this one!
",0.1867,0.5673,2018-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Four things that jar to me:1. The towel that doesn't come off the deceased in the first encounter shown between him and the killer, despite a gladiator-like brawl between them. 
2. The overtly ""order-in-the-courtroom"" barking and gavel-rapping judge, who otherwise was perfect in his role.
3. Jurors getting ""physical"" in their deliberations (really?) 
4. How the Commander could have forced the delivery of the aircraft carrier on his terms when really he had played all his cards by then?Otherwise, all loose plot ends are neatly tied towards the end (pay particular attention to the stills that run just before the credits) Do not, I repeat, do not miss this movie.It's a darn good one.Akshay, you're still Khilladi No. 1 :)"
" Too much Masala !!
",0.0,0.9456,2017-07-29 00:00:00,6,"I always tell a good film is like a good dish. It should be well cooked and should have a prefect blend of spices, salt and sugar.Rustom is film spoilt by as say in Hindi, too much Masala.Firstly, hats off to Akshay Kumar and his team to make a film on the Nanavati trial which ended India's jury trial system. Its a beautiful case which changed the legal system in India.But the problem here is that there is too much focus put on the aesthetics and less on the story. Also, trying to put a Naval Scam angle to the story didn't make me happy because the Nanavati case is brilliant itself.Also, the writing is a let down in many places. The courtroom scenes are a joke. After watching Pink last year where we saw some mindblowing scenes, this is pure unintentional comedy.Coming to the performances, Akshay Kumar is in fine form and the only reason to watch this film. He plays the accused in a very dignified manner and doesn't get over the top. But this is not National Award winning stuff let me make that clear.Illeana does no justice to her character. She only weeps and weeps and we never understand why she cheated on her loving husband. And Esha Gupta gets one meaty role but hams it up. Her lack of acting skills are visible and she can't play the vamp to perfection. I wish someone like Kareena or Priyanka could have played this role. Other aspects of the film are fine and it is definitely worth one watch."
" nice movie
",0.4215,-0.8779,2017-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Cynthia gets home to a drunk, angry-yet-calm Rustom; a storm in the offing. Rustom goes to Vikram's place, armed with a pistol from the armoury. Three shots are heard from Vikram's bedroom. The servant runs upstairs to find Rustom standing over a dead Vikram, pistol in hand. Much like the KM Nanavati case, Rustom then goes to the police station and turns himself in. Senior inspector Lobo is shocked. The case reaches the court. Rustom the film is more a courtroom drama than a thriller. The film draws heavily from the Nanavati case. Right from people selling the 'Rustom pistol' and the 'Vikram towel - marne pe bhi nahi girte hai' outside the court to the self-defence vs pre-mediated murder arguments. Desai packs in every element possible of the late-50s/early-60s Bombay in Rustom."
" nice movie
",0.4215,0.9784,2017-05-16 00:00:00,9,"The unblemished character of Commander Rustom Pavri - he is a decorated officer celebrated for his devotion to duty - remains untouched by the complexities of a bitter legal contest or the nuances of a marriage gone sour. Not interested in exploring the frailties that the flesh is heir to, Rustom opts for a facile and melodramatic approach to the 1959 murder case. The handsomely mounted but anodyne film plays out like a straightforward old school good-versus-evil tale in which the truly righteous are allowed a transgression or two in the face of provocation. Every character in the film struts around like a vainglorious clothes horse. Rustom Pavri, the man in the dock, always sports his spotless white naval uniform. Even when he is off duty and in police custody, he is a picture of sartorial poise. His stressed-out wife, despite the serious crisis in her life, is never less than impeccable in her choice of sarees and blouses. The vamp, like all good old vamps, dons western outfits and carries a slender cigarette holder as if it were an extension of her lips, a la Marlene Dietrich. And suave investigating officer Vincent Lobo (Pavan Malhotra, who, as always, makes an impression that rises above the weaknesses of the film) is never caught without his starched buttoned-down shirt, black tie and pleated trousers as he goes about the job of establishing Rustom's guilt."
" nice movie
",0.4215,-0.4019,2017-05-16 00:00:00,9,"Rustom is bound to be a full-on treat. The courtroom drama is scripted, crafted and geared to give the lead actor all the space that he needs in order to own the project. The star of the show proves equal to the task. Unfortunately, Rustom, which fictionalizes the sensational true story of naval officer Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati, comes nowhere near becoming an irresistible cinematic account of a murder trial. Written by Vipul K Rawal and directed by Tinu Suresh Desai, Rustom is a strangely bland film that throws more thematic strands into its narrative wicker basket than it can hold - heroism of a man in uniform, marital discord, culpable homicide and legal twists and turns. An apocryphal aircraft carrier scam involving the high and mighty is added to the broth to lend the hero the sheen of a crusader. The first time the audience sees the film's titular figure, he emerges from a naval vessel's engine room and strides out in style to the deck of the ship. There is no way anybody can miss the national flag fluttering in the background."

Outstanding performance by the crew specially Akshya Kumar who has done his best performance as he done in other movies, other two actresses have made a huge contribution to make the movie a thriller for the audiences. And remaining the suspense made in the story throughout the movie is well. This type of movies is the best part of the entertainment of audience. I really appreciate this movie"

",0.4215,-0.024,2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"You smell a rat right away. It's at the entry of the naval officer hero Rustom Pavri (Akshay Kumar) framed against the tricolour fluttering away in the background. Director Tinu Suresh Desai reinterprets the (in)famous K.M. Nanavati case of yore and builds a popular conspiracy theory around it in the spirit of today's uber- patriotic times, quite conveniently at that. Kumar, plays the Nanavati figure while Ileana D' Cruz is Cynthia (the philandering Sylvia from real life) and Arjun Bajwa plays Vikram Makhija (the playboy Prem Ahuja). ""Kuchh to hai jo pakad mein nahin aa raha hai (There is something that one is unable to figure out),"" says the investigating cop Vincent Lobo (Pavan Malhotra) at some point. However, any marginally intelligent viewer would know where things are heading. Even though, the film itself very consciously tries to make a big deal of how much more there is to this seemingly simple, open and shut case of betrayal, jealousy and revenge"

The tour finishes before time, and Rustom returns to find Cynthia in the arms of a hot-headed millionaire, Vikram Makhija (Arjan Bajwa).Akshay Kumar has aced the art of presenting thrillers with patriotic tone. (Twitter) Rustom's raging anger knows no bounds, and Vikram is killed. The officer decides to fight his own case, and cleverly places his pawns. The local media shows tremendous interest in his personality. But there's still a long way before he can present the case as a crime of passion instead of cold-blooded murder."

The society's idea of infidelity and consenting adults are likely to impact the final outcome.It's early 1960s and the Indian navy is making its presence felt in the Arabian Sea. Men in uniform command respect, and envy. Added to that, Rustom is from an affluent class in an economically struggling country.Though part of the story is based on fact, it's the relationship drama that actually makes this a thriller. It's a juicy retro story given more panache with a voice-over by Manoj Bajpayee, who introduces us to Mumbai's Queen's Necklace in sepia.Rustom is another feather in Akshay Kumar's cap. (YouTube) The premise is fairly simple. Director Tinu Desai's characters reveal themselves rather obviously: A heartbroken naval officer, his cheating wife, the Casanova lover, his evil sister, sympathetic cops, an ambitious reporter and an overtly confused jury. But, slowly and surely, the movie grips you."
" nice movie
",0.4215,-0.8146,2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"The movie watching experience of 'Rustom' is very different as compared to other films that take you back to the 60's. Directed by Tinu Suresh Desai, the movie is unique on multiple levels for some of the genuine efforts that he has put in and deserves a mention. Be it the use of vintage cars, the interiors of Rustom's ( Akshay Kumar) Parsi house, the set up of a police station or even the courtroom, they all look believable. Yes, but in few scenes projecting old Bombay roads in the background, the VFX is poor and it could have been much better.The movie brings to life, famous the K M Nanavati Murder case that got nationwide attention in 1959. The film is not a 100 percent accurate reflection of the case as the makers have taken some cinematic liberties. But it does bring to light the court room drama and the attention this case got all across the nation and the public sympathy the naval officer got.Rustom Pavri, a decorated naval officer, finds out about his wife Cynthia's ( Ileana D'Cruz) affair with a hot headed businessman Vikram Makhika played by Arjun Bajwa. After an honest confession by Cynthia, Rustom is completely shattered by her revelation. He heads straight to Vikram's house and murders him in cold blood by firing three shots in close range. Preeti, Vikram's sister (Esha Gupta) decide to go after Rustom till he is put behind bars."
" nice movie
",0.4215,-0.6333,2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"This makes way for a courtroom drama that gets spectators, supporters and haters all assemble eagerly at the court to catch every glimpse of the case. A glimpse of women carrying a board which reads 'Marry me Rustom' is also shown in the film.Written by Vipul K Rawal, the movie has a clear intention of entertaining the audiences. Believe it or not, the most intense scenes in the court room have been turned around into a comic affair. While this works in some scenes, it falls flat as it mostly comes across as over-dependent. The comical relief has its strength but it also takes away the seriousness of the film. The dialogues given to Preeti, for the courtroom scenes, are very out of sync for a character who is mourning the death of her brother."
" nice movie
",0.4215,0.8126,2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"The infamous 1959 Nanavati case had spawned a couple of early films, neither of which came close to the lurid excitement of the real- life incident which involved a handsome naval officer, his lovely-but-lonely wife, and her lover, and a sensational murder. And yet both Yeh Raaste Hain Pyar Ke and Achanak bear a stronger allegiance to the Nanavati case than Akshay Kumar's Rustom, which borrows the core idea, and then adds a layer of extra intrigue. The idea may have been to spice up an already spicy plot, but the result is dilution, and it doesn't work in the favour of the film."
" nice movie
",0.4215,-0.9859,2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"The lover is a cad who deserves to die, not because he sleeps with the wife, but because he is a greedy, corrupt 'gaddar', consorting with shady white people and an even shadier deal. And the naval officer may have wielded the gun that caused the fellow to die, but he is no murderer: how can Akshay the Hero be a weak killer? That really is the weakest spot of the film, despite its leading man trying hard to fill his part with star appeal. In its zeal to make Akshay's character noble, the script papers over his human weakness: the first time he appears, on board his ship, resplendent in his white, decorated uniform, it is an old-style 'entry'. It instantly deadens the film which should have taken Akshay into a braver, rockier terrain than he has inhabited till now. In Airlift, he showed how he could take a quasi-real part and run with it. The film, despite its many concessions to 'reality', worked because the star made sure he was believable. The only time we connect with Rustom is when we are allowed to see the anguish and pained resolve in Akshay's eyes."
" nice movie
",0.4215,0.9698,2017-05-15 00:00:00,9,"Akshay Kumar is the backbone of Rustom. The Khiladi renders one of the most understated performances of his career, proving yet again that he can play a range of diverse roles with aplomb. He smoothly pulls off his character with utmost ease.Based on a controversial case, Rustom lacks the unnerving tension one ideally expects from a film of this genre. However, director Tinu Suresh Desai infuses ample melodrama and ups the intrigue. Ileana D'Cruz is perfectly cast and does complete justice to her role. Arjan Bajwa is decent as well.To cut to the chase, Rustom can be watched for its story and most importantly Akshay Kumar, whose action/comic brilliance often overshadows his acting prowess. He reminds you to value the honest officers who serve our country with dignity and valour. He makes you want to support the man who probably did the right thing the wrong way."
" nice movie
",0.4215,0.607,2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Though the climax has been smartly fictionalised, this courtroom drama is essentially based on the real life of Naval officer K M Nanavati, who in 1959, shot and killed his wife's lover. The subsequent trial was one of India's most sensational court cases. Coming to the film, Rustom has a cracker of a beginning. Without wasting any time, the director comes straight to the point. He takes us quickly through the circumstances in which Rustom shoots Vikram and the trial begins."
" nice movie
",0.4215,0.8541,2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Forget that there is nothing remotely credible or engaging in the thriller. The film, in fact, feels like a parody of the several murder mysteries and court room dramas we have seen down the ages. And an unintentionally funny one at that. Some moments in the second half are truly priceless, especially those that are to do with an orange dressing gown and a precariously held white towel that refuses to slip down the waist. But, what is more irritating is the righteousness attributed to the killer protagonist – a virtuous Kumar, right down to the sanctimonious moustache and straight spine; then the overt guilt, perennially inclined head of Ileana and the talk of putting the Queen at stake in the game of chess, all for an eventual win. Add to that the ""desh ki raksha/hifazat"" angle and the double whammy of machismo of the Navy man—in the aid of the nation and the woman—and it gets way too smug for comfort. Kumar wrests the moral high ground, as a man, a husband and a much decorated officer. And the janta approves."
" Based on a true story means some liberties were taken, no need to judge harshly for that
",0.5994,0.9754,2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Loosely based on the Late Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati, a Commander in the Indian Navy. Do not worry I just googled it. Based on a true story means some liberties were taken, no need to judge harshly for that. Otherwise the 50s atmosphere was great. The chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Ileana D'Cruz was excellent despite the age difference. We must face facts the double standards for men and women in film regarding age was always there and it should change now. This was the only real problem I had. The cheesy egotistical air some characters had was a tad bit annoying but the drama in the courtroom was done well. There is a little suspense as well however please excuse the comedy, I enjoyed that but maybe you may not. Overall though an entertaining film if a little inaccurate."
" This movie is horrible
",-0.5423,0.9872,2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"The story dates back to the late 1950s and revolves around an Indian Naval Officer Rustom Pavri (Akshay Kumar), who is happily married to Cynthia Pavri (Ileana D'Cruz). Their marriage hits the rocks when Rustom discovers about his wife's affair with his friend Vikram Makhija (Arjan Bajwa). After returning early from his ship's deployment, Rustom discovers Vikram's love letters in Cynthia's cupboard. While trying to find her, Rustom sees them together. He returns home and waits for Cynthia to return and then confronts her with the love letters, but walks away before Cynthia can explain. Rustom then gets himself a pistol from the Naval Ship's Armory and makes a Trunk call to Defence HQ, New Delhi. Afterwards, he searches for Vikram, first in his office and then at his home. After Rustom enters Vikram's bedroom, the servant hears three gun shots and rushes to the room, to discover Vikram's body in a pool of blood and Rustom walking away with the pistol in his hand. Rustom immediately surrenders to the police and Inspector Vincent Lobo (Pawan Malhotra) starts the investigation.Vikram's sister Priti Makhija (Esha Gupta) hires the best lawyer in the city, Lakshman Khangani (Sachin Khedekar) to get Rustom the toughest punishment possible. Truth, a local newspaper, publishes the news adding some spice to it, which creates a stir in the city. On the one side the Navy supports its officer and asks the police to hand over his custody to them while on the other side the Parsi community offers help by hiring a good defense lawyer. Rustom refuses everybody's help and decides to fight the case on his own and prefers police custody. While the Editor in Chief of Truth, Erich Billimoria (Kumud Mishra), creates a sympathetic image for Rustom in public, Rustom's senior Naval officer Rear Admiral Prashant Kamat (Parmeet Sethi) sends two goons to his house to search for a set of documents, but they fail to find anything. Scared, Cynthia rushes to jail to inform Rustom, who hasn't talked to her ever since he is in custody. Rustom finally meets and listens to Cynthia's story, about how she was lonely and upset when Rustom went away to London for many months. With the connivance of Priti, Vikram took advantage of Cynthia's loneliness and she fell for him. However, on the day of Vikram's murder, Cynthia had already broken-up with him for the sake of her marriage. Vikram cannot bear her spurning him and slaps her hard. She gets injured and walks out of Vikram's house.On Rustom's instructions, Cynthia blackmails Rear Admiral Prashant Kamat for Rs 5 crore in exchange for the vital documents he needed. In the court hearing, Rustom unexpectedly pleads not guilty in front of the Judge Patel (Anang Desai), which leads to a 9-member jury trial. At the culmination of the trial, Rustom is found not guilty by the jury since he shot Vikram in ""self defence"".In the meanwhile it is found that Vincent Lobo was in Delhi and he had met the defence office secretary to get the recording of the trunk call that Rustom had made. When back in Bombay the trunk call is played everyone thinks that Rustom is guilty and the court proceedings end for the jury to decide on their opinion.In the police station on the night of the court proceeding Rustom tells Vincent Lobo the truth that he had a posting in London for many months for checking an aircraft carrier but on making reports it was found by Rustom that the carrier was rusted from inside and it could only be brought to India if it was modified first.Then Vikram was supposed to be in charge for the aircraft carrier.When Rustom goes to the Defence secretary in London they want to bribe him of money and get the carrier to India. Vikram persuades him and Rustom then slaps him showing his power of his uniform. The next day it is shown that Rustom is proved not guilty by the jury and he walks free.Then it is shown in the flashback that Vikram had dated Cynthia to show Rustom his power of money and take revenge of the slap but not for her beauty. Lobo is said that Rustom did not reveal about the aircraft carrier as then everyone would think the navy to be corrupt and then not believe in them just because of few officers. Rustom and Cynthia walk out of the court with their heads held up high and then the film roles into the credits."
" Distortion of facts. Would have worked better if advertised as pure fiction
",0.4404,0.9878,2017-01-07 00:00:00,2,"The infamous Nanavati case has inspired couple of Bollywood movies in full and many in parts over the years.Rustom advertised as another inspiration is the latest addition and turns out to be no different than its predecessor.A distorted, fictional account with only frame similarities with the actual incident with lots of Massala and added flavors that end up making it just another exaggerated Bollywood flick. Bollywood has never been competent enough to portray real incidents on its merit and has traditionally always relied on eccentric counter stories, jingoism, nationalism to make a mockery of what may have really happened.It could have been an excellent opportunity to do justice to the Nanavati story by staying loyal to the actual story since the movies made in the past on this subject have not been able to do thatSo you have the character based on Nanavati fighting his own case, the cop playing chess with KM Nanavati in lock up, Jury screaming and arguing with each other as if they are sitting 500 meters apart and many many more instances when you feel your are watching just another Bollywood masala movie. The biggest distortion comes in with the Nationalist and Corruption angle in the story when there was none.Screaming eccentric witnesses add to the agony.The production team has done an equally bad job as the house interiors, loud bright colours and sets look like a 2015's idea of 1959 rather than what 1959 would actually have been.A brilliant opportunity wasted. It could have stayed true to the case, been more subtle and could have become a truly international classic.A major disappointment because the KM Nanavati Case by itself is so interesting and holds a historical importance in history of Indian Justice System for being the last time when a Jury decided a case. It marked a landmark change in the process because it was concluded that Jury could be influenced by cultural upbringing and be emotional while deciding on a case and thus could be a loophole for future convicts.The only Bollywood movie that has stayed true to history is Black Friday on 1993 Mumbai bombings and hence is very well respected in international circuit. Its a pity, this movie could have well attained that stature because the truth itself was so meaty that it did not require it to depend on fiction to make it interesting.Sigh ..........."
" Ridiculous
",-0.3612,-0.5777,2017-01-06 00:00:00,2,"Bad acting, melodrama, weak plot, poor characterisation, pathetic script , boring music and the general senselessness that pervades the whole movie make it unwatchable. Trying to cash in on the wave of neo(read pseudo) nationalism , Rustom fails miserably. Akshay Kumar acts like a Robot from 70's sci-fi flicks. Esha Gupta looks like she she has been asked to model for Kingfisher Premium and dishes out ridiculously mismatched expressions throughout the movie.Most of the supporting cast follows suit . In fact the overacting is nauseous.To top it all is the nonsensical story. A pathetic mix of infidelity, patriotism, jingoism and gender relationships that reminds one of outlawed sensibilities .The movie is so crass that at times one feels like laughing at the comic elements in the movie not because they are funny but because they are so stupid . It is almost unbelievable that a movie like this came out .If I were to sum up the movie I would say it is a boring film with no saving grace . Please don't waste you time or money on this one."
