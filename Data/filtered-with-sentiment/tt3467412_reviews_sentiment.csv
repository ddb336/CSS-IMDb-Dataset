" Postapocalyptic melodrama
",0.0,-0.8811,2021-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Pros:
-The best character was dog.-The concept of where they're surviving and how the infected people are evolving and adapting the environment is interesting, but the whole movie is ruined by all the cringe worthy melodrama.-The infected are cool; it's obvious that Miguel √Ångel Rivas (the director) was inspired by Guillermo del Toro's vampires.Cons:
-The relationships between the characters are so idiotic and cringy that I often rooted for all of the 3 main characters to be gone.-They are adults yet they behave like hormonal snowflakes.-The child is veeeeery spoiled.-They gave the poor dog alcohol to drink and chocolate cookies (you should never give chocolate to dogs) as food, wtf!"
" Greatttt movie
",0.0,0.9162,2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,I love the concept of the movie and even the creatures in it. Great post apocalyptic movie. The little girl in the movie is extremely talented. Just great Saturday and Sunday morning/afternoon movie.
" Utterly unwatchable shaky cam
",-0.2911,-0.9057,2021-01-22 00:00:00,2,"I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. Honestly, my time is too valuable to waste on garbage like this. So is yours.The first two minutes are promising. Tension. Mystery. Why did the bus stop?! Then they hit you dead-center in the face with the worst shaky cam and editing that I've seen in ten years. If you were violently thrown around in a washing machine that itself is inside a tornado or an earthquake, you would have a more stable picture than this.To make it worse, you don't get more than half a second of a frame before it's cut and you are shown something else.Whomever thinks this pathetic style of film making is great, should never be allowed to touch another device with a ""record"" button on it.Avoid. Utter and total garbage by amateur film makers hiding their lack of skills behind ""cool"" shaky cam and microsecond editing."
" Insultingly Bad
",-0.7783,-0.9846,2021-01-22 00:00:00,3,"I love zombie movies, and appreciate fresh takes on the genre. However, the pointless and glaringly obvious errors and nonsensical events just say ""lazy writing.""After ""something bad happens"" to a bus full of people and two heavily armed military men, wtf would you OPEN THE DOORS and not just drive the bus away??? There's no real sense of urgency, and the ""look out"" somehow misses the monster that runs right up to them.Aside from that, it's apparently winter all the time? Only explanation for murder/suicide bodies to be left intact and not decomposed after years.Girl sees a monster DIGGING UNDER THEIR FENCE, and not only doesn't mention the breech to her Dad, he never notices the huge hole either. Even later, when it's obvious the monsters are back, still nothing. Then, she goes OUTSIDE, at NIGHT, through the gaping hole, to put plastic flowers on a dog grave. UGH.Neighbor doesn't mention that monsters are blind and hunt by sound, which would be helpful to know when fighting them off.Gasoline goes bad after just a few months/years. Wth does all the fuel come from for the generator, truck, and snowmobile?!!? There's a windmill, that never moves in all the snow, why isn't it working to generate power? Wth did the battery for the truck that's been sitting for years come from? How are is it not just frozen solid after sitting all that time???It's supposedly freezing cold, all the time, so no idea where the wild herbivore animals (non-hibernating rabbit, horse) find things to eat.Zombies wearing underpants? Really??? WHY?There are no other kids around, where does the girl get ideas about what is and isn't appropriate for her age? Too old for dolls? Who cares?!Speaking of cold... as my Mom would say ""WERE YOU ALL BORN IN A BARN???"" They are CONSTANTLY leaving doors wide open, day and night. Gathering fuel to burn to heat those homes would require HUGE amounts of energy = calories = food = additional foraging =even more work. Leaving doors open like that, having uncovered single pane windows, etc is just plain stupid, and serves no purpose. Not that there's even a basic attempt to make it really appear cold. No frosted breath, no snow on actors after being outside.Monsters INSIDE THE WALLS??? Which movie
is this? Because anyone who has ever seen the inside of an actual wall knows how stupid this idea is. Builders don't waste valuable materials, space, and effort building in huge dead spaces inside walls unless they're perverts, serial killers, bootleggers, or smuggling slaves to freedom.Finally- Wtf is up with the ending?! What are they looking at? A sunrise? A working city? A space ship? Disneyland? Who knows! Nine years and apparently they never found a short wave radio that should have allowed them to contact people hundreds, or even thousands of miles away... instead just one person only 50 miles away.I knkw we are all dredging the bottom of our watch lists 11 months into this pandemic, but this one still isn't worth it. Go watch a classic, or short indie film collection. Or the inside of your eyelids instead."

" Interesting perspective but poor script and plotting
",-0.5106,-0.959,2021-01-17 00:00:00,4,"This is an interesting take on a zombie apocalypse, but the story inside the film becomes overwhelmed by melodramtic elements that derail movement and tension in the film. Another aspect that weighs the film down is the rather tired and standard domestic elements in the film are so overdone in general that even in this setting they are still boring. Special effects are of low quality, including the rather horrid hair and beard on Fox. Tired tropes, melodrama, and rehashing standard elements in a slightly new presentation left me wondering why I was watching the film."
" The forecast for tonight is cold
",0.0,-0.5293,2021-01-16 00:00:00,4,"Extinction is your typical zombie survival horror. It has an underwhelming introduction of a zombie apocalypse which looks and feels a like you are watching a cutscene of a video game. After the opening sequence the film really grinds on and just about puts you to sleep with it's heavily drawn out character development.After what seems like an eternity we finally get some glimpses of action with a little bit of suspense. And all this happens from the halfway of point the film. You'll be absolutely begging never to have to sit through the first forty or fifty minutes ever again.The undead seemed to have evolved within the harsh icy environment and so they look pale, with slick grey skin to blend in and survive in the cold. The way they move, run and climb on all fours makes them very animalistic. I found them almost resembling a Wendigo from the game Until Dawn.Jack (Jeffrey Donovan) and Patrick (Matthew Fox) live next door to one another however both men don't communicate whatsoever due to a issue that has occurred in their past. They both live in separate properties that are barricaded with a tall barbed wire fence to resemble something of a prison and further enhance the isolation theme.The little girl Lu (Quinn McColgan) is significant throughout the story as is her relationship with Jack. There is also a nice twist in the later stages of the film involving the three. A lost woman Anne (Clara Lago Grau) is introduced just to change up the character dynamics, but it doesn't quite do enough to bring this film to life.The film ends very cliche and I must say even though It felt different from other zombie movies, It was nothing special. The whole first half of the film is the major issue with it taking too long to establish the resentment between Jack and Patrick. There isn't a whole lot of zombie appearances and just not enough tense moments (I jumped literally once close to the end).One final note is that we are supposed to believe that the story is set in a post apocalyptic world for at least the past nine years. I ask a question, and that is we see what looks like a new box of fruit loops shown at the table, and then Jack pours them into a bowl for Lu who starts eating them while they look quite fresh. Surely there is an expiration date? Where did they find them? I mean how stale would they be after nine years?I just had to add this final point as when watching these types of films for me it is something that stands out which immediately takes away some of the believability during that early stage of the film.4/10"
" Good Movie With Minor Script Issues.
",0.4404,-0.7571,2020-12-21 00:00:00,6,"This movie is very emotional and keeps you on the edge of your seat.The only issues I have with the script is at the start of the film. In the beginning the military seems to be escorting survivors of a pandemic that turned people into rabid infectious flesh eating mutants. There were two different buses that halted in the middle of the street. When military personnel on the following bus witness and hear gun fire from military personnel on the leading bus. Here comes the issue: the military men on the following bus radio to the bus infront of them after the gun fire, without a response. Any logical train of thought would've came to the conclusion that everyone was dead on the bus ahead of them. Knowing this, the military personnel on the following bus (which consisted of two men) requested for the driver to open the bus door. When he does one of the two military personnel goes outside and doesn't return for some time. Then the remaining military man requests the driver open the door so he can see what's going on. MAJOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE! This is the only issue I have with the films script.Other than the shaky beginning, the film is quite well done. The characters are adaptable and have solid background and connections to one another.I would've easily gave this movie a 7/8 if it wasn't for the start. I recommend it for a watch or two. Not bad."
" Appreciate it
",0.4019,0.9609,2020-12-08 00:00:00,7,"Cool zombie flicks have become few and far between. This was a suprise. It was done well, looked of quality and had good CGI. Yes, story could've been better in a couple things you can argue about. But if your wanting a good solid zombie movie in the snow with just enough subplot to keep it entertaining check it out. I added it to my zombie collection. Enjoy!"
" Baffled
",0.0,0.3626,2020-12-02 00:00:00,4,"As I am writing this review, this movie has a 5.9 on IMDb. The only thing more baffling than that fact is the lack of care that went into creating this gorebage. If this movie were a road and plot holes were potholes, it would be unable to be driven on. The lack of care that went into creating this film is just disrespectful to the audience. I will not watch movies that are below a 6.0 on IMDb. This one was right at the cusp of a 6.0 so I gave it a shot and thoroughly regret it. This movie is the equivalent of a rebound partner after a long relationship. Just something you want to forget ever happened."
" A very confused mess of a film. The tag line for this review is ""awful"".
",-0.6566,-0.6972,2020-11-25 00:00:00,1,"Frankly awful. Awful effects, awful unlikeable characters, an awful regard to animals and children, an awful confused plot that just wanders around a bit.Awful. I can only hope it gets better after the first hour, because I couldn't cope with the second half given how badly the directing and plot and content sat with me.For the record, I LOVE a good zombie film."
" Good drama, make sure to watch past the first 15 minutes
",0.6369,0.9923,2020-11-20 00:00:00,7,"When I began watching this I thought, oh no not another low budget zombie film. But after the first scene on the bus with the human looking zombies it takes a massive turn for the better with the bulk of the film being set in a wonderfully desolate, snowy town. In all honesty I could have done without the bus zombie attack sequence.Where this film really shines is its brilliant cinematography, there's a fabulous shot of a man killing a deer with a rifle then we see the man reflected in the dying deer's glassy eye before delivering the final blow with a low camera angle shot. There's also lots of brilliant wide shots of the environment and sunrises and the such.The acting is quite good, Lu played by the young Quinn McColgan is a great child actor and Matthew Fox and Jeffrey Donovan put up admirable performances too. Another area for praise is the makeup and special effects, the evolved zombies (not the silly human looking zombies from the start) look distorted and freakish with elongated limbs and sharp teeth; very well done indeed!7/10: Falters a bit at the start and has a rather disappointing ending but is still 100% worth a watch"

" A Zombie Movie, but bring the Kleenex
",0.0,0.9469,2020-07-20 00:00:00,9,"This film is more about redemption, forgiveness, and self-sacrifice than it is about brain-eating zombies. The writing, acting, and directing is very tight and focused. The action parts are few, but their impact is not wasted. A very heart wrenching scene serves as the climax to a well delivered drama horror hybrid. As a bonus, the films score is superb and is worth your time long after the movie ends."

",0.3818,-0.4215,2020-02-22 00:00:00,3,"I don't understand why the slow burn of a movie, presenting an atmosphere to tell an intimate story, is thrown away for a resolution in the third act that made the movie indistinguishable of plenty of others zombie movies. But also worse because of the budget. I just don't get it.Little to say. With a better script, the director would've been able to sold us on an intimate and little human story, because even if slow, I found the first half well done. Apparently, wrong story to do it."
" Freaky monsters! Good story!
",0.2462,-0.9399,2020-02-09 00:00:00,7,"The beginning of this movie had me thinking it was going to be another poorly done, chaotic zombie flick. Fast forward several years into the future, and we have a solid script, quality acting from the cast, and a cold, dreary post apocalyptic back drop in the countryside. The story is dramatic and personal, and moves at a steady pace. The evolved, mutated zombies are above average, and more freaky than repulsive. There are a handful of good scares, and the ending wasn't quite so dismal as films of this type tend to be. Definitely worth a watch if you're into a balanced film that has a little more plot, a little less gore."

" MY FRIEND FLICKA
",0.4939,-0.9342,2019-04-28 00:00:00,6,"After an unnamed disaster there is an apparent viral infection that creates zombies and most likely is associated with the prolonged ""nuclear?"" style winter (Comet with alien infection?) After a brief ""I don't think that's a good idea"" we end up 9 years later with prudish Jack (Jeffrey Donovan) and young Lu (Quinn McColgan) living in one house while his ex-friend Patrick (Matthew Fox) lives across the street, each one surviving on their own.Eventually we get to the spoiler on the DVD cover when evolved zombies attack. Not only do we never find out caused the event, the film is a little fuzzy on the event with Emma (Valeria Vereau) the dead wife and the apparent episode that lead to 9 years of separation of the two friends. I was expecting one more flashback to make thing crystal clear, but it never happened.I liked the idea that it broke the zombie mode. I didn't like the lack of characters at the end of the world. Jack and Patrick lacked charisma and I would have never created a story around such dry characters.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Not amazing but pretty watchable
",-0.6681,0.5911,2019-04-21 00:00:00,7,"I think perhaps the fact this is termed a zombie movie puts people in the wrong frame of mind for it.In reality there isnt a whole lot of your traditional zombie fighting movie in this, the zombies are more of an ever present threat in the background on top of which a human drama is playing out.The drama is really the main point of the movie and its about two men and a little girl and the impacts of being imperfect people but trying to do their best for the girl.Its not a bad movie, definitely watchable, just dont expect tons of zombie action there isnt an enormous amount of that."

" Movies like this need to be extinct
",0.3612,-0.9991,2018-12-29 00:00:00,1,"Another zombie movie. Yeah but unlike some of the others out there this one was really vague on what it was about. We kept getting fed little crumbs of backstory but never enough to know why or how the zombies came to be and we never got to know exactly what the backstory was in the love triangle. And when it ends you aren't really sure where they end up nor do you know if they are finally safe nor do you know if they are planning on trying to find other people. It just ends with them staring at the sun. It's a real head scratcher.Let's break this down shall we? So in the beginning two busloads full of people are being transported by the military somewhere (not sure exactly where or why but moving on) the first bus stops abruptly and the bus behind it (carrying the main characters) starts to get uneasy. Two soldiers get off the second bus in succession after failing to get anyone from the first bus to respond to them via walkie talkie. The first soldier never comes back and the second soldier gets attacked by a zombie. Now here's the part where a logical person might start to panic slightly and decide they should maybe think about taking off in the bus in order to avoid the fate that has befallen the first bus and the two soldiers...you'd think that right? Well not these folks. They just stay on the bus and wait for one passenger (Jeffrey Donovan) to venture outside to get the soldier's guns. He gets attacked and still no one does anything. They wait until the zombies start breaking into the bus to begin their panic. And even then they're just kind of waiting their turn to get attacked. No one tries to escape until it's basically too late. Some folks do get out but instead of running away they just kind of stand around and wait to get attacked.Jeffrey Donovan (who was so good in Burn Notice but in this movie basically just stands around a lot with his mouth open) Matthew Fox (who hasn't done anything since 2015-what happened to him?!) and Valeria Vereau (who is Matthew's wife? Girlfriend? Not sure) who is holding a baby that we find out later is Matthew's, were on the second bus until all hell breaks loose (how they all came to be on that bus together or how they all know one another is never revealed). They manage to get away but while Valeria is hiding she gets bit by a zombie. Matthew and Jeffrey show up (which where were they up until that point?! Why didn't they stick together?!) and they realize that Valeria has been bitten. In flashbacks later we see that she survived after Matthew cut off her infected arm.Next thing we see is the screen telling us it's 9 years later. We see snowy terrain and come to find out that Matthew lives next door to Jeffrey who is now raising Matthew's daughter (Quinn McColgen who I realized after the movie was over basically carried the film and out acted the two seasoned vets and this speaks to how bad Matthew & Jeffrey were because Quinn wasn't exactly turning in an Oscar winning performance) Even though they are the only people they know who are alive they don't speak to one another. Through flashbacks we find out that Matthew is a drunk (Why? That's not explained either) who gets angry with Valeria because I'm guessing she slept with Jeffrey? He walks out on her while she's trying to talk to him about the situation while they are at a warehouse/store loading up on groceries (which miraculously has enough food to last them the past 9 years). She gets in the truck after Matthew abandons her and a zombie attacks and kills her.Next we see Matthew on the floor drinking and Jeffrey comes into the room. The baby is crying from neglect and Matthew asks what happened. Jeffrey tells him that he left Valeria and now she's dead and also he's taking the baby because Matthew has failed to take care of her.Now a normal person would at some point take their child back or try to interact with it somehow but not Matthew. He just lets Jeffrey take his daughter and never once tried to make amends or get her back even though they live right next door to one another. Matthew can't take care of his daughter but he has a dog he's awfully fond of-we aren't told how he came to have this dog...it's just there.One day when Matthew is making a food run he comes upon a zombie who tries to attack him. He gets away but the zombie follows him. He crashes his snowmobile and the zombie attacks him but he manages to stave it off. He gets back on his mobile and heads back home while giving the alert to Jeffrey by shooting his gun. Jeffrey comes out and sees Matthew get attacked yet again and raises his gun to shoot yet ultimately doesn't. Matthew's dog comes outta nowhere and tries to get the zombie away from Matthew but alas the dog gets bit and dies. Jeffrey does nothing. Matthew is distraught.Matthew doesn't turn into a zombie after getting bit and he somehow heals but he starts hearing a man talk to him through the radio and the man encourages him to kill Jeffrey. It was very confusing because that was never explained. Is he starting to hear voices because he got bit? Why did he stop hearing the voices after a certain point? That really needed more explanation.After some time passes Quinn invites Matthew over for dinner. Jeffrey seems to be OK with this and they seem to come to some type of detente during the meal; but then Jeffrey changes his mind and says it was a bad idea and tells Matthew to leave.Eventually they decide they have to work together to get through this second wave of zombies coming through. Matthew says that he thinks he can get a truck to work so they can try to leave to find others (which I was thinking ""So you had nine years of your truck just sitting there but NOW all of a sudden you think you can get it to work?!"" That was another miracle especially because it just shows them getting into the truck and Matthew starting it - you don't see him working on it...nothing-it's just been sitting there in the freezing cold and starts right up like a champ.) They all go into town and while there they see a woman in distress. She's in shock so they take her back to their house and discover she's pregnant. She tells them that she was with her family but they were attacked by the zombies and she got away.Next thing you know the zombies are starting to attack their house. They all get their guns and Jeffrey tells the daughter to go in the basement (which in hindsight was a really dumb idea because while she was down there she almost got attacked by a zombie that somehow made its way into the basement and also why did the basement have so much water in it?)They realize they're not going to be able to fight off all the zombies so Matthew tells them that he will provide a distraction so they can get away-thus sacrificing himself to which Jeffrey offers no resistance (I mean really dude?! That's the child's father and you were having an affair with your friend's wife but hey whatever just let HIM be the one to die and don't try to stop him) but not before there's a flashback scene of Matthew with his wife kissing her pregnant belly and saying how he couldn't wait to meet the daughter). After leading the zombies away he lights a fuse and blows up the area. He dies with a smile on his face.Jeffrey, the pregnant lady and the daughter all get away. They stop after awhile and get out of the truck and stand looking out at the sun over a valley of God knows what...we don't know if they have found another village of people, we don't know if they're just looking at the sun before they continue on their journey, we don't know if the zombies are all gone now, we don't know anything.And that's it. I don't even know if I can say this had potential or that it was good in parts because Matthew & Jeffrey were terrible in this.Zombie movies are stupid in general but this is definitely one that you should avoid. It's a long slog through this one too...takes forever for anything to happen or be interesting. All that for no payoff in the end. This movie must have shamed Matthew Fox so much he had to quit Hollywood because he hasn't done anything since 2015. Maybe the zombies got him after all? Too bad they didn't take Jeffrey with them."

" Don't let the zombies deter you from this human drama
",0.0,0.1535,2018-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Extinction is more a drama than a zombie flick, which sadly means it's a quite difficult movie to sell. There's not enough ""zombie action"" to satisfy fans of that genre, and the whole zombie apocalypse backdrop might deter people interested in watching a deeper human story from watching it.
That said, after an extremely cliched zombie apocalypse opening, it quickly turns into a small, personal drama that deals more with the problems of seclusion and human complexity than the zombies. All of this is well done with well acted and fleshed out characters, and a direction and cinematography that emphasizes the intimacy a movie like this needs to get us involved.
All is not perfect, though. There is a beginning of a sub-plot involving delusions that is promptly forgotten, which was a bit jarring, and some character decisions (especially in the opening) that are questionable, as well as a situation where the movie seems to forget how many zombies are present, but when all is said and done this was a very enjoyable drama that just happens to have some zombies in it, and could be described as a very good episode of The Walking Dead (of which there aren't that many) stretched out to feature length."

",-0.3167,0.4391,2018-09-18 00:00:00,7,"I don't have much to say. The other reviews are all correct. Go in with low expectations, and you will leave very impressed. This film is more of a mystery than a scifi or zombie film. Zombies are in it, of course, and they are very evil. The creatures are done very well compared to the vast majority of other zombie flicks.. OOPS, there i go again. This is NOT a zombie flick. This is a scary dramatic mystery with a powerful story. Watch it. I promise you will enjoy."

are not yet extinct.
I expected an another alien invasion with the intent to extinct the human race but
then at the last moment an american teenage boy will come up with some smart
technology to defeat and outsmart the space travel aliens.
Surprisingly it turned out that humanized suppressed robots in a classic postmodern society
fighting against alienated humans who are trying to get earth back as its property.
The conservative and sensitive robot workers, first starting as low class worker in the human society are the clear heroes in this movie.Anyhow, meanwhile we are dreaming of ours greatness and now trying to create ""AI"" and robots like mythical gods we have extinct around 20 unique species just by today."
" These zombies are coool
",0.0,-0.9973,2018-08-14 00:00:00,2,"Okay, so first of all I do commend the director and writers for trying something different in the zombie genre, but along the way they stumble through many zombie cliches. 
The film opens on a convoy of survivors trying to get to Harmony, a fictitious city. I'm assuming it's fictional because I don't remember any cities so far north to have perpetual blizzards and yet also skyscrapers (observe poorly designed and obviously fake backdrops in the early shots of the film), seriously it snows all the time, did the zombie outbreak also change the weather? (Actually that's probably a better film idea than this one deserves.) 
Anywho, after an extremely inane action sequence to explain ""how we got here"" (that includes multiple silent stealthy deaths by a large crowd of screaming zombies), we learn in the present the main characters hate each other for some reason and dummy A (I will refer to them as such for the remainder of the review for obvious reasons shortly explained) takes care of dummy B's daughter and raises her as his own because ""he ain't right"" according to dummy A, or some such reasoning to shut up a ""daughter"" he treats like utter garbage in an apocalyptic situation (seriously, I get he's trying to be stern but it's a world where 99.9999% of the earth was eaten, including her mom, lighten up dude).
So, yeah, in a world of complete destruction and death, the only two people that they know of are choosing to be little babies and are feuding like warring neighbors in a FREAKING ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE! Are you kidding me? I'm led to believe in a world of almost all dead that they wouldn't put such things aside, for the sake of the baby girl they are trying to raise?
The movie trudges on, more dumbness, dummy A watches dummy B nearly die ""cuz feud"", then dummy B has a subplot where voices in his head tell him to kill people (okay?), dummy A invites dummy B to dinner, ruined ""cuz feud"", etc. (side note: the director was obviously a HUGE fan of ""The Walking Dead"" due to multiple ripoffs, from limb hacking to avoid zombie infection, to ""hit everything then hit nothing"" good guy aim).
We learn the zombies are back and evolving, now they are blind but they hear good. (Not sure how that's a evolutionary possible since evolution is to make a species better hunters, not worse, and they haven't been living underground.) For some reason this makes them...worse? Not sure why? They also no longer spread infection. Sweet. For some reason a pretty lady shows up to be pretty and talk about a survivor story. Seems condoms must be zombie food, otherwise I can't explain why you wouldn't use protection in a zombie apocalypse. Seriously, this is a world to raise a child? Maybe wait until after the cannibals are gone, 'kay? 
Yep, she's pregnant. Although that subplot means absolutely nothing, other than showin some belly it's never referenced in the movie again. 
So dummy B decided to cut up the first Uber zombie they met and keep it as a dog or something because pretty lady sees it and rightly shoots it dead because these suckers are pack hunters and he's been calling his buddies for a few days. Seriously, these guys are so dumb. How did they survive 9 years let alone 9 minutes?!
Pretty lady is the only smart character, she informs them they are all dead meat, and they await the horde. The child gets unexplainably locked up in the basement so her dad can keep her outside of his view, safe in such situations I know. Things go bad, then well when the characters realize sound is bad (sidenote #2 : Did John K. from ""The Office"" get drunk and watch this movie and that's where ""A Quiet Place"" came from? Seriously, it has sound hunting monsters with wicked ears, who are killed by sound, and includes a Dad who dies at the end to save his kid....o crap.) and play some classic rock to mess the zombies up. Works until the generator that has been (conveniently blasting music day and night for weeks) conveniently dies, mid zombie battle. Nice. 
Dummy B decides to be a hero and lead away sound hunting zombies using his fleshy body instead of, ya know, throwing a rock or something. He gets Rambo'ed by God and shoots everything easily until he forgets to grab a sidearm or any extra bullets and gets eaten and dies and blows up. In that order. (Somewhere along the lines we learned Dummy B is the real dad of the child but he was a drunk and let mom die so dummy A raised the baby, this was an act of self sacrifice to atone for being an idiot. Didn't work. Still dumb.)
Movie ends, mercifully for the audience."
" Aliens? With human faces?!!!!
",0.0,-0.8378,2018-07-27 00:00:00,2,"Alien and other species invading our planet! I adore these movies but this one was utterly ridiculous! Concern over aliens having votes on government issues in our society, living amongst us? Having 'rights'? Simply ludicrous!!! The acting was so over the top from both the children, their parents and the human-alien was diabolical!!! I watched this silly movie on Netflix and it's given me more reasons why I should unsubscribe! Bonkers!!!! Not worthy of 1 star but I've given it 2 simply because I felt sorry for the 2 children and their parents for the fees it cost for these children to attend drama classes! Diabolical!!!!"
" More about human relationships than zombies
",0.0,-0.9562,2018-06-15 00:00:00,6,"This didn't start off too promising for me - a zombie attack on a bus load of passengers with lots of blurred, shaky cam (I hate that), indicating yet another zombie apocalypse movie (yawn, this has been done to death). But then it's fast forward 9 years to a frozen place called Harmony, where we find three survivors from the bus attack. Jack is living with a young girl called Lou, who refers to him as Dad. Next door is Patrick, a drunk who lives with his dog. They are no longer on speaking terms until events take a turn for the worse..
This film is a slow burn, it's more about the relationship between these three characters than the zombies (perhaps infected would be a better word to describe them). So it may put some horror fans off who may become impatient but I found the film to be well made, well acted and although it is quite predictable I was intrigued as to what was going to happen. One thing that I thought stupid however was that these creatures appear to be naked apart from wearing white pants!
If you like horror combined with drama then highly recommended; if you just want a zombie gorefest either get prepared to hit the FFWD button or give it a miss."
" Very immersive gem not to be missed
",0.2235,0.6203,2018-06-13 00:00:00,10,"When I saw this listed on the TV guide I thought, like most, *yawn* another zombie movie... but how wrong I was. The movie is a character tale with impressive acting and clever dialogue not to mention the detailed sets/locations. The opening scene immediately sets the tone for the film and you cannot help but emphasis with the characters. While watching I actually forget this was a zombie flick as I was so immersed in the lives of the 3 central characters. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie on so many levels."
" The apocalypse on a budget
",0.0,-0.8318,2018-05-14 00:00:00,5,"EXTINCTION is a cheap Hungarian zombie flick that goes for the post-apocalyptic vibe on what is obviously a tiny budget. The setting is a snowbound house, where survivors hole up a decade after an apocalypse wiped out mankind and replaced them with feral, super-fast flesh-eating creatures. The protagonists are a couple of rival guys and a kid and they spend most of the screen time either fighting or in an uneasy alliance. The horror aspects of the production turn out to be very limited, at least until the climax, and for the most part there's just one zombie on screen at a time. What I disliked about this film was the look - all dark, cold and blue, just like many modern digital horrors - and the fakeness of the CGI effects, which render all of the big stunt scenes quite laughable. The acting is okay and the story offers more structured characters than you typically see in this genre, but this is nothing to get excited about..."

" Decent watch, but the script needs polishing...
",0.0,-0.9777,2018-03-22 00:00:00,6,"I really liked the approach of going for a small-scale character driven zombie flick. The reviews seem to be very divided between masterpiece and if-I-could-give-zero kind of comments. In my opinion, the actual rating (5.8 right now) represents exactly the score this one deserves. And here's why:A lot in here is pretty decent: Atmosphere, camerawork, effects and the acting are all very good. Matthew Fox steals the show and I always like to see he's doing a movie every now and then. Jeffrey Donovan is also pretty good, although there were little moments where I didn't buy his part, but that's rather to blame on the directing, which sometimes is pretty good and other times rather mediocre. But then, the writing...It's not particularly bad but the way this story is structured it just falls flat in the end. I think if they had done two or more script revisions they really could have nailed it. And I'm not even talking about inconsistencies like a sequence in which the characters load up on TONS of weapons just so one of them only has a single bullet to fire when he finally needs to. No, I'm talking about setting up and tieing up the subplots properly.Let's start at the beginning: Two men, a woman and a baby get caught up in the Zombiecalypse. She gets bitten. The guys and the baby survive. Cut to: Nine years later. The two guys live way out yonder in two seperate houses in the mountains hating each other while one of them, Jack (Donovan), struggles to be a father for his now 9-year-old daughter and the other guy, Patrick (Fox), is a drunken bum. At this point we are being kept in the dark of what happened and which of those two is actually the real father, because both of them seem to have had a close relationship with that woman back then.SPOILERS:
Later, it turns out the woman didn't die at the beginning because they cut off her arm so she could live. Patrick is actually the girl's father and he used to live with his little family in one of those houses until he became jealous of Jack, accusing him and his wife of having an affair. So he picked up a drinking habit which led to him failing to save her in a critical situation and she died. Patrick hit rock bottom after that and Jack, who always had a crush on Patrick's wife, blames him for her death ever since. He took his daughter to take care of her because Patrick was just a complete failure. And that's where the movie starts.So far, so good. Makes for a great drama constellation but the problem is those pieces of information are only given to us as short flashback revelations whereas THIS should have been part of the main plot through the first half of the second act! It would have made a much better first half, especially in that apocalyptic and isolated environment.But after a tight and well paced opener it starts to drag pretty fast, with way to much running time spent on false father Jack and the girl and that the two men just hate each other with the audience wondering why and how that situation came about. Character-driven narration doesn't need twists and turns that are set up like in a mystery or whodunnit movie. So why not give that part of the story more room?The ending was pretty dissatisfying to me because they just killed off the wrong guy. At first, Jack seems to be a doer and overall stronger person than Patrick. Later we see him struggling with fatherhood, he doesn't want to leave the ""safe haven"", hell, he's even close to shooting his not-daughter and himself in a moment of desperation! Patrick on the other hand starts off as weak, then destroyed, and then even mentally disturbed. But he manages to climb out of his hole, stops drinking and becomes the doer in the end. That part of the writing is actually pretty compelling with their inversed character arcs, but then Patrick kills himself to rescue them and Jack who even tried to kill himself and the girl gets away looking into the sunset with his new family!Family? Oh yes, by the way, another woman who is also pregnant suddenly joins them close to the third act. I feel like she was written only for the last shot where the new ""family"" looks into the sun just to give the theme of false parenthood a visual. But from a story structure perspective her character was absolutely unnecessary. So the underlying message seems to be: A weak father with two children which aren't his own now takes care of that patchwork family without the children even knowing who their real fathers are. Was that intentional? I think the better ending would have been Jack, having become the weaker person over time, should have found redemption in sacrificing himself for the others, while Patrick, having found his strength, takes his rightful place as his daughter's father and saves her. That way it would have been a lot more satisfying. Okay, maybe a bit too formulaic and maybe the writers tried to really push for something unexpected but in this case it just didn't work out for me. It just felt wrong, especially since they never even tell the girl that Jack isn't her father. Ever!Too bad I have to sound so negative, I actually quite enjoyed this film. I really appreciate what the producers were going for and I definitely recommend watching it, just prepare to be a little disappointed in the end."

" Zombie Movie Having An Identity Crisis
",-0.6249,-0.5464,2017-03-26 00:00:00,5,"Extinction feels like a movie that can't decide what it wants to be. Zombie flick or a PG drama about a single Dad bringing up a child. Maybe the writer handed over some scribbled notes and then disappeared.The sets were all well done, with high level production values, but where's the damn story. NOTHING of any interest occurred for long sections at a time. Mostly centring around feeding the kid and listening to her whine. The first hour should have been compressed into 30 minutes.The tension between the men was confusing. Stringing out the audience can be effective if information is fed in appropriate chunks. But we actually need the clues before the end of the film if we're to draw conclusions early enough to care. The 'cliffhanger' wasn't pivotal to the story.On the plus side, I thought the Zombie was excellent. As a hybrid, evolving species it was a formidable hunter despite it's lack of sight. There are no explanations why it might be evolving in this way though. And something that bleeds before it has been injured will probably be weakened, not made stronger.Extinction is a slow film. The only reason a person of my tastes would watch it is for the unique Zombie footage."
" Extinction (2015)
",0.0,0.8065,2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,"Extinction (2015)The Zombie genre has pretty much in my opinion become ""DEAD ON ITS FEET"". Anyone with a camera is making low budget ""Zombie"" movies, it's truly killed this genre of horror for the most part. Then again, there have been some serious amazing Zombie films that have come out for us who have been itching for something truly original and lives up to its name. These films I am referring to are: ""28 days later"", ""pontypool"", ""rammbock"", ""dead girl"", ""Maggie"" & ""outpost"" to name a few...and now ""Extinction"" joins the ranks.If you are expecting a full out gore feast of epic proportions and just nameless killing...then please stop reading now. If you are wanting to see something original, smart, thought provoking and scary then continue reading.In all honesty, I almost missed out on this amazing gem of a film due to the clich√©d opening sequence. Allow me to explain, the film opens up in the midst of a ""Zombie Invasion"" and survivors are being loaded on buses and securely escorted into the safe zones. The opening sequence is quick, intense, and short lived. Thankfully, the writers and filmmakers were what they were doing when they fast forward us to years later... after the ""Apocalypse"". This is where the film really begins to shine. Horror movies, especially in THIS genre nowadays focus too much the shock value and gore aspect due to trying to ""succumbing to Hollywood cinematic stereotypes"" and lose what is REALLY important... The Human Element and the characters, so many films have so many gratuitous death scenes that the actors who portray them aren't even missed due to being nothing buy Cannon Fodder. Not here, here is the build up and this is where we meet our three main characters: Patrick (played by Matthew Fox of Party of Five and LOST fame) Jack (played by Jeffrey Donovan of Burn Notice) and Jack's daughter: Lu (played by Young Quinn McColgan known for her TV appearances such as Mildred Pierce & The Blacklist).Our three survivors are now seen living alone in a ""nuclear winter of snow"" due to the events that happened years earlier. The once friends now live as neighbors and live off the land and try to survive not only the elements but each other. The acting in this film is really top notch. As the tension builds between friends, terrifying events begin to unfold which involves young Lu thus forcing both men to overcome their somewhat petty differences and join up to help the one thing that is important to them - Lu.As the events continues to unfold they meet another female survivor played by Spanish actress, Clara Lago. This unlikely addition forms yet again another wedge between the two men, but that is soon rectified as they realize that the events surrounding Lu were only just the beginning of what would be the fight of their lives!!!"
