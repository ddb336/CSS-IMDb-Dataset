" A copycat killer is on the loose in Texarkana
",-0.765,0.9897,2021-03-19 00:00:00,6,"It has been 67 years since The Texarkana Moonlight Murders of 1946 and a new ""phantom killer"" surfaces with copycat attacks, usually occurring during ""lovers' lane"" scenarios.""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"" (2014) is not a remake of the 1976 B-flick, but rather a meta-sequel. It's best to see the original first (if you're not already acquainted with it) since there are so many references. This is a worthwhile companion-piece.To be expected, the filmmaking is all-around better, particularly the excellent color & cinematography, as well as the gore factor; unfortunately, the editing is sometimes too manic, like in the cornfield sequence. There's also a bit too much sleaze for my taste, including perversion (which was at least amusing).This is basically an amalgam of the original movie with elements of ""Freddy vs. Jason"" (2003), the remake of ""Friday the 13th"" (2009) and ""Scream"" (1996), plus the raunchiness of ""Psycho III"" (1986).Addison Timlin is effective as the winsome protagonist, Jami. Meanwhile Morganna Bridgers is on hand as Kendra, a girl that's enthusiastic about her man coming back from oversees, and Lanee Landry appears as Ardele. All three women are worthy one way or another. Veteran Veronica Cartwright even shows up.The film runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in Texarkana on the Texas/Arkansas border, as well as Shreveport, Louisiana.GRADE: B-/C+"
" A fun little reboot
",0.5106,0.9533,2021-02-22 00:00:00,6,"A pretty decent remake/reboot of one of the first slasher films. This one stands on its own pretty well, with good acting, fairly good writing and some entertaining kills.
The third act is a little predictable and disappointing, though it doesn't ruin the whole experience in my opinion.
Watch it if you enjoy the slasher genre, you won't dislike it."
" Rushed and Ludicrous
",-0.3612,0.1879,2021-01-18 00:00:00,2,"I was kinda enjoying it up to the ending. Maybe a 5/10 at best. However, the ""twist"" ending is so dumb, pointless and unnecessary that I just fast forwarded to the end. Garbage ending on a mediocre film.I can't believe they managed to make this worse than the 1976 original which is already a clunker. Oh boy."
" ''Alfonso Gomez-Rejon'' my new horror-hero
",0.0,0.1459,2020-11-09 00:00:00,8,"Exquisitely shot, extremely clever, surprisingly gory, and appropriately sleazy, the remake of The Town That Dreaded Sundown is one of the best of the modern horror remakes. Rather than simply rehash the '70s film, it takes a more meta approach by making it about a copycat killer reenacting the original, real life Texarkana murders in a world where the original movie exists and plays an integral part in the plot. I wish more remakes would have this much thought put into them."
" Interesting enough sequel/reboot
",0.4019,-0.9635,2020-09-25 00:00:00,7,"The slasher side of the film is tolerable, it does nothing new, but it hits the usual marks; a masked killer lurking in the shadows, some gory kills, a few buckets of blood. But the murder mystery side of the story is the more interesting part that keeps you watching. Like the Scream franchise, this movie is as much a whodunnit? as it is a slasher, and it will keep you guessing for sometime as to the identity of the killer. Maybe you'll guess it, or perhaps you'll be on the right track at least. It's not amazing, but it's an entertaining flick and an interesting way to set up a sequel, a sequel set in a reality where the first movie exists. Worth watching if you're a fan of slasher, or of the original, though I can't guarantee you'll love it."
" A movie ruined by its third act
",-0.4767,-0.4404,2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,I was impressed with this movie for the first two acts. Lovely cinematography and stylistic choices. When the movie got to the third act was when it fell apart completely. It is revealed that the boy who was killed at the beginning of the film actually was one of the two killers working together. It made absolutely ZERO sense and was idiotic beyond belief.Also the romance subplot was unnecessary and even cringey to watch.
" watch it!!!
",0.0,0.8857,2020-08-01 00:00:00,8,"I honestly don't get the negative reviews, a perfect movie for its genre! It's also nicely acted and edited, I can't think about anything to complain about really."
" The Return of the trombone
",0.0,-0.9994,2020-07-11 00:00:00,3,"""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" is a 2014 horror thriller directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon starring Addison Timlin and Veronica Cartwright. After previously having watched the atrocity that the original film has been, I also had to give the sequel (?) or whatever it is considered as a watch, just to complete the double feature and see if it is any better than its predecessor. As the film started, I was surprised to learn that it was produced by Blumhouse, the production company behind some popular horror flicks of the last years, such as ""Get Out"" and the 2018 sequel of ""Halloween"". While his filmography also shows some less terrific titles, I was still hoping that the influence of Jason Blum would be for the better in this case. As you can probably tell from how I worded those sentences, it sadly wasn't the case. It is one of the flicks that belong to the latter category of cinematic disasters. What do you expect from a film that bases its existence on some terrible trash flick from the seventies that most people probably never have heard of before? That a movie which centres around the phenomenon of a low budget disaster might still be successful is even possible, as seen in ""The Disaster Artist"", for instance, but with this garbage here the outcome is almost as dreadful as the original. First of all, I cannot even tell what this film is supposed to be in the first place. Is it a sequel? Is it a remake? Is it a fully original movie? To be honest, it is all of it and simultaneously none of it at all. Fact is that the original film from seventy-six is only a work of fiction here, and solely a movie that is shown annually around Halloween. A screening of said movie at a drive-in cinema in Texarkana, the setting where the murders occurred almost seventy years earlier, is where the plot begins. After protagonist Jami had to witness the atrocious assassination of her boyfriend by the hands of the mummed murderer (who, to my amazement, talked) at lovers lane and only survived because her lover's tormentor decided so, she tries to uncover the true identity of the man who dresses up as the man who haunted the town seven decades ago and decided to kill in the same manner as him. Generally, the film could have been great with this premise and could have made up for the terrible original, but as expected, it rather followed its path and became another unbearable abomination. The whole production feels more like an extended advertisement for the Charles B. Pierce flick and constantly shows posters, images and even scenes of it and I could almost hear it scream something like ""I am basing myself on this trash gem, go watch it now, because I cannot be anything on my own!"" and it shows in the following sequences that are supposed to be a plot. Curiously, as my brother correctly noticed and what I agreed with, this film here heavily criticises that the original has had a negative impact on the town and reopened the scars of those citizens who experienced the horrifying events themselves, but at the same time extremely praises its existence and, ironically, does the exact same by revisiting the topic once again. By this example you can already see how utterly confused this movie is by its own existence and with everything it tackles. Aside from some more or less decent effects and brutal yet repetitive killings, the movie tries to conceptualise a smart story that wants to manage the balancing act between honouring the original and be something on its own and utterly fails to achieve any of them. To be honest, the only way to describe it properly is by telling that it is a convoluted mess. All the characters are bland as hell, the frantic editing is as painful for the eyes as a sharpened knife and the acting is also not quite excellent. That latter is a thing is actually astonishing, as the film assembled some known faces that are capable of doing more. Next to Timlin in the leading role, also Gary Cole and Edward Herrmann (known as Max from ""The Lost Boys"", sadly one of his final roles) are one of the party as well, but it all founders on the downright dreadful writing. Strangely, it invests so much time in its characters and it is palpable that it wants the viewer to find a connection to them, but in the end, it was only wasted time, because they remain uninteresting to the very end. Furthermore, they are all just embodiments of overused, dull stereotypes that one has already seen several times before. The one is the classic final girl, the other is the overambitious cop, the one is the partner and love interest (and he is an absolute simp, as well) and the other is the fanatic priest that judges everything that doesn't have anything to do with god. Once again, I experienced an unrealistic and unexciting snooze fest that didn't grab me at all. Quite the contrary, it more confused me rather than entertain me. The majority of scenes were either pointless, unrealistic or didn't make any sense at all. I mean, just imagine you are brutally murdered by a masked killer and your girlfriend shows up to your memorial service with her new boyfriend, only a few days after you have passed away. You know what I mean? The script anxiously wants to include a romance between its two leading characters, but it is totally displaced, like everything else in this flick. I was bored throughout the whole film and didn't think it could become any worse. Until one specific scene: the return of the trombone. Seriously, they re-enacted the by far most ludicrous sequence from the original and I laughed with desperation while keeping myself from throwing the remote into the screen to make it stop. After another dull series of gruesome deaths, we finally get to know who the killer is. On one hand, it was predictable as hell, because the identity was more or less revealed by the son of the director of the original an hour in the movie, on the other hand it was surprising, because there were actually two killers. Two killers? Plural? Yes, indeed, as brain-melting as it sounds. One is indeed the descendant of the only victim that wasn't mentioned in the film (what still doesn't really justify his motivation to copy the man who has killed his grandpa back in the day), and the other was Jami's boyfriend who was actually and obviously murdered in the beginning. In his own words, he wanted to be someone remembered for anything else but being a football star. What the hell, man? The private motives of both killers are both senseless and really don't explain why they should kill innocent people. One has severe issues with the untimely passing of his grandpa he hasn't even met in his life, and the other suffers from teenage angst. That is enough to kill seemingly without rhyme or reason? This and how Jami eventually manages to finish off both of her persecutors gave me severe headache. It all just made zero sense. The indication that there still might be another killer right before the credits rolled didn't make it any better. All in all, this film is a terrible continuation of an already dreadful flick, and despite the potential it had, it eventually ends up basing its whole existence on the dumb original and becomes stupid itself. It relies too much on the cult status of its predecessor and doesn't even give the trouble to be something on its own. The characters are bland, the story is one big, convoluted mess and everything is far away from being gripping or intense. Not even the one or two gruesome effects are enough to call it enjoyable. This time it has had a runtime of less than ninety minutes and it was still a painful watch. Dumb, stupid and absolutely forgettable. I would rather be stabbed in the back to the rhythm of the music that a trombone makes than watch any of those dreadful atrocities ever again. Gee, it even makes me think that I have treated ""Friday the 13th"" too harshly. Going to revisit for one last time, I guess."
" Play it again...
",0.34,-0.9925,2020-02-12 00:00:00,5,"The Town That Dreaded Sundown. Don't call it a re-make, more like a sequel by the same name, sorta like The Thing that was a prequel to The Thing, which was a remake of The Thing from Another World, which was based on a story called Who Goes There, you know what I mean... So back to this... There was a series of murders dubbed the Moonlight Murders a bunch of years, by a killer never caught, in 1976 there was a movie made called The Town That Dreaded Sundown and this movie is mentioned because in this movie its real. (Logic: E.T. was a movie based in the real world, E.T.'s were present in Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace, which makes Star Wars real, which is why E.T. recognizes a trick or treater dressed as Yoda, gets excited and repeats the word 'Home"" over and over again). It opens at a drive-in where the crowd is watching... Anyone? And a couple of teens sneak off to bump uglies and the killer appears, looking like Mr. Voorhees pre-hockey mask, the girl (Addison Timlin - to see naked watch Californication) gets away, and as the killer is plowing through other couples doing it, she researches the prior murders just like every other horror movie with prolific body counts, Friday, Nightmare, Halloween, you get it. She meets a new guy, at the library who, bless his heart, helps her research the prior murders a day after her other boyfriend was just murdered Zodiac style. Enter the police, led by Anthony Anderson (ouch) who study the film for clues I guess, along with Gary Cole! (Peter, whats happening) The movie pretty much features clips from the 76 movie and the current killer just repeating the acts, unoriginal ideas, JJ Abram style flares, dull acting. You can doze off about 30 minutes into it, and you won't be missing anything despite having 4 stars on Netflix. So, yea a disappointing start to the rebirth of The List.

" Nice blend of homage and continuation
",0.4215,0.871,2020-01-21 00:00:00,8,"A hooded serial killer embarks on a savage spree 66 years after a similar series of murders were committed in the small country town of Texarkana.Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon keeps the absorbing story moving along at a constant pace, maintains a tough take-no-prisoners tone throughout, ably crafts a good deal of tension along with a creepy atmosphere, and provides a flavorsome evocation of the rural hamlet setting. Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's smart script not only delivers an inspired twist ending, but also cleverly plays around with a few slasher tropes and pays nifty tribute to the 70's drive-in classic right down to the infamous trombone murder sequence.Addison Timlin as the imperiled Jami makes for a fine and sympathetic heroine. Moreover, this film further benefits from a sturdy supporting cast: Veronica Cartwright as Jami's caring and concerned grandmother Lillian, Anthony Anderson as gung-ho Texas ranger Lone Wolf Morales, Joshua Leonard as the amiable Deputy Foster, Gary Cole as the crusty Chief Deputy Tillman, Edward Herrmann as the fire'n'brimstone Reverend Cartwright, and Ed Lauter as the weary Sheriff Underwood. The murder set pieces are quite bloody and brutal. Michael Goi's slick and sumptuous widescreen cinematography gives this picture an impressive polished look. A neat little flick."
" Great start, then like everything else....
",0.765,-0.6386,2019-11-17 00:00:00,5,"Really great, interesting beginning with a very engaging visual style & excellent production values, but things start to get confusing. I have no problem with the time jump story telling style, it's quite now & you just have to keep your brain engaged to keep up, but this one had me scratching my head. There are quite clear on screen time stamps stating that it's 2013, but there are classic cars from the 60's & 70's all over the place, many more than is normal, with many people dressed in similar period clothes & hairstyles. Fine I thought, we've jumped back in time, but it's the same female lead character back then, that's interesting, but no, there was no time jump & to cut it short, there is never any explanation of this (that I could see) & it is indeed present day. You may think this not a big deal & i love well done period pieces, but this just stopped me suspending my disbelief & getting into the film as I couldn't work out what I was seeing - in a bad way! This ruined the film for me & I just skipped to the just OK ending; which if you're hoping for a supernatural twist, you will be disappointed. It was only after watching the film, I came across the original film of the same name from 1976. This must somehow explain this period visual style, but not only will many viewers not know this, but it still doesn't explain this retro look to the film. If you're a die hard slasher buff, I do recommend this movie, it's pretty gory, I only suggest it to anyone else if you've nothing better to watch."

The 'Texas Ranger' was a slap in the face of Chuck Norris. This guy is arrogant, caustic, and unfriendly. He even steals Chuck Norris' handle, 'Lone Wolf' (From Lone Wolfe Mcquade). hollywood's portrayal of adults as stupid continues as a high school girl 'investigates' and out-thinks and outsmarts the adult investigators. hollywood's anti-Christian bigotry is rampantly represented in this movie and is inexcusable!"

" Different, but mediocre, with the crappy ending that plagues so many horror flicks
",-0.9075,-0.9992,2019-02-12 00:00:00,5,"This film is far from the worst horror entry I've seen, and it is one of the more unique films in recent years. It has some twists and turns, and the killer is genuinely scary in the vein of Son of Sam or the Zodiac.Of course, they threw in some gay dudes for some odd reason, that get killed in a silly way, and some other usual lovers. The couple at the beginning was just plain stupid, though, as they spot a man with a sack on his head staring at them menacingly from the bushes, and the boy in the car says, ""Just some peeping Tom; don't worry."" -- Yeah, sure. No worries. There is just some maniac weirdo staring at me while I get it on in a car, in the middle of nowhere at night, wearing a mask. Sure, happens to me all the time. They usually just want to take some photos and share a beer with you after you bone your date. What an idiot!!! We were laughing about that one for quite a while.Another issue, which is cliche in horror movies, is the lack of people around in EVERY killing. Like, I get it-- the killer stalks and waits for perfect moments and victims, but come on!!!! Something in real life always goes wrong, and random people show up in all sorts of places and in ways you couldn't plan for. In this film, the killer seems to roam the streets, apartment buildings, gas stations, and fields, all with impunity at night-- even though everyone, including Texas Rangers, are looking for them to kill again. A woman leaps from a hotel or apartment building and gets in a car, only to have the killer follow her down there and stab her all over the car. She couldn't lay on the horn or scream? No one heard all the breaking glass and fighting and yelling going on in a big building in town? No one ever sees a big dunce with a potato sack on his head wielding weapons? At least he used a silencer for some kills, but it was very convenient that no one ever seemed to be out or aware of anything at night, in a small town where people keep getting murdered. In that region, I would expect everyone to be armed, dogs on alert, alarms, patrols at night, traps to be set,-- something...lolOh, and Anthony Anderson was miscast as the lead Ranger detective in this. He did ok with the part, but I felt it was distracting and odd, as I so used to seeing him in raunchy comedies and sitcom stuff, and he didn't really seem like the type to be a Texas Ranger. Danny Glover or Tommy Lee Jones, yeah. Anthony Anderson? Uhh, kind of bizarre lolEverything else was pretty good, acting is good, and it has some different stuff that you haven't seen in every slasher movie, but like so many others in the genre, this one just couldn't produce a finishing finale for all the hype. The ending really made no damn sense at all. Two guys in on the killing? One is a cop? The other is a boy that was clearly shot by a Marine at a public vigil, in front of 100 people. How the hell did one cop get to file the reports, forego the autopsy, forge death certificate paperwork, and fake a burial, etc.????There were way too many people on the scene, and the guy was a high school or college student that everyone knew. He didn't have anyone check on him or his funeral? The police didn't investigate the shooting and weapon used, and do any further research on what happened? Apparently, they just let one cop check a gunshot victim for vital signs, and then the cop buries the kid in a swamp, alone, with no more questions asked. Unless I missed something, that is the idea behind the final twist at the end. The ending is so bad, it nearly ruins an otherwise decent slasher mystery movie."
" Way better than I thought it would be!
",0.4926,-0.9987,2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Alfonso Gomez-Rejon directing the movie Me, Earl and the Dying Girl probably wouldn't make you think that he could knock it out of the park when it comes to horror. Seeing that this was produced by Jason Blum and Ryan Murphy (Gomez-Rejon also worked with the latter on the excoriable American Horror Story) isn't something that would give you any hope, either. But man - this is way better than I would have ever thought and is actually a movie I've recommended to many people.October 31, 2013. Texarkana. The local drive-in is showing its annual event of the original The Town That Dreaded Sundown, which the film at once presents as an actual film in its universe but also one based on the true story of the Phantom Killer of 1946. Corey Holland and Jami Lerner do the typical slasher move of leaving the drive-in to make out before the Phantom attacks them, saying, ""This is for Mary. Make them remember.""With that, we're let loose in the modern world, where people have started to forget the Phantom but are about to get a devastating reminder of his power. There's a bravura sequence where a soldier comes back home from leave and instantly finds himself in a hotel with his girlfriend before leaving to get a drink. He's beheaded and the Phantom brutally kills her before calling Jami with Corey's phone, saying, ""I'm going to do it again and again until you make them remember.""Just like in 1946, people start locking their doors and demanding that the police do something. Much like an Americanized giallo, Jami responds by starting her own investigation with a former classmate named Nick. And then ""Lone Wolf"" Morales (Anthony Anderson) takes over the case from the locals, like Chief Deputy Tillman (Gary Cole, always a welcome face).Jami keeps getting emails from the killer, yet the police don't believe her. They already have the killer - a depressed teen who has dressed up as the Phantom to die via suicide by cop. But the murderer isn't really dead, as the remake/reimagining redoes the first film's infamous trombone murder one better by having the Phantom wipe out a young male couple.The cops decide to look closer at the email and determine that it came from Reverend Cartwright (Edward Herrmann in his last role) but don't believe he is the killer. Jami hasn't stopped looking and learns that Charles B. Pierce's (the creator of the original as well as The Legend of Boggy Creek) son still lives in the area. He believes that this Phantom is the grandson of Hank McCreedy, the forgotten sixth victim of the original Phantom, who had a wife named Mary.Meanwhile, the Phantom moves on to even killing cops, wiping out Tillman while he's instigating a sword fight with a lady he's brought home from the bar. While all this is going on, Jami decides to leave town to go to college and loses her virginity to Nick, who is quickly killed by the Phantom.As she tries to leave town with her grandmother, the Phantom attacks them at a gas station, killing nearly everyone with a rifle. Jami finds Nick's body just as she's pinned to a wall by arrows and learns that there are two killers - Deputy Foster, who is McReady's grandson and her boyfriend Corey, who had faked his death. Corey tries to tell her that Texarkana had a box made for them and they are the same, but she rejects him. Foster then shoots Cory so that he has a patsy to blame, but Jami shoots him and escapes. His body is never found.In the end, Jami is off at college, far away from small town life. Yet even there, the shadow of the Phantom is still there.This movie is never going to replace the original, obviously. It has none of the abrupt shifts in narrative tone, instead staying firmly in dark territory. But unlike so many modern remakes, it both honors and adds to the movie that it came from."
" I Dread Ever Watching This Again
",-0.4588,0.9267,2018-12-31 00:00:00,2,"So, let's hope I don't have to watch it again. Bad acting, a relationship between two characters that wasn't compelling at all, a ending that I saw coming from a mile away: these are just a few reasons why I dislike this movie. I love horror and slasher movies, but only when they are good. This movie is not good. It's boring and unoriginal. There was no need to make it. They could have just kept with the original, but now I feel that this movie has ruined the original for me. The movie was slow, as well. Not very good at all."

The year is 2013 but the costume design is from the 70s, at the Sheriff's station a young man has what looks to be a 24"" monitor for a Dell computer but the police themselves in another shot have REALLY old computers the ones with the fat backs. I get that it can be realistic it's a small town with low budgets for cops but even in the motel scene you have TVs with antennas from the 70s or 80s but they also have cellphones, the design it's all over the place and it was very distracting watching all these inconsistencies."

One was the infamous sliding trombone scene where he kills a girl with her own instrument. This film shows pieces of that scene and then goes on to do a bad recreation/tribute. The second aspect that we loved was the fact Dawn Wells (sweet Mary Ann from ""Gilligan's Island"") was in a horror film, a woman we had all grown up loving as the girl next door. She was the Marsha Brady of the previous generation. Addison Timlin is not my Dawn Wells.The film opens with two prospective victims and one suspect as a couple goes out parking. Soon the boy is dead and Jami (Addison Timlin) is left alive with instructions to remind everyone about ""Mary."" Jami conducts her own investigation as the body counts rises.I was fairly bored with the copycat killer/ tribute film. The characters lacked decent development and personality. The dialogue was idiotic as when one sheriff begs a room full of people, ""Call me Lone Wolf. I deserve it."" And we know that how?

It's more of a polished crapfest with mediocre moments.What's odd is I found myself thinking of jokes while watching the whole thing; along with criticizing some of the editing. The majority of The Town That Dreaded Crippling Deppression was full of several predictable moments and cliches.We're supposed to believe that it takes place in 2014, yet there's 70's style of cars and clothing, along with phones that look like they're from the mid 2000's. The killer talking was what made me laugh at the beginning. If I'm correct, wasn't the killer from the original silent the whole time?Some characters were bland while a few were okay. It wasn't the worst acting, but could've been much better. Also (again with the time setting) are drive-ins still a thing?Now the so called ""twist"" at the ending was so stupid and impossible, especially what is shown at the beginning. The dude was stabbed several times like a hooker in an alleyway and is one of the two killers? That was another dumb twist. It's two people...I only watched it once and plan on keeping it that way.

" Surprisingly Effective
",0.6486,-0.7214,2018-10-04 00:00:00,8,"I would first of all like to say that this is not a remake, it has a completely different story to the original and acts more as a sequel. This film takes place in Texarkana in the ""real world"" where both the events of the phantom killer occurred and were made into the original movie. This time a set of copycat crimes occur due to reasons I cannot explain without spoiling the plot.This version of The Town That Dreaded Sundown is effectively scary, relying not too much on jump-scare methods and rather well placed suspense. There are a few jump-scares, however these are done correctly and are not overdone/fake ""cat scares"" that often happen. Once again like in the original the costume design of the killer is simple yet effectively creepy as it gives them an almost ghostlike appearance. The film also takes advantage of wide shots that show the killer creeping up on victims.One major downside of this movie is that it has an awkward and unoriginal plot twist towards the end. However, despite this it still comes across very effectively due to good performances from everyone involved and is not overly reliant on jump-scares but rather suspense, which is refreshing given that so many horror movies today rely too much on these."
" Decent with the Usual Tropes and TERRIBLE ENDING
",-0.5904,0.8302,2018-08-29 00:00:00,6,"Plain and simple...a decent movie where all the guys are scum and the females are perfection.The movie lacked sex appeal. It is as if Hollywood stopped making realistic horror movie characters and said here, women are better than everyone, have brains, brawn and seriously...that's it.The movie was a bit of a letdown and some of the camera work was jarring. The plot as mentioned above was about a slasher. I THINK this was a sequel. In reality, the females cannot over power men, and tend to lack morality. It's as if Hollywood began pushing propaganda in films to destabilize culture and this movie is proof.The ending was really bad....JUST made no sense. Nothing to do with the character motivations, but rather how easily it was resolved. It seems as if it just happened because it was written that way and so we must accept it. Without ruining anything, I just don't get who would write such a shoddy ending that was without real struggle?"
" A clever remake that is not actually a remake: as captivating as the original with a modern touch.
",0.6486,0.9826,2018-08-08 00:00:00,7,"The Town That Dreaded Sundown has its fair share of clichés, but that doesn't make it a bad film. It is probably the most ""progressive"" remake in the history of cinema, because it acknowledges the original 1970s film and the events that led to the film , and uses them as a pivotal part of the storyline in a manner that has never been done before. The writing, as i mentioned before, has some horror clichés in it, but the progressive way that the original film has been remade makes up for it right away after the first 15 minutes.Gomez-Rejon's directing has almost no flaws, he is superb in what I assume his feauture film debut, the use of light is extremely captivating, I guess we should thank the cinematographer as well as Gomez-Rejon for that. This film is a must-watch for the lovers of the genre and especially for the fans of the original film. I bet it would be a huge film if Blumhouse Productions was as highly valued as it is today back in 2014."
" Why did I sit through this?
",0.0,-0.9766,2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"I remember the movie from 1976 and had no idea there was a 2014 movie until I saw it on Amazon Prime. Having found nothing else interesting to watch, I unfortunately began to watch. BIG mistake. This one was very predictable. You always knew when the killer was going to strike...down to the second. Hardly any suspense. But even in a bad movie, I expect things to be at least somewhat believable. For a town that had suffered multiple murders at night, why, in the last few minutes when Jami and her grandmother are leaving town, is there no police presence on the streets? Nowhere. Come on. That's some BS. And who goes on a trip from Texas to California and leaves at night? That's quite unusual....you leave first thing in the morning, which coincidentally is the SAFEST time of the day in Texarkana. For a town that ""dreaded sundown"" you sure couldn't tell it...they were out and about all the time after dark (except for the police, of course). The sex scene seemed to be thrown in just for the hell of it.....sort of out of place even for a slasher film, which I guess is what this one was?I was so surprised that five established actors actually participated in this POS. Now I wish I had that hour and a half back. Pass on this one, folks."
" The Town Which Dreaded Sundown (2014)
",-0.5719,-0.2196,2018-03-06 00:00:00,7,"It's based on the original movie with same title, which itself is based on true events. Three layers of meta or so, since the characters here know and watch the 1976 movie, with the killer repeating the scenes. Unlike the 1976 movie, this one feels much more engaging and fresh - not just because of the intriguing story which keeps you on the edge guessing who is the killer, but also because of the visuals. It has some creative camera work which greatly adds to the overall atmosphere. The director from Spain was the right choice, because in case with some American horror director they most likely would make yet another boring by-the-book reboot. The main heroine is a way too lightheaded and naive though.7.5/10"
" Boring, boring boring. Did I mention boring?
",-0.802,-0.8247,2018-01-27 00:00:00,1,"A ""loose"" (and very loose at that) remake of the 1970s movie of the same name, this is based on a series of murders that happened back in the 1940s in a small Texan town that left five dead. Sound good and exciting? It should be. But in this remake, its not.
A lot of time is spent watching people talk and not really do much. I don't know why so many people gave this such high reviews. I guess they like their horror boring."
" Spoilers follow ...
",0.0,-0.9756,2017-10-11 00:00:00,4,"65 years ago, a masked man attacked residents of small town Texarkana. Now it appears the miscreant is back. Speaking with a modulated voice in slow deliberate tones, the 'moonlight murderer' begins his killing spree all over again.The production values are decent, the acting is convincing. So why do I find this tortuously dull? How can something with a fair amount of screaming teens and restrainedly gruesome killings not arrest my attention? Could it be that Jami (Addison Timlin) speaks in a monotone and insipid manner no matter what the emotion? To be fair to her, her contempories are often much the same. Far from the strutting posturers that frequent such films usually (which is a mercy), they are on the other end of the spectrum. Humbly mumbling their lines to one another, it is difficult to work out one character from another. Inoffensive –sweet even - to the point of inertia, these characters are barely even cyphers for the marauding killer, who is also without much in the way of presence.It may be that I am simply not in the mood for this, but there seems to be no life in any facet of the proceedings. Even the occasional sex scene fails to break free of this miasma. Why is the murderer doing these things? Just *because*, really. I feel bad about my nonchalance – after all, a great deal of work has presumably gone into creating this: the bleakness of the locale is nicely conveyed by Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and Ludwig Goransson's musical score is nicely haunting; there's a good set piece where a couple wake up to find their scarecrow perched on the wooden stand has been replaced by the bloody corpse of a young girl  and then within moments the lacklustre performance of those trying to solve the mystery drags things back down again. Sadly unengaging throughout."
" Not worth your time.
",-0.1695,-0.9584,2017-08-26 00:00:00,2,"This film is not a remake, but sequel. The action takes place in modern times and there is another wave of killings in Texarkana. However plenty of scenes and characters are simply copied from the movie of 1976. In general - the film was boring, predictable, characters were artificial (especially terrible ""Lone Wolf"" - why the same nickname?). Not worth your time."
" Texarkana is doomed to forever Dread Sundown!
",-0.8172,-0.9993,2017-07-26 00:00:00,6,"(Spoilers only in the last paragraph!! Feel free to read the rest)The original ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"", released in 1976, is still one of the most underrated classics in the horror genre and also a major personal favorite of mine because of three reasons. First of all because I'm a huge admirer of typically rural, raw and atmospheric low-budget 70s horror exactly like writer/director Charles B. Pierce used to make them. Secondly because I'm a sucker for slasher flicks in which eerily masked killers stalk and slash hapless teenagers. This sub genre boomed during the 80s, mainly thanks to the success of ""Friday the 13th"", but undeniably ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"" was one of the pioneers that set out the basic rules. And finally, I have a deep fascination for horror films that are based on or inspired by true crime cases. ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"" was based on the infamous 1946 so-called Texarkana Moonlight Murders, and they only became extra legendary since they never got solved. All this just to sum up that the original is a fantastic milestone, and evidently I was rather furious when I first heard there was going to be a remake. At least I assumed the 2014 film would be a remake And I stubbornly kept assuming this long after its release and stupidly boycotted the film, until now I finally took the effort to read a little more about it. The new ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"" isn't really a remake of the 1976 film, nor is it a sequel or a re-imaging/different interpretation of the same factual murder cases. The film is somewhat of a mixture of all this and simultaneously a homage to the 70s film and a remembrance of the real events. Apparently there already even exists a term for this type of movies, namely meta- sequels. 67 years after the five unsolved murders, the events and especially the image of the creepy Phantom Killer still haunt the town of Texarkana. Fewer and fewer people are old enough to remember the actual crimes, but every year around Halloween the local drive- in theater programs the 1976 movie that was actually filmed in Texarkana and grew out a local cult classic. Young lovers Jami and Corey attend the screening in the fall of 2013, but sneak out early to spend some private time together at the old Lover's Lane. Suddenly a psychopath, unmistakably wearing the exact same primitive mask as the Phantom Killer wore in '46, comes out of the woods, repeatedly stabs Corey in the back and allows for Jami to walk away with a bizarre message/warning. Fear, mayhem and also a bit of excitement immediately rises in Texarkana. The Phantom Killer was never apprehended, but he must be dead or at least too old to start killing again. As more brutal slayings are being committed in the next following weeks, only one thing is certain: Texarkana will have to start dreading sundown once again Naturally I already regret not having checked out ""The Town the Dreaded Sundown"" sooner! For about three quarters of the running time, this is definitely one of the better slasher efforts of the last 10-15 years. There's a more than fair amount of suspense, especially during the sequences where our masked killer is stalking his victims (notably in the cornfield or the abandoned theme park) and the murders are suitably vile and gruesome. The meta-sequel elements are professionally handled; meaning the original film exists within this new story and also the initial '46 murders fit in logically. I particularly liked the opening sequences that depict Texarkana AD 1946 versus AD 2013, and there's a masterful scene illustrating how terrified people are barricading their doors and windows just like they did during the first murder spree. The sub plot of introducing the son of the original film's director, Charles B. Pierce Jr, as a Texarkana local and an expert of the case is perhaps a bit exaggerated but nevertheless still ingenious. In fact, ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"" was busy becoming a brand new personal favorite of mine, if only it wasn't for the fact they somehow completely ruined the ending. The makers probably couldn't afford (or wanted) to keep the new murders unresolved as well; I can relate to that. However, their desire to surprise the viewer with an unpredictable denouement causes them to revert to dumb and disappointing plot twists that are reminiscent to ""Scream"". Suddenly there are two culprits, one with motives more ridiculous than the other, and all the positive aspects that were so carefully built up are destroyed during a brief, gratuitous and insignificant finale."
" Meta Grindhouse Horror Remake
",-0.5719,-0.4436,2017-05-07 00:00:00,6,"The list of grindhouse horror classics that were rebooted and worked well is pretty short (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" are two that did work), and this one mostly works and had a clever twist on not simply being a remake or reboot. The premise here is that 65 years after the masked serial killer in Texarkana went on his killing spree, a new copycat killer is now recreating the murders from the 1970s Charles B. Pierce grindhouse film version of the actual murders. This film boasts a producer, director, and writer from the American Horror Story team, so you would expect something clever and this film does deliver. I think I was most excited when this film brought the Pierce film into the story as a major plot point, including creating a creepy fictional son of Pierce played by AHS regular Denis O'Hare, making the film rather meta. Also appearing in the film are Veronica Cartwright, Anthony Anderson, Gary Cole, Edward Herrmann, Ed Lauter, and even Danielle Harris if you look fast. Overall, this was a clever reboot that although it's not as scary or creepy as I'd have hoped, is smart and never boring."
" The movie that dreaded the ending.
",-0.5719,-0.9848,2017-05-03 00:00:00,7,"The Town That Dreaded Sundown: 7 out of 10: Before I start with the spoiler let me say for the vast length of its running time The Town that Dreaded Sundown is a top quality horror film with good atmosphere and some genuinely top notch scenes. It is a remake of the mid-seventies ""true story"" slasher flick that, like the similarly themed Black Christmas, came out a few years before Halloween but simply didn't have the magic of that meticulous movie. The remake intelligently folds the original film into its narrative by having a festival celebrating when the horror film was made locally and the movie opens in a drive-in theater at the heart of that festival. Along with solid visuals, location shooting, and camera work the film sports above board, for the genre, acting. In fact, it is a delight to see Anthony Anderson back on the big screen chewing scenery and taking names. The late Ed Lauter, an actor you immediately recognize but cannot quite place, is also very good in his last role. (As an aside to this aside this movie also sports Edward Herrmann's last role and while he doesn't quite make the same impression as Ed in this movie he certainly fits the actor you immediately recognize but cannot quite place trope to a T.)Okay, Spoiler Alert. (Submarine alarm horn alert, interior perspective repeated twice.) The ""reveal"" for this film is awful. The movie simply cheats. You are supposed to guess which of our heroine's friends is dressing up as an old serial killer and recreating his crimes. The movie spends a significant amount of time on this mystery. It turns out to be two people. The first is our protagonist's boyfriend who is ""killed"" while they are about to have sex at the beginning of the flick. Why is he a masked serial killer? I think he claimed he was either was bored or wanted to be famous. His motivation is as weak as having him alive. I mean our heroine goes to his funeral the next day. Nobody noticed the body wasn't him? Switching bodies doesn't usually work during a murder investigation.Our other killer is the helpful and almost a love interest in his own right Deputy Foster who reveals (at the end of course) that he is the grandson of the killer haha just kidding he reveals he is the grandson of the killer's last victim named McCreedy. The film even takes the time to visit a local filmmaker historian to declares this unknown (and up to this point unmentioned) McCreedy relative may be our killer. The family was angry because his killing was left out of the original exploitation film apparently. (Fair enough I know the film claims they felt overlooked since the original murder. But come on people. My relative was brutally chopped by an ax and not hit by a train so our family needs um credit? It is a strange grudge to keep up for a year let alone over three generations.)Could the ending have worked? Well make the boyfriend's body disappear after being killed (and having authority figures secretly doubt our heroine till the next murders) is a tried and true technique that would have fit well here. Having Deputy Foster named Deputy McCreedy would have also gone a long way to creating suspense (Maybe that filmmaker/historian is right and if so the killer was at her house the entire time.) In reality, however, the biggest twin problems would still remain. Neither character has anything resembling a motivation to go around killing their neighbors and more damning they have absolutely no connection with each other. I have no idea how the jock boyfriend and the Deputy even know each other let alone are intimate enough to go on a secret killing spree together.Up until that point, the film is fun. It can be brutal and has some scares but it earns them honestly. The film is well acted with a nice progressive polish that one does not often see in one's backwoods slasher films. Overall a good movie that hits above its weight let down by a poorly thought out denouement"
" Some Good Cinematography in Spots but Nothing New in Plot
",0.2382,-0.3865,2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"There's nothing new or innovative in this film. It's formulaic from beginning to end. With few exceptions, those going to die and what comes afterward are as clear as an outline.Though well-acted by a veteran cast, the movie is at times episodic-appearing, fading to a flashback and back again in such a way the viewer may think at first it's part of the current scene. The ""Movie in the Park"" is also intershot with the first chase scene, confusing the action. To further confound things, there are two voice-overs, a narrator and Jami.When grisly death occurs, it's surprisingly lacking in gore. Killings are shown in shadow or silhouette, as long shots, or the camera pans away at a strategic moment. Most of the famous ""trombone knifing"" scene concentrates on the killer's face.One very good and imaginative shot is from above a corn field, showing the killer going in one direction while his victim crawls on hands and knees in the opposite, their paths clearly delineated in artistic patterns by trampled cornstalks.The best things going for this film are its sometimes creative cinematography, and the fact that characters usually not killed, are, in this one."
