" Watch this one more than once
",0.0,0.9413,2021-03-18 00:00:00,9,"It's a true film maker that creates something like this that you just can't catch on the first viewing. A work of art in every aspect of filmmaking.When you watch it the second, third, etc. time, the nuances of the characters in play, the scenery, editing, and viewer attachment changes. It is a living film that though it's presentation had not changed, your reaction and appreciation does.It's a bit like reading Animal Farm when you are 16 and then again later in life."
" It's hard to deny the mans genius
",-0.4215,0.9259,2021-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Really enjoyed this. The beginning was a little slow and I think the movie overall was a touch too long, otherwise amazing story, characters and holy crap is NZ beautiful or what? Waititi is amazing."
" Positive, unlike most movies
",0.5574,0.9463,2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,"You will not laugh your head off but this movie has a great positive feeling. It's worth to watch it, time well spent."
" Nice modern fairy tale
",0.4215,0.6448,2021-02-16 00:00:00,7,"This is a really nice, warm, fuzzy movie. It's not really outstanding in any real way, but it is good."
" Embarrassingly mediocre
",-0.4019,0.9882,2021-02-14 00:00:00,2,"Well, just like many others I was drawn to the high score ""this must be great, right?""....wrong! Although it starts with some amusing scenes it quickly highlights wooden acting, a poor script, and the question of why oh why does the score for the movie equal that of The Blues Brothers?
Another reviewer mentioned that it was perhaps a case of the Emperor's new clothes, I tend to agree; also perhaps a fiercely loyal following from the Kiwis.....I get that they would want to celebrate their own, and the beautiful scenery which abounds.... but the film itself is really only watchable until the funeral scene and then becomes tedious.
I am sure that everyone involved with the production were lovely, enthusiastic, and trying their best to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but sadly it remains just a sow's ear that looks like a purse.... The film is probably between 3 to 4 (no higher) but I hope my 2 will help to re-calibrate the score and act as a suitable caveat for film buffs everywhere."
" Don't waste your time
",0.3252,0.9288,2021-02-07 00:00:00,1,"I've had more enjoyable trips to the dentist.
The casting of Julian Dennison makes this film so cringe worthy. It's like a commercial. The casting is so hard to stomach. The best bit.... the credits"
" A fantastic earlier work by Taika Waititi.
",0.5574,0.9975,2021-02-05 00:00:00,8,"After enjoying films like Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Jojo Rabbit (2019), I decided to watch some of director Taika Waititi's previous films. First up is Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016), a humorous outdoor adventure that doesn't hide many of its influences, which ends up being a good thing. The plot and style are somewhat reminiscent of Moonrise Kingdom (2012) but takes advantage of New Zealand's wilderness to tell its own story. There is plenty of character development, and the two leads-played by Sam Neill and Julian Dennison-work well together to create a meaningful connection.Anyone who has seen other New Zealand comedies are likely to enjoy the specific cultural brand of humor here that feels like an evolved version of the classic British humor of the 1960s. Hunt for the Wilderpeople uses its minor characters to deliver its humor, with Rhys Darby carrying an exceptionally funny sequence. It's this irreverent humor that hints at what Waititi's future works would become. There were plenty of instances where I could see how this film eventually influenced films like Jojo Rabbit. Sure, there are still some rough edges here, but it's nice to see what Waititi could do with the raw elements at his disposal.Some of the musical and directorial choices here feel like an homage to Wes Anderson's style, which I certainly am not complaining about. There are still fantastic, uniquely Waititi bits, though, including a montage that seems to be shot in one continuous pan across the scenery. One can only wonder if this plot would have suffered were it not for Sam Neill and his best Harrison Ford impression, though. The vulnerability in this tough-guy fa√ßade made the adoptive father/son dynamic work well enough that it carried the whole film.A fantastic earlier work by Taika Waititi, I give Hunt for the Wilderpeople 4.0 stars out of 5."
" Gets annoying after too many watches.
",-0.4019,0.9923,2021-02-03 00:00:00,6,"I've seen this movie way too many times. I don't even enjoy it THAT much, it's just a go to movie for us kiwi's. Not the fruit. It's pretty much a kiwi classic already, everyone here loves it and everyone here loves Taika.I don't have much to say at all, it's funny and heartfelt. It's not challenging or emotional for the most part, it's just fun and I can't even deny that. I really like most of the performances, getting the actual news anchors is pretty hilarious and almost every scene is quotable.My favourite element is easily the script, it's consistently funny and keeps slower scenes entertaining with comedic moments riddled throughout. The locations used are also great, they're places people who live in New Zealand will likely recognise and that adds another layer of enjoyment for me.I enjoy the score quite a lot but I'm a little biased as one of my relatives did all of the percussion... which is my favourite part of the composition. The score is only used in a couple scenes though and is not very special overall, the rest of the music is made up of pre-existing songs which all fit they're respective scenes well enough.Check this out if you like easy going, funny fun movies. If you prefer more of a challenge you won't enjoy it unless you have been to or are from New Zealand. Being a kiwi really helps when watching Taika's movies, makes them feel far more personal than they might be."
" A movie you want to keep watching
",0.0772,0.9478,2021-02-01 00:00:00,9,I didn't expect anything when I turned this in but thIs was one of the best movies I've watched recently. This movie has some of the most likeable characters and a story that doesn't really go anywhere but keeps you so invested. A truly haertwarming tale.
" This has to be on of the best films of 2021!
",0.6696,0.8176,2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,I loved this film. Sam Neil gives an excellent performance. Very different from his usual roles. But it's the young boy who carries the film. It reminded me of Whale Rider. Where they cast an unknown actress in the lead. New Zealand has an exceptional range of talent.
" Absolutely fantastic
",0.5984,0.9799,2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"This movie proves that modern comedy can be absolutely endearing, charming and funny without being crass vulga or base.
A lot of credit has to go to the actors in this one.
The Kiwis really know how to laugh at themselves and the cast carried it off to perfection.
I've watched it four times now and laugh as hard and enjoy it as much as I did the first time.
Hollywood take note: this is how it's done.
You used to be good at comedy. ""Uncle Buck"" was endearing without being disgraceful like the buffoon in ""hangover"".
The bad guys in ""home alone"" will bed but not cruel. just like the ""bad guys"" in this movie.
Great stuff congratulations on a wonderful production."
" Great Quirky Movie!
",0.6588,0.9589,2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Funny movie in a very quirky way. The dialog is smart, unique, and keeps you guessing. It's a fun ride with a good warm hearted story attached. You'll enjoy this movie for it's atypical characters and funny banter!"
" Wholesome
",0.0,0.4588,2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,This is one of the most wholesome movie I've ever watched. It's nearly faultless.
" Touching, hilarious, and Unforgettable
",0.4019,0.9825,2021-01-17 00:00:00,8,"I was not sure initially about this film, having originally seen the trailer and thinking it looked like a standard quirky, indie film. After looking into it more I realized it was directed by Taika Waititi so I adjusted my expectations and dove in.I was pleasantly surprised, there were equal amounts of fantastic comedy hand in hand with human drama and tragedy. The relationship between Hec and Ricky feels organic and the actors play off each other incredibly well. The farcical nature of the over the top social worker Paula is also one of the excellent points of the film, providing some wonder lampooning of Hollywood archetypes.One other thing I must call out as a point for me that really makes this enjoyable is that it never insults its audience trying to crowbar in overly idealized Hollywood style happy endings. Not to say the film ends in a sad way, far from it, but it's a realistic and three dimensional ending with fleshed out characters that do not simply ride off into the sunset in perfection. The fact that every character is flawed and human is exactly one of the finest points of the film, and the story lives up to those characters.Highly recommend this, well worth watching."
" Full of heart
",0.0,0.9661,2021-01-13 00:00:00,9,"The Hunt for the Wilderpeople is about a mischievous boy who is placed in a foster home. After his foster mother dies, he goes on a great adventure with his foster father trying to escape the government. This film is full of heart, funny, and really enjoyable. It's a really good story and really is another great Taika Waititi film. I rate The Hunt for the Wilderpeople a 9/10."
" Shocking yet funny
",0.0516,0.8442,2021-01-12 00:00:00,10,"It's a movie I could watch again and again it gets better as it goes along and not something to take your eyes off for a second, a wonderful film. Only one thing... I would've thought the fat kid would've ended up fit as a fiddle after his stay in the wilds."
" Stories round the 'campion' fire
",-0.34,0.8834,2021-01-11 00:00:00,2,"A creative comedy from a triple threat talent. Writing credits do go to Barry Crump whose novel, 'Wild Pork and Watercress' the story is adapted from. Eighties Hollywood is notably referenced throughout the film. How much of the budget did go to Sam Neil? All the cast, including Taika Waitiki, deliver the punchlines on cue. Released in 2016 with cinema distribution. There is, real life, romantic realism and drama in a even ratio."
" HEARTWARMING.
",0.4767,0.9258,2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"As usual Waititi perfectly balances cartoonish humour, with adventure and genuinely moving drama. The two leads play off each other marvellously. Story so crazy. Scenery just devastatingly beautiful. The kid is great."

",0.8271,0.9618,2021-01-09 00:00:00,10,"I recently rewatched this- I love how funny each moment is. The characters are well created and just a touch quirky without 'quirky' being their defining characteristic.I now want to explore the New Zealand bush.Additionally, the musical choices are excellent. And as always, a cameo from the director himself makes for a memorable laugh."
" No Faults - Brilliant Comedy
",0.25,-0.8083,2021-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Before I watched this film, I read nothing about it, so I wasn't sure what to expect at all. Judging by the display image on Netflix of a boy holding a gun, I thought it would have a serious undertone. I was very wrong; it was an incredibly quirky comedy.A foster parent and an orphan hiding in the wilderness from the child safety authorities in New Zealand. That's all I'll say!Brilliant film!"
" The Best Wes Anderson Movie of All Time
",0.6369,0.8175,2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"It's honestly as if Wes Anderson traveled forward in time, saw this movie, and based all of his movies on this one. This movie is hilarious, touching, compelling, and thought provoking. The only reason it's not 10 stars is because a few characters and scenes are over the top in a slightly annoying manner, but for the most part this movie is gold. I immediately watched it a second time, and I'll happily watch it again."
" Majestical

" Like Up, but Make it Gangster
",0.1901,0.9967,2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople, is written and directed by Taika Waititi and stars Sam Neill and Julian Dennison. The film follows the misadventure of a young boy, named Ricky and his foster Uncle Hec, as the two escape into the wilderness all while a nationwide manhunt is underway to find the pair. Taika Waititi has made a name for himself as being a very respected writer/director, with a quirky style √° la Wes Anderson and Hunt for the Wilderpeople more than solidifies his reputation.I went into Hunt for the Wilderpeople with moderate to high expectations after hearing pretty positive praise surrounding the film, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the end result, enjoying the film from start to finish. It should be noted, as many other's have pointed out, that the film's framework is very similar to Pixar's Up (2009); as both films feature a disgruntled older man who has just lost someone close to him and an energetic young boy who has a semi-warped view of the world and lacks a parental figure. However Hunt for the Wilderpeople, does an excellent job differentiating itself from the surface level comparison and can be enjoyed just as much as the Pixar classic.I found the bond that grew between Hec and Ricky to be heart-warming as their adventure elapsed many months, encountering all kinds of different people, problems and animals along the way. I really rooted for the pair, even when their situation grew to be more dire, I must praise Waititi in that aspect as he was able to really make the character's likeable and easy to root for. It also helps that the performances were also great with, as Neill and Dennison both gave compelling performances that were full of heart. I was particularly impressed by Julian Dennison, who I was worried was going to become loud and annoying as the movie progressed, however through his solid portrayal of Ricky, he grew to be a protagonist that I really enjoyed seeing. Although the dynamic between the two character's is a joy to watch, the film has a equally pleasing presentation that is interesting and unique in its own right. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is presented in chapters, which signifies a new point in the duo's journey, and usually hints at what's to come. The film is also really pleasing to look at, with many interesting shots, one of my favourites being how the filmmakers captured montages, with one shot pans that almost superimposed the character's moving about different parts of the forest. It's a little difficult to explain but noticeable when viewing the movie, and I thought it was a clever way to establish the journey without featuring a montage littered with jump cuts.In closing, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a highly enjoyable film that I see myself returning to, it's clever, heartwarming and full of adventure. Although aspects of the story do not try to reinvent the formula of a misfit-buddy film, I still took away lots from this film and is overall a treat to watch. There a many small details that I'm sure I didn't notice as you can clearly tell Waititi poured a lot of heart into the creation of this film and for that reason I am giving Hunt for the Wilderpeople a 8/10."
" Theatre of the Absurd
",0.0,0.8779,2020-12-29 00:00:00,3,"In typical Taika Waititi style, this film attempts to merge absurdist characters with a heartfelt story line. The result is that the 'kooky' characters are about as funny as stale bread and the heartfelt story line feels like one long run on sentence. Hard no on this one for me."
" Weirdly Engaging Adventure Story in New Zealand's Wilderness
",0.3612,0.998,2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"New Zealand cinema is not often regarded as fondly as it should be outside of the likes of Peter Jackson, Jane Campion and Niki Caro, but when a breakout filmmaker like Taika Waititi comes up with something big, you know you're gonna be in for a treat. Before Waititi made it big with the likes of Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit, he was one of New Zealand's newest up & coming filmmakers with films like Boy and What We Do in the Shadows. In between all of those films, he made a film adaptation of Barry Crump's Wild Pork and Watercress, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which at the time was the country's highest grossing film.Centering on juvenile delinquent Ricky Baker and his foster father Hector ""Hec"" Faulkner, the two become subjects of child welfare and other killers upon getting stranded in the New Zealand wilderness. It's clear from the start that this is a character driven narrative, as most of the development is based on Ricky and Hector having to work with one another just to survive. With Hector being Ricky's only father figure and the wilderness being the closest Ricky has ever felt to a close connection, partially from Hector's late wife Bella, their chemistry works the most whenever the forest forces them to work based on their surroundings. By contrast, whenever the child protective services are around, the film portrays them as sinister without painting them as soulless corporations all the time. While Ricky loathes based on what they do to kids with no foster parents left, they're only trying to do what's best for the kids despite not realizing what the child really needs. In many ways, the wilderness speaks to a niche selection of people, therefore it can never connect to the services in the same way.In addition to the characters themselves making the journey fun, the actors do so much with the material they're given. Sam Neill and Julian Dennison are simply delightful as Hec and Ricky, especially with their basic old man vs young kid schtick bouncing off each other so well. With Neill being somewhat of a veteran in New Zealand cinema and films in general, his performance as a bitter yet well intentioned wilderness man is enough to make one feel for the man. Even the supporting cast is delightful in their own right, especially Rachel House having so much fun portraying both the good mannered yet somewhat evil side of child welfare worker, Paula Hall, and Oscar Knightley as her loyal yet voice of reason police in command, Andy. The notable characters that Hec and Ricky meet along the way range from foes against them such as three foolish hunters to genuine defenders like Kahu and her laid back father. Whether they be all for or against the two wilderpeople, these characters cement the journey as a truly harrowing experience.In terms of cinematography, this film might be one of the most bold cinematic experiences of showcasing the outer and inner wilderness of New Zealand in history. Everytime the wilderpeople are out in the open, there's no limit of just how vast and gorgeous the forests are, from pristine plantlife, to specific shot compositions, to gorgeous lighting; it's all a sight for the eyes. Considering the film had a budget of NZ$4.5 million, the filmmakers really knew how to utilize their limitations, and even the occasional digital effect blends in well enough with the world the film is set in without coming off as jarring. In addition, the music score adds in that authentic flavor of adventurous music that you almost never quite hear anymore. If there's one genuine complaint to give the film, it would be that they occasionally rush through some key details, such as Ricky's feelings for Kahu and the resolution after the climax. While they get their points across concisely, they also feel underdeveloped and maybe could have used a little extra screen time to allow the viewers more substance from the story.There aren't many movies I've seen that really showcase just how vastly gorgeous the countryside of New Zealand really is, especially one that was made by a native from said island. In addition to being a well crafted movie on its own, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a thoroughly entertaining flick with enough humor and pathos to blend in with the character's journey. If you're a fan of Taika Waititi's work and are yet to see this or if you'd like to get a good flavor of New Zealand cinema, this one should totally be up your alley. After all, it ain't everyday you live the life of wilderpeople."

Everything about this movie from the writing to the acting is stellar. It is one of the best movies we have seen in a long time.

" One of those films you can't help but love!
",-0.756,0.9871,2020-12-09 00:00:00,8,"There really is something special about Taika Waititi which makes his films irresistible. Jojo Rabbit is one of my favourite films of recent times, and so I had no reservations at all about jumping into Hunt for the Wilderpeople.It was everything I was expecting. Absolutely bonkers, intelligent, heart warming, meaningful, enjoyable, poignant and beautiful.Most of the screen time was dedicated to Sam Neill and Julian Dennison's characters, which was great as both performances were exceptional. The two had such a believable chemistry, and the transformation of the two characters through the film was a joy to watch. Taika is brilliant at crafting unique and engaging characters, and Hunt for the Wilderpeople definitely had its share of them in the supporting cast.The story was really engaging, nicely paced, and scripted to perfection.Taika's direction was superb. He managed to capture the vastness and beauty of the New Zealand landscape, while also managing to hone in on the personal and close story of the two central characters. It was a feast for the eyes for sure.The humour also hit the mark for me. This isn't an outright comedy at all, so don't expect a laugh a minute, but it injects humour in all the right places and all the right amounts.A fantastic film!"

",-0.0084,0.9318,2020-10-29 00:00:00,5,"I'm a bit baffled by all the fantastic reviews. Maybe Hulu edited out the best parts? I don't know. I found it cute and interesting. Nice scenery. Aside from Sam Neill's portrayal of the uncle, the characters are broad and one-dimensional. The young man starring as Ricky is fine, but doesn't have much emotional range. Maybe that's what the director wanted. It's a good little movie, but I certainly wouldn't rave about it as so many people seem to."
" A great job by Taika Waititi, his cinematographer, and the crew
",0.6249,0.978,2020-10-25 00:00:00,10,"Waititi isn't trying to encroach on Wes Anderson's space, but if this movie were to be pitted against any of Anderson's creations, Hunt for the Wilderpeople would mop the floor with Anderson. Beats him at his own game of Wes-styled framing and shots and Wes-styled soundtracksTaika has managed to find a set of:
Killer soundtrack
Killer cinematography
Killer humour and jokes
Killer cast
and knits all of it together very organically into one really funny, feel-good comedy.For most of movies that I rate a 10, I expect to watch something profound about the narrative and, hopefully , original about the plot. Yet, despite this movie having nothing profound in the plot (it's pretty in line with your average dad-who-doesn't-want-a-pet-gets-a-pet-and-grows-to-love-the-pet story) the execution is flawless and the humor is well-paced.Very authentic, great cast, super easy to suspend disbelief.

It was Hunt for the Wilderpeople that started my interest in Taika Waititi, as well as Thor: Ragnarok before Jojo Rabbit. Those are the three movies I've seen by him so far. He's definitely the funniest guy from New Zealand and one of my favorite filmmakers. Now, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, I would say, is probably the funniest movie I've ever watched, especially if it's from New Zealand, excluding any superhero comedy movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and Thor: Ragnarok. Taika had a short cameo in the movie, which was quite hilarious. The directing from Taika Waititi is very stylish and full of wacky fun. The performances of Julian Dennison as Ricky Baker and Sam Neill as Hector Faulkner were very impressive, as well as their chemistry and their adventure throughout the movie is entertaining. The humor throughout the movie is also wickedly funny and quirky at the same time, which will leave you laughing out loud and crack yourself up.. You could almost quote some of the lines. It also doesn't just have comedy, it also has some charm and adventure that you can enjoy, as well as some fast pacing. With a charming cast and filmmaker, as well as wacky fun humor, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, I think, is probably the funniest movie I've ever watched and also my favorite movie by Taika Waititi. 9.5/10."

Young Dennison is remarkable, with a cutting deadpan delivery that rivals Rebel Wilson. Sam Neill is the grouchy heart, delivering one of his finest performances. Add dozens of cracking one liners and some truly spectacular New Zealand scenery and you've got a sweet indie gem."

Thankfully HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE is far more like the former than the latter; it's a fun adventure-style movie that boasts an effectively small scale and some wonderfully endearing characters who bring the story to life very well, particularly Julian Dennison who gives a stand-out turn as the child lead. Sam Neill excels as the grizzled straight man while the jokes come thick and fast and a high proportion of them hit home. What's not to love?"

It's a rather odd movie, in that the boy and the father and mother figures feel comic but quite real whereas the rest of the characters are broad and cartoonish. I found this a very distracting approach that prevented the movie from fully committing to either being a touching comedy drama or a wild burlesque.The cast is good and there are a number of good scenes, but the movie isn't nearly as effective as either of director Taia Waititi's other boy-based movies, Boy, and Jojo Rabbit.It's not a bad movie, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it."

While Hector, played by Sam Neil, teaches the young boy about wildlife, the guy teaches lessons about today's world and pop culture. This film is less funny for Waititi, it is more about life, about relationships with each other. Ricky's figure just craves one family for nothing else. You'll find that, too, but the guardianship gets in and they want to take you back to the correctional facility. The relationship between the two characters is well structured, neither suppressing the other. The film's humor is more based on figuring out the contrasts between the two characters, so we can follow the two unfortunate frantic chases along with crying and laughing.The film is about responsibility for each other and ourselves, trust, exclusion from society."

The central characters of Hec and Ricky are so well drawn, and it was an amazing performance for a kid. Sam Neill was of course the consummate professional. Also, the actor portraying Paula (No child left behind!) was so convincing that she landed the part of a sadistic guard at an Australian refugee camp in 'Stateless'. Say no more!

Despite what sounds like a very serious, dreary premise, there's a lot of innocent joy, moments of pure brightness and continuous good humor in Hunt for the Wilderpeople. While they evade pursuit in the Kiwi wilds, Ricky (the adoptee in question) stands up for himself and earns a place in the old man's heart, plus a dash of respect, without losing any of the magnetic, irreverent qualities that make him so much fun to watch. Youthful Julian Dennison is a great fit for the part, playing the hard-edged wannabe thug with a straight face while smoothly indulging the sillier ticks and quirks that make it clear he's still young at heart. Sam Neill, nearly unrecognizable beneath a thick white beard and thicker local accent, makes a fine addition as his gruff, prickly counterpart; a bitter, lonesome man who still harbors the spark of warmth beneath several prohibitive outer layers. Sweet and genuine, effortlessly funny and smoothly charming, it's partly Napoleon Dynamite, partly Wes Anderson and partly its own thing entirely."

The film features a typical strong performance from Sam Neill, but the young lead Julian Dennison is also fantastic. Waititi has a knack for finding true gems for child actors and knows how to get standout performances from them. This film is full of the humor and charm you'd expect from Waititi but also delves deeper into the human issues faced by youth growing up in out of home care. It is a touching feel good story without being over the top cheesy and beautifully filmed in remote locations of the New Zealand wilderness. Standout film, highly recommended."

The movie begins strongly but falls off very fast. It's not funny, the acting in some scenes is bad and the score feels out of place. In many instances the movie tries to be funny by being over the top but it just does not work. It's also really bad at showing how much time has elapsed. At various points in the movie the characters have to say how much time has passed between scenes because it's not illustrated visually. There are some moments that are almost funny and some moments that are a bit emotional but these moments are too few and far between to make me like this movie. All in all it's a waste of time."

The movie begins with Ricky arriving to his new foster house which is a little huntsman house located in dense bushes in New Zealand.Bella(Rima Te Wiata) and Hec(Sam Neill) are his new ""foster parents"".At first it was hard for ricky to feel like it was his ""home"" and to adapt to the situation.
After some time Ricky felt more at home and had better relations between Bella and Hec,a tragic and unexpected event got in the way.The event led to Paula Faulkner(Rachel House) from the Child welfare take Ricky back to Juvenile or to look for a new foster home.Ricky is really mad and disagrees to go back.So what Ricky does is he escapes with his stuff to the bushes alone.After some hours Ricky wanders and gets ""lost"".Because Hector new Ricky is not going to do well alone in the wild forests,he went for him.They finally met up.They all decide that they have nothing to lose so the escape and hide in the bushes starts the whole series of the adventures of Ricky and Hec.After some time in the bushes it turns out that Ricky does really well in difficult conditions.Between Ricky and Hec a ""male friendship"" is born.
It's a film which we cannot miss out on.It made on me a very big impression.The movie looks phenomenal and beautiful and the New Zealand nature is stunning.
The movie for me is a story of a hard friendship between rough Hector and eccentric Ricky,but there is one thing that unites them-it's the need of acceptance and being loved as they are both orphans.
There is only one thing that makes this movie unique is the absurd sense of humor.
The movie is funny,intelligent and unique.Filing the whole and something i admired in this movie is the music which perfectly gives the movie the NZ theme.For me it makes a big difference.
If you haven't watch this amazing movie, i strongly recommend!!!"

" Very entertaining
",0.4927,0.9936,2020-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Hilarious, fascinating, heart-warming, touching and action packed, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a New Zealand adventure comedy-drama from 2016. Movie directed, produced and written by Taika Waititi. The movie was based on a book by Barry Crump - Wild pork and watercress.
This film is about a thirteen year old boy named Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison), who's life was, changing from one foster family too another. He's biggest dream was to become a gangster in the future.
At the beginning of this feature we see a beautiful view of New Zealand and later Ricky who is delivered to his new foster family, an old couple, Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Hector (Sam Neill). Bella is a very caring and energetic person. She is giving a lot of attention to Ricky and surrounds him with love. They connect quickly and she wins his trust. Hector on the other hand was a grumpy person and preferred his own company. When Ricky finally has a normal life with a loving family, something happens that forces Ricky to run away and when Hector finds him, they begin their journey full of adventures, mostly running away from the police and hiding from the world.
The movie is set in a beautiful country, New Zealand. I was so happy that Taika Waititi decided to show the spectacular nature of New Zealand. During the movie when we have short breaks from the action and even during the most important parts, we can observe how beautiful is this island so far away from me in Poland.The music soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Some of the songs are so well chosen, that the words kind off match with the scene. The funniest part was Ricky's birthday song, which was very surprising, original and comical.The characters are very well created, they seemed real, and because of that every sad scene was even more sad and I felt like I was affected by that even too.
The actors did a wonderful job they created such realistic characters and It didn't feel fake like I said earlier I felt that there were real people and not acting. Sam Neill is a popular actor and did a good job but Julian Dennison despite not having such a big acting experience, he did a marvellous job and in my opinion his acting was as good as a professional adult actor."

The main themes we can see in the movie are: comedy,adventure and a little bit of drama.The main actors of this movie are Julian Dennison who plays the main role Ricky Baker and Sam Neil who plays Hector. The movie starts with a scene where Ricky Baker comming to his new home to live with Bella and Hector which are his new foster parents.Ricky has always been a trouble maker.When Ricky first starts to live with Hector and Bella he couldn't addapt to his new life but after some time he finally starts to build a relationship with Bella, but on the other hand Hector ignores Ricky and is not interested in building a relationship with him. As the movie continues the child service officer Paula Hall(Rachel House) wants to take Ricky back, but he refuses and runs away to the jungle with Hector. Ricky and Hector are going through a lots of up and downs but at least Hector is finally building a relationship with Ricky. The budget of this movie was only 2.5 million USD and almost the entire film was shot by using only one camera. It took only 5 weeks to filmed The hunt of the wilderpeople . In my opinion the main actors played their roles great, especially Julian Dennison(Ricky Baker). We can see that he needed to played multiple emotions and Rachel House(Paula Hall). The movie it's self was also very funny and had a lot of jokes which made the film even better. The movie was also divided into chapters which in my opinion was really creative.RECOMMENDATIONSIn my opinion the movie is really great! I really enjoyed watching it. Hunt of the wilderpeople is a good movie to watch with friends or family. The only thing which could have been better was filming of it,I think that if the movie was shot with multiple cameras it would be better.Althoug the movie was funny and had a lot of jokes but it's not the funniest movie you can watch ,because it had also some sad and dramatic scenes.I personaly rate this movie a 8.5/10. ‚ò∫"
" Great film
",0.6249,0.9698,2020-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a movie, that was directed by Taika Waititi. It is based on a novel called Wild Pork and the Watercress written by Berry Crump. The film was set in different locations, including the Central Plateau and the Waitakere Ranges in New Zealand. The adaptation features Julian Dennison, Sam Neill and Rachel House. The soundtrack in the movie is an Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by Moniker, that was written especially for Hunt for the Wilderpeople. The adventure comedy-drama focuses on many relationship based themes and issues.The tale centers on a boy called Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) who is a trouble maker, and is considered a ""real bad egg"". Because of that, as well as his past, he struggles to find a stable home. That is until he meets his foster parents: Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Hector (Sam Neill). It's hard for him to adapt to his new home at first, despite Bella's efforts. Unfortunately, after he starts settling in, he is forced to go on an adventure with Hector because of a difficult set of circumstances. They need to run away from the authorities and Paula (Rachel House), hunt in order to get food and search for shelter. The plot is fascinating, interesting and overall well-made. Some parts of the movie are touching, some are funny and some are even heart-warming: for example the way that Hector changed from being cold hearted and barely showing any emotion to becoming a likable man.
The actors are talented, therefore the characters are played very well. They are convincing, lively and unique in their own way. The director did a very good job.In conclusion Hunt for the Wilderpeople is light and funny, but has its moments of touching drama and exciting action. It is likeable, charming and just plain fun. I would recommend this coming of age film to people of all ages. It is definitely worth watching. However, it does include a bit of violence. There are scenes where animals are being hunted for and killed, which might not be best for sensitive viewers."
" Majestical
",0.0,0.9783,2020-01-29 00:00:00,8,"A confession. I've never seen Hunt for the Wilderpeople. This feels like a glaring failure on my behalf and it's proved to be the case... it's wonderful! Ricky is a young, bored, orphan boy, who finds himself thrust out of the city's welfare system and into the rural home of Bella & Hector. Things don't go quite according to plan though and Ricky finds himself out in the bush with Hector, as both insular characters begin to find out things about themselves and one another. It's darkly funny, but tongue and cheek comical too. Sam Neil is brilliant as Hector, himself an outcast, not comfortable with society and certainly not at ease with 13 year old hip hop loving Ricky. Julian Dennison as Ricky though is a revelation, a bundle of joy perfectly complementing Neil's weather beaten world view. A series of both heartbreaking and innocent incidents sees them on the run from the ridiculously farcical welfare authorities, resulting in a mix of tenderness and satirical hilarity, wrapped up in an 80s style buddy picture, complete with delightful synth heavy score. As if all that weren't enough, Rhys Derby's cameo is nothing short of perfection... or should that be 'Majestical'."

The dialogues in this film are memorable, the jokes are hilarious with universal appeal strengthening the laughs and they never once overstay their welcome. The performances in this film are brilliant, with Julian Dennison straight up breaking the mold of 'child actors are terrible' by spearheading this hilarious film with full angst, childhood emotional trauma and heartwarming wholesomeness. All this is only complimented by Sam Neil's brilliant emotional mimicry that even with little dialogue, formed a heavy brunt of the film's emotional weight.The plot itself follows an oddball story that spirals into the realms of media madness. All throughout the well-played-out story, we are spoiled with a wealth of brilliant shots of beautiful settings and some memorably clever camera play at work. Aside from the two leads, the film is also littered with quirky side characters that, although not as well fleshed-out as the leads, still leave a hell of an impression with their performances derived from such an amazing script."

I caught this because of the director's latest film, Jojo Rabbit, which was great. This was not as good as JoJo, but nevertheless well worth seeing.I just love the blend of humor and drama approached with realism, not over the top and bad acting, but a realistic approach despite some of the dialogue and situations being someone ridiculous (in a good way).Most directors would tend to make actors force the humor and literally wink into the camera for laughs, but not Taika Waititi, and thank God for that.Go see it for the adventure ride and laugh out loud moments."

He never touched the Boy. I take that stuff very seriously and DO NOT EVEN LYE OR JOKE ABOUT IT.
But it is a fantastic Movie. Oh and the Music, Songs in this Movie was PERFECT. I loved the album in this film it was great.
That Nutball dressed as a tree bush was also very funny and terrific.
That Women Officer in that film hunting down the young boy. She was also funny, nuts, right down to the law, Loved how she Bossed everyone around she was a fantastic woman in charge.
(DO AS I SAY)
I loved that part standing in front of a MAN OFFICER. Yelling at him to get real POLICE MEN to the Job.
He said I am a Policeman. Then she says ya a real one that carries a ""GUN""
He just looks at her and puts his head down and walks away Lol.
That was funny why because of you suck being an Officer ""DUMMY""

I tend to enjoy wacky offbeat comedies and when it comes to plot, the weirder the better for me, so 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' was right up my street.The best thing about this film though has to be the characters. They are deliberately over-the-top/exaggerated based on real-world stereotypes, such as the stroppy kid, incompetent police and the unsympathetic social worker, who was my personal favourite.Entertaining, fun, well-written and well-acted throughout.

Likeable characters, and some unlikeable ones too, all portrayed to perfection. Sam Neil is great as the old Grumble, and the wee boy is an absolute star. And who better to play mad Sam the Bushman than Rhys Darby! That guy is comedy genius. The script is down to earth with a funny and heartwarming dialogue. The pair grow and develop - the story moves ahead without ever running wild. And it all happens to the backdrop of a breathtaking NZ scenery (and they even managed to fit in a nod to LOTR, well played). This is 10 chapters of goodness. Grand storytelling on a humble scale.

" Amazing Film!
",0.6239,0.9982,2019-09-11 00:00:00,10,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) is an epic adventure written and directed by Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director probably most recognized by his works What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). This film is based on the book Wild Pork and Watercress, written by Barry Crump, and stars Sam Neill (Jurassic Park, 1993, Escape Plan, 2013), Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2, 2018), and Rachel House (Moana, 2016).
Hunt for the Wilderpeople alternates between obvious and subtle references to pop culture while updating what it means to be an ""epic adventure"" in today's film industry.
The film's protagonist is teenage boy who has bounced from foster home to foster home until he reaches his last stop before being sent to a juvenile center. His world is uprooted, and he finds himself in the middle of a nationwide manhunt that leads to some personal growth, heartwarming moments, and interesting characters.
This film was an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. Waititi's penchant for natural, comedic dialogue allows you to not only relate to the main characters within the first fifteen minutes, but it allows you to love them as well. The music had a folksy feel to it and the cinematic direction and editing of certain scenes gave me that ""pay attention to this because you will see it later"" feeling and I was not let down.
Hunt for the Wilderpeople does an amazing job referencing pop culture as soon as it starts. The film's main character, Ricky Baker (Dennison), steps out of the back of a police car, dressed in flashy, urban-esque clothing. Not only is his attire inspired by a certain sect of Black American culture, the back of his jacket has the quote, ""All Eyes On Me,"" a reference to rap icon Tupac Shakur's album All Eyez on Me. What's interesting about Waititi's directorial and musical choice to introduce Ricky Baker is that we get an up-close look at the words on the back of Ricky's jacket accompanied by a foreboding musical score that gives a bit of foreshadowing through the character's introduction before we even see his face. Even Ricky's past antics (shown in flashbacks as his new foster parent is briefed on his history), hopes, and dreams are heavily influenced by urban culture and music. During a point where Ricky states his desire to get back to the city, he states his plan to get ""some new gears, become a drug dealer, a rapper, and die in a drive-by."" This is a huge perception of rap culture in America that has spread worldwide where people of other countries often have the common misconception that that lifestyle is what all rappers live.
Throughout the months that pass in the movie, the film shows Ricky and Hector (Neill), go from being at each other's throats to almost inseparable. The best part about the way we learn how much time has passed is that it's through dialogue. Now, one may argue that announcing the passage of time could come off as forced or contrived, but Waititi blends it into the conversation in such a way that is not only natural, but with a sort of dash of exposition to catch us up after we've enjoyed several minutes of the duo's adventures and bickering.
It's because of these things that Hunt for the Wilderpeople is an epic adventure updating the definition of what it means for a film to be an ""epic adventure."" We no longer live in a time where we have to tell stories of old like 300 or Troy or Gladiator because the Greek are not the only people who spent months or years on an adventure. We live in a day and age where epic adventures are happening all around us and Waititi does a great job capturing the one between Ricky Baker and Hector Faulkner. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to have a great laugh (and maybe even a cray) with amazing characters with references to pop culture that almost all of us will understand."
" Heartfelt, Emotional, Beautiful, Hilarious. It's Waititi's best movie yet

The introduction of Julian Dennison as Ricky Backer was great and brought so much genuine talent, humor and personality to the character of Ricky Baker. Sam Neil as Uncle Hec was great too and also had a great performance in the film, It's been a while since I've seen him and it was great just to see him back on the screen again.Every character in the film is unique and entertaining including Waititi himself who appears in the movie. Taika himself acheives a great blend of comedy against emotion, sadness and loss and acheives a sense of magic and wonder through his showcase of the native bushland.It's an incredible Kiwi film, Go see it"

It starts off as an offbeat comedy (think Eagle vs Shark) but then moves towards a more Hollywood friendly tone, but is a bit confused about which style it wants to be as the story unfolds.
Can't fault the dialogue or performances and it is obvious that Taika Waititi loved this film as there is a lot of heart on display throughout."

" Sweet and Genuine, Effortlessly Funny and Smoothly Charming
",0.8658,0.9836,2019-02-11 00:00:00,8,"A difficult foster child finally finds his place on a remote New Zealand farm, runs into some tough luck and goes on the lam with a stern, stoic older man who makes no attempt to disguise his contempt for the boy. Despite what sounds like a very serious, dreary premise, there's a lot of innocent joy, moments of pure brightness and continuous good humor in Hunt for the Wilderpeople.While they evade pursuit in the Kiwi wilds, Ricky (the adoptee in question) stands up for himself and earns a place in the old man's heart, plus a dash of respect, without losing any of the magnetic, irreverent qualities that make him so much fun to watch. Youthful Julian Dennison is a great fit for the part, playing the hard-edged wannabe thug with a straight face while smoothly indulging the sillier ticks and quirks that make it clear he's still young at heart. Sam Neill, nearly unrecognizable beneath a thick white beard and thicker local accent, makes a fine addition as his gruff, prickly counterpart; a bitter, lonesome man who still harbors the spark of warmth beneath several prohibitive outer layers.Sweet and genuine, effortlessly funny and smoothly charming, it's partly Napoleon Dynamite, partly Wes Anderson and partly its own thing entirely."

" Hunt for the Wilderpeople
",0.0,0.9951,2018-11-25 00:00:00,9,"Having loved the only previous movie I saw directed by Taika Waititi, ''What we do in the shadows'', I decided to give this one a go after having it in my watchlist for what seems like forever, and I was not disappointed.
The first thing I noticed while watching Hunt for the Wilderpeople, was that I couldn't fit it into any of the usual genres, and I couldn't figure out if I was supposed to laugh my guts out or to cry like a child for the duration of the movie. In the end it ended up being a bit of both, an emotional roller-coaster, full of incredibly funny bits, such as the cameo of the director Waititi in the role of an eccentric priest, as well as really sad moments, when the comedy of the characters' actions hits a great dose of uncompromising reality, and the two things happening very close to each other somehow accentuates both.
Speaking of the characters, the acting is superb, and the casting seemed perfect, as everyone did an amazing job at selling their part and making the viewer feel close to them.
One of the things that surprised me the most though, was the cinematography department, which not only succeeded in portraying the tone of the cold seasons' bush, but exceeded my expectations in doing so. The movie's tone is set since the beginning by a cold dramatic filter, which does its job in contrasting the funny bits in a way that makes them even funnier, and by the end of the movie we feel comfortable in that mesmerizing colour palette. Some of the scenes in this movie are a wonder to look at, and some are very creative too, the first ones that come to mind being the boar hunt at the very beginning, and the rotating scene of the hunt for the Wilderpeople towards the end.
The music in the movie never stands out too much, which is not necessarily bad, as it does a decent job at supporting the scenes.
In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie for anyone in the mood for a great adventure, full of ups and downs, laughter, tears and a little advice on how to cope with the lows of life."
" Bewilder(people)ing and Heartwarming
",0.4767,0.985,2018-10-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a kooky blend of New Zealand sass and off-kilter heartwarming familial bonding. When troubled youth Ricky is sent to a farm in the Bush as his last option before Juvenile Detention, he comes to live with curmudgeon Hec and his kindly wife, Bella. When Bella dies, Ricky flees into the wild lands and is pursued, and eventually bonds with Hec, as they survive the perils of the wilderness, and of a life on the run from the law. In a fantastically oddball coming of age tale, director Taika Waititi presents a unique point of view on the challenges of growing up as a child in the welfare system in NZ. As the antisocial and set in his ways Hec opens his heart, and gangster-wannabee Ricky learns to put aside appearances and work with integrity, the movie presents fulfilling character progression alongside gorgeous natural scenery. Lachlan Milne was in charge of Cinematography and created a visually delicious film in line with his best known stunning work: Stranger Things. I truly felt the tough love form between the pair and was emotionally satisfied by this three-course meal of a film."

Don't read too many reviews, or catch any spoilers. Just go for it and let it move you.
I didn't expect to laugh so hard I was grabbing my stomach, or almost starting to cry the next moment.

Its endearing and relatively realistic central relationship thankfully always comes first. The film is just an entertaining time throughout, an eclectic amalgamation of farcical comedy and character growth, and it's an incredibly unique experience that never takes the easy or expected route, in terms of neither its plot nor its laughs. This makes every weird, oddly cohesive moment all the sweeter, especially when it collates into an end result as fantastic as it is. 8/10"

I watched it and there were a handful of really funny moments and yet it was lacking in emotion so much that it had so much potential yet fell so short. Each character as hard as I tried to feel some fort of connection to them I simply couldn't. It's the sort of movie that I continued watching waiting to see what would happen next. Lovely scenery about sums it. The acting was as the script was meant to be I'm guessing...I don't know what the secret ingredient that it was missing but whatever it is really caused this one to flop when it shouldn't have.
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9041,2018-08-04 00:00:00,9,"Funny, moving, absurdly funny, picturesque and quintessentially Kiwi, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is an incredible movie.Julian Dennison (""Deadpool 2"") plays Ricky Baker, a troubled foster kid who moves in with a childless family Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Hector (Sam Neill). After Bella unexpectedly dies, Ricky and Hector team up to escape Paula, the relentless Child Welfare lady (Rachel House). It escalated into a hilariously ridiculous car chase between Ricky, Hector and the police. There's a couple of brilliant cameos: writer/director Taika Waititi as a priest and Rhys Darby (Murray from ""Flight of the Conchords"") as conspiracy theorist Psycho Sam.Even if you only watch it for the beautiful New Zealand scenery as Ricky and Hector travel, ""Wilderpeople"" is highly recommended."
" Fun and different!

This movie doesn't have a lot of story, but the characters and dialogue are funny. It's got heart and some really silly moments as well. A great role for Sam Neil amongst a lot of pretty good newcomers, plus the beauty of New Zealand."
" Purely and utterly delightful!
",0.6857,0.9874,2018-07-20 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to explore the rest of Taika Waititi's filmography after loving everything he did on Thor: Ragnarok and decided to watch this one with my mom. (**THOR: RAGNAROK SPOILER**: Sam Neill who plays Hector, actually has a cameo in a play about Loki and portrays the actor who play's Odin) 
This film was so quirky with the concept of Ricky Baker, a troubled teen who is in the New Zealand foster care system sent to live with couple Bella and Hector, who live in the vast New Zealand bush. Ricky Baker had never felt comfortable in his previous foster homes, and warms up to Bella and Hector, whom he dubs his ""Aunt"" and ""Uncle."" Bella treats him with such love and kindness and even gifts him with a dog for his birthday that he names Tupac after the rapper of the same name. Suddenly as Ricky begins to truly enjoy living with Bella and Hector, Bella passes away. Taika Waititi makes a very memorable and hilarious cameo as a priest at Bella's funeral. Ricky is informed that social services will be coming to pick him up and take him to a new foster care home, since it was Bella's idea to take Ricky in and not Hector's. Knowing this, Ricky decides to run away into the bush with Tupac and fakes his own death. This is discovered by the scene stealing Rachel House as Paula Hall, Ricky's social worker and she and the police, as well as Hector make their own searches for Ricky. Ricky and Hector end up finding each other and sticking together for several months on the run from Paula and the police. Several run-ins with zany characters including the approximately named Psycho Sam and several hunters all end in a police chase that leads to Hector getting arrested for allegedly kidnapping Ricky based on misinterpreted statements Ricky told the hunters that Hector was making him do things he didn't want to do. Ricky eventually reunites with Hector after a while and upholds his promise of teaching Hector how to read. 
Overall, this was another zany, brilliant story from Taika Waititi that is well-paced, well-shot, and isn't overly filled with deliberate jokes and humor like Thor: Ragnarok; as the humor mainly comes from how the story plays out and doesn't need to be relied on by a comic-relief character. Although, Rachel House and Rhys Darby who plays Psycho Sam are very humorous and can be seen as comic relief, they just let the jokes flow naturally and don't feel forced to tell them."

This movie is amazing, from beautiful scenery and authentic sets, I was totally drawn in. The mood established thought the film is on a level of comedy so hilarious and so balanced with the overal theme that I can hardly handle it. The casting is perfect and all the characters seemed written just for the people portraying them. I love everything about this movie and can't recommend it enough."
" Conventional but enjoyable
",0.5927,0.9451,2018-05-12 00:00:00,7,"Ricky (Julian Dennison) is an aboriginal, delinquent teenager who is transferred among foster homes in urban New Zealand. His newest foster assignment is in a farm near the wilderness. After a series of mishaps and misunderstandings, Ricky and the man of the house (Sam Neill) live in the bush as they are hunted down by government authorities.There is an early disappointment in the film when a likeable, eccentric character disappears too soon. Also, the plot device of an ""old grouch"" unlikely bonding with a misunderstood teenage boy has been done many, many times before.Despite these complaints, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is still an enjoyable movie. This is mainly because of Dennison's and Neill's performances - both individually and in their mutual chemistry. The film also gives credibility to a repeated theme: that bureaucrats rarely (if ever) give outcasts the help they need but still try to dominate their lives. Near the end, there is also a nostalgic reminder of ""Thelma and Louise"".With some good humour and the beauty of the New Zealand wilderness, this movie comes off as rather gratifying."

",0.0,0.9848,2018-03-31 00:00:00,8,"It's great when you come across a film that you have barely heard of and it turns out to be a hidden gem. Netflix and Amazon are great for these kind of films and Hunt for the Wilderpeople really is a cracking little film.This is the story of city kid Ricky , who gets a fresh start in the New Zealand countryside. He quickly finds himself at home with his new foster family. When a tragedy strikes that threatens to ship Ricky to another home, both he and Hec go on the run in the bush. As a national manhunt ensues, the newly branded outlaws must face their options: go out in a blaze of glory or overcome their differences and survive as a family. We all know the acting qualities that Sam Neill has and he is great in this but the star of this particular show is Julian Dennison who plays Ricky. Rarely have I seen comedy timing from a kid like he has in this film. 
I laughed out loud several times during this movie which is unusual for me and comedies. 
The one liners are brilliant and that credit has to go to New Zealand director and screenplay writer Taika Waititi .
I usually cringe when I hear that a movie is ""feel good"" but not in this case.

I didn't hate the kid and Sam Neil was very good as Hector. There was a very believable bond between Ricky and Hector, and when they had the ""get mad at each other and leave"" scene, it didn't feel forced (partly because of the subject matter) and I loved that it didn't go on for too long. All the cinematography was fantastic. It was very funny and I love the kind of dark sense of humor that the movie had. I think this had a great soundtrack! and it's not just great songs that already existed and wasn't composed for the movie (though there was a lot in there), also the composed music is really good. It gives off a very mysterious feeling. All the characters were very likable, and not stereotypes (except ""psycho sam""), and it was great. I wouldn't give it a 10/10 like some people are, because it has some problems. There was some stereotypes in the movie, (An example being ""psycho sam"" being the conspiracy theorist stereotype) I think there should have been some more time devoted to the relationship between Ricky and Bella, and I think the plot was kinda predictable. But, I still think this movie was very fun and enjoyable, and I'll definitly recommend it. i give this a 8/10"

He's on his last chance to make his new foster family work and finds a tough challenge in old man Hector. ""Uncle Heck"" played by Sam Neil is the dogged bastard who is matched only in sheer stubbornness by this kid. Shit gets real in the NZ jungle and this unlikely pairing become a hilarious duo on a ride through life taking the rest of the country with them. Really the film can be summed up in just one word. Character. What the film lacks in post production and cinematography it makes up for in screenplay and charm. I don't think it's Taika Waititi best direction it is an an example of New Zealand's funniest and finest and for 2 and a half million bucks I doubt anyone could have done better."

" This director and his stars certainly have the ""knack"" for a great film
",0.7579,0.9958,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"From New Zealand's best director, Waititi ('Eagle Vs Shark', 'Boy', 'What We Do in the Shadows'), comes 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', which is a title that doesn't make much sense, but when explained with kid logic, it does - ""Wildebeest walk thousands of miles. Feels like we've walked that may too. That must make us Wilderpeople!"" Simple premise - Ricky (Dennison) is an orphan adopted by Bella (Te Wiata) and Hector (Neill), but when Bella dies unexpectedly, Child Services want to put Ricky back in 'juvie', so he runs away into the bush, where Hector has to protect him.There's so many things to like about this film - the score is great, the little chapter subtitles keep the pace moving, the visuals are stunning (or ""majestical""), being filmed on New Zealand's north island, there's plenty of great jokes/quips and, most importantly, there's lots of heart. There's some nice sentimental moments and some sad ones, handled equally as well as the comedy. The bond formed by Hector and Ricky isn't forced or fake - it happens naturally and you become really attached to the characters, since it's mostly the two of them throughout.But there's still some time for some good support cast - Paula (House) as the 'Terminator'-like Child Services Officer hunting them down, Waititi himself as the priest and ""Psycho"" Sam (Darby). Probably my only criticism is that the film needed more Rhys Darby! It's great to see Neill understated and slowly shed his shell, but the film belongs to Dennison - chirpy, optimistic in spite of his ordeals and genuinely funny."
" ""You're pretty likable.""
",0.4939,0.9201,2017-11-26 00:00:00,5,"That sums it up. I expected a lot more. It starts off fine, but then evolves into a chase film that they didn't seem to know how or when to end. The main characters are fine, except the boy. They make him bounce back & forth from ""wise & sensitive"" to obnoxious & obtuse. He goes back & forth. Over & over. It is one of those films where I get to a point & think ""This thing has peaked. I should just shut it off now & remember it better for it."" I decided to the watch the end, but if you decide to shut it off when they leave Sam, you'll be fine.You know, Bella was probably the best character. And then ... gone."

Ricky refuses to go back and runs away, ultimately sparking a national manhunt for him and Hector.Sweet, funny movie, written and directed by Taika Waititi who wrote and directed the superb vampire-comedy, What We Do In The Shadows (plus, more recently, directed Thor: Ragnarok). Starts slowly, with only a smattering of humour and limited engagement. However, from a point it ramps up. The humour comes thicker and faster, you start to root for the characters and the plot becomes quite interesting. Some great scenes - the ones involving Psycho Sam (Rhys Darby) being the pick of the bunch.Overall, not too powerful nor poignant, but very funny, interesting and full of heart."

But then they kill off the most interesting character (the aunt) and what you get after that is a New Zealand version of ""Up"". It was so refreshing to see a female character with such humor and joy and rich personality like the aunty character. And then you are left with the clich√© of an old grumpy man and a problematic fat kid, that didn't lose a single pound during God knows how many months of living in the bushes. OK, the story is alright, but the jungle chase gets just boring at some point and the dialogues weren't that interesting as in the beginning. The movie ends with a spectacular car chase with explosions like it was some cheap action movie. That was quite disappointing for me. But nevertheless, it's an amusing movie to watch."

",0.6697,0.9884,2017-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople is Taika Waititi's fourth feature film, and arguably his finest one. I love this movie: the New Zealand scenery and cast of this film not only helps with the film's broad yet culturally specific appeal, it tells story that is hilarious, touching and very memorable. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a comedy-drama about family and how social misfits only truly understand each other. Ricky Baker is adopted by Bella and Hec. And things only get more complicated and wacky when Bella passes away, leaving Hec to take care of Ricky himself.The film takes surprising turns when you least expect it to. It's still very much a comedy but one that takes emotional risks for the sake of the story rather than shock value. Taika Waititi based this film off a book, that may have been so niche that it doesn't have its own wikipedia page. It's great we live in a world where a director like Waititi gives life to a story where the world doesn't realise it wants it or needs it. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is one such film.If you want a film that provides belly-laughs and great characters, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is surprisingly easy to get into. Watch the film; just see it asap. It's a Kiwi-delight and one of 2016's best movies."

Based on the book ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" by Barry Crump, its unique charm and humour boost the appeal of what would have been an otherwise generic bonding story.Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison), a juvenile delinquent, goes on the run from child protective services in the New Zealand bush. Reluctantly joining Ricky is his surly foster uncle Hector (Sam Neill), who is forced to bond with his nephew while trying to find ways for them to survive in the wilderness. Eventually, a nationwide manhunt is launched by the police to swiftly bring the two of them to justice.Funny, poignant, and well-cast, Hunt for the Wilderpeople revels in a unique, idyllic quirkiness that could have only come out of somewhere like New Zealand. The film's dramatic moments always hit home and never feel like they were inserted merely for cheap emotional effect. The humour, which is very dry and tongue-in-cheek, frequently adds to the film's likability and unconventional tone. Newcomer Julian Dennison shines as Ricky Baker, a rebellious young boy with a heart of gold and Sam Neill plays off him quite well as his irritable foster uncle.I rate it 8/10"

Humble performances, unbelievable direction by Taika Waititi (he's directing Thor: Ragnarok as well, so my expectations for that movie just increased a lot), beautiful soundtrack, amazing humor and a great message for kids these days.I'll start with the cast: Sam Neill and Julian Dennison are incredible! They're the film's engine and without them, everything would crumble. Humble, honest and captivating, they give great performances that kept me invested in the plot and in their relationship, which is the main focus of this movie. They're so much different and the constant bickering between them made me want more and more from them. It gives a truly heartfelt message for kids that no matter how tough growing up is, you'll always have someone to help you along the way, even if they seem to be the complete opposite from you.I love the supporting characters, especially Psycho Sam (Rhys Darby), I laughed so much with his scenes. I didn't like this guy that kept asking the kid for a selfie, he's super annoying, but thank God he's in the movie for only a couple of minutes. The partnership between Andy (Oscar Kightley) and Paula (Rachel House) is also very funny and, by the end, they're the main source of humor that Taika Waititi knew how to explore.Talking about the man, what an amazing filmmaker! I'm so humbly grateful for his work, he controls this movie in such a wonderful and masterful way. The editing is spot on, the characters are greatly developed, the violent scenes are well shot for a NR-rated installment, the comedy is so good and the soundtrack is delightful. I have no flaws with his work, it's perfect!The only issues I have with this film are the sometimes slow pacing and the forced ending. I don't believe that a certain character would behave in the manner that it is showed, it feels forced so that the movie can actually have an ending and it kind of ruined what could have been an A+.Still, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is one of the best comedies of the year, it delivers a beautiful and heartfelt message through two honest performances, a perfect directing by Taika Waititi (don't forget this name!), great humor and a wonderful soundtrack.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"

I put it on because Sam Neil was in it and he did not disappoint. the movie is funny, sad, moving, exciting, and silly in equal measure. It is a rare event when a movie creates something really special and this one achieves it. I do not want to over egg it but if it holds the attention of my teenage daughters and they say it was good then something special has just happened. One even later told her friends it was her favorite movie.A warning for those with younger viewers as there are some verbal references of a sexual nature and one scene of violence towards an wild animal.

It sports hilarious performances from Julian Dennison (Ricky) and Sam Neill (Hec), however, I wanted to talk about Taika Waititi's direction in this film.At times, his work reminded me a bit of Wes Anderson, with its use of jump cuts to guide the viewer through specific scenes. By doing this, Waititi speeds up the pace of the film. It is not a frantic pace, but one that highlights the best parts of what it has to offer, such as the first birthday party Ricky shares with his new foster parents or the scene with him dancing in the forest. Waititi's direction highlights those hilarious moments so well. I also really enjoyed the way he framed specific characters. He tended to start with a character in the center of the frame - specifically in a close up - and fill out the rest of the frame from there. I thought that focus drew my attention to the center of the frame well. The story of Hunt for the Wilderpeople is heart-warming, hilarious one that is only made better by director Taika Waititi's stamp."

To play off Sam Neil like that? Respect is due to him.But it also has a tight script and if you liked the other mentioned movie, you will very likely go for the humor in this one too. It's not PC and it may bother some people who are easily offended. That being said, it doesn't mean it has no heart. Quite the opposite is the case, I'd argue it has a lot of heart.

I'm not so sure this boy was actually acting or just having a very good time! All of the cast were perfect, every face fit the bill.The script - not sure how much came straight from the book, possibly quite a bit - but this was truly funny! The rarest thing in a movie ever these days is anything that is genuinely actually funny. The moving moments were smart, direct and quick and all of the actors knew how to carry these moments well. I can only think that the director was superbly working all the moments, that this very, very clever, funny film was filled with care and attention and lots of remarkable talent.I couldn't help myself, I watched it two days in a row.

Hec pursues him and, on finding him, breaks his ankle and can't move: the two are stuck in position for some weeks. And everyone assumes that taciturn loner Hec....This is a small film, mostly a two-hander, treading a moderately well-trodden path (see also Up). Julian Dennison is a joy as the tubby Ricky, both streetwise and na√Øve. And the heavily bearded Hec, looking and sounding like Hugo Weaving is played by Sam Neill. And it's a revelation. The part is miles away from anything he's done before, and he is terrific.The film is funny, suspenseful, heart-warming, sad, and beautiful to look at.Heartily recommended."

But it's also the tiny things that the director adds which makes it a little bit better like the use of the chapters to the set the tone for them series of acts in that specific chapter or the montage at the start giving a quick overview of the boy's misfits in urban life, sometimes the little things do matter.On the other hand though this film isn't perfection or a masterpiece(you shouldn't expect it to be)the pacing feels 'awkward' or 'misplaced' which sometimes destroys the atmosphere of the film. But it's exactly what you expect it to be, which can always be good sometimes."

I'm assuming it's a unique brand of New Zealand humor and it's done quite well.Given enough time, the film could possibly move to cult status due to the bigger-than-life character villains who seem to take their establishment jobs far too serious.The plot may deliver a few over the top stereotypes yet there's also many unexpected gems. An off-beat spin to the typical coming of age story for a lad who's had a rough start to life. But rather than take a dark and brooding tone, the film uses indigenous storytelling and pop culture influences as the boy's escapism tools. When he lands in yet another foster home, he finds a surrogate family willing to accept his odd behavior. Yet, the happiness doesn't last and tragedy strikes again. Rather than go back to the authorities, the boy decides to fake his death. This is a lad used to running on imagination rather than common sense. So he decides life in the wilderness is a better option to yet another foster or group home. Unfortunately, he's ill-equip to handle the rough terrain let alone hunt. The rest of his journey unfolds in unpredictable ways although we know eventually he will get caught. Most viewers will probably root for a happy ending or at least envision him escaping his fate. All I will say is the film doesn't disappoint, which is a good thing.These days international and indie films are on my watchlist as I'm a bit jaded towards Hollywood and it's CGI regurgitation formulas. I'm still trying to figure out why there's a need to make both Suicide Squad and Dr. Strange. One would have sufficed! While The Hunt for the Wilderpeople is not a complicated story, the delivery of the story is both fun and entertaining to watch.Well done NZ. Well done."
" Makes you feel happy

It's silly, funny, touching and sweet, but never saccharin.It's jam packed with irreverent humour, in-jokes at New Zealand's expense and pokes fun at outsiders preconceptions of Kiwi's.The characters are also all great. It's probably my favourite role I've seen Sam Neil play in a long time. He is brilliant. The supporting cast are likewise, excellent. Rachel House's child protection officer, has some of the funniest lines and plays what could have easily been an over-the-top character, on just the right side of mad. Her moment on Kiwi breakfast TV had me rolling on the floor.The star of the show however, is Julian Dennison's gangster orphan. Who's crimes include such heinous acts as, loitering and throwing stuff. He is effortlessly funny throughout and very likable. He is able to handle subtle humour, sensitivity and drama in a way that would put many actors 3 times his age to shame.The locations too are beautiful, really showing off NZ's landscape.If you like comedy with a bit of heart and don't mind silliness on occasion, this movie is right up your street. It's funny and touching and puts most (if not all) the recent U.S efforts to shame.""NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND"""
" Hunt for the Wilder People - A funny comedy, that should have trusted it's characters a little bit more
",0.8176,0.3067,2017-03-29 00:00:00,6,"I wish, Hunt for the Wilder People has had a little bit more trust in it's characters and story. Then it could have been a truly, great film. Unfortunately, Taika Waititi felt the need to crank the humor up to eleventystupid every once in awhile in an otherwise very sincere story. Seeing the polar characters of the 13 year old, overweight kid Ricky and his grumpy foster parent Hector come together and develop their friendship was not only very funny. It was told with respect for the characters. Both actors, veteran Sam Neill and youngster Julian Dennison, did an awesome job in portraying these misfits, who both seem to have no place in society. The movie worked best, when it was just the two of them. Unfortunately, you cannot say the same for the rest of the cast, most notably perhaps for the cameo of director Waititi himself as a minister at a funeral service. He was a caricature and not taken to be serious for any moment. And he was not the only one, who ruined the tone of the movie for me. Paula, the head of child welfare, who was supposed to be the antagonist, also was just laughable. I just couldn't take her serious, she was just preposterous, and that undermined a lot of the story for me. Both Ricky and Hector had real problems: they have been sort of exiled from the rest of the world, they had to deal with some real, personal tragedies and I rooted for them. But this was undermined by characters and plot lines that were not for a single second believable and completely out of place. I wish, the movie had taken it's own convictions a little bit more serious. Then, this could have been a really touching movie. Now, it is more of a farce, that has some real funny moments, two great actors in the middle, but ultimately feels a bit hollow."

The story never prods along. It feels fast paced but not rushed, with just enough time to give each character some depth.Cinematographically, there's some really cool editing in here and some beautiful high production shots of New Zealand's impressive landscape, overlaid by funky 80's tunes.

" An excellent Comedical, Visual and Emotional Adventure !!!
",0.8164,0.9768,2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,"Firstly, I'm so impressed by this film that I couldn't but help to write My First Review on IMDb for a film.The first aspect is the Cinematography of this film. I knew NZ was like a Heaven on Earth, but this movie makes it crystal clear to whomever sees it. Extremely breathtaking 'bushes' spread across millions of hectares.Secondly, the Actors and the Story. The story was based of a Ricky(Julian Dennison) acts brilliantly and fitting as the Fat- orphaned kid who's sort of a Rebel in attitude, adopted by the couple Bella(Rime Te Wiata) & Hector(Sam Niell), both suiting their characters who live in the middle of the breathtaking forests all alone in their comfortable little house. Ricky tries to adjust to his new family, until a tragedy struck them. Hec & Ricky set out on sort of an unexpected expedition, which the Child Welfare services mistake it for Kidnapping and order an National Manhunt longing for several months. Will the Boy & Uncle get away from the clutches of the CWS trying to get hold of the boy and send him to Juvie ?Thirdly, the director, Taika Waititi whose previous work isn't yet aware to me, has done some fitting screenplay with the way scenes are shot in the wild.Lastly, the soundtrack of the movie goes in so well that I keep listening again. Overall, The movie's definitely worth your time as we go on a laughter riot, emotional and visual adventure. P.s. The movie contains a two short bits of killing of wild animals. If you can bear it, It's enjoyable !"

But despite its quirky sensibility and smattering of genuinely delightful humour, the film does fall flat at times, leaving a prevailing sense of desire for emotional stakes and consequences to be further built upon and delved into. Whilst applaudable not to dwell on more tragic moments, more visible reflection from characters and subsequent conflict (such as post-Wild Boar encounter) is noticeably absent. On the other hand, you can understand with the soft approach of the movie this decision, which clearly delights in its light frothiness and affability."

The kid was really great, too. Be prepared to laugh a lot and have your heart warmed as Sam and the kid find their way through their adventures in the outback as well as finding themselves psychologically. The movie is full of outlandish yet completely believable surprises. I haven't laughed this much since Les Visiteurs."

",0.0,0.9744,2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"This is basically a road picture with the difference being that instead of the road, the adventure takes place in the New Zealand wilderness. Sam Neill plays the caretaker of a troubled adolescent boy who has been placed with him and his wife through the foster child program. The wife is out of the picture early on, and thus begins the strange journey into the woods with the state authorities in hot pursuit. The scenery is spectacular and Neill has a Mel Gibson like wise ass quality which works well in the interplay between him and the boy. They meet many odd people along the way, and I am surprised that the film wasn't chosen as one of the nominees for best foreign film for 2016; it is that good. Great acting, smart script and a good soundtrack add up to a really good movie and one of my favorites for 2106."

Hec hurts his foot after finding Ricky lost in the woods. Paula rings the alarm as the police fears Ricky has been taken by Hec. It becomes a large manhunt in the wilds of New Zealand. Ricky calls themselves the Wilderpeople after the wildebeests who migrate long distances.I like the kid despite his sometimes inexplicable bratty behavior. He and Sam Neill have good chemistry. The character Paula Hall does bug me at times. She's trying to be comedic but she's also off-putting even considering she's a villain. There is a joy about the humor that feels real. The kid and Sam deserve a lot of praise.

I really enjoyed this film not just because it was extremely funny, but also because I have lived in New Zealand for a number of years and found it really homely. However even if you are not from New Zealand, this movie will really connect with you on an emotional level and almost feel like home. I found Hunt for the Wilderpeople more enjoyable than Boy (2010), another Taika Waititi movie, since it was faster-paced, had a more definite story line, funnier and contained less swearing. If you're looking for a movie that can make you laugh, cry and laugh some more, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is the movie for you."
" Ninjas! Direwolves! Child Services!
",0.0,0.9885,2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"Okay, so I sat down with 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' today after hearing lots of good word of mouth and enjoying the trailer on Youtube. About fifteen minutes in, I decided I loved it. There was a scene where a Priest makes a catastrophically awful speech which was so funny I had to pause the film so I could calm down and not miss the next few scenes. That speech was made at a funeral for a character who's death was utterly heartbreaking. And essentially, that sums up why 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' works so well. It's a film that mixes bittersweet sentimentality with some genuinely funny moments. There are moments where you'll smile knowingly to yourself, moments where you'll chuckle politely and a few where your stomach muscles will hurt from guffawing so much. There are more laughs in this film than Adam Sandler has managed in the last ten years.The film focuses on juvenile delinquent Ricky Baker as he goes into foster care at a farm house in the New Zealand bush. His new Aunt Bella adores him, while his new Uncle Hector just wants to be left in peace. Events conspire to cast Ricky and Hector into the wilderness together. One injured ankle and a few misunderstandings later, they're at the centre of a manhunt and have to flee because...well, because they didn't choose the Skuxx Life, the Skuxx Life chose them. The end result is a film that's packed with quotable dialogue, a wealth of memorable characters and an infectious sense of humour. This is a movie where there are no cool or commanding personas, everyone is a little bit rubbish. There's an over-zealous child support worker who thinks she's a Terminator, a few Cops who are nowhere near as committed as they should be and a chatty teenage girl with a cheerfully idiotic dad.Most of all though, there's the central duo. Julian Dennison's wayward thirteen year old and Sam Neil's exasperated old-timer make a wonderful lead duo. Neil makes a reluctant father figure, forever struggling against a world full of morons while Dennison's Haiku- writing teen is a great foil. They bicker constantly but inevitably, form a bond over time. But unlike so many similar themed films, their eventual friendship feels genuine. They look and behave like real people, rather than actors abiding by genre conventions. And that makes the experience all the more entertaining.By the time they hook up with the scene-stealing ""Psycho Sam,"" it's only too obvious why 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' has been called one of 2016's best films. It's a warm, engaging and very, very funny jaunt through the forests down under, like an Antipodean 'First Blood' where everybody is just a little bit stupid. The scene where Dennison tries to make a hot water bottle with a camp fire is worth the price of admission alone."
" What a lovely film!
",0.6239,0.9838,2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"A very sweet, touching, fun and silly coming of age film.It was so easy to watch, but still unique and captivating.All elements were thoughtfully executed, actors are amazing, story is great, scenery and cinematography is beautiful, music is excellent, no short cuts were taken, everything was at its best.Every character was well developed or had something interesting to add, no matter how small the roll. As someone else pointed out, despite the gravity of the subject matter, Waititi keeps it light, although does not make light of the situation. We are left to consider the seriousness or the weightiness of life and death and our childcare system but through a humanizing lens. One could say this is a light political satire that delivers whimsy with its messaging, but I think the focus is truly on belonging.Recommend this to everyone!"
" it's unfortunate that the Oscars do not honor these types of films
",-0.6836,0.9923,2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"What do I mean by ""these types of films""?Well, to be perfectly honest, I have no idea, but whatever I actually do mean by ""these types of films"" they are certainly being unfairly rejected by the Academy. This movie was so damn good I can hardly comprehend how it didn't even get the Golden Globe nominee for best COMEDY, while ""Florence Foster Jenkins""-a movie that I am sure is okay but not nearly as great as this-gets the honor, mainly because it happens to have Meryl Streep in it (of course, I have not seen that movie, but based on everything I know about it it cannot be nearly as special as this masterpiece).Anyway, this film is practically flawless. I will admit that a few jokes were a bit too clich√© and predictable, but for the most part all of the humor is great, unique, original, and hilariously dark. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie come from a funeral and suspected child molestation.Despite its sometimes sick sense of humor, the film also has genuine heart. The arc of the two main characters may be slightly predictable, but it is presented in such a way that it tugs at your heart strings while also making you laugh and cry. It's a hilarious movie with plenty of heart, warmth, and sadness. The characters are all memorable and well developed, the performances-especially Sam Neil-are all fantastic and usually hilarious, and the plot is absolute insanity. This movie is zany, adventurous, and laugh out loud funny-and I could not recommend it enough!"
" Not what I expected, but still a brilliant flick with a lot of heart
",0.7351,0.9952,2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I came to this movie from Taika Waititi's 2014 gem What We Do In The Shadows, which was friggin hilarious and totally my favorite comedy of the decade! Keeping that in mind, I was expecting a laugh-out-loud dark comedy, but what I got was a heartwarming coming of age story about a young boy and his journey of finding a loving family. There were a couple of jokes here and there, some dry humor and sarcasm, but never once did it get anything more than a slight giggle from me and both instances were at the hunter cabin, with the cauc-Asian thing (which was in the trailer) and the ""pervert innuendos"". In the end, the movie gave me heart fuzzies! Kinda reminded me of Mr Fantastic actually, which I think came out the same year! The correlation is more in the tone I think, a dramatic movie with wildly quirky characters, beautiful scenery, authentic family bonds/interaction, natural feeling comedy and a nice message of love! So if you were like me, here's a warning: watch this with the premise of seeing a cute indie flick about a chubby ""gangster"" who disobeys, steals, spits, runs away, throws rocks, kicks stuff, loiters and makes graffiti. Also swears a lot and loves haiku!"
" What We Do in the Bush
",0.0,0.8781,2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Lost in New Zealand's bush outback, circumstances cause the local authorities to incorrectly assume that an elderly farmer has kidnapped his foster child for deviant reasons in this blend of comedy and drama from 'What We Do in the Shadows' director Taika Waititi. The film pulls in somewhat expected directions with the old man and the boy gradually bonding despite neither really wanting much to do with the other in the first place, however, the movie is constantly elevated by the quality of the principal performances. Julian Dennison (in his first leading role) is charming as the boy in question and Sam Neill offers one of his most heartfelt turns as his adoptive father. The supporting performances are a little uneven with Rachel House over-the-top as an overbearing child protective services officer who takes her job far too seriously, though there is something to be said for how heartless she is around Dennison, even early on, describing him as little more than a 'problem child'. This ties in well with the film's themes of perception and misleading appearances as we soon discover that although sullen and moody, Dennison is a warm and energetic young man; indeed, the overall story is about two lonely souls who connect as they find themselves equally misunderstood by the world at large. Message aside though, 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' is a downright funny film. Some of the humour is a little on the cute side, but all of Neill and Dennison's interactions are great; same goes for the scattered movie references throughout."
" I processed that one for ages.
",0.0,0.9979,2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Taika Waititi tells us a lot about Ricky Baker in the opening of Hunt for the Wilderpeople without a peep from his mouth. A police car rolls through the hills to a choral musical backing. When he steps out from the vehicle, we get a glimpse of the Illuminati-inspired motto on the jacket back, and the soundtrack acknowledges it with an alien twang. Ricky is spoken for on behalf of welfare officer Paula, who immediately labels him a lost cause in a montage of his criminal activities (the lengthy rap sheet includes throwing rocks, kicking stuff, defacing stuff and lots of other heinous stuff). ""He's a real piece of work,"" she proclaims. Ricky inspects the place quickly, and then wordlessly returns to the police car. This, and other various markers throughout the film, say a lot about how he has been bounced around foster parents all his life. He doesn't even rate himself lasting the day here - might as well get onto the next 'home'. But this couple do want him. Well, half of them do. In a wonderfully affectionate performance lasting all of twenty minutes, Rima Te Wiata crafts a character of great warmth and wit who seems to be able to do it all; the only thing she's missing is a child to pass it along to. Aunt Bella, like most of Waititi's characters, is a hyper-caricature with a good heart; she's thoughtful enough to leave both a sharp knife to kill monsters in the night as well as a hottie to keep Ricky warm. She relays this through the door because she has an inkling of what a good mother's qualities are, having envisioned this her whole life, and tries to respect his boundaries. Yet she is so excited she peaks around the door anyway, if only to make sure that he hasn't vanished on the spot. In the morning she urges him to at least have breakfast before he runs away. She's at once honest and revealing, and under no illusions of what Ricky has gone through. Her birthday rendition of what has to be a self-written ode to ""good as gold"" Ricky on a little toy piano is as heartwarming as a big gulp of hot soup on a rainy day. Has Paula ever told Ricky he has value? Has anyone? But then a thunderclap of a curveball hits them, and the film descends into the well-treaded material promised in the trailer: the formidable team of cantankerous old Hec and the chubby, impressionable Ricky on an adventure for the ages. The story is doled out in chapters unveiled in white, curly text giving the impression of a storybook come to life. Each frame Ricky stumbles across in his oversized hoodies are filled to the brim with character and attitude; see how Waititi overlays several Rickys in the same shot to simulate the fact that he is lost, how he contemplates rationing then scarfs down the rest of his food, or how he manages to start a fire but is not cooking wild game, but trying to heat his hottie. Ricky is one of those twenty-first century children who communicate extensively through their knowledge of pop culture, and like the hazy, dreamlike visions of Michael Jackson in Waititi's Boy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople also freely indulges him. His introduction to the bloodshed of the bush is a thudding Psycho-inspired montage that zooms right up into his squished, horrified face. When he is first called upon to wield a gun to potentially save his uncle, action music pumps into our ears before the recoil unceremoniously drops him. If he was old enough he'd declare himself Clyde and old gruffy Hec Bonnie. What these also reveal is the self-soothing nature of Waititi's characters, and how Ricky has fashioned himself a defense mechanism; he can conjure music at will, and the fact that there's nothing around but sticks and leaves has never stopped him. Locals will fondly remember Julian from Waititi's anti drug-driving commercial in 2013, which itself took from his short film Two Cars, One Night. Both contemplate the uncanny ability of children being able to apply their own humour and logic to darker and more uncomfortable situations, revealing the flip side of parental negligence. Ricky doesn't even get to have that experience. His dialogue unconsciously reveals the pains of his upbringing, and how he recycles the positive mantras that have been beaten into him: ""Okay Debbie Downer, let's write a haiku."" Paula's escalation in her attempts to recapture him hint at the self-fulfilling prophecy that she anoints each foster kid. At first he's a real bad egg, but by the climax they're being cornered by tanks and SWAT squadrons as if they were international criminals. It's a stigma that grows exponentially. Her self-stylised motto 'no child left behind' initially seems heartwarming, but becomes more sinister with each iteration; she's not so much concerned with his wellbeing as she is with making sure there is another foster family lined up. Ricky never stood a chance. In Chapter Seven, titled 'A Normal Life', Ricky is allowed to settle into the home of Kahu (Look at how Waititi shoots their fateful meeting. She's approaching from the left, she's approaching from the right, she swishes her hair in slow motion, the lens flare blinds Ricky! He's in love. Hilarious.) They sit down and begin to tentatively open up about their past. And then the camera pans across, and reveals Kahu's dad to be silently listening on the couch beside them. The shot is brilliant because it sneaks up on us. It represents all the ideals of warmth and family that Ricky is so unaccustomed to, that someone could just sit and listen and understand. The feeling envelops him like a baby's swaddle, and for the first time in forever, he sleeps soundly. Ricky may not quite receive the same amount of affection from Hec, but their co-penned haikus are majestical."
" The best is 'The Hunt for the Wilderpeople'!
",0.6696,0.9984,2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Taika Waititi is one name you will soon remember for a very long time if you don't already know it. Waititi is writer/director here for 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', which is already in the top 5 BEST movies of the year, but Waititi is also an actor too. He starred in and directed the recent 'What We Do In The Shadows', as well as directed 'Eagle vs Shark' and even worked on 'Flight of the Conchords' amongst other films. He is currently directing the upcoming 'Thor: Ragnarok' film for Marvel, and it's easy to see why Marvel hired this guy by watching 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople'. Even if the premise here is similar to other films, Waititi makes the story and characters entirely refreshing and original.If you're a fan of Wes Anderson movies and Edgar Wright movies, then you're sure as hell to enjoy Waititi and his 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', which is funny, charming, action-packed, and very heart-warming. It could be difficult to have all of these qualities in a film, buy Waititi weaves these elements in flawlessly and even leaves you wanting to spend hundreds of more hours with these two main characters. The film centers on a young, portly teenager named Ricky (Julian Dennison), who has been in and out of foster homes since he was a baby. The child services agent drops him off at his aunt's house in the middle of the New Zealand jungle and tells her that Ricky is somewhat of a problem child. That doesn't phase her much, as Ricky settles in to his new home in the wilderness, complete with his basketball sneakers, name-brand hoodie and flashy baseball cap.His aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata), is a fantastic person who tells it like it is and is blunt- in-your-face. She even makes jokes at Ricky's size, but it's done in such a fashion that it really is a term of endearment. Her husband on the other hand, Hector (Sam Neill) is the opposite of Ricky. Hector is a real outdoorsman type who doesn't talk much and knows how to handle himself in the woods. After an accident, Hector and Ricky must learn to get along, but when the child protective services come back to get Ricky, the due head off into the wilderness, so that Ricky won't have to go back to foster homes or worse ‚Äì juvie.Hector teaches Ricky (who fancies himself a wannabe gangsta) how to live in the woods, which comes with great laughs, when Ricky's only goal in life is to find toilet paper. Eventually the police and even the military start looking for Hector and Ricky after months of living in the wilderness, but the two come to bond and realize they need each other to express their feelings and loneliness. There are great quips of comedy n the vein of Wes Anderson and Edgar Wright here, as Hector and Ricky come across some interesting people in the wilderness, but there is also some dramatic moments here too, where the two try to express their past sadness in the form of funny haikus.There is an action set piece here as well, which I'm sure scored Waititi the 'Thor 3' job, and after seeing this film, he is more than capable of making the best 'Thor' film or even Marvel movie thus far. The performances by Sam Neill and Julian Dennison are phenomenal. They have such a good and hilarious chemistry and are very real people without ever getting too sappy or over-the-top, which we can thank Waititi's screenplay and direction for that. There are some excellent movie references and a ton of heart and soul into this film that make 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' one of the BEST films in a long long time.MUST-SEE!!"
" A kids' movie for adults, or an adults' movie for kids
",0.0,-0.2617,2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"""The Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a strange bird. It's part black comedy about two people who are tragically misunderstood by society, and part kids' wish fulfillment fantasy. It seems to shoot itself in the foot by being too ridiculous, too much a party to the fantasies of children to be taken seriously as an adult movie, and is too potty mouthed for many parents to find it suitable viewing for their kids.Ricky is an overweight Maori boy who is at the end of the line with child services. He has, apparently, been through many foster homes and orphanages, and his next stop will be young people's jail, if his latest posting doesn't work out.The menacing youth worker who delivers him to his new home reels off a litany of offenses he has supposedly committed, including vandalism and thievery. She speaks like she's incanting a protection spell against the boy. He doesn't say much, and dresses and walks like every young thug you've ever seen.He isn't, though, and you start to wonder what this youth worker's deal is. She compares herself to the terminator in a comparison that is too fitting. This is not an accurate depiction of people who work in social services, and you wonder why they went so far making her into an unfeeling, inhuman villain. Were they that desperate for a bad guy?The movie forgets, very very quickly, that Ricky was supposed to be a problem child. He's a dream: clever, polite, obedient, thoughtful. The only bad behaviour we see if his running away, which is not really an issue as his foster family live in the bush; he can't get far.Anyway, Ricky and his adopted ""uncle"", Hector, played by Sam Neill, end up on the run when Ricky attempts to live in the bush, and Hector comes to find him. It is assumed Hector has kidnapped the boy. The movie from then on out is sporadically entertaining, and mostly fits into a familiar kids' movie template about the tough guy with the heart of gold and the streetwise, misfit kid learning to trust each other.The movie approaches making its likable lead, the small, round, Ricky, a believable character, but with details like a late-movie car chase ‚Äì in which he shows driving skills Mario Andretti probably couldn't rival ‚Äì you are reminded of the movie's split personality."

",0.8979,0.9972,2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016): There is a strange victorious feeling when I watch a infamous indie film which marks a great impression than a heavy budget Hollywood Productions.Hunt for the Wilderpeople is such a great watch that it is easily one of the most entertaining movies of 2016.So how is it possible?Plot: Ricky (Julian Dennison) is a troubled orphan, raised on hip-hop and rejection. Placed with the latest in a series of foster families, this time on a farm far away from the city where he styles himself a gangster, Ricky is reluctant. But his foster aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata) breaks down his defences with down-to-earth love and affectionate mockery. However, when a tragedy threatens to steal back the life that Ricky has come to love, the boy finds himself on the run in the bush with Bella's grizzled husband Hec (Sam Neill) and a dog called Tupac. Gradually, the two rejected loners who only had Bella in common find a kinship, united against the authorities that hunt them down.Plus Points:1)Performances: Sam Neil (Jurassic Park fame) is brilliant in the role of Uncle Hector.Julian Dennison is fantastic and the major pro of this movie.His chemistry with Sam Neil is the highlight of the movie.Neill's and Dennison's characters are so, so charming on-screen and are fully apt at weaving through the dramatic, comedic, and sad points of the script.2)Music: Music by Lukasz Buda,Samuel Scott and Conrad Wedde is not at all the type we heard before.They tried something new and it definitely gave a new feel to the movie.3)Cinematography: Cinematography Lachlan Milne is eye popping.The woods and the aerial shots of the village are brilliantly shot.4)Comedy: As I have said earlier,Sam Neill and Dennison characters are so hilarious that this movie never makes us feel bored.They thoroughly keep us entertained with their funny antics and dialogues.Waititi is ably supported by a uniformly hilarious and committed cast.So,Hunt for the Wilderpeople is entertaining at its best with brilliant performances and music.My rating 7.5/10"
" Really funny
",0.4927,0.9786,2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This film was a pleasant surprise and was full of unexpected twists and some hilarious quirky humour. My favourite character was the woman who adopted Ricky Baker at the start of the film. Her Happy Birthday Ricky Baker song was the highlight of the film for me. The kid playing Ricky Baker is excellent too and delivers his lines with perfect comic timing. The female parole officer who thinks she's the Terminator and he's Sarah Connor is hilarious too. The only parts of the film I didn't like were the sad parts, which either didn't make me feel as sad as I was supposed to, or just felt a little mean spirited. Overall this is a very funny, unique and original film."
" Charming, funny and heart warming film from New Zealand
",0.8074,0.9947,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,Riccy is a problem child ‚Äì having been given up by his birth mother he has ping ponged from care to foster homes all his short life. Then he is accepted by a larger than life woman in the shape of Bella. She is wed to curmudgeonly old Hec ‚Äì (Sam Neil) who is less than impressed with the new arrival.Life has a way of throwing the unexpected at us and so it does here resulting in Hec and Riccy sort of going into the Bush but being pursued by an over zealous child care officer and what looks like half the police in new Zealand ‚Äì what unfolds is a funny and moving story that will hopefully warm the cockles of your heart.I really enjoyed this ‚Äì it is one of those films where you can just sit back and enjoy. Everyone is great and little Julian Denison as Riccy was superb. This sort of works for the whole family too so pretty much gets to tick all the boxes ‚Äì completely recommended.
" That Score is just a marvel.
",0.4215,0.9546,2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"7/10. When a boy and his foster Uncle, (Sam Neill) go missing, there is a nation wide manhunt to track them through the New Zealand Bush. This is a real wacky movie, that at times is so weird, and at others times has heart. Young Julian Dennison is hilarious, and does such a fantastic job for a child actor, his accent and his attitude just cracked me up. He is also paired well with Sam Neill. Two completely different kind of people come together to form a bond, that plays well on film. And the score for this movie is so out there, it is so weird and quirky, and yet somehow marvellous at the same time. It's worth watching just to listen to the score, it's a little Tarantino esque. This is a real stand out for Director Taika Waititi, I think he has done New Zealand proud. I found the movie enjoyable, quirky and quite funny at times. Though maybe not for everyone, I would recommend seeing it. Hunt for the Wilderpeople #huntforthewilderpeople"
