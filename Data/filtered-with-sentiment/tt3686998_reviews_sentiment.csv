" Worth Watching. Great work. Thank you.
",0.8176,-0.09,2021-04-10 00:00:00,10,I have studied men's problems on my individual level. There are still many problems left behind but still it's the first and worth watching.
" Equality
",0.0,-0.835,2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,"I am a little bit surprised. I didn't think the movie would have such a high rating. As you can see, not because I disagree, but because I thought that it may appear too controversial. And believe me I had a few moments where I wasn't sure myself. Men need protection? Men need a voice? It sounded wrong to say the least.But the movie leaves certain things up to you, giving you more than one side of a story. Statistics is one thing, but hearing people talk about experiences is another. And yes my inner cynic sometimes still kicked in. Which I reckon was proving a point that was being made throughout.A very big Kudos to the woman who is behind this, for even entertaining the idea of talking to someone who was labelled a certain way and evidence seemed to prove that point too. But even though he sort of is cancelled in many peoples eyes, there is more to him, than some might want to make you believe there is.Nowadays to actually take the time and listen to someone we seem to disagree fundamentally ... it seems far stretched unfortunately. And the documentary may open your eyes too - especially the segment on ""bring back our girls"" is horrendous and horrific.It also is quite disheartening that people who more or less are working for the same or a similar cause, seem not to be able to work together. Nowadays we get triggered way too quick and way too often, seemingly fighting for a good cause but hurting and harming others who also have good intentions ... A quite straining movie to watch, but a very important one to say the least!"

You just can't deny it. It's not about being anti women or anti anything, it's about presenting a story from the victims of an indiscriminate and violent attack on a community or race (in this case all white men). People should express their beliefs in a way that doesn't directly contradict with what they're actually trying to achieve as that doesn't over any support outside of the coterie"

We don't always have to say ""Yeah but woman"" everytime we want to talk about this stuff.I havent seen it before today but i heard a lot of backlash about this wondering why people were so mad.

",-0.4019,0.0,2020-09-12 00:00:00,10,"Someday has to speak for men, and this documentary does this finally."
" Not the truth.
",-0.2411,-0.9976,2020-09-02 00:00:00,1,"It's true that breast cancer gets more attention and funding than prostate cancer. This, however, does not mean men are being discriminated against or are somehow marginalized. The same could be said about stomach cancer or brain cancer. For starters, breast cancer is not for women, while prostate cancer is for men. BOTH men AND women get breast cancer. It's not a female only cancer. BOTH men AND women stand to benefit from breast cancer research and a cure. Only men get prostate cancer. Women do not have prostates.Secondly, have men tried to organize fundraising events for prostate cancer? Have men established national non profit organizations designed to fund research and help fight or cure prostate cancer? Have men applied for government funding for prostate cancer organizations? Did people refuse to show up to their prostate cancer fundraising events? Did the government reject their applications for prostate cancer research funding?ORDid men not even try to organize nationwide fundraisers and build a non profit prostate cancer organization, from the ground up? They just decided they're these victims of the world favoring ""women's cancer"", because fundraising and government funding didn't effortlessly fall into their laps, without them having to work or fight for it. Women organized and fought tooth and nail for what they have now. These men simply are blinded by their sense of entitlement. ""If we aren't automatically handed what these women spent decades fighting for and building, we are victims and are being discriminated against"". What a joke.This is just one of many extremely one sided, half ""truths"" in this documentary."

",0.5684,0.9157,2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,This film documentary really opened up my eyes to what is wrong with our society & how men & boys health & rights are toss aside like we're sub human trash I highly recommend see or purchasing this film it's a TRUE REDPILLER!!! I LOVE THIS DOCUMENTARY SOO MUCH!!
" Incredibly nutritive but hard to swallow
",-0.249,0.9438,2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,"This documentary is mind blowing. It shows us that the bias that we have that men don't need help, and that they have all the advantages is wrong. It helps us to open our eyes on the other side of the subject. Of course, it is far from being easy to accept. Because it proves us that our opinion is not 100% correct. It proves us that those MRAs are not bad guys, as we could think in the first place. But when you accept that your opinion is not correct, then this documentary is a blessing. Of course, issues about women rights still have to be considered, and there are still so many things we need to fight on for women's rights. We just need to renember that men also have issues, and we should not forget them on the road. There is room to help everyone, we shouldn't let one group behind.Feminsm and MRA would merge into one Gender equity group in the perfect world. At least that is my opinion after watching this documentary.Tanks for this one, I recommend it to every open minded person."
" Dangerous! Couldn't finish to watch
",-0.5255,0.4199,2020-05-11 00:00:00,1,"I created a Imdb account only to review this documentary, this will make you understand how bad it really is!
I've read lot of 10 star reviews saying that the filmmaeker did an incredible job even being a big feminist, well, I've a bad news for you all... she wasn't a feminist even a bit.
I felt that she gave a big platform to the male movement and never for one second decided to stop and question them, the only thing she did was letting them speak, and that's it.
Also she probably didn't aknowledge the big data gap that exist about women, and why this is the reason many of the data she was giving was completely out of point and I find it unacceptable for someone who's filming about such a delicate topic.
I couldn't keep watching after Paul Elam (founder of A Voice For Man) said:""(speaking about the prevalence of males in politics and roles of power) That's why Imagine what it takes to be a successful politician,imagine how much of your personall life you have to give up, how much you work, how much privacy that you sacrifices, how much freedom in your day to day life that goes out the window. THERE ARE MORE MEN WILLING TO DO THOSE THINGS THAN WOMEN""."
" Horrible biased
",-0.6808,0.6096,2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the most biased films I've ever seen. In this film the MRAs are highly well reached and informed, they show writers such as Warren Farrell who has written 10 books on the issue, while the feminists are people like big red who are just internet meme.It would be like me making a documentary on socialism and getting noam Chomsky to represent socialism while I get any Torie voter I find on the street to resent capitalism.The film looks at male issues and only ever lets conservatives give they're take on the issue. never do they show progrives give they're opinion"
" A Poorly Developed Idea
",0.0,-0.6908,2020-04-07 00:00:00,1,"I started watching this documentary wanting to know more about MRAs, that is Men Rights Activists. Although I can say I have a few more info about the issues men claim are affected by, the documentary was a pain to watch.From the filmmaker who defines herself a feminist for really shallow reasons, with no intersectionality and loads of white privilege, to the extremely amateurish shots and development, this documentary does not hit the target. Data and events are not contextualised, every word is taken out of it's context, as if we were just listening to everyone's own ""truth"". When making a documentary, there is no relative truth. There are facts and interpretations of them. Whereas we can discuss the latter, there is no discuss over the former."
" Amazing introspective from a surprising source!
",0.7345,0.9312,2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,I was very impressed and moved with how Cassie handled herself throughout the documentary. Especially with her video diary moments. I would like to commend her for her courage & hope she continues to make videos in the future. It was very informative to a gender's needs that are very real and need not dismissed.
" Largely balanced and interesting, yet technically flawed documentary
",0.4019,0.9726,2020-03-16 00:00:00,7,"I am often drawn to documentaries on controversial subjects. I think a lot of people are, though some may be afraid to admit it. The outcomes for watching a documentary of this nature are often good, because there's a decent chance they'll either be eye-opening, surprisingly agreeable, or total train wrecks. Okay, maybe not everyone would want to come away from something thinking it a train wreck, but I'll always prefer fascinatingly bad to simply dull or boring.Thankfully, I can't in good conscience call The Red Pill a train wreck. It's somewhat eye opening, and definitely presents a compelling argument in a calm, non-aggressive manner. It's caused controversy because some are skeptical over whether Men's Rights Activists even deserve to be defended. There is a sense among some that all MRA members are misogynistic and bitter towards all women, and The Red Pill goes out of its way to say that this is not the case. If it were perfectly balanced, if might be more focused on how there are both decent and extremist members within the group (it certainly argues something along these lines for those who identify as feminist, as there extremist feminists and feminists are far from extreme), though it places far more of an emphasis on those decent, seemingly good-hearted MRA members.It's understandable, in all honesty. I can appreciate a well-constructed argument in a documentary like this one even if I'm not 100% convinced by it. It's given me something to think about, as well as introduced the idea that the issue of the MRA and its problematic aspects is perhaps more complex than it seems, and that's enough. I can't take too many points off for things I don't entirely agree with (it's the same reason I can enjoy some conspiracy theory documentaries without being entirely persuaded to side with their point of view). It's a little uncomfortable when the film largely ignores cases in which women are definitely effected more than men, but again, it wants to argue that men are victims in some areas more than is widely discussed. It doesn't outright dismiss the cases where women are genuinely disadvantaged, as a silver lining (though that might not be enough for all).It's an interesting film overall, and sustains interest for most of its almost two hours. It stuck in my mind for a while afterwards, and that's commendable. I can criticise it in some areas, however. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if director/interviewer/narrator Cassie Jaye had been a little more critical or thorough with her interviews, confronting her interviewees just a tad more, rather than grappling with complexities for the most part through narration and video diaries. Seeing a dialogue about these sorts of incredibly complex and multifaceted issues might have been both more compelling and overall fairer.The biggest problem with The Red Pill, however, is its technical merits. It's not shot particularly well, looking more like a series of Youtube videos or news interviews, maybe even worse in terms of production value. It just doesn't feel particularly cinematic. Something's off in this regard, as the lighting is often flat, location interviews sometimes uninteresting, colours are bland, and the sound quality is certainly less than stellar at times. It just doesn't feel or look like a standard feature length documentary. It didn't bother me at first, but once I noticed how technically disappointing it was, it was something I couldn't really shake for the rest of the film's duration.Still, despite all that, and despite some skepticism in terms of dodging certain statistics, this is still an interesting and brave documentary. You might not agree with much though, and maybe similarly it's not so ideal for you to agree with everything. The truth is probably somewhere in-between the extremes, and maybe that's what the documentary inevitably wants us to think. Whether the MRA deserves to have a little more respect and less criticism is something that views will differ on, but this documentary does a good job at explaining the good they can potentially do, while also shedding light on some genuinely important issues concerning men that may deserve more attention than they get. It's hard to say what any given viewer will think of this. Some will hate every second, some will love every second, some will find it offensive, some will be moved, some might respect what it has to say, and some may respect certain parts of it begrudgingly. Some may not even notice the technical limitations, while some may be unable to overlook them the way I mostly could, and have the movie be nearly unwatchable as a result.It's a tricky topic and a tricky documentary. But it exists, it's interesting, and it argues something that's fresh and thought provoking without (in my opinion) going too far towards criticising or demonising any other point of view. It does all this despite its fairly lacking technical aspects, and it's probably worth a watch, but I cannot guarantee exactly what you'll think or feel coming away from it once it's over. Consider it a riskily recommended documentary, then."
" Too Real

",0.0,-0.9371,2019-11-23 00:00:00,10,It came down to seeing how blindly angry and hateful the feminists were in this piece compared to the MRW that show civility....it's that simple really. The fringe feminists protesting speeches made me cringe...it shows what completely irrational people they really are. People that refuse to listen to an opposing opinion have no place in public debate.
" I think this is an important watch, but it is decidedly biased
",-0.3998,-0.9955,2019-11-22 00:00:00,8,"I think it is very good at clearly demonstrating men's problems and how mainstream society denies them. And highlighting problems with mainstream society as it is dominated by postmodernism, intersectionality and a more and more rampant totalitarian left wing (think the silencing often with loud protests and vile abuse of those who just want to talk and exchange ideas. In our today's society, liberals think their own morality gives them the right to abuse those that fall foul of it - that is as disgusting as it is dangerous).What it completely fails to do is acknowledge the infestation of MRA by, in many cases violent, misogynists. There is this complete shock effect at the beginning with the Steubenville case and Indian bus case. Once she gets into the meat of it and the documentary really starts looking and she interviews MRAs, suddenly she only concentrates on specific subsets of MRA. All this violence and hate is suddenly massively forgotten.MRA is overrun by violence and hate, going into those spheres online even I as a guy feel scared. shocked, so to have a documentary which essentially ignores this, is not acceptable.That is why I only give it a 8."
" Worth a watch no matter which side of the ""debate"" you are on
",-0.0516,0.9272,2019-10-31 00:00:00,6,"In a pretty good example of The Streisand Effect, I had never heard of the documentary The Red Pill until it made the news here in Australia when it was protested, banned, and cancelled. I happened to notice it on Amazon Video recently, and one rainy Saturday afternoon loaded it up.So what's it about?""When a feminist filmmaker sets out to document the mysterious and polarizing world of the Men's Rights Movement, she begins to question her own beliefs. Chronicling Cassie Jaye's journey exploring an alternate perspective on gender equality, power and privilege.""In this day and age these subjects are a giant rabbit hole of entrenched camps, so I'm just going to focus on the documentary itself, and not the rights and wrongs of the various groups involved.Jaye features prominently in this and you can see her struggle throughout. Sometimes when documentarians insert themselves into a story it feels like they take over and become almost too present. But I think she found a good balance between letting her subjects talk and talking herself.She talks to both men's rights activists and feminists so you do get to hear from both sides. I think she presents her story in a way that is easy to follow, and in such a way that it develops logically.Where it lets itself down is with some of the production work. The camera is often shaky, the colouring looks weird, and in one case as someone was interviewed in a bar the background noise was so loud that they had to put subtitles on the screen as you couldn't make out what was being said.Overall I found it to be a very interesting documentary. You can see Jaye's struggle, you can see her realisation that both sides have good points and that what she had believed up until starting this journey had only been part of the story.Jaye must have known that it would be controversial, and I respect that she had guts to put it out. Lots has been written and said about this documentary and no matter where you fall on the spectrum of thought on this subject matter, I think its worth having a look at."

I rated it as a 10 because it needs to be seen, and also in recognition of Cassie Jaye's courage in doing the film, and dealing with the vilification she has received since its debut. It was banned from being shown in many locales, and she was personally attacked by many in the mainstream media for even doing such a production. If anything, that response only magnifies what the film had to say about the inability of men getting their message listened to in today's cultural climate.

" Very interesting
",0.4576,-0.99,2019-04-13 00:00:00,8,"I knew nothing about MRAs going in to this, but I'm not blue pilled either. What struck me about this film is that both sides in this argument have supposedly very similar goals yet one side really is not listening to the other.Images of male feminists banging saucepans to drown out speakers who they imagine they disagree with is reminiscent of white anti racists calling Candace Owens the N word. Who knows, it's likely the same mob.There's lots of interesting stuff here but I think what sticks with me the most is how one of the feminist activists interviewed actually did see that MRAs agreed with her about most things, whilst refusing to listen to them. Contrasting that with the thoughtful and humane approach of the BLM activist in Hoaxed, which I watched the night before.This is a very good film and highly recommended. It's a very depressing subject though. There's a conspiracy to destroy western civilisation and propagate a revolution to authoritarian rule. That's what motivates the drones of the revolution to drown out opposing voices in case they accidentally hear something that might alter their foregone conclusion.Unfortunately watching this will probably do as much good as watching the Kardashians. The war is already lost."
" A fascinating film
",0.5423,0.8705,2019-01-14 00:00:00,10,"After reading that ""The Red Pill"" had been banned at some venues, and seeing it described as misogyistic an apology for hate, I was ready for a nasty diatribe against women. What I saw was quiet and even gentle, bearing no resemblance to the negative portrayal.If you want to get somebody to dig in their heels and not change, yell at them. But if you truly want change, whisper, and if you have something worth hearing, people may listen. This film whispers.For decades society has been telling me that I have been enjoying all the unearned advantages of being born male, and I have internalized a lot of that narrative without question.It may be time for some rethinking. After watching ""The Red Pill"" I have more questions than answers."
" An Honest Review
",0.5106,0.9716,2018-12-24 00:00:00,10,"It seems like most of the 1 star reviews, from reading through this, didn't actually watch the film.It doesn't seem to me that the 1 star reviews actually took the time to watch the documentary. Most of what they claim aren't present in the film at all, they are assumptions of what the MRA is and not what is stated in the documentary.And then there are entire reviews about thing that aren't even a part of the documentary.So clearly this is polarizing, but I haven't seen polarization where it's this blatant that one side didn't bother to watch the film.At any rate, the Cassie video journals are interesting as we see how her own thoughts evolved on the subject (if they are real) and the interviews are nice, especially with how they openly contradict one another. They give you the feeling that one side of the debate just isn't listening to the other.But ultimately, it is a fail stylistically. You have documentaries like ""The Corporation,"" ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,"" that all do a decent job of presenting their sides with a bit more style.Even some of the interview locations where show with semi-distracting backgrounds.The substance is there. And the even-handedness seems to be there as well, thought she does make conclusions (which is fair to do) she also does it with enough integrity to show the other side of the debate and even cover the history.The problem is one of style, but that's like a club tie and a firm handshake, its something that can be picked up over time."

Its a basic and fool question, apparentely, but in fact, modern feminism does not seems to aimming it. You are free to thing woman deserve more protection than men. Ok. But you should not pretend to be a humanist, because facts show that men are mistreated even worse. Men die on wars, carry our garbage, suffer from worst jobs on planet.

" A PARTIAL GLIMPSE INTO REAL AFFAIRS
",0.0,-0.9549,2018-12-20 00:00:00,8,"Most the reviews I've read say ""Amazing eye opening honest wow"" or ""Anti Feminist MRA propaganda from whiny bigot men""
Both of those types of reviews are representative of the same problem covered in the film. The Red Pill induced an emotional response, either good or bad, and made these viewers biased irrational critics. I only want to point this out because there is a real problem that Ms. Jaye does attempt to understand and partially does so. Most of that problem is the way we treat eachother. Empathy, consideration, accountability, and self righteousness have dwindled and are nearly non existent on the Internet.
I don't know the honest intentions or motivations of the filmmaker. There is a lot of information in the film. One thing I won't do, is dismiss the information without fact checking it personally, then write a review claiming it's all bogus and present no viable information of my own. Again, the film could have some imbalance, but crucially it's important to understand the real problem the film is exposing, the truth that a lot of people have no idea how to act within a developed society.
My personal opinion is very simple. Modern society is slipping backwards. There is endless literature out there about dissatisfaction, depression, obesity, and distraction becoming overwhelmingly prominent in today's world. Proof of this is easy to find yourself. Most internet sites/ apps with a comment section, such as YouTube, represent this.
Unfortunately a large percent of people within our society are unable to separate their emotions/ feelings from their behavior. They feel therefore they act. A deeper understanding of the different responsibilities for behavior need to occur. I know I'm not responsible for whatever I may be feeling at any given time, but what I AM responsible for is how I ACT on those feelings, my BEHAVIOR. I believe that's one of the big issues shown in the documentary, as well as the critics and reviews of ""The Red Pill"".
The fact is the footage was taken. It's all real. Bias or not, video with audio does not lie. The snowflake analogy adding up to the snow bank in the film is perfect for the depth of the problem. Feminists, MRA's, protesters, and political underlinings make this an extremely larger problem than any film can cover. Ms Jaye did an excellent job covering the part she set out to cover.
I'll take my lesson from the film."
" Highlights Challenging Issues That Leaves You Wanting to Explore Them More
",0.1531,0.9918,2018-12-19 00:00:00,8,"Let me just start off by saying that I cannot understand for one minute the back lash this film / documentary has had from parts of society. To hear it described as ""controversial"" and that it' has made people ""angry"" and is in any way ""offensive"" seems bizarre to me. I certainly do not share that view and I imagine anyone who had seen the film would not either.I think the fact that the mainstream media has reported it as such kind of justifies why this film needed to be made and only further reinforces many of the issues that are explored in the film.I really enjoyed the film and felt it gave a fair platform to both the feminist and the lesser known men's rights movement.I think it was great that it was made by a self-proclaimed Feminist such as Cassie Jaye and one of the best parts of the film is her personal diary which she keeps throughout. It's fascinating to see how her opinions begin to change and the questions she asks of her own beliefs along her journey. Something that I feel many of the audience members will be going through with her.Despite me already being familiar with some of the statistics put forward by the MRA's in the film, I feel it still touched upon some of the less documented issues relating to men, such as the notion that males are generally seen as disposable in many societies. It also gives greater insight into many of the 'well known' disadvantages men have in society. I use the term 'well known' as someone who has done research into this issue prior to watching the film. Whether they can truly be described as such when referring to the wider society is debatable.I felt there were some particularly interesting characters that were interviewed during the film. In particular, the likes of Warren Farrell and Erin Pizzey who both have appear to have been supporters of women's issues but have faced a backlash for not towing the common feminist narrative and daring to go slightly outside the box with their views on equality. Something that I'm sure Cassie Jaye can now relate to.I think that was the most eye opening things for me after watching the film. I knew many of these issues existed for men, however I wasn't so aware of the opposition towards raising such issues in society.There was a level of irony throughout the whole film that several of the feminists interviewed actually touched upon; in that there are some common goals between feminism and MRA's. This left me confused as to why there was such a division between the 2 sides.This is where if I was to be critical of the film, I might say that quite often I sat there wishing Cassie would put some of the ideas under a layer of scrutiny to go a level deeper than the film typically goes. This applies to people interviewed on both sides.It may have been nice to see more interaction between the MRA's and the Feminists to see if there could be some compromises reached. There is a degree of this in the film, however it's largely shut down by the feminist side. It would have been interesting to see more structured dialogue between the 2 sides. However, I do concede that the film is already close to 2 hours long and you can only fit in so much material.It's an interesting watch and even after 2 hours I was still enjoying the film and didn't want it to end. I felt it left me with as many questions as answers, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for such a film that challenges the views of society in the way that the Red Pill does."

I will therefore confine myself to saying that this is not a comfortable film to watch, regardless on where we stand politically. It is perhaps exactly that quality of causing us discomfort by challenging long-held belief-systems that makes watching The Red Pill one of the most worthwhile ways of spending a couple of hours. (It even explains to what the ""red pill"" refers).Cassie Jaye is also to be congratulated on making the raw interviews available on YouTube, showing us what was said before the 100 hours of material were edited down into 2 (just search for ""The Red Pill Raw Files"").

" Honestly, Everyone Should Watch This
",0.4588,-0.9996,2018-10-12 00:00:00,10,"This film is important for everyone, but especially for open-minded moderates (people not already full-fledged feminists or MRA's). Because anti-MRA's or close-minded feminists will probably just ignore all the information anyway, and MRA's will probably not learn much new. However I would still recommend it for new MRA's, and also experienced MRA's who want to see an overall basic summary of males' issues to keep in mind for the next time someone inevitably challenges the need of a Men's Rights MovementThe film addresses, along with provides evidence and statistics for, a lot issues that disproportionately affect males, like: - the family court's bias against fathers. How custody battles and judges too often favor biological mothers, even abusive and unfit ones - paternity fraud. E.g. how in French it's illegal to get a paternity test without the biological mother's consent - the high rate of male homelessness - the high rate of male suicide - the state of boys in the education system - workplace fatalities, which are nearly all men - the prison sentence disparity for the same crimes, which is much higher between the sexes than between any ethnicities - reproductive rights. A man can be denied fatherhood and be forced to let his child die; or he can be forced to provide for an unwanted child (including males who are raped, tricked into it, spermjacked, under-aged, or not even the biological father). Whether or not he wants to be a father, the choice is entirely the woman's and he's just forced to pay the consequences - selective service and male disposability - early death - traditional sex roles, which do indeed disadvantage males as much as females. Men being demanded to slave away to make money for the family, take often dangerous jobs, risk and sometimes give their lives to protect women is not a privilege. In the past, both sexes were expected to conform to these restrictive roles. Now women are mostly free of them, but men are still often shamed when they don't conform - one-sided domestic violence and sexual violence discourse and often laws. Police officers' tendency to arrest the man in a situation of domestic violence, even when he's the victim. No shelters for abused men. Physically and sexually abusive women not being taken seriously by professionals - Boko Haram's misandry (how they would specifically spare the girls and murder the boys), as well as the gynocentric coverage of their crimes. E.g. the attention ""Bring Back Our Girls"" received, despite Boko Haram having murdered thousands of men and boys beforehand and that getting relatively no attention - forced genital cutting against boys being legal pretty much everywhereI'm glad there were feminists in the video, as well. Many of them exposed themselves as either liars or ignorant. One said ""domestic violence is a cover word for men abusing women, because women don't abuse men. We only need more shelters for women and girls"". Right before a CDC report that showed there were 5,452,000 men who were physically abused by their partners (and don't say it was by other men, because certainly only a small fraction of those men were gay) compared with 4,774,000 womenA couple feminists said things like ""MRA's just whine online"", ""they don't actually care about male victims"", ""they don't do anything concrete"". Just as these same feminists were protesting against and shutting down men's conferences. It's like ""how are you going to complain about MRA's not doing anything concrete and real-world when you do everything in your power to attack them and fight against their real-world efforts as soon as they do?"" Same with how feminists attacked Erin Pizzey for trying to get a shelter for abused men, how women's groups attacked rape laws in India being made gender neutralThere are still a lot of people who believe that modern Western culture is a patriarchy, who believe in male privilege, who believe the ""women are powerless victims; men are privileged oppressors"" narrative, who believe MRA's don't have any real cause to fight for and that they're just misogynists who want to take away women's power. This film exposes all those lies for exactly what they are"
" Highly recommended on many levels
",0.2716,-0.9952,2018-10-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a true gem in today's dysfunctional politicised world which has stopped talking about issues, constantly fights dirty below the belt without a modicum of concern for solving societal issues. The topic in itself (issues of men's rights and the official society's non-compassionate disinterest in them) is interesting enough and a thoughtful addition to the women's rights topic. The documentary's message is that each gender has its own rights issues, of a very different nature just like the genders are very different. But what is really gobsmacking is the additional insight how intolerant today's mainstream ""feminist"" politics is - unnecessarily - to fellow people's problems. What harm if the issues of both genders in society are recognised and addressed openly? We see an extension of the intolerant left-right party wars.The movie documents how today's feminist movement leaders incite aggression, violence, hate and use outright lies against the men's rights movements while pretending falsely to be against such very violence and aggression. It shows these so-called feminists' (rather fanaticists') disgusting, and abusive narrow-mindedness, evil propaganda tactics and mass manipulation which does not stop before lies, to further ... to further ... what exactly?"

Having worked in men's health policy and research I have seen the shocking disparities in health risks behaviours and outcomes in particular, and witnessed how much resistance there to these even being discussed, let alone getting responses funded. However, it is also important not to downplay critical issues facing women through comparisons - in domestic violence for example, women are far more likely to be seriously injured, killed or fear for their lives then men. Also the prostate vs breast cancer comparison misses the fact that breast cancer affects women at a much younger age, with a hugely greater impact in terms of potential life years lost."

I'm so glad that she brings up the fact that a lot of men struggle with physical abuse from their girlfriends. I have dear male friends who's ex-girlfriends used to beat them up on a regular basis. Yet nothing was ever reported.
I also like the fact that she interviews MRAs, feminists, anti-feminists, etc. She does a good job explaining sides from all angles. 
It's pretty evident in the movie that MRAs care about women's rights, they just think it's important to focus on men's rights as well. And I agree.
As a woman who lives in the west, I honestly wonder why some feminists complain that we have no rights or that men are ruining everything, patriarchy, mansplaining, toxic masculinity, etc. None of this is helping anything in any way & I feel like women (for the most part) have it pretty easy here."

The documentary presents sufficient supporting raw data for its main arguments, such as higher suicide rates among men, child custody bias in courts, the social norm of valuing lives of women more than that of men and its repercussions ... presents some interesting points for thought such as objectification of men as success objects by women. All are VALID points to which the feminist advocates in the movie couldn't find a VALID explanation, and did little other than mumbling when asked about. A lot of respect to the film maker, a self identified feminist, who found in her the compassion, and the courage to engage in critical thinking, to hear, and tell the stories of those whose voices are being silenced with shaming, name calling, and false assumptions. I don't care about the MRA or whatever they are called, and even if they are bad, some of their members made some VALID points regarding REAL issues, that are not specific to MRA, but that many men can identify with nowadays. It must be addressed, not disregarded !!Now for you geniuses who want to discard my review with making some false assumptions about me, an independent person who you have never met and who is not affiliated to any organization, go ahead; it is very convenient to do it that way, but it won't make the issues and the truth go away ;)Have a nice day, ya'll !"

",0.4588,-0.5071,2018-07-12 00:00:00,5,"Common sense refutes many of the claims the MRAs make throughout the film. Almost everyone of these claims is backed by little more than anecdotal evidence that the filmmaker never questions. What statistics are used are never given context. It is genuinely hilarious how frequently the MRAs accidentally use common feminist sayings without realizing the irony. Some valid points are brought up by the MRAs, but most issues they bring up are also areas of concern of feminist movements. Another LARGE thing to consider is that this is a very white perspective. No people of color interviewed--and that is not for lack of experts. Sympathy for MRAs can only go so far. To a point it is just pathetic, and this film crosses that point."
" A self identifying feminist realizes she's not actually a feminist
",0.0,-0.9983,2018-07-03 00:00:00,1,"I wanted to cry at the end of this, not because I felt like I had learned anything new, but because it reinforced what I already knew - that sexism is on the rise, especially in young women. The only people that come away from this and feel like their opinion is changed, are people that were influenced by sexist beliefs in the first place. Personally, I had not identified as feminist until recently, but it turns out, I have always been for gender equality. But, because of the labeling of older feminists as ""radical feminists"", I had felt that that was an insult, and did not want to be considered disagreeable. Younger people now do not understand that ""radical feminist"" is not a new insult. That was what killed the movement in the 1980s when the ERA failed to pass, which is now only having a new wave due to current politics. Men's rights are not a backlash to feminism - they are hijacking it. It is an inside job. The last argument focuses on circumcision, but what the narrator doesn't seem to understand is that it was the same people in the 1970s that fought for sexual and racial equality, that also fought against things like circumcision. And the women's movement has never claimed that there aren't victims and perpetrators on both sides - that is the opposite of what it claims, since it posits that men and women are equal (and therefore equally capable of being good and bad). While thought provoking, I find that this documentary impassions where feminists already had compassion. The fact that the filmmaker didn't know about these issues is what really terrifies me.Women WANT to dig ditches, we WANT to fight and die in wars. We don't want to be the first person off the boat. And we certainly don't want to coddle men's emotions, just as we don't want women to be coddled. But, you will find that while some men are saying that women have it better than men, they are predominately the same people fighting to keep things the way they are (while not necessarily the men in this film). I think what we see here is an example of men taking their own individual experiences, in which they were negatively effected by a woman or sexism in general, and they are incorrectly extrapolating it to mean that feminism overall is bad.The fact that it does not address benevolent sexism is also troubling (when men treat women as if they are in need of protection). In other words, it focuses on the plight of men suffering for the sacrifice of protecting women, but it fails to expand on why that mentality is bad for women, too (it weakens their social power outside of the context of war and labor, which justifies inequality). Men who demonstrate benevolent sexism are also more likely to demonstrate hostile sexism - the type that we are familiar with, because the two things are related. Those of us who truly understand what sexism is, have always known that the pedestal which women are placed on is in fact imaginary, and men choose to continue making sacrifices (like fighting in wars), because it reinforces their superiority as humans.Real feminists want the opportunity to die for a cause - they want to be able to say they earned their privilege. Because the driving force of human behavior is to do something good for others and to have value in society, even as a ditch digger. It is a privilege to say that you are the breadwinner, and that you did the work. Anti-feminists, like the woman in this film, fail to acknowledge that unfair privilege is harmful to men, by treating them as inferior in a way, needing an unfair advantage, and to be lied to about their true value. The fact that the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram was so publicized is also an example of benevolent sexism, where significant attention was given because of the underlying belief that women are more vulnerable and needing protection. THAT is sexism, not the fact that so many boys were killed, too, which is of course a grave tragedy, and no true feminist would ever say that it wasn't. So, instead of abandoning the idea of feminism as sexual equality for all, why not just acknowledge that you never truly understood it to begin with?"

(Warning - this MAY start a minor flame war.)Let me caveat this by stating I very much consider myself a feminist, and have personally experienced - as we all have - more than enough abusive/exploitive misogynist encounters. (Even one of those is ""enough"". #metoo.)And one can't deny there are some ""bad apples"" in the MRA movement: a sub-section who *do* (perhaps intentionally) overlook acutely legitimate women's rights concerns. Those that fall into that category use the cloak of MRA to hide inherently misogynistic views. Needless to say, folks like that should be immediately corrected and educated... no compromise allowed.Still: documentarian Cassie Jaye presents a balanced case here in Red Pill, exposing the strawmanning stereotyping on both sides of the Feminist/MRA fence - all nuance be damned. (A us-vs-them mindset similar in nature to the red-blue political dichotomy so unescapable now in the US. )But Men's issues are human issues, too. IMO, any true Feminist must be concerned with both. Which makes Red Pill an intelligent watch. Tribalism always aggravates social problems, it never helps. The only thing that *can* is a principled, fair and open minded look across the board.

" Are you ready to have your illusions shattered?
",-0.1531,-0.9658,2018-02-09 00:00:00,8,"I remember, years ago, before everybody started talking about ""mansplaining"" and ""male privilege"", I was at university studying social work, minoring in gender studies. I repeatedly came across the statement made by feminists - kind of an official codicil at the end of their magna cartas - that said they were okay with men starting groups of their own, to work on men's issues.Even in those dark days, I didn't believe it. What we have seen in recent years with the concomitant rise of ""MRAs"" (Men's Rights Activists) as feminism entered the mainstream, is that that line at the end of feminist treaties was a bald-faced lie. Men try to hold meetings to discuss their issues, women try to shut them down. Female protestors verbally and physically attack anyone who tries to enter talks by proponents of Men's Rights such as Janice Fiamengo and Karen Straughan. Their war-cries drown out the reasonable speeches made by the speakers. Illegally, they pull fire alarms, and make threats of violence to the owners of any venue who will allow MRAs to speak.This is all documented in ""The Red Pill"", a shocking, infuriating, at times heart-breaking documentary that was - surprise surprise - protested, shut down, and ultimately ignored by the media.At one point, Professor Fiamengo asks her protestors why they are so terrified of hearing an opinion different to their own. The answer seems to be that these people are allergic to facts. They avoid them like the plague. They attempt to stop them being spoken - to anyone - in the first place. And when they hear them, they go crazy. Footage of the charming feminist protestor ""Big Red"" doesn't do a whole lot to dissuade people from the notion that feminists are unhinged. This brings us to another bizarre fact about many feminists: they apparently cannot see how they support negative stereotypes about themselves through their own behaviour.Again, it's an imperviousness to facts, which are willingly ignored, dodged like Keanu Reeves dodges bullets in the movie that gave ""The Red Pill"" its name.Throughout, the MRAs seem like perfectly nice, reasonable people, whereas the feminists are flywheels who won't even begin to listen to any of the complaints they share.No wonder they tried - and perhaps succeeded - to bury it."

With cherry-picked data from the men and virtually NO data to counter it, Jaye pretends to wander, doe-eyed, through this mysterious issue of ""men's rights"" as if nobody had ever dare utter the phrase in public, much less in serious debate. Lacking historical perspective, lacking objective data, Jaye acts as if she's received an epiphany about men being mistreated and ignored by society, until the end, where she declares she can no longer call herself a feminist. Along the way, Jaye has completely mischaracterized feminism and given carte blanche to a bunch of well-off men who want to sit in their homes and complain about the pressures of being a man and how women just don't care. This could have been a really interesting piece and it actually could have brought men and women together under the umbrella of human rights, but instead Jaye takes the men's claims lying down, never challenging, never countering. As a film, I suppose it's appealing to disgruntled men. So there's that. As a documentary, it's useless."

And also when I heard about how many feminists protested the screening of the film, I decided to see for myself and now I understand the reason why feminists wanted this film banned.It's because they're so afraid of the truth that men suffer so much and how the double standards of the feminist movement poison everything. It is also shown how feminists hate it when a non-feminist try to speak up and try to silence them because they're so indoctrinated and so narcissistic that they act like the Spanish Inquisition and the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages.This documentary proves that men are seen as expendable, how they get screwed over in family courts, the fallacies of the so-called ""rape culture"", and statistics that show the sad truth and major differences between men and women.Of course, after this documentary, feminists would call Cassie Jaye a traitor and a sell-out, which is a typical reaction you'd expect from a feminist.

The production value was great and it was a topic which really doesn't get any mainstream media attention (unless you count htitpieces on buzzfeed, vox, or huffingtonpost). She focused on the issues that the MRA movement is most concerned with and which your average person can easily get on board with. She also exposed some of the flaws of the modern feminist movement, which is in desperate need of self-evaluation. She mostly avoided some of the most controversial points, which may actually have been wise because this film got a huge backlash as it is. There were some pretty compelling arguments made in the documentary and there were some very sad stories presented which I think will raise peoples awareness of men's issues. It would have been good to hear more about the accusations made against the MRAs however because they were sometimes quite severe.

" Take the Red Pill. Do it now.
",0.0,-0.9527,2017-11-19 00:00:00,10,"As its International Men's Day I thought I'd review a documentary that I saw a few days ago.How did I learn of The Red Pill? Thats a journey in itself...Someone tried to bully me in my place of work for being openly gay (note the word 'tried'. I fought back and have never seen myself as a victim. I'm a fighter). However, in the midst of what was happening to me I began to suffer from clinical depression. The panic attacks that I had kept at bay since the age of 13 were now out of control and I began to experience suicidal thoughts on a daily basis.It was whilst suffering from all of this that I began to research the issue of suicide and learnt that 75-78% of suicides are male. This fact shocked me massively. And so from looking into male suicide I learnt about The Red Pill. The title is actually a reference to the movie The Matrix ''in which the protagonist is offered the choice of a red pill, representing truth and self-knowledge, or a blue pill representing a return to blissful ignorance''.I knew that the film was seen as controversial to some people with some feminists wanting it to be banned. So is this film about the Men's Rights Movement a rancid cesspool of anti-feminism rhetoric, a film that only conveys views from rape enablers that are fundamentally anti-women? Of course not. The film is amazingly balanced with Men's Rights activists finally given a platform as well as feminists on the same topics. I had never heard these Men's Rights advocates speak before which is also very telling. The audience is granted a modicum of intelligence with which they can make up their own mind. Topics raised and discussed include male suicide, the lack of funding for male health conditions such as testicular and prostate cancer, the custody battles that fathers go through, the male victims of domestic abuse...the list goes on. These are all issues in which there is no equality between the sexes with men coming out disadvantaged. The documentary itself is amazingly made by filmmaker Cassie Jaye. She presents a well rounded and perceptive documentary that is balanced, fact-based and free from hysterical amateur dramatics. The documentary flows effortlessly and you feel like you want to see more when it finishes. Thankfully there are uncut and unedited interviews from the film on YouTube. And whilst you're on YouTube look up Cassie Jaye's videos. Especially of note are the interviews given to the Australian media who had never even seen the film (they claim that Ms Jaye hadn't supplied the film for them to see when in fact she had and several times. Ignorance is bliss, Andrew O'Keefe) but called it misogynistic and hateful. This is clear proof that they had never seen the film as The Red Pill is neither. But it seems that others are also taking The Red Pill. Taste of Cinema had a list of their favourite documentaries on their website recently. The Red Pill featured in that list. And it fully deserved to be there.I'll finish this review by reiterating the fact I quoted earlier. 75-78% of suicides are male. 75-78%! These conversations regarding men's issues need to be had before there are many more casualties. And I speak from very bitter experience. The Red Pill starts this process of discussion and discourse in a brilliantly balanced and intelligent way. Thank you, Cassie Jaye."

This movie exposes that. They seem to be full of arrogance and look like fools - cocky, loud, yelling, swearing and calling people names. It's extremely hard to watch. We need to look to rational people with open minds who will help merge women and men together on these issues. Anyone can see we can not continue like this. It has to be difficult for women who are proud to be feminist (but are NOT radical) to watch this movie. I believe that men's issues should be represented fairly. Stand up! Take notice!

" A documentary with very poor journalism
",-0.5256,-0.8414,2017-10-06 00:00:00,2,"First off I wanted to state that I am a male and I thought this film was a huge waste of time. It is a documentary about a bunch of whiny men with no real journalistic integrity.First I never got a sense of what male activists actually wanted to achieve; yes they stand up and shout that men are actually the ones being discriminated against while women have all the advantages. Unfortunately, these activists aren't doing anything about the actual issues - nothing was presented in the documentary.The movie notes the high level of abuse against husbands so why are these men not creating public service announcements, paying for posters and billboards. They could have a really great slogan - domestic violence doesn't see gender. The men lament the lack of services for them like there is only one men's shelter in the entire country. Most shelters are run by non-profit organizations. So instead of whiny why don't they get together, create a society and apply for government grants. The journalist didn't bother to answer these questions.Instead of being active all they do is sit in front of audiences saying how they are getting a raw deal in society. However, what women have found out is that society won't change until you change.The bit that really got me was the idea that men are scarifying themselves. A bunch of stats like work-place accidents, war combat deaths were presented in the film. However what is never mentioned is that women were never allowed in combat positions. For example: it wasn't until 2012 that women were allowed to serve in a submarine. Men are involved in more work place accidents because women were never hired in these jobs like firefighter, police officer, lumberjack, miner. A little bit of objectivity from Ms Jaye would have been nice.Yes there are some issues that needs to be addressed in society like a man's role in the family and the growing threat of domestic violence but that doesn't mean we should stop supporting women in their battle for equality."
" I hope Cassie Jaye makes more documentaries

While the issues it covers are interesting and thought provoking, I am in general just tired of the fanatical polarization on so many issues today. But this was not even a debate that was on my radar. I thought, let's just give it a watch and see what the fuss is about.Wow. So well done because it just got me thinking. I started doing searches on the web to double check and also just think about things.I mainly wanted to say - I hope that Jaye and other people would make more stuff like this. I am just so over every social issue being a full on battle with accusations of hate and belittling of the other side. Shutting down debates or speakers and throwing around ""hate speech"" labels like it's no big deal. Movies and media presenting one angle of issues as the gospel and any other idea must be wrong or even hateful.We need more examinations of issues like Jaye has done here. Thoughtful, measured... food for thought.I'm giving it 10/10 not because I agree or disagree with the ""conclusion"" of the movie. It is because it is only with this kind of calm delivery and discourse that we can move forward to resolve the many issues facing us today. Otherwise it's all just echo chamber shouting.Cassie Jaye - please keep making documentaries or anything really. Other film makers - please note what she has done here."
" Refreshing and entertaining, unfortunate approach
",-0.0258,-0.838,2017-09-18 00:00:00,7,"As entertainment this film does provide a refreshing perspective in an otherwise neglected area, not often portrayed objectively in the modern media landscape. It also scratches the surface of what could maybe be a more interesting topic, that of biased and twisted news reporting – something that is a genuine problem, considering a cloak and dagger crook like Trump somehow made to office... As a documentary, it's unfortunate that the narrative, as is common practice in gender issues it seems, takes on a comparative form of self reflection. Serious issues regarding men and male perspectives fall a bit flat and will fail to convince because of the narrative being comparing MRA to feminism, men vs. women – a narrative that only fuels the blame game, oppressed or oppressor, and widens the wedge between sexes rather than just focusing on mens' issues as legitimate problems without victimizing or faulting."

Just because you are a feminist doesn't mean you are not aware of the other inequalities that exist in the world; such as class and/or socio-economic discrimination, and racial Prejudice.

",0.1967,-0.6414,2017-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Genius how a 21 year old can produce such a mature and well balanced documentary.Are males being suppressed by feminists? Have we become so obsessed with feminism and equality that we actually have pushed it too far? Are we in need to take a good look at how we treat males in certain instances when it comes to law, specifically custodial battles.I must be honest and say that arguments like 'more men die in battle' is complete nonsense to me, as women are needed to produce men to wage war and god forbid we fill our armies up with females to a point of 50/50 globally, men would have to grow a womb.The difficulty with the MRA is that most men won't take them seriously because they exaggerate (in order to get attention), most men have a 'let it be' attitude and wont be passionate about key-issues as they may not apply to them, plus, most men have to face their wives back at home...... :-p"
" Makes you think
",0.0,0.958,2017-08-12 00:00:00,8,"This film is by no means perfect. It was sort of cheaply made, with some awkward editing, and lack of sound in many parts. I think one could argue that it fails to debunk feminism, but I would suggest that such was never the goal of the documentary.The Red Pill is so great because it makes its audience think and consider something that isn't so obvious. It's a film that challenges its audience, and brings to light not-so-visible issues. That's the main draw. It is important for both supporters and enemies of the Men's Rights movement, and I think anyone who has an interest in feminism should see this movie, even if they can guarantee that they won't agree with it. Another complaint I could include is that the documentary fails to talk about the internet culture of Men's Rights, where most are anonymous, embittered, and often misogynistic men. Despite its problems, I would endorse the film and again encourage all who are at all interested in the subject to watch."
" Surprisingly excellent for a newbie director
",0.7096,-0.983,2017-08-04 00:00:00,9,"OK, so it was funded by Kickstarter funds and her mom, because no self- righteous production house would support this effort. In fact, if you go to Rotten Tomatoes, you'll find metacritics' review of 33%, but user reviews of 91%. Why the difference? Because this director is honest about the confusion concerning mens' rights and how they're being eroded by feminism. Further, she demonstrates how the feministic ""cause"" has gone from helpful to destructive, by destroying mens rights rather than supporting women, both in the courts and politically. Back the RT reviews: Critics can't honestly compliment the film because they'd be identified as supremacists or racists or some other utterly false label that the feministas have decided to lay on the MRA movement. As an example, the Feminist claim that MRA is identified as a hate group by the Souther Poverty Law group is an outright lie. But since critics don't want to be labeled themselves, well, users have to review."

On domestic violence, a woman can literally play God with a man's life if she is willing to lie to police. Her word is taken as absolute gospel.

This movie is NOT about the Reddit forum of the same name. This movie was about trying to give voice to a group of people who are dismissed in society simply for having a contrarian point of view. Many of the reviews here reflect that dismissiveness.This movie is intended to provoke thought, and provide a counter argument to what we have been taught our entire lives. The feminists find that intimidating, and would rather scream from hallways, and block entrances than dare allow someone to disagree with them. A word of caution. If you believe that women are still oppressed in Western civilization, and men are the oppressors, your assumptions will be challenged."
" Cherry-picked nonsense
",-0.4019,-0.2263,2017-07-23 00:00:00,1,"I stumbled upon this film when it came across my Amazon Prime feed so I decided to take a blind adventure and see what the MRAs are all about.I have to start out by saying bravo to the filmmaker (Cassie Jaye) for documenting such a manipulative film complete with Alice in Wonderland silhouettes and an ending that seems almost too scripted.I have 2 main reasons for giving this title a 1/10 The first is because the filmmakers decided to mislead its audience by presenting the film as a fair look at both Men's Rights and Feminism. Between the cherry-picked statistics and the lack of recognition in regards to major issues and stances, the film falls flat on its ugly face. The second is the source of funding. Although this project may have started out as a pet project with personal funds and help from patrons on Kickstarter, you can't tell me that large funds donated by both Breitbart News and Milo Yiannopoulos had no influence on the film's message.If you really watched this film and claim it opened your mind, you need to take a hard look at the actual facts from both sides of the argument and maybe yourself as well."
" Balanced, fair, and a GREAT start to this director
",0.7983,0.9744,2017-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Sure, not the slickest of documentaries. Which is a bit surprising given she's done documentaries before. However, what makes it riveting is her indecision and uncertainty in face of the array of facts presented to her by various sides. This is further made intriguing by looking into the funding of the film, which is NOT (per feminist propaganda) coming primarily from a single source supporting the MRA movement, but rather from her mother and from various Kickstarter sources. It's one of the most unbiased approaches I've seen. I only wish such films would include interviews between two rational representatives of each side with a statistician in the room to keep their arguments honest. Then again, I've never seen that in a documentary, so I'll keep wishing. To the Director: Great Job. Be proud of your work, and keep this same, open, honest and balanced approach in your future work."
" A very powerful film, the ""Star Wars"" of gender ideology and equality
",-0.1298,0.9489,2017-07-19 00:00:00,10,"I would have to twist reality into a knot to criticize it. I've never been inspired as much as I have with this film, to get out of my chair and do something, other than go online and give it 10 stars. Having fact checked Cassie's data and confirmed it, my next step was to sign up on Patreon to be a supporter of her work.Her recent blogs where she voices concerns over the film being a career ending event, due to the backlash from radical feminist, should be easily dispelled by the storm of grassroots support she is now getting in places like IMDb. I have spent days searching online for views from both sides of the issue and I am finding an overwhelming amount of support and positive feedback for the film from both men and women.While professional critics have their job and role to fulfill, the more negative critiques will fall silent as the grass roots support swells.With such wide grass root support, it would be radioactive for any ideological, politically motivated, radical feminist to speak out publicly against the film. We are a democracy where free speech is celebrated not censored; by banning the film from theaters around the world, feminist have literally shot themselves in both feet. Blindly taking aim at anyone who offers views and opinions which don't fit their ideological point of view, they have given both Cassie and the MRM the kick start they needed to launch a national debate on the subject of men's rights.For the men naysayers who believe this is too little too late, or it will have negligible effect, let's not forget that the feminist movement has only been around, by and large, for forty years. It may not occur in my generation, but by the time my grandchildren are in their 30's, political, ideological and legal equality for both genders can be achieved, and free speech under democratic principles is where it has its start."
" Thought provoking and timely
",-0.2023,-0.978,2017-07-18 00:00:00,8,"This is the first film review that I have written. I decided to write this one in response to the vitriol aimed at this movie by those who would prefer it not be watched. I believe I approach this documentary without a misogynistic agenda; however, I am a man, which no doubt some will consider the same thing, and my life experience has caused me to suspect that many of the issues, so eloquently raised in this documentary by MRAs, are indeed real. I spent many years in the emergency services, in which I witnessed a fair amount of female on male violence, and yet found that the anti-domestic violence awareness programs I participated in only ever blamed men. I myself have been twice assaulted by intimate female partners, and after going through a divorce had to fight tooth and nail to retain 50% custody of my children. Thankfully, the laws here in NZ are not so draconian as in the US. I have a good friend who is a feminist and tried to discuss this movie with her. Our discussion essentially went along the lines of, if patriarchy exists to favour men and oppress women, why do men feature so disproportionately in negative statistics such as workplace deaths, metal illness, suicide, drug dependency, homelessness, and so on. I suggested that these stats imply that patriarchy in fact favours women, at least on some level. Needless to say, the conversation didn't go well, but why should a statement like this be so provocative? Surely this is worthy of discussion? I don't pretend that the movie is without fault. However, those who argue that it is biased, less than comprehensive, or worthless because it was apparently crowd-funded by MRA's seem to be setting an impossibly high expectation, no doubt because it provides an easy way to dismiss the content. Jaye asks some open and simple questions, and the answers she gets demand that more questions be asked. I personally found the images of feminist protesters yelling abuse into the faces of passive men to be extremely powerful. Whilst demanding that all men are violent rapists these women are depending on male restraint — a clear illustration of the apparent disparity between rhetoric and actual expectations. A later remark by a professor of gender studies, that men deserved to lose custody of their children because they are, apparently, absent fathers before divorce, is illuminating in its blatant use of victim blaming. These are just two instances in a series of examples that highlight the way in which men are culturally expected to shoulder the burden of rightfully punished oppressors of women. The question this movie asks is is this true, or are feminist values actually oppressing innocent men? I have a teenage son, and I will watch this movie with him, but whilst doing so, I will remind him that feminist concerns are also real and important, a point that several of the MRAs interviewed make. As such, I think that Jaye should be congratulated on a timely film that doesn't provide all the answers, but asks some serious questions."
" Gaslighting Propaganda
",-0.25,-0.9872,2017-07-18 00:00:00,1,"This is a great example of gaslighting and brainwashing. What it isn't is a well-balanced documentary from a critical thinker with skills of discernment. For example, Fred Hayward's one-sided account of his divorce and custody battle was drenched in self-pity and misogyny and an objective listener would have questioned his account. Even his own side of the story makes him seem controlling and emotionally abusive toward his ex-wife and their son. The fact that Cassie Jaye used this portion of her interview with Hayward in its entirety and didn't represent the account of the ex-wife and their son at all shows a mindlessness which has no place in the making of an objective documentary. Frankly, it weakens one of the points feminists agree with MRA people on-- equal parental rights.Cassie Jaye swallows the red pill without even asking what's in it. She unquestioningly accepts anecdotal evidence and opinion-as-fact statements over and over again from mansplaining misogynists. I don't believe Jaye ever was a feminist, and I question her motives.This film is pro-MRA propaganda. Did Cassie Jaye set out to make a propaganda film? If so, there's nothing inherently wrong in that. It's deceptive for a filmmaker to parade as an objective investigator when they're only looking for facts to bolster their own position, but filmmakers do it. It makes her no worse than Michael Moore. But what cause is she promoting here? The rights of men to abuse and rape? The rights of men to deny a partner her constitutional right to abortion? These are positions she glosses over, but they're major positions of MRA activists. And of course, all but three of the feminists she interviews are shrill, unreasonable, verbally abusive bordering on violent, and inarticulate.There are positions many Feminists and MRA activists COULD agree on if the MRA activists actually cared more about social justice than being superior to women: more balance in parental rights, worker safety, education for all children, the prevention of domestic violence against both men and women, and the questioning of routine circumcision of baby boys. Sadly, the MRA activists view equality as a threat, and this documentary only serves as evidence of their fragility."
" Not sure I can finish this film
",-0.2411,-0.7184,2017-07-17 00:00:00,1,"I'm only half way through and I find it missing the main point of feminism. Feminism is for men, women, children, people of color, and in my opinion, also animals (but that's hotly debated).It's about breaking the Patriarchy that sends men into imperialistic wars, it's about breaking the Patriarchy that creates male dominated jobs in which women are targeted if they try to break through.The director is obviously a ""white feminist"". Meaning she's not acknowledging the intersectionality of feminism that was ignored after white women usurped the second wave from black women that initiated it."
" A spectacular example of honest investigation.
",0.5106,0.926,2017-07-14 00:00:00,10,"This video was amazing, and the reason it's amazing, is because it displays honest research. In a media and entertainment environment where everything is bias, it was good to see other perspectives. The movie take a walk through Cassie Jaye's world view, and shows how hard it can be to question your own bias. The self-awareness, and her capacity to learn is a skill that people have forgotten."
" Interesting concept, terribly uncritical/naive approach
",-0.2263,-0.9805,2017-07-13 00:00:00,2,"The concept itself is fine, however the execution is terrible. It uncritically interviews various MRAs without anyone to argue against, except people who are essentially picked from the street. There is no one of authority (e.g. a leader of an organization, an activist, etc) to speak against the talking points.The result is a very uncritical movie where only one point of view is presented. It adds very little to the debate, as it simply represents the views of MRAs without any proper debate of them.Moreover, it lacks numbers and statistics necessary for a good documentary.The idea itself is interesting, but the way it is done is terrible. The host is very naive (if not maliciously misrepresenting her initial views).In conclusion, I have to give it 1, as it is a bad, nay awful, movie by standards of good documentary, which ought to be critical (although not outright denying), honest in its representation, etc. It is not honest (it might very well be one of the most dishonest documentaries, I've seen), nor critical (with the exception of short clips where they never go into depth, nor interview activists or 'serious' feminists)."

The difference I observed between the feminists and the men's rights proponents, is that the former do not want to listen to ANY of the issues raised by the latter, all they wanted to do was shut down the conversations though negative labelling, shouting down and behaviours that border on aggression (which is ironic, because the feminist movement is supposed to address domestic violence, yet comes across as aggressive). On the other hand, the proponents of men's rights were not trying to suppress women's issues -- they were trying to highlight some of the issues that men were facing, and not shut down dialogue. What a contrast. Our perceptions and culture are often shaped by mainstream media; and in this current world, on certain issues like gender equality, alternative opinions and worldviews are being silenced (one would not believe this until you see the evidence presented, really). This is a brave, counter cultural documentary -- Cassie Jaye, the young lady who made this documentary should be applauded."

What do I call myself when people ask? Cassie Jaye called herself a feminist. Her first act of bravery was wading into the 'enemy' camp. How many of us even have the stomach to read the blog of someone with opposing political views, let alone spend personal time with them and film for a documentary? What I loved most was Cassie's personal reflections. We all do this every day. Am I doing the right thing? Is my life better for all this time I'm spending doing blah-blah- blah? She waded in, she filmed her most personal questioning moments. And in the end, she opened her eyes, looked at the evidence and said, ""The horse I'm backing isn't even a horse. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing biting anyone who dares question it's battered sheep agenda."" Bravo. May I learn from you and practice the self-reflective honesty you showed. I hope so."
" Not Good
",-0.3412,-0.9618,2017-06-19 00:00:00,4,"I love documentaries, but this was propaganda. All Jaye did was interview people with certain views, and supported their incorrect statistics without changeling them. I remember one fact about how more men died in the Koren War. Duh. People didn't allow women to fight, they were nurses in combat. I wonder who made that choice. Oh right, a man. Yet that isn't brought into conversation. If she is a feminist, one of the questions should ask Elam is ""If this was October would you pull my hair and smash my head into a wall?"" I'm female and cannot completely grasp the ideal of male struggles, but I do know that the media and traditional morals put men in a box and that's an issue that all of these ideals stem from. I also think Jaye is letting these men tell their stories (which is nice) to back-up their beliefs, but she doesn't mention that just because the men involved in bad situations does not mean it is that way for everyone. I gave it a four because I did learn more topics some males feel oppressed by, but I didn't get any truth or back and forth commentary like a documentary is suppose to have."
" Worth a gander, hold the slack jawed acceptance
",0.5994,-0.9963,2017-06-18 00:00:00,4,"If you can wade past the misleading statistics and personal anecdotes, this film does discuss a worthwhile topic and offer a few moments of insight. However, it uses a seriously FLAWED and misdirected movement as the vehicle.In short, I think the discussions with the feminist talking heads and Erin Pizzey were the most valuable portions of the film.Those moments aside, this movie is guilty of focusing on the pixels rather the whole image.Pixels. Granted there are areas where men are at a disadvantage, such as family court. Yet, the case made in the film is weak. Aside from custody rates (which notice how the key qualifying term ""physical"" is not used in the film), there are no stats used in this portion of the case in the film. Perhaps that's because the vast majority of custody decisions are made by the adults involved independently or with a mediator and only 5% of the cases are decided by a court trial. Or perhaps no stats were used in this portion of the film because the vast majority of custody decisions are for joint custody with it mutually agreed upon that mom has physical custody. Pixel. Power in procreation decisions. Women have more power here says the film/MRA. Okay, but we are talking about adults engaging in adult activities in most cases correct? As such, isn't it time to grow up and recognize that there are consequences to the choices we make? And isn't becoming an adult involve the recognition that some choices have consequences which one cannot escape the fallout. The one nearly universal choice that has permanent consequences is the creation of life. If made in a drunken stupor, made in a flash of lust or made with a human that lacks integrity, there are consequences. The question becomes, is it society's job to clean up after the mess or do the parties need to adult up and move forward putting something other than themself as the priority? MRA advocate for society to sort it out. Some may hear ""1984"" on the wind as they make their case....Another Pixel. Men are at a disadvantage with social services to support them when they are victims of abuse, violent crime, etc. Probably the most sound argument in the film. The cry out for equality in support services needs to be heeded. I suspect it will with the legitimization of same sex marriages. The system is behind the curve, as it always is. Yet, this lack of support existing today does not necessarily legitimize the case for MRA types. Rather, again likely illustrates the impact of the underlying root cause. The big picture--something the film never explores. More Random Pixels: war deaths, dangerous jobs, circumcision, etc. On these issues, the film seriously entertains the blame game played by MRA advocates.However, root causes again. Are women the perpetrators who force men into military service, dangerous work, shorter lives, successful suicide attempts, misguided chivalry, circumcision, etc. To drive home the analogy of this review one last time: failure to explore the root causes of these things is the equivalent of focusing on the pixels of a painting such as the one by Georges Seurat, rather than the image it creates. This film seems to consciously choose to ignore the big picture. The film systematically Ignores the context of all the issues it raises. Rather, it twists it all into a navel gazing experience of a recently repented ""feminist"".The movie never questions why MRA types focus significant energy on tearing down feminism. In fact the film creates a platform for MRA adherents to specifically blame feminists. Much time is given to their opinions on the unfair laws in family matters. However are the family court laws truly unfair or are they just arcane? I mean things have changed dramatically since the start of the boom in divorce and women returning to work. But have the laws adapted accordingly?And the omissions in the film, fairly egregious. If you are going to explore MRA, then lets take a good look at it. The one omission I find quite disturbing is the Santa Barbara mass shooting. After all, this film was made in 2015 or so and that shooting generated the largest media attention MRA adherents have ever received by the general populace. If you take a look at that incident, the bible verse Matthew 7:16 comes to mind.Its sad that this film is so bad because there is a crisis in masculinity as defined in western culture. And there are groups that are working to raise these issues which deserve support and attention. Efforts like the Good Men Project, Toxic Masculinity, Men Can Stop Rape. And the films Good Boy and American Male.... No cause that has yet to correctly identify their enemy should be allowed to enjoy credibility because they have latched onto a few slivers of truth. If that was the case, then the white supremacists should deserve the same treatment in a film."
" Eye Opening and Definitely Worth Watching
",0.5574,0.9657,2017-06-17 00:00:00,9,"Firstly, thank you Cassie Jaye for making this film and I can't apologise enough for the hatchet jobs the media did in Australia on your visit here to promote your film. I loosely align with MGTOWs and MRAs and like you recognise that there are victims on both sides. Despite what many feminists think, MRAs exist to promote men's issues - not to bring down women, just like feminism exists to promote women's rights - not to bring down men. Obviously radicals exist on both sides that seem to be the loudest voices and do no favours for their respective groups. Ultimately this movie explores the journey of Cassie who at the start is a feminist as she explores the world of men's rights and how she learns that there is another side to the story. I think most reasonable people agree that both men and women are suffering in different ways and that we need to work together to make sure that both genders can live in true equality. This does not promote misogyny despite what many biased organisations may say."

What I found out is women talk with emotions to get everything they want, men come with facts that side with them, and still lose.This movie is a worthy watch, such a shame ladies get all the advantages, such as courts, marriage, money, divorce, support and men really do not get anything.Men work harder and longer than women and females get hired more, work less hours and get more benefits.This is just the surface of what this movie has in it. It has a wealth of info, but also goes into a personal level with interviews with men who simply are born to die."
" Stunning
",0.3818,0.6186,2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"An incredibly powerful movie. I was brought to tears more than once, but one time I had to stop the movie - I couldn't go on for a good five minutes.The sad part is evidenced by my wife, who, even though she is not an active feminist, refuses to watch it. This is supported by the reviews: 2,243 males have reviewed it, giving it an average rating of 8.8, but only 220 females, with an average of 7.6. It seems that rather than watch something which may challenge their beliefs, women choose not to listen to something which may contradict their world view.As well as it being a very powerful documentary because of its content, the technical movie-making aspects are exceptionally good. At various times I was stunned at the photography, and the structure and delivery of the story is excellent.Summary - I believe everyone who watches it will be deeply moved. It's such a shame that 90% of them will be male."
" Would r8 8/8 m8
",0.34,-0.9612,2017-06-06 00:00:00,10,The movie does a great job showing Cassie Jaye's struggle between her feminist beliefs and what she's learning and finds that everything is now what it had seemed. Her entire worldview is being challenged and she doesn't know what to do. Talking to both feminists and MRAs alike.When she learns (spoilers ahead) about what Boko Haram does in Africa - killing the boys and sending the girls off - she wonders why the media doesn't cover this. She hears stories of fathers losing custody battles and committing suicide because they can't see their kids anymore. She learns about the male suicide rates and how little choice the man has in whether to be a father or not. (end of spoilers) These are only a few of the many things she learns and it all conflicts with the narratives she's been hearing for a while as a feminist.Going down the rabbit hole is a wild ride.
" Don't believe the hype
",0.0,0.9889,2017-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Men or women. Black or white. West or East. We all have a view and we seldom question where that viewpoint comes from or how we developed it. This documentary highlights a pervasive trend in our society that presents a one sided narrative spun by vested interest groups that impoverishes us all and how we can be deceived into believing something that is partially, or simply, not true.It also highlights people's intransigence to change their viewpoint. It is so ironic to be faced by such naked anger and denial by those who claim to speak for justice and truth. I found this documentary both affirming and challenging. I would strongly recommend everyone to sit down and watch it. It is not the whole picture on the issue of gender equality but rather the start of a dialogue. I liked what the guy had to say at the end about common sense. In a perfect world men and women would be treated fairly and equally but because it is not, feminism gave rise to the MRA. This documentary shows the birth of a well meaning group that has a legitimate case to make. The problem I have is that all these groups eventually become as bad as each other. First they start with noble aspirations then they become popular and gain funding, which leads to vested interests shutting down all opposition in a struggle for power and influence. A journey which develops strategies for lobbying and campaigning exclusively for their own particular rights, often at the expense of the rights of many others.As a society we all need to grow up and take our responsibilities more seriously than we esteem our rights. We need to listen more than we espouse. We need to learn to understand more about who we truly are than protest about how we think we all should be. However, people are too often the same old creatures and there is nothing new under the sun. Fairness is still an aspiration for too many. Justice is too often the possession of the powerful and the majority would still prefer to live with a comfortable lie than struggle with a challenging truth.I was impressed by this young film maker's effort to understand. She struggled with the narrative she had believed but did not shy away from suspending disbelief. She let the facts speak for themselves. An admiral and sadly rare quality in this media-headline crazed world. A recommended watch for all those who wish to be challenged."
" A ""woe is me"" look at MRAs
",-0.4215,-0.9231,2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,"This ""documentary"" was pretty ridiculous. If only these poor men understood that patriarchy is at fault for 99.9% of their complaints. Its slow and repetitive, and there is no actual debate on any topic. Too bad the filmmaker missed an opportunity to have an actual conversation, instead of just giving these men a platform to express their misplaced fears and beliefs."
" Insightful, yet has severe shortcomings
",-0.3818,0.9383,2017-06-04 00:00:00,6,"This film is pretty good at illustrating grievances men have and that all is not rosy on the men side. Had this documentary focused on only that, this would have been a pretty good film. However, this was not just documenting MRA. The film is just as much about the directors conversion to MRA. Which at the end is MRA documentary about MRA, which raises the question: is this documentary honest? To give an example, throughout the film there are multiple references to statistics of deaths. Let's take workplace fatalities, where 4584 died, of which where 93% were men. The MRA position is that men lives are worth less than that of women. The documentary doesn't analyse the statistics. 4584 fatalities in population of 316m is 0,0015%. Over the years the value of men life has increased, as indicated by increase of work safety standards. The film doesn't even try to figure out why there are disproportionally fewer women in such jobs. MRA claims that men do it because they must provide for family. Perhaps it is so because it is not socially acceptable for women to be coal miners? Again, it would be fine if the documentary was ""What MRA believes"", but this documentary slides into ""What the world really is like"". And I would expect more thorough interrogations of facts presented.Speaking of interrogation. The witness selection was rather interesting. On the feminist side they brought in Chanty Binx (Big Red?), yet the director outright dismissed the Red Pill subreddit as not the real MRA. It seems like the director chose witnesses to reflect her own beliefs.TL;DR. If you want to see a 2h video on how Mens Rights activists want to see themselves, this documentary is exactly that. However, this film is documentary about what the movement is."
" Good look at the current status of gender politics
",0.4404,0.8225,2017-06-03 00:00:00,10,"I'm going to score this movie a 10 because I believe that how much this movie deserves the attention at this point in time and history.As for an actual score, as in how good I think the movie is, I would score it an 8.5.The movie is well made and professionally edited. OK, some slightly smoother camera work and in one case better sound (but they used subtitles to fix this) could have been used. But overall a very good job.The one thing I would critique this movie on is that Cassie didn't seem to ask many confrontational questions. The speakers were always giving their opinions but I haven't really seen Cassie retort with a difficult question or opposing view. Especially when interviewing the feminist guests.Other than that I can only say this movie comes at the right time, which the controversy around the movie clearly shows. MRA's do not want to take away from women. They simply want to shed a light on the plight of men who are seen as disposable."
" Brilliant

" The Red Pill 2016 Movie Review
",0.0,0.8877,2017-05-30 00:00:00,10,"WARNING: some possible spoilersBefore I even begin to write a review of this documentary / movie, let's give credit to where its truly due;Director: Cassie JayeExecutive Producer: Evan DaviesProducers: Nena Jaye, Anna Laclergue, Cassie JayeAssociate Producers: Jake Acer, Paul Cavanaugh, Michael Cernovich, Thomas Ingoglia, Brain and Tanja SnodgrassDirector of Photography: Evan DaviesCamera Operators: Nena Jaye, Cassie Jaye, Elliot Holland, Teryl Brouillette, Steve BruleEditor: Cassie JayeComposer: Douglas EdwardTitle Designer: Chad EarlySupervising Sound Editor: Dave NelsonOriginal Music by: Red AlphaAll of the above did an awesome job to produce a phenomenal movie. Hats off to everyone individually. Oops, they don't have an emoticon for ""hats off"" in text yet. As a suicide counselor for more than two decades, I can easily connect the dots between my male clients (I don't charge them fees but still could not find a better word) and the men's issues raised in the movie. This movement has not even grown out of its infancy stage and there are already two splinter groups i.e. MGTOW (men go their own way) and Reddit's THE RED PILL. Without getting into gender politics or my own personal take on men's rights, I'd stick to the actual review of the movie. As a feminist, when she takes a genuine look into the men's world, it confuses the hell out of her. Throughout the movie, she continues to express her frustration between the two points of views. And in the end, she actually loses her own feminist ideology. Its not clear if she actually joined the men's movement or pretty much decided to stay neutral towards both. But she did a great favor to the men's rights movements by taking an initiative alognwith her awesome team of producers. Erin Pizzey is a living proof since 1971 how difficult it is to raise a voice for men's issues. In one of the old video recordings featured in the documentary, the very women who took refuge in her USA's first Women's Refuge house, admitted of being physically violent women towards their own men. That was an eye-opener especially when it was more than 40 years old. If women were physically that abusive back then, imagine how the feminist movement since then has affected an average woman's mind towards committing violence against men today.If I was a woman and I watched this movie, I'd become more forgiving towards men than following the popular culture's lead onto hitting a man whenever I feel wronged. The whole system (including legal and social) is behind me to wrongly accuse men, after all.Even though Cassey Jaye's selection of interviewees was more weighted towards men's rights (understandably), what surprised me was her inclusion of some feminists, even extremist feminazis to present a balanced view. Unfortunately, when given the opportunity to defend feminism, none of the feminist interviewees did an impressive job. From the men's rights point of view, I particularly liked the interview of Fred Hayward of Men's Rights Inc. His was truly a tragic personal life's backdrop that inspired him to become attracted to this new movement. The real gem of the whole movie is the interview of Harry Crouch, Founder of NCFM. His office actually showcases the heart-breaking pictures of the fathers who committed suicides due to biased court system and many other harrowing statistics of crimes committed against men by women. A couple of seconds view of his office truly impressed me about his dedication and professionalism into following his cause. Lastly, when I saw Cassie Jaye's tears due to tragedies happening to men, an idea came to my mind. She should try to make an equally awesome movie about Feminism today. This will sort of neutralize her soul's pain seeing only one side of the coin. Her feelings are genuine, so are her tears. I am sure those tears will flow equally the same when she will hear same sort of tragedies happening to women of today. I don't know about Cassey Jaye's audience much, but she did showcase her own growing intellectually very well through this movie / documentary. Hats off to her too (if I forgot doing that in the opening paragraph)."
" Beauty of a show

We see them with their balding heads or bright red hair, and we think, ""why can't they be pretty?""And then the camera pans back to our star, the beautiful Cassie Jaye. For those of you who don't know, Cassie Jaye is an actress and director who, unfortunately, never got the leading roles I believe she deserves. We don't see nearly enough of her pretty face out there. So this show, not sure what it's about, is a good way to highlight her beauty.This show might be about something political, or something. But the point is, we get to see Cassie. Thank you Cassie, and keep up the good work. I give Cassie a 9 out of 10."

She presented the issues men face with an unbiased approach and let both men's rights activists and staunch feminists speak freely on the topics at hand. This movie will upset social justice warriors that ignore statistics and blindly argue to benefit themselves and their agenda, but it will also upset people that have been victims of the system and are reminded of how quickly a woman can ruin a man's life without a shred of truth behind their accusations. It even brought me to tears when some men discussed losing their children in custody battles that were beyond unfair, but this movie covers many different issues regarding gender equality and the battles faced from both sides. In our society, there are times when it is better to be a man and there are times when it is better to be a woman. Men and women are different and do not completely understand one another, which is why this movie is so important. If we can openly discuss these issues and respect men and women as individuals, rather than just seeing certain issues in black and white, the world will be a much better place for everyone."

Hopefully this can (just as the large number of ""eye opening"" vegan-movies coming out over the last 10 years) help create a fact-based discussion, concerned with all people; not just one gender."
" Good documentary - some improvements could have been made
",0.6369,0.8341,2017-05-23 00:00:00,9,"This was a pretty good documentary on pointing out some of the systematic oppression that men face in modern society that people are afraid to point out.I do wish that Cassie had pushed back a little harder against the feminist interviewees and the MRA interviewees both. There were some suspicious claims on both, and one of the feminists in particular was particularly dismissive of some of the sexist issues facing men. The other feminist was pretty decent, even if I didn't agree with everything said.Among the MRAs, all but one was compelling and their arguments made sense. A little bit of googling after the movie and I found that, at least within the context of the United States, most of their claims checked out.Overall I give it a 9, but a healthy dose of that was the immense bravery to speak out on an issue that will get you immediate backlash (as has been observed). Were it not for that factor, I'd give it a 7, as there was no investigative push back on the claims, and there should have been.The bit about Boko Haram (i won't spoil it completely) really shocked me. It really shows that male disposability is a real thing, and we need to be doing something about it."
" A Puff Piece for the Men's ""Rights"" Movement
",0.0,0.7736,2017-05-22 00:00:00,1,"The documentarian, who claims (without much in the way of credentials) to be a feminist embarking upon an honest exploration of the men's ""rights"" movement, in fact provides a platform for the more presentable of that group's proselytizers to make their case without fear of serious opposition. No tough questions are asked. Feminist perspectives are given short shrift. In fact, the filmmaker seems to have taken great pains to only include scenes of feminists at their most shrill and objectionable. Meanwhile, the leaders of the men's movement appear to be on their best behavior. The sloganeering and misogyny of the Red Pill forum on Reddit are in short supply here, although in fairness, the deranged hatred and fear of women does bleed through despite everyone's best efforts to contain it. So my very strong suspicion is that this ""documentary"" is actually a set-up piece, at least partly funded by the very movement it claims to investigate — which is likely why ads for it appear on some of the reprehensible blogs dedicated to advancing men's ""rights"" along with typical woman-bashing spew. I think this should be categorized not as an actual documentary, but as propaganda."

I thought feminism was simply a shining light to the artificial inequalities between genders - I say artificial because natural inequalities persist through time; Biology has always been an obstacle to true equality - but perhaps feminism is becoming (or has become) a more encompassing and aggressive ideology as it grows in size and momentum. I still believe that a more moderate form of feminism is essential to gender equality; I just don't know if it exists the way that I imagined, and still imagine it. It's sad to think that some friendships may have been lost when making this movie. Finding one's identity often involves losing things in the process. I do hope for reconciliation. It's important not to let labels define who we are, but only provide a starting point for a conversation that we all desperately need to have. Thank you, Cassie! Your earnestness served the movie well. It was a movie that desperately needed a feminist to make."

An example: I posted a meme on Facebook which showed the percentage of men and women in regards to suicide, deaths in workplaces and wars, etc. The first couple of reactions was ""get a f*****g grip man!"" and some same old ""women has it much worse in general"" and so on. This is especially from feminists. So I can't even point out facts about the world if it is about men's problems. How the h**l did we end up here?An eloge to the director for the will to understand and listen!

" The Red Pill
",0.0,0.7955,2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"So I finally got round to watching The Red Pill last night and have been wondering what to say about it. I have my own personal reservations about parts of how it is made - the interviews are all far too brief and so often little more than soundbites, barely scratching the surface of complex issues and showing practically none of the mountain of evidence and reason the MRAs routinely use to back up their arguments. In my opinion the film could have used 20 or 30 percent more of that and 20 or 30 percent less shots of Cassie Jaye driving around the streets of America and looking thoughtfully into the distance. I also would have liked less two-sentence interviews with people we never get to see again, and more time spent with Erin Pizzey, Karen Straughan, Paul Elam and Warren Farrell, all of whom could easily fill a documentary of their own. She seemed a little indiscriminate in her choice of interviewees, and more than a little random in what she decided to have them say.But on the other hand, no-one has ever done this before, taken the Men's Human Rights Movement and turned it into an entertaining and compelling movie fit to be shown in theatres, and that counts for a lot in itself. The bottom line is once I started watching I couldn't stop, really enjoyed the experience, and, all content aside, thought it looked amazing.If you're wanting a one-stop guide to the many and varied arguments, beliefs and philosophical positions of the red-pilled world, well then this film may well leave you wanting. But if you go in with the understanding it is an outsider's view documentary about one individual woman's journey through the current state of gender politics in the 21st century, I can't see you having any good reason to complain."
" The truth hurts
",-0.2023,-0.2263,2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,The reaction to this film by a certain group only enforces what is shown in it. Just look at some of the first reviews on here complaining about men ''whining''. What this film has done is shown the hypocrisy of a large portion of feminists and how much against real equality they are. The very reason why Cassie no longer calls herself a feminist.
" Wow, that was bad. Really, really awful.
",-0.5059,0.8971,2017-05-08 00:00:00,1,"I'm a man, and have even been involved in men's rights and fathers rights in the past. But I must call this out - that was just truly terrible 'film-making'. There was no effort to separate truth from history, from anecdote or just clear lies. It is a collection of random, sometimes frightening conspiracy theories and personal stories from some (clearly very hurt) men's personal lives. The film maker made no effort to examine personalities or dig deeper or look for answers. She recorded some very bitter men complaining about their own personal experiences and tries to pass it off as film, as entertainment. There is no effort to understand the other side as good film makers and strong documentaries do. It was bland, empty, and obviously false. It reminded me of the kind of fake film-making Blair Witch Project was - deliberately and blatantly pretending to be documentary, almost satirically. It would be well at home on a comedy show, break the characters down as funny players in 3 minute skits and have a good old laugh at dark humour. But, I felt dirty after watching it, almost guilty that my gender-kind would behave so poorly, but even dirtier knowing this has been recorded for posterity and passed off as fact. How did this make it to film?Awful film making, truly just terrible. There are obviously about 1900 MRA's who have come and praised this 'film' to bump up it's rating (possibly the same MRA's who donated to see it completed when it ran out of money) and about 50 people who saw it like me and struggled to find the energy to care enough to write an honest review - hence the lopsided 8.9 rating. People know."
" A propaganda film for Men's Rights Activists (MRA)
",-0.25,-0.9904,2017-05-07 00:00:00,2,"Throughout film history the documentary stands as a trusted format for documenting the truth. But there are many documentaries that are propaganda films in disguise and The Red Pill (2016) is one of them. Rather than present a balanced perspective on the gender politics behind the Men's Rights Activists movement (MRA) the film is a vehicle for promoting MRA views.The Red Pill is the work of American documentarian Cassie Jaye who presents her personal journey from feminist to supporter of the MRA movement. She explains that while looking for inspiration for her next film she stumbled across reports of the 'rape-culture' associated with the MRA. Unable to find funding because of the MRA's right wing connections, the film was eventually crowdfunded despite protests around the world and cancelled screenings in Australia. The film is mostly talking- heads explaining MRA's ideology and grievances. It is interspersed with clips where Jaye tearfully monologues her emerging sympathy for the MRA and their claims of systemic discrimination against males. The main examples offered is that 99% of military casualties are male with similar statistical disparities for industrial accidents. Conversely, the number of domestic abuse shelters for men are negligible. The proportion of adverse judicial findings against men in cases involving child custody, domestic violence, and rape are also cited as evidence of male oppression.If the aim of The Red Pill was to record Jaye's transition to MRA supporter then it is a success. But if it is to examine the MRA movement in contemporary gender discourse it has limited value. There are glaringly obvious editing biases that even a novice filmmaker could have avoided. For example, there is a complete imbalance between the amount of air-time given to reasonable-sounding MRA voices with sympathetic eye-contact compared to the selective clips of ranting feminists screaming profanities. The bulk of this repetitive two-hour film is an MRA grievance platform with virtually no countervailing viewpoints or contextual perspective. There is complete silence on the male-dominated historical forces behind MRA statistics. For example, it does not ask why war is a male-driven industry in which old men send young men to battle, nor does it ask why men continue to abuse women and drive them into domestic violence shelters. It is also silent on the many inflammatory public comments made by MRA spokesmen that demean women and condemn feminism. Ironically, the opening scene citing rape-culture is never revisited.Through its selective inclusion of MRA grievances and its total silence on the systemic analysis of their root causes, this film commits denialism by omission. It's sympathetic coverage of right-wing masculinist propaganda together with the director's tearful journey towards MRA fandom is a manipulative use of the documentary format. However, obstructing or banning this film gives it undeserved attention. Most who see it will recognise its ideological bias and myopic conclusions. By renouncing feminism and becoming an MRA spokeswoman, Cassie Jaye is a living example of the persuasive power of the new right-wing masculinist propaganda."

And then it started.Yes there are flaws in The Red Pill, the editing distracted me a few times, and there was a lot of fact dumping from the MRA's. But I can excuse the fact dumping because that's what they are, facts. Watching this documentary I noticed how all of the feminists interviewed would constantly straw man the MRAs as an excuse to ignore them or belittle them. It may have been the way Cassie Jaye put the interviews together, but looking at the many transition shots that were completely candid I believe otherwise.I left this documentary confused, a little angry, but most importantly changed. There's just the right amount of information to give you a broad understanding of the topics while enticing you to do your own research as well. I give this a perspective shifting 9/10 and most certainly recommend this documentary to everyone who wants to go down the rabbit hole and take The Red Pill."

",-0.6249,-0.9453,2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,A feminist explores the world of male rights activism. She comes out the other end renouncing her feminist ideology. The film itself manages to find many remarkably insightful comments. Surprisingly many of the most insightful comments are by women. This documentary lets the facts speak for themselves.It's certainly not what it's portrayed to be... and the negative publicity is just helping the movie gain more traction. Do women have anything to fear from this documentary? No. Do feminists? No. Yet feminists feel threatened by it. Feminists seem to know very little about what's in it. If they did it seems unlikely they would respond so violently? The problem seems to be that feminists seem disinclined to listen? They seem hell bent on demonising other feminists in particular. The documentary shows a continuing pattern of bad behaviour by feminists which is quashing a meaningful discussion. Pity... because all sides have a lot to gain from some open dialogue.The documentary is just as relevant to women as men. It has the power to touch the hearts of many women and change their world view?Do yourself a favour and watch this.:-)

" Illuminating, but don't expect much to change though
",0.0,-0.9519,2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"As an avid YouTube watcher I had random video appear on my recommendations about 6 months ago. It was called 'Feminist Fail'. It really was very random as I had never searched or looked at anything like this before. However, I was curious and watched it and found it really funny. So I looked at a few more of these 'Feminist Fail' videos and became really hooked.Why were these Feminist videos so amusing? As a man, a rational person of high intelligence. It was so curious to see the 'Facts' versus 'Feelings' stand off. The man, the anti-feminist, would state reasoned arguments, listing various reports and statistics from peer reviewed journals and the woman, feminist, would completely ignore the statistics and rant and rave about feelings, ideologies, victim blaming, patriarchy, oppression, sexism, racism. Then in the most bizarre turn of events would become the victim themselves, when they were finally losing the argument, as their rants couldn't refute the logic.The above is how I became aware of Feminism, more accurately 'Third Wave Feminism' and the Mens Rights Movement and MGTOW and The Red Pill.So I was aware of the growing inequality in men's and women's rights in certain areas for perhaps 20 or 30 years or so. Particularly in the area of parenting and custody rights with the obvious bias in courts and civil authorities towards the mother or in divorce cases towards the woman.My view on this was it is something society has to go through now in order to get to the other side. Equality in these matters will come eventually but we aren't ready yet. Women have to have their time in the limelight until things go too far the other way that a clear and obvious bias is apparent to the point it cannot be ignored anymore.The only problem with this above premise is I don't think we are anywhere near that stage yet. Usually things only change when something so gross happens that it just makes everyone stand up and take notice. Like 9/11 did for terrorism.But what can do that for Mens Rights? Well you hear stories about crazy women killing their kids so the father can't have custody. Or despicable celebs joking that cutting off a mans junk is acceptable if he has cheated on you or some other such 'affront' This only gets brief coverage, if hardly at all, in the media. The media, as highlighted in this film, is very biased towards women's issues and men's issues just aren't cared about at all.That is why I say that society is not ready for equality yet for men. The women's movement is still on the climb and gathering momentum. This film is a great film to watch and helps, but unfortunately, it is just a drop in a very large ocean.So I really, really enjoyed watching this film. Cassie Jay did a really good job. But don't expect anything to change. I'm not saying that men's right activists shouldn't keep having their say or trying to get their message across or that films like this shouldn't be made. All I am saying is that it's going to be some time before things change and it's going to get a lot worse before that happens. Because only when things are completely beyond reasonable are people really going to take notice or realize there is a problem."
" A Good Introduction to Men's Issues but not to Their Online Advocates
",0.2382,0.9035,2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Spoiler alert. This film pleased me by avoiding the temptation to give the audience a dose of guilt by association. It disappointed me by giving me a dose of innocence by association. I did not want to see men's issues discredited by the flaws of their online spokesmen. But neither did I want to see cyberbullies get a free pass because of their association with legitimate moral issues. It is a good conversation starter, which is the hope that the film maker, Cassie Jaye, expressed in several interviews.This documentary maker clearly has a heart for -- and wants her audience to have a heart for -- the moral choices confronting us once we know about the many mistreated men who mostly suffer in silence. It would take a cold heart and a closed mind to feel no empathy and no pangs of conscience when presented with the statistics and with a few of the statistics' human faces. It is to the film maker's credit that she was able to feel empathy for her subjects in spite of feeling, by her own admission in several interviews, terrified and intimidated by them.About those initial feelings of being terrified and intimidated, though. It would take a heavy-duty enabler to see nothing at all wrong with the cyber bullying of some of the premiere alpha male internet troll kings. Not all but too many of them appear to want to wear a Pope hat and a pirate hat at the same time. While doing so, they still feel angered if they are not regarded as speaking with moral authority.Before the film maker ever decided to make her film, the reality was that there was already a very well established and very unhealthy dynamic surrounding the discussion of men's issues. The dynamic goes like this. Men's rights activists get almost entirely negative feedback outside of their groups. They get almost entirely positive feedback within it. A more healthy dialogue on the issues would mean that we would discuss these topics the same way, with the same standards, we would discuss any other subject. This would involve neither all positive nor all negative feedback.Again, I think this film could and should serve as a conversation starter, like the film maker expressed in interviews that she hoped it would. She did a good job in one way. She avoided the temptation to discredit men's issues by using the tactic of guilt by association. But she failed in another respect, because she did not do the one thing to MRAs that they always say they want of women. They always say they want women to be morally accountable. But the film maker did not hold MRAs morally accountable.To be fair to her, in the real world, she would have been left with no friends at all if she had held these guys morally accountable in her film. She had already lost most of her feminist friends and supporters during film making. Those friends and supporters left her without a support network. As it was, the resulting work is a compromise, but not the worst compromise it might have been."
" Thought-provoking, alarming in parts, perhaps biased but worth watching.
",0.1406,0.8927,2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"This documentary gave a very shocking slant on modern gender politics in the USA and across the world. However, I felt that it appeared to be biased in the choice of interviewees, it seemed to pick the most rational and clearheaded MRA spokesmen but the feminists interviewed were without exception presented as utterly insane, selective editing? Surely this can't be a representative sample of modern feminism? A good follow-on would be a documentary on the commercialisation/professionalisation of feminism which was picked up on but not explored. Despite the slant towards mens rights this documentary would also be of interest to those concerned about media manipulation as it explored several stories that had been picked up by MSM and twisted beyond all recognition to fit a popular narrative."

Thank you."
" A well made documentary which gives a fair view of both sides.
",0.5267,-0.9409,2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Since feminism is the main theme in this documentary, you will probably notice that you either love it or you hate it, depending on where you stand in the question. But there is one thing i think both sides can agree on, feminism has become a huge beast politically and that brings up a good question, is that something good? I think that the main strength of this movie is the fact that Cassie keeps an open mind the entire movie and listens to both sides of the issue. This is something that many documentary about a political issue fails to deliver, if you ever seen a Moore documentary you know that he means well but is obviously so partial that it's on the point of leaving the documentary sphere.The issues cover a fairly large spectrum of problems men are facing. But for me, the most problematic thing is how the feminists (Protestors) silence any kind of opposition, writing it of as hate speech. This is very dangerous from a political stand point because if you never are challenged in your political belief it will never continue to evolve. You will become a person that is not interested in anything but your own value. ""Big Red"" is prime example of a person who refuse to listen to any point of view other than her own. Without criticism political science is nothing else than a stroke of the ego. When you are talking about a political movement, ""Being loud"" is not something to be proud of. My favorite part of the entire movie was the protesters, who are trying to silence the opposition because they hate what they say. They are so caught up in their own bubble that they cannot see that their actions are a far cry from the intellectual feminism from the 60's and 70's. Instead of having a discourse about the issue, they scream and make noise to silence those who they hate.There are valid points from both sides in this movie (Excluding Big Red and other protesters). Domestic violence is a huge problem, regardless if it's a man or a woman who gets beaten. It's sad that people think its fun when a woman beats up her husband. It's sad man do not have the right to defend himself (Because boys should not hit girls). All in all i think it was a pretty good experience. It's just sad that most people who will watch this will enter with a mindset that feminism is either the best thing in the world or the worst. Always keep an open mind, or you will get stuck."
" Starting a conversation, as they say.
",0.0,0.6962,2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Truth and integrity are exceptionally rare these days, especially coming from anything in the media. Director Cassie Jaye is to be commended for presenting such an honest perspective of the issues she covers here.The Red Pill movie is an exploration of the Men's Right Movement and features interviews of people from both sides of the fence. Cassie is a quietly personable interviewer, rather than being provocative or hogging the screen. She never asks leading questions or uses other sneaky interview tactics, instead allowing her subjects to speak openly about their viewpoints. She then contrasts those views with one another and gives you factual tidbits. In doing this she has created a highly thought-provoking movie, no matter what your current opinion may be.And that seems to be the point of the movie: to get you to think and to arouse your curiosity.This is by no means a hit piece on feminism (or the MRA). Women's rights are spoken of with respect and sensitivity and there is no one promoting violence or sexism against women. In the end, as with all of the best movies, this was about our shared humanity. People spoke about their hopes and pains and their personal journeys.It was poignant to see Erin Pizzey, the founder of the world's first women's shelter, speak about her ostracization by the feminist movement. Although it's not included in the movie, Erin had to flee her home country under armed guard in the '70s after multiple death threats from feminists, who killed her family's dog and threatened her children. All because she said that women were also capable of being violent. (Government stats show that approximately half of domestic violence is against men). Erin wanted to offer shelter to men as well and because of this she has been banned from being a part of feminist organizations.However, as I said before, this movie is a brief lifting-of-the-lid of the MRA and is not meant to be an answer to feminist dogma. As such, there are still many issues it leaves unaddressed. But that's OK. You can only say so much in one movie. And besides, I prefer this personal exploration of Cassie's, rather than a hard hitting statistical take-down, because it's much more accessible and relatable for the average person.Of course, Cassie does reveal official facts and figures for the topics she investigates and many viewers will find them eye-opening. These facts won't be popular or comfortable, but the truth rarely is. At least, at first."
" WOW-an eye opening and shocking documentary!
",-0.4574,0.7042,2017-03-13 00:00:00,4,"I really, really, REALLY want to thank Cassie Jay for making this highly thought provoking and provocative film. As someone who believes in freedom of speech with all of their heart, I found the main moral of this film to be astonishing. This is not exactly about a film about how all men are oppressed (although it does greatly delve into areas about oppression against males, as well as reactions to this from both sides of the issue), but more about how we should listen to other's beliefs. Cassie Jay encourages the kindness and debate that the MRAs manage to express throughout the film, rather than the radical silencing of many modern, self proclaimed ""feminists"". Of course, many who have been practically brainwashed by the overly biased modern media will likely hate this film because they have heard about women being oppressed over and over again, and never men being oppressed, when it is true that actually both genders are oppressed, just in different ways. The segment in which Jay shows us how men are SO MUCH less likely to have custody of their children after a divorce is tear jerking, and provides the viewer with an eye opening glimpse into the little talked about ""reverse sexism"" that does indeed exist. The film makes a truly convincing argument, as it tells many tragic stories of fathers who were given little to no say in their custody battles. This explodes into great mountains of melancholy that will be ignored by the leftist media because it just isn't PC enough to feel bad for those who must suffer if they are of a specific gender. And most of my views ARE leftist views...I just don't believe in the stupidity that so many modern leftists like to spew now!However, there is no need for me to just go on a political tangent while reviewing a film. And, as a film, ""The Red Pill"" is still excellent. It does not completely ignore the other side, although it has a blatant slant towards support of men's rights, and the film allows others to make opposing points, many of which are also quite valid. It is also important to remember than filmmaker Cassie Jay is not some hardcore right wing Ann Coulter wannabe. She is a genuinely sweet person who cares about others' rights, and was originally very feminist and has had unpleasant, misogynistic experiences in the past. It is important to realize that the whole point of this movie is to be tolerant of others, no matter what the world around you says. It plays out like a gripping, real life drama, as she questions her own beliefs and learns about the lack of civility and desire for equality that the modern PC movement truly has."
" Best documentary ever

The way she filmed it was great and showing her own thoughts and video diaries made me respect her even more. 10/10! I'm a red pill person myself thanks to my partner who opened up my eyes. I therefore no longer call myself a feminist. Truthfully I despise them and am ashamed to call myself a woman because of this. Of course, not all feminists are 'crazy' like the 'loud red head' shown in this documentary but I can see why men need their own activity or group to be seen. I have studied and read about the same problem she has when it comes to paternity, domestic violence issues and everything else so like her, I was shocked to see that feminist or media hasn't brought up this kind of problems. When men die they are 'persons' but when women die it's a complete disaster which I find odd and disturbing. I really got more and more information about the situation from this documentary and plan to show it, or at least recommend it to everyone I know. I believe everyone, whatever side you're on, should see this."

" Pure Propaganda.
",-0.25,-0.9785,2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"So, essentially, Cassie Jaye is to feminism what Alan Colmes is to leftism.For the uninitiated, The Red Pill (TRP) is a subreddit on Reddit that purports to promote something called men's rights activism (MRA). The name comes from The Matrix, with the red pill representing painful, brutal reality, whereas the blue pill represents the blissful ignorance. For TRP, the normies have taken the blue pill while the red pillers are the ones who face the ugly truth head on. Quite how that manifests itself isn't really clear, though generally it seems the key is lifting weights and trying to pull as many women as possible. Or at least posting on an internet message board about doing such things. Some claim MRAs, TRP and MGTOW (Men who Go Their Own Way) should be treated as entirely separated entities, but in reality they're all basically branches from the same tree.Cassie Jaye is a self-proclaimed ex-feminist, though it's not exactly clear how active she was in feminism or whether she had any genuine understanding or involvement in feminism. There is a brief segment of how she made video diaries about how long it took her to get dressed and how she attended feminist rallies but there's no actual evidence of any feminist activism that she might have partaken in. We see a lot of Jaye. She's in front of the camera for most of the film despite the fact she barely offers anything to the debate beyond vague platitudes. Occasionally, she offers a meek counterpoint and then poses that to the interviewees for an unchallenged rebuttal, but that's about it, and even these counterpoints disappear quickly after the first part of the film, after her totally organic on-screen epiphany. We see a lot of her video diaries too. These would be relevant if the story was really about the genuine journey of a hardcore feminist meeting and challenging both the men she opposes and her own views, but because of Jaye's robotic and passionless presentation, they just come across as entirely vacuous and unnecessary. Even when she cries in one of her entries, the result is entirely melodramatic and self- serving.Jaye says that she feels 'duped' by the MRA's incredibly strong and overwhelming pitch, even though it seemingly entirely consists of a bunch of bearded dudes sitting around in nice houses whining about how discriminated against they are because of feminazis, using posters and flipcharts while the director sits as far away from the man as possible, which is probably a wise choice in fairness.After said epiphany, the film basically descends into full-blown propaganda. A few issues are sporadically focused upon though they aren't really given any serious attention or consideration though, and are all presented only to serve the overriding message that men are hard done by, because of women. We also get to meet women involved in MRA, just to show that it's not really a bunch of moaning men blathering on about a range of disparate and unfocused issues. Honest. The opponents of the MRA movement are portrayed as rabid and irrational thugs who will stop at no end to aggressively stop their more reasoned counterparts, even if they have to take civility and free speech down with them. Feminists in this film are either cartoon caricatures shouting angrily and incoherently, or else cardboard cut-out intellectuals who have no concept of the real world.It's not that there aren't legitimate issues that men face that ought to be addressed. The main problem is that feminism came from a position of genuine recognition of inequality. Some woman, and indeed some men, saw that women were not treated equally in many areas and sought to rectify that, and continue to do so. The MRAs have started from a position of being against feminism, and worked to find issues to complain about to back that position up. It's also intertwined with politics. Feminists have traditionally been of and from the left. It's doubtless that part of the opposition to feminism is political, it's an opposition to the left as much as it as a promotion of men's rights. See how many MRAs you can find who are left-wing. They don't actually care about the issues that purport to fight for, they don't actually even fight for them for the most part, and they only talk about them in an attempt to score points. Ironically, feminism does far more to address the issues that they talk about, and has been doing so for a long time.As for the film, the production values are generally mediocre; the score is particularly bad and occasionally quite distracting. The sound mixing and editing in general is pretty poor and even some of the camera-work is pretty shoddy and the narration is robotic at times and entirely uninteresting or else adds nothing to the debate, and in general, the documentary is horribly presented. The whole film is pure propaganda. It's probably worth remembering that, despite the postulation that this is an entirely unbiased look at the MRA movement, it was predominantly funded on Kickstarter using donations from MRAs.All of this is a great shame as it might actually have been interesting to see a real documentary about the MRAs, to see how they arrived to the movement and to see their views actually challenged in a genuine way. This is a completely wasted opportunity to make an interesting documentary, though as propaganda, Goebbels would have been proud to make such a film."

Articulating the entire platform of the MRM is like trying to understand a snow drift ""one snowflake at a time."" The issues are extremely complicated and often interconnected and that's without delving into the history of chivalric and feminist bias against men. Given the breadth and depth of the issues at hand, I have to commend how well the issues were articulated in only two hours.

I became aware of the Men's Rights Movement (via avoiceformen.com) in late 2011 - participating actively there for several years: commenting often and writing a few pieces that Paul Elam published on the site.A most remarkable thing about documentary creator, Cassie Jaye, is that she is a young women who boldly went where most of her Feminist sisters will never go...to their ideological opposition. Even more radical, was HOW she went: NOT screaming, NOT blockading, and NOT making threats of violence, but rather, with a willingness to listen. To learn. And to reconsider, even jettison, intellectual inconsistencies, without regard for the personal paradigm-shifts such honesty can bring...Based upon my experience, both in the world of the Men's Rights' Movement and in watching this film about it, I can guarantee 100% that you will learn something unique and valuable. And because I believe this so strongly, I'm very confident that if you watch it with an open mind (and heart) - intuitively grasping the significance - you will become a better person for having done so.

This is a documentary done right, and it's engaging enough to hold your attention while being factual enough to be informative.The film is billed as a journey by the filmmaker. She's challenging her preconceived notions and taking on new ideas. I was quite intriguing to see her journey. I think it's a journey many people can relate to."
" The Most Important Movie You'll Ever See(Women Included)
",0.2716,-0.3453,2017-02-03 00:00:00,10,"Yet another subject,addressing another aspect,of America's polarization? After decades of overwhelming feminism(and vicious hypergamy)this country(and others)has suffered,fearless Cassie Jaye tackles topics that can potentially worsen(if that's possible)or dismantle male/female relationships like never before.The feminization of boys.The alienation of fathers.The unfair court rulings.The growing plague of unwed mothers.The delinquent teens this creates.The fact that only a handful of women can admit this out-of-balance view.The denial of truth recognition and how it results in the childish,emotional feminist outbreaks.The assessment of the male condition is one that has been avoided.Like a cancer,it has only festered through it's neglect.It's gone from acceptable,to uncomfortable,to genuinely taboo.And as a result of this taboo status this avoidance is a sign that if it cannot even be looked at,it just might signal the degree of it's significance."
" It should be shown in every school, even I know it will be a very long time before this might happen.
",0.0,0.9115,2017-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Finally got my copy of the movie ""The Red Pill"" :) And really: Everybody should see it! It's a really good documentary where everybody gets their say and nobody is bashed and facts are checked. The viewer can learn something and make up their own mind. It should be shown in every school, even I know it will be a very long time before this might happen. I expect that decades from now we will look back at the woman who got into gender issues because as a teen-actress she was always cast as ""the blond that dies"". Then she became an award winning feminist documentary filmmaker. And then at only 28, made the groundbreaking movie that triggered the changed in the mainstream gender-discussion from blaming and silencing to an actually equal dialog that made the world a better place."
" Deeply personal
",0.0,0.9409,2017-01-29 00:00:00,10,"I just finished watching The Red Pill for the fourth time. I hosted a screening of the film at a local theater the first time, showed it to my friends for my second viewing and watched it alone the last two times. I was nervous about watching it the first two times because I was in essence showing it to people, and it was very overwhelming seeing all of it on the big screen with so many of my friends, finally sharing with them what matters to me and what I'm passionate about. I thought and my friends have told me that it was really effective at introducing men's issues to people who might not have heard of it before, helping them understand both the depth and the scope of many issues as well as humanize many of the men's activists who have been so maligned by the media.It wasn't until my third viewing that I was brought to tears, watching it alone, when Fred Hayward was playing guitar to his son after we found out that he wouldn't see his son again. I think that is an example of what a good film does, you see and feel different things upon different viewings. I started to notice how subtle many of the ways Cassie conveyed the ideas to the audience, for example contrasting the jumping and cheering of people at a feminist event to the shouting of curses and harassment at police officers and attendees of Warren Farrell's talk when she wanted to make the point that we happily let women's issues be heard from the rooftops but shame and silence those who bring light to men's issues.I started looking at men's issues around the same time Cassie started making this documentary, I was at one of the events in the film and many of the people in the film have become not just my heroes, but my friends. So I am biased, because this is a very personal film to me, but I believe this is one of the most important documentaries ever made, and agree with someone who said that Cassie will go down as one of the most influential person in history in the centuries to come."
" A Must-Watch Regardless Of Which Side You're On
",0.0,0.4968,2017-01-28 00:00:00,9,"As a Kickstarter backer, I received a pre-release digital copy. Overall, the documentary is nothing short of amazing. I follow the issues presented in the film with some regularity and I am the type of person who will seek out opinions of those I disagree with to learn where they're coming from. I feel that this is exactly what Cassie Jaye did in her film. She allowed both sides to make their arguments without putting in her own spin or bias...a rarity with documentary film makers and a very welcome surprise. Although I was already familiar with many of the issues presented, I still felt the heartbreak of some of the personal stories shared. For the uninitiated, some revelations will come as a shock. Imagine centuries ago when people thought the Earth was flat and the outrage that ensued when told it is actually round...in that time you were called a ""heretic"" or ""blasphemer"" for speaking truth to power while today it's overused terms like ""misogynist"" and ""hate speech"".One small criticism I would have is that you could tell there is so much more to the stories presented but with the constraints of fitting everything into a 2 hour film, it is understandable that cuts and edits were done where they were. What I would advise anyone watching this documentary to do is to check out some of the interviews with Cassie Jaye (Youtube channels like The Rubin Report, Stefan Molyneux, etc.) and Q&A sessions done during the screenings of this film (can easily be found on Youtube by searching ""The Red Pill Q&A"") where you'll get to go a little deeper and more in-depth explanations on what both sides, the feminists and men's rights activists, believe and fight for. I can only hope that the special features included on DVD/Blu-Ray will fill in some of the minor gaps with more interview footage.One of the most interesting things about this documentary is seeing filmmaker Cassie Jaye's personal struggle with having her feminist beliefs challenged through her video diaries which pop up here and there throughout the documentary. You can tell that she was genuinely having a hard time coping with having all of these statistics thrown at her that disprove what she believed in. At the end of it all, this is what makes this documentary more compelling, even more so than the heartbreaking stories and reality-shattering statistics from the men's rights activists.If you're a feminist or simply believe women in the West don't get a fair shake compared to men, you owe it to yourself to have your views challenged and see if they stand up to scrutiny. What have you to lose? Your convictions will either be strengthened or you will come to terms with the fact that your beliefs were wrong and can take comfort in knowing that you now have the truth. Whether or not your beliefs remain the same, one thing is certain...you will be changed in some way.Like Morpheus says to Neo in ""The Matrix"": I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth..."
" Worth the wait
",0.2263,0.99,2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"I first found out about this project several years ago, even before Milo put out a call to help Cassie get funding. It's been a long, almost agonizing wait, but boy was it worth it.Cassie Jaye is an excellent documentarian. She gives both sides a chance to make their case and doesn't interfere. She does, however, keep a video diary of her experience making the film, and watching her journey and evolution through a series of diary entries is just as compelling as anything else in the movie. It was a good decision to do this.Her cameras capture moments of every hue and shade, from maddening and frustrating to deeply touching. Very compelling stuff.If I had to pick a favorite moment, I would be torn between two. Karen Straughan at around the 1:41:00 mark, where with exquisite timing and razor sharp logic she delivers a coup de grace like only she can. It's the summary of a video she did a few years back, and her point is just as compelling now as then.The other candidate would be the very last line of the movie, delivered by Cassie Jaye herself.Thank you, Cassie, for having an open mind and dealing with some cognitive dissonance. I think men all over the Western world are going to owe you a debt of gratitude. This means a lot, and the documentary was fully as superb and entertaining as it deserved to be. God bless."
" A tremendous effort
",0.0,0.9816,2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"I just watched the movie on the day it was made available to Kickstarter Backers like myself right after I came home from work, and what an emotional roller-coaster ride it is! I've been aware of the Men's Right Movement and all the other Red Pill movements for several years now, though I don't follow any of them regularly anymore, so very little in the movie was new to me, but that's fine since this documentary doesn't require any prior knowledge. What I can say is that it gave an excellent representation of the movement, there's hardly anything I've missed sans the co-opting of feminism by Marxism pretty much since its inception, though that would probably have been too advanced since you would have to explain Marxism, the Frankfurt School and Critical Theory in order to do that, which would be a great documentary on its own. There was a hint of it though, it was mentioned that the women's movement shifted the main blame from capitalism to patriarchy early on, so kudos to that.I've known all about the harrowing cases of injustices men face in the justice system and the themes of male disposability, men as victims of domestic and sexual violence (though boys being sexually abused by women are hardly mentioned at all, she should have included more here) and male paternal rights, yet watching these made me as mad as I had been hearing about them the first time.The most harrowing thing she showed were the screams of a baby boy being circumcized, and I can't thank Cassie Jaye enough for being courageous enough to include these in the movie, anyone talking down the horrors of male genital mutilation after watching this deserves to rot in hell (female being equally horrific, but far more stigmatized, and it's great that it's as stigmatized as it is).Also mentioned towards the end, and again I can't thank Cassie enough, is how feminists have fought any progress on men's rights whatsoever even in the most egregious, barbaric cases and continue to do so, though this could have been expanded on more.It also raised the question of why feminists and MRAs aren't working together, and besides the aforementioned stonewalling from feminists (and the not mentioned Marxist nature of the feminist movement) the great Karen Straughan weighs in on this with her trademark analytic brilliance.The MRAs featured in the movie all did a great job of presenting their case, the only one I missed was Janet Bloomfied, though maybe her supreme Shitlord qualities might have been a little too much for some.What surprised me was that Chanty Binx alias ""Big Red"" actually comes off better here than I've expected, actually spouting some half truths mixed in with the Marxism. She and two other prominent feminists are featured and they get to make their case, though they weren't shown being asked any tough questions.All in all Cassie absolutely kept her promise of giving the Men's Rights Movement a fair shake, which I was skeptical of until I saw the movie. This movie is also about her personal journey being a feminist making a movie about the MRM, and from reading other reviews I had been afraid that the movie could be too much about her and to little about the subject matter, but this is absolutely not the case, the way she handled this was perfect, I can't praise Cassie enough for this or for the movie!"
" World-Changer
",0.0,0.9698,2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"It follows the life of a feminist as she films an exposé on the much-reviled Men's Rights Movement, only to discover something very unexpected about herself. I was amazed that the audience could be taken on such a deep journey in only 2 hours. Superb editing combined with poignant music and gut-wrenching subject matter put it over the top. It's also visually beautiful, and there are so many camera angles, you feel like you're everywhere at once. Even though I had already heard all the points raised in the film many times before, I was still in tears by the time the credits rolled. It's powerful filmmaking. It was banned in Melbourne, so you know it can hit a nerve. The Red Pill is eligible for an Academy Award, and surely deserves one. This movie will change the course of history."
" Feminism meets the Men's Movement
",0.0,0.9719,2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"I've been working with men and women who love them for more than 40 years. I believe in the rights of women as well as the rights of men and feel that both sides of this debate of ""women's liberation"" and ""men's rights"" have been polarized unnecessarily. I think we need to come together and find common ground as men and women. The Red Pill film is masterful in seeing a woman, an avowed feminist, go deeply into the men's rights and father's rights movements to find the humanity behind the headlines.The film is not only extremely well done and entertaining. It is a landmark opportunity for all those who care about the future of the men's movement and the women's movement, and just the human movement, to come together and heal.The film is truthful and courageous and everyone, regardless of your point of view, will find it will change your perceptions, open your heart and mind."
" The Red Pill is just perfect
",0.5719,0.948,2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,In case you wonder how I can rate and comment before the actual release: As a KickStarter backer I have a prerelease copy and did actually see the film before writing this comment. Like most KickStarter backer I wanted that Cassie Jaye can finish the film without interference from any involved groups so she can create an unbiased and fair documentary. That was also the only promise she made to the backer.And I have to say I am very pleased with the result. I loved how Cassie Jaye let all her interview partner talk without undo interruption giving then every chance to make there point or talk themselves into oblivion – as some did.
