" A worthy feministic sports drama
",0.4404,0.9217,2021-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Since Chak De India, Paan Singh Tomar, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Mukkabaaz and Mary Kom, Dangal has easily joined the list of classic sports drama.The direction by Nitesh Tiwari has everything in the right place. The songs are well put and emotional. The two girls gave a fitting performance. But in all, Aamir Khan was one of the major pull of the movie who gave his best performance of life. He truly stole the show."

" Not worth watching
",-0.1695,-0.296,2020-12-04 00:00:00,1,Avoid this movie. This movie doesn't teach us anything.
" As a Top 5 rated movie from 2016, it really underdelievred
",0.2023,0.7293,2020-11-27 00:00:00,4,"I would rate the movie as follows1. Characters 5 - all characters are pretty clich√©e, don't have much depth and are not really interesting. Girls who become wrestlers and confident, a father who is positively surprised by his daughters having wrestling talent and a concerned mother, that's all that is interesting and that is not much2. Acting 4 - the acting is also pretty flat and the fights are pretend fighting and are super boring3. Plot 4 - the plot is very boring and has zero twists4. Cinematography 8 - the cinematography is nice, but also nothing overwhelming"
" Feels so bloated and forced that it hampers the, admittedly noteworthy, hearty narrative
",-0.5046,0.9534,2020-11-19 00:00:00,6,"Too long, too predictable and too slow.After the 161 minutes were over, I didn't hold anything majorly negative about 'Dangal' as it does improve as it goes on. However, the first chunk of this film is yawnful, with the story falling to initially inspire - just a guide on how to be a bad parent, in anything. The ending is also pretty cartoonish, with the broom cupboard stuff.The cast performances are, in fairness, very good. Aamir Khan does great as Mahavir, while Fatima Sana Shaikh (and Zaira Wasim) are impressive as Geeta. Sanya Malhotra (and Suhani Bhatnagar) deserve praise also.With that noted, It isn't really anything all that fresh for Bollywood sport biopics either. It follows similar beats to 2014's 'Mary Kom' and 2015's 'Brothers'... even 2011's 'Patiala House'.For me, this 2016 production just feels so bloated and forced that it hampers the, admittedly noteworthy, hearty narrative. The leads are the only strong points to it in my opinion. It has been very highly received by others, so what do I know? Opinions and all that."
" Just another of those supposedly motivational movies.
",0.0,-0.3812,2020-11-17 00:00:00,3,"I believe this film teaches us wrong things. Basicly, the father forces his daughters to do his dream, to win a gold medal for a country, because he himself wasn't good enough to do it himself. Secondly, supposedly even silver is not good enough for the father. What kind of father is that, he's lucky his daughters are cable of all that but with all this he could've not only mentally damages both of his daughters but ruin their life too. He gave them no free will of what they want from life, he forced them to live their whole lives how he wanted them to be."

" Nice biographical sports drama
",0.4215,0.9888,2020-11-05 00:00:00,6,"Aamir Khan plays Mahavir Singh Phogat, a former amateur wrestler, who decides to train his two daughters to become world class wrestlers. Based on true events and real people, the story plays out through the girls' childhood and culminates in the Commonwealth Games of 2010.The story is told nicely. We start with Mahavir at this prime and slowly watch him lose his edge, becoming more and more desperate for a legacy of any kind. And when he finds it in his two oldest daughters, it's a nice moment. The movie is also a great spokesperson for equality between genders and overall tolerance.It's also nice to watch a Bollywood film without constant singing and dancing. A nice change of pace.That being said, the film is long. It's so long. At over two and half hours long it definitely manages to overstay its welcome. Especially as a sports drama, which are usually on the shorter end of spectrum.The movie also starts to focus more on the older of the two daughters, Greeta (Fatima Sana Shaikh), even though her younger sister, Babita (Sanya Malhotra), has just about as much claim to fame and glory as she does. They even competed in much of the same tournaments, albeit at different weight classes, which is not always apparent in the film.Still, Dangal is definitely worth a watch if you're looking for a good sports drama and/or you've been looking for a Bollywood film that does not take its cues from a Disney musical."

With breathtaking performances all round, this is one film that will leave you in awe of the incredible things people can achieve in the most challenging of circumstances - an absolutely astonishing piece of film making."
" Another good Aamir Khan film. Never fails to disappoint.

The wrestling matches were very well made, felt like i was watching it live and never felt like I 'knew' what was about to happen (though I did). Great themes throughout too of family and culture in India."
" Excellent Movie
",0.5719,0.9842,2020-09-30 00:00:00,10,"If you think Dangal is another textbook biography flick, I reckon you will be surprised with the entire flick from head to the toe. Dangal is a masterpiece and well-directed movie. Nearly perfect story line, without any doubt. Every cast played their roles naturally, especially Aamir Khan. I have watched an array of his previous movies but Dangal demonstrates his masterclass. In addition, credit should be given to all of the casts for the eminent acting. Granted, there are no typical love scenes, no unnecessary scenes and no visible technical non-senses. The time line was crystal clear. At 160 minutes, this film is fairly long. However, the background music and soundtracks were absolute stellar to uplift the ambiance of this movie. Overall, this flick is such an inspirational and elevating especially to drive our motivation to clinch the success. Highly recommended"
" QUALITY MATTERS!
",0.1007,0.7949,2020-09-28 00:00:00,5,"It is loosely based biography of Phogat sisters. The portrayal is average, felt like restricted. The characters are very pessimistic. I didn't like few things -- 1. Does a father incites his daughter to be aggressive? He should teach them primarily about the spirit of sportsmanship apart from training. That is absent from the movie. Instead he seems very obsessed about gold in Olympics.2. Amir is shown to be very dominant towards his family and also sometimes to neighbours. He is very unsentimental towards his family. Is this genuine?? This attitude will lead to winning and that is questionable. This points to ingenuine biopic. Felt like distorting the truth. If not then direction is flawed heavily.3. His daughters seem to be non interested in wrestling. They all did it out of pressure whether mental or physical. Does it seem real. It should have been depicted in a different manner, if it isn't that point.The quality of movies is seen by two points - Content and technicals. Content here is flawed and technicals are so so. An average rating of 5 or 6 is the best.8.4/10 is a quantitative judgement not a qualitative one. Indian viewers must understand the quality of movies prior rating it at high. I mean from 1,49000 votes bought 8.4? I mean there are so many educated people out there who thinks. Do a favour and keep Indian movie mindset at high. Ultimately it is the quality that matters."
" A breathtaking experience
",0.4588,0.9804,2020-09-23 00:00:00,10,"I rarely give a movie a 10 , unless it truly touches elemental feelings inside my heart. This movie gives you every emotion that you could think of: joy, sadness, sympathy, curiosity, expectation, excitement, suspense,... If you watched '3 idiots' also featuring Aamir Khan, you will probably expect this movie to be on the same level. And let me tell you, you will not be disappointed. What left a footprint in my mind is that they made the deciding moment so epic because it felt like those moments in Hollywood movies where a certain detail from a previous scene suddenly rises to the rescue. I could not think that kind of moment would appear in a movie like this. And girl power is so beautifully and naturally depicted that all the so-called women empowerment themed Hollywood movies would have to take off their hats. 100% recommended!"

" Dangal is unmissable.
",0.0,0.9947,2020-09-08 00:00:00,9,"Dangal review :In his 2001 Oscar nominated 'Lagaan', Aamir Khan had hit a six off last ball to win the match. In 2016, his latest release 'Dangal' hits the much needed six off the last week to rescue bollywood from its long dry spell. Dangal is a triumph not just for Khan but for Bollywood itself. Trust me, I've not seen a biopic which balances realism and entertainment so fantastically and intentionally avoids undue glorification of its lead.Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan), a national level wrestler from small town in Haryana, aspires to win gold for India but is forced to take up job to fend for his family. He wants a son to be able to fulfil his ambition but God blesses him with four daughters. Distraught and dejected Mahavir Singh realises he can still achieve his dream through his two daughters Geeta (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Sanya Malhotra) who inherit his genes. ""Mhari choriyan choron se kam hai ke"", he questions his submissive wife (Sakshi Tanwar).Next, Mahavir Singh almost turns tyrannical by imposing strict diet regime and strenous training on his kid daughters. At one point, he even gets their tresses chopped off. At this juncture, I actually wondered if his stubborn actions were justified at all and whether a parent should impose his unfulfilled ambitions on his child and subject him/her to such extreme stress. That's the beauty of Dangal - it makes you ponder at the situations even as it entertains.The next scene involving an underage girl being married off against her wish to live a life burning 'choola' and bearing children drives the pertinent point of the need for female empowerment in rural India. It also makes the Phogat sisters realise the quantum of dedication and perseverance of their father to give them an identity of their own in such a feudal society even while he is braving the growing resistance and taunts from the neighbourhood.Co- writer and director Nitesh Tiwari springs a surprise after his okey dokey kiddo film 'Chillar Party' (2011) and just about bearable 'Bhootnath Returns' (2014). Dangal is a giant leap for him in terms of story telling as well as technique. Dialogues are brilliant and the haryanvi accent doesn't jar at all. The production quality is expectedly top class. The background score complements the movie perfectly.On the flipside, the film could've been crisper in the second half. A locked door playing villain in the climax appears to be a cinematic liberty...but I'll choose to ignore these few inconsistencies as they don't hamper the big picture and it's strong inspiring message.That perfectionist Aamir Khan had worked hard on his physique for this movie is well known. But the amount of intensity he lends to his real life character which ages from a lean muscular wrestler to a hapless paunchy father is highly commendable.The supporting cast is pitch perfect. Sakshi Tanwar delivers a restrained yet effective performance. Newcomers Fatima and Sanya leave a lasting impression. Marathi actor Girish Kulkarni gets a meaty role and nails it.All in all, Dangal is simply unmissable. Do yourself a favour by watching it today.Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni"

",0.34,0.9052,2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,"Dangal is a movie set in a conservative part of India where women's only purpose is having babies and cooking. But a family breaks this norm by engaging the daughters in wrestling(kushti). This movie is based on the Phogat sisters.A stellar performance by Aamir Khan, playing the father of Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat. Equally convincing was the role of Fatima S Shaikh as Geeta Phogat.During the whole duration of the movie, never did i feel out of sync as i was completely immersed in the biography. There were many scenes where the characters connected with the viewers. Be it the daughter crying in front of her father after losing or the father feeling proud after she wins; the film touches your heart.Even though one is aware about the life of Geeta and Babita Phogat, this movie is a must watch because there are a lot of life lessons to take home."

After seeing his introduction of fattening and losing weight for the film, he has more admiration than admiration.

" It's not easy to choose.
",-0.3412,0.9921,2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,"In the movie, Geeta, the eldest daughter, trains with her father and plays for the first time. Four boys lined up, some thin, some sturdy, and Geeta chose. Of course, everyone in the audience believed that even the weakest boy could beat the Geeta girl. But Geeta chose his strongest rival.Like all the wrestling scenes in the show, the fight that followed was real and exciting. Opponents at first disdain, suffered a loss, soon learned to handle with caution. Geeta was focused, trying to seize every opportunity. The audience also from the relaxed mood of watching the play, become nervous and engaged. Geeta lost to his opponent but won the respect of the crowd. But she was disappointed. Her father said she had conquered her fear.Geeta had lived passively under his father's demon training. Even if we agree ideologically with our father, we can't get a glimpse of Geeta's true character. But this simple choice on the field brought Geeta's character to light. As my father later concluded, Geeta was an aggressive tiger. This domineering choice was the best preparation for Geeta's fate. Even if the opponent is bigger, even if Geeta is lost, we also know that this girl's heart sleeps a fierce tiger.Choice is an exam question.Let's think about another girl. She lived in developed Europe and America and loved wrestling since childhood. With the support of her parents, she met the best coach and successfully won the Olympic championship. In such a life, the dream is like the lamp, no longer need to choose the trouble. Just such a film is made out, at most is a youth inspirational fairy tale: sweet but difficult to shock people. This is not to say that there are no plain sailing people. It is only in the face of difficult choices that human nature is often fully manifested. Moviegoers are willing to sit in front of the screen for two or three hours, expecting to see the true humanity of the choices.Because of the choice of time and often, the character of the character becomes three-dimensional. The father is stubborn and conceited, but when he massages his daughter's ankles, he questions his own harshness. Even when he had chosen the road for his daughter, he had added a year's time to his worries. When the professional coach humiliates in front of him, his father, who always refuses to admit defeat, takes it in his face. But when the daughter sobbed on the other end of the phone, the father did not hesitate, the next day to the daughter's city, quietly for his daughter as a practice partner. Throughout the film, amir khan, who plays the father, is unsmiling and has the same serious expression that many fathers do. But these choices, and the hesitancy and determination of his choices, gave me a sense of the richness of this father.Geeta's success comes with a string of choices. After becoming a national champion, she opted for a more professional-looking coach, abandoning her father's skills. More importantly, she also gave up her focus on wrestling. In subsequent international competitions, Geeta did poorly. Meanwhile, the director deliberately accentuates the scene of Babita, the second daughter, and seems to want to abandon Geeta and turn Babita into a champion hero. In the difficult situation, Geeta chose to let go of her strong self-esteem and retrain according to her father's method. In the last moment of her father's absence, she chose to grow up alone, with a beautiful rainbow to win the gold medal, completed the transformation of an independent woman.Some film critics argue that a father pushing his daughter to train violates ""women's rights"". Yet women's rights have always been more than a slogan that can be easily uttered. The feminist movement in Europe and the United States began at the end of the 19th century. In the hard, dirty and dangerous textile workshops, working women have a choice to make: be content with what they earn, or fight for more women's rights. As reflected in suffragette, the hard-won right to vote for women was paid a heavy price by the feminist movement. Similarly, in post-world war ii America, when men returned from the war, women in military factories faced the dilemma of returning to their families or staying at work. After years of hesitation, American women have chosen to fight for women's rights. Women's rights meant accepting the ""choice"" test, not the easy life.Similarly, in India and many other developing countries, women's social status is low. Even if the most outstanding people to cry, it is difficult to change the traditional strong inertia. In the face of difficult choices, there is no way to have it both ways. It is true that the father forced his daughter at first. But as the father proudly declared, ""let the daughter be strong enough to choose her husband"". That's what makes movies valuable. It makes no secret of the cruelty of reality, whether it is early marriage, paternity, bureaucracy, or even the intensity and danger of wrestling itself. But for all the social problems, the film also holds a brave heart to choose. Father and daughter choose, act, then from humble beginning, until their own goal.Before the screen, we can also have a choice?"

The best example is this Indian inspirational film, which can make you excited and excited even if you don't watch sports. It can make the ordinary family become warm blood, vivid; It also allows you to see a lot of the problems that society has right now."
" I am proud of you
",0.4767,-0.9711,2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"The movie is adapted from a real story, perhaps placed in our reality, such a straight male cancer father will be vomited: You can't accomplish your dreams, why do you impose on your daughter? But that was in India. In that country, women were destined to marry people when they were 14 years old, and they could only keep giving birth to children and do housework. The father who appeared to be a tyrant imposed his dream on his daughter. In fact, it also forcibly changed their life path destined by this society.
Father's trembling hand sent us to the big world that he had never experienced, and he fully expected everyone to understand us and care for us like himself. How he wanted to put us under his own wings forever, until, until we could reach an impeccable state. But his father was only his father. He had no more abilities. He could only watch his children stumble toward this world full of temptations and traps.
We left the small town at home and came to the so-called big city. We saw more, learned more, and the world of flowers shook us so that we could not open our eyes. The appearance of the so-called friend brings everything you have never seen before, just strange. Gradually, you will lose yourself, thinking that you feel the wind of the world and touch the tip of the world. You disdain everything your father told you, you forgot the rule of being sure when you were young, and you said to your father, ""Your old set is out of date, and no one does that now."" Just like Gita told his father, it is not popular now. Wrestled like this!
We are growing up, and old and new conflicts will eventually occur. Some people say that parental love refers to parting love. They send their children to grow up, and children send them to grow old. For decades in a lifetime, there is only a period of intersection. What should I do when the children are rushing out, and their parents are afraid that they will fall and they will fold their wings? Only anxiety remained.
Gita and his father had a PK on the wrestling field when they were young, which gave me the climax of the whole movie. I clenched my fists tightly, and my tears couldn't stop flowing. I knew that the father needed to lose because of the plot-because the parents never really won their children.
In a wrestling, Gita used the ""pop"" skills taught by the coach to fight against his father's ""old-fashioned"" experience and eventually overwhelmed his father to the ground. What I saw was a battle between a young cheetah-like wrestler and an old wrestler from Maifa, and it was also a conflict between her daughter and her father. Not surprisingly, a young wrestler will win, and her daughter will also win. She flicked her hair and told her father, ""Look, your suit is outdated."" From childhood to the age, he has been trained by the father's devil, and the girl who loves beauty is forcibly cut off her beautiful long hair ... At this moment, she has spent her childhood. Shadow, defeated the mountain-like giant who oppressed herself, she should have a big sigh in her heart. His father was lying in the sand, gray-faced, like an old, bearded black bear. There was no remorse on his face, no anger and anger, just a little bit, so sad and helpless."

It is also in such a social environment that the gold medal won by Gita at the end of the movie is so precious and so bloody. What impressed me most was that the father was locked in the dark room, I prayed silently not to let him out. I don't want to see actress regains the courage to defeat her opponent because of her father's arrival. Such an ending would make the film mediocre. Good thing is that the director didn't let me down. Her ability came from her father, but in the end she learned to fly alone."
" the best indian movie in the history
",0.6369,0.9958,2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016."

" A MUST WATCH !!
",0.0,0.9898,2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"Director Nitesh Tiwari and Bollywood's perfectionist, Aamir Khan's sports drama Dangal is a clear winner despite its imperfections. Aamir Khan's brilliance in transforming into Mahavir Phogat sees him embody the role at every level. While his dedication and hard work is apparent in the the muscular physicality of the initial sequences, the flabby bulk for the rest of the movie and his embracing the mud and grime of the ring and making the strategies and technique utterly convincing, his acting chops shine through in scenes in which he trains his daughters with a steely resolve playing a ruthless, if not cruel, coach, his wholehearted celebration when he sees her triumph at various levels and those silent moments of frustration and helplessness when he sees his daughter losing focus and going astray or even in the final sequences when he struggles to witness the final match.Even as he towers over everyone else, the stellar supporting cast too ace their roles including Sakshi Tanwar as Phogat's wife who supports her husband despite her persisting doubts on the path chosen by him, Ritwik Sahore playing the young cousin Omkar who becomes sparring partner for the girls, Aparshakti Khurana paying the older Omkar who is the narrator, Mahavir's aide and adding to the amusement, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar who play young Geeta and Babita going through the grueling training regime, Fatima Sana Shaikh playing the older Geeta and Sanya Malhotra playing the older Babita. Fatima brings in the required intensity, athleticism, innocence as well as vulnerability in the role which sees her ascent, sense of innocent awe at the glitzy world outside her village, losing focus and finding redemption.One can see that a lot of effort has gone into making the bouts look authentic, yet thrilling at the same time. On the flip side, Dangal is flabby by at least twenty minutes, the characterisation of the national coach is more of a caricaturish villain, it plays to the jingoistic gallery with its anthem adjunct, as well as the contrived climax.Yet, Dangal rises above these niggles, thanks to a star who effaces himself to be the character and sincerity that permeates almost every frame of this venture which makes it a winner.It may not soar high enough to be the epic Olympian gold it seeks to be; Nevertheless, it is an international gold, albeit at CWG, which is well won !!"
" Incredible sports film

I was actually able to predict nearly every part of the ending, and predictable movies usually aren't able to pull an emotional response from me. Dangal was different, making me eagerly await the predicted final scenes, and I was still fighting back tears when the scenes finally came. With that said, the second act did lull by making one of the characters less likable for far too long. Also, I wasn't a fan of the father playing favorites in most of the second half. So it's not a perfect movie, but the first act was pure fun and the third act was powerfully inspiring, and it's surely worth a watch."

" A motivational story about how Indian women obtain self-value and achieve social recognition
",0.0,0.9988,2018-11-16 00:00:00,9,"The film Dangal, starring Aamir Khan, is based on a true story in countryside India. The father was once a successful wrestler but was forced to give up his dream due to financial straits. He hopes that his sons could fulfill his dream but he only has four daughters. However, he discovers the striking talents of wrestling in his two daughters by accident. Then the father trains the daughters strictly and finally they become champions. The inspirational scenes of wrestling in the movie are so amazing that they arouse strong passion among audience. When watching the final scene in which Geeta defeats her opponent in the final round and the national anthem starts for her championship, I got moved because their father's dream is finally fulfilled after various frustrations and Geeta eventually becomes a successful woman with self value, which is contrasted with the traditional female images in India. She experienced a harsh childhood. Her strong ambition as well as masculine appearance always couldn't be understood by people with traditional Hindustani mind. She is also torn between the hardline approaches of her father and the theory-oriented approach by her coach and fell into confusion after she attends the sports academy. But at the time that she wins in the international competition and the national flag rises for her, we could see that fortunately, all her hard work pays off. The status of women in athletic field gains recognition. And that exciting moment also marked that the deep-rooted stereotype that women are destined to depend on their husbands could be alleviated in Indian people's mind. The film emphasizes nationalism and feminism. The patriarchal father definitely loves their daughters deeply, which could be revealed in the wedding scene. In countryside Indian society, women usually don't have any right to fulfill their own dreams, but Geeta's father firmly allows their daughters to challenge the tradition. He believes that his daughters are so excellent that they shouldn't be chosen by men in marriage. Furthermore, I want to say that the actors in the film are all extremely devoted. I hear from the news that Aamir Khan changes his posture rapidly during the shoot of the film in order to fit the appearance of the father in different periods. Also, the wrestling scenes performed by the daughters are amazing. They remind me of the fighting scenes in Deewar(1975) in which Vijay fights against the villains in a warehouse. Both of them succeed in shocking the audience and the win of the protagonist could push the plot into climax. Compared to earlier melodramatic Bollywood films, Dangal appears to be more authentic and convincing. This inspirational story of how women from Indian countryside win wrestling champion step by step could stimulate audience."

" From www.thegby.com
",0.0,0.9728,2018-09-22 00:00:00,9,"We chose Dangal, a biopic about Mahavir Singh Phogat and his daughters, Geeta and Babita. Mahavir (Aamir Khan) is a former wrestler who had to forego his sport to support his family. Even though he is living out his dreams through his children he also gives them a future full of choices. Training also allows them to form a close relationship, which is uncommon in their culture. It is interesting to see the girls learn to appreciate their father as they grow from young girls (Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar) to young women (Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra). As Geeta and Babita begin to embrace their training, they become more confident and competitive. Mahavir endures the taunts of his village and wrestling peers while having continued confidence and pride in his daughters. The matches are exciting and visceral, I felt myself holding my breath. When Geeta begins training with Coach Kadam (Girish Kulkarni) she seems to lose her edge, which returns when she reconnects with her father. The relationship between the father/coach and the National coach demonstrates how small and petty men can be. The original music gives depth to the storyline."

" Beautiful but biased toward Mahavir Singh Phogat
",-0.0516,-0.4649,2018-07-28 00:00:00,5,"On surface this film looks really good, but if you go deep you will find many flaws in the script and the story looks too fake. First thing is Mahavir Singh Phogat's character. The film tries hard to make his character look good. In the scene where Geeta and Babita goes to a friend's marriage and she explains them how their father does right by forcing them to wrestle is completely nonsense. It's a really illogical scene.Now, as a biography it is completely fake. The character of Coach Pramod Kadam was completely fictional. There were seven coaches in National Academy of sports then and no one by the name of Pramod Kadam. There was no such villain in Geeta's real life. And it highly unlikely to believe that the coaches in such a big institute gives wrong training to his students .I always thought as a film it is perfect despite not being true. But, I was proven wrong when I read Baradwaj Rangan's review . (Following are his views on the film ) . I came to know this is highly fairy tale like film. She follows father's advice and won, she neglects him and she lost. In just one day , Mahavir learns that his girls are strong and decides to make them wrestlers. This film has a very few shades of dark. The atmosphere was always like she will win at the end and she did.So, for me it scores neither as a biography nor as a fiction."

With no support from the government, he failed to get an international gold medal for his country but hoped to be redeemed by a son. He is disillusioned after getting four daughters and no sons. Even the Gods have turned against him. Then neighborhood parents complain that Mahavir's daughters Geeta and Babita had beaten up their boys. He is inspired to train them for girls' wrestling.This is based on the real family of wrestlers. As soon as he had the first daughter, it seems obvious where this is going. For an hour, this is a formulaic underdog sports movie. At that point, my main complaints are that it uses way too many montages and I thought cutting the girls' hair is a step too far. It follows the formula well and the characters are appealing. It's a solid sports movie. Then the movie keeps going and going. The darn thing is almost three hours and unlike other Bollywood movies, there are no long song and dance sequences. The story takes another step and the relationships get deeper. There is a fight between father and daughter that is tense and emotional. It takes the movie to a higher level. Even the hair has a nice payoff later on. The wrestling at the end is compelling.

I've religiously watched Bollywood for the past 3 years and I have not seen a movie so balanced with family and sport and female empowerment than this one. Maybe 'Mary Kom' but even that didn't give me the chills that 'Dangal' produced. 
Geeta and Babita stole my heart, especially when they were younger and just embarking on their journey as wrestlers. The most poignant scene, for me, comes when they were still in their youth, learning a lesson of gratitude that they were blind to before. 
Indian films, in general, make you more aware of how important family is and after watching this it made me think of things differently that my mom had done to me when I was younger, all in the desire to make me a stronger woman. I love this movie so much for that message, the message that a woman can be just as strong, if not stronger, than any man or foe she is against. 
I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so just go watch the movie and realize for yourself how amazing it truly is."

Former wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) discovers that his two daughters have a natural skill in grappling as they beat up two boys who were teasing them.So he decides to train them as wrestlers and enter them into wrestling competitions where they have to fight others boys as competition for girls did not exist. In the face of ridicule his daughters impress the onlookers with their strength and skill.Dangal inspired by films such as Rocky and The Karate Kid have training montages set to music, a stern father who coaches them to a strict rigorous schedule. The father then loses his daughters to a national coach who trains the daughters for international competitions but gets the girls to unlearn what their father has taught them which causes a crisis of confidence.The film has good performances from actresses Fatima Sana Shaikh (Geeta Phogat) and Sanya Malhotra (Babita) who looks to have done a lot of intense training for their roles. Aamir Khan's character is too one-note with very little shade to his performance and I think the film suffers as a result along with the long running time which is par for the course with Hindi films.This is an inspiring film of the rise of female wrestling in a patriarchal society as the now young women enter the Commonwealth Games in Delhi and go for gold with their father helping them from the sidelines much to the irritation of the Indian team coach.

From the beginning to the end, we were kept entertained, and had many a laughter and jokes to share. My girlfriend's from China whilst I am from Singapore, but the context was still all so endearing. I believe any viewers would be able to get the humour and heartwarming story behind it all. I usually hate the word heartwarming as most movies of that genre disgust me. But this was a pleasant kind. The actor and actresses had so much chemistry and were stellar! The action was not Michael Bay certified but definitely kept me going ""WHOAAA DAYUMM!"" Definitely worth your time. The only reason I did not give it a 10/10 overall was because I felt that the older actresses did not portray the same feelings as their respective child actors, although most people would fail to notice!"
" A unique father with unique daughters
",0.0,0.9944,2018-03-24 00:00:00,9,"Looking out to watch this blockbuster hit for a long time, I got my chance only a few weeks back. I had faith that Aamir Khan, the certified perfectionist would definitely do a flawless job. We have seen many father characters on screen showering their love on their daughters. But the love and adoration shown here is distinctively exemplary. As the movie starts, we get the feeling that the father Mahavir Singh (Aamir Khan) is imposing his desires on his daughters. But as the movie progressed, I started wishing that girls get such supportive fathers who are dedicated to bringing out the best in their daughters and show them to the world. The daughters, both younger and older versions have given a splendid performance. The younger girls portrayed a naive appearance in the beginning that we wonder how the transformation to heavyweight wrestlers was possible. But I realized that putting on weight to become hefty is not necessary, just a tremendous amount of stamina and willpower. The wrestling scenes have been worked in good detail. More that being a sports movie, this movie spells of female empowerment in the real sense and the forward thinking of a father that a girl's life should not be spent in the kitchen alone. Hats off to the real Mahavir Singh, Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat for being such grand role models."

" ""You have to fight in a way that people remember you.""
",-0.3818,0.9129,2018-03-04 00:00:00,7,"Most of the reviewers for this film here on IMDb appear to be folks of Indian background; nothing wrong with that but with most of them offering glowing praise and a '10 rating, it's difficult to get a true perspective on the movie. I thought it was OK, though not a '10' rated film by any means. The picture utilizes a tried and true sports movie formula depicting a rigorous training schedule, a demanding coach and notable accomplishments along the way before the principal character encounters some roadblocks on the way to a Commonwealth Games gold medal. There's also the idea of success achieved by defying conventional thinking, in the way Geeta Phogat (Fatima Sana Shaikh) and her sister Babita (Sanya Malhotra) rise to prominence in the traditionally male sport of wrestling. That's perhaps the film's best takeaway, as the girls in question endured a lot of physical and mental anguish to achieve their goals, thereby serving as role models for other young women to follow.I couldn't help thinking however, that if the setting for this film was present day America, the father (Aamir Khan) might never have gotten past the first month of training his daughters because someone would have turned him in for child abuse. Cutting the girls' hair and restricting their diet would have gotten someone to notice, and Mahavir slapping his young nephew Omkar for some slight was totally uncalled for. It might not have appeared so bad if the man had lightened up his approach from time to time but his expression was always so grim it looked like he was mad at the world. One could say that his style eventually paid off in the end, but the emotional toll on his daughters, especially Geeta, could have been avoided with a more 'fatherly' approach. The one American film this most reminded me of was 1984's ""The Karate Kid"", but without a bully opponent and with national prestige at stake in the tournament matches. The film makers for that earlier movie put together a compelling and entertaining story in just about two hours, The additional forty minutes of screen time in ""Dangal"" is padded by repetitious scenes of training activity in the early part of the story that aren't all that necessary, while others are characteristically set to a musical accompaniment that seems to be a trademark of Hindi films. I did like the realism involved in staging the wrestling matches throughout the story, and the climactic final match was filled with suspense. With seconds to go, one will recall Mahavir's earlier explanation of the point scoring system, fully hoping that Geeta would somehow manage a five point take-down to insure a victory. The fact that this movie was based on the real life story of Mahavir Phogat and his wrestling daughters make it all the more fascinating."

" They took the Universal Sports Drama Handbook and ran with it
",0.0,0.6529,2017-11-17 00:00:00,6,At best an average movie from a technical perspective but audience would still find it engaging because of the lack of competition in serious and honest movie category in bollywood. The subject matter is definitely intriguing for the Global Audience but that's the end of the good stuff.There are a lot of problems in the movie but the biggest one is that the story is not really cinematic. The second act has some real moments which are engaging but The third act is very weak and the conflict with the coach was shoehorned to keep up the ante for the protagonist (which not very surprisingly was Aamir Khan's character instead of the two girls who fought their way to the top of World Wrestling).The movie is chock-full clich√©s. They took the Universal Sports Drama Handbook and ran with it - A strict misunderstood coach (a talented former failed player) seeking redemption ‚úîExtremely talented but unmotivated players who resent the coach ‚úîThe retaliation against the coachPlayers realising coach's importance due to an extremely lucky event not arising out of the ongoing events of the story ‚úîThe training montage ‚úîThe conflict with the egoist sports authority ‚úîThe tournament ‚úîCrashing in first match against the favourites ‚úîGradual uprising defying expectations ‚úîWinning the tournament against the same favourites in a nail- biting (extended/tied) match ‚úîAlso with the 4-5 montages and the extremely unnecessary narration by a passive character and the lack of character defining scenes (something that 'Chak De India' in the similar genre following all the above mentioned clich√©s; nailed) makes for a very superficial movie experience which is unacceptable given the potential of the subject matter at hand.Dangal is probably the highest grossing bollywood movie of the year and still not more than a very lenient 6; and its a very sad realization for me as a cinema lover in India.
" Aamir Khan Oscar Winning Movie and Career Best picture. Dangal a Soulful Hindustani Movie
",0.8225,0.9983,2017-11-11 00:00:00,10,"I missed in theater and know that Dangal a smashing hit breaking all records, year best picture, a marvellous biopic in Hindi movie history. AK it stands for Mr.Perfectionist, Ace of Bollywood, yes he was started collection tsunami in Hindi from Lagaan. That has been started since 2000's Still it continuing about 2 decades. His every picture different and remarkable in bollywood.Dangal story of wrestler and his two daughters, wow what a creation of characters, its realistic story biopic story even there is point to out mistake in each scene. Mr. Perfectionist Aamir performed as Father and Wrestler its tremendous job. He should eligible to win Best Actor role Oscar,National Award and Filmfare awards. I have been fan of him from Lagaan picture after Rang de Basanthi is also good but from 3 idiots movie he changed total bollywood level. 100cr clubs collection is big matter to bollywood his picture entered 300cr club. From there started collection tsunami till not stopped.Dangal a magic mark of Indian cinema 2000cr collection worldwide, yeas almost 50% more than that from Chinese market. They don't love the movie, they watched movie with heart. So first Indian movie created a big wonder in China. Coming to Aamir Acting is a major key and his daughters geetha, babitha wow they stunned acting in movie. In childhood characters also superb. Every Scene they are playing wrestling game, Emotional with father and Career, Gold for Country...so admirable. Perfect of Everything Story,Screenplay,Music is awesome a great melodies and inspiration title song.Dangal has to get many National awards in 2017, I pray to get Oscar Award also with this movie to Dangal picture and Actor. Because India is waiting for Oscar since many decades Aamir attempted with Lagaan movie it missed, but it could give positive i think so. 20 out of 10 is my rating.Dangal complete hindustani picture and Indian government should encourage every sport except cricket after watching this movie. Wrestling is A game but a girl, woman passion about this type of games to achieve something, of course its father's dream. Indian Government recognize every talented sports persons and encourage them."
" Another Good Aamir Khan film And Based On The True Story Of Mahavir Phogat.
",0.6908,0.9273,2017-11-10 00:00:00,8,"I have seen many good Aamir Khan films and this could be among his best ones. But I think my favorite is still Taare Zameen Par because it deals with a wide spectrum of problems faced by mentally challenged individuals in society.Plot: Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) is a former amateur wrestler and national champion based in Balali, a village in Haryana. He was forced by his father to give up the sport in order to obtain gainful employment. Dejected that he could not win a medal for his country, he vows that his unborn son will. Disappointed upon having four daughters, he gives up hope. But when his older daughters Geeta and Babita come home after beating up two boys in response to derogatory comments, he realises their potential to become wrestlers and begins coaching them.His methods seem harsh, including grueling early morning workouts and short haircuts to avoid lice. Despite facing backlash from the villagers, he goes ahead with them, training them in his makeshift mud pit. Initially, the girls resent their father for his treatment but soon realise that he wants them to have a good future and not grow up to be stereotypical housewives. Motivated, they willingly participate in his coaching. Mahavir takes the girls to wrestling tournaments where they wrestle with boys and defeat them. Unable to afford wrestling mats, he uses two layers of mattresses and trains them in freestyle wrestling to prepare them for competitive events. Geeta goes on to win the junior and senior championships at the State and national level before heading to the National Sports Academy in Patiala to train for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games.Verdict: acting, direction, photography, background sound-effects and music of the film is superbly executed. Nitesh Tiwari who made his directorial debut by co-directing Chillar Party (2011) which won the National Film Award for Best Children's Film for that year, directs Dangal with an extremely innovative approach. He makes us feel we are in the middle of the film.Similar films to watch: Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar(1992), Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India(2001), Iqbal(2005), Apne(2007), Irudhi Suttru(Tamil 2014) and remake Saala Khadoos(Hindi 2016).Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper."

" Watch Chakde India instead. This is just a regressive version.
",0.0,0.9987,2017-10-06 00:00:00,1,"Dangal: This overrated masterpiece? lol. 9 years ago we had a much better, a brilliant and progressive Chakde India. And now we have a regressive tale of a dominant male who physically tortures his daughters, turns them into sons, chooses their career without asking what they want to be which is exactly opposite of the great message given by 3 idiots, steals their childhood and youth and turns them into slaves against their wishes to fulfill a personal ambition? Meh. It is a no-risk same old story with just an average to good performance by Aamir. Nothing great. Anybody could have played Mahavir Singh Phogat. Eating cakes and going to gym isn't great acting. Lol.Are you planning to rewatch any Indian movies? Could you watch Chakde India, Swades, My Name Is Khan, Dilse.. ,Devdas, Veer Zara or Om Shanti Om? I hope you liked Fan which has a magnificent double lead performances like in Stephen King's Misery and Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy; and Raees which is like Indian Narcos where the lead character dies for the crime he didn't commit. You will also love Chakde over Dangal, Dilse.. over Rang De Basanti, Swades over Pk and Taare zameen par, My Name Is Khan which is as classic as Forrest Gump and Rainman over 3 idiots. You should check out DON series for some good action and psychological thrill. There are martial art techniques like WING CHUN, TRAPPING, KRAV MAGA in Don series. Extremely realistic fights. If you have watched The Notebook, you will love Jab Tak Hai Jaan over it and Om Shanti Om over La La Land. Paheli is a fantasy with women empowerment which is like a live action Disney-Pixar movie. Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani is a comedy satire on media and journalism and politics which was way ahead of its time and similarly Oh Darling Yeh Hai India which is on Netflix is the first bizarre musical thriller and a parody movie of Bollywood, Maya Memsaab is a adaptation of the classic Madam Bovary and a researchgate paper is written analyzing the implications of western influence on Indian women titled ""Colonization of Madam Bovary: Hindi cinema's Maya Memsaab"".You will love others like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Josh, Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, Dear Zindagi, Kal Ho Na Ho(you will love this over Fault in our Stars, A Walk to remember). Asoka is a wonderful historical fiction and also a biopic on a 250 BC ruler. You will enjoy it because it was actually made keeping international audiences in mind but unfortunately Lagaan got selected for Oscar nomination instead because of bias. The lead performance in DARR is an actual realistic portrayal of a disturbed obsessed person in love. It is a great psychological thriller and doesn't become a parody like Robert Deniro's Cape Fear. You must absolutely watch Baazigar and Anjaam. You will love the laugh in Baazigar, it is more reminiscent of the Joker and Anjaam is a true blue psychopath movie with no scope of rooting for the lead character. Like American Psycho. You didn't know Ra.One is an cross- cultural Indian superhero movie with an advanced futuristic virtual reality technology which is not explained similar to technologies in the Black Mirror show and musical dance numbers? The chase scene of Captain America Civil War seems to be inspired from Ra.one, Also Electro's look in Amazing spiderman 2 and Adam Sandler's Pixels ripped off Ra.One...you will find many pop culture beauties like very different and realistic VFX and H.A.R.T which is like Ironman's arc reactor. And sense of humour is similar to Deadpool's. It is better than its Enthiraan and Krrish counterparts, with a futuristic advanced virtual reality technnology that goes haywire. I think you should give them a chance rather than being biased towards specific film makers and actors. You talked about how you love feelings- driven, light hearted, hangout movies. You should watch Jab Harry Met Sejal. It is made in the style of European slice of life romcoms. Like the Before Trilogy. Have a great Diwali!"

LOL ..that's so stupid because he exactly did the same here only mahavier obsessed of his medal & her father with marrying his daughter both choose there daughters life bath & didn't ask them , didn't treat them as humans had there choice.Other scene make me so mad of this movie which is the lecture scene before the last match when he sat with geta and tell her to win for every woman and prove to all whose treat women not equal to men that women can do anything !!!!! are you laughing at me or yourself ???!!! Mahavier never believe in Geta as a daughter but as a son , when she is in the academy & decided to back look like as a woman even she had won on him but when she get back from home she loses every match after that, & when she leave that though of caring about herself and cut her hair back & started to became a boy again And under mahavier coaching she finally won the medal!!!!!!!!you just proved the other wise by the way.. That massage of #Chak De India (2007) & #Mary Kom (2014) No Way to match here.. i'm sorry , can't buy it ..The real MORAL of the story here , if you think your daughters are equal to boys and can do what boys can do even if they don't want to ,just torture them ,cut their hairs and make them look like boys ,treat them like boys and force them to do what you want just to prove that they are equal to boys . WHAT A TWISTED VIEW ON FEMINISM!!!!strongly not recommended i wish if i can get back my 2 hours that i wasted in that sadistic movie"
" Modern Story, Classic Style
",0.0,0.7326,2017-09-20 00:00:00,6,"The ""spoiler alert"" is here only because I wouldn't know how to write without it. As this film is based on a true story, plot development (for this review, anyway) is probably less important than how the film was made.Think of the prototypical template for classical Indian films: background, despair, tragedy, redemption, and lonnngg -- with lots of music and some dancing to lighten the load. There you have it. Production values in Dangal are high, and acting from all sides is terrific, right down to the snarky behaviour of the Scottish wrestler near the end. All we missed in this rags-to-riches tour-de-force of athletic accomplishment were a small child dancing around a tree and then getting hit by a train.If I could have changed anything, it would have been to tighten the editing and reduce running time by about 30 minutes, though most Indian viewers would probably disagree. I also would have given Babita a bit more of her due, since the film opens with Geeta and Babita apparently equal in skill and circumstance. Those musical interludes for me (as a non-Indian) got in the way after awhile. The national coach was also made out to be something of a loose cannon.But here in Hong Kong, Dangal has generated an unusual amount of interest for a foreign film, and an Indian one to boot. The moral of the story--father knows best--will not be lost on local families.My last words: excellent film, probably an 8 or 9 if only it had a shorter, tighter running time."

And now we have a regressive tale of a dominant male who physically tortures his daughters, turns them into sons, chooses their career without asking what they want to be which is exactly opposite of the great message given by 3 idiots, steals their childhood and youth and turns them into slaves against their wishes to fulfill a personal ambition? Meh. It is a no-risk same old story with just an average to good performance by Aamir. Nothing great. Anybody could have played Mahavir Singh Phogat. Eating cakes and going to gym isn't great acting.

",0.4767,0.9926,2017-07-05 00:00:00,9,"This year two movies have importantly spoken how sports and the involvement of female gender in the same, Irudhi Suttru\Saala Khadoos (2016) speaked for Women Boxing and Dangal (2016) has spoken Women Wrestling. We had Chak De India (2007) which also focused and emphasized on Women Hockey and was able to present a detailed view of what the sport is about and all the politics involved in the same.In my view, the above mentioned movies are very important in such a way that they were able to showcase about how the feminine gender is seen across India and their involvement in sports. These movies have touched some specific areas of bold and controversial topics and given a minimum limelight of what's happening in our country for Sports especially considering the female gender.Dangal directed by Nitesh Tiwari is a multi-layered movie from its start to finish. Let me give some detailed explanation about what i felt when watched the movie.Dangal is a Movie about Wrestling In India.The initial title track ""Dangal"" has visuals of how really Wrestling is done in India, how the people involved in wrestling look with bulk body even some are with seen belly ,how the wrestlers are trained using rigorous methods , their diet and relaxation methods and much more. For in India many came to know about Wresting mainly through WWE telecasted in Star Sports\Ten Sports which we all believed was real apparently which was just showbiz done faking the viewers.Dangal is a Movie which speaks about Feminism indirectly. It tells a message that girls aren't only meant to clean, cook, marry, reproduce and spend the rest of their life in monotonous way how the society has been seeing and treating them. A particular scene in the movie depicts a girl saying that how females are treated and seen without even being asked whether they want to live such a kind of life and she advises her friends saying that ""at least you have a father who always thinks and cares about you"" and also she says like ""Girls are seen like a burden in their own home after a certain age hence they are pushed into the Wedding Well"".Dangal is a Movie about a person who wants to Make His Country In World Arena. Here Aamir Khan plays Mahavir Singh Phogat, who wants to fulfill his dream getting a Gold for India in Wrestling Sport and according to him he feels that only a Boy can do it. In his attempts to pursue his dream,he gets blessed with four daughter which gives him a mild scare feel that his dream may go unfulfilled. Later as the time progresses and happening of some interesting events he realizes and exclaims ""Gold is Gold, it doesn't matter who gets it ; Boy or Girl"".So coming to Dangal as a movie from a normal audience point of view, this is a Biopic of Mahavir Singh Phogat and his living efforts on how he made his daughters Geeta and Babita make their country proud in World Sports Arena for Professional Wrestling and how they helped him achieve his dream.The movie is completely shouldered from start to finish by the Stellar Performances of its complete Star Cast; Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Fatima Sana Shaikh ,Zaira Wasim,Sanya Malhotra,Suhani Bhatnagar. There is not single scene or moment in the movie which is out of the story.Coming to the acting department, Aamir Khan has a given a splendid performance for Mahavir's role. Be his emoting, reacting and mainly his physical transformation, he has got into the skin of the character and lived the character itself.Sakshi Tanwar anchoring the role of Daya Shobha Kaur has played the perfect foil for Aamir Khan.There are some scenes where she scores without even speaking a word and conveying all the emotions with her eyes and facial expressions.The main credit and success of Dangal lies with Fatima Sana Shaikh ,Zaira Wasim,Sanya Malhotra and Suhani Bhatnagar who play the Younger and Older Geeta and Babita.Flawless performances from them throughout the movie such they steal some scenes though having Aamir and Sakshi in the same.Pritam makes his impression with the Dangal Title Track which also runs as Background Music throughout the movie for elevating the scenes.To conclude my review, Dangal is Terrific Movie powered by Stellar Performances and a Gripping Screenplay which keeps the audiences hooked till the end.A Must Watch Movie for all."

There is nothing new to the genre, there is nothing surprising and it is all so predictable from the very beginning. The acting is usual childish Indian - good, but yet the storyline is so thin......there a honestly better Indian films (like Wednesday or 3 idiots) where the story line is more unique - and includes better music with the ever beloved Indian dance scenes.I wish IMDb would introduce a regional voting - keeping these films out of Top 250."

Almost everyone's performance impeccable and a real treat to watch.But what astounded me the most is the screenplay, it was simply sublime. The script was not only well written and careful about tiniest details but also sends a pretty strong message about women empowerment. It was also able to depict almost all the troubles Mahavir Singh and his family face in the society. That is why I have to say Director Nitesh Tiwari did a splendid job in filming this movie.I do not want write much about the film because I want you all to go watch this outstanding film.

",0.0,0.9484,2017-05-30 00:00:00,1,"yes i voted 1 out of 10 for this movie and maybe i'm the only idiot to do so but hear me out.Dangal shows the struggle of Geeta Phogat an real life girl who was born in 80's and those of us who were know how difficult it was for a girl to compete with men due to our social stigmas.The achievement of Geeta Phogat and how she reached there was no less of a miracle than what was shown in the movie with dramatized scenes to spice it all up. That was the biggest mistake of Amir Khan, i believe that for the real life Geeta Phogat the struggles must have been something that we cannot even imagine and how she won the gold becoming the first Indian woman ever to do so and her story as it happened without any changes whatsoever has to be told to the world because she deserves that respect, instead of the artificiality that was shown in the movie. It would have deserved the Oscar if they would have replicated the exact and perfectly copied fight from the original fight which was historic for Indian women wrestlers,just like they did in ""Miracle"" the movie about Ice Hockey. Or at least have a alternate version of the movie and re-release it before Oscars,so that Amir Khan can win the first Oscar too for India just like her Pahalwan did in real life. Comments anyone..."

" good movie you wish for another three hours
",0.6808,0.9928,2017-05-20 00:00:00,10,"after the first half hour i really wanted to be it longer.I am not an expert movie critic.i just enjoy watching movies.i will say there is over dramatize scenes in the movie still i liked it for example at the final match the father being locked down even that wasn't in the real story still nice touch to show that the character Geeta can win this match on her own without her fathers help.unlike we used to it.maybe that was real story.the character young Geeta came forward to me .maybe that's because of the events at that time period. she was cute, beautiful and also bad-ass character.entering wrestling area in slow motion were the moments i enjoyed.feel proud of her like someone i know.i felt the same for Zaira Wasim when i saw Jennifer Lawrence at winters bone.Zaira Wasim will be a big star i imagine.it s a good movie to watch with family.its something inspiring.as for Aamir Khan i always admire actors to gain weight or loose for the role.he stands in a very natural way as a father.well played caring father and hard coach.Fatima Sana Shaikh also played good her role .she makes you feel that she is going out of her purpose and loosing her form.at this moment she will make you say 'come on go to your home. let your father train you'.on the other hand when the characters grow up and need to replace with new actors or actresses,i don't say wait till they grow up and continue with them.i know that's to much to ask as an audience but at least you can look for resemblance when choosing players. that's not only for this movie,generally.that was the only moment i said i am watching a movie.other than that the movie takes you in the story.yet Fatima Sana Shaikh ,Sanya Malhotra and Aparshakti Khurana well played their role.as i said that's not an expert credit.so it has a good story, well played characters.there is too much to say but it s something you wont regret to spend your time.go watch and enjoy it.certainly i will watch this movie again."

" Hypocrisy and abduction of freewill
",-0.4215,0.9938,2017-05-19 00:00:00,5,"While I understand Aamir khan is just an actor who is portraying a role, I find it highly hypocritical that he does TV shows like satya meva jayate, the essence is to fight for human rights and equality of gender. It is so disgusting how 9.5 out of 10 Indians like this movie without realizing how a failed wrestler is enforcing his will on to his innocent girls. I get it girls can do whatever boys can do ideology but this is not about equal rights this is about free- will. A human be it a girl or a boy has a right to live his or her life without someone telling them what to do with their lives. I wanted to be a doctor but i turned out to be a successful software engineer, I do well with my life but I'm not satisfied. Point is Indian society is succumbed to the idea of do what parents tell you, your life is like a car driven by your parents, what you really want to do doesn't matter in most cases. This ideology has to change. Like how will Smith in pursuit of happiness says to his ""don't ever let tell you what to do with your life, if you want to be something just go get it"". We should let kids achieve whatever they want to achieve rather than enforcing your will into the kids. I know a lot of people will not understand my stance, I'm hoping someone rational understands the point and let their kids achieve their own dreams not the parent's.Acting in the movie is a perfect 10, story is a 5/10 and I wouldn't like to see Aamir khan doing this kind of role, at the end of the day he's an actor but in India actors are role models and semi gods. I want to see a more meaningful movie like taare zameen par from Aamir khan."

",0.6597,0.9978,2017-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Dangal is a very charming bio pic, I have been a fan of Aamir Khan's work ever since watching ""3 idiots"" and have since been a fan of many Indian films, which gets me quite excited to see this film. Dangal is well acted, directed, the music was great as well, but it seems to lack the depth that was so captivating in Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots or even in the more recent movie ""PK"".As a real-life inspired bio pic this film couldn't have been done any better, it is a feel good story and focuses heavily on a father- daughter relationship, an element of the film that brings lots of emotions to the table. As many of Aamir's work there are often these very emotional elements and like he has done before he has succeeded in this film. This is an inspiring story and a very empowering film as well. The narrative flow of the story was good and I thought that the song choices were spot on, really helps building the emotions in this film.Aamir Khan's acting was amazing and so are the other Indian stars who I am unfamiliar with. Because of Indian film's tendencies to last for long durations there really is a chance to tell this story in immense detail which helped to elevate its narrative without drifting away into any irrelevant details. But that really is all that is to say about this particular film, it works well as a sports/drama biopic and is well made, the thing is there is nothing much to it other than that, Aamir Khan's film has a tendency to explore important ideas and to really be able to delve deep into them, while there is the central theme of sexism in India and acts as a powerful social commentary unlike his previous bouts this really isn't as inspiring. So in conclusion this is an amazing film and deserves many praises however I feel that there is a definite room for improvement."

I am not Aamir Fan. and i am sure, there hv many who are not fan, but still watch Aamir's movie.. because people trust his vision nd he hardly disappoints us.. this is the best of 2016 indeed¬ÖMost people love movie for their entertainment value. If that movie can inspire or teaches something that is extra plus. SRK and Salman are bigger star because mass people get entertained by their movie. But from 2000 Aamir is giving extraordinary film one after another. May be some his film like Dhobi Ghat or Talaash can not be appreciated by masses as it needs refined taste and sensibilities. To me Talaash is better film than Dhoom3 but Dhoom3 made much bigger business than Taalash for his its mass appeal. SRK is very charming person no doubt but if he always look for big director, big production house and popular heroin but on the other hand Aamir work with new or not so successful director and give Superhit after Superhit.

The best part about this flick is the one and only Aamir Khan himself who is known as a perfectionist of Bollywood when it comes to giving best films to the box office. After two years of super blockbuster film ""PK"" 2014 where Aamir unleashed all the limits of his perfectionism, he is back with a bang again along with his 2016's super powerful flick ""Dangal"" which is a story about a former wrestler champion Mahavir Singh Phogat and his efforts for training his own daughters Geeta and Babita who are India's most well known and celebrated female wrestlers who have also garnered medals in Commonwealth Games. The flick is starring Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra. The film has already hit the theater's on December 23, 2016. And if you haven't planned to watch this film I have brought you 5 solid reasons to book tickets and watch ""Dangal"".1. Aamir's honest dedicationMr. Perfectionist (Aamir Khan) is a keen actor when it comes to exhibit the authenticity of his character in any of his film. In this film Dangal, Aamir has to exhibit one character in two different physiques according to the demand of script in which he plays both young and old Mahavir Singh's character which again has a twist. The young Mahavir Singh in an athletic, muscular and broad shouldered physique whereas the old Mahavir Singh who trains his own daughters for wrestling is a fat, chubby, over weight and pot bellied personality of 97 kg. To play such an overweight personality, Aamir ate whatever he wanted and put on weight to reach 97 kg almost 100 kg and then he prepared himself to lose weight to get back to a fit and muscular physique with six packs to play the young Mahavir wrestler's role. This is what we call honest dedication by an honest actor. Amir Khan fans always wait eagerly for his master flicks because this perfect actor always come up with an excellent and exceptional script to keep his fans and viewers engaged. ""Dangal"" the biopic of Mahavir Singh Phogat wrestler is not only about his athletic career but also about his inspirational journey as a father and a trainer of his own daughters who are India's well known female wrestlers."

Dangal gives you a peek in to people's lives who have a commitment towards sport and passionate towards nation but also the problems they face while they fulfill their dreams. Entire cast Aamir, Sakshi, Fatima, Saanya, Zaira and Suhani did an excellent job and justice to their roles. Needless to say Aamir excels to do what he is good at and keeps you occupied with his intense acting. The female leads (especially the younger and older Geeta) were awesome in their roles when it comes to the tackle scenes be it in the mud or on the turf. The camera work capturing fights in the bout needs a special mention here as they stand out and gives you a treat of a real combat between two wrestlers. For those who saw the trailers multiple times the first half is an easy guess about what happens next, but otherwise the movie is excellent piece of work by the entire crew of Dangal. Full marks to the Director, Aamir and his girls."
" One of those Indian films you have to watch!
",0.0,0.9579,2017-01-29 00:00:00,10,Nitesh Tiwari has done a fantastic job. The movie is very different from the pretentious glamour that is visible in most Indian films today. It is unique yet relatable. Aamir Khan has once again proved pushed the boundaries for what Indian actors can and must achieve and has left a lasting impression with this work. The stars of the movie remain the two little girls that portray Geeta and Babita. The first half is a master piece. The second half is entertaining but gives in slightly to the dramatic factor that most Indian audience demands of a blockbuster. It is a must watch for anyone who loves Indian cinema. One that you don't want to miss!
" A perfectly mediocre film only worth watching for the terrific fight sequences
",0.765,0.9945,2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Not only does Dangal methodically check off every sports movie clich√© out there, it goes a step further into general movie clich√©s. Initially, I almost forgave some of them because it is, after all, ""based on a true story"", but as it turns out, it changed a lot of facts to fit those clich√©s. Artistic liberty makes sense when used to increase dramatic tension, but to make the story worse? That's just missed potential.The actors do a good job, especially Fatima Sana Shaikh, who plays the wrestler Geeta Phogat with just the right mix of intensity and vulnerability. Babita Kumari, played by Sanya Malhotra, is unfortunately sidelined to a mind boggling degree, the film being only concerned with what she meant to Geeta, and never interested in her as a subject.Thematically, it gets tricky. From a sports drama perspective, it is definitely inspiring to see the sacrifices that are required for Geeta and Babita to get where they need to be, but the film also tries to push itself as feminist, which doesn't work because the sacrifices the women make are forced on them by their father, Mahavir Phogat, who seems far more concerned with seeing his children fulfill the dreams he once held for himself than he is with helping them achieve what they want for themselves. When the girls complain about this, there is actually a scene, and I'm not kidding, where another girl tells them ""at least your father isn't forcing you to get married to someone you've never met."" Because forcing them to give up any hope for a happy childhood in service of a dream they do not dream is so much better *sarcasm*. A big part of the reason this doesn't work is the presentation, as instead of leaving the question of whether Mahavir's position was justified up to the viewer to answer, the film glorifies him as an ideal to follow, and every time there's an opportunity to show us that the sisters are, in fact, enthusiastic for the sport, the moment is instead used to depict enthusiasm for winning, enthusiasm for respect, enthusiasm for pleasing their father, and even, out of nowhere, enthusiasm for making the country proud.Apart from being thematically muddled, the movie is plagued with narrative problems such as unnecessary voice-overs explaining how a character is feeling, abrupt transitions to pointless songs, simplistic, one-dimensional villains (why did this film need villains anyway? Wasn't society enough?) and montages that last forever, leading to a bloated 160-minute runtime.And yet I think it's overall an okay movie because outside of the fights, the humor is enough to tide you over, and when the fight scenes are on, in spite of the predictable outcomes, it's a blast.Overall, I wouldn't recommend seeing Dangal. It's not like it's in dire need of your money anyway."
" A must watch!
",0.0,0.854,2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I felt as though I was physically present in the stadium of the wrestling scenes which made me completely clap, scream and also gave me a lot of goosebumps.I especially loved Fatima Sana Shaikh, the elder Geeta's role, not once I felt a bad remark on her performance as an actor. The wrestling scenes were highly entertaining and hats off to the team that is responsible.As with most of Aamir sir's movies, this too has a message for the society.Mahavir, before Geeta's finals, reminds the latter that his match will be looked to as an inspiration for any girl all across India to break loose from the clutches of a Patriarchal society."
" Dangal is one of the best sports drama I had ever seen with terrific performances and wrestling choreography.
",0.8074,0.9989,2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Dangal (2016): I waited for this film since I watched its trailer.I have waited a lot for its release date but unfortunately this movie didn't got released in our home town.So,I lost hopes of watching this in theater and waited for its Blu-ray version.But surprisingly Dangal showed up in our local theater today.So the moment I saw the poster,I rushed to the theater to watch this already declared classic.SO how is it?Plot: Mahavir Singh Phogatv(Aamir Khan) is a former wrestling champion had to quit the sport due to his family pressure as it was not helping his family financially.He only dreams that his son should win Gold Medal for India in wrestling but back to back he has four daughter's.Mahavir feels his dream cant be complete and starts staying away from the sport,while his daughter Geeta (Zaira Wasim and Fatima Sana Shaikh) and Babita (Suhani Bhatnagar and Sanya Malhotra) are growing the notices that they have quality of being wrestlers and starts training them,Geeta and Babita have to get a hard training and start to dislike their father for this but they realize that their father is doing this for their betterment and take the sport seriously.Geeta soon becomes a a known wrestler in the state and wins Nationals too.But fate starts going in wrong direction when Geeta goes far away from her father's training.....Plus Points:1)Performances: Once again,an award winning performance from Mr.Perfectionist Aamir Khan.His dedication and passion towards acting is visible in each and every scene.His transformation for the role of Mahavir is commendable.The two girls are played by Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar who win us over with innocence and exasperation before showing us how expertly they move.Fatima ass grown Geeta did a wonderful job.Her hard work is seen everywhere where she mimics the true wrestling techniques with perfection.Sakshi Tanwar, who plays the hapless mother, trying to strike a balance between an unyielding father and daughters who just want to be girls a little longer is brilliant in her role.2)Wrestling choreography: This is the major break through for this movie and definitely helped a lot to achieve a special place in sports based films.In Dangal,the wrestling choreography is excellent and strikingly credible.All the wrestling matches are nail biting because of its realistic making.Kudos to the film makers for bringing a true sports feel.3)Screenplay and Direction: Screenplay of Dangal is high on emotions and an aspiring father's goals.There are lot of remarkable scenes in Dangal where audience will get emotional.Especially the scene where Geeta wrestles with Mahavir is one of the best moments in cinema.Even the use of National Anthem at the climax is a brilliant taking.Nitesh Tiwari successfully delivered one of the best sports drama to Indian Cinema.He should be applauded for bringing us the tale of unknown heroes who achieved fame for India,.4)Music: Pritam's music is solid and his background score is brilliant.Dangal title track definitely gives goosebumps every time it plays in the movie.5)Cinematography: Sethu Sriram's textured cinematography oscillates between the poetic -- there is a lovely slow-motion shot of dirt from a shaking head flying across a red sky -- and the powerfully prosaic, with the wrestling scenes looking startlingly real.Minus Points: None except that like all sports dramas this one is also highly predictable.But predictability never matters when there is enough inspiring content,My rating 9/10"
" Dangal: an inspirational movie
",0.5106,0.9818,2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"With word of mouth, you may have all known what a big hit ""Dangal"" became lately and the critical accolades the film received. Instead of taking the promotions for granted, I insist you to watch this film first.The film is based on a true story of an Indian wrestler, Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trains his two daughters, Gita and Babita, to win the international level wrestling competitions. It's commendable that few film makers have started to make movies on the real heroes of the country, whose tales of heroism are often unheard of. It takes a story from a small village of Haryana and takes it to an international milieu. Many are relating this movie with year's another hit, ""Sultan."" But these two films are in no way to be compared of. Though both the films are on wrestling, ""Dangal"" explores many entities like the social discrimination on girls, state of sports federation, father daughter relationships.Where the film explores the wrestling arena from a small Haryana village to a national level training centre, the film is also filled with emotions, wit, and other finer nuances of life. Aamir Khan as usual is good, but the two girls as Geeta and Babita both were outstanding. Watched this film in theatre, and the audiences were seen applauding when the girls enter the arena and play for their country. The Haryani environment and the dialects used in the film gives it a mesmerizing touch. Just like ""Chakde India"" and ""Mary Kom,"" ""Dangal"" will remain one of the finest sports movies to come lately.Rating: 3 stars out of 4"
" A 2016 masterpiece.
",0.6249,0.7837,2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"This movie is Nitesh's best movie. Dangal became the finest movie of year 2016 in Bollywood.The execution and direction of the movie is superb. It shows the mindset of the people in villages (and most of the part of India) who thinks that daughter is just Load to their family and have only place for house Hold work. Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir's character) fight all the odds and train his daughters to be professional wrestlers. The movie also brings the mindset of the India Parents, that they can chose the future of their children and prepare them for it.Movie don't take much time to collect and start the story. The in-depth story of the daughters training session is very interesting and you will get attached to it. Action sequences of Geetha's matches are very well executed in early age and later the professional matches. The only disappointed part in the movie is to bring the NSA coach as bad character who conspire to put Mahavir in a room while Geetha play final match. Movie picks a Melodrama (wasn't necessary) at that stage.Overall performance: 8/10"
" Dangal a must watch for everyone!!! ((Spoilers))
",0.0,0.9883,2017-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Me rooting for Dangal has nothing to do with being the no.1 Aamir khan fan :P. I do eagerly await his movies. He always has the most unique scripts, his acting is seriously perfect to the core, he makes me laugh, cry, angry..... This guy is a genius and lucky son of a gun when it comes making movies. Dangal is another gem added to his treasury of hit films.Dangal shines through in every way you cannot even think of. Dangal has all the perfect masala without the annoyance of stupid bollywood songs. I love bollywood music don't get me wrong, but not when its adds nothing to the scenes or the film in whole. Dangal has songs which progress a scene and that worked well with me.Aamir is such a genius for a reason. He wowed public by making his transformation videos viral. We all thought, he would have many scenes as the fit Aamir khan. But what impresses me is that he went through all that trouble of putting on weight and then losing it through sheer hard work for just one measly scene. Yes, he only has about 5-10 mins of scenes as the Fit and younger Mahavir Phogat.Yes there are flaws in this film, no film is perfect but that didn't stop me from giving Dangal a 10\10. Guys i suggest you all Indians or non Indians to watch Dangal for its absolute awsomeness."
" Not happy.
",-0.4585,0.9901,2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Dangal is the most overrated film I have watched in a very long time. Every unbiased movie lover, I think, would agree to the fact that the cinematic representation is not any different from any sports related movie you pick, be it Gavin O'Connor's ""Miracle"" or Shimit Amin's ""Chak De India"". There goes your point for originality. Now if we take the ""Biographical"" thing into account then the film at most can be described as ""Inspired by real life events"". Winning at the last round at the last moment may be more adrenaline rushing for the audience but that, in my opinion, is demeaning for the athlete who originally won the game 1-0, 7-0. Talking of demeaning, the way sports persons have been depicted in the film is something to talk about. The fake things that are shown in the movie in the name of cinematic liberty just for the sake of creating sympathy in the audience, be it locking up Mr. Phogat in a room during finals or the Australian player's interview, both are very against Sportsman spirit. Aamir Khan's dedication is unquestionable, he also is a good actor. He took great efforts to look like a wrestler for so little screen time. All the talks of perfection and look at overweight actress who played the Australian wrestler. Does she even have an athlete's physique? An entire film can not be made with one dedicated actor. There are also contradictory statements about women's equality in the movie, which I am not going into much details as this is a ""biographical movie"". At least let's not hurt other's emotion just to make one person look like a hero when dealing with real people. In our country it's a very dangerous thing to affect people's emotion in a wrong way. I feel bad for the real NSA coach of Geeta Phogat."
" Aamir Khan was good, child actors were'nt good, predictable story.
",0.7003,0.9073,2017-01-15 00:00:00,3,"Had good heart and good acting (especially Aamir Khan) and the cinematography during the fights were pretty alright but the child actors were pretty bad and the movie was really, REALLY formulated and predictable. (also the message was good, but Cool Cat Save the Kids has a good message. why doesn't that have a 9.1 on IMDb?)Spoilers from here on out: At the end when she needs the points to win, it was the EXACT amount Aamir Khan said earlier in the movie, and there was 10 seconds left. hmmm... wonder whats going to happen... and then on top of that, we hear Aamir Khan repeating what the throw is to get the amount of points (i don't remember how many, so lets just say it was 7) at that moment. SERIOUSLY?!?!? It was pretty obvious when Aamir Khan said it the first time that it would be re-incorporated. Then towards the end of the fight when she needs exactly 7 points to win, and the only way to get that is the throw, you know its going to happen. The movie insults your intelligence by just SAYING IT AGAIN. Also, I had no idea what was going to happen in this movie. The day of my parents said that there was an Aamir Khan movie near us in theaters so we just went and saw it. I had NO idea of what was going to happen in this movie at all. I didn't look anything up or anything, yet I could still predict what would happen in the movie. another thing to add: the motivation for why the girls continued to fight in the beginning was kind of dumb. Instead of realizing by themselves that women are oppressed in India and they are given a chance, they are just told this by some random girl who we see for the first time who gets married. It was forced and bad. I don't write movies but they could have done this in a way that the girls found out by themselves, which really would have developed their characters more (imo)."

" wins hearts and the gold
",0.5719,0.9961,2017-01-12 00:00:00,10,"If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down.SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light- hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary.DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character.FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack- lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide- shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication.ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie.FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016."
" Inches away from greatness
",0.0,0.9972,2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"This is the journey of a resolute father pitching his girls in the unfamiliar sporting arena dominated by men wrestling with stern opponents as well as the prevalent norms of our society. Director Nitesh Tiwari's ""Dangal"" is the back story of two sisters, Geeta and Babita's claim to fame in the international wrestling arena. The story starts with their Father Mahavir Singh Phogat, a former National Champion in Wrestling, who nurtures the aspiration that one day his to be born son will fulfill his unfulfilled dream. The dream of bringing gold medal for the country in an international event. But destiny had other plans and the couple were blessed with girl children for four consecutive times. Having given up on his aspirations, a twist of fate enables Mahavir to get rid of the social shackles and urges him to pursue his ambition with his two elder girls - Geeta and Babita. Thus begins the arduous journey of the Haryanvi Wrestler and his two daughters battling with society's gender stereotyping, social taboos and the administration's pathetic disposition towards sports.Thus begins the compelling tale of the trio which keeps you engaged throughout. The script indeed was the real hero and the team of Tiwari, Piyush Gupta, Shreyans Jain and Nikhil Mehrotra did a commendable job. The crux of filming a biopic is all about selecting the interesting events and leaving out the dull bits. Here the selections are spot on. The point at which the placid man turns tyrant and wakes up the girls at the crack of the dawn along with imposing draconian measures like abstaining them from TV shows or spicy foods and even cropping their hair sets the mood of the story. Songs do play a very vital part in narrating the plot. What could have been a stressing training regime was depicted in wry rustic humour in the Haryanvi hip hop and rap ""Hanikarak Bapu"". Daler Mehendi's rendition of the title track as well as Dhakkad chip in perfectly. Kudos to good use of music by Pritam and soulful lyrics by Amitabha Bhattacharya. The Tughlaq like arrogance was brought out well in Aamir but the same got redeemed as well. The scene where Geeta and Babita's schoolmate explains that ""atleast your Father is thinking about you"" is beautifully brought out. The chemistry after a change of perspective of the girls was even more riveting. The crisis in the script was well injected. The tussle and the mental separation between Mahavir and the young Geeta (Fatima) heightened the tension. The peak was reached during the rumble between the two and it is one of the finest scenes ever. But the plot got a bit derailed during the closing quarter of the movie. The antagonist angle appeared a bit clumsy with unnecessary exchange of words often making a mockery out of the head coach. The concluding doses of inspiration seemed way over the top. Mahavir shouting out amongst the crowd for Geeta may have got along fine in an Akhada but not definitely in a Commonwealth stadium. The National Anthem angle was unnecessarily introduced and the scene failed to create any sort of cinematic impact. The little girl shouting out ""Bharat Mata ki Jai "" finally reiterated the fact that it's a Bollywood movie. Was Aamir Khan trying to make it up for his ""intolerance"" remark? The overdose of jingoism and machismo deprived the movie from it's pristine effort of being a rare sports film in the history of world cinema. Yes you read that right, World Cinema. Regarding the execution, a 51 year old Aamir Khan with his beefy physique and grey hair plays the stubborn Mahavir to perfection. He literally lived the role displaying great authority and austere training skills. Sakshi as Mahavir's wife gives a controlled yet strong performance. Fatima and Saniya are discoveries with tons of acting talent. Zahira Wasim as the child Geeta and Suhani Bhatnagar as the child Babita are the ones who will be etched in our memory for long.Ritwik Sahore as the girl's cousin Omkar with his deadpan looks and comic timing impresses all. The film is probably the most authentic sports film ever made in India and full credit goes to Tiwari and cinematographer Sethu Sriram for detailing finer aspects of wrestling without pissing off. To conclude Dangal loses it's hold of greatness but nevertheless is a fine movie. Do watch it."
" Yet another masterpiece from Aamir khan!!
",0.6892,0.996,2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"All i can say here, when in doubt watch a Aamir Khan movie because you know you cant go wrong. He doesn't make much movies, but when he does it gets you talking about his movies for as long as one can.. what more movies like 3Idiots/Ghajini/Lagaan etc which has gone down as one of the finest movies in the Indian Cinema. Back to Dangal, it's by far one of the best biopics ever made over the years. No doubt there were a lot of good movies made in 2016, but this movie was a perfect closure for the year 2016.Absolutely loved every single bit of the movie right from the direction, screenplay and dialogues were kept real. The movie was gripping right from the start and progressed on the 2nd half. One may forget that you were watching a movie. I know nothing about wrestling nor am i a fan, but this movie will keep you hooked up till the very end. Those girls were absolutely brilliant in their respective roles and well as for Aamir.. He had once again delivered a stupendous performance.The message was clear, gold medalists are not made , they are nurtured . It requires sheer dedication, grit,discipline,support and right attitude to get there and this movie was perfection. So much love for the entire team for an excellent execution and terrific performance. Standing ovation!!"

AK is a marketing genius on good content.The 2 standout event in the screenplay really made the story gripping driven by reason are below which is inspiring. 1. The daughters hitting the harassers and AK spotting their wrestling talent. 2. Accepting forced wrestling life as far better then dumb wedded life.The richness and quality in production has made this ordinary story presentable. The Commonwealth games(US, China and Russia are not part of it) for India is always a cakewalk right from 1960's but still Women achieving in wrestling for the first time from village is commendable(Geetha's younger sister also won silver in the same event(2010 Common wealth games) portrayed in movie and she herself won bronze in world wrestling championship which is more greater then this as its world level competition). AK and Coach conflicting in their instructions to Geetha is interesting. The last scene which has AK locked in room is little dramatic but still reasonable and bearable.AK acting is subtle as usual with the hype of stout and slim combo, his cameo as young AK is a relief in the epilogue.Just wondering and admiring how he got evoluted so better after his first 15 years movies(good that he survived with less hits until then) after Lagaan(2001). Pre Lagaan many of his movies are just copy/inspired from Hollywood movies(nevertheless he didn't write/direct them indeed) like The Godfather, It happened one night, On the Waterfront, win a Date with Tad Hamilton, Kramer Vs Kramer, An Affair to remember. He has come a long way and learned it the hard way, but now made it bigger with his sincerity. Also surprised by his feminist and out of box movies with less importance to heroism. I think he got better over the age and bangs every time on December release right from TZP. Just like TZP AK has underplayed himself which is great. Still wondering how AK strikes balance between box office and critics. Bangs on Bulls eye as usual for AK this time."

" A very nice(fictional...I say) Bio pic I have ever seen
",0.0,0.9891,2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"At first, I would like to say that this is a very interesting(fictional-there's a reason) Bio-picture. But this movie is getting too much praise than it actually deserves. The reason I said fictional because some of the events did not happen. I think most of our Indians realized just now(after watching this movie) that this movie is about nationalism, women empowerment and Sports and they should need this kind of movies and they started posting in social media and praising this movie, giving more attention than it deserves. I agree that this movie is good, it deserves our attention but it's not an eye-opener and it's not a ""one in a million movie"".I would say this movie's concept is similar to one of the top 250 movies(IMDb) ChakDe India. The words like Nationalism, Sportsmanship, women empowerment better suits 'ChakDe India' rather than Dangal. If you are an Aamir Khan's Fan then I would suggest you watch this movie. The casting was good, this is not a one-man show. And one more thing, this movie is complete sports domestic drama with emotions mixed. Finally, Dangal is a good movie but not the best movie."
" Thank you Team Dangal !!!
",0.5229,0.9907,2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Finally, my wait for a Bollywood movie that can be repeatedly watched is over. The movie has everything - innocence, good humor, excellent story and exceptionally strong performances. And most importantly - Indian-ness. The movie never appeared dull and the music suited the moments of the movie. Thanks to team Dangal for finally restoring my faith in Bollywood. They have shown that even without CGI and making women half-naked, excellent movies can be made based on culture and traditions of the land. Dangal will go down certainly as the best movie of 2016 and perhaps one of the best movies in a decade. Last time I was so in awe of a movie while coming out of a theatre was ""chak-de India""."
" Watchable just once
",0.0,0.97,2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,Nitesh Tiwari needs a real script and real story. This movie almost put me to sleep but the fact that it was based on a true story made me go through it. Some of the dialogues were cringe worthy and scenes dragging. I have absolutely no idea how this movie is now a blockbuster. I must be seriously missing something. The editing was so lacking that I wanted to fast forward to what I wanted to get at rather than relish the pace. Indian cinema needs a visionary filmmaker and stories. Chak De was 10 times better and can be enjoyed even to this day. Not that Aamir didn't work hard for it but the package just didn't come in as well as it could have been. Compromises must have been made to alter the story in favor of mass consumption but then that is what will happen when you bring in a big star. Alas Mahavir Phogat just got a very limiting picture of his life and sacrifices which means a lot to us more than this 150 minutes of lazy filmmaking

The movie was just amazing guys...I mean the movie was based on a real life story so it was going to be different to a typical Hindi movie...on top of that it's one of the khan's so I knew the movie was going to be good before I even watched it...i have rated the movie 10/10 cause it truly deserves it...I am from the UK born and bred, I watch all sorts of movies, but Dangal just felt so real so to give myself a reality check I had to watch it twice, it was better every time I watched the movie, my favourite star is (Salman Khan) before anybody judges my review that I'm Amir khans fan that's why I'm giving it 10/10, the movie dangal, it has comedy, drama, emotion, sports and most of all reality... No bollywood or Hollywood or the critics can say this movie is not worthy of life time recognition, the movie will be remembered years to come in the most positive way, a great message to women out there...watch the movie in cinemas you will appreciate it....big time...!!!"
" Against use of national anthem in between movie
",0.0,0.9178,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"This review is especially against use/misuse of national anthem in between movie. It was completely unnecessary. Also the pitch of the same was high enough differentiating it with regular movie sound, which give enough impression that it was done knowingly.could had been dim as it was started completely. seems to be added after supreme court ruling.Also, the movie is ""biopic"" but has lots of facts twisted. Like about coach and this whole lock up incident. Hence deserve lowest rating as possible.I am pretty sure of it being added later. Because, of the news that, it got censor board clearance on 15th Dec itself. Also, the court order was around 30th Nov. Good enough time, for minor editing like this."
" A Powder Keg of a Monster-tainer
",0.0,0.9995,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"If I had seen Dangal last year, it would have easily blazed into my Top 30 list. Being a sport genre film, you will know what will transpire in the final climatic scene from a mile away, but it does hit all the usual tropes and emotional beats with verve and aplomb. The good ones in this genre know how to make the arduous learning journey resemble inspirational life lessons and will also make you feel vested in the story. This is not just a good one, it is a great one. Dangal is a biographical sports drama film directed by Nitesh Tiwari. It stars Aamir Khan as Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. The former is India's first female wrestler to win at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she won the gold medal (55 kg). Her sister Babita Kumari won the silver (51 kg). I have seen inspirational life-affirming stories like this but what makes Dangal stands out from the multitude is that it got all the basics right. The film never sermonises the age old themes like sexism, gender inequality and patriotism, instead it hits the usual repertoire of greatest hits with a deft balance. There was never any need to hammer some of the ideas into your consciousness like nails to a wall. It trusts us to understand the issues because so many predecessors have already done so. It just presents them in a refreshing way to make them come up smelling like roses. For example, in a scene where the sisters lament their father for forcing them to learn wrestling, their friend who is a young bride-to-be shares with them how she wishes she has a father like theirs. In that simple monologue, a light is shone on the plight of the female gender in India. The film also got another aspect right - it manages to explain the sport with superb clarity, so much so that it almost feels like a wrestling 101 manual. It is never boring or preachy, and when the climax rolls in like the tide, you will smile gleefully because it has succeeded in actually making you feel smart. Talking about the climax, my wifey turned to me and whispered how the final bout would be won. I concurred and added that it will be underscored in extreme slow-mo. Of course, both of us were right. But the thing to remember is that even if we could guess it, it is always the mechanics behind we couldn't see. By then we were so vested in the story we were welcoming the final scene with opened arms and warm streaming tears. Dangal is also buoyed by convincing fight choreography and the wrestling sequences are well shot and without quick edits which are cheat-codes. You will believe the principals are wrestlers first and actors second. Fatima Sana Shaikh (Geeta) and Sanya Malhotra (Babita) are truly commendable in their roles. Even all the peripheral parts are well portrayed. That leaves Aamir Khan, who went over and above himself to turn in a superb performance and to think that he put on 38% body fat to play the role really made me want to salute him. But when I learned that he later went back to a lean mean fighting machine to play a much younger man in the initial part of the film, I wanted to bow down in front of the master. This is one powder keg of a movie with loads of great humour and infectious music. It doesn't matter that it is familiar because it feels like a great home-cooked meal and the Yoda-esque training lessons mirror what life throws at you. This one will definitely make you appreciate the sport that has been demonised and trivialised by WWF."
" Aamir Khan was amazing movie is just average
",0.5859,0.9103,2017-01-04 00:00:00,5,The performance of Aamir Khan in the movie is more than impressive. He is the best of Hollywood superstars; there is no scope left for disputes about that. Other than that the movie is full of melodrama and predictable twists. There is not a single scene in the movie that surprised me. It was all too predictable. The dramatization of the real incidents kind of made those totally different from the facts. Some light humour in the early part of the movie was impressive. Performance of the entire cast was exceeding expectations. The national anthem and patriotic scenes to the end of the movie sounded like an apology from Aamir for the stupid things he said last year. All in all the movie is a good watch and value for money. Nothing so great or must watch about it.
" Thumbs up for Dangal
",0.0,0.9826,2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"An American entertainer/comic actor, Late Andy Kaufman once said that "" there is no drama like wrestling"" and truly Aamir Khan and his team has cashed in this concept with 'Dangal'. There was not a single person without moist eyes as the curtains dropped in the theater. In one of the climax scene when the national anthem was played- many stood up (some with emotions and some due to peer pressure...) and applauded when one of the main protagonist wins the wrestling title. Dangal is based (partially) on a real life story of Mahavir Singh Phogat, who taught wrestling to his daughter, Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. Soundtrack of the movie is very earthy and so are the lyrics. Credits goes to the versatile Amitabh Bhattacharya who penned the beautiful songs and the music is composed by Pritam Chakraborty. The director (Nitesh Tiwari) and writer (Shreyas Jain) - without hammering the thought into the audience brain, beautifully pass on the message of gender equality and importance of hard work and patience.One of the main hero of the movie is the narrative style story telling and the acting of all the lead actors. This movie is worth a watch!! May this new year begins for all of us with the message that - There is no short cuts to success. You need to put in your blood and sweat in achieving your goals and have lot of patience to reach the summit in life."
" One of the rare feel good films in today's time
",0.4404,0.9814,2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"It is indeed very rare to find films of this nature in today's Bollywood cinema. A feel good film that is inspirational from which an individual and even the country can look upon. A film needs to have a strong story line to create an impact and DANGAL provided just that. The audience demands good story/script these days and are willing to watch a movie with strong script even if the actors are not well known. Sadly, there does exist some blind fans who blatantly makes other actors such as Salman Khan movies hit even if those don't have good story in it. DANGAL has strong story, great star cast and good performance. A must watch."
" Of wars, ringside and beyond
",-0.5574,0.9803,2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Mahavir Phogat leaves the sport at a point with some more to offer to it and some more to receive from it. This incomplete arc leaves a bitter taste on his soul, that just wouldn't go with the eflux of time. It just assumes another form; yearning. The yearning accrues into something bigger, a dream. A dream for a progeny- a son to complete his aspiration, carry his legacy forward. This dream keeps accruing in desperation through the birth of every daughter, till it comes to an eventual halt of acceptance at the birth of the fourth. He genuflects before destiny's hand in fashioning a future in a direction converse to his dream. A few years later, providence springs a surprise at him, in the form of his daughters. As it turns out, they're wrestlers too like their big man. This is enough for him to dust off his locked dream. And he goes after it like a marooned man at a wild boar. Redemption was all that he wanted- the elusive Olympic gold -and begetting a son was the means and not the end to it. Thus begins a fascinating journey of a father who goes on to live his dream vicariously through the achievements of his two daughters.Dangal is set in a patriarchal system we're so used to despising, just that instead of wrestling had it been cooking and if he was a cook and his ambition was to make it to Masterchef it wouldn't have gained the national veto of being an invigorating movie; especially for families with girl children. As graceful and ambitious as the man was, his underlying chauvinism cannot be ignored. Mahavir manipulates his dreams into theirs, his aspirations to theirs at an impressionable age. They become the monks who're forced into their renunciation to pursue his nirvana. There's something preposterous about sporting achievements- don't know about other countries, but definitely in this part of the world -that colours personal accolades as pride of a nation. Bigger the arena, bigger its subversion into patriotism. Any sport is a spectator event dependent on the emotional gullibility of its fan to thrive. So naturally when a nation is pitted against another at its behest, the similar bifurcation happens in the stands as well. Cheering for a sportsperson representing a nation blurs into national solidarity. For it is the most convenient display of patriotism unlike paying taxes and taking bullets.Can't remember the last time a lead man walked the screen, so naked of vanity to bring credence to a portrayal.There's a thin line that runs between egotism and mentoring, Aamir Khan's Phogat treads this with absolute precision bringing dignity,grace and empathy to a grumpy man who speaks economically, while constantly finding himself torn between taming his inner demons and his little devils on mud pitches. It's this ego he seeks validation of when he spars with his non abiding elder daughter. Her tresses are shoulder length, her manoeuvres revised. She's no longer the creature of his fashioning, his dreams have dissolved in her indulgences. Age doesn't blunt his resentment- even if it has managed to make his weary limbs, clumsily slow -as he continues to spar. She comes on top and he loses. But this isn't one of those vanilla tropes from mainstream films, where the after taste of a man's loss to his own child is sweet. The sight of a muddy old Phogat gasping for breath in humiliation as his elder daughter stands to taunt is anything, but that. Wrestling transcends beyond the pitch between the two.There's a scene where Phogat finds himself before a archaic table in a sports federation, he's there to seek funds to support the training of his daughters. The officer in front talks to him in haryanvi almost. Almost because majority of his mouth is in the service of grinding a mothi laddoo from a box he's received from the desperate man before him. He nonchalantly explains the paucity of funds with finger movements for neglected sports like wrestling, especially for women, mockingly. A frustrated Phogat begins to rant about why India fares poorly in the Olympics, when he's cut midway by the officer's abrupt exit for lunch.It is scenes like this that bring out the odds that were stacked against the real Phogat, the numerous fights he had to take outside the ring- with the condescending villagers, the purists of the game, a sporting system content of mediocrity -to get his daughters into it.It is a story which needed to be told. Dangal tells this story with utmost integrity without circumventing around its protagonist like a demigod. Unlike the Dhoni biopic, which felt like a litany of montages shot for Chivas Regal promotions than a movie, Dangal doesn't sidestep the grey shades of its central characters.It in fact for the most part keeps away from the temptation to celebrate them, instead tells a story that deserves to be celebrated. Even if not for the anthem that played in the final moments, I stood as the end credits began to roll, to doff my hat to- the movie, the people who made it and the ones it was made on. It is that kind of a movie that gets to you. Think it would to most, given the reception it got in the theatre I watched."
" Great film, but not for the reasons you might think
",0.3716,0.9912,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"A wrestler with potential and big dreams; to make the country he loved proud. Despite his best efforts he did not succeed but he did not give up. One day he aspired to have a son to follow his footsteps.He did get married but to his (pre-conceived) misfortune he had two daughters, thus leaving his dream of a son who would become a world class wrestler in tatters. Of course, this was to change when one day his daughters got involved in an altercation with a boy and ""properly"" punished him for misbehaving. This was his epiphany: the fact that he had daughters should not be an impediment to his lifelong dream of having a progeny that would end up being a champion.That was also the moment, the tragedy for his two daughters begun. Without any consideration for their wants or needs, he begun to groom them for a life of professional wrestling and international glory. Those girls were not asked or considered, they were forced since the only thing that mattered was daddy's dreams. The fact that they were robbed of their childhood was immaterial. Mahavir Singh Phogat just did not care; gold metal was on his mind.The girls grew up biologically but not emotionally; the fear and need for dad's approval never went away. Even as they progressed in the sports world all their strife was about pleasing dad. It never went away.This film is a brilliant portrayal of child abuse covered in success. A determined person with no resistance from a submissive spouse went on to take over the lives of his children and formed them in his own resemblance.Sure, there were successes. The girls became champions, won medals and some will say their father never stopped believing in them when in fact he never ceased to believe in his own sporting ambitions using his children as vehicle. He even buttress it as women's right going so far as to say ""no one should say a girl cannot do what a boy can do"" or ""they would have ended up housewives performing chores"". Anything to make himself feel better and justify the emotional robbery he performed on his children.A brilliant and highly poignant and emotional film, made me want to jump to the screen and rescue Geeta and Babita."
" Great movie !!, but with some Bollywood-ish masala.
",0.4826,0.9606,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Dangal is a biography of former National Wrestling champion Mahavir Singh Phogat. The performance by Aamir Khan is stellar and also the actors portraying both Geeta & Babita ( both young and mature) are par beyond excellence. But this movie like any other typical Bollywood movie plays with true incidents to introduce emotional content for grasping audience. Many incidents portrayed are not true if the context of biography should be taken into account. Ex- the climax where Aamir's character is cunningly locked in a room by Coach Sodhi, which actually never happened. This movie is not only a great entertainer but also showcases how sports and athletics is suffering in India due to backward attitude. It also shows a great deal about women empowerment. I wouldn't say its the best performance of Aamir, but definitely one of his best. A must watch for all."
" Dangal raises the bar so high!
",0.0,0.9796,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"There's no taking away from the actors, but the real stars here are the team of scriptwriters and the director. There is so much respect for the audience. The use of the voice over/narrator (I've hardly ever seen it in Hindi films) was a stroke of genius though its introduction was delayed and bit abrupt. The writing kept me engaged about a sport that I'm pretty sure most of those watching, like me, knew nothing about.The choreography, direction and editing, particularly of the last 45 minus led to silence in the theater, where there had been much-appreciated laughter and an emotional connect in the first half of the film. This is what a movie going experience should be - to educate, inform and inspire.It's established now that Aamir is bankable as a producer and bless him for his choice of material!"

Just the right sprinkling of humor, inspiring, well-cast, well-acted, well- paced, well-edited - an absolute joy to watch as the story played out to it's conclusion. The wrestling competition scenes by these young girls were the most believable and realistic sports-action scenes I've seen in ANY movie. Sound track was very good. Subtitles were short and not a distraction to viewing the film at all, and oddly seemed to add to the overall impact and success of the film.The few photos of the family who lived this story, as the credits rolled, were a delight. As depicted in this film, there are aspects of the Indian culture and family values that are worth emulating. New Years Day theater was packed. Thank you to AMC for making this limited release gem available at one of your theaters in our area (only one!!?). It deserves a much wider release."
" Sugar coated Regressive portrayal of feminine gender
",0.0,-0.7747,2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"I am aware that many people would not like to read my review. I have no doubt that the movie viewing experience with its emotional pot-boiler roller coaster ride engages and is a good one, better than the Indian, regional and vernacular soap-opera dished out on Indian television. (That is why I am giving 7 out of 10 rating)But if a sensitive person looks beyond the cosmetics of movie dazzles ‚Äì you will find someone is selling a regressive message through this film. Kodus to Dangal team for achieving such a feat. Here is my take..When the first poster of the movie was released I did not like it. Even though being a wrestler, why four girls should look like boys was the first question I raised.Now after reading so much appreciation and reviews of the movie I say this:¬ï This is another patriarchal portrayal of regressive India ¬ï A father forces his dreams on children. One should never do ¬ï Children should be kept free to develop and grow as they want ¬ï This is again patriarchy dominance on the feminine gender and forcing it with the power of parenting to subjugate the flourishing of women's gender. ¬ï For sure the flourishing of women's gender is not in imitating men and/or boys and becoming fighters, wrestlers and looking masculine. This is degrading the pride, dignity and respect of being a woman ¬ï To use a true success story of a single case and successfully use it as propaganda for women's emancipation is sickening to say the least. The negative fallout of this movie could be: ¬ï Irrespective of boys or girls many parents will force their children (and more so to girls) to do what they failed to achieve in life. Make their children do things that they as parents have dreamed. Sick mentality! ¬ï Many girls may start behaving like boys - wearing boys dress, cutting hair like boys, fighting like boys etc. etc. not at all in the spirit of humanism ¬ï Father in the movie saying that ""My girls are no less than boys"". Such comparisons are not needed in today's evolved society. This is a phrase of sixties India. It is similar to always call a girl ""Tom Boy"" and demean and insult her sexuality. Such comparisons just distort the femininity of girls and women, who mis-understand such statements as being treated like boys rather than girls ¬ï Addressing girls as a male gender and treating one like that - the society like India - parents may do that to destroy the little bit of remaining self-esteem that girls and women - have on their given gender and sexuality ¬ï I also am bothered - as I always tell everyone about it is MAN - in capitals that drive the so called women's emancipation and empowerment agenda - It is so disturbing to see this. The four writers of the movie are men, the director of the movie is wearing men's glasses, the so called super-star gender sensitive actor Amir Khan is too wearing a man's hat.¬ï In propaganda of spreading regressive message through this film the team too is of men - the director, writer, producer and lead actor - all men - who drive to influence the society in a way that may create a distorted image of what is meant by women empowerment. ¬ï In real life on which the movie is based the father of the wrestling girls drives their lives. Such case studies should have been presented more sensitively by showing ‚Äì such things need not be done ‚Äì even though in the end it brings laurels for the country. Though I agree the medium of cinema when used with shrewdness can garner enough emotions within ignorant movie goers about nationhood to back the protagonist in whatever s/he is doing. That is what has happened in this movie - the art of good film-making -tends to overlook and ignore finer aspects of women empowerment and digs more deep into the patriarchal systems to further strengthen patriarchal roles to build the women's liberation and freedom movement I hope some readers who are sensitive human being will try to understand the point I am making and deplore such popular presentation of regressive concepts on feminism despite its all-time record breaking All India Collection. It confirms my review - Indian is still a Patriarchal society with male dominance.Have a look at the film with those lenses."

Its cinematography is best from those Indian film I have seen. It's ahead to compete with ""Lagan"" and ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"". Aamir Khan is always hardworking and try to get perfection. Here child actress are excellent in performance. South Asian family emotion was not absent in movie. Game was too much thrilling... This is also best Biography movie in recent years like: ""Genius"", ""Machine Gun Preacher"". In my point this is best Biography movie after ""A Beautiful Mind""."
" Not as great as hyped!
",-0.5553,0.9445,2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"Though story is based on real life story, the movie fails to impress! I had a lot of expectations from the movie but was disappointed after watching it. The story is supposed to be about women wrestlers fighting against patriarchal society to win a gold medal. But in the movie, there is little to show that those girls were discriminated because they were girls! The movie would still be same if the protagonist were boys instead of girls (apart from a couple of dialogues)! There seems no struggle for phogat girls because they were girls! Many talk about this movie telling its patriotic! I fail to see there point! Patriotism is just a masala in the movie. Basically, Mahavir phogat wanted to win gold but failed, so he prepares his daughters for the win. Thats it! It's the dream of any sports person to win gold for the country and that is what is shown here! Thats it! Nothing different! Good thing about the movie is you won't get bored. There is a lot humour throughout the movie which keeps you entertained. Overall its just a one time watch."

" Not a sports movie - but a family movie
",0.0,0.9968,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"The leading actor Aamir Khan has already set me an exception before watching the movie. Impressive act. no doubt. Here the specialty of his act is that the impressive presentation by the director. I even forgot Aamir. I only found Mr. Mahavir Singh there. We only feel a coach there. Through Babita, we see the father there. But very rarely only we think that it is Aamir. that is an achievement of the team. Director, the actor and the stylist/physical trainer who made it possible. It is normally difficult to find strong emotional moments in a biopic kind of story. So how to exaggerate without deviating much from the actual situation is always a challenge. Then how to screen it in a natural way? With help of art directors can create the canvas. Surely the actual hero had passion. Then delivering that passion in frame is difficult task. The children did a good job here. I even doubted whether they can deliver it. In an Indian family father has a respect. whether all fathers give great things in return? that question is well asked and answered. Sing was just a villager. surely not that poor. But he had will to overcome that. It also show that Indian system, even anybody can blame it corrupted and bad. but a person with will can always overcome the hurdles. it is a motivating story for all fathers. Director has a magic of conveying emotion. As audience, we had moments where which we support certain characters and based on certain values, we wanted them to be defeated at certain points. These things are only understandable in an Indian context. i guess.if possible, we should watch the movie full family. children and parents. Fortunately i watched in that way. Really enjoyed.There are some points for improvements. like puma shoes are used in certain shots as Aamir wearing. Those small things are negligible compared to the grand output.

",0.6588,0.801,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Dangal is an emotionally made biographical tale that talks about a former National level wrestler who could not win a Gold medal for India due to his personal commitments but fulfills his wish by making his two daughters win medals at the Commonwealth Games. It is not the first time we are witnessing a film that speaks about a wrestler's life, but no matter how many films you might have watched, Dangal stands unique in a lot of ways. Director Nitesh Tiwari has to be credited for the way he has treated the film with not much force fitted theatrics yet grabbing the attention of the audience throughout the film. Yes, there were one or two dramatic moments which looked essential for the script and they were not overdone.Finally, we have a film that talks about the real struggle of a wrestler. How much they had to lose to win a medal for the nation? People who watch this film might never take wrestling as their profession, but one thing is for certain, the respect for the sport will undoubtedly increase. Aamir Khan hits it out of the park yet again with another emotional masterpiece!"
" Dangal justifies ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.""
",-0.128,0.98,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"After watching this movie, you understand this quote bit better. If we count the impediments faced by Mahavir phogat then it starts from so called ""Luck"" where he could not get boy and then his daughter themselves were not willing to purse such life. Not to mention opposition from wife, relatives, neighbors, friends, society, Coach itself. Wow, and he overpasses all of this to achieve what he dream of.Movie also gives a great message that there should be some Goal, dream to do something in life. Then only there is 'life' in life.We can actually feel the efforts being taken by every actor to justify their rolls and they have nailed it.This kind of movie should be watch in theater where you are fully concentrated and living the emotions, trouble of the character. Every time I listen the title song it gives so much power, encouragement to purse whatever task we are in it. Great efforts and hence ""Kamyabi jhak mar ke piche aayegi"" justified. Must watch that too in theater :)"
" Over-hyped by Patriots .. Average Movie......Nowhere near what everyone is making it out to be.
",0.0,0.9531,2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Story : Good Screenplay : Good Direction: Average Actors: All acted ordinarily except Aamir who was above average due to few heart touching scenes. Music: Effective/GoodToo much hype by patriots not knowing a good movie from a bad, who are simply echoing the same words uttered by the bollywood celebs for their friend Aamir. I felt the movie was very predictable with lots of scenes were altered from reality for entertainment purposes. Yes it has emotions, comedy, action etc. but is not a true movie at all except a few scenes such as fight sequences. I believe a lot of people are just going to watch this due to the word of mouth coming from other bollywood celebs promoting the movie left right and centre. The whole of India if not the world had more time at their hands due to the holiday season and everyone from marketing team to film producers, directors, actors, friends, media just went all out promoting this movie for Aamir and his production house and all they did is enjoyed people spending their hard earned moola on this average movie."
