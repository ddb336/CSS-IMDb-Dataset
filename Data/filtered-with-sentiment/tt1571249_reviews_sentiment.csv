" Comedy Actors Shine In Noteless Drama
",0.3612,-0.9953,2021-01-18 00:00:00,5,"Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig star as Milo and Maggie Dean in Craig Johnson's ""The Skeleton Twins."" Although these two ""Saturday Night Live"" veterans are known for their comedic talents, the film is only slightly a comedy. While ""The Skeleton Twins'"" casting and marketing suggested something humorous and heartwarming, the movie is a drama narrowing in on the quirky and troubled lives of two depressed siblings in their late thirties.The film sets its dark tone in the very first scene when Milo attempts suicide by slitting his wrists in a bathtub. In the next location, Maggie stoically contemplates swallowing a handful of pills over a bathroom sink. Only a phone call from the hospital interrupts her, informing her of her estranged brother's near-death experience. Reunited by tragedy after ten years apart, Milo moves in with Maggie in their upstate New York hometown. Together, they fight, learn, and grow from their sinister pasts.Hader and Wiig certainly deserve praise for their portrayals of such broken people. They both prove their dramatic chops here. Really all actors do good work in the film. Notably, Luke Wilson offers a wonderfully endearing performance as Maggie's simple-minded, but good-natured husband, Lance.However, the script can often teeter on sappy. From the suicide introduction to both of the twin's unsavory backstories, the movie deals with some heavy topics, and sometimes they become too heavy for the film's colorful tone. ""The Skeleton Twins"" carries the romantic energy of an autumn-set adult family dramedy, yet it caustically splices that energy with ultra-solemn themes.Meanwhile, despite Hader and Wiig's stellar performances, Milo and Maggie are far from relatable. Their issues (and their reactions to those issues) all seem over-the-top. Johnson reaches for the highest shelf of dramatic motifs all too hastily, pushing suicide, molestation, alcoholism, failed careers, failed marriages, and familial strife into two character arcs. Ultimately, the protagonists are so oversaturated with problems that it becomes difficult to feel for them.What's worse is that the Dean twins are not entirely likable. They may have undergone immense trauma, but the audience cannot help but see them as immature. Milo is clingy, prissy, and foolish, while Maggie is humorless and selfish. Lance ends up being the only character offering any redemption, but Milo treats him like a dolt as Maggie takes advantage of his goodwill.In the beginning, I rooted for these unconventional heroes, but by the ending, they just exhausted me. Perhaps Johnson intended for this reaction, as mental health issues are indeed constant unflattering fights for victims and their families. As a film, however, ""The Skeleton Twins"" suffers from tonal inconsistency and tiresome characters, creating an aura of forgettability."
" This is the best feel good-bad movie
",0.6369,0.954,2021-01-17 00:00:00,9,"I loved this film. It is a really genuine feeling movie about how life gets in the way some times, and how we need each other to get through it. Some scenes felt so real and raw, that I couldn't help relate to it at some points. Yes, and there a plenty of laughs and feel good moments to be had, and the movie succeeds in both aspects. Good movie."
" slow and pretentious
",0.0,0.8516,2021-01-08 00:00:00,1,"Good acting, screenwriting, maybe. The story, nonsense.
It would be a more enjoyable movie, if both characters succeed in doing what they desire to do."
" It felt real
",0.0,0.9904,2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"I've seen so many sentimental comedies, that it's hard for me to find a truly original story. This one is no exception: apart from the ""twins"" idea, it resembles other stories about family relationships I've already seen before.
But who cares: the script is wonderfully written, without smudges, and it tackles serious issues with taste. No character is a parody. And the actors are so brilliant and into their characters, that you can suspend your disbelief for an hour and a half.
I truly hope I'll see Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig together again, and I hope Luke Wilson will also get the recognition he deserves.Just brilliant. I bought the DVD, to watch it again in its original version."
" Not bad at all
",0.431,0.552,2020-07-30 00:00:00,7,"This is a very offbeat dark comedy that deals with interesting and very real true life problems. This has a unique story with a fantastic cast and very indepth charismatic characters.The things I didn't like without spoiling is the cheating and some harsh actions/words that in my opinion did not add to the character relations or viewer pleasure. The characters seem like real ass wipes then lovely and funny the next scene.Some sub plots or plot directions are hard to follow. And there isn't any help or heart warming moments either of the twins should of received.Overall:
This was a great dark comedy that is something unique. This isn't for everyone but I found it pretty damn enjoyable. I would reccomend this is your not too sensitive over suicidal topics."
" Love Wiig and Hader.
",0.6369,0.5994,2020-06-13 00:00:00,8,Loved Wiig and Hader together and the emotion depth they brought to their characters.
" Great actors, sloppy story
",0.6249,0.4197,2020-06-07 00:00:00,5,"I love both Hader and Wiig and they predictably do excellent dramatic work here. Plus their sibling relationship is especially credible knowing their work history. The trouble is that the story is a hodge-podge of issues, at least one downright upsetting, and most of them are never really brought to resolution, just kind of hung out as strands in the story. strands which are never tied tight. Some of the more dramatic turning points feel so schematic and what passes for a denouement really feels like no more than a moment. Gratuitously destructive behavior is never really justified, only used to forward the plot. It's just not a well-constructed story. Can't fault the leads though; I just wish they had a more solid vehicle."
" Skeleton twins
",0.0,0.9371,2020-04-23 00:00:00,7,"A great twisted comedy /drama and a great cast.
Bill hader and christina Wiig are excellent."
" These are not the twins you were looking for
",0.0,0.9535,2020-04-23 00:00:00,4,"Okay, but depressing watch, not planning on watching again, and can't really recommend.I'm not saying that comedic actors can't do dramatic roles, or that Bill Hader can't play gay, or that you can't have suicide in your movie or even a comedy. What I will say is that a movie about depression and suicide is VERY hard to make enjoyable, let alone funny, even with hilarious actors.Even if this isn't supposed to be a comedy, there is a slew of scenes that are clearly supposed to be somewhat humorous. I suppose there is something masterful about bringing the audience up to drag them to the depths, but it is not an experience I necessarily was seeking.This may work for you, it's well written, performed, and produced, but its just not my flavor."
" Bizarrely terrible
",-0.4767,-0.2294,2020-03-27 00:00:00,1,"I'm very curious to know why this movie cast Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, the funniest actors play such depressing, boring characters. The movie is not funny at all. It however teaches a novel method of suicide."
" Mixed Emos
",0.0,-0.9697,2020-03-09 00:00:00,8,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. It's one of my favorites - but not because I think it should win any awards or expect anyone else to love it.I find it to be a pretty revealing look at mental illness from a mentally ill person's perspective. The view we are given of the twins is confusing, self indulgent, and frustrating. It's obvious that they don't want help from outside sources and even the help they find from each other is resisted. It's difficult to get to the bottom of their issues not because the film is bad but because they themselves cannot find it.As a person that has dealt with both mental illness and abuse issues, I identify with the twins struggle to pinpoint the bad of their struggles when every day life feels daunting. As the audience, I felt confused and frustrated. I felt like the characters around Wiig & Hader were a lot of noise and didn't offer much help... and at times I just wanted it to end. I was left with the feeling that the movie was trying to show the audience what mental illness felt like. Which isn't a good feeling... so personally it felt like a misunderstood success. Not that I think it's perfect. But a decent attempt at a near impossible feat."
" It's an OK movie
",0.4466,0.7867,2020-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Pretty average movie, nothing crazy.I just wanna say one thing,*SPOILER*what happened to Lance? He was without a doubt the best character and we never see him again after he finds out about the birth control. Honestly I feel like if we found out what happened with Lance this would've been a much more satisfying movie. I feel unfulfilled."
" Extraordinary chemistry between the cast
",0.0,0.4648,2020-02-25 00:00:00,9,"This is an A+ dramedy! The chemistry, the script, the composition so well done. Watching it for the first time in 2020, and it holds up for sureeee"
" that was cute
",0.4588,0.8777,2020-02-01 00:00:00,8,"No masterpiece here, just a really nice heart-touching story and some great acting."
" Beautiful and accurate portrayal of a sibling relationship
",0.5994,0.9742,2020-01-30 00:00:00,9,"I think many people may find this film hard to relate to, but for the people who do it will really strike true. The sibling dynamic really reminded me of my own relationship with my brother--from the mouthing song lyrics to random poking to putting makeup on him to strange jokes/characters that don't make sense to anyone else. I've never seen a film that so accurately portrayed that type of relationship. Bill Hader was exceptional, with a subtle and nuanced performance (but then again I think he's great in everything he does). Kristen Wiig was also fantastic, and their chemistry really brought life to the film.I think people who relate to the things the film deals with (depression, sibling relationships, dysfunctional family) will really love this movie, while those who can't see themselves reflected in any of the characters or situations might get less out of it. But so it goes for most movies, I suppose."
" Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig... enough said
",0.0,0.9882,2020-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I am on Kristen Wiig fever for two weeks now wondering how I haven't got to know her career before and now I make up for all that I have missed out. So I spend my late nights googling out her movies, and watch all of them, a movie on each night.This was the first movie of her that I have watched and was totally surprised that after all the comical sketches she did back in SNL she had this really powerful dramatic side in her, she is indeed one of her kinds, a fantastic actress. Not to mention with Bill Hader, who also plays usually in comedies brought his dramatic self also, and these two together are just a delight to watch, the chemistry between them works perfectly, they could do anything together and would be an experience to see.The story is captivating, it depicts the mundane, everyday life of suburbian people with dark comedy and really good laughs mixed with the cold realism of depression and self-hate in general. These are not normal people and the story perfectly reflects on that with its slowly building up narrative. It's a drama, it's a dark comedy, it has... it's real life scent to it all over. As I am getting older I kinda find these independent, more silent dramas more and more important to see, they tell stories that just have the quality of holding up a mirror in front of you, and just... give you some perspective about your own life in general, that are you really doing everything in order to feel... alive and... complete? Because that's the question I have at every Kristen movies each...I'm glad that I have this Kristen Wiig fever, because these latest weeks were one of the best experiences in my almost totally miserable life at the age of 28 as a young lad spending his last 10 years mostly in fear and passiveness. Just watch all of her movies, you seriously need them, whatever life you have!"
" The Skeleton Twins (2014)
",0.0,-0.7852,2020-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Directed by Craig Johnson. Starring Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, Luke Wilson, Ty Burrell, Boyd Holbrook, Joanna Gleason, Kathleen Rose Perkins, Adriane Lenox. (R)Once-inseparable twins Wiig and Hader have grown apart in the last decade, but after one attempts suicide (and the other is on the verge of the same), they reunite and rekindle their relationship, unearthing uncomfortable secrets and baggage along the way. Off-kilter comedy with a heavy dose of pain and sadness; screenwriters Craig Johnson and Mark Heyman navigate recognizable territory throughout, and its more a series of episodes and interactions than a substantive narrative (with a tidy ending that relies too much on implausibly perfect timing), but those episodes and interactions are often quite special. Hader and Wiig both do sublime work, waspish but vulnerable; hilarity was expected, tenderness as well (thanks to a friendship formed after years of working together on ""Saturday Night Live"" and other films), but they also nail the weight of the depression and anxiety moments. Even manages the seemingly impossible feat of featuring an extended scene set to Starship's ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" that demands to be watched again and again.82/100"
" Heartwarming and a surprise hit!!
",0.6988,0.915,2019-11-06 00:00:00,10,Wiig and Hader are a perfect combo in any genre!! I loved there performances and this film deserved more recognition than what they got. Definitely worth watching
" Great moments
",0.6249,0.9136,2019-06-29 00:00:00,9,"There s a heartfelt and also comedic feeling to this very real film about imperfect oeople. The lip sync scene with Hader and Wiig is worth seeing. Just like they did in SNL. Don't listen to the negative reviews. We all know people like this or are people like this. . It's truly heartfekt, warm, funny and sad."
" I love this movie
",0.6369,0.9882,2018-11-26 00:00:00,10,I may be biased somehow but I just absolutely love this movie. It's definitely a dark indie comedy so not the constant happy comedy that may be expected with Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader but their chemistry is just undeniable. Everything about this and their performance playing twins reuniting under less than perfect circumstances is just so real and human that it's hard to not feel every emotion that they're portraying. This one is probably not for everyone expecting a straight SNL-type comedy but it genuinely feels like Bill and Kristen as their true selves hanging out in real life in between the strong structure of the story.
" Out of their element, and...
",0.0,0.9823,2018-10-07 00:00:00,9,"Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader are incredibly talented comedic actors. This is such a different path for both of them to take and they have exceeded expectations. This story is about the difficulties we face with people we love and how our screw-ups in life help us to lean on those we love and trust the most. It's an honest, funny and heartwarming movie that is a must see."
" Love the acting
",0.6369,0.9275,2018-09-21 00:00:00,9,Well...it's about suicide...There are funny parts and really sad parts. The acting is really interesting and good. The story is a little abstract but I did really like it. The lip sync performance is really great.
" Fraternal love of two twins who face the disappointments of a difficult life
",-0.0772,0.9693,2018-05-11 00:00:00,7,"A truly discreet dramatic comedy that with great depth and at the same time intimacy, digs into a particular relationship between two twins linked by the same childhood almost totally conditioned by a present and affectionate but at the same time very sad father who concluded early his life with a suicide that has greatly influenced the past but also the present of his two sons.
Twins at the same time so different yet so similar and bound by a strong and extremely credible and deep brotherly love, similar also in the kind of life, an unsatisfactory, melancholy life where something is missing enough to bring both to attempt suicide just like their father had done before them to look for an escape from the disappointments and injustices of life.
A relationship that has suffered from a distance that lasted more than ten years but perhaps it is the only thing that can complete their life and that can make them move forward together.
One of the biggest surprises of the film is precisely the interpretations of the two protagonists, Kristen Wiig who proves to be unexpectedly talented even in dramatic roles and an extraordinary Bill Hader that represents the soul of the film thanks to its performance in perfect harmony with its charismatic and complexed character.
What is missing from the film is a more incisive personality and a better beat and amalgamated rhythm that would have helped especially to make it more engaging and less heavy, in any case manages to convey a variety of emotions thanks to many scenes that I will hardly forget because of their really strong emotional impact."
" Always Enthralling
",0.0,0.25,2018-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Intelligent, well-acted relationship drama. Ended suddenly, for me. Always enthralling. Maybe stretched the limits at times but a lot had to be covered in a relatively short time."
" An interesting look at depression and sibling love
",0.4939,-0.4119,2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'The Skeleton Twins' certainly sounds ominous and depressing from the title and the fact that both siblings, Milo (Hader) & Maggie (Wiig) try to commit suicide within the first 10min of the film - but it's actually not too bleak and has a lot of funny moments throughout.There's definitely some heavy issues the twins discuss/contemplate - cheating, death of a parent, unsupportive other parent, job/money issues - but once they reconnect, they bounce off each other in a very enjoyable-to-watch way, particularly the miming of the Starship song. Quite a few witty remarks throughout and it's not too long at less than 100min.Wilson is good as the too-caring/energetic husband of Maggie's and Burrell is OK as the forbidden ex-boyfriend of Milo's, but it really is the two leads that carry the film and make you invest in them and their decisions. The ending is ultimately uplifting and appropriate."
" Awful Twins
",-0.4588,-0.9884,2017-10-26 00:00:00,3,"I hate this film. To begin with, the titular twins are such a lame and offensive fools that is so so selfishly unaware of every one around them. To make matters worse, the story is no help. It never really show any well-rounded character except the twins that when everyone is gone, you could not care even less to whatever resolution would happen to them. And the most awful part, they try to diffuse these problems of that already awful story with so unfunny and very unnecessary sketches that bugs the overall dark mood of the film. It just meshes it into a big pile of uneven stretches that is kinda uncomfortable to watch. Kinda reminds me of 80's John Hughes , where he writes a film with his ultra-stereotypes character(that always bugs me to my core) and add annoying tropes to fill the empty void.Overall, Skeleton Twins is a pretty awful. It tries to much to impress that it kinda misses it point of self-reflection.Clearly, NOT worth your time [1.5/5]"
" Not the Wiig and Hader comedy you were expecting, but they make this movie work
",0.1901,0.9162,2017-07-02 00:00:00,7,"A film starring Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader that's about battling past demons, fighting against destructive behavior patterns, depression and suicide — the ""The Skeleton Twins"" will surely confuse and frustrate a lot of comedy fans. Those prepared for or open to something different will find Craig Johnson's film an honest and stirring look at adult struggles.If not for a couple noteworthy improvised scenes, someone unfamiliar with Wiig and Hader would not assume these two were season sketch comedy veterans from ""Saturday Night Live."" They say comedy comes from a dark place, and perhaps — counter to what viewers might expect from funny people — this is precisely why they settle rather effortlessly into the roles of Maggie and Milo Dean, and the ebb and flow of humorous tones to serious ones feels natural.We are often conditioned to compartmentalize suicide with drama and seriousness, and those who have never considered the dual nature of depression will probably come out of ""Skeleton Twins"" feeling it was uncomfortable and awkward. The fact that these characters could have fun at all during the film after the first two scenes show an attempted and considered suicide by both leads seems unnatural. For others, Johnson and co-writer Mark Heyman's story will seem more true to life, that the lows and highs, humor and deep vulnerability and coexist in this way.At the film's core is a brother-sister relationship. When Milo attempts suicide, the hospital notifies Maggie, though the two haven't spoken in 10 years. Maggie has Milo come live with her and her husband (Luke Wilson) in the town they grew up in, at least until he can get back in the right place. Their reunion, however, brings out some secrets and issues Maggie has been avoiding, and the two must reconcile the fact that they are both good and bad for each other.The plot works through a number of subplots familiar to independent films of this ilk, which can at times keep things sluggish: Maggie has the hots for her SCUBA instructor while Milo reconnects with a former teacher with whom he had an illicit relationship. These story lines have predictable outcomes, though they do serve the characters well in forcing them to look at their deeper issues.Scenes like the dentist office and an entire karaoke routine to Starship's ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" provide needed reprieve from the weightiness of the subject matter, though regrettably they became too much of a focal point of the marketing for the film. Someone figured better to dupe audiences and make a little cash than be forthright about the film's predominantly somber, introspective tone (hence the film's less than favorable popularity ratings). There is a lot of deadpan humor to start, but this is a decisively dramatic film.""The Skeleton Twins"" certainly could have been more original in its story and ideas, and the narrative could have been more driven by something other than just Maggie and Milo's ambiguous day to day ups and downs as they deal with their new living situation and later on the fallout from their secrets. However, the character development and dynamics end up sufficiently carrying the weight. Wiig and Hader have long had great comedic chemistry, and it appears to be easily transferable to other genres as evidenced here. Whenever the film gets weighty or stiff, they loosen it up and imbue it with a freshness that makes it worthwhile.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
" Must see
",0.0,0.9967,2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Lovely movie!How come I hardly heard of this movie? It is now 2017 and I just now 'discovered' this film. It is a beautiful movie with real, honest heartfelt characters. Hilarious funny at times, emotionally funny many more times and emotionally serious in between. But it never gets too heavy. The humour makes we can dive into some heavy topics without us all going really down with it. You start to feel for all the characters: beautiful, honest three dimensional people. Some reviewer was nagging about too heavy symbolism. It is not too heavy. It is present but you can ignore it totally if you want. A beautiful, well crafted, well acted, well directed, well edited and with some nice cool music. Loved the scene were the two main characters playback 'Nothing's gonna stop us now' by Starship. We all have been young, we all have secrets, we all become adults we all live our lives amidst relationships. This movie tells this story with lots of love, emotional intelligence and integrity. And lots of humour. A movie you can re-watch every so time. Goes into my favourite list."
" Great dramatic performances from comedy actors
",0.765,0.9987,2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"'Skeleton Twins' is directed and co-written (together with Mark Heyman) by Craig Johnson. The movie follows the story of twins, played by Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who are reunited after a 10-year period of not talking to each other. The reason for this reunion is the failed suicide attempt by Bill Hader's character, Milo. His twin sister Maggie decides to take him in to look after him but it's clear that she isn't even able to take care of herself. The movie opens with the suicide attempt by Milo, ready to slit his wrists and Maggie, ready to overdose on pills. Milo's failure results in Maggie's failure, because the hospital calls her up informing about her brother's radical decision, which prevents her from taking the pills. We as a viewer are the only ones who know about Maggie's failed attempt, which makes her character interesting to follow. The contrast between what she says and obviously (to us) feels elevates the dialogue and her relation with both her brother and her husband Lance, played by Luke Wilson. The cast in this comedy-drama is superb. The drama clearly outweighs the comedy in this picture, and therefore it's interesting to see how Craig Johnson opted for actors you usually see in pure comedies or even Saturday Night Live. It did pay off however, the entire cast was superb. Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader had an amazing chemistry - they both worked together on SNL – and were credible as twins. Maybe less credible as twins who hadn't seen each other in 10 years, because it felt as if they had never been apart. Luke Wilson and Ty Burrell (Modern Family) gave amazing performances as well. Wilson was great in both the comedic scenes and dramatic scenes. Ty Burrell played surprisingly a very restrained, serious character and delivered in every scene he was in. As I said, the drama outweighs the comedy in this one. There are some funny scenes but the themes the movie touched upon were quite heavy. Suicide and what comes after if you live is the main theme in this movie and this isn't the one you usually make jokes about. Craig Johnson looked more for comic relief in his characters than in this main theme, the comedy didn't go the dark way thus. Nothing wrong with dark comedy about sensitive, heavy topics however, '50/50' succeeded in making tasteful jokes about cancer and dealing with the disease. The characters are vital to the movie. Without you caring about them, this movie will bore you out of your mind. Craig Johnson succeeds at making you care about the characters, which makes the dramatic moments even more powerful. However, as the movie progressed, the movie didn't always get my full attention. The characters didn't develop throughout the movie, stayed more or less the same. When your story depends this much on your characters, it would be beneficial to the movie to have a story or character arch. The movie didn't and luckily the performances and comedic relief were good enough to save the movie from becoming boring.'Skeleton Twins' is a sweet movie about suicide, family, impermissible relations, with great performances. Don't expect a laugh out loud comedy, this is a drama with some subtle comedic tones."
