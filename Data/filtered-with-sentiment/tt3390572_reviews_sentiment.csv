It is a masterpiece
Hats off to Vishal Bhardwaj to make such a wonderful movie
I never expected that the movie would have such a great story
Shahid Kapoor's acting was the biggest positive about this movie
The supporting cast's acting was also very good
I was shocked that this type of movie is also made in Bollywood.
The ending was very emotional.
In short I would say that it is a masterpiece and deserves OSCAR"

This is the trend which is openly vouched by so called bollywood openly. Movie is shown only one side of coin story.

Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Kay Kay Menon stands out as usual for their out and out performances. It is a wonderful movie how the lies and betrayal plays out the leading character. Shraddha Kapoor will leave you in tears and Shahid Kapoor makes sure of that. Kudos to Shahid he really did a very good job. You feel for Shahid throughout the movie his fight for finding answers does become your fight. The everyday struggle in Kashmir is really shown well.
Some movies came ahead of time may be this one is such a movie. It didn't get it's due."
" Chutzpah in its painfully longest form filled with one sided twisted view!!!
",-0.6458,-0.5227,2020-08-01 00:00:00,1,"I felt terribly sad after watching this movie. Why? Well this movie is so terrible, like from story, to monotonous scenes, not to mention that movie is painfully slow. Indian army has been portrayed as evil and Kashmiri militants are being painted as heroes wanting free Kashmir. Well truth is that there is no Kashmir, and these militants want a Kashmir free from Indians and want to merge with Pakistan. Sad fact is that even Pakistan won't give them freedom because Kashmir cannot be free. Glad that Special status has been withdrawn and in a few years Kashmir will become normal like other Indian states. Jail hind!"

" This cinema is biased
",-0.2732,-0.9764,2020-07-22 00:00:00,1,In this film they say police and military personnel as killer and tourchurers. And they openly say India must give freedom to kashmir. And they show police and military informers as villains. But in real life they are saving thousands of people and soldiers life. This movie is spreading wrong information about kashmir. In reality army is trying to eradicate terrorism in Kashmir. In climax Tabu becomes sabotager this message is wrong and this can influence thousands of people. Please don't to this kind of film dividing India. And they say kashmir people are living in prison. But they not. Because some people inside kashmir supporting terrorism so forces are trying to neutralize them. Believe me in some years kashmir will bloom. And become Switzerland of India.

A faithfully complex modern rendering of Hamlet, exploring the terrifying psychology of vengeance, guilt & forgiveness. However, that description doesn't do justice to how urgent the film is. Kapoor, who's like an Indian Tom Hardy, gives a lead performance for the ages, commanding every moment he's on screen, a screen filled with strikingly crisp & harrowing visuals."

" The 3rd in a Trilogy of Shakespearean plays remade to fit into an Indian setting by a director who we hope will keep making more of them.
",0.7506,0.9748,2020-05-25 00:00:00,10,"Rewatched probably the most epic recreation of Hamlet, christened Haider (2014) set in Kashmir amid the conflict.This is the very genius of Vishal Bharadwaj who can reinterpret Shakespearean work in a setting even deeper than the Bard himself. The characters, the plot, the visuals and even the last few songs drag the viewer deeper into the ethos of the misery while the original story of Hamlet that I always admired pales in comparison. Those who are familiar with the director's work must be praying Mr. Bharadwaj continues to remake more of Shakespeare's work interpreted in his own unique story telling style which poignantly brings to light the very real ground situations in India while leaving the viewer to make his/her own judgement.Brilliant performances by Shahid Kapoor, Tabu, KK Menon and the late Irrfan Khan (who is sorely missed). This is the power of such story telling and direction that the real actors in Bollywood gravitate to do the bidding of such a scholarly director who also writes parts of the screenplay the lyrics and produces these films for the glory of art rather than any commercial interest.I actually feel bad for those who don't understand Hindi or Urdu to understand the native dialect and consume the story as is. While raw in its portrayal of Kashmir it is probably one of the most refined pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Now before you go about learning a new language to enjoy this film, there are subtitles that will still render the movie well worth your time if you enjoy critically acclaimed cinema delivered not just with passion but with a purpose!P.S. the film is long as the story is built in the first half you may think the beautiful visuals of Kashmir are in itself enough to watch the film, but hold on to your seats for the thrilling end that reveals a deeper message on freedom."
" The background
",0.0,0.6652,2020-05-21 00:00:00,6,"It turned out to be not a film depicting the plight of the Kashmiris but rather a retelling of Hamlet with the beautiful Kashmir in the background the internal squabble as the country as its backdrop. Even though the movie makes it appear as though there is just bloodshed, guns and terrorism in this snow-covered paradise on earth, much of its past history remains untold.People tend to assume Kashmir had always been a Muslim majority country where India is trying to exert its influence, but its citizens want out. There are much more than meets the eye.Kashmir was a revered place from time immemorial for seekers of knowledge and epistemology. It was the destination for many sages the world over. Hinduism, Shiva Taitrism, planted itself firmly here as early as 3rd century BCE. The populace was considered highly literate and skilled. The turning point came in the form of invaders. A particularly Muslim ruler by the name of Sikander Bhutshikan (1394-1417), an iconoclast, was hellbent on destroying non-Islamic symbols and enforced widespread proselytisation. Naturally, the Hindu Pandits escaped in droves to other parts of India and Kashmir became a Muslim-dominant country. Many Hindus remain closeted, only outwardly Muslims.King Ranjit Singh united Punjab, Afghanistan, Kashmir all the way to Tibet, but his successors lost Jammu and Kashmir to the East India Company in the first Anglo-British War in 1846. The British started the Hindu Dogra dynasty. It was Hari Singh, its descendant, who was the King of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 who decided to join neither India nor Pakistan. It stood an Independent sovereign state.Trouble started soon after Independence. Pakistani troops masquerading as Pashtun tribal groups infiltrated into Kashmir to take over the country. The 1st Indo-Pak war started when Maharajah Hari Singh asked for help and agreed for ascension into the Indian Dominion. The battle, however, ended in a deadlock with India controlling a third of the country and Pakistan the other third.Sheikh Abdullah was appointed the head of Jammu and Kashmir by Nehru. He had earlier led a rebellion against Hari Singh was had been imprisoned before. Sheikh ruled the state with special powers accorded to him via Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. His reign was marred with many insurgencies, Islamisation pogroms and terrorist activities with help from Pakistan. There were hardly any economic activities or development, but only a high tension volatile environment. More Sikhs and Hindus exited from their ancestral land seeking a better life since the 1980s.Many talented writers now settled elsewhere, have penned their doggone experiences in Kashmir in many of their heart-wrenching writing set in their once serene homeland. With the aberration of Article 370, India hopes to bring development and a semblance of peace in the region. Unfortunately, foreign media keeps stirring undue tension and anxiety amongst the people of the area to keep up their sales."

" A MASTERPIECE ! A MUST WATCH !!
",0.7723,-0.9798,2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"Haider is the third offering of Vishal Bharadwaj's trilogy of Shakespearean tragedies which included Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello). For his final instalment, he adapts what is perhaps the most challenging of the three, viz. Hamlet and sets it amidst an equally challenging setting of the restless paradise of earth, Kashmir, circa, 1995. Its brilliance lies in the successful juxtaposition of various strands of portent conflicts across several planes which belie any solution - those within, inter-personal as well as the smouldering geo-political conflicts - to find common grounds therein.Haider (Shahid Kapoor), a student and poet studying in Aligarh has to hurry to his home in the valley when he receives the news of an army crackdown that destroys his home and also results in the disappearance of his father, Dr.Hilal Meer (Narendra Jha), who was taken into custody by the army for harbouring militants. However, on returning home, he is distraught to find little remorse of the disappearance in his mother Ghazala (Tabu) who appears to be settling down quite well with Khurram (Kay Kay Menon), Haider's uncle and his fathers only brother. Haider sets out on a mission to find his father and unravel the mystery surrounding his disappearance. He is assisted in his quest by his childhood sweetheart and local journalist, Arshia (Shraddha Kapoor). The gentle canter of the plot finds momentum at the halfway mark with the arrival of the mysterious and almost ghostly Roohdaar (Irrfan) who contacts Haider. When he discovers the fate of his father, Haider is consumed by rage and obsessed with revenge.The movie sets a gradual pace through the first half to familiarise the viewers with the simmering situation situation in the valley where the daily living is punctuated by overnight curfews, frequent crackdowns, constant fear of living in the shadow of gunfire, a deep-seated dread of being included in the growing lists of those who have disappeared and a security blanket which choked the life out of this paradise. Vishal Bharadwaj and his co-writer Bhasharat Peer cast an unflinching eye on the valley when the insurgency was active to bring us the images which feel very real.Haider gains immensly from its excellent star cast who provide superlative performances in their roles. Shahid Kapoor brings in his best performance till date to capture a very difficult part of Haider (Hamlet) which oscillates across multiple dimensions of love, loneliness, desperation, sorrow, seething rage to seek revenge, subtle hints of Oedipal complex and being on the threshold of lunacy. He has a simmering presence and emotes well in scenes with minimal dialogue even while nailing those where he morphs into an impromptu performer as in the 'Mike Testing....' sequence. Kay Kay Menon aces the role of Khurram (Claudius) who is devious in seeking recognition and power, yet not entirely lacking in warmth. But, Haider's best performance comes from Tabu who plays Ghazala (Gertrude). She plays a complex role which is mired in mystery; a woman whose heart seems tri-sected between the three men in her life - Dr. Hilal Meer, her husband, Khurram, her brother-in-law and Haider, her son. Or, is she just another helpless woman victim in a valley beset with violence, where survival is at a premium and it is only natural that if you survive the bombing of your home, you just jump into the nearest bomb shelter to preserve your self ? There are moments where she appears to drop her guard and lets her vulnerability seep through as in some of her conversations with Haider. Shraddha Kapoor is radiant as Arshia (Ophelia) who is smitten with Haider and tries to assist him in finding his father.Vishal Bharadwaj also adds memorable minor parts, be it Irffan playing the ghostly Roohdaar who sets the plot into motion or Narendra Jha who effectively underplays his part of Dr. Hilal Meer or the duo (Sumit Kaul & Rajat Bhagat) who play Salman and Salman bringing some stray comic relief in an otherwise grim tale or even the elderly grave diggers.Vishal Bharadwaj appears to be an auteur in fine form here as he morphs his world famous source and transplants it to to the troubled landscape of Kashmir to achieve dual goals of narrating a poignant tragedy even as he makes a hard hitting political commentary of a festering wound that continues to consume and singe many a lives without any signs of healing. He and his co-writer Peer capture the insecurities, distrust, anguish and phenomenal sense of loss which permeate the psyche of generations of residents of what was once a paradise on earth as in the scene where Peer himself displays the deep seated scars of a population living in perennial fear. The beautiful, yet desolate images of the snowy landscapes captured by cinematographer Pankaj Kumar combine effectively with the dialogues, haunting background score and Gulzar's lyrics set to Vishal's tunes to present the mutation of this paradise into a morbid hell for its residents. In fact, Tabu's character of Ghazala could as well be seen as a metaphor for the valley itself which is caught between its allegiance between two blood brothers, shrouded in a mysterious veil of apparent self preservation only to let the vulnerabilities show in a few moments when she reaches out to her son affectionately and protectively. While the picture presents a political commentary that need not be entirely neutral, the essence of the commentary tends to abhor violence for any reason.This is a tour de force in film making as Vishal Bharadwaj marshals his entire arsenal - a fine adaptation, stellar star cast acing well fleshed out characters, superb writing, bewitching cinematography, soulful score and music and much more - to make the boldest political movie of our times to stress that revenge merely begets revenge and can never be a path to seek freedom.Yes, the movie does have its fair share of flaws - a languid pace, for one - just as its characters do.. Yet, just as its characters shine through their flaws, the movie too soars to hitherto uncharted trails.Intense, grim, dense and somber, Haider may not be a movie that would suit everyone's palette, especially those who are faint of heart and yet, if, ""To watch, or, Not to Watch"" is your question, ""Steel yourself and don't miss this MUST WATCH which would haunt you long after you've watched it"" is my most definitive answer."

Adapted from the play Hamlet by Shakespeare brings out the sensitive topic of militants in kashmir and politics around them. It revolves around the boy haider after he comes back to his hometown and faces the situation that turns him into something which he had never expected.

" Bollywood form of Shakespear plays-add to ur knowledge.
",0.0,0.9909,2018-08-22 00:00:00,7,"Most of the credit or praise associated with the movie goes to the movie director Vishal Bhardwaj. He has adopted some of the plays penned down by William Shakespear without losing its appeal. To be frank he has only added to its charm. His adoptions include Haider from Hamlet, Omkara from Othello and last but not the least Maqbool from Macbeth.Tone, Script & Story: See storyline from IMDb. It's nice to know that tension in Kashmir has reduced and the tourism has been fruitfully increased.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: As mentioned earlier they are of optimum quality. The hills, mountains, snow, river and associated add-ons add to its beauty. Music: Good. Bismil excels with its choreography. Acting: Shahid is worth mentioning. Others are good too.Final Verdict: It's good to see the bollywood version as I am not interested in reading books (written plays). It adds to ones knowledge. Worth watching for mentioned reason or even if you are fan of original plays."
" An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.
",-0.4019,0.9052,2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,It is the last film of Vishal Bharadwaj's Shakespearian trilogy and the most ambitious one. In the first two films (Maqbool and Omkara) the focus was on the plays and adapting it in an Indian backdrop. But in this film the focus was on Kashmir and it's complicated relationships with India. The play is integrated into the conflict. In Hamlet in the end everyone dies and so in the Kashmir conflict everyone loses as the situation has reached a stalemate. The film if taken on it's own merits is a bit slow paced and the acting by KK Menon and Shahid Kapoor is not always convincing. But when the play is added to the equation it makes more sense. It's a ambitious project and Vishal Bharadwaj pulls it off more or less.
" Blood-curdling Masterpiece
",0.6249,-0.9882,2018-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Vishal Bhardhwaj's magnum opus.
Like Omkara's dark horses,Saif Ali Khan & Deepak Dobriyal : Haider has its very own dark horse - Kay Kay Menon & his gripping rendition of Khurram Meer / King Claudius.Bhardwaj has interestingly adapted Hamlet to the rise of Pakistani-sponsored-terrorism in the formerly peaceful South-Western parts of Jammu & Kashmir in the '90's - the most interesting being , Irrfan Khan's cameo, Roohdar,as the Ghost of Hamlet's father.Roohdar carries the message of retribution to Haider against Khurram Meer & just like the Old King's ghost asked Hamlet to spare Queen Gertrude for heavenly justice, so does Dr.Hilal Meer request the same for Ghazala Meer.Bhardwaj hasn't shied away from Prince Hamlet's/ Haider's Oedipal complex & the undercurrent between him & Ghazala - a beguiling portrayal by Tabu with echoes of ambiguity like Desdemona/Dolly (that confused Othello/Omkara)Gazala is tantalizingly ambiguous,leaving Haider confused about her guilt till the very end - ambiguous about her adultery, her true intent in Hilal's arrest & her manipulation of Haider with threats of suicide.Arshi,like Ophelia is trapped in her loyalty to both Haider & her father Polonius / Pervez Lone.Arshi demonstrates a 'charming' example of asinine subcontinental racism in her opening scene,where a North Indian moronically,refers to a South Indian as 'Masala Dosa'.Bhardwaj has inserted a little red scarf into the film, that poetically traces its path from Arshi to Pervez to Haider & back to Pervez & finally to a grieving Arshi - the scarf being unravelled by the same hands that knitted them.
 
Haider burns in the same confusion as Hamlet did. While Hamlet doubted his father's ghost as a deceptive demon: Haider fears choosing between Roohdar's & Khurram's contradictory versions of Hilal's death.Haider's dilemma is resolved when he finally overhears Khurram's confession while at prayer,displaying the remarkable self-awareness that Claudius possessed while he prayed, ""O, my offence is rank,it smells to heaven""
Kapoor trembling with a gun,behind an oblivious Kay Kay Menon is one of the several electrifying scenes in the film.Other adaptations from Hamlet are Liyaqat being used by Khurram to kill Haider as Laertes was by Claudius , Haider holding Arshi in her grave as Hamlet did with Ophelia , Haider's wedding dance like Hamlet's play to test Claudius' guilt.In contrast to Hilal's request for revenge,Haider's paternal grandfather's ( Kulbhushan Kharbanda ) voice resonates till the end when Gazala reinforces his wisdom,that revenge starts a vicious cycle & no true freedom is to be attained through it,when he pointed out the ridiculousness of people demanding for freedom when they were already free.After collapse of the USSR in '91, the militants who warred against the Soviets for a decade were unemployed - this dangerous, unsavoury population was put to work by the likes of Zia-ul- Haq ( after humiliating defeats in 3 wars with India-'48,'65,'72 ) who transferred this blood-thirsty crowd from the Western Af-Pak borders to the Eastern Indian borders & started infiltration,brainwashing & bloodshed in the peaceful state in the '90s.Haider is a victim of this brainwashing & shows delinquent tendencies as a schoolboy when he's caught carrying a gun in his schoolbag & defies both parents when they try to send him to Aligarh to save his future from ruin.Later Haider shows no qualms in murdering a guard,bludgeoning two acquaintances ( the Salmans- Rosencrantz & Guildenstern ) to death & killing Arshi's father.Ghazala risks her life to save schoolboy Haider's future & education,while Haider suspects her tactics as manipulation. She obligingly puts an end to her ambiguity when she ultimately sacrifices her life for Haider ( like Gertrude drinks the poison, Claudius arranged for Hamlet )In the blood-curdling finale, Khurram demonstrates that ,though guilty of fratricide - his love for Ghazala was true. While everyone fled from Ghazala, Khurram shockingly & bravely runs towards her .Finally when Haider could've had his revenge & has conflicting voices of his father in his mind clashing with his grand-father's & mother's, he walks away. His grand father & Gazala's voice prevailed."

" very good, only some song and dance scenes cut in too fast
",0.2716,-0.361,2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"Each era has its Hamlet; every region has its Claudius, just with different names. Undoubtedly, the story of Haider is a manifestation of the revenge of Hamlet in the region of Kashmir, a place beautiful, remote, and cruel. The scenario uses Hamlet's revenge as its skeleton, and conflicts between India &Pakistan as its flesh. This setting gives universal emotional resonance, and characteristics plus topicality. The first half tells about a young man called Haider who returned home because of his father's disappearance. He had a smart and pretty girlfriend who is the daughter of local police officer; a mother who stayed at his uncle's house after her own was destroyed; an ambitious uncle who wanted to be elected official. Haider looked still very sentimental and innocence, no matter how many times he was turned down, he was still not willing to give up hopes to find his father. Before the ""ghost"" of his father haunting, he is just a normal boy or a sensitive young poet (I watched the movie with subtitles which he describe himself as a poet, maybe the words has other mean in origin language). Well the second part, after Haider knowing his father was brutally tortured and died miserably , the movies turned into another style, which is darker, cynical, and full of violence. Even Haider himself was on the edge of madness, which accelerate the tragic story line. The open-ending is shocking but still makes sense. Similar as almost all other Bollywood movie, ""Haider"" has several song and dance scene. I want to say not every one of them was fitting the movie. One last second Haider was full of anger with his uncle, the next second he saw his girlfriend and started to sing and dance with her, this kind of turning is stiff. I like Indian style musical movies, in Haider, the dance, or rather to say a play in the play which mocked his uncle is very powerful and absorbing. The movie actually not only tells us a story of revenge, but also arouse audience to think deeply: to live in a world full of lies and under an oppressive government, how can we know what freedom is? To bear both side advocate their legitimacy then never ending conflict, how to bring peace back? Without a military maintaining order, a region will get into chaos, with an unjust military, a region will be treated terribly, and then how should we be organized and armed?All great thoughts are raised by ideologist and dreamer, but used by realist and plunger, how to prevent the common dream be taken advantage and how to keep ourselves fighting for our own freedom rather than for politician's money and career? Similar tragedies are happening every day in Kashmir, Afghanistan, LibyaÂ… Seems like they are endless, like a ouroboros. In the movie ""the great dictator"" , Charlie Chaplin appealed to all the world to stop being manipulated, to love each other, to fight for democracy , but how ?"
