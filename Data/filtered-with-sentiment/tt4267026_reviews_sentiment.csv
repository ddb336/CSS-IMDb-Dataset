" Why did I give this a chance?
",0.3071,0.8717,2021-04-08 00:00:00,3,"Even though the found-footage genre has been beaten to death again & again, I read some good reviews of this film, so I thought I'd give it a chance. What a disappointment. The premise is simple enough, all the characters have the personality of a bath mat, and are just about as likeable. Not too many movies do I root for the deaths of the main characters, but after making countless stupid decisions, it's pretty easy to start hoping they get what's coming to them. I'd estimate approximately 1/2 of the movie has a spooky ""vibe"" while there are about 3-4 somewhat scary scenes. Also, whoever holds these cameras needs serious help, as I think a 5-year old on roller skates could hold a cell phone camera more steady.Only reason I'm giving it a 3/10 is because I've seen far worse found-footage films. If you can suspend all semblance of logic & common sense, and happen to love this genre, you'll probably like it. For everyone else, it should be a hard pass."
" Equal parts good and bad. Can't quite recommend this one.
",-0.4454,0.975,2021-04-01 00:00:00,5,"I love found footage movies that are done well. This one is so close, but ultimately there isn't enough meat on the bones of this thing to satisfy.Let's start with the good:
The premise of turning an old abandoned building that might actually be haunted into a haunted house attraction is a great one and they set it up really well. Things moving around the house without explanation was really creepy and kept me on the edge of my seat. One of the things I love about found footage movies are the things going in the background that get caught by the camera that the person filming doesn't always notice. There was a good amount of that in this movie but I think it could have used a lot more.Now the not so good:
During the interviews and self-filming scenes, the actors were doing too much ""acting."" Long dramatic pauses that didn't feel like natural speech. There was a little too much static and shaky cam making it almost impossible to tell what was going on. I got the idea, but I was also really annoyed by it. It wasn't needed, especially since the effects looked pretty good and some of the best and most creepy things they did were filmed without any of that. And lastly, too much of the movie is left open and unexplained. Way too much. A guy tries to leave the production and then changes his mind because of something one of the other crew members tells him while the camera is conveniently turned off? And they spend several scenes on this. That's just one glaring example, but the event the whole movie centers around - the haunted house's opening - is ridiculously muddy. That's just lazy writing.Here's the thing: I didn't hate it. But it just wasn't that good. I might watch it again, and for me that's the true test of a decent found footage movie. If they would have focused more on the creepy parts that they nailed so well (you'll know them when you see them), they would have had a hit, in my opinion. But it took a weird turn and they threw a bunch of static over it for some reason. Damn shame."
" Bringing horror hardcore in a new way
",-0.5719,0.7574,2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"With H H Holmes as inspiration, and with enough savvy and smarts to carry an entire series, this is one of the best of the lesser seen movies to come out in the entire horror genre, after Saw. The simplicity of the conceptual plot is brought to life by above average acting and amazing found footage film techniques that develop the action at a pace in which we are forced to savor some of the scariest moments in horror history. The themes are deep enough to warrant paranoias, and the grittiness of the graphics and acting add to the element of creepiness. Great series to catch with an extra bag of popcorn!"
" Found Footage Horror Done Right
",-0.5719,-0.8958,2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,"While I like found footage horror, there has been so many of them that it's easy to suffer from wobbly camera overload. Hell House LLC is found footage horror done right. A great movie that has genuine scares that doesn't need blood and guts to be scary. With real atmosphere and decent acting, this is a movie that delivers effective scares and chilling scenes. I highly recommend this to people who like solid story telling and a really scary movie."
" Very solid and scary movie
",-0.3758,-0.0328,2021-03-18 00:00:00,8,"It's always interesting reading found footage movie reviews, they're always full of people acting all sorts of snobbish about found footage movies. I generally have to wonder why these people watch found footage movies in the first place.Anyways, I've been putting off watching Hell House LLC for the longest time because the version I had was SD and everything about it looked a bit meh to me. I finally watched it last night and it was great. It didn't rely on bad jump scares, it didn't feel the need to music, and it didn't have any sort of the usual lull these movies can get. There were some *veeeery* creepy parts and the setup for why this is a found footage movie-- a group of people making a haunted house wanted to document their process for behind the scenes footage-- works well.My only complaint is probably the documentary part felt a little flimsy and forced. I get why it's there to setup the ending, but it just made things a little awkward. The movie starts as a documentary, then they suddenly find some tapes where it's mostly just those tapes completely forgetting about the documentary part, and then throwing you right back into the documentary part to setup the endings (and yes, I would say this movie has endings). It's just a bit odd because it's basically two movies slammed together. The tapes work really well, the documentary works less well.But yeah, super creepy movie that keeps your attention the entire time that is genuinely tense and scary."
" Give this one a chance
",0.25,0.9648,2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"The stereotype that surrounds found footage these days can be found in the likes of mainstream horror like Paranormal Activity, which is fine if you like light hearted paranormal themed horror or if you are the soft hearted type who knows they scare easily and turn to such films - but for those who are more invested in finding a series that really works and don't scare easily because they are a used to the way horror is getting a little tarnished these days, I suggest this underrated gem. The realism of the film was conveyed quite well, I really enjoyed the actor's performances. The jumps are definitely a lot of fun, especially since I find myself a little numb to jump scares these days - but I really enjoyed the genuine unique storyline. I felt the director worked hard to make sure this movie worked with the crew and would deliver to the style of audience. Definitely give this a chance. I'm yet to watch the other ones, but I'm excited to give them a shot too."
" Not bad for what it is
",0.431,0.9789,2021-02-22 00:00:00,5,"I'm not usually a fan of found footage movies (or mockumentaries for that matter) but this one was really well done.The acting was a little stiff in some places, but for the most part it was pretty good. The story moved along really well, and the climax/third act was great. An interesting use of score was great as well, which is rare in a film of this sub-genre.Overall, this film gave a really tense and creepy vibe, as well as not feeling like it dragged on. I'll be checking out the sequel in the coming weeks. This is definitely a hidden gem in the found footage sub genre, which usually (in my opinion) is over saturated and disappointing. I recommend this one to horror fans of all types!"
" Had potential to spook but maybe over done
",0.0,-0.3134,2021-02-09 00:00:00,5,The potential here is very good. I found it a fresh take on a found footage genre. However my main issue was it wasn't as subtle as it should have been. I think it could of learnt alot form the Blair whitch. It has the atmosphere and the right idea. The use of some effects is quite poor. Shame this didn't quite get it right.
" Legitimately scary

",-0.4939,-0.8329,2021-01-23 00:00:00,2,"And I guess I'll offend people who like them, but it's the fault of grossly overrated, scareless movies like Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity. There is only one moment that even approaches genuine creepiness, and it's when a character is locked in with the mannequins when they're testing the strobes. But that's literally it. You don't need blood and gore in order to create fear, no, but you DO need actual scares, and this film has none. It, too, is overrated in much the same vein as the previously mentioned films.3 stars for what seemed like basically ad-libbed performances and the fact that the characters weren't total jerks."

Hell House LLC is a typical found footage horror with a lot of over the top camera shaking and annoyingly weak characters.It follows the usual head job in these types of movies where the boss dude never is exposed to the bad juju going on through out the movie only the weak are. Which wears thin pretty quickly. There is very little to no musical score through out which really cuts down on its production value. It's primarily jump scares and a few sound effects.The characters really needed a little more omph, you just can not get behind the weak people in these types of movies. Like watching some dope hide under his bed sheets when someone is in his bedroom just made me literally lol in a most sarcastic way. There were too many moments like this in the movie. Anyhow, I'll add it to the list of mediocre modern horrors."

" The best found footage horror movie
",0.128,-0.5988,2020-11-04 00:00:00,9,Bruh I'm not kidding. This is the best horror movie I've ever saw. No stupid jumpscare the suspense building is done right. The plot twist at the end is good too. The only thing to bother me is the usage of the glitch effect.
" Worth It

I was surprised that the actors did such a great job and it is genuinely spooky at times.I cannot say the same for 2/3 but I enjoyed them all for a mindless horror trilogy. This one is by far the best of the 3."
" This movie can have a score of 6 only if the scale goes up to 100
",0.0,-0.9786,2020-10-31 00:00:00,2,"The lost footage genre is one of my favorites so I've seen dozens of titles in that style. And among them all this is easily in my...bottom 10. I have no idea why it's score is so high but it absolutely does not represent the quality of the movie. Objectively speaking.First off, the idea of having a spook appear where they shouldn't be is a good technique. Except it works well when something movies in an abandoned asylum where it's obviously out of place. When it's in an escape style room full of dummies and puppets it blends so perfectly in the background that it virtually is invisible. And the filmmakers are painfully aware of this since when the camera wobbled past a spook that was not supposed to be there they literally stopped the movie, hit rewind, then replayed the shot in slow-mo pausing on the frame with the spook. The only thing missing was a red arrow with a sign ""This is scary. You should now be scared"". Nothing says quality horror like having to be told explicitly which parts should be frightening.There's a plethora of unanswered plot lines to boost as the movie cannot decide whether the spooks are a black-cloaked satanic cult, a bloodied clown demon or white-eyed ghost girl. The characters make the dumbest decisions possible, completely taking you out of the immersion. And just when you're asking yourself ""so why don't they just...leave?"" One of them tries to, then the shot changes to the aftermath of some apparent conversation where it was decided that they cannot leave. No explanation why, especially given what they were facing. Speaking of the characters, the casting is horrendous. All the actors look extremely similar, made even worse by the overall grainy found footage format, with similar names and are generally indistinguishable from each other.But the biggest offender was probably the shaky cam, which while a good technique to convey some authenticity, when overdone gets the audience either sea-sick, disoriented, or itching to call an ambulance for the Parkinson's afflicted camera-man.This is one of those rare gems in the found footage genre, which has no redeeming qualities about it whatsoever. Steer clear from this abomination. There's better ways to waste your time."
" An above average found footage flick
",0.0,-0.7269,2020-10-28 00:00:00,7,What would Halloween be without a found-footage scare-fest about a haunted house attraction? The setup is creepy with some genuinely good scares as things eventually go horribly wrong.
" A nice Halloween treat
",0.6705,-0.68,2020-10-27 00:00:00,6,"Another in a long line of found-footage horror, this one lands squarely in the middle of the pack. Not awesome - most of the ""tricks"" have been done before - but not awful either - adding the YouTube and news footage helps break up the typical found-footage monotony. The reveal of what happened in the basement is a little murky, visually, but if you've paid attention to the exposition you'll understand what happened, and the little twist at the end seeems forced and unnecessary. But the mood throughout is acceptably creepy, especially for a Halloween-season quick watch, and the clowns steal the show. If you don't like found-footage in general this won't change your mind, but otherwise a decent watch."
" Decent Found Footage Scares
",-0.34,-0.2784,2020-10-19 00:00:00,7,"Yes the genre is getting saturated with low-budget found footage movies, this is surprisingly decently executed. The plot is also nothing new but the arc over the 3 films is quite decent.The acting at first appears quite poor, until the creepiness really kicks in, which helps the scares surprisingly.The set is pretty cool and confusing so where corridors lead etc stays surprising despite not being a massive set.A lot of the scares are what we'd be worrying about in that situation, the turn of a head, the shadow behind you.The series are worth a binge watch if don't want to think too hard or take it too seriously."
" Creepy, but thin on plot
",0.0,-0.9927,2020-10-18 00:00:00,6,"Hell House LLC has a lot of pretty decent scares, but the actual story of the movie doesn't hold up.This is a found footage movie that tells the story of some down-on-their-luck New Yorkers scouting out a new location for their Halloween haunt business in the made-up town of Abbadon, New York. They buy the Abbadon Hotel, an abandoned building with a dark history. Even though something is clearly wrong with the location, the crew soldiers on towards opening night, where a terrible event claims many lives.If that sounds like a spoiler, it's not, really. The movie opens laying all of this out, and it's more about the steps that happen along the way.The movie excels at spooky atmosphere. Rather than get in your face with ghouls or excessive amounts of CGI, Hell House plays things subtle. It might be as simple as a shadow in the hallway, or things changing places when you look away for just a second, but it succeeds in being very unsettling without going overboard.That being said, some of the production is a little sloppy, particularly in the sound design department. Being found footage, a lot of the sound in this movie has a very distinct style to it -- built-in microphones on handheld cameras. It's a little bit tinny, there's room echo, and so on. Which makes it SUPER OBVIOUS when they dub in new sounds during post production, because the dubbed sounds are ten times clearer than the microphone's source audio. Not a deal breaker, but a minor annoyance.The real problem is when Hell House tries to tell its story. The actors do okay, but this movie is jam packed full of horror movie logic where everybody involved spontaneously forgets about common sense. Being found footage, the camera is always rolling, but the condemning video is always either handwaved away for convenient reasons or outright ignored entirely. These are dumb characters doing stupid things, because if they were too smart and recognized the danger then we wouldn't have a movie to watch.There's also not a lot in the way of character development. Real documentaries spend time helping us get to know the people involved, but that's glossed over here. We get little snippets of things early on, like how some people are known for arguing, or how the group had a bad time at their last haunt location in Queens. It largely does not matter, and there's zero sense of who these people were before they arrived at Abbadon. I never even knew most of their names.Without getting in to spoiler territory, I also found the ending to be sort of a letdown. The movie is great with subtle scares, but the ending ends up being more confusing and underwhelming than scary. It's this weird half-step of showing you what happened, but only the least important parts.I guess I did not hate my time with Hell House. It's fine, and mainly exists as a vehicle to deliver spooky moments. Just don't think about it too much harder than that."

",-0.5766,0.5649,2020-10-18 00:00:00,8,"I absolutely loved this movie. I honestly don't know why the ratings are so low. Maybe because this isn't your average found footage flick. If you're looking for something to just scare you with some good jump scares, steer away from this one. It builds tension brilliantly and somehow manages to keep a steady pace. And it is SO CREEPY.

" A Horror Movie!
",-0.6114,-0.976,2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"I think I've watched pretty much every horror produced in most of the world over the past 30 years. It is difficult to find something that can be truly referred to as a horror that is made to scare you. A ""spine tingler"" as they used to say. This is one of the best of those.Against the fashion to transform all there is into the inept social commentary of a wide-eyed teenager, the philosophical profundity of a stoner, or the faux complexity of a child recounting a summer holiday, Hell House does what it is supposed to do - it makes your hair stand on end while looking around the room hoping that shadow isn't anything it shouldn't be. It makes you want to hide behind your hand. It makes you want to turn it off and do something nice...but it also compels you not to do so, because you simply must stick it out.Few horror movies have managed to focus on instilling pure fear in the viewer. - as opposed to said distractions, or aimless gore and torture porn. Hell House instils that fear very effectively. Of course the story has holes. The acting is sometimes weaker than the very best there's ever been. I'm not sure that the dialogue was intended to contend with Shakespeare, nor the narrative with Poe. And thank goodness for that.Hell House is able to avoid undue concern with such issues because it uses the found-footage technique - thereby not needing to be assessed in terms of perfectionism. It is also effective that the characters in the film are doing the same as the makers of the film - this is horror upon horror!Of course, if one is a soulless pedant one might spend the film wondering how this that or the other piece of footage got found, rather than wondering if that shadow is going to jump at the screen, or if the lights will go out and.... One may finish the film wondering the hows and whys of the characters, of bemoan the similarities with Blair Witch, rather than worrying about going to bed and closing my eyes in case my mind conjures up the sight of....If you want to be scared by a movie. Turn the lights off, turn Hell House on, and feel, don't think. It's a corker!"
" Effective and Enjoyable
",0.7184,0.4596,2020-07-02 00:00:00,7,"I picked this movie at random to watch and was pleasantly surprised at what I found. Hell House LLC is a bit a twist on the tradition found footage location theme, adding the backdrop of a haunted house to add extra tension. The characters are not the most dynamic, but are more than passable. While the plot and writing are fairly standard for the genre, where this movie shines is the pacing. It is a slow burn, tension building experience that left me a little nervous to look down the stairs. It also allows for the actors to show their chemistry, further pulling in the audience. The movie manages to bring out the most scares, while simultaneously doing the least. The ending does leave a bit to be desired and all of the build up does come to a somewhat anticlimactic ending. Luckily, the strengths of this movie overshadow its' flaws and make for a fun, spooky watch."
" Great found footage film
",0.6249,0.726,2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,"I was so surprised to find this movie. I was binge watching found footage films and came across this and I want to watch it again it was so good. The only reason I gave it 9/10 instead a 10/10 is because I would love to see more of the story, maybe an extended ending. I felt a lot unanswered in the end and I think it could have used a bit more explaining in a couple areas like what the owner of the haunted house attractions (Alex I think his name was) he told the others on why they had to stay in that hotel for the haunted house attraction and why they couldn't leave. It felt unanswered and frustrating. Also would have liked to see why Sara was the only one appearing after the chaotic opening night even though she clearly wasn't alive. I hope there is or will be a second one with more explaining on the demon/demons because I was left wanting so much more! But this is easily my new favorite find as far as horror films go."

This one didn't rely heavily on jump scares like most do; it was a subtle but a super creepy scare every time.There were several cliches, but these were executed more tactfully and brought more suspense than most. Less was more with this one. Would say this is one of the creepiest found footage films I've seen.It has a similar plot to The Houses October Built, but this one had a lot more action and creepiness to it. It's easy to play off the haunted house plot, but not very many do it to this extent in such a great way. What's nice about this found footage is the shaky camera wasn't too all over the place so it was still decent to watch in that aspect.The only downfall had to have been the dialogue at times. A lot of stupid random conversations between characters that didn't fit much into the film. Other than that there wasn't much else to really dislike about it."

" Unexpectedly terrifying!
",-0.6114,-0.8517,2020-04-23 00:00:00,7,"Found footage. The first 30 minutes or so of this film had me curling my lip and cringing at the cliched unorginality of the concept, borrowing heavily from Blair Witch. Some of the documentary interviews were particularly unconvincing and badly acted.But as it progressed it became increasingly scary and by 2 thirds of the way through I was so scared I couldn't watch it anymore! I had to turn it off! I was on my own watching it in the dark, and if I'd been watching with someone else, I'm sure it would have been a different story...There aren't many spooky films that give me that sense of increasingly unbearable dread to this extent, so I was pleasantly (!) surprised. I'll definitely give it another go when I have some company for support!I would recommend this - don't be put off by the poor scripting and performances of the first half."

I think that for a ""found-footage horror"" genre Hell House LLC is right up there.Just because it is not a mainstream movie genre doesn't mean it has to be bad. I think the people who did not like it were probably watching it with a bit of a pre conceived notion of the movie being 'not good'. I quite liked the movie to be honest, it was intense.Hell House LLC definitely had THE moments .. all the ones you would expect from a horror movie - scaring you, making you say wtf is going on, telling the actors to not go there or move out from there, just saying oh no under your breath, saying are you a fool and cursing movie a few times.Overall I think it was a good watch. A pleasant surprise especially in these hard times (social distancing days) and I wouldn't want to say much but to ask you to go and watch it and decide for yourself."

Luckily this one works and even as it doesn't have any effects or let's even say blood (okay at the end a bit) it is sometimes creepy and towards the end you want to know what is going on.Of course the flick has to start with a lot of 'real' news facts and interviews with cops who were at the crime scene but once that's over the movie picks up speed. Don't watch it to closely, the footag eis edited a thing that in real life can't happen naturally but if you don't mind that, then it gives you entertainment.The use of manne quinq and clows and stuff happenng in a basement, well, face it, it delivers. What is going on with the hotel, I can't tell, ypu will have some background but no explaination at all.So, it's okay even without effects, just look at Blair Witch, no effects there, It isn't a Blair Witch but it's surely worth picking up.

But, knowing that awesome movies can have terrible names, I decided to try. I wasn't let down at all. The acting wasn't the most amazing but as long as it's not so bad as to take you out of the story I'm good with it. The storyline was great. Plot wasn't the most original in the world, but it definitely delivered on the scares and downright creepy atmosphere. I add this to my list of recommended horror movies.I love found footage films. I don't care if many people are tired of them. They just don't take time to research to see there are a plethora of greats. This is one of them and I recommend to anyone looking for a good scare."

This was one of those movies where I was looking around the room, debating whether to turn the light on. Found footage movies are everywhere, but when done right, they can be downright terrifying. This was that movie. There's a subtlety to it but it's done in a way that just intensifies the fear. Excellent movie! Highly recommend!"
" Intriguing Plot Line, Scary as Hell
",-0.8316,-0.9481,2020-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Hell House LLC is a found-footage horror film written and directed by Stephen Cognetti. It follows the plot of a group of haunted attraction creators who set up their attraction in the haunted Abaddon Hotel. Obviously everything is going to go wrong.As the quote on the cover of the film's artwork states, this movie is ""Scary as Hell."" Which is quite ironic, due to the fact the entire movie is based on satanic rituals and the basis of hell. It is easily the scariest found-footage horror film out there today. It is up there with The Blair Witch Project in plot development as well.I feel that this movie is, however, extremely misunderstood. Many see this film as a plot-hole filled, shaky found-footage movie that leads to a anticlimactic conclusion. However, to fully understand this film you must watch the second and third movie in the trilogy. This will explain many of the plot-holes and allow the viewer (including myself) to gain comprehension of what is going on.Overall, I absolutely loved this film. I am a huge horror film fan, and this has to be the scariest I've ever watched. This movie is extremely underrated and misunderstood, but the only thing I can say to that is watch the entire trilogy and see for yourself why Hell House LLC is the greatest found-footage horror film to date."
" Boring Snoozefest. Don't Waste Your Time.
",0.0083,-0.9982,2020-01-31 00:00:00,2,"Attack of the low threshold horror fans, again. Seriously what's with all the positive reviews? Anyone who thinks this movie is a horror movie just hasn't seen a good one before. Must be a bunch of teens who are easily creeped out by bad effects, jumpy distorted cameras, and obvious low budget ""tricks"" that just aren't effective enough - or who think the crapfest ""It Follows"" was actually a good movie (man, what a dumpster fire of boredom!).This movie wasn't scary or even creepy. Every scene was amateurish with easy tricks to try and fool the audience. Always convenient that every time there's a kill, the camera gets distorted or goes black. Nice. Be careful not to actually spend $5 whole bucks on some makeup or anything.Good grief, modern horror needs a serious reboot! Stop making terrible movies already. Actually work on real scares with depth and solid practical effects. Thankfully this movie didn't have any CGI, but it also didn't really have any practical effects either because all of the kills happen off-screen (convenient). It felt like being in a cheap haunted house at the fair. You know, cheap fake blood and lame scare tricks. ""Oh no, the whole cast has reappeared in black hoods."" Not scary, dude, seriously.This movie tries to have some Blair Witch elements (that movie sucked too - way overrated back in the day too - gotta watch out for those crazy witches who put up the minor inconvenience of rattling your tent - oh my, so scary), but ultimately just a bunch of guys with crap cameras yelling ""oh crap, oh man, who's messing with us!?"" constantly. ""Oh no, the mannequin actually turned his head!!!!""I'll never sleep again - due to all the mannequin movements that ""happened on their own."" (whispered voice of terror)The limp-wristed 'twist' or maybe it's just a slight right-handed veering turn via GPS at the end with the hotel room was OK, I guess, but still, just not effective enough to redeem a crap movie. And I'm not against the whole found footage thing, either. A lot of movies have done quite well with it. Not this one though.I'm beginning to think a lot of these reviews are planted. There's no way anyone would actually think this is scary or even entertaining.I just think, like modern pop music, the horror genre has the formula wrong - churning out constant crap.Go back to the classics and study the pacing, the instilled dread, the masterful practical effects, disturbing and memorable kills, etc. and actually scare the audience once in a while (i.e. cause them to have to pause and digest what they just saw). There's literally nothing memorable about this (and many other horror movies lately for that matter)."

Its not full of bad CGI or contain a score to try and heighten the sensation of being frightened. I really enjoy the 1 camera POV documentary vibe they have, much better than the Blair witch anyway, but this movie is absolutely awesome to watch, and I will probably keep it on my rewatch list for a long time. It was very well written and performed by cast and crew, my only complaint is that they never should have made Hell House 2 or 3 because they just sucked to be honest, it really took away ALL the creepiness and mystery out of the this movie. But I highly recommend this one, if you are a horror movie fan like me, I suggest this one for you!"

Being found footage, you know the characters are either all dead, or they've disappeared without a trace - otherwise there would be no purpose in it being found footage. Right?This time around we have a bunch of people setting up a Hell House - a make-believe haunted house - or so they thought, off course. I didn't find the film all that interesting. It has a bad script with way too much (unnecessary) swearing. The acting wasn't natural enough for me to believe this was actual events, especially Sara (Ryan Jennifer). 15 People died in the house, yet the reporter is excited to be in the house and even laughs at the props!!! That's just not natural!Most of the times the camera is way too shaky or unnecessarily out of focus. I mean, these guys are real amateurs at shooting their own documentary! The finale was also just too unclear. 'Hell House LLC' is just a big fat ""no"" for me."

There were more than a few jump scares that worked quite well, and I consider myself a seasoned scary movie viewer. The acting is unusually well-done for this type of picture, and this fact helps carry the movie onward to a satisfying conclusion."
" I Liked It
",0.4215,0.9913,2019-10-31 00:00:00,7,"First things first. Many reviewers are claiming that the high reviews must have come from friends and family of the cast and crew. I can't speak for others, but I am not affiliated with any of these people, and this is a completely objective review.I am a horror movie buff, and like many people, I especially enjoy a good scare around Halloween. I randomly came across this one on Prime Video and due to many good reviews. I decided to give it a try and am glad I did, as I liked it quite a bit.I am not a huge fan of FF movies, but this one was done a bit differently - it was a ""documentary"" style film with FF mixed in. This made it much more watchable for me, as the constant graininess and shaky camera effects of FF generally irritates me. While there were some FF scenes in this one that got on my nerves a bit, it was mostly well done.The acting was nothing spectacular, but above average for this genre. I didn't recognize a single actor, but that actually added to the film versus detracted from it. It gave it more of an authentic feel that these are ""real"" people. They did a fine job with their roles, in my opinion.I tend to enjoy slow burn horror films that don't rely heavily on cheesy jump scares and pointless gore. This one delivered in that regard, and there were some genuinely creepy, ""hair stands on end"" moments. The setting of the old abandoned hotel was perfect. It was a claustrophobic, dark, creepy environment. Put it this way - I wouldn't stay at this hotel!Bottom line: if you like horror movies and don't mind FF, this is worth a watch. It was a pleasant surprise for me.SIDE NOTE: I am glad I didn't actually READ any of the reviews on this site prior to watching the film, as the UNIDENTIFIED SPOILERS would have completely ruined it for me. C'mon, people. If your review has spoilers in it, please label it as such. I have skipped on watching many films that I unintentionally read spoilers on ahead of time. And it always frustrates me to no end. Thanks in advance for your attention to your future reviews."

This movie isn't perfect, but there were at least four or five occasions where my hair actually stood on end, and that's pretty rare. The actors are convincing and at times beautifully portray real terror, to the point you wonder if the director messed with them a bit (a la Blair Witch).If you like being scared without the gore, I'd definitely give this one a go."

I really liked it. They definitely did a great job nailing the building tension and terror. The acting was generally good. And the plot was plausible as were the character motivations.
The problems, usually, with found footage films is the seemingly irrational reason for someone to use their cameras even at the most horrific moments. For most of this film, there are valid reasons. Only a few moments are you thinking ""why would they have a camera on for this?"" I'm also sure that most haunted attractions do not allow customers to take video of the attraction itself while inside ... but that's a minor point.The sequels were of lower quality, but they did answer some of the questions ... that maybe didn't need answering. Still, I enjoyed the first one enough to watch the two sequels, so that says something.I definitely recommend!"

It's gone out of fashion now unfortunately with only a couple of series, 'Hell House LLC' being one of them, keeping it alive. It was such a great concept because it took the audience away from their comfort zone. It's easy in a regular horror movie, with a decent sized budget and easily recognisable actors to remember that ""this is just a movie"". It's a lot harder to remind yourself of that when what you're being shown is as raw as this.'Hell House LLC' is a documentary style ""found footage"" film, so not everything we see is footage that has been found - although that is the large majority of the film. The first 20 or so minutes of the film before we get to the footage are definitely the weakest point of the film. There are some poorly written (and acted) interview scenes and it doesn't do a whole lot to set the mood for what is to come. From there though it finds its way and builds and builds until it reaches the big climax. The final 20 minutes of this film are incredibly strong and are exceptionally well put together. They play a large part in making this film as good as it is.The film can be a little hard to follow in parts. You can lose your bearings on what exactly is going on - some could argue this is realistic towards actual found footage - but I don't think it was intended that way. Also some of the acting isn't always the sharpest consistently throughout the film. Otherwise though this is a really neat little horror film. There are a couple of sequels out now which I will have to track down and give a watch. I would recommend this one."

I expected much more considering the high rating for a found footage movie. I even felt the need to write my first review to counter the movie's rating.The pace is incredibly slow yet there is still almost no time dedicated to the back story. A good found footage will at least explain the lore behind whatever legend or creepy thing is wreaking havoc. There's maybe one minute total of a complete vague, unoriginal story about a classic satanic cult. Never mind how a satanic cult has anything to do with causing the few creepy things that happen in movie.There's probably 3-4 ""scary"" moments in the total movie, but they are all very predictable. They are just your typical jump scare tactics that you can see coming a mile away.The acting isn't bad and is pretty much on par for a FF film. However, once you finally get to see the visitor found footage at the end, you will find yourself sorely disappointed. 10 minutes of blurry non scary running around doesn't really do anything for me. Also, the visitors ""escaping"" are walking at the pace of a grandma crossing the street. It's laughable.There is a mild twist at the end. The twist adds nothing to the plot though and is completely rushes through. This movie is just a poor rip off of the Blair Witch that adds nothing to the genre.

" Creepy, but it could have been better
",0.5927,-0.9976,2019-10-14 00:00:00,5,"Found footage horror movie set in an abandoned hotel that some enterprising young people hope to turn into an elaborate Halloween haunted house. But on opening night, things go horribly wrong and 15 people end up dead. An investigative journalist sets out to uncover the truth of Hell House.When Hell House LLC works, it's incredibly effective. There are parts of the film that really creeped me out. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's clowns. So, when dead-looking clown mannequins start moving mysteriously in the night, it's uber-creepy to me.. Throw in a basement with Satanic drawings on the wall and old bibles scattered on the floor and I'm ready to hide until it's all over. The backstory of the hotel and the hotel itself are also pluses for the film. You get a weird, spooky vibe from the building even before anyone sets foot inside it. Finally, I like the fact that Hell House LLC is really two found footage movies in one. I won't spoil anything, but the twist at the end worked on me.But as my rating would indicate, all is not perfect with Hell House LLC. I have two chief complaints. First, almost every character involved in the haunted house preparation is as annoying as sin. The entire time I was watching, I just hoped Paul and Danny would be among the dead. Second, and more importantly, not a single character in the movie displayed an ounce of common sense. You hear strange things in the night - what do you do? Walk around with a camera and a weak flashlight? Well that's what these people do. Turn on the damn lights! The lights work - use them. And after you've seen strange things that shouldn't happen (like a dead-looking clown moving around), do you get out? Not if you're these lunkheads. The first time I saw some of the happenings they see, I'd be on the first bus out of town. But because the characters in this movie act without an iota of common sense, they're like lambs led to slaughter.Overall, a real mixed bag. Hell House LLC is creepy enough, but the characters really hurt my enjoyment.5/10"

The setting of a haunted house attraction works well and by the time the film is done you feel like you've spent the entire time in one. Would be great to watch right before you actually went to a haunted house attraction. My only complaint was the contrivance that the chained girl in the basement wouldn't have had access to the key. Sure that means she cant escape but it stretched the bounds of viewer believability & everyone watching the movie with me commented on it. It also wasnt clear why they couldn't have just left, an enigmatic scene about something Alex had done that meant they had to stay despite all the creepiness but no clarity as to what that was. For those reasons it's not a total homerun but still well structured (with an good framing story surrounding the found footage) & quite spooky"

They're (mostly) quite likable people, and I was rooting for them, but you know how things go in these types of films. There's actually some character development here, and I'd consider none of them a particular trope.The haunted house atmosphere - which could have been incredibly cheesy in less capable hands - works really well, and the use of the many plastic models that populate the house are effective (particularly a nasty bit when a character is stuck in a room with a strobe light.)Sound and the corner-of-your-eye visuals are a plus. Look closely for some of the more subtle scares. I did have some issues with what I assume was meant to be a twist ending, but not enough to spoil what came before it.I would put this among my list of favorite horror movies of all time. It beats The Conspiracy as the best found footage movie I've ever seen.This would make a really great companion piece to The Houses October Built. A fun double feature for sure."
" Enjoyable, sometimes genuinely scary horror
",-0.6124,-0.9406,2019-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Ive watched quite a lot of horror films, and this is one of the ones that got me quite good 😂 I found myself with my covers near my face, and feeling actually scared at some points. It doesn't just fill the void with jump scares either, it relies on slower paced scares. The payoff isn't really there though with the film having these tense and horrifying moments, only to end up leading up to a confusing, and slightly dissapointing ending. It's everything you want from a found footage horror film, and a lot better than i was expecting."

" LLC: Looks Like Crap.
",-0.0258,-0.9925,2019-09-29 00:00:00,4,"Hell House LLC is a faux horror documentary (yes, another one) which feels like a mix of Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project, set in a Halloween haunted house attraction (the third Halloween haunt themed horror I have seen this month, the others being 2018's Hell Fest and this year's Haunt). As such, it feels incredibly stale, churning out all the clichés of the 'found footage' genre as though there hasn't been a gazillion similar films since the turn of the millennium.The film sees a documentary crew investigating the Hell House tragedy in Abaddon, NY, where multiple injuries and fatalities occurred on the opening night of the Halloween attraction set up by Alex Taylor (Danny Bellin) and his crew. Interviewing survivor Sara (Ryan Jennifer Jones), the documentarians are given recordings filmed during the weeks leading up to the tragedy, tapes that reveal inexplicable creepy happenings that would have most rational people getting the hell out of Dodge ASAP (the name of the town would have been enough for me to stay well clear in the first place!).Shaky camerawork, glitchy video recording, people behaving irrationally, inanimate stuff moving by itself, a final act in which all hell breaks loose: it's all there, and if you are one of the few who haven't grown completely bored of the format by now, the film should satisfy your yearning for more of the same. For me, the whole 'found footage' thing lost its appeal somewhere around the third Paranormal Activity film, and this film didn't reignite my interest.BTW, LLC actually stands for Limited Liability Company."

" It wasn't awesome, but . . .
",-0.284,-0.6058,2019-09-21 00:00:00,6,"I've definitely seen a lot worse. I don't have a television or any of the services (like cable or satellite television), so I stream movies on my computer. I think I've seen every horror movie on Pluto.tv about five times, so decided to check this one out on Amazon. I knew it was going to be a low budget found footage movie and so I didn't expect a lot from it.Given the low expectations that I had, the movie was surprisingly good. It had some genuinely creepy instances and a couple that I found genuinely scary. I don't do strobe lights, so I had to turn away for those sequences and I know I missed some vital things, but overall, I found the cinematography to be adequate for what the movie promised. I wasn't happy with the end of the big dramatic scene before the movie epilogue. I get that it's supposed to be found footage and there were a lot of people running and pushing, but a few more seconds of focus on the action that was CAUSING the running and pushing (and screaming and panic) would have been appreciated.One thing I didn't care for was the constant reliance on the F-word. Come on, people. You're making a film. Presumably your grasp of the English language and your imaginations are better than that. I found that the language made the characters seem less intelligent and less empathetic.Overall, it was not a brilliant piece of film-making, but it was an okay way to pass a hot Gulf South afternoon. I wouldn't recommend it highly, but I could recommend it to people who are realistic about found footage film expectations, and would do so with a clear conscience."
" One of my favorite Halloween films
",0.4588,0.945,2019-09-20 00:00:00,9,I found this one night on Amazon Prime and was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this. I will admit that I really enjoying it. I now watch it every year around this time to help me get into the Halloween feel.
" Freaky Found Footage Film
",-0.3612,0.9947,2019-09-11 00:00:00,9,"This was a film that when I first got into podcasts, I was hearing a lot about it. I added it to my list of films to see, but hadn't gotten around to it until now. I did know coming in that it was found footage, but that was about it. To get into this, the synopsis is five years after an unexplained malfunction caused the death of 15 tour-goers and staff on the opening night of a Halloween haunted house tour, a documentary crew travels back to the scene of the tragedy to find out what really happened.We start this with documentary film crew as they're trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Hell House LLC. Leading them is Diane Graves (Alice Bahlke). To start it off, we are given a YouTube video of someone in line for the Halloween haunted house. We follow them as they go through, but they never finish. They get to the basement and then all hell breaks lose. We get some background information and then Sara Havel (Ryan Jennifer Jones) shows up with tapes from that night. She's asked why she didn't turn them over to the police, but she doesn't have an answer.Her boyfriend is Alex Taylor (Danny Bellini). He's the owner of Hell House LLC and every year they put on events like this. They're going to Abaddon, New York as there is an old hotel they can take over. There actually seems to be a history here, but Alex claims he has no idea about that. With Alex and Sara are Andrew 'Mac' McNamera (Adam Schneider), Paul O'Keefe (Gore Abrams) and Tony Prescott (Jared Hacker). We see early on there are some issues in this group.As they get the place ready, some weird things start to happen. Paul is tasked with filming their progress and he starts to see a figure that is wearing the clown mask from the basement. When the actors show up, Melissa (Lauren A. Kennedy) lets on this hotel actually has a past. Paul isn't the only one affected by this as it all culminates in a nightmare on their opening night. It's there that we see from multiple angles what really happened.Now I wanted to go a little vague here with this recap as this movie doesn't have the deepest story, but there are really some things to experience here. I will admit though, I really liked this one. It also does certain things that make me feel uneasy so I have to give credit there for sure.The elephant to address first is that this is found footage. This one works for me as there's a reason for a camera to be filming all the time. Alex uses it for promotional stuff as well as for the next year to not duplicate things and to keep it fresh. There are moments where it gets a bit shaky, which I'm not always a fan of. They do a great job at having these in the background, so it does make me feel uneasy though looking all over the frame. I give a lot of credit if you can do that.This shouldn't come as a spoiler, but this is a haunted house film. I like the way that it is presented though, you're not completely sure if it's really haunted or is someone really just messing with them. There's some great back-story here though that's actually subtle. The name of the town is Abaddon, which is the demon that is supposed to guard the gates of hell. It's fitting that Hell House LLC would come here then. On top of that, there's the story that a cult was operating in this hotel, which also works for me.From here I want to shift to the pacing. To be honest, I thought they did an interesting job here. It starts off hooking us with the original information that got released. They then go about giving us some experts before actually showing us the footage that Sara brings them. We then get to see everything from the beginning. I like that Alex has his company on the line here, so he is steadfast nothing is happening. From there though, things that are happening are subtle. Using a haunted house is a brilliant setting, because it is easy to think that they're messing with each other and things to go unnoticed. I also liked the ending as well.Something that I can be a bit of an apologist about is acting in movies like this. I don't care if they're not the best, because it does give more an amateur feel to the found footage angle. Abrams I thought was good. He carries the camera for most of the film and I thought he was pretty funny at times. I like Bahlke's portrayal in that she is inquisitive and wants to get to the bottom of this. She is a bit over the top though, which makes sense in the end. Jones has an interesting performance and as well as Schneider. The rest of the cast works for what is needed with a shout-out to Kennedy for what she's wearing in the basement of the haunt.To the effects, I'm glad they didn't go CGI here. Being this is found footage; I think it's smart they went with a more natural practical effect angle. The thing is there's not really a lot in the way of effects either. They just have people standing quite still and it can definitely be quite creepy if I'm honest. There's also a scene in Paul's room that terrified me. The found footage aspect of the film works with bringing realism to all of this.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I like that there's really only music in the documentary parts of the film. That makes sense as when you see them on TV; they will have dramatic music with it. There's just ambient noise which makes it creepy. The use of sound from other rooms really works here as well, especially the piano.Now with that said this film I actually really liked. It actually made me feel quite uneasy if I'm going to be perfectly honest. I like the use of a haunted house set up for Halloween as the setting, because of how it staves off if there's really a haunting or not. I like the subtle back-story here and how things play out with that. It is paced in a way where I never got bored and just wanted to know what would happen next. The acting was believable for a found footage film. They didn't do a lot in the way of effects, but I think that works in making it seem more real. That also works with the soundtrack of the film by using mostly ambient noise. I'm probably coming in higher than most here, but I really liked this and thought it was good. I would highly recommend this if you are into found footage films for sure. That is something I know is an issue for some people, but I would say to give this chance."

-You want something fun, short, and scary enough to watch (at least at times) through your hands
-You want to get in the Halloween mood, but don't want to commit to something as deep as Ari Aster or Jordan Peele
-You're not overly sick of found-footage films
-You liked Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project (maybe even found them pretty scary) and won't mind at least two scenes ""inspired by"" Blair Witch
-You won't get super triggered by people not getting out when they oh, so clearly should
-You don't need every film you see to be 10/10, or so deep that you're still discussing it for days afterward
-You don't need to have *every single thing* that happens in a film explained to you in great detail
-You're ready to be pleasantly surprised by this movie NOT being bad at all!As pretty big horror buffs, we didn't regret watching this on a dark, rainy day, after it came randomly across our feed. I will say that I do agree with the lower-star reviewers who were angry about people ""not getting out"" -- they're not wrong!! We even laughed about the main characters' choices. The difference is, it didn't deter me from liking the film or watching through my hands for lots of it. The scares were solid, the story was compelling, and I thought the filmmakers did a good job overall.I don't regret spending a couple hours on it, and will probably sleep with the lights on tonight! :)"

" A solid found-footage style movie, with a good concept and genuine scares!
",0.3382,-0.9245,2019-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Me and my partner were browsing Amazon Prime, hoping to find a horror film that would genuinely give us a creepy atmosphere, and not just be a low budget cheap knock off. Fortunately we found Hell House LLC. This film was brilliant, and it comes down to the following reasons;The concept/background:
So it is a simple premise. A group of friends like to create haunt's for Halloween every year, and have found ""Hell House"", an abandoned property which they feel is ideal for their next attraction. As you can imagine, the house has a dark history with some rather unsettled spirits present.The atmosphere/scares:
The atmosphere was thick with tension and also gave you a sense of claustrophobia at times. From the first 5 minutes with this documentary style introduction, you are left with a cold shiver down your spine. The film then proceeds to have a rather slow build up but the tension keeps increasing. The scares mainly consist of props, but these are genuinely creative and frightening moments. (If you are scared of clowns/dolls - you will hate moments of this movie).Why have I knocked off 2 stars? I personally felt that the ending was a bit unnecessary. I would have preferred a bit more of a ambiguous ending which left certain plot points open."

Are the characters characters, or bad actors playing themselves? Does it show you enough of the evil that you're satisfied, but not so much that there's nothing left to wonder about? Do they keep the fear of the unknown, or do they submit to horror fans' lust for gore?On these questions and others, Hell House LLC could have gone horribly wrong like so many low-budget horror movies, and halfway through, I thought maybe it would. Instead, the third act was seriously scary and showed some imagination, powerfully redeeming itself where many similar movies descend into nonsense.As someone who watches way too much horror, it was fun and surprising to see a relatively recent, cheaply made, found-footage horror movie succeed on as many levels as this one does.

I loved the music, especially the piano which is actually a part of the horror. The clowns was scary as hell. How they used the clowns for the build up was great. The first time I saw this film, it terrified me. I don't get terrified easily. The use of the camera and the tours through the house were earie as hell. The faces that kept showing up gave me goosebumps. The little things they showed, like the figures walking the halls at night and the clown guy moving all over the placed were brilliant. There were a few unexplained things though. The scene where their was an argument and a player stormed outside ready to quit. Something was told to him to get him to not leave. What was that? The guys who were the demons were vague and blurry. Could have been better if we knew where they came from and why they were there. All in all, a great scary movie."

Yes there are stupid character decisions and things that just don't add up, but if the movie made sense and logic took over well, there would be no movie. It serves as good old entertainment and actually has a couple pretty good scares. In my opinion in order to really enjoy a horror movie is to completely immerse yourself in it, no phones or distractions. Call me old fashioned but it's a much better experience if you pay attention.

" Awesome Film
",0.6249,-0.9971,2019-03-04 00:00:00,7,"Hell House LLC is a tense, fun and scary little low budget found footage horror film and definitely one you want to sit back and pay attention to.My first viewing, I admittedly, background watched it and dismissed it as average, but after a second viewing, it's clear...Hell House LLC is a horror film at the top of its game, and makes for a far more engaging ride than anything bearing the Paranormal Activity moniker. Its a clever film that does justice to the tired and dried out found footage sub-genre.The premise revolves around an ""incident"" at a Haunted House that left several people dead and many other traumatized. The film is a combination of post-event documentary and found footage that combined, tell the story behind the tragedy from past and present timelines.The cast is terrific, all unknowns who bring along a strong and realistic chemistry that adds to the authenticity. An authenticity that's essentially required to settle into a film that needs you to buy into a ""this really happened"" found footage premise. So points thereBut now, is it scary?Yes! I thought so. And no hollow jump scares eirher, all of the scares in Hell House LLC are well earned. Through a combination of clever ideas, nailbiting suspense, and disturbing images, this film plays out like you yourself are going through haunted house, amping up the scares and tension with each step forward until you're engulfed in pure chaos and horror. It's a wild ride and I cannot recommend it enough!Worth mentioning: If you're not a fan of found footage horror films, Hell House LLC will most likely NOT be making a convert of you.It's a formulaic film and has all the familiar tropes and cliches you'd expect from a found footage horror flick... Its just one that manages to get right what so many others have failed at before. Thrill you, scare you and keep you entertained for 90 minutes."
" Wow, was this underwhelming.
",0.5859,0.7484,2019-02-24 00:00:00,2,"So, I don't really understand the positive reviews for this flick. I'm going to go with some other reviewers and say that the positive ones are either friends of the people that made this mess or otherwise are associated with the film in some manner. It's basically standard found footage flair, and I don't think it has a lot going for it. This genre has been done to death.The documentary style has been seen before, although it is a unique way to open the story. To also have a news report thrown in was cool, as well. Then the movie goes back, upon revealing that there are tapes leading up to the opening night of the haunted hotel attraction.So five friends decide its a good idea to open a haunted house... in a hotel that may be actually haunted? At least one person, the owner, has died in the hotel in the late 1980s.But I'm going to be honest. The buildup to the opening night was super slow. The movie just draaaags along for long periods where literally nothing happens. The whole ""haunted house"" theme wasn't scary. The props were dumb, and again, not scary. Just because someone decided to have 13 dummies dressed like clowns or whatever, hanging from the ceiling, or behind the bar, doesn't create terror. They don't even move. They just sort of stand there. Throw in a strobe light, fake spiders and cobwebs and... just a big Yawn from me. I will watch it to the end just to say I did. I might give the second Hell House a try. Just maybe.Hopefully it's better than this poor excuse for a movie."

",-0.4767,-0.668,2019-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Nothing good to say about this film. It had terrible acting and a done to death plot about a cult. Like all cheap handy cam videos they get ""shaky"" and ""distorted"" so you never see anything because they can't afford special effects or real production. This idea was neat in the late mid to late 90's with Blair Witch but in 2015-16 when this came out? Are you kidding me? This should of been straight to youtube. I almost feel like a victim for having watched this mess of a movie. They didn't even try to deliver a story."

I actually screamed out loud at one scene and had to close all the curtains in my house because I was so creeped out. But there were some things that irritated me. Without giving spoilers, the scene in the basement near the end that should have shown us something, but the camera was too shaky to see what we all wanted to see. Ugh!! And the conversation that took place outside about staying, but the reason wasn't told to the audience. But overall, a good scary movie. Give it a shot! I bet you'll enjoy"

Honestly, who hasn't had the thought that something could go horrible wrong in a haunted house and that fiction could quickly turn to reality? That's part of what makes it all the more scary, right?I think the concept of the movie was well thought out and the actors and everything worked well for low budget film. I typically watch a movie before I go into work (I work the rave hard shift alone) and I honestly had to turn this one off and resume later because I thought it would make me too paranoid to be at work which is not something I ever really do.There weren't a lot of jump scares or anything, mostly just genuine terror and anxious anticipation. I also would have LOVED to see more gore in this (there was basically none at all) or even a few more creepy encounters as I feel like there was a lot of set up for the main event and not much delivered there. Also not a fan of the fact that it didn't really explain even remotely what the hell was going on, it just kind of gives you the notion you're dealing with something paranormal.All in all, I'd probably watch it again with someone else but not really on my own and I don't think I'd check out the second one."

Instead of cheesy CGI, Hell House LLC gets its scares from things that lurk in the shadows.The acting is passable. The mannequins are scary as hell. Especially if you hate clowns.I wish more horror movies would make use of the subtle creepiness of the dark instead of relying on unbelievable special effects.I watched this on Shudder, and this is the only movie there that had moments that scared me.

This movie has gotten lots of praise on the r/horror subreddit as of late, so naturally, I had to check it out. Although there are some slow scenes, I was thoroughly creeped out with the majority of the movie and my patience was rewarded in the end. I'd much rather watch an indie horror as opposed to the types that Hollywood churns out, but unfortunately with a good portion of low-budget flicks, a decent, watchable horror is hard to come by and Hell House LLC is one of the good finds. I didn't need to put much thought into watching this one, but that's okay, as sometimes it's satisfying enough to sit back and be entertained, and this one fit the bill. There were plenty of genuine, earned scares, and it was thankfully lacking in cheap jump scares. The unknown-to-me actors were all excellent, believable and probably some of the best I've seen in movies comparable to HHLlc. I rated this a solid 8/10, just because I was so delighted with Hell House LLC's indie budget and cast and wasn't expecting much, but was ultimately impressed."

",0.0,-0.9331,2018-09-25 00:00:00,10,"I love the horror genre. Unfortunately, I think the found footage phenomenon has run its course, most of these films are comprised of cheap jump scares, and the subgenre desperately needs to die out. Fortunately, this film is the outlier.The story brilliantly begins with the ending. Well, some of the ending. It crafts a suspenseful narrative by starting off with snippets of the tragedy this story is leading to, pulling the audience in immediately.While the scares do begin fairly early in, they build with a slow creep, allowing room for them to keep outdoing themselves while still keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat every step of the way.The most difficult tight rope any horror creator must walk is the one of showing too much versus showing too little. Writer/director Stephen Cognetti maintains this balance skillfully all the way to the very end.I can't recommend Hell House LLC enough. Especially if you're as tired of the found footage trend as I am, give this one a chance. You will not be disappointed."
" Better Than Average Found Footage Movie
",0.4404,-0.9915,2018-09-24 00:00:00,9,"I'll be honest - I don't like found footage movies. I think they're lazy, unscary, and most of all - they don't usually make sense. If you're encountering a murderer, monster, or ghost, put the camera down and run, you idiot. However, Hell House manages to make what is, perhaps, the best and scariest example of this subgenre to date.Hell House starts off a lot like an Unsolved Mysteries episode as people are trying to figure out what happened to this rag tag group of haunted house creators and their attraction that went horribly wrong. To be honest, some of the first act gave me pause. The acting in the ""documentary"" scenes felt a bit arch and like something out of a parody, but once we get to the real footage and meat of the film, I was genuinely surprised by the realism and quality of the acting.What Hell House really does well is the scares. I can't remember the last time I was so frightened by a film. They're mostly cut from a more subtle cloth. There aren't a whole lot of loud bangs and stingers to jolt your out of your seats - the images themselves do that. There's one particular scene involving a mistaken identity (perhaps a riff on The Haunting's ""if I'm not holding your hand, then whose hand am I holding?"" scene) that's downright bone chilling. Hell House might look like your average, dull found footage movie on the surface, but it's far from it and well worth your time."

That was an excellent way to watch this movie. There were parts that scared the crap out of me and I'm really not easily scared. Found footage has become so oversaturard these days in horror but this somehow had a fresh approach to it. What a great idea for a movie and for being low budget I have to say the acting was on point. I felt the entire time like I was watching real found footage. Nothing seemed staged and that is hard to do with a film like this. Watch this movie and watch it in the dark!"

" Intense update to many classic horror genres
",-0.5267,0.9269,2018-09-03 00:00:00,10,"Kurt Russel joints were always good, through their time periods, along with Schwarzenegger flicks, even Bela Lugosi was a great actor who franchised horror films in the early years of cinema. The additions of technique pioneered, of course, by The Blair Witch Project, are really updated with this intense rally against our youths and of phobias and fears of generations behind ours. Note that the dialogue stretches with the actor's ability, each in a methodical character portrayal obviously pivotal to the catchy storylines, whose convergence for the grand finale are truly caught up to us at a terrific rate, and to which the epilogue certainly owes its own eerie overlengthy-feeling tempo. Compare the ""unintentionally gripping"" story of Rosemary's Baby, pared with the classic macarbe writing of a mastermind such as The Shining, from a news interview angle that actually works on its own, to propel the gruesome fates of everyone in the movie. I hope to enjoy the rest of the trilogy!"

I was wondering if these were actual reviews or just shills for the people responsible for making the movie. After taking the time to watch this movie, I can say that without a doubt, these were definitely genuine reviewers. No need to rehash the plot as many here have already done so, I will just agree with them that the ""found footage"" genre has gotten stale and overdone lately, but this film does it correctly. It proves that when you actually take the time to develop a good script and find quality actors, not just your friends, a great movie can be produced."

That's what I was expecting to get from a film titled ""Hell House"" with no-name actors and actresses. That's not what I got.Instead, I got a well thought out film with people who can actually act, a plot-line that didn't feel contrived, and enough unsettling scenes to keep me viewing.The most predictable part came right at the end with 2C - it was obvious what would happen and I'm sure the twist could have been made better. However, that's a minor blemish.The only mystery in this film that never gets explained is what was it that forced them to stay at the house. The found-footage cuts off just as it's about to be revealed during one of the conversations. Maybe I missed the explanation later on - or perhaps it was just left in as a joke on the audience by the film makers (they actually filmed the entire conversation and then in edit decided to cut it out deliberately)."

" Surprisingly effective found footage horror
",0.1531,-0.9308,2018-06-18 00:00:00,8,"The found footage subgenre of horror has a plethora of entries that give it a bad name. They're low-budget and target easily scared viewers, and therefore usually suffer from an abundance of cliches in the horror department in order to give the audience that jump scare many viewers (like myself) roll their eyes at. A jump scare is only effective once an atmosphere has been generated. Thankfully, Hell House sets a tone early on with its documentary angle, making everything feel like its based a real event. It also avoids the trappings of many found footage movies by keeping pointless scenes to a minimum between the cast; it gets straight to the point of its plot, and paces itself through to a strong ending.
Its a simple premise, but strong credit has to be given to the writer/director who admirably traverses a well-worn genre with noticeable skill. The film is seeped in dread by the time you get to know these characters and fathom the true terror that awaits them. Its stern in its scares, providing very few actual jump scares (though one particularly worthy one) and relies on common phobias and practical effects to induce nervous tension. Clown props and darkness are simple tricks but effective, and Hell House pleasingly delivers unnerving moments on its well-acted cast of unknown actors, before transcending into chaotic scenes promised by its title.
Anyone critical of found footage horror will be pleasantly surprised with this rare success. 8/10."

I've watched many horror movies and up to this point I've been scared by a grand total of zero of them. Even classics that are known for being terrifying I don't find scary at all but this is actually terrifying in places.My confusion is where other people that have reviewed it have said it's boring and there is poor camera work however, unlike most found footage movies, it was interesting the whole time. There was casual dialogue throughout between the characters and made it realistic. The acting was also commendable particularly in scenes when tension is high.Genuinely an amazing movie and is 100% one I'll watch again and will be recommending to everyone.

Storyline is a little cliched, but I have to say it's as good a 'haunted house' film as I've seen for many a year.

So, let's take a spoiler free walkthrough of Hell House LLC.The Good: Sometimes with good movies, especially with horror, your expectations get set high from the feedback you're hearing from everyone else. For that reason, if I hear a movie is the scariest, funniest, etc. ever I try not to read any more reviews and try to set the bar as low as possible. Otherwise, chances are I'll end up disappointed. I went into this honestly expecting a knock-off of The Houses October Built but I was actually pleasantly surprised by the end. I can say that most of the reviews/suggestions that I've read to watch this movie are warranted and I can understand why it's gained traction the way that it has. Maybe I had the bar set low, but it still exceeded my expectations and that's an awesome thing.The movie takes course of the period of a couple weeks with a haunt crew getting ready for their big money season. They end up bunking in the haunt they're setting up and spooky shenanigans ensue. As far as the film itself goes, it has a few really strong points that compensates for its weaker ones. All I'll say is that Stephen Cognetti knows his shit. There is a definite sense of suspense and dread that he manages to build through the course of the film. There's an art to a scare and it's a fine line between showing the audience just enough but without revealing everything behind the curtain. A lot of modern horror goes for the money shot way too soon and ultimately suffers for it. This is not one of those movies. Another finer detail that distinguishes Hell House LLC from the rest of the pack is that it doesn't hold your hand. I love when a writer/director leaves enough clues along the way that you can piece together the little gaps in the story. Sure, it's great every now and again to have the story told straight to you but for horror, mystery can be a key component. From the very start of the movie, the ""documentarians"" and other interviewees are quite vague about what happened ""on the night of the accident"" and they also don't seem very sure about what happened either. There are even moments later in the film that you end up needing to piece together yourself too. It shows a level of trust from the director that the audience doesn't need to have the whole story to be spoon-fed to them and I can appreciate that. The Bad: The story seems somewhat generic as far as found footage films go and the always odd explanation of why someone is recording everything is kind of weak. The haunt attendees I guess make sense so from that point of view it's okay, but as far as the constant recording when they're setting things up I didn't quite get it. To be fair, I think if this had been filmed in a conventional way the delivery of the scares wouldn't have had as big of an impact. It's not that the use of found footage was bad in this case, moreso just the reasoning behind it that nagged me a bit. As far as my complaints go, this one wasn't huge.Unfortunately, as far as the actual story goes, this doesn't bring anything new to the table. That includes the group of people who all know each other and do the stereotypical young adult horror movie bs. Luckily it doesn't have that big of an impact on the movie since it jumps into things pretty quickly but it's a bit noticeable and the fact that one of the guys is a douche kind of plays into the story at some point. For what it's worth, they're also the best actors in the movie so it's probably for the best that they get the most screen time. The worst of the acting definitely comes from the interviewees in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie that speculate on the group dynamic and what happened on the night of the incident. The Judgment: Luckily the direction of the movie prevailed over all else and delivered an overall creepy and great film. The ending leaves a bit to be desired and almost comes off a little cliché but it doesn't take away from the rest of the movie. I'd recommend this one to any found footage lover or to anyone just looking for something good that's a little under the radar. This one will make you think twice about going in the basement."
" Movie of stupid decisions and plot holes
",-0.5267,0.5519,2018-04-16 00:00:00,4,"Why would anyone make any of the decisions the characters make in this movie?At the first occurrence of mannequin clowns randomly moving, turning their heads, and changing locations, any rational person would leave the facility. Why exactly were all the staff members obligated to stay? What had Alex done to force them? This is a huge plot hole that never gets filled. And how/why would a team of documentary film makers not know/discover that the only female staff member was dead or never found, then choose to enter into a building where multiple people had been killed?Why would any such building not be condemned and destroyed?Why would any such haunted house have only *two* exits, clearly violating building codes?Stupid movie, full of inconsistencies. But at least it's fun to watch."
" Jump scares ahoy!
",-0.4003,0.749,2018-03-17 00:00:00,8,"We love horror films and this was great for a jump scare! 
This isn't a film that has an amazing storyline and there's no real depth to it but it's an enjoyable watch. 
I'm not easily frightened and this film kept my anxiety up there. The jump scares are endless- I won't be visiting a haunted house any time soon."
" One of the better ""found footage"" films
",0.4404,-0.9294,2018-02-21 00:00:00,7,"I scrolled through available Prime movies and took a chance on this one without knowing anything about it. I admit, I was expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised! This is a pretty good horror movie! The acting was solid, creepy location and some genuine scares. I would never want to stand next to those clown mannequins ::shudder::I do think they gave us hints too early on as to what was going to happen. If you've watched a lot of horror films and found footage films you're probably going to notice the cliches and figure out the twists early on like I did. The girl starts acting weird. There's always THAT one person that talks everyone else into staying when clearly they they should leave.We also know that nothing REALLY bad is going to happen until the end of the movie because if it had then they wouldn't have gone on with the opening of their haunted house. As soon as it was revealed that no one had seen or heard from Sarah since the crime and ""Sarah"" handed the reporter a bag of found footage from the crime scene that no one had ever seen and the report asked ""why haven't you given this to the police""? and she responds creepily ""you'll see"" = big red flag that our ""twist"" ending will have something to do with Sarah not being who says she is or is involved in the murders somehow."
" Wow! Watching it again right after the 1st time
",0.6239,0.3999,2018-02-19 00:00:00,10,It has been years since I watched a movie that was able to creep me out. I even had to turn my light back on and I do not easily get scared. Don't miss this movie!!!
" WHY THE POSITIVE REVIEWS????
",0.6767,-0.9434,2018-01-27 00:00:00,3,"This movie was rather boring. First half was creepy. Second half was worse than cliche. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BASEMENT? You'll never know. They don't give any explanation. WEAK ass satan-worship kinda film. Hooded figures just show up and... what... kill people? *THAT'S IT?!?!** I was so bored that I perused the web, thinking it would get better. IT DID NOT. So, my question is, WHO is leaving positive reviews?"
" Found Footage Horror at its Best!
",0.2003,-0.9897,2018-01-21 00:00:00,9,"I've never been a great fan of the found footage horror genre.... until now! This film is head and shoulders above the likes of Paranormal Activity and the Blair Witch Project right across the board. The acting is great, the story line is unique, and the atmosphere created is just damn right scary. Mostly set in semi-darkness, alike to great Horror Movies such as the original Halloween, the tension built throughout the film is masterful, yet subtle. Plenty of genuinely frightening and creepy scenes that stay with you well after the film has finished. These are sometimes subtle, so pay attention and watch closely for the full affect! Some criticise the ending as being a bit of a let down, however, I believe this isn't the case. What you don't always see leaves the imagination to ponder all kinds of unimaginable horrors which can create nightmares in their own right. And a lot of the time, a glimpse of the horrors that are unfolding is genuinely enough! The feeling of sheer panic in the cast and their doomed attraction visitors is one that will stay with me for a long time!If you're brave enough, watch alone with the lights out! I dare you!"
" Solid and highly enjoyable found-footage effort
",0.5849,0.8625,2017-11-27 00:00:00,8,"Attempting to film a new documentary special, a film-crew looks at the scene of a tragic accident at a retrofitted hotel that was intended to be a Halloween attraction and follows the initial experience a crew trying to prepare the house for the evening which befell a terrifying experience.This here was a rather fun and enjoyable effort. One of the better features here is the fact that this one really manages to generate a strong and impressive atmosphere throughout here. Starting with the initial concept of the film about a collection of videos uploaded by a visitor to a haunted attraction in New York films the gradual descent into terror unleashed against the rest of the patrons as a launching point, this one gets off to a great start as the scenes are rather fun with all the creepy happenings occurring amongst the darkness and the chaos it unleashes starting the atmosphere nicely with these scenes forming a bridge to the fake documentary about the incident which is rather fun. Once it moves away from there into the crew preparing the haunted house and details their experience trying to get things built, this one follows a more traditional found- footage type of film which details their early exploits within the hotel building everything for the occasion as this shows them deciding on the preparations, figuring out how to get the decorations up and going behind-the-scenes of the shoot to really ramp up the atmosphere of the building. That some of the encounters later on in the basement in the house as they set-up, from the encounter with the strobing lights, the disappearing dolls and rearranged rooms leading to the group disappearing as it starts in on what's going to happen to the group. Leading into the opening night performance that ties into the chaos shown earlier gives this a truly enjoyable piece of action that signals a frenetic and crazed final half which is a great way to fully cap off a fine ending note. That these manage to give this a rather strong atmosphere throughout here is what really gives this a lot to like, as the whole thing going wrong leads to a really creepy feel here. While these here manage to hold it up, it does have some problems with it. The biggest issue with this one is the exceptionally slow pacing here that really drains the energy from the film. Not only does that include the scenes of incredibly long time before any of the demonic activity begins that it really begins to feel like the whole affair is slowly being dragged along to a rather slow crawl as the majority of the film doesn't really feature much at all happening. That this is intercut with the cutbacks to the other figures talking about the incident does seem to slow this one down at times. As well, the other big issue with the film is the rather confusing narrative here where it's nearly impossible to tell what's going on at the end, as the action seems to just occur without any kind of explanations. There's not much here that makes sense and it just seems to be freaky incidents without much in the way of explanation or reason and it just makes the whole thing feel confusing as to what's going on more than anything. Otherwise, this one was quite fun.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence."
" Creepy and intense
",0.0772,0.8795,2017-11-21 00:00:00,8,"I'm a more casual fan of the horror genre, so this isn't coming from someone who is ""hardcore"" into the films. A lot of the ""scary"" movies don't phase me much (yet I still enjoy most of them). However, Hell House was a delightful change of pace. It creeped me out and I even had to cover my eyes a bit during some parts. Even though I've never heard of the actors, or the director, it was way better than some of the major motion picture horror films released in the last few years. The plot was also refreshing and I think it would be attractive to a lot of viewers who are looking for something a little different to check out.I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that's creepy, intense, and fun to watch!"
" A grand little film!
",0.5093,0.8349,2017-11-12 00:00:00,10,"There isn't much of a contrived plot here. Instead, a situation unfolds, carrying the viewer along as though she or he was one of the very crew involved in constructing a Halloween haunted tour. The actors were more than skilled enough to make me believe they were real people doing something fun, something they loved doing, but also something that's become too ""easy"", and now they are looking for a new challenge. I liked that.This movie gave me a genuine case of the heebie-jeebies, and no lie. That isn't easy to do. I believe the last time that happened to me was the first time I read Steve King's ""The Shining"", in particular the sequence where Danny is crawling around under the snow in the buried playground equipment. Gaw! I was pleased that the chills stayed with me well into the night. I had to resist the urge to keep the lights on!"
" Great Indie Mock-doc Found footage movie filmed right near my house!
",0.6588,0.9907,2017-11-04 00:00:00,10,"I LOVE this movie! I'm a fan of the found footage/mock-doc genre, despite the over-saturation of such films.One of the reasons I love this do much is that it was actually filmed at an old, shut-down hotel/restaurant about 10 minutes from my house. They actually put on haunts at this place, really named The Waldorf Hotel. I drive past this place on a regular basis. It's in a very tiny town in Northeast PA (I think it's technically considered Palmerton but may be Lehighton, PA.) It's really neat to watch this movie, which I have MANY times now, and press pause, able to clearly recognize the surroundings.Yes, found footage mock-doc movies have been played out. Sadly, they've become that song you really like but come to abhor because of constant radio play. But this movie is a gem in the pile of turds of the vast majority of FF films of late. It's just different. The unknown actors come off as believable. Their characters are well defined, so they really pull off the mock-doc aspect very well. They also have a legit reason for the constant filming in that they're turning a basically condemned property into a top notch Halloween attraction.If you want blood and gore, you won't find it here. If you want jump scares galore, look elsewhere. What makes this indie project great is its subtlety. It's creepy for sure. But you don't need to force your suspension of disbelief to imagine this being a true documentary. If you dig the kind of movie, particularly a horror movie, that doesn't just constantly make you think to yourself, ""Oh, yeah right...come on!"" I suggest you give this a watch. The camera work isn't all shaky, so even if you're not a FF fan, you will most likely enjoy this film. In summary, it's just a fun, creepy, believable, well-acted/directed tale about a haunted house. No CG. No real special effects. Just a very well done, low budget indie horror, though I personally consider it more a thriller. PG: Language"

",-0.2183,-0.9186,2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"This is the first time I've ever been moved to write a review, and I watch A LOT of movies, especially scary ones. Horror movies play on one concept: the unknown, the unexpected, the invisible, the uncertain, the inexplicable and what we all project into that space. In order for a horror movie to be successful, we need to be taken by surprise and when we see the setup coming, still be unsettled and terrified beyond jump scares delayed just a beat longer than expected or a screechy or booming score or amp in volume. Before watching this movie, I said, ""That's a bold premise—an actual haunted house at a haunted house. They're really going to have to deliver."" I have never seen anything so gripping, so full of twists and eerie suspense, with bits and pieces of other sub-genres mixed in so unexpectedly and successfully. First time in many movies that I actually covered my eyes—but of course peaked through— several times during the final 10 minutes. The acting is great, the silence is deafening, and it's just a really well made film."
" Well, the found-footage genre isn't officially dead yet! [+52%]
",0.7035,0.8988,2017-10-05 00:00:00,5,"'Hell House LLC' begins with showing the YouTube video of the opening night of a haunted house attraction that turns awry, the outcome being multiple injuries and fatalities. Director Stephen Cognetti opts for a part documentary-part reality-style in trying to unwrap the mystery behind what really went down that night. The scene quickly switches to interviews on the incident with a journalist, a witness and an author to rack up suspense in the narration.A member of the hell-house team (named Sara) that made it out alive and had been living in exile unexpectedly turns up with a bunch of video-tapes (that showcases a series of unnerving incidents from 46 days prior, up until the disastrous opening night) at the documentary team's hotel. This is where the story actually commences (almost at the 12 minute mark). Alex and his team (his girlfriend Sara, his childhood friend Mac, a couple of acquaintances who joined Alex in his venture - Paul and Tony who are the ones filming the entire adventure at different stages, and 3 new recruits - Joey, Melissa & Sam) are looking to revamp an abandoned hotel (set in a generally uncrowded rural town) into a commercial haunted house attraction. The movie is mostly told from the perspective of Paul - the strange awakenings in the middle of the night, his encounters with a sleepwalking Sara, and his observations of some of the immobile props moving by themselves. The build-up is pretty great, and as one of the characters says in the beginning ""We have half the place done for us already"" - hi5 to that comment, because the place genuinely looks creepy, even during daytime. Even though claustrophobia isn't exactly part of the package, it sortof hits the viewer hard on plenty of occasions (especially when the camera shifts to the basement portion of the house). While the first hour succeeds in raising a fair amount of suspense and thrills, we don't really get the straightforward answers we were seeking by the time the movie is over. Some of the clichés do take over eventually - Alex is NEVER convinced that the place has a daunting vibe to it (not once!), no one believes Paul even when he shows them video evidence of perturbing incidents happening (and believe that he's trying to pull off a tedious prank, good heavens!) and the oh-so- banal climax (not gonna be spoiling it). The movie works well when it places emphasis on frantic, isolated incidents rather than when the group is together (or at least two in number) - for instance the scene where Paul is locked in the basement to test the strobe lights (yikes!); or one of the instances where Paul wakes up in his room in the middle of the night (the best scene in the movie actually - and it comes almost midway).The 'actual incident' part which is repeated again in the climax (with additional footage this time) doesn't come across as the least bit scary - there's music playing in the background, there are too many people on screen running around and screaming, and the camera is too jerky (reminds you of some other badly executed found-footage flicks like the 'Slumber Party: Alien Abduction' segment from 'VHS 2', or one of the latter 'Paranormal Activity' films), and worst, we don't even get a solid peek at the creepy antagonists (what we get instead is a scene lifted from 'REC').Therefore, this movie has its share of flaws but is still worth checking out for a number of legit reasons: the B-movie props, the campy theme (that's not explored into, at all), a couple of excellent jumpscares, and the overall atmosphere. The acting is not bad for a B-movie; it's functional - the Hell House crew do a much better job than the documentary team. Maybe a sequel could help wander a bit into the murky genesis of the haunting.Verdict: Found-footage fanatics can give it a try!"
" Found footage horror done right!
",-0.6114,-0.9894,2017-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Just when you think the found footage horror film has nowhere left to go, the well now running dry after granddaddy of them all The Blair Witch Project's release in 1999, along comes a low-budget gem like Hell House LLC.Directed by debut feature length filmmaker Stephen Cognetti, who edited the film over a course of a full calendar year as he worked another full time job, Hell House may on paper seem like a tough sell but due to the films non-reliance on jump scares and instead a focus on subtle build ups and solid character design and growth, Cognetti's film is an effective example of both low-budget filmmaking and the found footage style of horror film's that has been going through a rough time over the last few years.Setting up a slow build scenario, Cognetti's film draws the audience in as we witness a haunted house crew set-up for a new season of Halloween haunts and scares in a decrepit old hotel building on the outside country surrounds of New York City.Mixing in talking head interviews with journalists and eye-witnesses of a night of terror and death on the Hell House's opening night, the film feels like a lived in and realistic experience as the hotel premise's true nature begins to be unravelled by the production crew and we the audience begin to understand the horrors that the hotel harbors within its bricks and motor design.Most impressive for a film of this nature and budget, Hell House has great production values and extremely solid acting turns which makes the haunted house feel alive and real and rare for a film of this ilk, the characters here are ones we grow to care for and are characters that feel cut from the real world, unlike many found footage film's where characters feel unrealistic and most tellingly, uninvolving.Not everything in Hell House works to the standard it sets, a few plot contrivances and some obvious budget constraints hamper a few scenes and situations but with a focus on the practical (the Hell House is an impressively constructed set-piece for the film) and the stories engaging design, Hell House is an enjoyable and frequently haunting piece of horror filmmaking.Final Say – One of recent memories great little horror surprises, Hell House LLC is the newest found footage experience you didn't know you needed and a splendid calling card for its director Stephen Cognetti, a director who quite clearly is an astute student of the genre and a filmmaker to keep a very close eye on.3 ½ creepy pianist's out of 5"
" Decent found footage horror flick.

I am well aware of the 'found footage' genre that has become a normal horror movie cliché and while I have enjoyed some in the past, a majority of them, I do not like. Hell House LLC is one of the ones I liked. The film is part found footage and part documentary mixed into a sort of surreal horror film. The fact that the film takes place in and around a pop-up Halloween haunted house only allows them to use weird and creepy effects without expecting people to suspend belief.The movie has a decent pace, the actors are your average run of the mill B-Horror cast.The writing is fine, but it's another one of those films that explain nothing and I really hate that."
" Genuinely scary and underrated.
",-0.4939,-0.9051,2017-09-07 00:00:00,7,"Hell House LLC was probably the biggest surprise for me in the found footage genre. The movie flowed well throughout the whole duration, not becoming too boring like some horror movies often do. While there is a lack of character development at the start, they begin to flesh out later on in the film. The story seems believable as well, while some movies may explore a haunted area ""because they want to see what is there"", Hell House LLC sets up a more stable backstory, explaining how setting up haunted houses is a practice for the crew and that they need to go through with it for financial reasons.If you want a found footage horror film and don't want cheesy jump scares then this movie is great for you."

",0.2144,-0.9244,2017-07-27 00:00:00,4,"The introduction is self-explanatory, the movie takes a faux- documentary/found footage angle to explore a mysterious incident involving a famous haunted house. As someone who's not a fan of most found footage movies, I gave this one a chance based on the reviews heralding it as one of the best.First and foremost, the cons of this movie far outweighed the pros. There was poor pacing, unlikeable/underdeveloped characters, lack of scares, and a drawn out ""build up"" to a very disappointing climax. Like most shaky cam movies, there were moments where the camera seemingly twisted in EVERY DIRECTION which is not only unnecessary but unnatural.As others have said, the main problem is that basically the entire film builds up to what you expect to be some cataclysmic event and by the end you are left with virtually nothing. Save yourself the time and skip this one."

" Genuinely Creepy
",0.0,-0.9667,2017-07-21 00:00:00,7,"Not sure what the folks giving the really low reviews were expecting, but for me, this was a genuinely creepy, edge-of-your-seat, horror flick. I tend to like a bit of gore with my horror, of which this has none, but I was, nonetheless, kept interested throughout the film, always wondering what might happen next. If you have a fear of clowns, this isn't going to help you get over it. The film does really well with subtle scares. No clichéd cat-jumping-out-of-a-closet stuff, nor does it need a scary musical score to clue you that it's supposed to be scary. Some might have difficulty handling the hand-held camera viewpoint, but if that doesn't bother you, and you are a fan of the 'found footage' genre, this is worth a look."
" One of the much better found footage horror films
",-0.2023,0.9757,2017-07-21 00:00:00,9,"I saw this on Amazon Prime and was interested in the premise as well as the simple artwork cover for the film. It wasn't trying too hard to look scary.I'd like to review it from a number of standpoints. Firstly the acting. Although I don't think I recognised any of the actors from other films or TV, all were credible and delivered very good performances. Quite often with lesser known films the performances are wooden. Not in this case.The story is the strong point in my opinion. The premise is a group of enterprising young people rent or buy an obscure old hotel that has been closed for 20 years and make it into a haunted house attraction. Little do they know the old building has a back story and the details are well conceived. During the film new pieces of information come to light about the hotel's past.The other strong point is the location. The building (appearance and layout) and the grounds (including the abandoned cars), are creepy and the attractions they add improve the overall effectiveness of the location.The pacing and scares are about right and I get the impression the writer/director and crew are fans of the genre and wanted to get this right.I think they've made a modern day classic and I think the location of the house will soon get some fan pages with pictures on. I'd go visit the outside if I wasn't 4000 miles away.I don't want to say more about the film because it might spoil it.It's quite possibly going straight into my top 10 horror films list.

",0.0,0.0781,2017-07-03 00:00:00,10,"I went into this film with low expectations. The last few found footage ghost movies I had seen had been less than great. Then I watched this. I went immediately watched it again that night with my daughter, then a couple of nights later with my whole family.The story is tightly written and the action keeps pace nicely without feeling rushed. The characters are as well developed as you can get in an hour and a half horror film. They each get their own time to shine, their own issues, relationships, etc. The acting is much better than one usually finds in low budget indie horror. The scares are great and subtle, and that creeping feeling of dread keeps you on the edge of your seat. The effects are all practical, which is fantastic and a fresh change of pace with some of the badly CGI'd ghost effects out there.I cannot wait to see what this group has for us next, because they are talented."
" More indie found footage nonsense
",-0.4019,-0.9364,2017-06-30 00:00:00,2,HELL HOUSE LLC is another film about a bunch of teenagers visiting a creepy abandoned location and running afoul of whatever happens to haunt it. It's a found footage film shot on a zero budget that manages to pad out most of the running time with endless interview clips and walking around footage that does nothing for the viewer. Only about a fifth of the running time is actually concerned with the exploration of the setting and the requisite jump scares that come with it. The rest is all lame small talk.
" A group of friends/colleagues put on their yearly paid Halloween event..Hell House
",0.0,0.95,2017-06-24 00:00:00,10,"Just watched this and how I have not heard about it before is beyond me. This is excellent, very well done / produced. Don't be put off by the fact it is found footage etc, it is not your standard film..more docu-horror. It has been years since I watched a film and felt scared in a heart racing type of way, and i was.. (not helped by my dog jumping over the back of the sofa and barking) What definitely helps is that the cast is actually likable..such a rarity and very engaging. it doesn't rely on gore (thank goodness) and i don't know how this hasn't made it to cinema...it would be a brilliant one to watch at a late night viewing. Very recommend."
" Don't waste your time
",0.3252,-0.34,2017-06-19 00:00:00,1,"Movie isn't shot in NY it's shot in Franklin township right next door to country junction. it's an actual functioning ""Haunted House"". called the Waldorf of fear, used to be a pretty good restaurant. now it's this embarrassing pile of crap movie.. the story is so overdone, not believable at all, all the reviews were prob from friends who made the movie. pure and utter trash. I want my 93 minutes of my life back."
" Better than I thought it would be...
",0.4404,-0.8716,2017-06-10 00:00:00,8,"I'm usually very skeptical about found footage films. Being a horror movie junkie, it's very hard for me to get scared. I'm not going to lie, I was on the edge of my seat and found myself holding my breath at some points. I watched it in the living room with the lights off, and I would occasionally look behind me..that's how much it got under my skin."
" This flew under the radar but deserves so much recognition
",0.0,-0.6255,2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"I was flicking through the horror genre on Amazon and decided to give this a watch, never having heard of it before but immediately intrigued by the movie poster artwork that shows a photo of the 5 main cast members with distorted faces, much like the frightening photo visuals in the fantastic horror movie 'The Ring' from 2002.I was so pleasantly surprised by how good this movie is. It's difficult to separate any of the found-footage films from each other because they all tend to follow the same route, but HELL HOUSE LLC offers some clever twists and turns, with genuine frights that don't feel cheap; the writer/ director has worked hard to keep the suspense building to the point where you're wondering when the characters are going to start figuring things out instead of taking the ""ignorance is bliss"" direction.Given that it's a hand-held camera providing the visuals, I'm sure the naysayers will be sceptical of watching this type of movie because we know how camera work can be shaky and dark. Fortunately, we see clear images in the transition from found footage tapes to interviews with eyewitnesses of the scene. It was filmed in a really thoughtful and clever style, switching back and forth from past to present day - so that the viewers can figure out the mystery as the movie develops.Much like 'The Blair Witch Project', the highlight of the movie is the performances. There are no star names in the cast but they work so hard to make you believe in the frightened reactions to the house and the tension between them all is palpable as the horror builds. I would definitely say that HELL HOUSE LLC is up there with 'TBWP' and 'As Above, So Below' as the best that the found footage genre has to offer."
" This is not Horror. This is HORRID.
",-0.3038,-0.8954,2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"Somebody must be paying a bundle to get all the positive reviews for this horrid film. To call it a film is actually an insult to ALL film.This is 'Participation Trophy Movie-making'. It's the result of people who are worse than mediocre being told they are 'special' all their life, so they never tried to better themselves.There is no plot to critique. Nor can you critique the acting because the camera work is so wretched and the dialogue so lacking, you can't tell if anybody can actually act. NOTE: 'Found Footage' and subjective camera work doesn't mean you are having a seizure while operating the camera. This entire 'movie' is built around having access to an abandoned building. The 'found footage' scourge that 'Blair Witch' started is so played out, it's ridiculous and Netflix needs to start having people SCREEN THEIR MOVIES to find out if they conform to some MINIMUM quality requirement. At least 'Blair Witch' had a strong storyline and good acting. This rehash has none of that. Don't waste your time. You've already seen this concept done much better."
" Mask Mileage
",0.0,-0.0297,2017-05-28 00:00:00,7,"This film is a very solidly put together found footage horror that uses the documentary style to good effect. There are a decent amount of scares and it manages to remain creepy throughout, even if it relies on the same methods to do so.There isn't much originality in the story, but they make good use of what they have, although a bit more interesting or engaging character work might have elevated the movie from just being a simple scare-fest.Overall this should be enjoyable for horror fans and scary enough to freak out non-fans without being too alienating through high-concept or gore, just don't expect anything revolutionary."
" The Hell House October Also Built
",-0.6808,-0.9948,2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"Found Footage movies are a hit and miss, more often the shakiness of the camera tends to be a distraction, but there are those instances when the cameras flawed views work for the subject. Hell House LLC has been compared to The Houses October Built as both focus on Commercial Haunted Houses, but Hell House is more similar to Lake Mungo in that multiple video sources are used to create a documentary feel. The setting of Hell House is important as it is an actual commercial Haunted House, so the creepiness of the setting adds to the genuine feel of the events. What makes Hell House stand out is the seemingly mysterious way the horrible events of its fatal opening are presented, making efficient use of Youtube and Cell Phone videos we view the panic of the situation along with the mystery of what exactly is going on. The movie does slowly reveal what did happen but also leaves some mystery for the viewer to ponder. Most reviews of the film agree that Hell House is unique and does not seem too derivative among the dozens of recent found footage films. The only area of the debate centers on the ending; you will either love it or hate depending on how much closure you seek. Overall Hell House LLC is a terrific film, and for its small budget, it compares well with bigger budget films that focus more on FX and less on the plot."
" In my top ten found footage list
",0.2023,0.9926,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Firstly let me say that I love all found footage, mockumentry and shaky cams. I will even sit through the bad ones but will always rate accordingly.I really enjoyed this movie. Personally, I liked it even better than House's October Built. I had shivers up my spine even before anything started to happen, the atmosphere was superb and the acting top notch.I like that they did not rely too heavily on jump scares (boring) and that a lot of the creepiness was observed in the background and during camera pans and turns. I know that a lot of FF movies use this tactic but the director was able to get the most out of it, employing it to the best of its ability. It wasn't over-used and the fact that you sometimes knew you were going to see something creepy in the background made it even creepier and suspenseful.There are some comments on the messages boards about plot holes and I agree that there are some explanations missing from the movie but in my opinion FF works better this way. I don't want everything explained and wrapped up in a neat bow, not knowing every last detail of what, why, and who works better for me. It keeps me thinking.If you think about it, any sort of filmed footage of a real horrific event would probably have parts of the story missing, so to me, some blanks in a story make it much more realistic."
" Amazing found footage with great actors
",0.836,0.9724,2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Being a found footage lover, I was puzzled to discover this title just yesterday, as it is very rarely that a subgenre flick goes through my radar unnoticed. And what a great surprise! I absolutely LOVED it! The story is an original take on ff, and it totally made me feel like I was watching what ""The Houses October Built"" should have been - or, at least, what I had hoped it to be before actually checking it out - and it had me hooked from the very beginning. They really knew what they were doing with this one: the use of various sources to add up bits of information progressively was very smart, as it kept things interesting and evolving all the time. The different footage from various people reminded me of how ""The Blair Witch Project"" built up the suspense regarding the mystery from many interviews, making the story decentralized and, therefore, with a more realistic feel to it. Also, the basement was an instant TBWP kind of homage. And it does not stop there: I feel like the script was so good and made use of the material in such a way that there was nothing more I could expect from the movie when it ended. And, ultimately, that is what I want from a movie, to be fully entertained. I even felt the urge to go online and search the history of the Abaddon hotel, and I really wish that, as with TBWP, there was fictional material online to expand on the movie's plot. And this is one of the very few ff movies to feature so many hot guys - I tried not to, but I had to point that out."
" So much better than the new Blair Witch
",0.1725,-0.96,2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"It is so much better than Blair Witch. That movie is not even scary.Someone recommended this movie on the board of Blair Witch. So I checked it out, and it is great.It is wonderful that the mystery of Hell House was approached from three angles. At first, it was shown through interviews and tourists' YouTube videos. The opening drew me in with that question of what really happened in Hell House on the night of the incident. The interviews with witnesses and a photographer nicely built up suspense.Then in the second part, a survivor, Sarah reached out to a documentarian and provided new footage of how Hell House came to be through the eyes of the management team, which showed truly disturbing things. At the climax, scenes are well connected with precious videos, answering some questions.The final part was done from the perspective of the documentarian, who visited the Hell House. There was a twist that brought the movie to a stunning conclusion.The atmosphere is well done. The mannequin looks creepier than Leatherface. The scenes of Paul waking up to find himself haunted and cowering beneath the quilt remind me of the short horror movie Lights Out.PS: Why are there always white Anglo-Saxon males who are portrayed like punks or assholes, and female characters who are damsels in distress in horror movies? It seems there is a formula. Are people really like that in real life?"
