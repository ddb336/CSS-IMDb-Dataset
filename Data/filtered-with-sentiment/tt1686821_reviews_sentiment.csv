" A bad adaptation
",-0.5423,-0.9018,2021-04-05 00:00:00,2,"The two stars I gave this movie were for the costume design for the school uniforms and the filmography. I've never read the books, but the pieces I missed from the movie were the details that i'm sure the books included. The exposition is confusing and weak and it's confusing how some characters have powers and others don't. Why? Where did their powers come from? Why are the two characters connected? There's no explanations of why anything happens. It's painfully obvious the info in the books were chopped up and thrown into this movie, because the plot is so disconnected and yet seems so fast. I don't know what the main character's motives or past are besides their shared trauma and I agree with the reviewers that say there's no chemistry between the cast at all. None of the movie makes me want to figure it out, either; I don't care what happens to our main characters because they never established why we should. I'm sure the books were okay - I'm past YA fiction now but I can see how the plot could be convincing and compelling in a novel setting, but this adaptation is bad."
" Pure disappointment.
",-0.5106,-0.9099,2021-01-19 00:00:00,1,"I like Zoey Deutch, I think she has the potential to do far greater films than she has, but this one certainly clearly didn't help her career.Movies with voice overs are rarely any good, it's a cheap way to tell a story, when you have a director who has no idea how to tell a story.The movie tries too hard to create a lore filled world, throwing stuff at you before you have chance to understand what's going on.And then there's the academy. Hogwarts for vampires. Or was it acting school? Because every last one of them needed acting lessons.I couldn't finish the movie. I hate when I don't watch a movie all the way through, but I also hate having my senses destroyed by drivel..."

" Movie was okay
",0.2263,0.9091,2020-12-14 00:00:00,6,"I have read the books, and read all the bad reviews about this movie before I watched it. Therefore I had NO expectations when I watched it, therefore I wasn't disappointed. Yes it wasn't close to as good as the amazing books, and the acting wasn't good. Although I know that some of these actors are brilliant in other things, which makes me think it's not really the actors fault for their poor acting, but rather the rushed scenes and writing of the scripts. Yes it was very rushed. In the book, each scene is so detailed and long, but here, each scene is very rushed. That's what happens when you make such a great book into a movie. If they made it into a tv series instead, I am sure they would have had more time to show everything, which means it would have been much better! In my opinion, that's what makes the movie seem cheap."
" UNBELIEVABLY bad!
",-0.702,0.7269,2020-12-08 00:00:00,1,"Honestly, I don't see how anyone over the age of 10 can think this tripe is anything near entertaining or even watchable. It's honestly probably the worst film I've ever seen. The script, the acting, the production value is all just awful. Just plain cringe worthy."
" Bloody good
",0.0,0.8625,2020-11-12 00:00:00,7,I can't believe the reviews am reading about this film i haven't read the books that this film was based on. But what i can tell you is that this film is definitely worth a watch with a nice twist at the end
" Not good enough
",-0.3412,0.3687,2020-11-10 00:00:00,1,"Horrible adaptation from the Vampire Academy book series. There was no chemistry between the main characters, Rose and Dimitri. It felt like the film was rushing through the 1st book's storyline.It would have been better if they didn't bother making this adaption. Now the chances of getting sequels or even a new adaptation are 0%"
" So bad that Twilight looks Oscar-worthy in comparison
",-0.5849,-0.156,2020-10-30 00:00:00,1,"Yes, I really did say that.
The VA books are AMAZING. Hands down, one of the best book series I have ever read and I've read a lot. Every detail in the books, even the obvious plot holes, are amazing and you will be drawn in from the first chapter.
But this movie? Having spikes hammered under your nails for 2 hours is less painful than watching the VA movie.
Casting is sooooo wrong. Rose seems like a snotty brat and Lissa like a stuck up ... Dimitri has somewhat of what he has in the books, but not even close to it anyway. Christian is probably the best casting choice, but I suspect that its Dominic's superior acting abilities in play more than the actual casting choice. Dont even get me started on Mason, Jesse, Victor, Mia or Natalie. No. Just no. Kirova I can live with. Even Tatiana I can live with. But the rest? No. I'm so glad they didn't get to cast Adrian because that would have ruined the books for me.
The script.. oh god, how many horrible words can I find to describe the problem with the script? Not enough. Sorry fans. It's just that bad.
Save yourself the horror: don't watch the movie. Read the books. Thank me later."
" At least it's entertaining
",0.4404,0.6301,2020-10-19 00:00:00,4,"Vampire Academy is far from great. It suffers with its fast pace, confusing topics, bad characters, and a terrible script. The story itself isn't so awful but the characters just don't make it fun.
The main love interest, Dimitri, was so bad. His acting was flat. I could clearly see the other actors/actresses trying their hardest, though.
The music selection for this movie was terrible and did not fit the movie at all. However, I will say that the directing and fight scenes were great.
At least it's entertaining."
" Great book
",0.6249,-0.6778,2020-08-03 00:00:00,6,"Sad about the movie, it just didn't live up to the book. This could have been a really special piece, unfortunately it didn't do it for me sadly"
" ""There's a compliment in there somewhere""
",0.4767,0.59,2020-07-07 00:00:00,5,"I loved the books as a teenager, I don't know why it took me six years to get around to watching the movie but I didn't miss out on much, I'll tell ya that!
It's a high school movie disguised as a fantasy/thriller, plain and simple, but that's fine
It's not terrible... until it is. I would've even said I liked it until the cringe speech at the end by Lissa, cutting off the queen during the assembly and preaching about how teenagers shouldn't be catty. God, that's an oxymoron if I've heard any.
5 stars are for Zoey Dutch and her charisma. She did what she could with what she was given and I'm only sorry that we won't see more of her as Rose (and Dimitri calling her Roza *swoons in Russian*) eventhough I'm glad there isn't a sequel.
So yeah, it's nothing on the books but we already knew that didn't we."
" Where do I even start...
",0.0,-0.9785,2020-06-12 00:00:00,1,"I tend towards being kind. Actually that's a lie, but I do try not to be overly harsh. Let me start by pointing out that I have no idea what it takes to direct or produce a movie. In saying that, I am thoroughly disappointed by this film. I weep at the direction they went. They could have approached this like the Harry Potter movies where some parts from the books are missing (enough not to slow down the feel of the film). However that is not how it went. Instead they butchered the series to the point where they could fit every book into one movie. In doing so it plays out like a chaotic mess which may have been directed by someone with ADHD. It could have been a franchise but instead it sank like the titanic after hitting an iceberg (the iceberg in this case being the script).
On to the list of problems... hopefully in orderFirst, Lissa feeding on rose in the first few minutes... in the book rose is conflicted with the feeding. Becoming addicted to it yet hating the craving for it all the same. I didn't get this vibe at all. Honestly it was like Lissa bit through her skin, pulled away, and voila sedated.Issue number two, a scene away from the first issue. Rose sees the guardians from the window (right enough to what the book portrays) but the roommate guy who Lissa controls for his car keys is absent. The back and forth in the book where this happens explains how wrong their society feels this gift is to use, and is a glimpse into what Lissa and her race can do. Even if you feel this isn't important to the movie the next part also gets it wrong. Her meeting with Demetri is wrong. I honestly cannot go into each flaw because this is becoming an overly long review as it is, so just take my word for it (I've read the series 4 times I think I know).Jump right into the mistakes following and I'll be shortThe arrival at the school did not go as the books did, then the teacher who also has control over spirit is somehow already gone from the school (here is where we start jumping books and mashing tidbits into the script so you can try to keep up with the plot), then Christian enters into the mix, followed by the evil uncle, and a budding romance has already begun to build between demetri and rose which is fast even by Hollywood standards.As you can see we have already left the greatness of the written series behind, and believe me when I say it continues on this way until the end of the movie.On a side note the actors and actresses do not portray the characters as they are written. Rose in this movie is timid and more childish, lissa is more deadpan and less depressed or socially awkward, and Mia also overly childish and the comebacks that come out of her mouth are just....ugh.No offense to the actor playing demetri but I don't feel he fits the roll either.This is mostly the first 30 minutes of the movie, and as I said, the review seems a bit too long as is. I will stop here with nuances of my disenjoyment (yep made that a word).Suffice to say if you read the series you may feel as I do about this particular movie. However, if you are within a younger age group (anything 13 and under maybe) and haven't read the books you may just like it.. weirder things have happened."
" The cringe was amazing
",0.5859,0.8402,2020-05-30 00:00:00,4,The movie was super cringey and laughable that i decided on 4 instead of 2 stars... loved every bit of the cringey parts of the movie which is to say everything single part of it
" Not good...
",0.0,0.8921,2020-03-18 00:00:00,3,"""Vampire Academy"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a girl who is Dhampir (half human-half vampire) trying to protect the Moroi (mortal vampires) from the Strigoi (immortal Vampires). The Moroi are living within our world in a peaceful way and they don't make their presence notable.Since I didn't have high hopes or expectations from this movie I wasn't disappointed by it. I didn't like this movie because it has a very boring plot with many filler scenes that make it even more boring. The direction which was made by Mark Waters lacks action. About the interpretations of the cast I don't have to mention any since everyone made poor interpretations. I have to mention here that I haven't read the book but I am definitely sure that the book would be far better than this movie so, if you have already read the book I advise you not to watch this movie. As it can be easily understood I don't recommend anyone watching this movie because you will lose your time and there are far better movies with vampires to watch."
" I see why people hate it, but I really liked it
",0.4194,0.9367,2019-12-23 00:00:00,6,"This movie isn't by any means an award wining film, but I really enjoyed it. I remember reading the books years ago and it brought back the same feeling.While the comedy in it was cheesy and bad and not good I found myself laughing, and I really liked the people casted in the movie.I can definitely see why people hate this film, but I enjoyed it even though it's not exactly similar to the books."
" Definitely gonna watch it again
",0.4019,0.9231,2019-11-30 00:00:00,7,"This movie sucks you in completely. Yeah it goes a bit fast, but it was fun to watch. Hope there will be a sequel :)"

However, I actually liked it. The movie was very cheesy and it actually kept some components from the book. I absolutely loved it and am all for the sequel."
" I've waited 5 years to write this review!
",0.0,-0.9271,2019-08-13 00:00:00,1,"Picture this: It's 2014 and you're 15 years old and your dad wants to get a movie in your demographic. He also is aware that this movie is an adaptation of a book and thinks ""maybe if she likes this movie she will want to read the book."" Unfortunately he was wrong. I remember hating every minute of this movie. Every character was conceded and had no real motivation. The acting was mediocre and sloppy. When I first looked at the IMDB rating, it was at 4.8, which to me, was livable. However, it has gone up over the years and it has fueled a 5-year-long fire that raged within my soul. If anyone were to ask me what my least favorite movie of all time was, this is it and I'm gonna put a stop to this rating rise."
" The books are awesome, but this movie missed the seriousness of the book
",-0.1406,0.9655,2019-08-09 00:00:00,8,"I give a high score, because if you haven't read the book first it is a good comedy. Even when I watched it 5 years after reading the series I found it good.
BUT if you first read the book and then watch the film, it is so dissapointing. It seems like they tried to twist a very serious situation in the book into a funny comedy, it really gives off the wrong feelings.Hopefully some people enjoy the movie and then buys the book. The book series is one of the best I know!"
" I love this movie
",0.6369,0.9647,2019-07-26 00:00:00,10,I really wish they would make the rest of the books into movies. I absolutely love this movie. Rose is amazing and Zoey Deutch is perfect for her! PLEASE MAKE THE REST OF THE MOVIES!!!!
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.2612,2019-07-10 00:00:00,4,"The premise is interesting enough and the main characters have the ""quirky"" personality going for them. It should've been a decent film but the writing and pacing made it a horrible mess. Everything was moving too fast and left me wondering if some of the scenes were even necessary. Another thing I dislike about this movie is how they portray teenagers and sl*t-shame everybody. I never read the book but after looking at an interview of the author saying how the movie does it justice, I'm glad I didn't waste my time."
" A bit different from any other Vampire stories.
",0.0,-0.9888,2019-05-14 00:00:00,4,"Most of the reviews are saying how much this film is bad. And also they are complaining that this film is terrible. As for me, I don't think this film is either good or bad. It makes me difficult to write review on this one because I also don't know how to judge.Basically, this film is about vampires. But it's more than Vampire. It indeed has extra things. So, sometimes, it makes me really confused. I must admit that this film really bad in some conditions. And sometimes, it's totally nonsense. But it's not that terrible. At least, I still can watch it.There's only one thing I don't like. They shouldn't write anything that ridicule the other Vampire stories such as Twilight. I think this film will be better if there is no such part in it.Because of the rating on this film, they don't even do a sequel. And this film doesn't have an end. So, it seems like it's stranded. I kind of don't like it. I really don't care about ratings, I really want to see the ending. No matter how much it is bad, if only there's an end, it's better.All in all, compared to other Vampire films, this film is nothing. That being said, it doesn't mean this film is unwatchable. At least it doesn't make me boring, well, I think it's at the normal."
" More entertaining then expected
",0.4927,0.9501,2019-04-08 00:00:00,7,I found this to be harmless fun. The 2 main girls did well with their roles. Was great action and funny dialogue. It did go too long though and i got bored towards end. I'd really love to see a sequel.
" Read the books/miss the movie
",0.0,-0.2483,2019-04-07 00:00:00,5,"The movie had the potential to be amazing, maybe even better if it was a tv series but the acting in this was not so good and the script was awful, Lissa is a completely different character in the books, not so moany and that accent omg and the actor playing dimitri doesn't really pull it off either, shame as the books are awesome"
" ""Bad"" Doesn't Begin To Cover It
",0.0,-0.8243,2019-03-21 00:00:00,3,"There are a couple of good ideas battling for focus here, but all of them ultimately fall short in a swamp of suffocatingly contrived exposition, poor editing and incredibly choppy pacing. Though the fight sequences are entertaining enough, while unconvincingly choreographed, they are too few and far between to prevent this feeling like an appallingly sub-par highschool drama with none of the charm of Mean Girls before it; and as a fan of the mythology, I'm left to wonder if it's really Twilight that's done the most damage to vampires since the turn of the millennium after all."
" amazing
",0.5859,0.9779,2019-02-01 00:00:00,10,"I put this on thinking it would make a good background movie while i did something else. Wow, it was so much better than the trailer. Who ever did the promotion for it seriously failed. The actors are amazing and talented and its fast paced and funny in the right ways. The script is flawless and i never once got bored or felt the need to skip ahead. I thought it might be all teenager pettyness and drama but not at all. The characters don't do dumb things and the plot is clever and exactly what a good movie/book should be. I have watched it again and again and its been a really long time since i liked a movie that much."
" My only regret
",-0.4215,0.5106,2019-01-26 00:00:00,10,Is that they didn't make more of the movies I'm staying hopeful
" A great new take on the genre
",0.6249,-0.8851,2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"VA may not have the most realistic fight scenes, but it more than makes up for this with its unique take on the vampire genre, coupled with characters you can't help but love. You just get engrossed in the world of VA and can't help wanting more."
" Tries to be cool, but falls flat on its face
",0.1655,0.5215,2018-12-31 00:00:00,2,"Vampire Academy is impressive the way it over-explains everything, yet says nothing of substance. This movie tries so hard to prove that it's cooler than the movies it's ripping off, but it's constantly tripping over its own feet and falling flat on its fangs. From the melodramatic acting to the paper-thin plot to the cheesy special effects, this movie is one big misfire."
" THINKING IS FOR LOSERS
",-0.5267,0.8,2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,"Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) is a Dhampir, half human/vampire. She guards Lissa Dragomir (Lucy Fry) a Moroi. The Moroi are peaceful mortal vampires who perform magic based on the elements. Rose guards Lissa from bloodthirsty, immortal Vampires, the Strigoi. Rose steals Lissa, who is also a princess, from the academy as they hide out, only to be discovered and returned to St. Vladimir, the Hogwarts for vampires.Like the Harry Potter series, in addition to dealing with serious life and death issues, our girls must cope with being a teen and all the puns that go with being a vampire. Yes, the stakes are high. Zoey Deutch gives us a refreshing performance and I haven't been so much in love since Jordana Brewster in D.E.B.S. The plot has some good unveiling.This is fun teen film.Parental Guide: No nudity. One near F-bomb. Brief sexual situations"
" Mess of a movie
",-0.3612,0.765,2018-07-30 00:00:00,1,"I enjoyed the book series when I read it, but the movie was just awful. The characters that you care for in the novels are completely unlikeable in the film. The entire time I spent watching this movie, I couldn't care less about the characters. Super slow-paced, confusing (plot is different from that of the novels and many things are left out) and just terrible overall. Read the books instead."
" Awful awful and it brings shame to the books
",-0.8442,-0.1352,2018-02-25 00:00:00,3,The books are probably one of my favourite series out there. I was really excited for the screen adaptation only to be met with one of the worst movies ever made. Everything is cheesy and they skip so many important parts. Shame. They should redo it with the right actors who had 0 chemistry and a whole better director.
" The promise to be amazing but they failed it
",-0.34,0.9931,2017-11-19 00:00:00,1,"I really wanted to like this. I am an avid fan of the books but unlike a lot of avid fans, I am realistic. I don't diss movies because they don't follow the books. I am realistic enough to know that an imagination is going to trump budget, location and time constraints every single time. And as much as I really wanted to have the entire series made into movies, if they think about follow on's they need to have a good hard think. The movie itself had two trailers. One was a mean girls, laugh a minute, spoof which looked dreadful and the second was darker. So it was my hope that OK, directors of the mean girls wasn't going to be a good advertisement but maybe the found a way to combine all the elements. It didn't. The book series is excellent. Its not sparkly vampires, think more The originals than Twilight. Its dark, its serious, but there are some excellently written light hearted Rose Hathaway moments. The dhampir who conforms to nobody and isn't afraid to rebel. What did we get? Canned laughter type moments, moments that should have been funny but weren't. More a Disney type channel comedy aimed at children. I get it should appeal to non book readers, to people who have never ever heard of Richelle Mead, but that went so far the other way there is no surprise it bombed. Such a shame, such a let down for something that could have been better than all the movies that came before."
" Overall, an OK movie
",0.4466,-0.9762,2017-10-06 00:00:00,4,"I feel like they had many really attractive people in this movie to make up for the bad acting skills. But some scenes were not too bad. I think the actors were not good at expressing sadness, shock, or anger. There were also quite a lot of actors that I have seen before in this movie. It is not terrible, but not the best movie I have ever seen (actually not even close). It is funny, because the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was such a good movie, but the second time I watched it, i really had a lot of criticize about it."
" Well done popcorn flick
",0.2732,0.997,2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Yes, the movie is cheesy. But I have the advantage on not having read the books and enjoying it unbiased. The movie screams ""Young Adult novel adaption"" in all directions, but it is absolutely refreshing in a world full of YA dystopias. The movie is fun and light-hearted. The actors are great (especially Rose is reminding me of a younger Detective Rizzoli and Lissa is full of grace) and very likable. The movie feels a bit rushed, it tries to put a lot of plot points into a movie that would have felt better in a series' season. It is clear this is a book adaption and as such you have to fill in some blanks by yourself, like the road-trippy shopping mall event that distracts from the main plot and feels out of place. It's not the most genius movie and some things are quite obvious, but it is a _well done_ movie with good characters, entertaining interactions, and a nice narrative. I was afraid some of the characters would fall flat (especially Dimitri) but it turned out they were well characterized. The two main actors are especially good as presenting two girls who share a deep and joyful I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was - a leisure time flick, not Shakespeare. As such I can recommend it without a doubt. It was a lot of fun and bettered my mood."
" Wow ever heard of subtly guys
",0.5859,0.9657,2017-03-29 00:00:00,1,"Now I love the books but even as a standalone movie this is awful. The editing is rushed and makes no sense, one scene Rose is climbing out a window and without even a cutaway or anything in between we get Rose and Jesse about to make out.The characters are sort of like they are in the book but there is far too much attitude. Lissa is meant to be gentle and kind and although the darkness from the spirit does get to her she never takes it out on Rose like THAT. Rose is OK, her behaviour is pretty close to the book and one of the only characters who should be behaving like that. Kirova, my god I just, I was stunned at how aggressive she was being. In the book she's frustrated and doesn't quite understand the situation with Rose and Lissa, she threatens to send Rose to the blood whores but she treats Rose like that because she broke the rules not because she hates and loathes her with every ounce of her very being. OK movie we get it we need to hate her, especially when she pulls out the syringe, seriously movie. Lastly we have Queen Tatania, first of all the Queen is supposed to come in when they are all sat down at tables and the Queen will move around chatting to the Royals if she wants to, its considered a great honour to have the Queen stop and talk to you so that's why its a big slap in Lissa's face when the Queen SUBTLY says while commenting on the power of her names that the name does not make a person. She doesn't just point and scold and she definitely doesn't mention the dead animals (Why the cat, it was a bird in the book), its not meant to be private it is meant to be overheard but she doesn't just say it outright and then she goes on to say I hope you'll turn it around somehow, just no.No, just no, you got the Strigoi right guys good job but um YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE THEM UNTIL THE END OF THE MOVIE or at least ROSE ISN'T. That's why she loses the fight at the end not just because its Natalie but because she's the first Strigoi she's ever faced but no you had to introduce them at the very beginning so the audience knows about the 3 types of vampire. You couldn't have just I don't know showed the Strigoi attacking someone who is not Rose.Lastly, there was no mention of Dhampir's biology and genetics. No acknowledgement to why Dhampir's exist and why they protect Moroi which I would think is pretty damn important to the plot especially for Dimitri and Rose as the reason they shouldn't get together isn't just Lissa's safety.I just don't understand why they added so much that wasn't in the book, rivals that don't exist and the cliffhanger at the end makes no sense if you know about Strigoi and how they live.But one thing I liked, a teeny weeny bit, was the last action scene because of Rose's talk with Victor and Natalie as Strigoi was pretty cool, I especially liked when it cut back to Rose and you could see the guardians dying in the background."
" Not what I hoped for!
",-0.3561,-0.887,2017-03-19 00:00:00,3,"I was looking forward to the release of Vampire Academy. I had read each of the books thoroughly and was anticipating seeing each character and plot come to life on the big screen. What we got instead was Mean Girls with fangs.While most people seemed to blame the bad movie on the cast of (at the time) lesser known actors, I blame it entirely on the writers. Instead of actually delving into the books and writing a script that paid credence to Richelle Mead's writing, they gave us the same ""Plastic"" drivel that comes from any Waters Brothers movie.If this movie had been written and directed as it should have been, this would have been the beginning of a long lasting movie franchise. Instead we get this one movie flop and may never get the chance to see a ""proper"" adaptation on the big screen within our lifetime."

WOW, let me preface by saying I really do enjoy movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt. But watching this movie took every ounce of my will to live. The actors are horrible, the plot is as stupid as it can get, and you literally HOPE more of the main characters die because god knows it would make this movie a little more interesting. ANYTHING, if ANYTHING could redeem this movie, it would be Zoey Deutch's character because at least she has some inkling of a personality, her quips are sharp, and she's got moves. But literally that ray of sunshine is drown in this pile of horse poop. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH FOR YOUR OWN SANITY. Consider this a warning."
