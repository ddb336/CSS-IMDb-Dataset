" Dont compare, just enjoy this different version!! Excellent chariot race!!
",0.5007,0.9892,2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,"People are as usual over critical of a a re make I call them re told , all of our movies are made with different directors and no 2 people are the same so its impossible for the 2 movies to be the same. Cecil de was brilliant and had the fortunate situation of doing what he did in an era where such movies could be made that way thus no re telling can equal his but this version is excellent, its extremely entertaining, well directed and you get a great pay off at the end. Highly recommend you watch this film but dont compare it to any other film. Enjoy what the great cast and crew created for you."
" mediocre - pure garbage. Romans count in Arabic numbers... unhistorical.
",0.0,-0.4854,2021-04-10 00:00:00,1,"Puerile behaviors and trivial dialogues. Childish emotions by characters. Ben Hur discovers the possibility to love his enemy without any reason because his relationship with Jesus is fleeting and the movie doesn't explain it. Events happen just because have to happen until the run of chariots. Many emphatic sentences with effect but of empty meaning. Superficial, and pathetic script. I save just the scenography."

In this remake, The Chariot Race is every bit as exciting as the original - if not better.I don't see why a well established actor like Morgan Freeman with 'numerous' accolades & awards under his belt, is so far down the pecking order line up of cast credits."

" great storyline and action, but lacks authenticity
",0.3716,0.5131,2020-08-17 00:00:00,8,"The re-make has a great storyline and action, but the characters such as morgan freeman lack true authenticity, (i.e. speaking in fluent english dialect and tongue). They needed to find actors with more authentic backgrounds to fill some of the various parts to create a more authentic feel throughout the movie. Overall, well done for a 2000s movie. Not sure why critics give is such low scores. Scenes such as that from the war ships, likely did happen, which is downright brutal, but true to the period and time in history! Scary to think about! Great chariot race scene!"

" Shockingly Good
",0.296,0.9821,2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"As someone with no previous exposure to any other version of the story, this movie was great. It was a blind purchase and, from the beginning, the expectation was for an entertaining movie without much more. What it ultimately provided was something well worth re-watches in the future.
The acting in this film is wonderful. The dialogue is strong and every single one of the actors rises to the challenge, creating believable drama, heartwarming reconciliations and emotionally charged falling outs. Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell both present flawed yet redeemable characters in a brotherly relationship that you want to see work itself out throughout the film.
This film uses religious imagery and themes at times but never once comes off as being preachy, which is something the entire Christian film industry could learn a lot from. Instead, what we get is a universal story of brotherly love, betrayal and reconciliation that resonates regardless of religious affiliations.
The chariot race sequence was absolutely thrilling, with stakes raised as high as they could possibly go thanks to Morgan Freeman's character. It keeps you on the edge of your seat.The only serious issue this film has is the camera work, particularly when it comes to action sequences. Many people compared it to The Hunger Games, although this is still watchable despite its handheld camera feeling. It needed a tripod and a little bit more diligent decision-making in the shooting of some of the scenes, but this was a great movie. I really enjoyed it and will be returning to it again in the future."

" Definitely Underrated. A Must-See Hidden Gem
",0.4019,0.2006,2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,This movie immersed me more than Gladiator did. It gave me goosebumps like that of what I've experienced during the battle of Helm's Deep or the battle of Thermopylae in 300. This movie was thoroughly enjoyed by my wife who isn't a movie buff. All the hate is coming from the fans of the original. I've seen the original and I was immersed in it as a kid. This 2016 version immersed me even as a 30 year-old adult. That's saying something.
" Revival well done
",0.2732,0.891,2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,A strong story from my early days. A strong direction with a good set of actors. Well done.
" Not awful, just not very good either...
",-0.0369,0.6461,2020-04-12 00:00:00,5,"This has one considerable difference from the multi-award winning version from 1959 - it is nowhere near as long. Otherwise , Jack Huston ""Judah"" and Toby Kebbell ""Messala"" turn in decent enough performances as we skip through, quite jauntily, General Lew Wallace's ""Tale of the Christ"". Make no mistake, it has none of the superior production qualities nor the style of it's previous incarnation - the CGI outperforms anything else on the screen and as such what we get is largely sterile - especially the battle scene at sea with the Silesian pirates - with a very limited chemistry between the two men, and also between ""Judah"" and a rather wooden Morgan Freeman as ""Sheikh Ilderim"". As remakes go, however, it is nowhere near as bad as some I have seen and though I really cannot see $100 million dollars in this effort, it might just stimulate interest in the original and that'd be no bad thing."
" Beautiful interpretation of an epic story
",0.5994,0.9595,2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,"It's not easy to follow in the footsteps of one of the most venerated films of all time - a film blessed by the pope, but this film is a worthy interpretation of the epic. It varies in a few significant ways from the orignal film (and both vary dramatically from the book ). It's important to note upfront that this version is much more concise.This version focuses on the relationship between Judah and Messala from beginning to end. It gives the film focus the whole way through. It even skips Judah's entire stint in Rome, making the story concise and directed. The main theme is the struggle between revenge and forgiveness. Jesus' role is poetically streamlined as a catalyst in Judah's arc.The famous chariot scene is intense and climactic. You can feel the excitement, stress, and chaos in the circus. In the book (and original film), the race occurs much earlier in the story: book 5 of 8. In the 2016 version, the race is the climax leading to the beautiful end that follows.Don't be deterred by some of the hateful reviews I've seen online. This modern interpretation is focused and powerful. It is now my favorite version. It's well worth the watch."
" Not that bad

If you compare it to the original it's not something ground-breaking. But if you put the comparison aside, you will like it. its a good story and the acting for the most part is good. its an ok remake and definitely not as bad as make it seem to be"

",0.0,0.9381,2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"I think this is my first review after years, but I just think that most of the qualifications are done comparing the original. Please, there is no comparison, but that doesn't mean that is a very well done movie. I have qualified over 2000 and I think I have some criteria. Give it a chance jajajaja the original is much better, but this one deserves more than 7."
" A Shaky Ride to a Solid Finish
",-0.0772,0.9845,2020-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Admittedly, re-telling the story of Ben-Hur in modern cinema seems remarkably unnecessary since the original film was already so good in it's own merit. But to say that this is a bad movie would be a lie. There are plenty of powerful moments that portray betrayal and survival with its dialogue staying engaging and competent. Convincing acting from Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell helps establish a heartfelt brotherhood of joy and sadness that shines in key moments in all three acts. Even the supporting cast does a solid job establishing the tention of the conflict at hand. A serviceable soundtrack and action set pieces build to a good climax as well. I do agree with most that Timur Bekmambetov's frequent ""free style"" camera control is distracting with the consistent shaking and close-up shots rob what could have been sweeping epic shots to fuel the emotions of the film better. And the way some dialogue is delivered falls flat when the passage of time or awkward pacing steals their thunder. And of course, it's worth confirming that the CGI scenes are...pretty bad at times. In the end, why fix what isn't broken? It's tough to live up to an already fantastic film, and this 2016 adaptation of Ben-Hur will likely drown in history as another ""Hollywood cash-grab"". But if the story of Ben-Hur resonates within your soul, this adaptation is worth at least a single view."
" Weak remake of classic movie
",-0.4404,-0.7436,2020-02-22 00:00:00,6,"I watched this remake of the 1959 movie Ben Hur. This version was made in 2016. Unlike the 1959 movie which is considered one of best movies ever made, this recent remake is a weak albeit entertaining version of the earlier movie. The newer movie contains several changes in the storyline that simplifies the story. The movie also plays up the use of computerized special effects. The most astounding part of the movie was the ending, which could provoke unintended laughter. The idea of a Roman and Jew reconciling after they spent the entire movie maneuvering to kill each other was contrived and bordered on the ludicrous. I actually felt sorry for Messala. Indeed, as the movie shows he had cause to hate Judah. Judah wants revenge; instead he embraces the man who virtually destroyed Judah's enire family. While, I believe that putting aside enmity is a noble choice, that does not mean that one now must love one's former enemy. It is enough just to stop fighting, co-exist and let life go on."
" Good cinematography, unbelievable script
",0.5719,0.9173,2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,"A few filming bloopers (torches burning in bravado daylight, stirrups on horses before they were adopted by Rome or Judaea), but the cinematography was fairly good, and the acting was not bad, however, the script was not believable.
An unlikely series of events leads to a professional gambler putting up an unbelievable wager (3-1 odds using what was likely all his money) with the Roman governor, in an event that would undoubtedly be fixed in favor of the Romans, and with a charioteer who had no experience.
Then in the finale, despite all that happened and all the people killed, everybody forgives everyone and they all go back to living as one big, happy family."
" I couldn't believe how bad this movie is.
",0.431,-0.1263,2019-11-23 00:00:00,1,Watching on TV I thought this will be a good escape to watch a remake of a great movie with many memorable lines. I kept thinking I'm going to switch this off but stayed with even after I thought it was so bad. Morgan Freeman did pretty good. I don't know how good the others were but I didn't like them so I was rooting they all would lose. The ending was beyond belief. The boat scenes were okay. I watch a lot of bad movies but this one even shocked me.
" Not THAT bad!
",0.484,-0.1027,2019-11-19 00:00:00,5,"Has to be watched as a stand alone movie and not be compared previous versions. Truth be told everything is mediocre about the entire film, and the ending literally had me groaning.

Actors were wooden and unconvincing and exactly why many of them spoke in weird voices I have no idea. The actor portraying Jesus was badly cast and made him appear weak and ordinary. Just about every actor was poor but it was the movie itself that failed, the direction and script and production were all so bad.
I have tried to find something good to say about this movie but cannot!"

" A Hollywood catastrophe of a blockbuster

Even more makeup, cleanliness and Hollywood clichès than the blockbuster from 1959. Hollywood has learned nothing in almost 60 years if not to make movies even more plastic and unnatural. Shameful!"
" A pale remake of the great Magnum Opus
",0.6249,0.8832,2019-08-22 00:00:00,6,"Ben-Hur is an Epic Historical period drama movie directed by Timur Bekmambetov and starring Jack Huston, Toby Kebbell, Morgan Freeman, Nazanin Boniadi and Rodrigo Santoro.This is the fifth movie on the 1880 Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ.The movie is a very pale remake of the movie with the same name but has some good moments in its own.It seems that the director was in a hurry to make a movie as the opus seems to be a mini series. Huston doesn't looks impressive in the role of Judah Ben-Hur so as Toby kebbell.Morgan Freeman was impressive but hadn't much to do.The Chariot racing excites but hasn't enough to evoke the 1959 classic. The movie lacks passion and grandeur.Overall this is a pale attempt to recreate a classic"
" Don't trust the negative reviews

If you compare any modern day remake with its classic predecessor, you will never side with the remake. So don't do that. Instead, watch the beautifully written version is good actors. At first, after watching the trailer, I had 0 expectations. But then, it proved me wrong. So don't hold back and skip the movie, it is still as good as the classic."

Jack Huston is perfect as Judah. You can tell he's from Hollywood royalty by his bearing. Much better than CH. Chariot race was spectacular. The religious scenes were a little lacking, especially compared to Wyler's treatment. No one can really do Jesus justice. I mean, He is God. So, IMDB, please discard the 10 star rating or else don't let there be a grade below a 6. This is now on you!!!!"

But the more I saw, the more I liked the film. I was touched by their love turned hatred in such a short time. I was touched by all the pain that went through. I was touched by their interactivity. And when I finished watching the film, I was delighted that I went to see it. I tell all my friends to buy the DVD, because there are unusual surprises, but for me they were good. I might be the only one giving this film a 10, but for me it really deserved it, and I watch it quite often actually."

",-0.35,0.9497,2019-06-17 00:00:00,6,"Of course it doesn't compare to the original but it has its own special and unique way of telling the story- especially the more Christian focused take, which pays homage to the book and it's roots. This reason alone is why it garners so many bad reviews because, honestly, it's solid all around: acting, score, landscape, directing, are all well done. Jack Huston shines in a worthy performance that lives up to charlton Heston's legendary take on the character. All in all, it doesn't deserve the hate it gets, and it's gotten a lot."

This is what I can say for this version:
Sets: Amazing.
Costumes: Amazing
CGI: Amazing
That naval battle and the scenes in the galley: Amazing
The circus scenes: Amazing
Acting: Decidedly average across the board. Judah's voice irritatingly gruff - clear your throat, dude. Messala's unconvincing, and I usually like him as an actor.
The characterisation of the Romans as the only heartless ancient race who had slaves, killed their enemies, were bent on suppressing other religions and so on: really freakin old, and not remotely accurate.
Plot: Enjoyed it, right up until the final chariot race. Then that hokey happy ending. Worst ending ever. Like ever, ever in the history storytelling. Equivalent to a comet coming down and wiping out the whole world 'the end'."

" Modern and spectacular version about the known hero being sent into slavery , set in the Roman empire at the time of Christ .
",-0.296,0.9985,2019-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Nice rendition about Ben Hur , the Jew noble being sent into slavery by a Roman friend , then he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge ; including intense drama, marvelously staged battle ships and overwhelming chariot races . In A.D. 26-Jerusalem, the wealthy merchant and son of a Jewish family, Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston , John Huston's son) , enjoys a comfortable life along with his adopted brother Messala (Tony Kebbell) . However, Messala flees to Rome and it will lead to an eventual separation .Now a Roman tribune, Messala goes back ; childhood friends and brothers, Judah Ben-Hur and Messala meet once again but things go wrong . Nowadays , as experienced adults , this time Messala is a Roman officer , a tough conqueror against the Jews and Judah as a rich noble , though conquered , Israelite . An unexpected reunion takes place after many years with his childhood best friend , but Ben Hur soon finds, however, that his friend has changed and has become an arrogant conqueror, full of the grandeur of Rome , and it leads to fateful consequences , as Judah refuses to divulge the names of Jews who oppose Roman rule, and Messala decides to make an example of him , banishing Judah to a life of slavery and imprisonment at a galley ship. When in Jerusalem happens a Roman parade , where is wounded the ruthless governor Pontius Pilate (Pilou Asbæk ) Judah to be sent off as a galley slave , his ownership confiscated and his mother (Ayelet Zurer) and sister Tirzah (Sofia Black-D'Elia) imprisoned at an impregnable jail . But the brave Ben Hur goes on his determination to stay alive when his galleon is attacked by a Greek ship , and then , to be shipwrecked , as he becomes a castaway and escapes . Later on , Judah goes backs his homeland . Unable to locate his mummy and sister, and believing them dead , he can think of nothing else than vendetta against Messala . Judah'll finally find peace in this revolutionary and enlightened new doctrine of kindness : Christianity .Last movie of the acclaimed novel , being lavishly produced , stars Jack Huston and Tony Kebbell as Messala . This breathtaking film concerns about a merciless vengeance , not about forgiveness, only an unforeseen and gracious act of pardon will set free the once noble prince, who is now bent on revenge, as the incendiary teachings of the Nazarene Jesus rapidly gain ground. Although I think that the the famous novel written by Lewis Wallace is mainly about forgiveness . Furthermore , it deals with a extreme rivalry between the Roman Empire and Israel , in Rome the most important values were pride, rivalry, power, strength, the dictatorship of power , while in Israel rules the religion , rebelliousness , and protests against the Roman invader . Main cast is pretty good . Jack Huston is fine in the known role as wealthy Palestinan battling the Roman Empire who finally meets his rival in a justly famous chariot race and while rescuing his suffering family. And decent acting by Tony Kebbell as the nasty Messala who sends Judah to the galleys and throws his mother and sister into prison. Support cast is frankly well , such as : Ayelet Zuret , Sofia Black , Pilou Asbæk , James Cosmo , and mention special for Morgan Freeman who does some narrating in the beginning and end of the film. The chariot race required thousands of extras on sets constructed on lots of acres of lands . The MGM production costs were massive millions of dollars , as a lot of chariots were built , with half being used for practice . The race took various weeks to film ; both , director and producer insisted that the chariot circus be built for actual, and be made with as little computer graphics imagery as possible. They felt it was absolutely necessary, to make the chariot race look and feel realistic . The known chariot scene was shot at what is now the Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, and Matera, Basilicata, Gravina di Puglia, Bari, Apulia, Italy and other scenes in Painted Canyons, Mecca Hills, California, USA . Attractive images , majestic set design , glamorous photography in brilliant color by Oliver Wood , and evocative as well as rousing musical score by Marco Beltrani , all of them combine to cast a spellbinding movie , though inferior than other versions . The motion picture was professionally made by Director Timur Bekmambetov , though with no originality , being a real flop at the box office .Other retellings based on this vintage novel written by Lewis Wallace are the followings : Silent version by Fred Niblo with Ramon Novarro , Francis X Bushman , that still stands as the all-time silent classic ; it packs impressive scenes that still look nice , in spite of age and in 1931 , a shortened version was released .The classic version ¨Ben-Hur¨ won a record 11 Oscars , this recounting of the story is 87 minutes longer than the 2016 version , directed by William Wyler with Charlton Heston , Stephen Boyd , Haya Harareet , Jack Hawkins , Sam Jaffe , Finlay Currie , Martha Scott , Cathy O'Donnell , in which stuntman Cliff Lyons worked a Stuntman/chariot driver in both versions : 1925 and 1959 ; it ranked as the most expensive movie of its time and took years to end ; it is one of the greatest films in the genre ""Epic"". Ben-Hur still stands as the all-time silent classic . And cartoon version (2003) by Bill Kowalchuck with prologue by Charlton Heston and ¨Ben-Hur¨ TV series by Steven Shrill with Joseph Morgan , Stephen Campbell Moore , Kristen Krouk , Simon Andreu and Lucia Jimenez"

" Falls way short of the 59 epic.
",0.0,-0.6236,2018-12-16 00:00:00,7,"I really wanted to love this film but compared to the 1959 extravaganza it's a massive letdown. For a start the Heston version is way over 200 minutes long, which is unacceptable in today's multiplexes (and also way to costly). So in the re-boot we are left with a severely truncated version, which jumps to quickly to the action sequences. Unlike true (modern) epics such as 'Gladiator', or 'The Passion of Christ', there is little risk taking and found the lead actor a bit weak, especially when comparing to the 'ripped' Charlton.H. To its credit some scenes were very good (especially the sea battle) and with the excellent English actor Toby Kebbell in the part of the Roman Brother. Also to make it a bit more up to date and realistic, the evil Romans are not in fact so evil, just in an uncompromising situation."
" Not worth it
",-0.1695,0.1639,2018-12-15 00:00:00,4,"A very bad and disappointing remake of the great, amazing, and unique movie of Ben Hur."
" BORING!
",-0.3802,-0.5434,2018-11-17 00:00:00,1,This move was VERY slow and plodding. The religious aspects seemed to be added for no particular reason (adding nothing at all to the supposed plot) and the ending was stupid and completely unbelievable.
" The script deserved a better editor and production values...
",0.4404,0.9926,2018-11-14 00:00:00,8,"I love the story of Ben-Hur. I have seen pretty much every version and the 59' Wyler telling is one of my favorite films. Even so I was so sure there was really no point remaking the film again for the 5th or so time. There wasn't much to do with the story that hadn't been done before. Fortunately, I was wrong. This script makes some radical departures from the book/other versions that make it very worthwhile to see if you like the story. The Rome section is lifted entirety, Ilderim's role is expanded (including some basic tactics for the race being explained) and he is more a mentor, and most of all Messala is far more sympathetic character in this telling. In the various telling of the story it was always a bit lopsided in that Judah was seeking revenge and had to learn to turn the other cheek. Because of how the first act is re-worked both Judah and Messala end up as betrayers and betrayed. So both of them have to learn the turn the other cheek and both have to work at forgiveness. It makes the central conflict a little more grey, more human. The religious themes ended up being a lot more overtly Christian then I expected here due to this. I think this version is more pointedly about Jesus the Christ than the 59' version. Overall the script does a lot of very interesting things in how it composed the story. For once the chariot race and imagery is completely central to the film.The acting is generally good. Huston, for once, makes Judah look Jewish and he makes a good emotional center. Kebbell is not Boyd, but few are; His Messala is brutish but lovable solider (jock) that acts a good foil for Judah. The final scene is a touch unearned nonetheless it works because of Kebbell. Freeman has always done mentor characters well and he is no exception here.Unfortunately, the film is significantly marred by lackluster technical aspects. The CGI work on the whole is serviceable but there are multiple critical animations that don't work. The film does not quite have the grand scope required in its art direction. I am also pretty sure in one scene the characters are wearing denim which is just terrible. Worst of all the editing scheme is rather choppy. A lot of this is too shrink the story down to 2 hours and so a lot of jump cuts push the narrative forward. It sometimes really works-this may be the best of all the Great Sea Battles as a result-yet on the whole it is distracting and makes the film very jerky to watch.I wished this did better with the critics and at the box office. It is a good film. Certainly better than most Marvel films."

" How can Ben-Hur be too low key?
",-0.2732,0.9847,2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Rich Jew Judah Ben-Hur is sent to the galleys by Messala, his youthful best friend, because of an attack from his roof during a Roman parade. Escaping after 5 years as a galley slave he seeks to take revenge on Messala by beating him in a chariot race. After the race, the blood from Jesus' crucifixion cures Judah's mother and sister of leprosy and takes the hate from Judah's heart.The danger of a remake is pitching the new film in a place where it is different enough so that it isn't pointless, but captures enough of what made the original work. And the original, here (if one ignores other versions), was a multi-Oscar winning, sprawling Biblical epic. So what Timur (Wanted) Bekmambetov has done here is capture the main story beats, but changed almost everything else.The almost homoerotic jealousy which drove the relationship between Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd in Wyler's epic is, here, replaced by a most unexpected fraternal bromance in which the driving force appears to be Messala's wish to impress Judah's mother (I am deliberately not spoilering a plot element here). This lengthy opening sequence, albeit seasoned with a couple of flash-forwards, gives the story-teling a completely different rhythm to the 1959 version.Visually, there is some good stuff, with production value well on display. Locations, particularly the location which substitutes for Jerusalem, are mostly spectacular (with the exception of the early, rather jarring, appearance of the overly-familiar Vasquez Rocks), the chariot race is well-staged, and the CGI sea battle is more convincing than Heston's toy boats (although, curiously, far less exciting).But there are two areas where the film falls down. One is the script which is, at best, functional, but often rather feeble. And the other is that, with the exception of Rodrigo Santoro's Jesus and Nazanin Boniadi's Esther, none of the performers offer anything beyond photogenic competence. There is nothing to match Heston's sheer presence or Boyd's passionate malice. This film is in an altogether lower key. Even Morgan Freeman's usual gravitas is undermined by his out-of-place American accent.I enjoyed this, especially because it gave me much which I did not expect. But it is not an epic."
" Utterly superfluous remake
",0.0,0.9169,2018-03-06 00:00:00,1,"Actually, apart from the sea battle viewed on YouTube, I haven't even seen this movie, so why am I reviewing it? Well, I'm not--I just want to make a point here. The '59 version is my all-time favorite film, a re-make of the '25 version. MGM made a wise decision to remake that earlier version because so much had changed, not least color, sound and widescreen. Those 3 things along would have justified a remake, let alone the opportunities for injecting real human drama into what had been a bit of a puppet show. So what is the justification for this latest version? I ask. Wide screen is no wider (in fact it's smaller, since the '59 version was filmed in what would later be called Super Panavision). Color is still color and nothing more. Ditto sound. So what did these filmmakers hope to achieve. Richer drama? Unlikely. Better acting? Even more unlikely. More exciting action? Yes, there's scope for improving the sea battle, previously done with model ships, but having seen the new sea battle I can attest that it's far less exciting than the old, which just goes to prove that CGI has its limitations (but you already knew that). So again, what was the justification? Wobbly camera? Faster editing for the short attention span crowd? The only thing I can think of is that it's a tax write-off, like in The Producers. I mean, why else hire the director of ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter""? You would only do that if you were looking for a failure. right? Right! So now we know. Case closed. Now, will someone please sue MGM for cruelty to cinema audiences."
" My review to Ben Hur (2016)
",0.0,-0.9989,2018-03-01 00:00:00,1,"I'm very tired of Hollywood's lack of ideas. Many of you have already read at least half a dozen negative reviews towards this remake, but I will make the effort to dedicate more time of my life to such nonsense. I've been since this project was announced being a type of character that I usually criticize, one of those ""haters"" who hate something before seeing it. But I think I have based my baseless hatred on substantiated elements. I proceed to explain myself. Well, the writers weren't bad, much less. There's John Ridley (""12 Years of Slave"") that I have no idea what he's done this time because the script is infamous; and Keith R. Clarke (""The Way Back""). Nor did I reject the election of Marco Beltrami as composer, occupying the post of Miklós Rózsa. Needless to say, the work of Beltrami is a joke if someone tries to compare it with the wonderful composition of Rózsa for the film by William Wyler. But there were two sections that seemed like a joke in bad taste. First the cast. I don't know what can make you hire Morgan Freeman, dread him, and make him look like an aged Bob Marley; of course I don't accept that Jack Huston (even knowing that he is a very competent actor) is the substitute for the extraordinary interpretation of Charlton Heston and the third in discord; perhaps the role that almost six decades ago Stephen Boyd interpreted was now for Toby Kebbel, was the least bad of the three decisions. But coincidentally Kebbel is worse than ever. And if I don't accept these casting decisions, much less accept that the baton has the lousy Timur Bekmambetov (""Day Watch"", ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter""). A decision that I don't understand either because I've been thinking about it for a year. If you want to take to the halls the more than unnecessary remake of one of the best films that the seventh art has given and that after 57 years of its premiere, it has still not aged in the least, at least do it with seriousness and quality. But no, Paramount has wanted to help make the 2016 summer the worst in a long time and I'm going to explain to you because ""Ben-Hur"" is one of those few special films, capable of receiving a zero note.
To begin with, the planning and construction of the film career scene of the '59 film took more time than the whole process of this remake, it is an absolute declaration of intentions. But let's go into present matter. It is very easy to explain why I have given a zero to this film, although I face these lines with some fear of not making it clear enough. Beyond that there is nothing new in this movie, the problem is that there is nothing good in it; nothing that deserves to be seen or heard. It is a harmful product, which represents all the bad things that cinema can offer and goes against the possibility that it can be called art. The script changes meaningless things by becoming more flimsy and stupid with each decision (what happened to the plot of Arius?), adds unnecessary scenes and corrupts some fundamentals (the appearance of Jesus Christ, the galleys, the bet, the romantic subplot, the encounter with the family, the crucifixion, and thus hundreds). There are scenes and complete lines of dialogue that seem part of the false shots, as well as characters that are a one-dimensional, incongruous and impossible to understand disaster in which only Messala seems to be better at the initial moments, to immediately take a radical turn and inhuman that the whole movie remains until another pathetic turn at the end. In the '59 version, Messala, fatally injured, says in a triumphant tone before dying, that ""the race is not over"", to a puzzled Judah. In the 2016 version, we have instead, Judah and Messala forgiving each other tearfully, ending with both riding into the sunset, as if it were a Western B-movie.
The truth is that Rodrigo Santoro and Jack Huston strive to build their characters, but the race was lost before it started.Then there is Bekmambetov's acts, which could and should be studied in schools as a paradigmatic example of a work totally lacking in visual style. His film is ugly, his camera tricks cause his eyes to bleed, there are constant breaks in continuity and the CGI sings twice as much as the tricks used in the movie of '59. Neither can he direct the actors or create a visual narration , nor deepen the drama between the characters, nor represent the religious component. The latter is in fact very funny, first because the dialogues of Jesus and the bride of Judah are as insubstantial as they are repetitive. Second, because there are flawed failures in all that ""subplot"" and especially in the new attempt to portray Ben-Hur as a contemporary of Jesus. It seems that the film lives from its incongruities, its shortcomings and its lamentable visual vices. Still, what hurts me the most isn't seeing how bad the cast acts, listening to the infernal dialogues, seeing how empty the content and ideas the film is, suffering trying to make sense of that pulseless recording in the middle of a horrible photograph, the digital zooms even in details, that each use of GoPros is like suffering a whiplash or that far above epic or dramatic is laughable; the worst thing is that each scene automatically takes you to the respective scene of the film of '59 and having to witness how they destroy it with a clean machete. Everything as an excuse to finish arriving at the chariot race (for something the movie starts with her). A tedious, frightening scene, much uglier and outdated than one of 57 years ago; and that within the set improves slightly because the film still has to deliver the worst of all its excessive footage. The final scenes and that message of redemption so trampled that one chokes, there is the worst of this hateful production that has almost completely destroyed my hopes in the seventh art.
""Ben-Hur"" is everything I imagined and something else. It is a perfect representation of how cinema has gone from more to less in many aspects. Bekmambetov takes a classic, opens the channel and takes out all the entrails in front of the viewer. There is nothing to save from a movie that had all the losing before you start running and also went to the race with materials of the worst quality possible. Competing in a digital circus, with sick horses, a papier-mâché quadriga and a one-armed, blind, deaf and drunk pilot; ""Ben-Hur"" (2016) is condemned to a well-deserved slow death, not because of defeat, but because of the lamentable spectacle that has caused us to suffer. When will Hollywood learn that masterpieces shouldn't be sullied?P.D.: I'm ashamed for the reviewers that defend this version with such senseless arguments like saying that Billy Wilder's Ben Hur wasn't so good (maybe some have never seen it) or that they left the cinema amused. I would like to know the real age of those who defends this film. What a disaster of a movie and how stupid to defend the indefensible."

This film's fine enough as a stand-alone production but it pales in comparison to the original movie. For a modern film it's pretty decent, with plenty of historical accuracy and some nice actors chosen for the main parts. I enjoyed it well enough, at least until that ruinous pop song comes on just before the end credits, and even the religious aspect is handled quite sensitively. Jack Huston is a likeable lead who undergoes a huge character arc, and Toby Kebbell brings passion and depth to what could have been a stock bad guy role. The story flags at times but is generally lifted by solid action, sometimes featuring pretty poor CGI effects. The climactic chariot race is nowhere near as good as the original's, but I was surprised that it's still very good, especially so given that Russian director Timur Bekmambetov has previously made some very bad films indeed."

I think you'll need to know a bit about the politics in the time of Jesus Christ to totally get what is going on (but hey, there's not a single movie in which you don't need to know something about life to understand). Why do I love this movie? Well, for one, I'm a HUGE horses fan, and there are some lethally beautiful equines in this film. Ja, I'm half- serious here because a chariot gets wrecked and the horses are crashing through the tents and all that jazz. Secondly, I love how Jesus isn't the main feature (read: doesn't get all the screen time) but it shows how his actions and message impact people on multiple levels, even indirectly. You see him dip in and out of the story line.I also really love the tension between the brothers in terms of beliefs, station, choices, and paths of life. The characters are conflicted over family, love/romantic partner, politics, government, and duty.The character portrayal wasn't 100%, but it was fun to watch Morgan Freeman feature in this film (as a rich merchant or chariot race- betting person) who definitely delivers. There's a lot of drama (so not low-key) especially between the two brothers and the set for this movie was Really nice. Note the capital R. The armor looked hand-crafted and the cloaks they wear are top-notch... not that I'm a cloak expert or anything but you catch my drift!Overall, an excellent movie with reconciliation and forgiveness being offered at the last bit.

" The only epic thing about this is how disastrously a lot of it is executed
",0.0,-0.9942,2017-11-23 00:00:00,3,"To me, and quite a number of others, the definitive 'Ben-Hur' version (also the best known) will always be the one from 1959 starring Charlton Heston and directed by William Wyler, a film that epitomises the term epic in every sense and in many ways iconic. A very strong case can also be made for the 1925 silent version, a huge achievement in its day and awe-inspiring in its spectacle.Unfortunately, this cannot be said for this 2016 version of 'Ben-Hur', nowhere near in the same league as the other two, pretty much insulting to them and the source material, and a mess of a film in its own right. Judging it as a film on its own, a lot of it is disastrously executed and a few good things only just about salvages it from being bottom of the barrel. It's not one of the worst remakes like 'Psycho', 'The Wicker Man', 'Rollerball', 'Ghostbusters' and 'Stepford Wives' to name examples, but to me it's down there with the most pointless and one where one questions ""what was the need"".Its least bad assets are some nice scenery, the sea battle scene that delivers on the tension and excitement that is severely lacking elsewhere and Jack Huston. Huston may not be as imposing or as charismatic as Heston especially, but he cuts a dashing figure and brings a quiet dignity to the title role and at least tries to give some likability. Elsewhere, 'Ben-Hur' is a failure.Visually, only the scenery is halfway decent. It is however wasted by the film constantly being shot in a far too dark and murky way, chaotic cinematography and editing that looks as though it was done on a on-its-last-legs bacon slicer. The CGI is excessive, feels shoe-horned in and gives even more of an inept video game look. Even the costumes look cheap and very anachronistic to boot.Sea battle apart, the action is undone by clumsy and chaotic choreography/staging, director Timur Bermambetov (directing throughout in a lifeless fashion, highly suggestive that he was not right for the material and clearly had badly misinterpreted it) taking it too far with the brashness and grit and by such a cheap visual look. The chariot race, brilliantly done in the 1925 film and iconic in the 1959 one, is too murkily shot, too choppily edited and too brash to be remotely exciting.Was not expecting music on the same level as one of a kind Miklos Rozsa, but this aspect was not only uninspired and forgettable it completely jars with the period and like Marco Beltrami had forgotten what kind of film he was scoring for. It's not the only thing that fails to gel. Failing even more are the forced and heavy-handed religious and cultural elements and especially one of 2016's most cringe-worthy, embarrassingly out of place and pointless scenes in Jesus' epilogue.'Ben-Hur' is very poorly written, with lots of melodrama and awkwardness and no heart or intrigue. The story really struggles to find its own identity and brings forth few ideas of its own. The famous scenes incorporated are completely diminished generally in impact, thanks to the visual ineptitude, being far too brash and breakneck in pace and the over-emphasis on the gritty tone. There is nothing epic here, instead one isn't ever entirely sure whether to consider it a completely soulless biblical drama or a completely humourless parody of 'Life of Brian'.Regarding the cast, near-uniformly poor. Excepting Huston, who still isn't particularly great. Toby Kebbell fails to bring much threat or complexity to Messala, who is more stock than menacing or conflicted. The scenes between him and Huston are too soap-operatic to be believable. Simonides and Quintas are so mishandled in screen time (under-utilised) and development (one-dimensional) that the point of them being there is questioned. Faring worst are Rodrigo Santoro, trying too hard as Jesus in an interpretation so bizarre and out of kilter it was like he accidentally wandered into the wrong film, and the normally dependable Morgan Freeman looking like he wasn't even trying.Overall, a mess with a lot of elements executed disastrously. There is definitely far worse out there but this was near-incompetent stuff with a few small salvageable elements. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

Many say there was no need to recreate the massive 3.5hr famous epic 1959 version with Heston. Hollywood felt otherwise and peppered this movie with money and marketing resources yet didn't focus enough on a crisp story. I don't recall much from the 1959 version but this felt too glossy and the historical chariot race was modernly jarring and frantic; mildly entertaining while lacking character. I'm not sure if the scenes with Jesus were better worked into the 1959 story to highlight his importance but here he was sporadically mentioned and then they bolted on his respectfully produced and told crucifixion scene. The inclusion, flow and pacing of that final scene was unexpected. One darkly amusing part was with a loyal battleship drummer who was determined to keep the beat for the rowers despite being set on fire by a flame arrow."

Fast forward a few generations and we have 2016's adaptation of the brother vs. brother battle royale. ""Spoiler"" alert - one pales in comparison to the other.Even without comparing the two, the Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell-starring film is a disappointment, as it tries to be an epic action-adventure but comes off feeling like a messy compilation of dramatic family scuffles, Roman war battles (on land and sea) and some chariot racing to boot. We see how two adopted brothers who are princes in Jerusalem grow apart after a false accusation is made against one (Huston, as Judah), resulting in his banishment and of course inevitable return to seek revenge against the other (Kebbell, as Messala).Since this is a remake of an older, celebrated film, plot originality is not at play here - everything comes down to execution. In this respect, you can tell MGM and the production team sank a lot of budget into the special effects, the set and the sound. Aside from the two frontmen, most of the rest of the supporting cast are relatively unknown, from Nazanin Boniadi (who plays Judah's wife) to Rodrigo Santoro (Jesus of Nazareth) and Pilou Asbæk (Pontius Pilate) - fresh off his role as Euron Greyjoy in 'Game of Thrones.' And then, no biblical times saga would be complete without an appearance from Morgan Freeman.While it was a valiant effort to try to shave off the long runtime of the original film, what happened here is things instead feel extremely condensed and forced. Portions of 'Ben-Hur' easily could have been left out in order to allow for a streamlined, ""clean"" product, but instead audiences are left confused as to what the story really is about.'Ben-Hur' is a warning sign to Hollywood that not all cinematic classics should be 21st Century- ized in an attempt to make a quick buck."

They humanized the character.The film is introduced by Morgan Freeman who later turns up as the desert trader Ilderim. Toby Kebbell plays Messala Severus, a complex protagonist/antagonist character, the adopted Roman brother of Judea Ben-Hur.

Judah isn't all that sympathetic and Messala isn't all that bad. Their motivations don't support their actions. Indeed, after everything, it turns out that Messala doesn't die, the characters drop their antagonism for no apparent reason, and everyone lives happily ever after. Ugh! Add to that a plodding pace that doesn't build at all, a chariot race filled with so many cuts and close-ups that you never really are convinced it is real, with characters who bounce back from impossible physical conditions with super- hero like ability with hardly a scratch...it becomes a yawner.Re-making one of the all-time classics is fraught with peril.

Don't know why Russian Director Timur Bekmambetov didn't pick up on this to add strength to his somewhat by-the-numbers performance. Some actors perhaps can stay too long in the workforce and lose a degree of feeling for their art. The Christ story features more in this version (I assume to cash in on some recent successful Biblical productions) and adds strength to the overall story. There's some messy hand help camera work (noticeably worse in some of the claustrophobic earlier scenes) as well as too much unnecessary over exaggeration of certain situations during the famed Chariot race that largely detracts. The ships galley-slaves sequence is still quite terrifyingly atmospheric. Award winning screenplay writer John Ridley seems to have done a reasonable job of reducing the running time from the overlong (while still good) 1959 version and although there are many compromises - those who have not seen the other will probably not be aware. Composers Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts deliver a rather thunderous, exciting action score. Interesting for its strong message but overly simplified to be another classic. Worth a look without overly high expectations."
" A solid movie
",0.1531,0.8934,2017-06-24 00:00:00,9,"To be honest my thoughts were this movie would be a rape of Chuck Heston, I'm 58 years old. This movie was a genuine thoughtful remake of a timeless classic, no competition with the old, a new version of a timeless classic. Timur Bekmambetov had a very rare idea ""something original"" For Hollywood anyway, he made his thoughts and vision come through. I liked this movie, even with Freeman that pinko bastard being in it to pull some viewers in. The ending was a bit much with the cheering , I expected to see some guy's trying to get a wave going. Other than that a great effort."
" Very bad remake.
",-0.5849,-0.3387,2017-06-12 00:00:00,1,"Compared with the 1925 version with Ramon Novarro, which I think is the best, and the 1959 version with Charlton Heston which is a close second, this version is absolutely the pits. It stinks! There are places where this movie does not follow the book, for example, when the ship that Judah is on is sunk in the battle on the Ionian sea, he doesn't rescue the Roman in charge, thus is not adopted by him, and doesn't become a Roman citizen. Even the chariot race isn't up to par with the two earlier versions."
" a remake that totally fails
",-0.4754,-0.9665,2017-06-12 00:00:00,1,"there is no depth of character development.no emotion and no sensible , coherent story. the dialog is largely paraphrased from various other sources and it is not fluid. the story as written in the book by Lew Wallace , is so distorted that it bears no trace of the original plot: that Ben Hur rescues a Roman Naval Commander, is adopted by him. and ends up a higher ranking Roman citizen than Mesalla. Thus elevated, Ben Hur returns to Jerusalem and brings destruction upon Mesalla using the chariot race as his weapon.The leprosy afflicting the sister and mother of Ben Hur, the torture of Esther's father, the life of Ben Hur as a wealthy Roman learning chariot skills ,and so much more [ Ben Hur is not married to Esther who remains a slave ,the zealot attack is inaccurate as in the book Tirza breaks a roof tile which falls] are omitted or sorely invented . this remake is a piece of fluff and has no merit.and has no emotional depth.the Charlton Heston version is a real work of art and there cannot be a remake to equal it, as there was no digital short-cutting , it was real."
" Another Awful Remake

A story of the Christ. lock all Hollywood remakes it's horrible Hollywood can't come up with an original thought or idea anymore and it's even worse when they dragged out all of our old movies that are epics and also they begin trying to write biblical stories without God and Christ involved. I love movies but for the past 10-15 years I would guess 50% of movies are re-makes or comic book/superhero.it would be a miracle if Holkywoid would get any original, creative ideas and make original movies. Hollywood also m eeds to sit back and watch the best movies of the past 50-60 years and learn to make real dramas and stories wirh meat on the bones that ate believable."

There were whole chunks of the original story missing, chunks that made sense, and added to the story.The narration at the beginning first alerted me.

I heard that Tom Hiddelston turned it down and good for him, any actor should think twice about doing a role already done by Charleston Heston. The thing that struck me most is how they downplayed the beauty of the scenes of Jesus, they never showed his face and he rarely appeared but, nevertheless, he was a great presence, from the first time he appeared just as gentle hands brushing away Judah's thirst. The actor who played Jesus seemed to me more fit to play a drunk in a bar, how they chose him completely mystifies me. The actor who played Judah really tried hard, but Messala was a mess, and I don't think Morgan Freeman was even trying to act. What a colossal waste of time."

" Epic in action and emotion - and yes, it's even BETTER than the original!
",0.837,0.9971,2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"To be honest, after the crappy disasters of supposedly Christian movies meant to be directly based on the Bible that's Russell Crowe's weird ""Noah"" and Christian Bale's pathetic ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"", I almost gave up all hope of these un-Christian movies in Christian movie clothing, full of unashamed inauthenticity. So I decided to watch a movie that is NOT directly based on the Bible, Jack Huston's ""Ben Hur"", and it turned out to be more Christian than Noah or Exodus combined - all in a pretty epic movie!Given this is based on the book and being the 2nd movie made with the same name, the plot is no surprise. At high level, it's a story of 2 brothers who went their separate ways due to a misunderstanding and betrayal, where hate drove them closer and closer to killing each other, but in the end found that forgiveness was more powerful than vengeance. Now that would make a boring story if it wasn't for strong acting and scripting, and of course, the epic action scenes (the ship / galley and horse racing scenes in particular) which were done with absolute purpose, woven into the very story itself. Where's the Christian part of it? Well, Ben-Hur lives in the same period as Jesus Christ and so we find Ben-Hur and his family occasionally experiencing Jesus' wisdom and love. Of course, Jesus' narrative is only the backdrop and he only makes a couple of appearances. (this is not a Jesus film - for that, try Passion of the Christ!).Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell held strong chemistry as brothers in the movie - going from close brotherhood to distant enemies and reconciled as brothers again. Jack Huston proves to be a versatile actor, exuding joviality, confidence, hatred, joy, tenderness - expressing the right emotions at the right times. Morgan Freeman plays Ilderim, a good supporting role in helping Ben-Hur face his brother in the final showdown.This is one movie I would happily watch with the family. The values are wholesome, the action is epic, the movie is simply beautiful. Well worth the watch. One of the best movies I watched so far. And yes, of course it's better than the original - this is made in 2016 with better technology supporting the actors!"
" Loses to it's 1959 predecessor
",-0.3182,0.8611,2017-04-24 00:00:00,1,"Ben Hur 2016 Where do I start? Leaving aside the standard washy post production special effects present on all movies these days,the plot ( yes most movies need one ) departs totally in places from Lew Wallace's book. While following the 1959 epic was no doubt a daunting prospect, it appears that this version was aimed at viewers with a very short span of attention as well as poor memory retention, if the frequent corny flashbacks are anything to go by. The mighty Balthasar is dropped from the story, Simonides ( Esther's father ) hovers pointlessly in the background and most astonishingly, the pivotal character of Quintus Arrius is reduced to a one dimensional brute as in fact are all of the Roman characters, and he is quickly dispatched by Judah with his oar during the chariot race along with the entire back story of Judah and Arrius's father son relationship in Rome which was essential to the tale. Consequently his time in Rome learning to be a charioteer is gone too. This is left to a dread locked Morgan Freeman in the Ilderim role, shouting out instructions to him during the chariot race, ( I kid you not ). This pairing down of Lew Wallace's characters seriously mars the story and I'm sorry but no long beard and hair was going to convince me that Judah had spent five years chained to an oar living off his thirst for revenge. To be fair Timur Bekmambetov had a hard act to follow in William Wyler. But what is missing from this version is depth. From Lew Wallace during the American civil war, to almost the entire cast and crew of the 1959 version ( Wyler and Heston in particular ) many experienced the horrors of war and death first hand and it shows in their work. As maligned as Charlton Heston has been these past years, unfairly in my opinion, his performance as the tortured Judah hell bent on revenge is a truly unforgettable performance, in a film which is a masterpiece of cinema with an outstanding script of emotional depth by Gore Vidal that sets it apart and above all the other turgid biblical epics of that time. Long .. yes, religious ..somewhat, but Ben Hur is a tale about the road from hate and revenge to forgiveness and redemption that the 1959 version admirably succeeded in conveying. Even the over the top melodramatic ending of Wylers 1959 film ( angel choirs included ) doesn't mar the impact of the stunning crucifixion. The Calvary scene in the 2016 version I'm sad to say would be almost as funny as Monty Python's depiction, if it weren't trying to be serious. Christ's exit in Ben Hur 2016 is as under whelming as was his entrance. This is then topped off by a post chariot race Messala hopping game-fully along on one leg with the Hur family, all friends again. In the Heston version, Messala played by Irish actor Stephen Boyd spits his last words of dying hate to Judah by informing his one time friend of the true fate of his mother and sister. Now that's hatred! The excellent actor Jack Huston who has yet to land a role as memorable as the WW1 veteran Richard Harrow in Boardwalk Empire, really deserved better. Along with his fellow actors in Ben Hur 2016 he cannot be blamed for this stinker of a film. They all gave it a good shot, and given a better script that adhered to the book, I believe they would have fared better."

It was different from the book in a lot of ways, but the original movie with Heston departed from the book in a lot of ways. I didn't like how they had Jesus saying things He most likely would never have said like ""love is our true nature."" In the book Jesus's words were basically all scriptural. His scenes would have been way more powerful had they stuck to using His actual words. I thought the ending with Mesalla and Judah was a nice twist. It would be nice to see a movie that stuck more to the book though."

I was very anxious to see how they would change it up to tell the same story but not make a carbon copy. I thought they did an OK job of inter- twining the story of Christ with the story of Ben-Hur. The Christ saga was much more prevalent in this version. One of the problems with this movie was the awkwardness of the Christ character every time he would give direct bible quotes even if it didn't completely apply to the situation. Jesus was just too overly sweet and it just seemed awkward. Second was dead pan emotionless Morgan Freeman in the most ridiculous wig ever. Just a waste. My third concern was that the hardship of the galley was in no way conveyed as effectively as in the 1959 version. Overall it was watchable and the two leads did a good job. I just think they took on an impossible task of trying to improve on one of the greatest movies ever made.

One of those epic movies that seem to be able to stand the test of time. Don't get me wrong, that movie also aged, but way more gracefully than many others. But back to this, with the very familiar story.While we don't have a Charlton Heston kind of actor in this (name wise and status wise), we have Morgan Freeman in a supporting role. And he sells one of the most pivotal dialog scenes in the movie. We also get a lot of Jesus of Nazareth in this (I kind of feel like a bit more than there was in the original). The effects and the visuals are almost impeccable. Though I'm not sure that will be enough for a lot of people to enjoy. I still don't get the character switch, but the actors involved do their best to convey their characters. It could've been worse ..."

" Boring-Hur
",0.0,0.9356,2017-04-02 00:00:00,4,"Have you ever been in a discussion with a bunch of movie fans about how much you'd all wish there'd be a remake of the beloved 1959 Oscar sweeping Charlton Heston epic Ben-Hur? A film that to this day stands the test of time as a ground-breaking and emotionally strong piece of grandiose filmmaking that today's CGI led spectacles can't match.I wouldn't be surprised if this conversation has never happened with you and your film buddies but it obviously happened one quite day around a Hollywood executives table where those in charge of the money coffers decided what the world needed was a reimagining of Ben-Hur.A reimagining that here shalt forever be known as Boring-Hur.Hiring the very random talents of Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch one minute, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter the next) to bring the epic story of the unfortunate Judah Ben-Hur to life once more, this update on the tale fails to capture the imagination or heart of the story that makes the tale of Hur such a beloved one.Scope is lost in this 2 hour event where we fail to connect with Jack Huston's titular hero while Bekmambetov seems too preoccupied with setting up 3-D moments in the film whilst forgoing any important elements like character development, decent dialogue or CGI improvements (some CGI in the film would be out of place in a video game) so Ben-Hur's chances of even walking the shadow of its forefather are shot before they even really begin.There's little nuance to anything that happens here and while the film is perhaps not the total train-wreck that many called it upon its dire release (where the film lost countless of millions for its struggling studio) there's nothing that saves this generic event from the doldrums.Jack Huston try's in his biggest role yet in a feature film but the talented performer wasn't a great pick for the lead role here and it's a shame his yet to match his recurring role as Richard Harrow in HBO's brilliant series Boardwalk Empire, while Bekmambetov does find some moments of genuine excitement in a few of the films set pieces like a battle on the high seas or the films over advertised chariot race (that still is beaten out by the 1959 version), but these moments are few and far between and often sandwiched between a dreadlocked Morgan Freeman and the continued downward spiral of Toby Kebbell's once bright looking career.An as to be expected pointless redoing of a story that deserves far better, Ben-Hur is a largely lifeless affair done in a way that sparks very little in the way of movie magic and while there were worse big budgeted films in 2016, Ben-Hur is certainly one of the most forgettable.2 pure white horses out of 5"

This 2016 remake pales in comparison, wasting $100 Million dollars, and with such a poor cast, it left me wondering what the hell they spent all the money on!?!

" Not a classic, but its flaws are forgivable
",0.5499,0.9925,2017-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Plot; A young Jewish prince seeks revenge against his adopted Roman brother after the latter betrays him and leaves him for dead.I've only ever seen the original once, and that was a bleary-eyed and impromptu Easter Sunday viewing many years ago. My recollections are vague other than the glorious chariot race scene, but I recall it being more impressive than compelling. This 21st century remake cuts the runtime of the original nearly in half, and while its relative brevity won the favor of my backside, it does leave little dramatic meat on its bones. Oh sure, the beats are all there, but this is more of a Cliff Notes version of the story.The film often looks and feels like a mid-tier mini-series or made-for-TV movie, thanks mostly to its often uninspired direction. It's a shame, too, because the production values are otherwise pretty impressive. The cast really do nothing to fatten up the thinned out material they're given, and the first hour or so plods along listlessly as if waiting for a spark. That spark arrives in the second half as title character sets out to get his revenge. The stage for this vengeance is the chariot race, and while this version is really no match for the original, it is an intense and white knuckle action sequence that scratches a particular itch.As in the original, this story of Judah Ben-Hur runs parallel with that of Jesus, and while I can see how the two are meant to mesh together (Judah's lust for vengeance turning into forgiveness), it doesn't always mesh as organically as you'd hope.This is no classic, but for the Twitter generation it may serve as a more palatable vessel for this story of faith and forgiveness."
" The Glory Has Departed.
",0.5423,0.5106,2017-03-24 00:00:00,4,"I think the problem with this movie begins with the change from a tile falling off the roof to a random zealot shooting an arrow. With this seemingly minor change come all the other changes that make this movie a shell of its former self found in the book.What is lost is the grandeur, the awe, and the providence of God that mysteriously moves Judah Ben-Hur towards his encounter with the Christ. In its place is a crazy zealot and Morgan Freeman giving advice on how to win a chariot race and how to live life.The original Ben-Hur was supposed to be a ""Tale About the Christ"". But it has become a morality play about the rivalry of two brothers and about a guy that changes from being angry to a guy that learns to forgive. No need for Christ here except a very liberal one that gives Judah Ben-Hur and us an example of being kind, compassionate, and forgiving. Frankly the story could have been told without Jesus.There is the cross but no reason for it except the cruelty of the Romans and Jesus saying that he is doing it out of his own free will. And there is no resurrection only the reference that the thief will today be in paradise. Is the thief the guy who shot the arrow?"
" A good representation of Roman games and family honour
",0.765,0.9889,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Good day all Movie fanatics. Well let us talk about this movie. Relax I will keep it short. we are talking about the 2016 edition. The movie had a mix in it Religion just the right amount not to offend any religion, the fight against army and navy and anyone who served in the Military knows who is he best. As I was Air Force, I go with the crowd. And of course the old, good guy wearing white and the bad guy wearing black. [ they did not have cowboy hats so they used colour coded amour] and that good can triumph against evil. The DVD that I purchased overseas, had the very low volume on talking parts, and, as Microsoft 10 does not support my legacy equipment I am using Kodi to run my LG super multi drive so that fixed that. I would check with someone that purchased the movie in N.A. to see if they have the same problem.The action was great, but if you are using 52 inch 4K make sure you have the correct distance as the race can be hard on the eyes if not. The naval battle parts were great and gave you a perspective of an slave on the ship that many movies of that time has not given. The race showed the horses dying but of course no animals were injured in the making of the movie but man, as you are caught up in the action you could believe it did happen. I loved the movie as they did not dwell on subject mater for too long in any one area but switched it up, but not to much like reading Game of Thrones. Also the movie although taking some liberties, stuck to the story, but did not try and capture the filming of the 1950's or when ever the original came out. So if you hated the new Ghost busters because of it trying to be a remake of the original, no worries.Morgan Freeman's part was done excellent as most of his movies are, but I wish there was a part that could have been added to give him a stronger role but there is nothing in the story that would allow it.So if like moves in Roman times, i think you will like this very much. Insert the DVD and enjoy ! and for those of you that are saying DVD ? yes I am old school if it works don't get rid of it.Good Viewing and thank you IMDb for the site, so we can s watch trailers and help us to decide to buy a movie or not."

" This film really plays better as an epic
",0.6674,0.9946,2017-02-19 00:00:00,5,"This remake has a much shorter running time than the 1959 film, a mere 126 minutes compared to the 212 of the earlier version. The scenes that have been kept in are very similar in almost all instances to the ones from the 1959 version. I think even some of the dialogue is the same. One notable difference is the new version begins earlier in the Ben-Hur/Messala story. We see them as young men racing horses together when Messala is still living with Ben-Hur's family. Messala and Ben-Hur's sister Tirzah have clearly fallen for each other, much to the consternation of Ben-Hur's mother Miriam, who disapproves of a union between the two because Messala isn't Jewish and because he has no social standing. So, Messala leaves to fight for the Empire in Germania in hopes of ""making his bones"" so he can return someday and claim Tirzah from a proper position of wealth and status. All this is depicted in this version, rather than merely alluded to.The '59 version begins with Ben-Hur and Messala reuniting after Messala has become a legion commander and returned to Jerusalem. That scene doesn't take a place until a good half hour into the new version. Since they added 30 minutes to the story right at the beginning, they have left out a tremendous amount after that part! One time-saving device that was obvious to me, even with my memories of the '59 version being pretty fuzzy, is that they eliminated the Roman general Quintus Arrius, and had Sheik Ilderim, played by Morgan Freeman (virtually the only recognizable face in the cast), perform all the plot functions of both characters. This seemed a bit of a stretch, as I'm pretty sure that it was Ben-Hur's prestigious position from his association with Arrius that got him into the chariot race. In this movie, Ilderim just bribes his way in for himself and Ben-Hur. Also, with Freeman playing the part, Ilderim is no longer an Arab but a North African. The Romans keep calling him ""African"" as if that was his name to drive this point home.Jesus actually appears on-camera, full-face in this movie and has dialogue, some of which is taken directly from scripture (though not always in the same moment in time the Bible has Jesus saying those particular words). There seems to be a contingent on IMDb that's quite upset with the original dialogue given to Jesus in the movie, including a line where Jesus says something like ""given enough time, humanity's propensity for good will shine through"". Some Christians are arguing that no, the Bible says humanity is evil unless it accepts God. I have no interest in getting in a theological debate, just thought I would point it out because it's kind of interesting. I personally approved of this depiction of Jesus, who comes across as more human and relatable, as opposed to off-camera Jesus in '59 who's always accompanied by ham-fisted chorale accompaniment, a soft, holy glow in the lighting and beatific, almost stupefied looks on the faces of everyone who beholds him. This version is much more subtle in its Jesus depiction.One of the production companies involved with the film is run by Roma Downey of TV's Touched by an Angel and, I think, her husband. There's an interview out there where they make no bones about hoping to suck in the agnostic, especially the young, impressionable agnostic, with an exciting chariot race action scene and then hit them with some Jesus and hopefully make believers out of them. Some of the hardcore Christians on IMDb are accusing Downey of not actually being a true Christian because nowhere in the movie is it said that it was the sacrifice of Christ and Ben-Hur's acceptance of Him that expunged the hate from his heart and redeemed his soul. I think you could interpret it that way, but it's not expressed in any dialogue, unlike the '59 version, which hits you over the head with its Christian message.That chariot scene is pretty well-shot, a little over the top, with one horse running into the stands and several more spectacular deaths than the Wyler version. Also a truly over-the-top finish. I'm sure it was virtually all CGI, but CGI has gotten so good, I just kind of roll with it now and don't even try to spot it anymore.Finally, one major character who dies in the '59 version (and I assume in the novel?), lives in this version, and there's Hallmark-card sentiment forgiveness and reunion between characters who never reconcile in the previous version. And characters who probably would have parted company are all riding off into the sunset together at the end with a contemporary song by an artist named Andra Day playing during the fade-out and first part of the closing credits, which I found really jarring.I think I'd still prefer the silent with Ramon Navarro over both talking versions, and then the 1959 version over this remake after that. Charleton Heston in the 59 version just lends gravity to the proceedings that the actors in this one just can't seem to muster, and the story plays better as an epic with the Christian message of the 59 version being an embedded byproduct of the production code era rather than a rather contrived hammer with which to hit the audience over the head."
" Jerky Camera Work With Spots of Inaudible Dialogue
",0.0,0.91,2017-02-19 00:00:00,1,"Reflective of studios that choose to save money on camera stabilizing equipment by using hand held gear that adds nothing but cost savings Ben Hur is a prime example of how not to make a movie. Adding to this are cases of whispered dialogue such as during a pointless love scene and confusing leper cave interchange that is unintelligible (shame on the sound editor). Coupled with far too many quick cuts to simulate battles this production a chore to view. But wait...it doesn't end there. The script, although expertly acted by these professionals, is woefully choppy yielding severely underdeveloped story line. The one saving grace is the chariot race which produce some visual excitement but defies logic with the survival of a lamed Messala riding off into the sunset with Judah Ben-Hur. Stick with the 1959 version if your a fan of great historical action packed dramas."
" Stands on its own
",0.0,0.9316,2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Anyone looking for this ""Ben-Hur"" to overtake the classic version will deservedly be disappointed. This ""Ben-Hur"" stands on its own as some lively and moving entertainment. Yes, as in the original the chariot scenes and ships and oars and ramming speeds are the movie's best moments. But the rest of the movie seldom drags. The leading male actors don't have the gravitas of Charlton Heston or even Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"", but their friendship and eventual falling out is believable. The ending may not be perfect but it is emotionally moving. A theater patron can approach this version and criticize it for falling short of the original or they can appreciate this movie on its own merits, and possibly be entertained. I choose the former"
" Soulless crap
",-0.3818,0.206,2017-02-14 00:00:00,4,"I loved the old movie and re-watched it many times. I also loved the book and have read it many times.This movie is a soulless crap that can't get any emotions out of me.It's obvious that they were concentrating on the action and mainly on the race, and everything else was secondary.After the race I had the feeling that they said on the set ""okay guys, we got it, now let's finish this up quick, so we can go home"".The actors were completely boring and unimportant. I didn't care for any of them for a second.All the scenes, which should have had meanings or at least emotions, were just there to fill up the time until the race can begin and they were shot quick, because they had to be there."
" This is an incredible movie!!!
",0.0,0.9873,2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"I had heard that this movie was awful and a terrible remake. Well, I have never seen the 1959 version, but I am appalled that anyone would say this movie is awful. My husband and I LOVED it! We went into watching this movie with trepidation, thinking it would be maybe a 2. No. It's a 10 for sure. The acting, the fighting sequences and the addition of faith, which was in the original, are perfect. I was blown away. Give this movie a chance, with no bias from the 1959 version.I had not heard of the main characters at all except for Morgan Freeman, who gave an amazing performance, but they definitely have bright futures ahead of them because they were phenomenal! The visual effects were just stunning! The symbolism is subtle, yet if you pay attention you can certainly pick up on it. Nothing was done to excess in my opinion. Everything was handled with a very polished hand and the surprises and shifts kept you completely engrossed in it. I couldn't hardly look at my phone or I'd miss some nuance that was critical to the movie. In the end, everything came together, full circle and was concluded perfectly. I think if you didn't like this movie you weren't paying attention and missed all the well played subtlety. That is your fault as a viewer, not the directors', producers' or cast's fault at all. This movie is deeper than you think."
" Sadly, only a shallow cartoon of the great 1959 classic
",0.3182,0.9825,2017-01-27 00:00:00,3,"Perhaps I should start by revealing I read the book, quite early when I was in middle school, and was very moved by it.Then when I saw the 1959 classic with Charlton Heston, it was as powerful of an experience as the book. Not just the delivery by Heston, which was perhaps his greatest performance of all time, but the entire production had so much depth, character development, drama, all of it.An absolutely spectacular expression of the artform of filmcraft in its time it was, and as this latest remake so clearly indicates, sometimes the great classics are best left alone to stand as the icon of their time.Perhaps this latest remake could have been crafted with better development, direction, context and drama . . . but not even a close comparison can be made.This latest rendition is a flat, almost cardboard cartoonish attempt at recreating this story.Many other reviewers have offered far more detailed descriptions, which I won't bother to reiterate here.My sincere suggestion, though, is not to bother with the time spent to watch this production. To do so would be an entirely misleading and disappointing, hollow representation of the compelling story that this is.See the 1959 classic rendition of Ben Hur, or read the book . . . but seriously, don't bother with this one, lest it rob of the real experience this story can deliver.On a parting positive note . . .The high point of this film, aside from Morgan Freeman, is Andra Day's spectacular delivery of ""The Only Way Out""."
" How hard can it be?
",-0.1027,0.9793,2017-01-24 00:00:00,1,"How hard can it be to at least stick a little to the story? Hollywood seems to have huge issues these days, making remakes, but leaving the story out. If a story is good, you don't need to go all out to change it, you could at least use it to make a great movie, even a great remake. This isn't a great remake, this isn't Ben Hur, just another Hollywood corruption of something that is good. Shame, since the story of Ben Hur is awesome.... this movie is not.Now, if this was not related to the story of Ben Hur, this would have been an okay movie, but since they've called it Ben Hur, it should have at least stuck to the story a little. As with so many great stories and books, they've turned this into another waste of time."
" Really? What is next now? A remake of Mary Poppins? Inferno tower remake then?
",0.0,-0.6423,2017-01-14 00:00:00,2,"Just watching the trailer was enough to see how ridiculous this movie is. Is a total failure. This is really an insult to the story itself of Ben Hur. And it does not matter if this version has great effects or because better actors come out. Can not overcome the classic version.It is really painful that now Hollywood wants to repeat stories that have already been told, many times. This abomination of film is the classic failed attempt to overcome a story like the classic 1959 version of this story.And now which of the classics, will they want to retell? Seriously,stop already ruining the good stories. Now they are going to say that soon they will bring a remake of Titanic or Pearl Harbor. Or maybe a remake of lion king."

Star Wars Force Awakens, Ghostbusters, Star trek so on and so forth ... lame Number two yes Hollywood Jews are always wronged and oppressed and suppressed and we need to give more of our money to Israel and give them free weapons and give them aid and pass laws banning free speech so Jews feel like they can be secure settlers... got it.. OK really got it.. now can you stop inserting the Jewish indoctrination into every film? Ben-Hur? more like Ben Whore of a movie I think I will watch Chinese movies from now so I don't have to be brainwashed into watching fairy tales about jews by jews and at least watch something new not another reboot, spin off, sequel, prequel, remake, remade vomit"

" Only even rates 4/10 if you haven't seen the 1959 version
",0.0,0.9285,2017-01-05 00:00:00,4,"It's difficult to compete with the 1959 Ben Hur, since it's one of the best movies ever made. So I'm trying pretend that I haven't seen that version at least half a dozen times, and consider this 2016 version on its own merits.Unfortunately, it doesn't really have many. The chariot race is nicely done -- although there are a couple of CGI glitches, the close-up action is very engaging. It's one of the rare places where this version really does improve on the '59 movie. The cinematography is generally pretty good, although there are a few scenes that were not well lit (although that might have been intentional).It's really the acting that lets this movie down. Many of the characters almost seemed to be reading their lines from a card. And the lines themselves were pretty weak in places. Even Morgan Freeman couldn't do all that much with his offering. None of the actors -- with the possible exception of Mr Freeman -- really seemed to have the presence or charisma to pull off their roles. Of course, Jesus has big sandals to fill, and few actors have really done him justice; but all the parts seemed a bit, well, thin.This is a long movie, but it's still not really long enough to do justice to the story. There were a couple of places where the action was so condensed that I doubt I would have been able to follow the plot had I not been familiar with it already. The treatment of Judah's mother and sister was particularly sketchy, to the extent that this part of the story could have been omitted altogether with no great loss.All in all, had I really been able to ignore the 1959 version, I probably would have been able to consider watching this one two hours well spent. As it is, however, it's simply impossible to avoid unfavourable comparison with the superior movie."
" Ripoff of the original Ben Hur
",0.3182,0.7362,2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a joke I thought it was remake of the classic Ben Hur but it's not they put it as the title to gain interest. It just proves that no one in Hollywood can make decent movie. I;M NOT SURE HOW TO MAKE 10 LINES OUT OF THIS BAD MOVIE. The movie was a waste of money and time and the waste of some very good actors time. I might have had seen this movie in a better light if it had a different title but they trying ripoff the original movie. I HAVE NOT SEEN VERY MANY QUALITY MOVIES LATELY AND DOUBT I EVERY WILL AGAIN. The only good thing I saw from this movie is the good acting, but the director is a hack. The director and producer need to find a different line of work."
