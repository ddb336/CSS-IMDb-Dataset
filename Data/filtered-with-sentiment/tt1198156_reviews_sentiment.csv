" Never leave me alone
",0.2235,0.8553,2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,A moving friendship story that is accompanied by excellent performances; I highly recommend it.
" SIMPLY OUTSTANDING DESERVES A STANDING OVATION
",0.6124,0.9618,2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"I just watched this movie for the first time... and, wow... just wow. The acting, the dialogue, the scenery/setting, just everything about this film was beautiful and heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time. Tears streamed right from the beginning all the way to the end. Emmy Rossum and Hilary Swank's relationship in this film will make you laugh, cry, and wish you had a friend like that. Just watch this movie and let your own judgement decide if it's amazing or not."
" Storyline lacks depth imo
",0.0,0.7197,2020-09-07 00:00:00,5,This could have been so much more. Pretty much all the way through I was waiting for the story to pad out. Hilary Swank doesn't disappoint though.
" Tearjerker!
",0.0,0.8788,2020-08-02 00:00:00,6,Very emotional Film! Great Acting by Swank & Rossum! It's well worth a Watch! 6/10
" Swank and Rossum at their best
",0.6369,0.9783,2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,"Hilary Swank and Emmy Rossum were perfectly cast in these roles. Their onscreen chemistry is amazing and they both hit it out of the park with their performances. That alone is worth the watch.You're Not You did a good job tackling tough subjects and themes - the horrific disease of ALS and caregiving those with terminal illness. It would be easy for such a film to botch such heavy subject matter. Thankfully, that's not the case here.I found the most emotional moments also the most subtle. It veers into the melodramatic and emotional manipulation at times - but never too far. As Emmy's 'Bec' strives to empower Hilary's 'Kate', the film itself succeeds in empowering viewers in all their life challenges.Emmy Rossum basically portrays her Fiona character from Shameless - but it works really well in this setting. She's definitely one of my favourite actresses. One of my favourite scenes was the piano-playing scene towards the end. The whole film reminded me a lot of The Intouchables though not quite in that same league.It will definitely have you reaching for the tissues and guaranteed to have you laughing, happy-crying, sad-crying and everything in between.If you felt the film ending a little too abrupt or sad, make sure to watch the end credits. It was a nice way to finish."
" Dudes don't cry
",0.3724,0.1943,2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Well in this case they do. Hillary Swank masters the sad endings like no other, but leaves you amazed. In this role, she forces you to drop tears and finish the movie with odd feeling. I don't know how a movie like this has no Oscar nominations.Great acting, story, jokes! do NOT listen to bad reviewers, they are just jealous."
" ""Did you ever hear me complain?""
",0.0,0.9944,2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Oh my God, what a movie! I watched it mostly because of Emmy Rossum, who I discover in Shameless US, and I definitely do not regret making this decision! It is beautiful, sad and heart breaking. If you are looking for a movie that will make you cry, this is for you!The story is amazing. A woman who is suffering from ALS decides to fire her old caretaker and to employ this young, inexperienced woman to take her place. At first, things are shaky. (I suppose she regretted her decision on more than one occasion the first day!) But regardless, she asks her to come again the next day. As the two women grow accustomed to each other, a beautiful friendship that goes way beyond the original employmen emerges. They are more than boss-employee. They are true friends. They trust each other and each of them brings something out of the other. They help one another evolve, becoming who they were truly meant to be. This is why this movie is so beautiful.The cast was excellent. I never thought Hilary Swank would be able to portray her character as well as she did. She will surprise you, I swear! And Emmy Rossum, as usual, delivers an amazing performance. Her character is portrayed truthfully. The rest of the cast is also really great and that makes the movie stronger.The ending will make you cry. No matter how much you think you are prepared for what is coming, no matter if you know what is going to happen or not, you wil cry. I can guarantee it."
" With the deepest respect for the sufferers
",-0.0772,-0.7282,2020-02-03 00:00:00,1,"The only clear message from this movie is that ALS is a dreadful degenerative disease, currently incurable and causing the death of patients within five years.The story of youngish and rich Kate and her most unlikely caretaker Bec is just not particularly good. Compared - for instance - with Still Alice, everything about this plot seems over sentimental.I am not a fan of Swank, and it is still a mystery to me how she got two Oscars, since her filmography is pretty mediocre. She usually plays sad-sack sufferer and this yet another of those roles.I am not a fan of Russum either, and her character is a collection of stereotypes: the ""free spirited rebel"" (AKA girl who sleeps around) who wants to do something ""useful"", despite having zero experience.Totally unbelievable how a wealthy family would pick an incompetent girl to take care of somebody seriously ill. Besides, Rossum looked a bit old for a college student.Poor Duhamel, as unhappy husband Evan, is given a difficult role and does a decent job with, but not enough to save this paint-by-numbers movie. The mothers were totally unnecessary, but I guess they filled up some time and perhaps their presence added a touch of Steel Magnolia drama."
" Likeable cast - some plot holes.
",0.4588,0.9451,2019-11-23 00:00:00,7,"ALS movie with an all star cast.
Emmy acts skanky well. Good range. Hilary is good but they needed subtitles when she was speaking towards the second half. The guys are too nice for the gals. Liked the well cast mothers Marcia and Frances - just right.The main character is perplexing. She sacks her maid and doesn't want her mother's help but then feels sad she ruined her husband's life. If she had just accepted the right help her marriage wouldn't have been strained. Another fault why would a wealthy woman have a Yamaha in her home?For a disease show this is watchable."
" So incredibly bad...
",0.0,0.9354,2019-09-21 00:00:00,2,"Wow, I am so amazed of how awfully bad this is. Since the fantastic ""Boys don't cry"" and ""Million dollar baby"" Swank's legacy turned into a consistent bad taste of picking poor roles or bad movies.
Until this day I regarded ""P.S. I love you"" as her biggest disgrace but the question is if ""You're not you"" is even worse!There's absolutely no chemistry between Swank and Duhamel, who more looked like he didn't give a flying duck through the entire movie. He has been a lot better in other flicks. And the chemistry between Rossum and Swank felt very forced, just like every aquantaince of Swank's character. I have never seen an entire ensemble being miscast before!Yes, there are a few scenes that were nice but the script was pretty unintelligent and Swank's acting even went full re*ard the longer her character's ALS advanced. Like, the pot scene was crucially hard to sit through, it was almost like getting a frikking stroke. Compare it to Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Hawking. Hell, Swank should even have recieved a Razzie Award."
" Perfectly just, credible, senstive
",0.6369,0.9725,2019-08-14 00:00:00,10,"I guess it has all been said before, Emmy Rossum (and I am usually not the biggest fan) and Hilary Swank are great, the ending breaks your heart like nearly no other movie - and you have seen it coming from the beginning - , it is wise, sensitive, just to all sides (the husband, the parents, the friends), and most of all: it is a much more honest and credible movie than the male version. The French one was a vehicle for political messages and to allow people to cleanse away their guilt and responsibility (keyword: allow stem cell research!) and to underestimate the torment of severe disabilities / diseases and be able to believe that it is not such a bad fate, it is nevertheless still funny, so forget about handicapped people and ways to prevent these diseases. (I am not denying handicapped people a worthy, funny life, absolutely not, but let's not neglect the necessities, don't find apologies to forget about the facts, and let's not forget the fact that the people concerned in these movies are at least pretty wealthy/ able to come by help). Anyway, a rare just, sensitive, extremely well done and well acted movie. Perfect."
" It isn't easy knowing your dying!
",-0.4015,-0.8129,2019-08-14 00:00:00,9,"Regardless of the other criticism watch this movie. You'll recognize someone you have known or someone you know now.
ALS is merciless and cruel. Watch this movie. The two main characters are portrayed beautifully. The others are easily forgotten.
Watch this movie. It isn't about the good guys vs the bad guys. It's about incurable, despicable diseases. There are too many. Watch this movie and let it pull you in. Then think about that one person you know."
" Superb acting by Swank and outstanding directing by Wolfe!
",0.8553,0.9974,2019-05-31 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie twice in the last week; I liked it very much the first time, but I needed to watch it again, with a more analytical perspective, to understand why I liked it. I found myself thinking about other Swank movies I liked (Benchmark Group 1), and others I liked that she was not in (Benchmark Group 2).After a short discussion of the movie with my wife, I was able to articulate myself the reasons why this movie captured me: Hillary Swank acts in this movie (and in most of her movies) in a way that she conveys the emotions and the challenges of the character without imposing, if you will, those onto the viewer. In other words, she does not try over-play the role to overwhelm the viewer with a direction of how we should feel. Rather, she pulls you into the character, and makes you think and explore how you would feel if you were the character. Her movies, thus, are more like a personal journey where each individual, and even the same individual at different times, might travel along a spectrum of emotions and thoughts. In my opinion, she achieves that by conducting a diligent study of not only the character, but also, the unexpected behaviors exhibited by such characters. So, this movie compares favorably to my Benchmark Group 1, and does give you the satisfaction you'd expect from the outstanding acting by Swank.The second element is the impressive directing by Wolfe. I am aware that he is not in the list of distinguished directors. Nevertheless, if you break the movie down to its scenes, you'll easily recognize that he had a plan he wanted to execute and he executed it well, just like Spielberg or Scorsese would do in their masterpieces. Wolfe put the parts together in such harmony and flow that, the outcome is an arcade that provides layers of emotions, yet with no one dominating the others. If you've ever listened to progressive metal/rock/jazz, you'll understand what I mean. There are multiple elements in motion, and they all fit nicely together, whereas each would be somewhat boring or mediocre, at best, in isolation. Wolfe'd directing resulted in a movie that is more than the sum of its scenes. So, that's the second reason why it comfortably meets my Benchmark Group 2.Finally, kudos to Rossum who appeared to be a good fit for such elements in the movie. I believe, her style of acting added so much flavor to the movie and deserves applause."
" Great touching movie
",0.6249,0.7351,2019-04-29 00:00:00,9,I love it great performance from Hilary Swank suffering of ELA and her caregiver
" Brings me to tears
",-0.2263,0.867,2019-04-13 00:00:00,7,"So many moments and feelings in this movie so many tiers.
Amazing amazing cast !!!"
" Painfully awful
",-0.7506,0.3649,2019-02-20 00:00:00,3,With all the suspended disbelief I could muster I couldn't believe anyone in this movie had ALS. The only thing needed to get hs to talk like that was have a pebble under get tongue and talk s l o w l y. Actors do it all the time. This movie was 100 percent pc certified in Hollywood so the lighter the skin of the actors the more boorish their behaviors (Ali Larter and the two mothers). The darker the skin the more noble though it does get three stars for mixed races eating meals and suffering together in the same movie. Having Hillary and Rossum coming from different backgrounds was totally pointless since Hillary couldn't rise enough to get down and dirty and really enjoy herself the first time in her life. You've seen this movie a thousand times before. Don't waste your money.
" Wow.
",0.5859,0.9418,2018-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Award winning acting by all in this movie but Hilary Swank, wow. She is amazing. Absolute must watch, bring Kleenex."
" I WANT TO SCREAM
",-0.34,0.9604,2018-11-25 00:00:00,10,"Kate ( Hilary Swank) has a great life. She is a successful woman, has a great husband (Josh Duhamel) and friends, she is accomplished on the piano and in the kitchen. Then she gets ALS, a degenerative deadly muscle disease. Kate doesn't want to feel like a victim. She eventually hires Bec (Emmy Rossum) a disorganized college party girl to be her personal caretaker. Bec is ""not girlfriend material"" and ""can't cook a Pop-Tart.""The two polar opposite women become close friends in another tear jerker. The film deals with the many mixed feelings of someone dying from ALS, feeling guilty for how they change and interrupt other people's lives, not wanting to be a victim, and feeling a need to do things for themselves, knowing they can't. They want to live and die both.Swank and Rossum gave outstanding performances, and I would be surprised if they weren't nominated for an Oscar.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. Discreet camera angles prevent any technical nude scenes."
" It won me over
",0.5719,0.7783,2018-10-25 00:00:00,8,"I didn't take to this one at first. The premise seemed to me ludicrous: Kate (Swank), a severely handicapped ALS patient hires Bec (Rossum), a spaced-out party girl to be her caregiver. The wisdom of this decision and that of the film in general dawned on me in waves.The characters are ultimately and invariably well written. Hilary Swank should be satisfied with her work here. Emmy Rossum wowed me by making a good part great. I have never been so unimpressed and then so compelled by a character. The film's atmosphere is not one of high cinema and ALS is not always accurately depicted, but everything to do with Bec's character arc is believable and executed to perfection.It is a testament to the worthwhileness and transformative power of purposeful living."
" Effusive
",0.0,0.8862,2018-10-05 00:00:00,10,Loved this movie... The kind of friendship shown by Kate and Bec is beautiful.
" Powerful!
",0.4753,0.8169,2018-09-24 00:00:00,10,This is one of the most powerful movies I've seen in a long time. And the acting was superb!
" Spot on, tearjerking movie about sorrow
",-0.5267,0.3223,2018-08-27 00:00:00,10,"I've never cried so sincerely to a movie than this. Having recently lost a dear family member to cancer, I can say, that the way the family and friends react to this sickness is very accurate.
So sad, yet brillant, movie. Should have better critic reviews."
" Love & support
",0.7845,0.4467,2018-07-16 00:00:00,7,"I knew little about ALS, it's so heartbreaking watching this condition played out the way it did through this movie and I take my hat off to those who fight and keep fighting through it and also to the carers who genuinely try their best to help enhance the quality of life of those suffering with this. It is worth the watch and would recommend it to anyone who are curious and Hillary Swank fans alike."
" Outstanding Film! A must see for anyone with a heart.
",0.6476,0.397,2017-09-19 00:00:00,10,"I don't care what anyone else says about the film. I'll just say Hilary Swank was incredible and totally believable in her role. I'm a 70 year old man. This was one of the best written and acted films I've ever seen. It also helped open my eyes a bit wider as to what an ALS victim, their family and their loved ones have to go though. I can't imagine why Hilary and this film did not receive more awards."
" Not bad, but not great either
",-0.5448,-0.9879,2017-09-09 00:00:00,6,"If I try compare this movie with ""Me Before You"", then I can say this movie much better. But some character is not remarkable. Swank's character is unrealistic, Duhammel's character look wooden and boring.And my biggest disappointed with this movie, what Mcmahon's character doing in here, so suck, awful, and asshole. Can't believe he take this role because so useless. C'mon.. can you imagine a person with title professor doing nasty scandal with his student? I thought his character more look like gigolo than a professor, there is no credibility. What a mess."
" Yes, I cried, so what?! :P
",0.5863,0.5859,2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"This is beautiful. Authors of ""Me Before You"" should watch this and then go to a corner to be ashamed of themselves. The ending song is really performed by Bec. Beside singing it, Emmy Rossum also wrote it. She instantly became one of my favorite actresses. However, ""The Intouchables"" still holds the throne on this topic.8,5/10"
