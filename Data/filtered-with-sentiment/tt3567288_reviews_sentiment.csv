" Twist is glaringly obvious, comedic moments work. Ok film.
",0.5994,0.8183,2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,"The film is pretty entertaining in a comedic way. Strong performances from the cast, especially the two younger actors.The supposed twist was very obvious but didnt spoil enjoyment. The boy is tolerable with his comedic chops but whoever told him he could 'rap' was woefully wrong. And he tried far too often. The cringe was real.The talking to camera / faux documentary style worked far better than I thought it would.I'd put this down as a hit for M. Night Shallaballadingdong. ..... In a career of hit n miss films.Worked well, some genuine creepy moments amongst the laugh out loud scenes.Worth a watch. But it's nowhere near Signs level."

" Why did anyone rate this so high? I want my money back...
",0.1477,-0.9544,2021-03-12 00:00:00,1,"This is supposed to be ""a terrifying story"" of 2 children sent to what everyone thinks is their grandparents. During their trip they record ""a documentary"" meaning the footage and camera viewing angles are like if a 10-year old should shoot a movie. And it's like that throughout pretty much the entire movie!!! But this isn't a professional movie. With this plot the crew saved expensive camera equipment and skilled camera professionals. Later it turns out that after nearly a week, what they thought were grandparents were psychiatric patients and they killed the real grandparents... How realistic is that? It's just an incredible bad movie, oh my, why the hell did anyone give this movie so high ratings?"
" Bored horror movie.
",-0.7003,0.1435,2021-03-12 00:00:00,5,"At the beginning, the film looked quite interesting, about how the siblings find out that there is something strange about their grandparents and they document everything on their camera. As time goes on, however, the film becomes more and more stupid and boring, where basically nothing much happens, and only at the very end there is a bit of action where we learn the whole plot of the film, which was clear from the beginning, and we will not see any unexpected and interesting ending either. Unfortunately, this film does not offer much horror scenes, and the fact that I should be afraid of this film is not at all. For my disappointment, I actually expected a little more from this horror movie."

I definitely predicted the end though. I was good
" Just a bait !

Many of this director's movies are incorrectly advertised as being part of such or such genres while they are not. ""The Visit"" is obviously not a horror movie and this very faulty categorisation explains why many people downvoted it.
""The Visit"" is at best a drama or a thriller and, even considered as such, is not so good."

" Don't hold onto anger
",0.4585,-0.8354,2021-01-27 00:00:00,6,The best thing about the movie was the kid actors. They did a great job and I immediately cared about them and Tyler was hilarious. The kids visited their grandparents for the very first time since their mother left her house for marrying an older man who's not approved by their parents at all. Becky was shooting a doc about this story and the two was walking around with their cams on videotaping everything. The hide and seek under the house was creepy as their grandmother joined and chased them. Tyler found out that grandpa is wearing diapers and keeping them in the shade. At night grandma was running inside the house fully naked and they said they must keep away from the basement as there's mold. Grandma wanting from Becky to clean the oven in the oven gave the vibes of Hansel and Gretel and at some point I thought it'd be a supernatural flick. Grandma accidentally damaged the camera of their laptop and they skyped with their mom her without seeing them. Kids complained to mom as the grandmother came to their door at night with a knife at her hand and wanted her to come pick them up and their mother saw her parents from the laptop cam and said they're not her parents. That was the twist of the movie that people hyped up. It turns out they were from a psychiatric hospital nearby where their real grandparents would volunteer and Becky found the body of her grandmother tucked in a box in the basement and the fake grandpa Locked him up in the bedroom where the fake granny was sleeping. Becky had to kill her as she attacked her. And downstairs the fake grandpa smeared his feces in his diaper all over Tyler's face and he was germaphobic. Tyler killed her with the fridge door and they went out as their mother arrived with the police. She said don't hold onto anger Becky and forgive your father who left us and it became a horror movie with a message. I didn't hate it nor was it boring but that climax that I expected never came and that left me a bit disappointed.
" Creepy AF
",0.0,0.81,2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"10 for creepy factor. Gripping movie and the suspense is kept alive right from when they reach the grandparents house. The twist is unexpected- they are not the real grandparents but escaped patients from an institute.
Their attempt at humor is good enough."

" Literally nothing happens for an hour and 20 minutes.
",0.0,-0.978,2021-01-20 00:00:00,3,"I started watching this, 20 minutes in I remembered I'd already watched it. After a while I realised how forgettable this film is.The first hour is tortuously dull. Two precocious kids take a couple of cameras to visit nana and gramps. And that's it. An entire hour of very, very slow storytelling with some emphasis on the uncanny. It's an unsuccessful attempt to develop an atmosphere of impending dread. I'mThe main problem with this film is the underlying premise that it's perfectly acceptable to send your kids off to meet your estranged parents, whom you've not spoken to for 15 years, while you go for a luxury cruise with your boyfriend. Why the hell would anyone in their right mind consider doing this?So the kids arrive at the grandparents and they are weird. Possibly senile or is there something more sinister going on?But this isn't normal senility, friends and neighbours are worried. And the plot plods along and gramps keeps his poo in a shed and nana goes mental and the computer gets mysteriously damaged and so on and so on.The Visit is clearly building up to a big ending but takes so long to get to the point that by the time anything finally happened I really struggled to care.Seriously nothing happens in this movie for an hour and 20 minutes and by the time it gets to the big twist the sheer idiocy of the plot really irritated the hell out of me."

" SURPRISINGLY SHOCKING & CREEPY THRILLER
",-0.0258,0.9901,2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I like the infamous Director SHYAMALAN & love some of his films such as THE HAPPENING (my fave of his) & SIGNS & THE SIXTH SENSE & UNBREAKABLE & SPLIT are all great films & then there's the likes of THE VILLAGE, THE LADY IN THE WATER, AFTER EARTH (Which are all decent enough films in my opinion even if not as great as the ones i mentioned before) & there's THE LAST AIR BENDER that I'm not interested in watching at all but his films are usually a good watch & are full of bizarre & Cool stuff & that goes for his sort-of Comeback movie THE VISIT!!!!Shyamalan's THE VISIT is a very well done mix of Found Footage, Horror, Comedy & Thriller as this is a blended mix of those Genres & it's surprisingly scary & disturbing as we deal with two kids, a teenage girl & her little 8yr old bro who go to stay with their estranged Grandparents who they've never met as their mum ran away from home to be with an older man some 15yrs ago & it's a weird step that the mum takes by allowing her kids to go to stay with her parents for a week because the grandparents reached out to meet them on social media & the mum being nice i suppose doesn't wanna keep the kids from finally meeting their grandparents as their old now & time isn't stopping. The setup is clever & weird but it gets better & better as the two funny kids got to stay at the old farm house in a wintery setting & set out to document everything that happens by filming & interviewing everyone they meet & things get weird & strange with their grandparents especially at night, scary old weirdos lol creepy stuff & the kids film what's happening & it's clever & that's where the Found Footage element comes in & i admit i was never bored during this move, it kept me gripped from beginning to shocking end & the performances are all superb from everyone in the film.
SHYAMALAN is back with this neat, slick & well made little Shocker, it's very low-budget considering the huge mega budget movies he had just made with AFTER EARTH & AIRBENDER & i like it more as it feels back to his old roots of very uneasy atmosphere & an intense build up to a surprisingly shocking end.
Some bits in this flick are really scary & frightening & not much creeps me out these days as I'm a big Horror fan but THE VISIT is a nice surprise & a great hit for SHYAMALAN who is still a genius he just needs to do more low-budget & personal stuff & here even in this creepy Thriller he has a heart to it & a family that's broken by their past & we find out what's bothering everyone as the film unfolds.A really good Creepy Thriller that's funny & disturbing"

" I'm so over found footage...
",0.0,0.507,2020-12-15 00:00:00,4,"Found footage in 2015 still?? They keep trying to find original ways to justify people running around filming everything. 'The Visit' is - in my opinion - a perfect example of a found footage film that is not believable.Ok, not the entire movie, but certainly for most part. The film is about kids visiting their grandparents for the first time, and they're filming everything ""for a documentary"". If I was a grandparent and a child I've never seen in my life were to film me every step of the way, I'd call child support right away! Its just not believable - not at all! Once they start suspecting something weird is going on, then yes, it makes sense for them to plant cameras around the house.The film became increasingly more sinister and creepy. Despite this, though, I already lost interest the moment the found footage couldn't be justified. And - to be honest - I actually found most of the story uninteresting and quite boring. There's very little explanation here. The twist ending did have the shock factor, but ultimately its not a film I'd watch again. It was ok for a first viewing. If you're into this sort of thing, rather watch 'Paranormal Activity' (the original). There's a myriad of haunted found footage films out there nowadays. This one didn't quite stand out as special."

" More Comedy Than Horror
",-0.2893,-0.5739,2020-11-18 00:00:00,3,"M. Night Shyamalan's 2015 The Visit, which follows the misadventures of siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge), who conveniently appears to be invested in making some sort of documentary, giving the film the perfect excuse to slip in a bit of the ever-popular found-footage style, and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), an almost impressively annoying aspiring rapper, on a trip turned nightmare to their grandparent's house.
The movie, quite frankly, is funnier than it is scary. Between Tyler's horrific free-styling that's so cringe inducing that a dead body or two showing up on screen is a welcome distraction, and the over-the-top shenanigans of Nana and Pop Pop (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) that are more absurd than scary, it's hard to tell whether or not the movie takes itself seriously, and whether the humor is entirely intentional- which is where the problem arises. Shyamalan clearly tried to bring in some element of comedy to temporarily ease the tension, likely after past criticisms of his films becoming nearly pretentious in their seriousness, and while he should be commended for breaking away from his usual formula, he failed to strike a balance between the comic relief and genuine suspense of the film. Given that the movie is overflowed with horrific one-liners from Tyler and zany family moments between the children and their mother (Kathryn Hahn) who never quite grew out of her rebellious teenager phase, anything that came in between that was intended to frighten the audience instead came off as more of a slightly morbid comedy skit. The scene where Pop pop smears one of his used adult diapers in Tyler's face might've been genuinely disturbing, but given the surrounding context, it inspires more shocked laughter than gasps of horror (it's also quite hard to feel sorry for Tyler, given that his only characterization seems to be centered around making him as annoying as humanly possible). Nana launching herself at Becca's rolling camera in the middle of the night seems more like an overzealous parody of the Ring, and her request for Becda to get in the oven, reminiscent of the Hansel & Gretel folktale, feels like such a cliché piece of dialogue that it can't possibly be part of a serious script.
Beyond the less intentional humor of the film, the characters themselves aren't exactly well-crafted, and it becomes quite difficult to root for them as protagonists. Becca is extremely one-dimensional with her supposed documentary acting as her central character trait. Tyler is a living, breathing cliché of what I imagine most adults think a young teenage boy is- criminally obnoxious and mildly sexist, with the extra 'dimension' of him being violently germophobic added to set him apart. The mother is absurdly immature, as she's apparently held a grudge against her parents since before her children were born for a fight she caused after she hit her mother, but is suddenly ready to reconnect just long enough to dump her kids off with them so she can go party on a cruise with her new boyfriend. All of these characters are nearly impossible to sympathize with, (it truly becomes a matter of whether or not you hate the kids or the mother more- in the later case, one might pity the children for having to put up with her). All of them are forced into unearned character arcs that attempt to strong-arm a thinly-veiled 'lesson' in at the end to give the movie some depth.
Some have made the case that, with the right actors, this film could've struck the particular chord Shyamalan seemed to be aiming for. I would argue that it's just the opposite: the cast did the best with what they were given, but no amount of talent could've ever gotten this script off the ground. The written dialogue was often forced and cringe-worthy, especially for the kids; the child-actors in this film are actually quite talented, but their lines feel as though they've been written by someone who's never spoken to a teenager before and only understands them in the abstract. Overall, the film fails to be horrifying in any other aspect beyond the quality of its writing, and the suspenseful scenes are overshadowed by the overzealous acting and unintentional humor, causing them to fall completely flat. It certainly breaks the mold of Shyamalan's other films, but perhaps not for the better.
In the end, it's a good laugh, and I'd recommend it for anyone looking for someone looking to entertain rather than frighten themselves."

He didn't direct it.
These dumb kids did. That's why this is so bad. These dummies were the only ones on set. They had no parental supervision. That explains the atrocious acting,The cringe freestyles, and the 90% of nonsense that this film consisted of. Very very very bad movie.Good fun to laugh at though!

",0.4404,0.9961,2020-10-19 00:00:00,9,"A compelling, well crafted, and incredibly unique little caper- The Visit not only reaffirms Shamalyan's talent- but also provides something new and well made- even despite its smaller budget. First off, the acting in the film is great. As always Olivia DeJonge is a standout, but the biggest standouts of the film have to be Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie who play the grandparents. Kathryn Hahn and Ed Oxenbould also do their best, but at times you do feel like they are pretty much playing themselves. I enjoyed the handheld camera point of view throughout the film, and thought it truly encaptured the claustrophobic nightmare that these children have been trapped in. There are certainly some funny moments throughout, even some attempted scares that can earn a chuckle, but there are also quite a few decent scares and of course a shocking twist that makes the film all the more better. I enjoyed the look of the film too, and thought the house in the middle of the country in the winter time truly added more to the atmosphere as well as the many other visual nightmares that took place in it and around it. In the end, The Visit is easily one of Shyamalan's best and is easily one of the most simple but original horror flicks in some time.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
" GARBAGE!!!!!!!

The grandparents are also incredible actors, I've worked with a lot of elderly patients and it really got me how realistic they were acting (apart from the real horror parts ofc).
The ending is a little weak, the scariest parts aren't in what is supposed to be the ""peak"" but it still doesn't take away much from the movie, the rest is just so good."

The Visit is a very well acted thriller along the lines of Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch style cinematography.

" Another dud from M. Night Shyamalan
",-0.25,0.99,2020-08-24 00:00:00,2,"It would appear that M. Night is one of those one hit wonders. He had great success with the Sixth Sense (which is a great film), but since then he has had some real turkeys like The Village and The Happening. The Visit is another that falls into that category, though it's not nearly as bad as The Village.
The film keeps you guessing, which is one of the only good things about it, you're left wondering what's going on with Nana and Pop Pop. Unfortunately with a lot of this sort of thing, what you imagine might be going on is much better than the revelation of what is really happening. Like when horror films only give you glimpses of the monster and the full reveal is disappointing (I'm thinking Jeepers Creepers here).
Nana's bizarre behaviour has you wondering if she's possessed or some kind of alien, but the truth is rather dull.
From one piece of clothing found in the basement, we're led to believe that Nana and Pop Pop are mental patients, however this just leaves you with questions, not least of which is how did the two escape? Also what kind of idiots share personal information with mental patients? The actual grand parents told the imposters that not only are their grandchildren are coming to visit, but they tell them exactly what day they're arriving and what time. Unless of course the real grand parents simply tell the mental patients that their grand children are visiting and then the mental patients escape, take their place and then arrange the full details of the trip? Seems unlikely.
Also, for mental patients, Nana and Pop Pop are convientiently lucid and 'normal' a lot of the time.
Overall, the Visit, like a lot of Shyamalan's films, could have been better. A good film premise, but let down by the revelation/twist toward the end."

Plot is about a brother (Ed Oxenbould) and sister (Olivia DeJonge), whom their mother sent to their grandmother (Deanna Dunagan) and grandfather (Peter McRobbie). In my opinion, Shyamalan managed to rehabilitate himself after previous films. He was able to make not a bad film. Cinematography is generally not bad for this genre. There are no questions about acting, the children got used to the role very well, each having their character, and the adults perfectly showed the distraught old people. The plot is standard and obvious. Worth seeing."

",-0.1154,0.9729,2020-05-10 00:00:00,4,"When I prepare to see a film directed or written by Night Shyamalan, I never know what I'm going to get. As I said in other reviews of his films, he has creativity but does not always get a positive result from his effort, going from genius to goofy at a glance and having brilliant films with a lot of mediocre efforts in between.In this film, two brothers go to visit their grandparents so that their mother can go on vacation. They have never seen their grandparents, or at least they have not been with them for years, and the elderly seem radiant and everything is going well... until grandma begins to reveal somewhat strange habits and everything starts to look tense. The script plays well with signs of senility and alzheimer's, which are common among the elderly, to create a tense environment that also spreads to the audience. However, other than that, the film has little story to tell and high doses of melodrama that clash a little with the global picture. The film contains a twist near the end as the director usually does. This turnaround is good and prepares the final climax, worthy of a horror movie... but this ending is too long, it would have had more impact if it were shorter and more sudden.The cast is headed by two young actors, Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould. Olivia stands out clearly and shows promising signs about her career. The grandparents, Peter McRobbie and Deanna Dunagan, were also very good, truly convincing in the way they brought their characters to life. Deana, in particular, deserves real praise. At the opposite end is Kathryn Hahn, totally artificial as mother. This character was very poorly thought and sounds false all the time.Technically, the film is poor, perhaps even the poorest of the Shyamalan work I have ever seen, with strict regard to production values and technical aspects. The idea of young people recording testimonials for a kind of homemade documentary sounds false and only works as a justification for a ""found footage"". The total amateurism of cinematography, which is almost always shaky, out of focus, without light or too bright, clashes with the number of professional cameras that children had at their disposal, always appearing in the shooting angle of each other. If the idea was for children to shoot an amateur film, how can the cameras be so many and so good? Did they have wealthy parents?Okay, I recognize that this film is not one of the worst in Shyamalan's career. But the fact is that it is also not a success or deserves to be seen more than once. With poor production values, a little-known but capable cast, a weak story, full of inconsistencies but that manages to intimidate the audience, is an average and forgettable film."
" A film of two halves.
",0.0,0.9683,2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,"M. Night Shyamalan swings from 'pretty darn bad' to 'unbelievably good' from one film to the next, but at least he dares to be a bit different and try the odd detour from the ordinary. For the first half of this film we kept looking at each other and wondering whether to continue, as it seemed to be shaping up to be just another found-footage film with the usual annoying kidz. Plenty of padding with the boy practising his rapping skills and the girl mooning around. THEN comes the surprise right out of the blue, when the kids contact their mother and she tells them something that puts a whole new light on the holiday. From then on the film gets some petrol in its tank and moves up a gear. The Visit was clearly shot for pennies, but it's good entertainment and its use of music makes a difference too. By the time the credits rolled, we were more than impressed."
" This is what hand-held camera found footage genre is all about. Minimalist horror.
",-0.5719,0.9238,2020-05-05 00:00:00,7,This defaintly one of the best movies to employ the found footage/ hand-held camera style. There has been other successful films but this among them at the top. Camera work is very good considering its limitations. Very creepy and chilling minimalist horror that will make you very uncomfortable. It does't depend on cheap thrills or CGI but works with its natural spooks. The grandparents actors do an amazing job both eerie and familiar at the same time. Unfortunately the film also comes with certain amount of cringe. While some of the back story filimg is good the children actors can be over bearing at times. This one overall is one you should visit.

After positive beginnings things start to go very wrong quick.The film dips into the found footage film that we have seen brilliantly implemented in films such as The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Cloverfield (2014). Despite this similarity the film is fairly original.The film uses a lot of jump scares that effective I for one can say I was certainly scared. One of the main reasons for the films terror is Deanna Dunagan as Marja Bella Jamison (Claire), also known as ""Nana"". Dunagan is brilliant in her role and truly terrifying.For all its scares the film could actually be categorised as a comedywith the lovale rapping Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) providing much of the comedic relief.The Visit is an excellent film.

" M. Night has slightly redeemed himself
",0.2516,0.9929,2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"This very much hearkens back to late '90's/early 2000's M. Night Shayamalan back when he still cared about his career.
Does it make up for atrocities like ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth""? No, but let's be honest, we'll probably never be able to forgive him for those. But it feels in the style of his earlier films like ""Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village."" The plot is a bit slow in parts, but that's to build up to a great twist ending I didn't see coming, and made the last half hour of the movie absolutely terrifying. This film has it all: Mystery, suspense, even a little bit of comedy. I'm glad M. Night is trying to make great films again. How long will it last? Only time will tell. But for now, I think it's safe to say that M. Night is back on track. Even if you're not a found-footage fan, give this film a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how well done this film is. The kid actors feel genuine. They talk how real kids talk, they act how real kids act. That's a rarity these days. Usually child actors overact, or don't feel genuine. I'm glad to see that's not the case here. Overall, ""The Visit"" is a pleasant return to form for M. Night Shamalayan.

They are daring and individual. Unfortunately that's where the good stuff ends. The translation into a gripping and tense experience did not work for me this time. Yes the iconic twist about the grandparents who are not what they pretend to be is strong. There are a few creepy and almost disturbing moments and I'd have loved to see a more classic approach to it. This found footage worked only once in the Blair Witch project as it was absolutely unique at that time. All other tries are,....well tries. The main complain however was for me the cast/acting of the two kids. Especially the boy and his singing ruined for me the complete movie. I was upmost disappointed and found it a pity to loose such an interesting story to such a film."
" Two thirds annoyingly boring, final third is great!
",0.4753,0.9837,2020-03-18 00:00:00,5,"Redeemed slightly by the central kids performances towards the end, suspenseful goings on in the final act and a pretty awesome twist! Becca and Tyler (Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould) are off to visit their grandparents (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) for a week. Very quickly they begin to realise something is very wrong with their Nana and Pop Pop and begin to investigate with the help of Becca's camera. It's a very simple setup as often some of the best horrors are but unfortunately it does miss the boat which is mainly due to the kids being annoying for the most part, particularly Tyler's rapping played for comic relief which is pretty misjudged. Once would have been fine but we get it a good four times throughout the running time. Crucially though, it's not particularly scary and if anything just quite comic during the scenes intended to spook. The found footage sub genre is also the technique used for this one and it's just unfortunate this came at a time where we've seen so much of this type of horror and therefore feels predictable and bland. I'm starting to feel bad now so I'm going to start singing it's praises! Kathryn Hahn is fantastic as always as their mother and provides the more emotional scenes that work! The kids do get better towards the end in a pretty tense final sequence and Dunagan and McRobbie do their best with the material. M. Night's script starts to shine towards the end also making it more memorable"

" Limited moments of terror toward the end
",-0.6486,-0.9795,2020-01-08 00:00:00,6,"The whole idea for The Visit was pretty good, but the terrifying secret had to be revealed much sooner than in the second to last chapter (after at least six other chapters). And, had the terror been introduced in say, the third chapter, the filmmaker had to be prepared to come up with some sort of evolving torture, tension or chase, in order to keep us entertained for the rest of the picture, as is the case with many excellent home invasion movies. In a way I feel that this Director has only had half an idea for a movie, but he came up with another idea of how he could make half an idea work as a whole movie. That second idea is both the half-genius, and half-failure for this movie, and seems to involve framing the footage as a school documentary project, like Blair Witch (1999), only he's wise enough to avoid the camera shake and involve two cameras plus a computer, and a dash of good photography here and there. For me, however, the premise is dubious. The original premise, that an increasing demented and rapidly ageing couple first murder their companions, another old couple, then send for the grandchildren of the murdered couple (who have never met them). They start living in the murdered couple's big old house, assuming, with quite a sprinkle of public dotage, their identities. So far gone are these two oldies that they continue to struggle with their dementia even after the kids arrive. Obviously when the kids finally realise the couple are not their grandparents that's when the fun, belatedly, arrives. I get it. Terrifying. Thing is, the old couple are so demented that they easily bungle their attempt to kill the children. In any case, they must have known the gig was up should two innocent and much loved children disappear. I guess that's the point of the movie. Old people with dementia don't have logic. If this is a movie about dementia then it's in poor taste. If it's a quirky horror oddity, which I think is what the Director must have been aiming for, then it is moderately successful. But it's not all that scary, just odd, for most of the movie. Strangely, the false grandma tells a tale one day of aliens that infect drinking water, which allows them to incapacitate their human victims, keeping them alive but comatose and hidden at the bottom of a lake, ready for delivery back to their home planet. For a while I was waiting to see the alien hosts that must be causing all this illogical, sorry, demented, madness, you know, like that movie I Am Not A Serial Killer (2016). Alas, in the end, despite an alternate ending on the dvd, they never did actually appear."

Becca is an aspiring film director and films they entire thing They arrive and all seems well Nana is a sweet old lady who likes to cook and pop pop is a all busy farmer , usually out in the shed.
Things start to get eerie and strange when they notice their grandparents strange behavior, such as Nana running around naked at night and pop pop secretly hiding a secret in the basement and shed. They get weirder and weirder each night especially Nana.Without spoiling much , That's your basic story, and its not your basic found footage movie, Becca has some great shots and placements of the camera, it not shaky can or anything that will make you dizzy, it's a well filmed and executed movie. You get some great acting from both the kids and the grandparents, top notch in that department, the film has some humour, as Nana's actions can be so weird that its funny but still in a scary and eerie way, Tyler is the funny one, with his silly rap and using celebrity names instead of swearing.I will not spoil the twist for you, its is a rather good one, some will see it coming others won't, but in the end its not something I expected or the my friend I was watching it with.Overall I loved this movie, its great acted and written, scary atmosphere and just overall one of my favourites in the found footage department.

But I just find it so mean-spirited and even cruel to base horror on mental illness and senility that I wish I could give this a zero.But put that aside. Shyamalan is a good director but a lousy screen writer. Wish he would direct others' screenplays. I saw the predictable ""twist"" in this from the beginning (yawn). Shyamalan may be good at directing kids, but the dialogue he writes for them is either too cutesy or too adult.As for the plot, too much to go through all the plot points that make no sense (characters that appear, seem to have some role, but are never seen again). But the glaring fault is what evidently is the Shyamalan story telling gimmick: Mix a pop-psychology attempt at insight into family dynamics, you know to try and make the movie kind of deep, with a horror theme with scary bumps and shocks. This messy hodgepodge completely crumbles at the schlocky nonsensical horror end, followed by another attempt at hallmark card sensitive relationship theorizing.Really wish this guy would direct someone else's screenplay."

They talk about directorial tropes and then do them.I like to remain open minded to all found footage movies. I know a lot of inexperienced film makers think they are a quick and cheap way to get their foot in the door and so they can be so generic... But I still want to believe that there are still some classics still in the marble because what brings you closer to the sensation of reality than not even having to suspend belief for the camera?But I'm not sure what they were going for here. This meta approach to the subgenre just seems to detract from the real story here. It could have been a pretty cool slow burn but the the particular approach with the narrative just seems to dilute it.A few really effective moments notwithstanding, this makes little sense, is too convinced of its own intelligence and is falls back on the familiar heavy handedness of movies of this type way too often.Which is a great pity."

This format is old hat now, now sure that it was really necessary to go down this route, But it is reasonably well done. There are some truly effective scare scenes, but there is also quite a lot of humour too, though to call this a horror/comedy maybe be going a little too far.

",0.4927,0.9147,2019-07-13 00:00:00,6,"I found myself glued to the movie, surprised that the director finally might just have made a good movie after all these years. The suspense was real and at times too much for me. No fault there. The problem I had came late. It seemed to me like they ran out of money at the last moment and just slapped on an ending to finish. They never explained what exactly happened to both sets of old people and how one set came to live in the house and who they really were. Then there was a female visitor the kids met earlier in the film who was seen arguing with them, then the kids made a comment about how they never saw her leave but this too was never explained.Had these loose ends been tied up satisfactorily I would have given the film a 9. The ending just felt tacked on with none of the mystery explained. Before that though, there was an entertainingly tense thriller that was surprisingly good,"

Also, while I like a good build-up to the action, this movie takes way too long to get to where it needs to go.Not in the same league as the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, or Shattered -- not even as good as Glass, but still worth a watch -- just keep your expectations low."

",0.0,0.6248,2019-06-03 00:00:00,6,"I went into this movie not really expecting to care much about anything that happened, and I ended up kind of enjoying myself. This movie starts off in an extremely annoying way as both of our protagonists are precocious, insufferable teens, but it gets better when the children reach their Grandparent's house and crazy stuff starts to happen. I want to say first off that this movie is pushing the PG-13 boundaries; there are lots of genuinely creepy images in this, there's some pretty horrific violence involving teenagers, some swears, and even some old lady nudity. I was kind of surprised this wasn't rated R. As far as M. Night goes, this one was actually one of the better flicks in his filmography; it's nowhere near the level of ""Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", or even ""Unbreakable"", but it's a thousand times better than ""The Happening""."

Nonetheless, this has got to be one of the creepiest M. Night films to date and really shows what he's good at - executing horror like no one else. I was completely frightened the entire film and ultimately impressed with a plot unlike any other horror film these days. The idea behind it was fantastic and really set it up to be a great success. He did not disappoint with this one. It's nice to see a good horror film without the overused gore, terrible acting and typical storylines. The actors did phenomenal at bringing the idea to life and portraying all the right emotions having you feeling really creeped out. The plot twist was amazing and unexpected and made it an even better film than it started out as. Another amazingly, unique horror movie by the one and only M. Night!!!!!"

As the children begin to get know their grandma and grandad more and more they soon discover some very disturbing behaviour and the two children become more concerned.... and frightened.Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the film is made like a basic B Grade which is very different to the director's previous work (Unbreakable and Signs etc). The film even relies on the use of ""found footage"" style filming as young Tyler uses his video camera to document and capture the bizarre and scary moments which the grandparents keep displaying.To put it simply, The Visit is a tense film to watch. Because the film is done in a basic way, it can feel very realistic but it also would have kept the costing down when making the film (clever director).When it comes to grandparents, most of us could relate to spending time with them and can understand what to expect. This film matches those elements and of course takes this concept to the next level.When I watched this film I remember laughing at selected moments and also holding my cinema chair a little tighter as the film builds the suspense ever so well. The film raises many questions and thankfully delivers the answers by the closing credits with a classic M. Night Shyamalan twist and turn. While I was able to pick the ending and film's twist, the film still managed to give a heart felt message and meaning which I wasn't expecting, but found it made me rather thankful for the time I had invested in the film.Overall, I really enjoyed The Visit. Director M. Night Shyamalan goes back to basics in film making but still manages to deliver good scares, tension and a somewhat predictable twist ending. Definitely worth your time for those who enjoyed films such as Get Out even if the film doesn't warranty multiple viewing once you know the film's ending.6.8/10

" Entire movie shot from point of you of being a camcorder.
",0.0,0.9208,2018-12-16 00:00:00,1,"I HATE movies shot as if from a handheld camera. I'm still motion sick from having watched it. If I wanted to watch this kind of garbage, I'd watch other people's home videos. That said, I watched the entire thing, since I bought it (My bad for thinking that just because I like this director's other work, that I should buy this). It did have a story and some big surprises, but none of that made it worth sitting through for 1 hour 34 minutes. I sure hope someone else would like to buy this from me since I have no desire to ever sit through this again. Truly AWFUL! 1 star is being more than generous."

I would put this film on the same level as The Village. And there are parts of this movie that will haunt me for a very long time. It has its flaws (the first half isn't great), but this is a solid suspense film with plenty of humor. I would recommend watching it."

",0.4003,0.9669,2018-11-13 00:00:00,10,"The Visit is a movie that plays on the viewer's own pontential prejudices about the elderly. In some ways the film to me symbolises the difference between the younger generation and the the old timers; the youngsters today are perhaps more relaxed and perhaps desensitised to things than we perhaps used to be. And this is not
always necessarily a good thing.
There are creepy moments and a nice twist towards the end of the movie which keep it entertaining. The characters grow on you, the rapping is clearly a little bit of fun and it doesn't fail to make you laugh (Quote: I had to use two whole Dove bars on my face! ).
Worth watching for sure."
" Great little horror gem
",0.1761,0.9794,2018-11-12 00:00:00,8,"The VisitFormat: Amazon Prime Language: English Released: 2015Director: M. Night ShyamalanStarring: Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbieSomething I must confess before I start, I clicked on this film by mistake, but due to laziness on my behalf and the fact Kirk, (my dog) ran off with the control, I just couldn't be bothered to change it; which, as it turns out was a good thing, for I thoroughly enjoyed this little gem of a film.The film kicks off with Becca (Olivia DeJonge) interviewing her Mother (Kathryn Hahn), as to why she is not on talking terms with her parents. In this direct but short intro, you are not only given the full story of the family troubles and why they have them but also the plot and the style in which the story is told. This as it turns out, is shown entirely through the home recording of siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) in such an engaging way it adds to the end result and does not, as is with so many home recording style films, become boring or off-putting.What follows is a classic little story with so many twists and turns that it keeps you engaged (at least it did me) to such an extent you are genuinely caught off-guard at the end. This film is all about the story, which is a refreshing thing in these spoon-fed jump scares horror film times we are sadly made to endure. The hand held camcorder style of the film never once becomes annoying, the child actors are not only superbly portrayed by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould respectably, they are fully likeable and I really became concerned for them as the film when on. Without giving anything away, one scene in particular stands out for me.
When the siblings are in bed and you are shown something going on outside their bedroom door, it switches back in the room where they are debating whether or not to open said door, it had me shouting at the screen urging them not to do it!Such is Shyamalan's skill at direction, that this film is littered with these type of moments, it never becomes slow or repetitive but moves at such as pace it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Sometimes funny, sometimes moving, other times just downright scary, The Visit, never overstays it's welcome. This is reinforced by the characters in the film, as I mentioned before, the two siblings were portrayed perfectly but I feel I should also give a shout out for Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie for their portrayal of Nana and Pop Pop.This isn't to say that the film is perfect, it isn't; there are some areas that feel just a little out of place, some fillers that could have been edited out without anyone noticing but, the biggest gripe for me, was the 'post' ending. Again, without giving anything away, the film should have ended ten minutes earlier. The interview with the Mother at the end, explaining some answers to questions that where best left unanswered should not have been added; nor should the pointless 'funny' rap from Tyler at the end credits. This succeeded only in turning the film ending from a genuinely unnerving horror film to a film with a needlessly cheesy, family friendly ending, which was a shame.All in all however, if you ignore that post ending part, this film is a must for fans of horror, and driven mainly by a strong story and not jump scares or over-the-top gore, and is well worth your time."
" Flawed Found-Footage Flick
",0.0,-0.9915,2018-11-09 00:00:00,4,"Two young teenagers, digital camera filmmaker Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her rapper brother, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) travel to spend a week with their mother's parents, Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter Mc Robbie), at their remote rural Pennsylvania farm. In daylight the grandparents seem normal enough, with grandma cooking up a storm and grandpa doing his farming chores. But within a short time, the teens begin to realize that there are odd occurrences. Pop Pop has instructed the kids not to enter the basement or leave their bedrooms after 9:30 PM. Why does Nana have a penchant for nocturnal rages? What is Pop Pop doing in the woodshed? And why does Nana want Becca to crawl all the way inside the kitchen oven in order to clean it? It is all explained that the grandparents are old people who have strange ways.One has to wonder what the kids' mother (Kathryn Hahn) was thinking as she has not seen her parents since she was 19 years old because they apparently disapproved of her boyfriend, later the kids' long-gone father. She has recently reconnected with them, but not in person. But if she is so caring, why does she really let her kids go off on their own to the house of total strangers (to them)? Meanwhile she is more interested in the ""hairy chest"" competition on her cruise with her boyfriend when the kids are gone.Becca, who carries around a camera so that we see much of the movie through her eyes, is making a documentary about their trip (to share with mom later). Tyler also uses the camera. So there are some off-center framing and wobbly hand-holding camera scenes. And there is also the software application known as Skype, where one can speak to one another over the internet and also see them via webcam. In the end, what the viewer sees is Becca's final editing of her ""documentary.""SPOILER AND CRITIQUE: The director likes using twists in his movies, and ""The Visit"" is no exception. About three-quarters of the way through the film, Becca and Tyler discover that the grandparents they are visiting are not really their grandparents. Nana and Pop Pop are escaped mental patients who murdered their real grandparents (who were counselors at a sanitarium) and have taken over their lives. And now they want to murder Becca and Tyler for some unknown motives. The twist is flawed, however, for three reasons.First, a concerned coworker from the sanitarium visits the house to check on the real grandparents, who obviously are missing from work. The fake grandparents manage to dodge the coworker, who speaks only to the kids. But it must also be obvious that the two escaped mental patients have been missed from the place. Does someone not realize that something is amiss? And how were the escaped patients so cognizant as to arrive at the counselors' homestead?Second, the fact that Becca and Tyler don't recognize that the impostors are not their grandparents is supposedly explained by the fact that the kids have never met them before. But remember that Skype plays an important role in this story. The teens use Skype with their mom while she is on her cruise. Nana ""accidentally"" damaged the camera on Becca's laptop, so Mom can't see the fakers. Nevertheless, it is inconceivable that there was never a Skype call with the kids, their ""grandparents,"" and the mother all together. The real grandparents were internet literate as the hardwired network in the house is still operational for the teens.Third, although the kids are chased by murderers, they still carry the camera. In a life threatening situation, one would expect victims to drop their gadgets as they run for their lives!The acting is generally fine, but the teens are often annoying, and Tyler's rap scenes are terrible. Overall the film misses as much as it hits. M. Night Shyamalan had his peak with ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) but has not lived up to his high expectations. He still keeps trying though."
" Dude...
",0.0,0.7339,2018-11-09 00:00:00,3,"Dude... I mean, this whole movie it's hollow, from start to end. The only thing i found kinda remarcable it's the acting, and the brother-sister chemistry, but other than that... WHY would the mother let two under-age siblings travel across the country all by themselves, and not even check out if they are with they should be with. So much for basic script hollowness. But the jumpscares, and the suspense moments, are no better, every time the movie tries to lure you into ""will they do them something now?"" before the last third of the movie, the answer it's always ""nope, just recreating what will eventually happen at the end"", and that becomes boring veeery fast.
And i've already read a lot of people treating it like a comedy, a self-aware classic but ground-breaking suspense-horror movie. Sorry, but that's not what i saw, and if Shyamalan has taught me anything, it's that there is no extra layers on his works, not that it's a bad thing, but he simply plays by ear and it works for him (and his fanbase? I suspect he has one of those)."

" A different kind of nonsense
",-0.4576,-0.9589,2018-10-27 00:00:00,6,"Two highly irritating children are packed off to stay with the grandparents they've never met and know very little about while Mum flies off on a cruise with the new man. What could possibly go wrong?There are some interesting little twists and turns in this movie, alongside the big ones, and the unpredictability of the weirdness keeps it taut. As it turns out, although you start out wanting the kids to just die (especially the rappin' one), they've got their traumatic reasons. Watch out for them conquering those fears at the end; that's their redemption.The generation gap thrown up by this family union seems to be a couple of centuries - that's how it works.
As it plays out it's hard to say what will happen next; even the usual late escalation is not a forgone conclusion. There is more of an unfolding of information than a loaded spring, and glimpses into the unseen provide the creepiness and make it hard to see ahead. No apparent motive for the strangeness emerges until hinted at in the final scenes, by which time it doesn't matter that everything was nonsense.There's a refreshing, quirkly flavour to this movie, a spark or two of originality quite necessary when it's done on the cheap, and nothing too much like anything else. If you like psychological, low key horror that's out of the ordinary with forgiveable flaws, this is will probably satisfy."

" The Visit
",0.0,-0.995,2018-10-25 00:00:00,5,"It had been a long while since director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) had made a decent or worthwhile movie, notably bad films he made included The Village, Lady in the Water, The Happening, and The Last Airbender, well, he earned a Razzie nomination for the ""Redeemer Award"" with this scary movie, which I was looking forward to. Basically two siblings from Philadelphia, fifteen-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and thirteen-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), are preparing for a five-day visit with their grandparents while their divorced mother Loretta (Kathryn Hahn) goes on a cruise with her boyfriend. Loretta reveals she has not spoken to her parents in fifteen years, as they disapproved of her marrying her high school teacher. Having never met their grandparents before, the teenagers plan to record a documentary about their visit using camcorders. Becca and Tyler meet their grandparents, referred to as ""Nana"" (Deanna Dunagan) and ""Pop Pop"" (Peter McRobbie), at a train station. Arriving at their farmhouse, they are told never to go into the basement because it contains mould, and it is bedtime 9:30pm every evening, after which they shouldn't leave their room. The first night, after bedtime, Becca goes downstairs for something to eat and is frightened when she sees Nana projectile vomiting all over the house. She tells Pop Pop, who dismisses this, saying Nana suffers stomach flu, and reminds her not to leave their bedroom after 9:30pm. Over the next few days, Becca and Tyler notice their grandparents exhibiting more strange and disturbing behaviour. Tyler walks into the shed and finds a huge pile of soiled adult diapers, Nana tells them that Pop Pop suffers uncontrollable and embarrassing incontinence and was hiding it. Becca asks Nana about the day Loretta left home, and Nana begins to shake and scream. Later, Pop Pop and Nana are confronted by a woman who joined them in counselling, she goes with them into the backyard, but it never seen leaving. Concerned about recent events, Tyler decides to secretly film what happens downstairs at night, but Nana discovers the hidden camera, takes a knife, and tries unsuccessfully to break into the children's locked bedroom. Becca and Tyler view the camera footage of Nana with the knife, and video message Loretta, begging her to come get them. They show Loretta images of her parents, and she panics and says they are not her parents, she promises she will come and get them, and will call the police. The teenagers now realise they have been with strangers all week, they try to leave the house, but Nana and Pop Pop trap them inside and force them to play Yahtzee. Later, Becca sneaks into the basement to investigate, there she finds the corpses of the real grandparents, along with uniforms from the mental hospital at which they worked, revealing the impostors as escaped patients. Pop Pop grabs Becca and imprisons her in his bedroom with Nana, who tries to eat her, while he torments Tyler psychologically by smearing his face with his dirty diaper. Becca fatally stabs Nana with a glass shard from a broken mirror, then runs into the kitchen and attacks Pop Pop. He gains the upper hand, but Tyler knocks him to the floor and kills him by repeatedly slamming the refrigerator door onto his head. The teens escape outside unharmed, where they are met by their mother and police officers. In the aftermath, Becca asks Loretta about what happened the day she left home, she says that she and her parents had a major argument, during which she hit her mother and was struck by her father. Loretta ignored any attempts for her parents to try and get in touch with her, she concludes reconciliation may have happened if she wanted it to. Also starring Celia Keenan-Bolger as Stacey, Samuel Stricklen as Conductor, Patch Darragh as Dr. Sam and Jorge Cordova as Miguel. Presented as another ""found footage"" movie, it is obviously trying to go somewhere toward the reputation of The Blair Witch Project, it also has the annoying moments with the teenage boy doing on-the-spot raps, apart from these little niggles, it is simple and scary stuff, as you slowly realise the estranged relatives are not who they appear, first nice and cuddly, then being weird and terrifying, the twist works pretty well, and the shocks are effective enough, so it all adds up to a reasonable horror. Worth watching!"
" Well Made, Pulls It Off
",0.2732,0.9115,2018-10-20 00:00:00,9,"I love it.I had thought it would be a parody, like the Scary Movie series. The jokes, the setting and even the horror made it look that way. Two hours later, it was oddly satisfying to finish the movie.The genius of this movie is that it balances real horror with tongue in check humor well. The characters are also very well played. The two kids have chemistry together and act as real siblings.For me, this was like a grown up version of Scooby Doo. It will not scare you as ""IT"", nor it will entertain you as a full blown comedy movie, but for what it wants to be, it is good. It is definitely better than many +100.000.000 USD blockbusters I've seen lately or even many similar horror movies.Watch it and don't worry about the snobs posting 1 / 10 reviews."

" The Visit - Spoiler Free Review
",0.5106,-0.5643,2018-09-20 00:00:00,4,"In 2008, M. Night Shyamalan brought us 'The Happening', then in 2010, he brought us 'The Last Airbender' and then in 2013, he brought us 'After Earth', it would literally have taken effort to create a movie that was half as bad as any of those and that's why, when he released 'The Visit' in 2015, audiences went nuts for it. Now, I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but this movie is still really bad; was it better than his previous efforts? Of course it was, all the movies I just listed had been the quality I'd expect if a producer gave Tommy Wiseau a Hollywood budget and told him to make a movie, they were absolutely irredeemable and anything would have been better, case and point: The Visit. 'The Visit' stars Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould as two overacting siblings, who are going to meet their estranged grandparents for the first time. Olivia DeJonge, staring as Becca, is making a documentary about the trip, in an futile effort to try and solve the mystery of why their mother had walked out on her parents and never spoken to them again. Yep, you guessed it, Shyamalan has made a found footage film...this gimmick had been getting old for a while and Shyamalan does not help this fact. During their visit, the grandchildren begin to discover some really weird things about their grandparents and try to discover what's going on; that's the plot. At the core, this could have been an okay movie, the plot is simple, not particularly original, but still fun. The twist actually makes sense, and although many claim to have seen it coming, I can't say that I did...simply because I didn't think Shyamalan was capable of coming up with one that was just regular The problem is though, this is obviously still a Shyamalan film, the acting is horrendous, not necessarily because these are all bad actors, but because they're acting in that over-the-top way that is a trope in any of his films. The 90 minute running time is also filled with nonsensical scenes that go nowhere, offer nothing to the plot and actually just make us like the characters even less. The dialogue sounds unnatural and is very unevenly written, with characters acting like 'Rug Rats' in one scene and adult characters in the next. The grandparents, portrayed by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie, are genuinely creepy at times but lose their edge as the film progresses, obviously not knowing what to do with their badly written characters. I think what stood out the most for me though, was how incredibly long this 90 minute film felt, it simply could not keep my interest and had me reaching for my phone several times, just to have something else to do. It was simply that boring of a film. Now I will admit that 'Split' the movie Shyamalan released one year after this, was a much better effort and did show that this man still has some talent left, therefore, if you're one of this people still watching his films in the hope of him again delivering something in the quality of his first two efforts, 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable', just skip this and go directly to 'Split', because this movie is simply too dull, average and unmemorable to ever really be enjoyable.
P.S.
I was going to be generous and give this 5 stars, but I literally deducted a point for the scene that played over the ending credits, which was simply the most out of place and soul crushing thing I've sat through all year. I hate you Shyamalan."

" Shyamalan's Worst Film to Date
",-0.6249,-0.9936,2018-05-16 00:00:00,2,"When I saw M. Night Shyamalama-ding-dong's name in the opening credits, I knew I had to take whatever was coming next with a grain of salt. However, I didn't expect to need the whole salt shaker. Truthfully, I wasn't expecting this movie to be THAT bad, but it is. ""The Visit"" is a new low for Shyamalan; embarrassingly bad, and bordering on unwatchable. It's one of those movies where you look at the time several times throughout, and by the time the credits are rolling, you want your time back-assuming you make it that far. This movie takes a few common horror tropes and mixes them together. It tells a very simple story-which needlessly drags its feet at times-from the viewpoint of two young teenage kids who are brother and sister. These two siblings go to visit their grandparents and things start getting weird-not an awful premise for a horror flick. It's not the concept that's bad, it's everything else (and I mean everything). There isn't a single shred of quality film making in this mess, and ironically, the lead protagonist is an aspiring film maker. The cherry atop this crap-cake is that it's ALL shot with handheld cameras, so you get a full 94 minutes of shaky camera time. It's a head-scratching-ly poor choice of style for a seasoned producer like Shyamalan.Maybe if I was still a kid and wanted a ""scary movie"" with some very mild horror and gross-out elements, then MAYBE I would've found this entertaining. Alas, I'm not, and if you're anywhere north of sixteen, then you probably want to watch a real movie that'll actually entertain you. To put it simply; steer clear of this abomination. The only terror you'll feel is the horror of never getting that hour and a half back."

A lot of creepy moments are to be found in this movie and the acting of the grandparents is really impressive. I do hate the role of Tyler though, simply because I never ever would approve of anyone feeling the urge to rap. This is basically the only really annoying part and the movie would be so much better without this gimmick. Especially because this kid is not even close to being good or unique. It is not even that much about the acting but the question: What if this kind of scenario would happen to me, my kids, or close friends? Close to the end the movie gets really intense and it is definetely worth a watch, allthough the definitive ending ruins the experience."

Which is the first time that has happened in one of his movies since Unbreakable (most of his movies I cannot even discern what the twist was supposed to be). So some kids go to their grandparents house. The older child is an obnoxious, pretentious film snob -- one can only hope this is Shyamalan admitting to the world that he takes himself and his work WAY too seriously. The pertinent information is set up SO AWKWARDLY it is ridiculous. Randomly, the younger child starts talking about a past football experience that later becomes relevant. There HAD to be a better way to fit that in the story. The germ-phobia was also forced into the story so it could later be a plot device. That could easily have been worked in more elegantly. Also, haven't we seen the germ-phobia thing before? and the sports rage?I was not expecting much from this film, and it delivered.

However, I was willing to forgive the movie when it was used by the young boy at the start - I just skipped past it.Then there was the meat of the movie - yes, a nice build up of tension. It's a little unusual - I would have thought the kids would have started being more worried earlier on, but perhaps with their ""documentary"" they thought it was useful material and not overly bothersome.All good so far. Then the story takes a massive downward turn, crashing and burning into the ground. When these old people, who have dementia, attack the kids and the kids do almost nothing at all - yet amazingly they manage to hold on to their cameras the entire time! The girl gets locked in a room with the crazy woman - is that a POKER I spy that she moves the camera light over twice? Does she even think to use it to clobber the insane woman (who is under a bed sheet and can't even see!) or break the door? No! Likewise, the boy is in the kitchen with plenty of kitchen implements to use as weapons but does NOTHING. Then the girl arrives on the scene, having escaped (finally) and, well, you'd think she'd grab that big old pot in the sink to crack the old man's skull. NOPE! She just pushes him so he can get up and attack her.Useless and totally unbelievable dribble. I felt thoroughly cheated by the last 10 minutes. Don't waste your time with this - I honestly think those two kids could have written a better script and filmed it in a more believable way than this crap.At least I was saved from watching the credits. More (c)rap from the boy - I just shut the film off. There are very few films that make me angry and wish I had the time back that I invested in watching them - this is one of them. Avoid!"

For example when the kids used skype on their laptop in the kitchen, the grandparents are outside? Or when the counselor came over to check on up the grandparents because they didn't attend some charity event a few days ago, they were gone as well? 3) Why didn't the mother show a picture of the actual grandparents before sending the kids off? Why didn't the mother go along with them? Because she had to go on a cruise so she chanced her kids to strangers.4) Why didn't the kids question why there are no pictures of them in the refrigerator with the mother and how come all the pictures seem to be torn in half left on the refrigerator? 5) Why wasn't a red flag raised when the grandma intentionally avoids answering any questions when doing the documentary about the their mother? Because she couldn't since she doesn't know anything since she isn't the real grandmother.6) At the beginning of the movie, when the kids arrived at the house, grandpa told them not to go in the basement because there's a mold issue.

Whilst Becca is putting together a film which fuels 'The Visit' (found footage style), Tyler raps. If you can get through these little bursts of 'talent' (each rap ends with '...ho') without punching yourself repeatedly then you may well find these two quite appealing. They spout dialogue beyond their years perhaps, but they exhibit little of the brattishness you may expect with two juvenile leads.The two siblings are visiting their grandparents (Deanna Dunagan) and (Peter McRobbie) and observe them displaying bizarre and disturbing behaviour. Occasionally, this seems to be educating us that 'old people are gross' and reinforcing stereotypes that once you're over 60, you're senile and incontinent. But luckily, most of their behaviour is clearly portrayed as abnormal in an effective 'horror-film' kind of way.There is, however, no real progression here. The grandparents behave oddly and the kids are scared. Then the grandparents behave normally and the kids come round to them. This repeats itself throughout, but because matters don't go any further than that, the audience are continually placed back on square one.Being an M. Night Shyamalan film, there is a twist. SPOILER - their grandparents are not their grandparents. They're escaped lunatics. That's right. We are supposed to believe neither Becca nor Tyler have never been shown a photograph of the two relatives they are to spend a week with.The idea of a progressively unstable elderly couple seen through the eyes of young children could have been terrifying. But, apart from a couple of stomach-churning moments, it doesn't quite make it. And why does it take the police so long to arrive?By the time the end credits roll, another of Tyler's raps - he's dressed in baseball cap and gold chain, of course - 99% of an empathy you may have had for the character has well and truly disappeared."

The last airbender and the happening were both films that bombed horribly, which was shocking given that his previous movies like the sixth sense, signs and the village were all hits. This movie received positive reviews, and for good reason. The plot revolves around children that are being sent to stay with their grandparents, whom they have never meet because of a falling out between their mother and them. They begin to see once they arrive at their grandparents that things might not be alright with their grandparents. Their grandparents begin to act in very strange manners. For instance, the grandmother staying up all night and scratching the walls in the nude is one example of the frightening behaviors that go on while they are staying with them. The twists and turns that occur in most Shamylan films do happen here as well. And I for one really enjoyed the twists in the plot, made things much more interesting and exciting. I suggest this thrilling film to anyone who loves psychological thrillers or horrors. 8/10 for The Visit."

Over the course of his career, it has been well noted that his overall films have been criticized and not has great as his earlier films. The Visit is a more unknown and low budget found footage film and it is decent, although predictable. The film is quite short in running time which is enough for this time of genre. We understand and know there will be a twist in the end, and twist did elevate the film somewhat but could also have been done in a better and more revealing manner. The lead grandchildren were quite annoying but in today's age, this is how some kids act so the criticize from them is warranted.

It shouldn't have been very hard to write the kids' part but somehow, the writer just forgot that they are kids and gave them amazingly unrealistic lines.

Night Shyamalan started on a downward spiral from which many thought he would never claw his way back. The Visit isn't quite a return to the brilliance of his first two films, but it is a significant step in the right direction.Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould play siblings Becca and Tyler, who go to spend a week with the grandparents they have never met, their mother having left home acrimoniously at nineteen and never returned. Travelling by train, the kids are met at the station by 'Pop pop' (Peter McRobbie) and 'Nana' (Deanna Dunagan) who are excited to meet their grandchildren. Everything is fine at first, but as the days go by, the elderly couple exhibit increasingly bizarre behaviour, all caught on video by aspiring film-maker Becca, who is documenting the whole visit.This being a Shyamalan thriller, there is the obligatory twist to catch viewers off guard, and it works well enough, but the film doesn't rely solely on its unexpected revelation to succeed: the cast are excellent, the atmosphere is genuinely creepy throughout, the tension slowly escalating to a nail-biting climax, and for once, the found-footage/documentary format doesn't feel at all forced.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the freakiest game of Yahtzee ever, and for the gag-inducing 'shitty adult-diaper in the face' scene.NB If you're impressed by the two young stars of The Visit, check them out in the excellent Better Watch Out (2016).

Night Shyamalan and the end result is far more interesting than the rest of his work of the last ten years.I do like found footage films so I may be predisposed towards it. I liked this film's pace and the psychological twists are well done; the scary moments are funny, macabre, and inventive, more so than your typical jump scares you see in too many movies these days.

To tell you the truth the two only movies I really liked of him, were: ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". In my opinion everything went really downhill after this. Including ""The Village"" who was an over hyped movie in every respect.So going in this M. Night Shyamalan movie is always a leap in the dark for me. First of all when I learned this just was another home-video meets ""The blair witch project"" style of movie, I really wasn't keen on watching this movie. I don't know why but, I still gave it a chance. And I must say this is the first time this director didn't really disappoint me. First of all the home-video style really add to the suspension this picture so desperately need. Any other style would have done this picture no credit. So that was actually an excellent choice. Throughout the movie I never really got bored, it really did help me to duck in to the story. If you don't like this style of movie or filming, just stop reading here and don't watch the movie. You won't like it!The story wasn't nothing to refreshing, but it was done in the style that you still went with it. Most of the jump scares were predictable. I felt the jump scares weren't needed, just the whole eerie feeling was enough to make it a genuine horror/thriller picture.Acting by the grandparents was really well done. Magnificent. Concerning the kids it would have made the movie so much better if the boy was replaced by a better actor. Somehow he just didn't feel authentic, at all! Maybe they just tried to make him too funny. I never laughed once, and frankly it just put me off. The acting done by the girl was good.I give this movie a 7/10 because some things weren't done good enough to really make it a movie that would stick in my mind. But the things that were done well, were really done good. That makes it better than just average, and should keep you entertained for his length of time."

Soon after they arrive, things become increasingly frightening and they discover that something is terribly wrong in this house.The film fulfills its purpose and creates a scary atmosphere. As in many horror movies, the story is a bit over the top and not too realistic, which costs some credibility, specially when it comes to the illnesses of the elderly couple that seem to appear a bit too tailor made. The idea of having the girl record a documentary and the thus POV-style in some sequences are of course nothing new and thus not very innovative but they are included into the movie solidly and I didn't feel disturbed. In general, I like the plot and that makes up for a lot of potential that was wasted on the way by going for the shocking effect.All in all this is a solid horror movie, the term thriller is a bit of a false declaration in my eyes. It has some problems that many other horror movies face as well but also performs better than many of them.

However, The Visit was very good, up there with The Sixth Sense, a distant second. A very interesting story and very mysterious, it's true to Shyamalan's style.The camera work, which was more a ""found film"" style similar to The Blair Witch Project, was different than previous M. Night Shyamalan films, and fresh. Directed well, the actors actually do some of the camera handling, and the shots are from their point of view.You'd never expect the story to go in the direction it did! And I'm sure the children were terrified, as some scenes were terrifying. The actors playing the grandparents are scary and creepy, even before the end. The ending was a happy one."
" Creepy and Funny
",0.4404,0.8882,2017-06-15 00:00:00,8,"This film tells the story of a brother and sister going to visit and stay the week with their grandparents who they have never met before, the film is shot as if filmed through the kids camcorders as they make a film of their visit.For me this film was much better than i thought it'd be. I wasn't expecting much as it was a 'found footage film'and directed by M. Night who hadn't made a good film since unbreakable( until now with The Visit and Split both being excellent)but it was great I found it both creepy and funny in equal measure.The acting and direction were both good the only thing I could of done less with is the boys rapping.Overall great horror film which is genuinely creepy as well has having funny moments. 8/10"
" Not impress
",-0.3412,-0.9659,2017-06-12 00:00:00,1,"The movie seemed promising from watching the trailer but it was short in reality. It tried to mix present day issues with a horror plot which was just idiotic. Horror film has one purpose, to scare us off our wits, not school us in relationship. Hence the 1 star experience, it was just ain't there."
" Shyamalan returning to form.
",0.0,0.9384,2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"Starting with The Village, Shyamalan began on a steep decent into the pits as his movies grew increasingly shapeless, and preposterous.But here is a movie that allows him to get away with being both, and still have something to offer. Two kids hop a train to spend a week (or so) with their grandparents' who turn out to be more uncomfortably senile than they anticipated. With each passing day and night, their supposedly humble country home gets creepier. Shyamalan has found a couple of young actors who are good enough to carry the movie. One of the joys is that Shyamalan plays this picture partially for laughs, although some elders in the audience, or anyone whose parents suffer dementia might take offence at some jokes. In terms of horror, the film is lightly scary. Shyamalan manages to conjure some nail biting suspense in a couple of scenes but mostly what we get is a series of creepy one offs, like the discovery of dozens of soiled diapers in the tool shed. For the most part, the Visit is not visually remarkable although there is a nice shot near the ending of an epileptic grandma enveloped in a bed sheet like the ghost she becomes. At least the camcorder style of photography is coherent. Shyamalan pulls off a clever (though not extraordinary twist) to kick off the third act, but the last couple of scenes are a bit over the top. I'd recommend it as a good pick for a date movie on Halloween night."
" Visitation rights revoked
",0.0,-0.9861,2017-06-05 00:00:00,4,"I'll pretty much watch any old horror film. It's a definite fault in mine. So I sat down to watch 'The Visit' based on the fact that it was new and looked a bit spooky, judging by the front cover (yes, I do know the old saying about never judging a book by its cover, but I still do!). Now, apart from knowing that it was a horror movie, I learned two other majorly important facts in the opening couple of scenes. The first of which that it was partly made by M Night Shyamalan and, if you don't know, made those classic films 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' around the year 2000. And, since then, his film-making record has been a little patchy (to put it politely!). Secondly, this is a 'found footage' film. And, if you don't know what that is then you obviously don't watch enough modern horror.'The Visit' is about a couple of kids who go to meet their grandparents for the first time (you'll soon find out why they've only just discovered their relatives during their early teenage years, but, ultimately, exposition doesn't matter much). And this is where the 'found footage' element comes in, for the teenage girl feels the need to document the whole experience on her camera, hence the following ninety minutes are relayed entirely through the – shaky – camera-work of a teenage girl. Again, there's a minimal explanation as to why she should feel the need to do this, but, rest assured, as annoying as this would be in real life, no one in the film seems bothered about being filmed a hundred per cent of the time. So, they meet their grandparents and strange things start to happen.Sadly, strange (or rather/interesting/horrific) things don't happen quick enough. If ever a film seemed to drag out its first half then it was here. Yes, I know that it's a little cheap to jump right into a massive bloodbath in the opening scene and a slow burner like this is supposed to build tension and get to know the characters. Yet, the two kids are just not that interesting and you can see the 'threat' coming a mile off. By the time anything remotely interesting happens the film is practically over and you've been checking out Facebook on your smartphone a dozen times while this film has been slowly cranking itself up.Ultimately, it's just yet another run-of-the-mill horror films which clutter up the pool of a thousand other recent found footage films out there. Once again, M. Night Shyamalan does nothing to recapture his former greatness and, although I believe he still has another decent movie or two in him somewhere, this goes no way to prove that. Avoid. You'll have seen better and, if you haven't – again – you obviously don't watch enough horror."
" Definitely not his worst. Also not his best.
",0.3871,-0.2917,2017-05-31 00:00:00,5,"There are people out there that say this movie redeemed M. Night. There are others out there that say this film was the cinematic equivalent of telling off his detractors. Lets be real- it's just a movie. Like any other movies, it has its highs and lows.The high points of this movie make for some decent horror moments. Well done jump scares (I'm normally not a fan of jump scares so consider this high praise). Solid camera-work, which surprised me. Good tension-building moments. Decent pacing, mostly. A decent payoff at the end of the major conflict, though one that does comes with some issues.The low points really left me scratching my head at times. The quirks of the children- the daughter being a documentarian giving much of the film a found-footage style, and the son being a rapper are ridiculous and painful, respectively. The twist ranks among the laziest of horror clichés. The tension turns sour in the end when it takes forever for the kids to do anything in the name of self-preservation once they know what's going on. What few supporting cast members we get range from useless to annoying, there to drop unsubtle hints about the twist, to mug for the documentary camera, or to encourage the son to rap. Lastly, the film could've ended several minutes earlier, but instead subjected us to scenes of a cliché family drama story, and more of the son trying to be a rapper.Overall, I recommend seeing this movie once. There are some genuinely well put together scenes and scares. There's some well-done film-making that does remind me of M. Night's early works. Just realize, you're going to have to put up with some glaring flaws as well."
" Projectile Vomiting Never Seemed So Creepy....
",0.0,0.9748,2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Just caught my fifth film by writer/producer/director M. Night Shyamalan, 2015's ""The Visit,"" which I enjoyed infinitely more than last week's ""Lady in the Water."" In this one, two young kids, a 15-year-old girl and her 13-year-old brother, go to visit their grandparents in the Pennsylvania farm country. This is the first time that they are meeting the grandparents, with whom their own mom (Kathryn Hahn) had had a falling out many years before, and the young girl plans to document the entire visit with her video cameras. Thus, the entire film is of that curious horror category known as the ""found footage"" subgenre, and the director here uses it to chilling effect. The kids find that their grandfolks are quite the decided oddballs, indeed; as a matter of fact, the grandmother suffers from the condition known as ""sundowning"" (Shyamalan's original title for the film), during which she goes absolutely nuts when the sun goes down. And that is just the beginning of what turns out to be a most hellacious visit for these two kids. Shyamalan manages to insert one doozy of a third-act plot twist into this film, one that surely did catch me by surprise. All four of the relatively unknown actors here (Olivia De Jonge, who is remarkably pretty, and Ed Oxenbould as the kids, and Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie as the dotty grandparents) give wonderful performances, and there are any number of scenes guaranteed to send the ice water coursing down the viewer's spine. Most definitely a winner for this very interesting director. Loved it!"
" This Is Just Damn GOOD!
",0.3016,0.9803,2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Is this a classic movie that will be cherished decades from now? Probably not. Will it be as iconic as ""The Sixth Sense"" has been for the past 15 or 20 years. Probably not.But is it a smart, interesting, entertaining movie? Hell, yes!!!The tension builds slowly - and of course, the viewer knows that something bad is going to happen (or there would be no movie). Even so, the tension is handled masterfully.I don't get creeped out that easily, but there were several parts of this movie that definitely creeped me out. And it was done without blood or gore.I loved the performances! The two kids... they made it look easy. But if you really watch, you may see that there was true acting skill behind those performances. The facial expressions... the delivery - spot on!Nana and Pop Pop were totally bad-ass! So kind... sweet... genuine... and genuinely weird.""Found Footage"" movies may have mostly worn out their welcome. But this one is done right, and very creatively.I had given up on M. Night. But he definitely redeemed himself here."
" The big bad wolves
",-0.5423,-0.8457,2017-04-24 00:00:00,5,"M Night Shymalan goes back to basics with a low budget feature so he can wrest creative control from the big studios.The Visit is really a modern twisted fairy-tale with dark humour but like many Shymalan films the pace is deliberately slow with the movie only hitting its stride once the twist is revealed.Two teenaged siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) are sent by their mother (Kathryn Hahn) to stay with their grandparents for a week. They have never met their grandparents before and kids plan to film a documentary about their visit.The mother reveals that she has not spoken to their grandparents for years as they disapproved of getting married to their father.The grandparents Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie), live in a remote farmhouse and tell Becca and Tyler of certain rules. Never go into the basement because it contains toxic mould and bedtime is at 9:30 pm after which they should not leave the bedroom.During the course of their stay Becca and Tyler notice their grandparents displaying strange and even frightening behaviour which leads them to Skype their mum and pleading that she picks them up.The film has a found footage element as the kids film their encounter but despite good acting from the young actors the pacing was just too slow rendering the film dull. The twist might be obvious to some but at least it leads to the children being genuinely in peril."
" I am possibly suicidal from wasting 1.5 hours on this trash

Anyone in their right mind, especially if they knew the elderly folk were impostors, not use literally every opportunity possible to kill them or run away? The movie uses terrible pseudo jump scares that are so predictable, you can't help but laugh at the attempt itself. Anyone who was in the production of this movie should be ashamed of their selves because they, just like old gramps with the shitty pants, rubbed this dirty diaper on the audiences face for ""half an hour""."

That said, there are a few good scary moments, and a decent plot twist, considering there isn't much of a plot in the first place. The most major thing that annoyed me is the flippy, bouncy camera work. Most of us have seen Paranormal Activity, and in my mind this movie is nothing but a bigger budget version of that film. Only PA had me sitting on the edge of my seat all the way through, while Visit only had 3 or 4 moments like that. Acting was bad. Characters are not likable. Lots of errors. One that stuck out for me was one minute there's a foot of snow on the ground, the next there is none. I hate when I feel like I wasted my time watching a movie, and Visit did just that. 3/10 stars."
" Garbage but recorded
",0.0,-0.8543,2017-03-28 00:00:00,3,"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Enough for me to log onto my old IMDb acct and write my first review. I understand the reason why the film was made. It was cheap to make and had a big name behind it. Sadly this seems like the only reason why this film was made. It is actually surprising to me that this movie didn't receive Razzie nom for worst Picture but I've go into that more in detail.The characters are unlikeable. The kids are irritating and annoying from start to finish with dialogue that will constantly remind you that an adult wrote them. Obviously, it's the case but where is that sense of illusion? Besides being cheesy, the dialogue and banter between Becca and her brother seems forced and unnatural. Becca in the film is into the whole mis en scene when it comes to her ""documentary,"" and don't worry because it will constantly be thrown in your face that this is what defines her. The found footage style had a reason but again, it's one of those scenarios where characters are gonna keep recording despite the situation. It kept taking me out of it, this and the cheesy jump scares and the cringy dialogue that went with it. (Trying not to spoil anything) Honestly, look elsewhere if you want to see a good movie. There's so much better stuff out there and sadly, I don't believe Shyamalan is back. I could go more into detail and I should but I honestly didn't care enough to continue writing this review for a movie I despised."

" Avoid This Movie As If Your Life Depended On It!
",-0.3595,-0.9948,2017-03-08 00:00:00,1,"Personal to M Night Shyamalan: I just agonized through The Visit. You truly need to retire from making movies. I have no idea who in Hollywood owes you but they blindly keep handing you money to make cinematic sewage. I just wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I can honestly say that I have never been so angry at the end of a ""movie"" as this one. Absolute cinematic garbage. Kids talking endlessly about nothing. Old people acting stupid and creepy for no reason that makes any sense. Not one redeeming or entertaining moment in the entire movie. Gross crap filled diapers? Thats entertainment? Man you are one sick and arrogant piece of work and then I take time to look at the behind the scenes footage of you and your minions arrogantly boasting about how fabulous your ""art"" is and how great this movie will be. Omg! People Run As If Hell Itself Is Chasing You!. Do Not watch this garbage. 80 percent is shot shaky cam style by children which is pathetic enough but there is absolutely nothing of any value whatsoever in the first 30 minutes and what happens next is absolute random stupidity without any sense of logic or entertainment value. The one and only jump scare is empty and fake. Pathetic! You have been bragged on way too long for the stuff you did two decades ago. I am now convinced that anything good that comes from you then or now is purely by random accident. It's time to hang it up and return to being a grip or some other minion job working for a real director. Look at the track record of Cameron or Spielberg or the amazing elegance of movies directed by Lasse Hallstrom. You are not fit to shine their shoes. You have ridden on the 6th Sense far too long and need to retire back into the obscurity where you belong. What you did with The Visit is criminal. I will never spend a penny on your garbage again and will warn others to avoid you at all cost. Retire dude. You are not a director."
" Horror & Humor: An Odd Combination
",-0.5994,0.9199,2017-03-01 00:00:00,5,"""The Visit"" is easily one of the strangest movies I've ever watched. The reason? Think about this: When has a truly great horror movie ever made you laugh at the same time?For a basic plot summary, ""The Visit"" sees children Becca (Olivia DeJonge) & Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) visiting their grandparents, Nana (Deanna Dunagan) & Pop-Pop (Peter McRobbie) for a week, having no previous contact with them due to a dispute with the children's mother (Kathryn Hahn) long ago. When the siblings arrive on the old farmstead, however, they discover that Nana & Pop-Pop's behavior is erratic (at best) and downright terrifying (at worst).Clearly, ""The Visit"" advertises itself as a horror flick and that is the genre it most wants to identify with. However, when I think back on some of the best horror movies I can recall (Halloween, Saw, The Ring, etc.), one common denominator is that none of them contain any humor. That is where M. Night Shyamalan tries to shake things up...but with very mixed results. In between the scenes of the grandparents getting progressively stranger and stranger, the two kids are hamming it up the whole time and playing for laughs. To me, that really kept killing the tone of the film, as I never felt it sustained enough scary tension at prolonged intervals.Of course, being a Shyamalan production, it does contain a twist ending that will legitimately throw you for a loop. Just like in some of his previous films (like ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable""), a number of clues are in place for the perceptive viewer to maybe start piecing things together. Actually, though, where M. Night shines the most in this one is picking great child actors and getting wonderful performances out of them. There are times when their actions and situations can and will produce genuine laughter. Again, though, does that laughter have a place in a movie meant to be scary?Overall, ""The Visit"" is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. It goes for scares...but ends up delivering just as many (if not more) laughs. I saw it in a theater filled with young teens, and they seemed to love it. Perhaps that was the intended audience all along...the tone of the film just makes it so difficult to figure out. Those who like to invest a bit more thought or want to see a bit more sustained tension, however, will likely be disappointed."

I wanted to kill him myself, and kept hoping he would be the casualty. I am glad I saw this on a friend's basic cable - I would be asking for my money back (even from my cable company) if i had paid for the experience."
" Refreshing
",0.0,0.6335,2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"It's so refreshing to see an original horror come out of Hollywood these days. The film starts in a light-hearted fashion and we are introduced to 2 kids (with a very advanced vocabulary and film- making knowledge for their ages!) who are sent on a trip to visit their grandparents who live on a remote farm in Pennsylvania. Strange events ensue and the fear factor is heightened when we realise the grandmother has a condition termed 'sundowning' which makes her develop some rather strange nocturnal habits. This film doesn't actually show you anything that scary, it's more the sense of what's coming and the underlying reason for the strange behaviour. The twist towards the end is very effective and makes you feel true fear for these kids who go from annoying to likable as the film progresses. The film jumps between horror and comedy to a great effect and I found myself going from laughing to covering my eyes just seconds apart. The acting is top quality and the use of relatively unknown actors is very effective. This feels like a sub- horror genre unto itself and I hope to see more like this from M. Night Shamalan (whose films I usually find rather hit and miss)."

Like many other of his works, of course The Visit has a twist in it, but just the whole thing didn't tie together as nicely as some of his other movies like The Sixth Sense or Signs. The film crosses some boundaries that definitely shouldn't have even been treaded near, and it was just of bad quality. Could the kids and mother have been any more stereotypical? THE VISIT ~Chie~"
" The odd and creepy, the very odd and creepy and 'The Visit'
",-0.5574,0.9946,2017-02-01 00:00:00,5,"M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.The good news is that his latest film, 'The Visit' is Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village', which mostly was a decent film let down badly by the twist. However, judging from what had been said to me prior to watching, expectations were to see Shyamalan making a return to form. Instead, 'The Visit' was a film that is certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes, due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor), it is worth visiting and about mid-spectrum Shyamlan along with 'The Village' and 'Signs' but not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense'.Starting with the good things, 'The Visit' does boast a mostly deft mix of chilling tension, genuine scares that really unsettle you and wonderfully weird comedy. The performances are very good. Not since 'The Sixth Sense' has there been more natural and compellingly real child performances in a Shyamalan film (in this regard he has also varied, achieving brilliance with Haley Joel Osment in 'The Sixth Sense' but also abominable depths with Jaden Smith in 'After Earth'), Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould do a truly great job here. Even better are Peter McRobbie and particularly Deanna Dunagan, chilling as the grandparents.Production design, lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere. The story is mostly deliberate but with enough to absorb because the creepiness is so effective often. The use of music doesn't jar at least and Shyamalan does more than capably building up and on the scares and tension.On the other hand, the twist is not that hard to guess (and to me guessable early on) and not only is the execution of it contrived but it is revealed too prematurely which does affect some of the momentum of the last 30 minutes. Shymalan's films, even his bad films, mostly have good production values to their merit, but the cinematography in 'The Visit' looks cheap, almost amateurish. It adheres to the self-filmed documentary-like style but the excessive shakiness of the camera does exhaust, irritate and nauseate the viewer.While delivering on the atmosphere and enough of the story, the script is sloppy at best and often toe-curlingly weak. There is a lot of forced melodrama, frustrating character decisions and inconsistencies (the mother), overexposed, irritating and quite frankly often pointless and out of place rapping and the children talking like wannabe university students (am aware that there are children in existence who act and speak beyond their years, speaking as one myself a decade ago but not in this awkward-sounding a manner).On the whole, worthwhile and not a bad film but not the return to form that was expected. This said mid-quality-spectrum Shyamalan is infinitely more preferable to the four awful films that he directed before it post-'The Village'. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

But for me - it was utterly ruined by the protagonists.Now i do not care much for kids in movie roles. More often than not they are not only useless as plot devices but also annoying. These two kids occupy the most annoying space possible. The boy is rapping (cringe) and the girl is determined to produce a documentary - and seems never to let go of the camera - even when fighting for her life (admirable indeed).The grandparents are quite mad ... not in a subtle way... no! - they act as crazy as it gets before being classified as possessed by demons. (but that would be a different movie then)The Shyamalan trademark twist is probably a huge shock for the protagonists - but was hardly one for me as a viewer. Although i did not expect it - i simply did not care. What bothered me most was the unnatural dialogue, the actions and reactions between the grandparents and the children. It never felt genuine - or ""how a real person would do it"". Also the pacing in the 2nd act was rather slow. There was hardly any plot development and it got quite boring. However - i would still give it a 4/10 - because i think the story itself had potential. In my opinion - it should have been a whole lot more subtle with much more likable protagonists."

Becca and Tyler have never met their grandparents, their mother left that family home in acrimonious circumstances. Now the kids are off to spend a few days with them - and get far more than they bargained for. If you ask some people then they will say that Shyamalan never had form to begin with, so to them this doesn't warrant being called some sort of return to form, what it does do is find him on sound footings. Veering away from big budgets and adopting a low-fi approach, this very much has him back in the spooky zone. It's all very nutty of course, the premise and the (very good) reveal are hardly genre defining, but the unease is palpable, the mystery element strong and there's a bunch of genuinely freaky scenes. The last third is almost delirious as the story goes through its bad dream fairy tale throes, and the small cast are excellent, with Syamalan once again showing how good he works with young actors. A good honest chiller that isn't purporting to be anything other than that. 7/10"
" Tongue in cheek, but pretty spooky, liked it
",0.8402,0.9969,2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"I'm not a Shyamalan hater, but rather like his movies. He has made hits, misses and some in between, but I think he is a smart and talented movie maker. The Village is probably my favorite of his movies, against the public opinion, and I didn't think After Earth was that bad either. Last Airbender I haven't seen. I was actually quite thrilled to run into a new Shyamalan movie - a horror one - without any prior knowledge of it. I immediately pressed play without reading any reviews. I knew reading reviews on a Shyamalan movie is not a wise thing to do. I'm not gonna spoil much, but there is a twist in this movie too and it works quite well. I'm not gonna write much of the plot here, see it yourself for best experience!I have to admit I was a bit cautious at first, wasn't sure about the possible ""lost footage"" setup and the rapping kid made me worry a little. The movie takes surprisingly long to kick off, but once the grandparents start acting a bit weird, I was totally hooked. The movie has a quirky feel to it, it's almost a horror comedy, but not quite. The scary parts are slightly over the top with a bit of comic touch, but they are very well made and I felt the movie was quite perfectly balanced with lightness and scariness. A few times I noticed myself smiling just waiting what was going to happen next, it's great fun. The acting is great here, all unknown actors to me, even the rapping kid was good in his role. Wouldn't be surprised to see him in the future. His older sister wasn't quite as much of a character, but she did her role quite well. The grandparents were perfect. Even the documentary aspect was done quite well, I did try to watch for camera ""errors"", but I didn't find anything too distracting and even forgot the cameras quite a few times.Happy to see such a fresh and indie style, down to earth ""small"" movie from Shyamalan, I'm pretty sure they had a great time doing this."
" Okay, let's start at the end.
",0.2263,-0.6764,2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"The grandparents are not really the grandparents. They're escaped nutcases from the local asylum that the REAL and murdered grandparents volunteered at.Now we find this out because the little boy stuck the camera, bouncing around, out the closed window and the mom saw the couple in the distance. Okay? Nevermind that the picture the camera was sending was very poor (as evidenced by the kids in the corner of the screen) and damaged earlier.Mom then tries to dial the local sheriff in that town, which she apparently knows by heart. But, of course, to no avail! She then is going to take the several hour trip by car to rescue her children, all the while trying to reach that very sheriff on the phone.Does she tell her kids to call 911 from the house itself? Nope! She does not. Do these very smart kids find a way to use the telephone or the computer to signal for help? Nope! Although very digital savvy (and plenty of Wi-Fi), I don't recall a single cell phone.But let us now go to the beginning. Estranged daughter agrees to send her kids to their grandparents house for the week. All during this there is no request by the mom or the kids for any picture(s) of the said grandparents? None at all? They're kids in a digital age AND interested in video and it doesn't come to mind?Of course not or there would not be any movie. But I digress.So the kids are at the farm and we enter the redundancy of a series of bizarre events that is a-typical of this sort of movie. A whole hour of this nonsense.Let me especially pick out the actions and physicality of the fake grandma. What I'm seeing are things that an elderly woman like her just cannot do. So I'm lead to believe there is some sort of paranormal element at work. But of course that isn't true.In this redundancy is mixed the broken family element, which really goes nowhere. In this, though, were some very good moments with the two kids. The young actors were actually very good but extremely pretentious. Far too smart for their years.Another element that farted out was the fake grandma's wanderings with the hidden camera. In her delirium she finds the camera, carries it to the kids' door and has a knife. All the while putting it in just the right position and returning it to just the right position. I know this was ""found footage"" movie, but the mechanics of doing that were just crushingly obvious.Okay, so we're back at the final battle, where we juggle cameras that all end up, conveniently, in the right place at the right time.A previous scene establishes that the little boy froze once in a football game years ago. Apparently this is now the time to freeze in front of crazy fake grampa (who knows nothing of that previous incident), otherwise the scene didn't work. And the diaper element was just plain disgusting.So we have about two minutes of fighting, grab the camera and reunite JUST IN TIME for the arrival of the cops and mommy. All the while holding the heavy camera in just the right position.Although balancing silly and stupid, there were some redeeming factors. The elderly couple were actually very good in the roles. The element of the elderly being the bad guys was very original.What was also lacking, though, was Shyamalan's directing. Except for Sixth Sense, all of his films have gloriously failed in total. (And apparently the ones I have not seen.) But I've always thought his directing was very good. He just should not be able to write anymore. But even here the directing was poor.But it did well for the $5 million budget. (Although I'm baffled what cost more than $500,000.) And that's what the movie business is all about."
" Not great but definitely entertaining. (no spoilers)
",-0.0475,0.7394,2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"I've quit on Shyamalan's movies years ago and never looked back, a friend whose tastes I respect insisted and I gave this a chance. Glad I did.M Night still has the skill for creating chilling sequences that rely only on his actors and clever framing, there's stuff here on par with his best work, even a twist, his scripts however are the weakest link and this is no exception, there's a certain scene where one character does something so stupid and unnecessary that nearly ruined the film's climax.Also, this is found footage, a sub genre that is love it or hate it for some people, the kids document everything and the film is made from pieces of this footage, they are constantly breaking the fourth wall speaking to the camera and holding it in their hands. The film looks professional enough though, nothing too blurred and shaky so if you get motion sickened easily there's a hope this won't make you puke.If you're like me and lost interest in M Night's stuff but loves horror, give this one a chance."
