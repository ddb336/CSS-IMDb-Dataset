" Unimaginitive And Banal Film
",0.0,0.6951,2021-04-04 00:00:00,4,"I could probably count on one hand the number of scenes in this film that I didn't expect to see and weren't cliched. It's like someone made a film using scenes from other films and edited them all together. This generic feel is most evident when it tries to be emotional and moving; utilizing soft piano notes and slow movements to try and send home the message. Juxtaposed to that is the hectic, hand held style cinematography that does nothing but frustrate.Very little of Anthropoid is actually unique to it. Most aspects of it are well trodden ground and it is a rather banal film."
" [8.2] The Operation that changed Allied's view on Czechoslovakia
",0.0,-0.9762,2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,"A movie that is well-developed, shocking and delivers quite good, aside the weak portrayal of the moments leading and into Heydrich assassination (as most reviewers know, he later died in a hospital of his injuries). The main problem is that almost no injury is seen on screen and that ""anti-char"" bomb would have made much more damage to the car and its occupants. In reality, Heydrich suffered many injuries to his body that he later died of. Nothing of that sort is shown, which is a big weakness by itself.The movie leans more on the parachutists as persons (awesome acting by the cast by the way) and the development of their story and plans, which I understand and respect. That was well-made and the church (6-hours) siege is very well-shown, distressing and much realistic. In fact almost all fights and gun-fights are superbly depicted. The two-hours fly by and you are left with the sensation that more aftermath could have been told and depicted, begging for a longer runtime.Many users have already written detailed reviews and mostly beautifully; that's why I won't repeat what has already been said and delve in deeper.A movie worth watching, as well as reading the real story behind it.I would also recommend watching ""The Man with The Iron Heart"", another movie on the subject."
" English isn't their native language
",0.0,0.8762,2021-01-27 00:00:00,4,"If they've made the movie with that topic where they speak Czech or Slovak(not the same, but both are native languages in that territory) it would be acceptable, but like this?! It is beneath one's dignity."
" The movie is excellent
",0.5719,0.6801,2021-01-15 00:00:00,8,"What attracted me the most was the actor, especially after he represented Becky Blander Khorafi, I highly recommend you to follow"
" Operation Anthropoid
",0.0,0.9422,2021-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Anthropoid builds somewhat slowly, just stick with it and let that time period of the early 1940s sink into you; get to know the characters and feel the gravity of what they're trying to pull off, because it's a true story--and the simple fact that it actually happened makes the film's crescendo utterly devastating--while also sparking a sense of boldness and glory in the heart. The art direction for that era is quite beautiful too; and hey, it's Cillian Murphy, he's always good."
" Wow! Great under-the-radar movie
",0.8478,0.9582,2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I am a big fan of WWI/WWII movies. This one ticked all the boxes!!! The actors were convincing, the story is very important, and it wasn't overdone with Hollywood-isms. I can't speak to the factuality of the film, but others have mentioned it stayed close to the facts. It is a bit dark and definitely emotional, but those were the realities of the war.Really great movie! Definitely add this to your watch list!"
" Watchable, but with many flaws
",0.0,-0.8946,2020-12-25 00:00:00,4,"This film suffers badly from weak script and direction. It also seems to be on a tight budget. Both main characters are unconvincing as people sent to do such an important mission. You would expect them to be well trained professionals carefully selected among many from special forces. However film starts with one of them unable to shoot a man a few meters away due to his hands trembling. This then happens several times. The film completely lacks menacing atmosphere of occupied city. I saw once (former Yugoslav) tv series ""Nepokoreni Grad"" (Unbowed/Unconquered City) about occupied Zagreb where nazi occupation is shown realistically, where fear is palpable, members of the resistance are constantly under pressure. Here in this film, we don't see Nazi atrocities at all. Main characters are relaxed, so much that immediately upon arrival they start not one but two romances. During such an important mission??? A lot of time in the film is wasted on these romantic subplots which are completely irrelevant and destroy the pacing. We are not shown preparations for the assassination in full detail nor German countermeasures since so much time is wasted on trying to force Hollywood style melodrama there where it could not exist. There are many historic inaccuracies, final shootout is over the top (they got only pistols in the church not automatic weapons-they could not kill so many Germans). Main characters made too many mistakes endangering everyone around themselves. They are not very secretive about their mission, if one of them did not contact the boy in the church he couldn't have told tell Germans where they were under torture etc. A missed opportunity. It is not a bad film but it could have been much better."
" Excellent and it's TRUE!
",0.8188,0.1776,2020-12-13 00:00:00,9,"I watch WWII films as most of them are Hollywood over done pancakes. This however is well written, acted and factual. I've visited the east block many times due to my personal interest in WWII and the horrendous vile Nazi war machine. I've walked the streets, been in the Church and meet the beautiful Czech people. It's a hard watch at times but history like this must never be forgotten."

" Good remake of a desperate struggle
",-0.1779,0.0772,2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Another good true film.Like the 70s film operation daybreak tells

" Two great leads
",0.6249,-0.9569,2020-09-15 00:00:00,7,"This film is based on the extraordinary true story of Operation Anthropoid, the WWII mission to assassinate SS General Reinhard Heydrich, the main architect behind the Final Solution and the Reich's third in command after Hitler and Himmler.I have to admit my ignorance and say that I has no idea of this story . When we see films about WWII they tend to be about Americans and to a lesser extent the British . I had no idea what went on in Czechoslovakia - Now I do.This is a well acted , informative movie that starts off as a slow burner then the longer the film goes on the more the tension gets ramped up .
The two leads are an Irishman - Cillian Murphy and a Northern Irishman - Jamie Dornan and both work extremely well together . They are thoroughly convincing as Czech assassins.The last half an hour is quite brutal . What the Germans did to the families that hid these men was horrific and Director Sean Ellis doesn't shy away from showing us in detail.The one question I asked myself after watching this is - was it really worth killing Heydrich ? Sure he was an evil man but the consequences of his death were horrendous for the Czechoslovakian people ."
" Heartbreaking, Gut Wrenching
",-0.4588,-0.5853,2020-09-08 00:00:00,10,"It is hard to imagine how difficult it must have been to reenact the horrifying scenes of Nazi brutality and resistance courage, but this is truly one of the most gut-wrenching and heartbreaking accounts of World War II bravery ever filmed. Whatever way the historical record may differ from this dramatization serves only to validate and honor the spirit of those who resisted the evil that overtook Europe in the 20th century."
" Generous rating out of respect to a true story
",0.8481,0.9343,2020-08-29 00:00:00,5,"Had something for a good project, but I can see why it has been ""hidden""/little known movie. Being a true story, the facts could have written the movie with all the plot requirements. Instead the pacing throughs it off. The fill gets a bit much (story real starts about 55 minutes into it. The characters are not an asch that captures the audience. Rather a bit repealing. And how much is true?
The equivalent to SAS operatives. ""spies"" in espionage, would have been picked for the mission. So... really? A bunch of novices? Is that the real lot? These are spies that parachute into country, get set-up, on confederate escapes and 2nd spy stands there. Then runs out, and ... has trouble wanting to shoot ; better to get turned into SS I guess. Spies that go about in open, knock over a set of chairs in secret room when Germans walk in, can't decide on a mission, and one marries whilst hanging around for the couple of weeks they are there. Really? Wow. A part from feeling like it was a reunion for British/BBC actors (the usual group in different TV series). it was... amature. Too bad."
" Brilliant makeup on Bill Milner.

" Surprise movie of the year
",0.2732,0.9714,2020-04-22 00:00:00,9,"I started watching Anthropoid not really connecting with the narrative due to the darkness and mumbled dialogue and not having any previous knowledge of the history. After the first scene I looked up the movie for an explanation of what I'd just watched. Having got the gist of it and then knowing this really happened I started to take more interest. I'd only recorded it for the cast, having two of my current favourite actors, Cillian Murphy, now more famous for Peaky Blinders, and Toby Jones. Murphy and Jamie Dornan play two exiled Czech resistance fighters, parachuted back into their country to assassinate a member of the Nazi high command Reinhard Heydrich, who had taken over Czechoslovakia and had also been the mastermind behind the so called Final Solution, to eliminate the Jews. From the moment Murphy and Dornan make contact with the underground movement and reveal their mission, the film suddenly grabbed my interest more. It is a slow start and so many films are disappointing because they start this way and fail to build any excitement. Not so Anthropoid. We get to know and care about the characters first before the fireworks start. About halfway through, the attempt on our villain's life takes place giving the film it's first boost of energy and gradually more and more scene grabbing moments occur. It gets very violent and very emotional leading up to a tremendously exciting six hour stand by the resistance in a church which I thought had reminiscences of The Alamo, rather like the last stand of Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie if you're familiar with that slice of history. In the end Anthropoid just blew me away so it just goes to show that if you stick with some seemingly slow movies, you can end up rewarded in spades. I just wish actors didn't whisper their lines so much in contemporary movies or I might have given this ten stars instead of only nine."

" Interesting but a bit dry
",0.2144,0.8422,2020-02-22 00:00:00,7,"1942. German-occupied Czechoslovakia is ruled by the brutal SS General Reinhard Heydrich, the third highest member of the Nazi government. Two Czech exiles are parachuted into Czechoslovakia as part of an operation known as Anthropoid. Their mission: assassinate Heydrich.A reasonably interesting telling of true events. Shows well the preparation of the assassination attempt and the aftermath. If ever you needed a reminder of the atrocities the Nazis committed during WW2, this is it.However, it's a fairly dry telling. There are attempts at character development but these are fairly minor and the engagement factor is not very high. Moves very slowly at times: it's only towards the end that things speed up and we have some good action scenes. Moreover, if you know your WW2 history, much of the intrigue disappears.Overall: worth watching from an educational/historical perspective and for the last few scenes, but not 100% compelling viewing."
" Great movie

" Brilliant

For anyone with a passing knowledge of the assassination of Nazi butcher General Heydrich in Prague during WWII it is painful.

" A true story that one should watch
",0.4215,0.743,2019-07-09 00:00:00,8,"An eye opening account of what went on in Czechoslovakia during the period of Nazi rule. A classic war movie that's tense, tough and gory both physically and emotionally. A superb tribute to the Czech resistance and those that died during this time. A retelling of such a historically prominent story requires the right perspective, right tone and also should capture the emotions right to strike a chord with the audience and thus as a WWII film fan, I truly recommend this movie - this is a great work"
" my notes
",0.0,0.2382,2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,Boring and un-intriguing. A couple cool scenes and some good acting moments but mostly forgettable. Not my kind of movie. (1 viewing)
" Superb
",0.6249,0.5719,2019-06-12 00:00:00,10,"Anthropoid is a seriously complex and stunning drama. The performances by Murphy and Dornan are surprisingly deep and emotional, this one is a must watch."
" Anthropoid
",0.0,-0.9971,2019-05-11 00:00:00,6,"I remember seeing the DVD for this film, I was interested because of the cast, and because of the unusual title, I didn't know what it meant, and when I read more about it, including positive reviews from critics, I was definitely going to give it a try. Basically it is World War II, Slovak soldier Jozef Gabcík (Cillian Murphy) and Czech soldier Jan Kubis (Jamie Dornan) are parachuted into their occupied homeland. They are discovered by two resistance fighters who turn out to be traitors, but despite injuries sustained, the agents manage to steal their truck and head for Prague. Seeking their contact, they are directed to Dr. Eduard (Sean Mahon), who arranges for them to meet other members of the resistance, led by ""Uncle"" Jan Zelenka-Hajsky (Toby Jones). The agents reveal that they are to execute ""Operation Anthropoid,"" the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich (Detlef Bothe), known as the ""Butcher of Prague"", third in command after Hitler and Himmler, and planner of the Holocaust. With limited intelligence and little equipment, Jozef and Jan must find a way to assassinate Heydrich, an operation that, they hope, will change the face of Europe. With the help of two young women, Marie Kovárníková (Charlotte Le Bon) and Lenka Fafková (Anna Geislerová) along with other plotters, the agents plan to ambush Heydrich as he arrives at his headquarters by car. On 27 May 1942, the attack is carried out; it is nearly botched when Jozef's machine gun jams, but Heydrich is wounded by Jan's grenade that shatters his limousine. Immediately after, the assassins go on the run, Lenka is killed trying to escape Nazi soldiers on the street, and resistance fighter Karel Curda (Jirí Simek) turns on the agents. The agents relocate and hide in the Orthodox Cathedral of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague, while Heydrich soon dies from his injuries in the hospital. The family who Jozef and Jan stay with are punished, the mother commits suicide by taking a cyanide tablet, and the son is brutally tortured while being interrogated. The son gives in to the Nazis' demands and tells them where Jozef and Jan are hiding, in the cathedral. Hundreds of Nazi troops storm the cathedral and all the agents are killed in a fierce six-hour battle, a total of 5,000 Czechs and Slovaks were killed in the aftermath of the ""Heydrich Terror"". The assassination of Heydrich was the only successful government organised assassination of a top-ranking Nazi during the war. Also starring Harry Lloyd as Adolf Opálka and Bill Milner as Ata Moravec. Murphy, Dornan and Jones give good performances as the resistance fighters, it is an interesting story about a mission that could make a difference to the war effort, there are many moments that get your attention, and the most memorable sequence is indeed the rousing and explosive finale with all guns blazing, I did drift off what was going on in places, but all in all it is a worthwhile Second World War drama. Good!"
" One of the Best War Movies
",0.0772,0.0644,2019-04-28 00:00:00,9,"There's a line in the movie that goes ""War is not romantic,"" and this pretty much sums up the movie. From the get-go, it's an intense and nerve-wracking movie, with Cillian Murphy providing a standout performance. I would even go so far to say that this is his best movie yet. He plays a stoic man who's on a mission to assasinate the 3rd-highest ranked leader in the Nazi regime and the outcomes of his actions are heartbreaking. In war, there are no winners and this movie clearly shows that. The tension in the movie keeps building until it reaches a crescendo and is drawn out until the last second of the movie. It left my heart racing and my hands shaking, and almost a week later I'm still thinking about this film."
" Cracking, brutal and all true.
",-0.3182,0.8081,2019-04-17 00:00:00,8,"This is an amazing film, on all counts. Great acting, tight script and some rather wonderful costume and set designs. It turned out to be one gripping, yet intelligent watch. just a small couple of points; for me i'd like to have seen more of Heydrich and what went into making him this incredible monster. Also the title is not so inviting but this is just nit-picking really."

Don't hold me to that as a promise though. Tastes are different after all. The acting is really something and the story (based on reality obviously with notes in the credits about real life as with most movies) is really gripping.You may feel that some of the story is heightened and some things feel like coincidences. Now I didn't check all the background so I will not make a judgement on that. But if you can go with the flow and either read up on that later or just plain enjoy this as ""entertainment"" (maybe history lesson is a better description), then go ahead and do that. There is violence obviously and some really crazy things going on ..."

" Bravo Mr. Ellis
",0.0,0.988,2019-02-07 00:00:00,10,"Having seen all three other post-war film versions covering this remarkable true story (Atentat, Operation Daybreak and Man With the Iron Heart), Anthropoid is without any doubt the best of them. Its pace reminded me another great WWII movie, The Great Escape. The first half may seem to be slow, but once the operation starts, it is a thrilling non-stop action. The final shootout unleashed by the Czech agents in the church is pure hell, and in my opinion, it is one of the best shootout scenes made in the entire film history. The movie very credibly expresses the atmosphere in Prague under the nazi occupation, which is underlined by the brilliant soundtrack. Jamie Dornan, Toby Jones and especially Cillian Murphy are acting pretty solid, and all credits to the Czech actors too, namely Alena Mihulova, Ana Geislerova and Pavel Reznicek. Being a Czech, I have also appreciated the accuracy of the movie. All major events of that time are covered in the film as they have really happened.PS As someone wrote before me, if you have seen Anthropoid, you can skip Man With the Iron Heart."
" OPERATION DAYBREAK IS FAR BETTER!
",0.4926,0.8854,2019-02-06 00:00:00,5,"OKish movie. Expected lots, but left feeling blah! by this film. Amazed at reviews that think its the best film ever made on this subject. Firstly, the 1975 film Operation Daybreak is simply far better and much more accurate and truthful than this bit of a mess. If you are of the modern generation who can't bare to watch anything that is past 1990, then The man with the iron heart made in 2017 is a must watch. Still each to their own! Just want to know how Cillian Murphy was able to smoke so many cigarettes when there was a war on. Had the director never heard of rationing? Seriously, if you wish to know how Heydrich was really killed then please watch Operation Daybreak!"

" A movie that stayed with me...
",0.0,0.7995,2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,"I must confess I did not know anything about this story or Czech resistance altogether and can't believe that I missed out on it until now. Although it is such a gruelling story, the atmosphere of the film is beautiful and stayed with me for a while. Sometimes, when a movie's mood sucks me in real bad, I get uncomfortable and want to shake it off - but with this movie it is different, it managed to make me shocked and sad, but at the same time it was so poignant and beautiful that I wanted to stay in that emotional place. I guess that's what you call ""captivating"". The subject is ""heavy weight"", but it doesn't pull you down, like I would have expected.SPOILERS AHEADThe actors deliver great and gripping performances and the ending in the crypt was almost etherial with the floating piano melody, the beams of light, the beautiful shot of Lenka in the water and the quietness. For me it carries the notion that death is just another path, that it is not some dark, horrible place that you have to be afraid of. It was like they all disappeared into light and peacefulness (let's hope they did, and no, I'm not a churchgoing person).
Although all these cruel things happen, it leaves you in a very quiet place, almost like you are suspended in a bittersweet, floating sphere. Sorry, words don't do justice, if you have seen the film, maybe you'll know what I mean.The one thing I could not get used to was the bouncy camera work, it was making me slightly seasick in some scenes. I consciously felt the camerawork as a separate thing."

" STILL DON'T GET THE TITLE...!
",0.0,-0.4659,2018-11-06 00:00:00,6,Czechoslovakia is occupied by the Nazis so a pair of Czech parachutists are dropped into enemy territory to assassinate the lead SS commander in charge to hopefully turn the tide of the occupation. The soldiers played Cillian Murphy & Jamie Dorman are fine in their roles w/one being the committed pragmatist & the other in crisis due to the predicament they've been thrust into. The picture becomes heisty in its center & overly bathed in pathos & predictability in the last 25 minutes or so as the eventuality of their futile mission starts ticking off its victims like so many fallen pieces on a chessboard. Almost there but not quite.
" Chilling movie
",-0.0258,-0.9631,2018-10-03 00:00:00,8,"Most movies for me are over when they end...some linger in the consciousness for longer times...this is one. The bravery of the two Czech commandos is beyond the imagination and so is the brutality of the German SS troops.The lingering question for me is...was the assassination worth the price?Resistance to me suggests; disruption, delay, interference, intelligence gathering, misinformation, etc. At least while the enemy occupies and totally controls the landscape.Active resistance through military-like attacks or direct assassinations of high level leaders brings down such a level of revenge and murder of innocents that it's not worth it.The French resistance only became active as a para-military force when the Allies landed in Normandy and the Germans started to evacuate.Then the only thing on the minds of the SS was escape."
" ""Anthropoid"" recounts brutal history of Nazi atrocities
",-0.6249,-0.9912,2018-09-25 00:00:00,8,"Most students of World War II are familiar with the sadistic career of SS General Reinhard Heydrich, the ""Butcher of Prague."" Even Hitler called him ""cold-hearted."" He was a relentless mass murderer who, among other things, oversaw the Wannsee Conference where he took a lead role in the ""Final Solution"" of the Jews in Europe. ""Anthropoid"" was the operational name for the plan to assassinate him and was engineered by Czech patriots under the supervision of the British. This movie tells the story of that operation and the brutal Nazi reprisals that followed. Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy play the two main assassins who parachute into Czechoslovakia and take up residence in a safe house to plan their attack on Heydrich. They soon found out that the local Czech resistance fighters are not all that keen on the success of such an operation for they have a sickening feeling about what will happen if Heydrich is actually killed. That is, a blood bath of the first magnitude. As it turns out, that's exactly what happens after Heydrich's death as several Czech villages are completely destroyed including the entire population of Lidice. In the end Murphy and Dornan seek refuge in the local Orthodox Church with several other resistance fighters. After a six-hour battle with the Waffen SS, they are all killed (several of the fighters commit suicide rather than be taken alive). The movie shows extreme torture sequences involving the Gestapo obtaining information using all means available. That includes presenting one of their victims the severed head of his own mother in a bucket while they're beating him half to death. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, to put it mildly. Dornan gives a serious performance and is nothing like his ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" character. Murphy, as always, is solid and cast well in his role. Charlotte LeBon does nice work as a Czech patriot who gives Dornan some cover as a girlfriend. Toby Stephens is around as an understated member of the resistance who's forced to take cyanide. According to some credible reports, Heydrich begged forgiveness to God on his deathbed for his crimes against humanity. If he did, it was too little and too late. ""Anthropoid"" was directed by Sean Ellis who deserves a lot of credit for staging the true events depicted in the film."
" Amazing Work
",0.5859,0.8767,2018-09-01 00:00:00,9,"I came upon this movie due research I did after reading about the reprisal massacres in Czechoslovakia in a fiction novel. Like Operation Valkyrie, Operation Anthropoid seems to have been largely underreported in the overarching narratives of World War II in history classes.Most of the first two-thirds of the film is spent on the buildup to the assassination of Heydrich, which then itself sets off a series of action set pieces that any big-budget spy film director would be salivating at.Be it guns jamming at the critical moment, cyanide capsules, suicides, severed heads, or an intense gun battle in a church, it is important to understand that THIS WAS REAL LIFE. Nothing that occurred in the aftermath of the assassination was drawn up for the screen. The betrayal of the assassins, the murders of their accomplices, and their brave standoff with the German, these were all REAL. And in remembering that these things are real, we are able to understand that people like the Nazis exist today. Whether they have learned their cruelty yet or have been put in a position to act upon it is the key, but through this lens, and these exceedingly excellent portrayals by a slew of talented actors, we are reminded that these people actually lived this. This wasn't a work of fiction, this was the reality of war-torn Europe in the 40s.Historical films are at their best when they make us think and feel uncomfortable, and this film accomplishes those tasks with aplomb. The Nazis were monsters, nobody disputes that, but Heydrich was far from the only one, and in ensuring that the aftermath is shown and not glossed over, the filmmakers and writers have helped show just how deep it all ran, and how far down any organization like that can be rooted. Hate and malice are inexorably part of the human condition, but so too are bravery and heroism, and extreme circumstances can create both, even if our modern selves, 70+ years divorced from this war, don't believe it."

" Anthropoid is one of those rare thrillers that actually educates viewers.
",0.0258,0.9883,2018-03-09 00:00:00,7,"The plot is based on the WWII operation to assassinate the Reich's third in command, Reinhard Heydrich. A group of Czechoslovakian soldiers chose to follow orders, a rather commendable action that the film throughly explores. Disregarding their own fates, they chose to do what they believed was the right decision made by government officials in London. They knew the power that Heydrich held in Czechoslovakia and was a valuable asset to the Nazi regime. The beauty of this film, is that I knew nothing about Operation Anthropoid. Having watched this I've taken several pieces of information away therefore proving to be a successful representation of the story. The cast were all pretty good, especially Jamie Dornan who conveyed that vulnerability really well. The legend though, and I use that word with great power, is Cillian Murphy. Possibly one of the most underrated actors working today, he was superb yet again. The more serious and level headed of the pair, he showed emotional conviction and a sense of authority. One thing I did notice was that the forced Czech accents were fading in certain scenes, I'm not the biggest fan of English actors putting on fake European accents. Sean Ellis was a solid director, the final act alone impressed me. Oh and the last five minutes...palpable. Some really beautiful cinematography and was able to capture the tension terrifically. The production design was also fitting, it felt like 1940's Prague and I couldn't tell if any green screen backdrops were used so it looked authentic to me. My biggest negative is the pacing. The first half is so slow and monotonous that I was convinced this was going to go no where. Second half? BOOM! Action, thrills, tension! Perfect for a big screen iteration. The third act is just relentless war...definitely captivating. I also wished the screenplay explored the consequences of the assassination attempt, there was just one scene. Overall though, a slow first half leads to a thrilling second half. Educational and exciting."
" Useless movie
",-0.4215,-0.9915,2018-02-22 00:00:00,3,"If you want to know about Operation Anthropoid, save yourself 2 hours and just go read the Wikipedia entry. What does the movie add to it? Some good acting maybe, a few nice reconstructions of Prague, but that's it. Some random violence (torture scenes), if that's your sort of thing. Not much in terms of good cinematography.Beyond that, you will learn that denizens of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia spoke perfect German for the Germans, whereas the Czechs spoke fluent English with an accent, mixed with a few (usually mispronounced) Czech words (characters are all Czech, whereas some actors are Czech and some English...) Name declensions are sometimes done the Czech way, sometimes not. Characters will comment on other characters' ""lack of German accent"" in speaking said English-with-fake-Czech dialect. Seriously?Even more disturbing is any real depth to the characters' motivations, nor concerns about the whole morality of their actions. Indeed, in the midst of the apex of 20th century's concentration of senseless massacre and utter Evil, does any of the characters or indeed the movie itself offer any insight into what defines that Evil, and how to actually an effectively fight it?(light) SPOILERS BELOW (it's history anyway)Indeed, the whole rationale of the title's namesake mission is unquestioned. When the two main characters arrive and explain it to the resistance, they do offer reasonable doubt regarding the obvious fact that it will only make matters worse and only cause more deaths (indeed that is what happened: retaliation deaths in the thousands, for what?). Their answer? ""We are soldiers and we have our orders."" No one raises the obvious question: isn't this *precisely* the kind of irresponsible and immoral attitude without which a grand total of zero of WWII's 50 million deaths would have been possible? And whence are the orders coming from, mind you? British government (the one responsible for Munich) and the Czechoslovak government-in-exile (the one responsible for accepting Munich and surrendering). So the two governments responsible for turning over not only a whole country (with a large Jewish minority...) over for nazi massacre, but also a country with top-notch military equipment, and one of the most heavily industrialized of the world at that time: both essential for further nazi war effort. Shouldn't maybe further orders, obviously *also* leading to massive deaths, coming from those same governments, be questioned maybe? Or indeed, start wondering about the very problem of entrusting whole nations's destinies into the hands of a few (poorly selected) individuals, and then unquestioningly obeying their orders?This movie offers none of that and is thus utterly useless."

" Tense resistance
",-0.34,0.5336,2018-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Saw 'Anthropoid' as somebody fascinated by the story of the before, during and after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich (a nasty piece of work who really was The Man with the Iron Heart), told from the point of view of the conspirators/assassins.'Anthropoid' takes a little time (a little too much) to gel and get going and some of the shakiness of the camera did feel excessive at times. Anybody watching the film looking for it to be historically accurate will, judging from the comments already made, be in despair. Stick with 'Anthropoid' though, don't be put off by the slow start. When the tension and emotion properly kicks in it is richly rewarding.Excepting some of the camera work, 'Anthropoid' is well made on a visual level. There is a claustrophobic atmosphere evoked that on the most part heightened the urgency levels. There is a real feeling of evocative authenticity, with attractive costumes that captured the era well, elegant interiors and very atmospherically grim landscapes. The music is suitably haunting and Sean Ellis' direction is very strong in the second half, at its very best at the end. The script is thoughtful and doesn't ramble or confuse. The story is gripping on the most part, with the second half in particular having a lot of heart-pulsing tension and emotional power. The ending is brutal, rousing and very moving, will admit to crying. 'Anthropoid' by all means is not an easy watch, then again considering the subject matter nobody should expect it to not be. It pulls no punches and doesn't hold back, making for scenes that are disturbingly harrowing. A great job is done too with making the assassins interesting and rootable. Anybody who knew how nasty a piece of work Heydrich was would find it an easy thing to empathise, those who don't know so much will understand their point of view very quickly without being manipulated to.Very good performances all round, didn't matter at all as to whether it was a starry cast or an all Czech one with subtitles (either would have worked). Cillian Murphy effortlessly provides the heart of the film in understated, stoic fashion. Jamie Dornan is another case of somebody showing that they can act if given the right material. Toby Jones is solid. On the whole, gripping film, although it doesn't get going straight away it is well worth sticking with. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" Uneasy and safe
",0.0772,0.8054,2017-12-25 00:00:00,5,"Really interesting true war stories are now a thing of the past, leaving very few of them still not adapted for the big screen. 
''Anthropoid'' is one of those scripts that tend to look pretty much better on the paper than on the celluloid. Saga about the Czech patriots that find their way back in the occupied Prague via parachute to assassinate the notorious Reinhard Heydrich has all the elements to create a tense and memorable atmosphere, but it doesn't succeed to do so. Instead, British flick, led by the always reliable Cillian Murphy manages to succumb the viewer to its really slow pace and claustrophobic feeling, which is not a bad thing after all. The bad thing is that the much expected climax somehow wiggle its way from us, leaving us with a nausea in the final showdown between the commandos and the Nazi.
''Anthropoid'' is one of those smaller scale productions that were primarily meant for television and blu-ray rather than the big screen."
" Thankfully No Hollywood
",0.1531,0.9904,2017-12-04 00:00:00,7,"Just to be on the safe side I mention that there are spoilers ahead. Although it doesn't take a rocket scientist or an expert researcher to 'find out' how Anthropoid ends, I'm just doing what I figure is best.Americans don't play the heroes and there is no 'Hollywood' ending (ok, end of spoiler alert).Anytime a Nazi gets killed is a good thing (fiction or IRL). Sure, we've seen similar stories in the past (ok, well a lot), and it's almost like there are limitless tales about assassinations or attempted assassinations of top Nazi personnel. But, what I like most about this story is the determination of its protagonists to accomplish their mission – not that they differ from anyone else, but the passion displayed by Cillian Murphy's Josef Gabcik is very inspiring. I am really empathetic to their struggle (and I have Austrian blood in me!) and I feel like I need to help in some way. Like any great soldier these patriots are willing to be killed for the better of humanity and/or their country.I also like that there is no American involvement seen anywhere. There is, however, very little mention of British involvement. The 'real' story is that Operation Anthropoid's operative's, although both Czech and Slovak, were trained by the British. Also, the Czechoslovakian government needed permission from the Brits before carrying out the plan (the Czech government was in exile in London at the time). When I think of Czechoslovakia I certainly don't think of James Bond or Jason Bourne type of planning and 'execution' for the better of the world. I mean really, Czechoslovakia? The home of Pilsner, small cars and a funny language carrying out an assassination of the 3rd most powerful man in the Reich?! WTF. Yes! It works, and quite well.Like the actual story, there are some blunders in the movie, too, but for the most part very enjoyablein part because there is no 'Hollywood' in it."
" This film is huge mis-step, let me explain why
",0.3182,-0.9277,2017-11-26 00:00:00,5,"I feel that this film doesn't do justice to the story of Anthropoid. If you're going to tackle something like this with a reasonable budget, you surely have a responsibility to do it well. My fear is that the generation of people being introduced to the story via this film (which they will do as its stars '50 Shades' Dornan, and Nolan- regular Cillian Murphy) won't understand any of the true depth or complexities of what happened. Great that they get to know about it at all, but it'll often be a case of ""hmm, what next, Stranger Things?"" rather than looking further or realising how much more there was to it. It completely fails to set the context of what was going on in Prague at the time, the atmosphere of oppression with Heydrich's initiatives and the regular executions. Unforgivably, it fails to give any detail or context whatsoever to Heydrich, who this person was, why the Czechs feared him, or how he was instrumental in vast atrocities including the 'final solution'. Having had more context would have framed the story better in terms of how terrifying and important this mission really was. The actors weren't well directed at all - carrying the implication of foreboding via constant frowns and moodiness, whereas in reality the two (Gabcik especially) were more light-hearted and energetic. The director again fakes (unnecessary) tension by making Kubis trembling and panic-stricken - he didn't and wasn't. It doesn't mention how they landed far away from the intended landing point - and how they had to back track all the way to Pilsen to meet their contacts before getting into Prague (a huge inconvenience being that they landed quite near Prague). The HUGE story of what happened to Lidice and other reprisals is glossed over with a few lines of dialogue. Hitler's reaction to Heydrich's assassination, the strict curfew, mass arrests, executions, hundreds of thousands of house searches - so many moments of pure terror and fear that are just missed entirely. Cinematically the story is rich with such moments for raw emotional impact, so its a travesty that the first half of the film is pretty dull, choosing to focus instead on the romance element - in cheesy crowd-pandering fashion. It also looks like a TV movie at best. The ending is appalling - rather than let the situation speak for itself, the director chooses to ram it down your throat with a muted soundtrack, cheesy piano score, and suggesting that Gabcik was fantasising about his dead girlfriend (she didn't die before Gabcik at all). With HHhH (The Man With The Iron Heart) also completely messing this story up, its a shame that there are probably no opportunities left now without it seeming like overkill. The original Czech film Atentat is still the best and most atmospheric version."
" Heroes never die.

The story is about the seven brave men that accomplished this task. From the beginning till the bitter end you can follow the agonizing moments those men lived. The story is well directed, from a relatively slow start to a magnificent ending. The cast was perfect for this movie. All actors gave a great performance.

A warning to some; if you like a movie that at least makes you grin, smile or laugh at least once during the film – this is NOT the movie for you. Anthropoid is a rigid, matter-of-fact, historical-based movie about the perils of war and the nail-biting pressures associated with trying to assassinate someone in an occupied territory. I would put this movie in line with 'Black Mass', regarding its callus subject matter and lack of any joyous moments. However, with all that said, I enjoyed the movie for its frank delivery. No-frills were added to this one, just so they could appeal to everyone. A very good WWII movie about the occupation of Czechoslovakia."
" Their finest hour
",0.0,-0.7398,2017-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Although it takes a while to understand everything that is happening in ""Anthropoid"", the tension builds and builds to a truly stunning climax.The filmmakers have taken a very up close and personal approach to the events and it makes for a powerful experience.Czech agents Jozef Gabcík (Cillian Murphy) and Jan Kubis (Jamie Dorman) are dropped into Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia to assassinate the Nazi governor, Reinhard Heydrich. Although successful they are betrayed. Their associates are uncovered and tortured. Finally the small band of agents is trapped and make a desperate last stand. The film is an epic war movie, but played out in picturesque streets, small apartments and finally in a beautiful old church.Lewis Gilbert of ""Alfie"" fame directed a version of the story in 1975's ""Operation Daybreak"". Like ""Anthropoid"" it was filmed largely where it happened, however it attempted to cover more territory starting with the planning in England. It also gave more screen time to Heydrich.""Anthropoid"" views Heydrich at a distance, much the way he would have been seen by Gabcík and Kubis.Sean Ellis's film digs deep into the characters with Gabcik and Kubis shown overcoming personal fears. The film does not shrink from the brutality of the Nazis; the scenes where the conspirators are captured and tortured are grim, and they herald what would befall the agents if they surrendered. It partly explains why they fought so hard - saving the last bullet for themselves.A documentary on the History Channel, ""Nazi Hunters; Killing Reinhard Heydrich"", posed the question of whether the cost of the assassination to the Czech people was worth it as thousands of men women and children were killed in reprisals.One aspect of the assassination worth considering was Heydrich's potential as number three in the Nazi hierarchy. Hitler loved the guy. Although ruthless (the man with the iron heart) he was brave. He was also intelligent and highly capable. It is thought that Himmler regarded him as a rival and may have denied him medical treatment at the end.If he had not been eliminated, what would Heydrich have been capable of as Hitler began to lose his grip on reality? Heydrich had more guts than Himmler and was more astute than morphine-addicted Goering. Seen in that light, Jozef Gabcík and Jan Kubis may have changed the course of history more than they knew.""Anthropoid"" is beautifully made and the staging of the final battle in Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral is so intense you almost feel the chips of masonry hit you in the face. The filmmakers and the actors seemed inspired by the events they were portraying. They have created something unforgettable."

WEll, there are good and weaker points. Almost all accuracy and cool play are deleted by terribly slow pace and unbearable predictability. Yeah, the assassination scene is awesome as well as the final stand in the cathedral - and main parts are all decent. But no, it could have been shorter, not in this sick sepia color scheme and not so trite in several scenes. And then, there are totally unnecessary symbolic scenes and very languid close-ups that kill all the thrill. Therefore, this is a very uneven movie with both weak and strong points to its merit.

",0.0,-0.9488,2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"During World War 2 , in 1942 Czechoslovakia , SS-General Reinhard Heydrich is appointed by Hitler to become the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia , he is known as ""The Butcher of Prague"". As a squad of Czech expatriates formed by self-exiled Czech and Slovak soldiers (played by Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan) are parachuted into Czechoslovakia in order to assassinate the German governor Reinhard Heydrich , the main architect behind the Final Solution and the Reich's third in command after Hitler and Himmler . The group is assigned a dangerous mission called Operation Anthropoid , to execute a top-secret assignment that would change the face of Europe forever . It was hatched by the Allies after having been prepared by the British Special Operations Executive to eliminate a high-ranking Nazi (it is believed that Admiral Canaris passed crucial information to Allies for organizing the attack) . In Prague , the group is helped by partisans (Charlotte Le Bon , Sean Mahon , Toby Jones) . On 27 May 1942 , Heydrich proceeded on his daily commute from his home to Prague Castle. Gabčík and Kubi waited at the tram stop at a tight curve . The spot was chosen because the curve would force the car to slow down . As Heydrich's open-topped Mercedes-Benz reached the curve , Gabčík stepped in front of the vehicle, trying to open fire, but his Sten gun jammed . Heydrich ordered his driver , SS-Oberscharführer Klein , to stop the car. When Heydrich stood up to try to shoot Gabčík , Kubi threw a modified anti-tank grenade at the vehicle , and its fragments ripped through the car's right-rear fender , embedding shrapnel and fibres from the upholstery into Heydrich's body , even though the grenade failed to enter the car . The assailants initially hid with two Prague families and later took refuge in an Orthodox church dedicated to Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague . The Germans were unable to locate the attackers until Karel Čurda of the ""Out Distance"" sabotage group was arrested by the Gestapo and gave the names of the team's local contacts for a bounty . The assassination of Heydrich was one of the most significant moments in the history of the resistance in Czechoslovakia and is considered to be the strongest act of defiance throughout occupied Europe . The act had such an impact that it led to the immediate dissolution of the Munich Agreement as signed by Great Britain and France , as well as Germany's ally Italy . Britain and France agreed that after the Nazis were defeated the annexed territory (Sudetenland) would be restored to Czechoslovakia. As Heydrich was one of the most important Nazi leaders , two large funeral ceremonies were conducted. The first one was in Prague , where the way to Prague Castle was lined by thousands of SS men with torches . The second was in Berlin attended by all leading Nazi figures , including Hitler, who placed the German Order and Blood Order medals on the funeral pillow . The betrayer Karel Čurda, after attempting suicide, was hanged in 1947 for high treason .Film based on the true story of the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague . It explores the preparations , execution , and aftermath of this operation and the bloody revenge on the Lidice village . Operation Anthropoid shows the operation leading up to Heydrich's death as well as the massive German reprisals that followed it . One of the best things about this interesting film results to be its excellent recreation , shot in Prague with authentic scenarios , we have the full details of the events , the arrival of the command , the plan of attack , the realization of it , the Nazis retaliated with physical elimination of Lidice , and as they surrounded the Church of St. Cyril by the treachery of one of the components of the command . It was played by an magnificent plethora of actors , such as : Jamie Dornan as Jan Kubis , Cillian Murphy as Josef Gabcík , and Charlotte Le Bon , Brian Caspe and Jirí Simek as traitor Karel Curda . Furthermore , a functional and atmospheric cinematography by Sean Ellis himself . And an emotive as well as thrilling Original Music Score by Robin Foster . The motion picture was professionally directed by Sean Ellis . He is a craftsman and expert on all kind of genres . Sean Ellis was born in 1970 in Brighton , Sussex , England . He is a writer and director , especially known for Cashback (2006) , Metro Manila (2013) and Operación Anthropoid (2016).It is based on on a true story that also was adapted by Fritz Lang , in 1943 ¨Hangmen Also Die¨ , ¨Hitler's Madman¨ (1943) and ¨Atentat¨ (1964) and in 2016 and 2017, two versions of the Heydrich assassination were released , ¨Operación Anthropoid¨ (2016) and ¨The man with the iron heart¨ (2017) by Cedric Jiménez with Rosamund Pike , Mia Wasikowska, Jack O'Connell, Jack Reynor , and Jason Clarke as Reinhard Heydrich and Stephen Graham as Himmler ."

Thank you.Beautifully soundscaped, harrowing that you know what's to come. The perversity of the Nazi ideology on display.

I must confess I was little skeptical before seeing the film as I have not very good experience when someone from the west tries to retell history of my country and my people. And, there is of course phenomenal Czechoslovakian movie Assassination from 1964, which depicts the same story and I consider it among the best war films ever made. So there will be many comparing, I was afraid too. But at the end of the movie I knew it was much better than I have expected. The Czechoslovakian movie is still better but the difference is not so big. The only thing I was not contend was that we hardly see Heydrich before assassination attempt, it both softens the tension and viewer who does not know much about him could be confused why and who is to be killed. But there are many good things in the film, among the best Cilian Murphy and Toby Jones, actors par excellence (however depicting of Gabcik is not very accurate, in fact he was very warm and friendly man, not so hardened silent warrior as the one in the film). From the assassination scene it gets better and better and ending is really impressive. Now I only hope that HHhH will not be trash (as it seems to me according to trailers). Binet's work is worth of careful adaptation."

One doesn't often think Czechoslovakia when mentioning WWII, thus this was interesting history to see some of their involvement in fighting back Nazi Germany as they took over their entire country because they lacked a strong military. This movie follows the lives of a few rebels who honorably fight back the Nazi's and how they hatch a plan for the assassination and later the German response to the attempt. While the movie slowly builds the story, it manages to keep intrigue as you are eager to see how things play out and later intensifies immensely. So much so that it feels like a bad and ominous video game scenario. High production value, great sets and solid acting make this yet another quality story told from the horrors of WWII."
" Anthropoid Vs HHhH
",0.0,0.9401,2017-05-07 00:00:00,9,"It's curious that what pushed me to watch ""Anthropoid"" was the fact that I had read the novel HHhH by Laurent Binet relating the same events, and I was waiting impatiently to the movie HHhH (aka ""The Man With The Iron Heart""), when I saw that this one was nearest to be released. I first thought that ""Anthropoid"" should be probably inferior to ""HHhH"" (Don't ask me why, I don't know), and I was not too much motivated to see it. Then I saw, (thanks IMDb), that ""HHhH"" was going late, and ""Anthropoid"" was finally the first to be released. I could not watch it at the cinema, and had to wait to its DVD release. I finally watched this movie yesterday (I have to say that the Blu-Ray release is not too good), and I loved it a lot. This movie is a ""must see"", I recommend it to everyone, and specially to those who are interested on events of the second World war, being this one a very important one. The ambient is very well recreated, the tension and the suspense catch you from the beginning and holds you in its claws until the final moment. The action is very well designed and the performances are very good. What else? Two hours during which you can relive one of the important moments of the resistance during the Second World War.I have only one wish now: that ""HHhH"" is better than ""Anthropoid"" (it shall be difficult!), and that then we will be able to say ""Please, make us more presents as those""."

Reinhard Heydrich, the Steve Bannon of the Hitler Administration. (Heydrich likewise makes secret deals with the Red Commie Russian KGB, as well as rigging elections to get the original Fuhrer installed as President and as TIME Magazine's Man of the Year.) Though Christian finally manages to fire a lucky shot, bringing down Heydrich's Bannon figure, it's TOO LATE to save Anne. That's why Today's Americans MUST take the lessons of ANTHROPOID to heart, as it is based upon a Real Life World War Two Resistance Operation. Every day that the slayings committed by Current Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin's Puppet Rump are allowed to mount from the dozens through the hundreds and beyond, the roots of this Holocaust-in-Progress become more entrenched. As ANTHROPOID proves, once the Putin\Rump Deplorables have rubbed out thousands of us, further Resistance will seem futile, millions will march off the cliff toward Oblivion like lemmings, and only a Nuclear Option will put an end to the Madness. ANTHROPOID encourages viewer groups in the USA to learn from the hard-won experience depicted therein, and act NOW to nip in the bud the RED DAWN KGB infiltrators and their High Treason Traitor Fifth Columnist allies Before It's Too Late!"
" Superb, low key WW2 resistance thriller
",0.5267,0.9771,2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"ANTHROPOID is a Nazi resistance thriller that tells the incredible true story of the attempt by Czech secret agents to assassinate high-ranking Nazi officer Reinhard Heydrich in Prague in the middle of the Second World War. The film was previously shot as OPERATION: DAYBREAK in the 1970s, and this new version sits comfortably amid other resistance thrillers such as VALKYRIE, BLACK BOOK, and MAX MANUS: MAN OF WAR.And what a treat it is to watch. This is a slow burning suspense thriller for the most part, one that stays absolutely focused on telling the main storyline without getting bogged down in romantic sub-plots or the like. It's gripping and intensely realistic, told in a low key way that works nicely. The cast is mainly unknown although such reliables as Cillian Murphy and Toby Jones do well in their parts. Things build to a fine assassination scene and then a set-piece church climax that contains an absolutely superb scene (the balcony siege) which is one of the best I've ever seen in cinema. The whole film is so effective at what it does that I can't wait to see it again."
" Unimpressive film of extraordinary event
",-0.34,0.8382,2017-04-05 00:00:00,6,"Antrophoid tells the story of one the most extraordinary operations of WW2, but somehow makes it feel dull.One of the major problems is that the target of the operation, Heydrich gets basically zero screen time.The truth is that Heydrich is not the most well known figure of the Nazi top leadership. The movie TELLS you he is one of the most atrocious men to have ever lived but it never SHOWS it. This leads to a weaker connection to the events in the film than would have otherwise been. The film even fails to show the ultimate fate of Heydrich, you are once again just briefly told what happens.Instead a large part of the film consists of the main characters telling everyone they meet about their top secret mission. This is accompanied by uninspired discussions about whether the mission is a good idea and an unnecessary romantic subplot. These dragged out scenes together with the omission of interesting aspects make for a badly paced film. This pacing does improve somewhat towards the end of the film The movie is also very historically inaccurate, which is just plain unnecessary when you got such rich source material to draw from."
" I was resistant to see this movie but am so glad that I did
",0.743,0.9378,2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"My husband is fascinated with World War II and Reichsprotector Reinhard Heydrich in particular. One of his favorite movies, and one which he has written about professionally, is 1943's ""Hitler's Madman"" in which John Carradine's Heydrich was a scenery-chewing monster.My husband Greg has often wondered why the movie industry has never presented a film depiction of what really occurred when Heydrich was assassinated. His wish was fulfilled when ""Anthropoid"" was released. Greg's favorite 2016 Christmas present from me was a DVD of the film. This evening I agreed to watch it with him and was very pleasantly surprised.It was difficult to watch. For one thing, I was aware the whole time that much of the movie was real and that, no matter how much I wanted these people to ""live happily ever after,"" that they were all doomed from the very beginning. The strength of the script, the directorial vision, and the acting expertise made me believe the truth of the story and characters and to love the heroes and to hate the villains.Although an overview knowledge of the assassination of Heydrich might be an asset in appreciating this movie, do not hesitate to watch it if you know nothing about the event or its repercussions.My only criticism is that the name of the movie, although historically accurate as the code name of the assassination mission, is confusing to an audience. When I first heard that my husband wanted to see the movie ""Anthropoid,"" I thought it was a science fiction movie!"
" sincere war movie
",-0.296,0.628,2017-03-07 00:00:00,6,"The Allies agreed to the Munich agreement with Hitler who used it to occupy Czechoslovakia. Reinhard Heydrich is the Nazis' third-in-command and considered the main architect of the Final Solution. He takes over the occupation of Czechoslovakia to put down the resistance earning him the name ""The Butcher of Prague"". Jan Kubis (Jamie Dornan) and Josef Gabcík (Cillian Murphy) returns from London under the orders of the exile government to assassinate Heydrich.The actors are top shelf. The story is sincere told in a straight-forward manner. Despite the human drama, there are no surprises or exceptional tension. It is relatively flat even with the dire circumstances. There isn't anything bad about it but it needs some imagination to bring out its inherit drama. There is a compelling conflict about the mission within the resistance. In the end, none of it pulls hard enough. It's a well made movie."
" Unimpressive
",-0.34,-0.5581,2017-02-12 00:00:00,5,"Anthropoid suffers from a lifeless, unfocused script, claustrophobic framing, and desultory direction . What could have been a fascinating account of the assassination of SS Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and the reprisals on the citizens of Czechoslovakia turns into a weak melodrama that does not deliver the elements needed for a satisfying motion picture. Almost nothing was really developed or it was thrust upon the audience without any care or preparation. The material is so rich yet most of it was skimmed over. I don't see why anyone would consider this script good enough to be a major motion picture. I was very disappointed."
" A Moving Historical Piece!

I found the bravery and the almost instant willingness of self-sacrifice exemplified by Jan Kubis and Jozef Gabcik to be quite horrifying, because when upstanding men like them have to do their duty, you're reminded how close the world was to hell back then. I also felt it gave a hardly seen (in film/TV) but memorable glimpse of life under the Nazi Regime in central Europe, which was well appreciated. I'm glad I picked up this film, as it makes me appreciate the freedoms I enjoy in my everyday life and serves as a reminder of what submission to blind totalitarianism looks like: suicide."
" The effects of selfless heroism
",0.5859,-0.9551,2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"Although the emergence of the superhero genre and the re-emergence of the Star Wars franchise as a global phenomenon have turned audience's attentions towards conflict on a more galactic scale, film-makers still find a fascination with World War II and the smaller-scale, almost forgotten acts of heroism that occurred amidst the bloody madness. Whether it be soldiers on the front-line or the chess-playing at the very top, audiences also remain keen, and their frequent presence at the big Awards suggests that there is still a wealth of material to explore. The story of Operation Anthropoid has been told before, but never with such a grasp of the scale of these men's mission, and all the horror and hesitation that comes with it.Sean Ellis' Anthropoid chooses to focus on two men - Josef Gabcik (Cillian Murphy) and Jan Kubis (Jamie Dornan) - from Czechoslovakia's government (now in exile) as they are parachuted back into their homeland during the German occupation. That same night, they are taken in by two fellow freedom fighters who offers them shelter from the harsh weather. They turn out to be betrayers and blood is spilled before Gabcik and Kubis flee to Prague. The stock footage shown on early establishes the context: With Czechoslovakia left without allies following the Munich Agreement, the Nazis quickly invaded. crushing any acts of rebellion with swift executions and routinely torturing suspects for information. Czechoslovakia was a very dangerous place to be in 1939.Our two heroes have arrived in their homeland with one goal - to execute Reinhard Heydrich, the high-ranking Nazi official who masterminded the Final Solution and was dubbed the 'Butcher of Prague'. They touch base with their fellow freedom fighters, who all have a clear picture of the repercussions the country will face should the operation go ahead. This was never an assassination intended the win the war, but to make a global statement of their intent to fight the oppressive threat. It may be for the greater good, but it also means that thousands will die. This conflict is reflected in the two main characters. Gabcik is steely-eyed and determined to follow his orders through no matter what the consequences, while Kubis is the younger romantic, hoping to live long enough to see a better world.Anthropoid is keen to study the effects such selfless heroism can have on a person, and the men many and women taking part in the operation do so with shaky hands, self-doubt and trepidation. Ellis keeps things incredibly reserved and low-key for much of the built- up, perhaps a little too much, but this time is spent enveloping you its paranoid and dangerous world, where a slip of the tongue in the presence of the wrong person could mean torture and brutal death. I must admit that I wasn't familiar with the ins-and-outs of the story before going into the film, so the climactic stand-off against a hail of Nazi bullets and pipe bombs in the Orthodox Cathedral was an exciting and emotional experience. It's all shot with a grainy, brown-y tinge by Ellis, who also acts as cinematographer, and helps to give the film a lived-in feel, avoiding the ugly sheen that plagues many a period piece."

A story, set in Czechoslovakia, I had never heard before about the attempted assassination of the architect of The Final Solution. Brilliantly produced, directed, and acted. A tragic and 'must see' movie. Please see it as it is important that these stories are passed on. Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dorian are excellent, as are the supporting cast members. The pacing is tense and the movie flies by. I don't understand why I had not heard of this movie before as it only came out in 2016. It deserves to reach a wider audience."
" A fitting tribute
",0.0,0.2401,2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"In 2008 I had the pleasure of visiting the Orthodox Church of St. Cyril and Methodius in Prague where the final scenes of Anthropoid are filmed. A well-dressed, elderly, gentleman was waiting for a tour group to arrive to guide them around the church. On learning I was British he asked me to join the group as it mostly comprised American students and so he would be conducting the tour in English. If he had sat down and written a book I would have sat down and immediately read it. He was a Czech Jew who had survived the war in hiding in Prague and so could personally remember many of the events he was describing. At the end of the war, being fluent in several languages, he had been recruited by the US army to serve as an interpreter at the Nuremberg war trials. In that capacity he personally met many of the individuals responsible for the holocaust and the deaths of the people closest to him. He had, remarkably, largely reconciled himself to what had happened during the years of Nazi occupation and the years of Soviet occupation that followed. He bore no grudges against the Western powers for surrendering his country at Munich or to the Germans who occasionally visited the church. His main concern, and the reason he conducted the guided tours, was the lack of interest or awareness among people, and young people in particular, of what had happened during the war and the sacrifices millions made standing against Nazi Germany, often, as in this case, against impossible odds. He may not be alive now but, if he is, I hope he thinks this film is a fitting tribute. I certainly did."
" This is far from a light hearted, no-brainer action romp. It's deep, dark, disturbing, intense and thought-provoking, and it's superb!
",0.3382,0.2581,2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"In May 1942, an assassination attempt was carried out against Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Nazi forces in German-occupied Czechoslovakia and a key architect behind the 'Final Solution' against the Jews. The British and the exiled Czech Government had concocted the assassination plan together, choosing Heydrich as a target due to his position within the Nazi hierarchy, his role within Prague and for his abhorrently brutal actions against civilians. Around 6 months before the assassination attempt was made, two soldiers; Jozef Gabcik and Jan Kubis; parachuted into Czechoslovakia to begin Operation Anthropoid.This is where Anthropoid begins, as the ever-excellent Cillian Murphy (Jozef) and the impressive Jamie Dornan (Jan) have just touched ground, removed their parachutes and set about finding their bearings. We follow Jozef and Jan as they make their way to Prague, searching cautiously for their contacts within the Czech Resistance, before stationing themselves into position in order to plan the assassination.Director Sean Ellis delivers a hugely accomplished effort here, in what is essentially a film of two halves. With the assassination attempt sensibly positioned in the middle of the film, the first half is a slow, steady build-up laden with intricate dialogue as we get to know Jozef and Jan and the supporting players within the Resistance. We learn much of their personalities, and significantly, their motivations. Jozef and Jan in particular are not action heroes ready to fearlessly take on the Nazi army; these are two scared, on-edge and paranoid men clinging onto a belief that what they're about to do is necessary and right.The second half picks up the pace dramatically, as Jozef, Jan and the Resistance deal with the aftermath and the reprisals of their assassination attempt, which ultimately lead to an epic, enthralling, violent and harrowing climax.It's perfectly pitched by Ellis, who controls the pace with great assurance and uses it to mirror the environment and state-of-mind of the protagonists. Indeed, within moments of the start of the film, we see Jozef and Jan fighting for their lives; panic, anxiety, bewilderment and fear etched on their faces. The pace then slows as they set about establishing their position within the Resistance; determination, authority and motivation all conveyed but always with that undertone of paranoia and fear. The pace of the film could almost represent the heartbeats of Jozef and Jan. However, should anyone feel even remotely bored by the slower elements of Anthropoid, they would be wise to stick with it and reap the reward of being thrown into some unbelievable action once Ellis ramps the pace up.By developing such a steady and precise build up, and drawing out the anxiety and fear of his leads so well, Ellis expertly allows for tension to softy bubble under the surface, and times it perfectly to create an explosive boiling point at the necessary moment. Every bullet and explosion is felt and heard by you as the audience (making this a worthwhile trip to the cinema!), flying shrapnel and shards of stone and glass sound as if they're inches away from hitting you, and the relentless gunfire and sense of panic really draws you into the scene to the point that you begin to experience the chaos and anxiety yourself... and that was just the assassination attempt. The finale recreates this ten-fold and further plaudits must therefore be given to Ellis for his ability to depict such intense action and play out such well crafted set-pieces against a backdrop of intricate drama and character development.Naturally, though, praise must be given to the leads and supporting cast for many of the aforementioned points. Murphy and Dornan are absolutely superb in their respective roles, convincingly portraying every emotion one can only imagine someone feeling in such terrifying and uncertain circumstances. They probably had an equal amount of screen time, with most of their scenes together, yet both were able to convey their character's personalities and traits overtly and convincingly, allowing the audience to fully distinguish those motivations and fears between them.The likes of Toby Jones, Harry Lloyd and Charlotte Le Bon also all did their part, Le Bon especially standing out as a victim of circumstance as a result of the operation.Of course, this story is merely one subplot of the atrocities of WW2, and interspersed throughout Anthropoid are reminders of these. Needless to say, Heydrich himself is symbolic of the evil of the Nazi regime, yet the question remains given the severity of the repercussions that followed the assassination attempt, whether he was ever even a sensible target. This is therefore astute storytelling and far from a generic WW2 movie in which the good guys beat the bad guys. It asks questions, and highlights perhaps some of the more unfamiliar victims of the Nazi oppression.As such, this is far from a light hearted, no-brainer action romp. It's deep, dark, disturbing, intense and thought-provoking, and it's superb! For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
" A necessary remake of a heroic tragedy - well done
",0.0772,0.8134,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,This tragic WW2 story of the Czech resistance and assassination of hangman Heydrich has been told before on screen. The story is so good that it deserves this new version. There was an old miniseries from the 70s or 80s Operation Daybreak that was well made but Anthropoid has far more exciting battle sequences in the Church with new filming techniques of today. Also the on location shooting in Prague makes things seem realistic. The torture and tragic battle at the end are quite harrowing.The actors are all good. Jamie Dornan blends in well and shows he doesn't have to be typecast by 50 Shades. Cillian Murphy is always a mesmerizing actor - here he doesn't dominate which is good. The cast all try to put on Czech accents which lends authenticity to the movie but sometimes it's hard to get all the dialog. Doesn't matter though the story doesn't rely on the dialog. The setting in the church and crypt are authentically reproduced. The actual story is faithfully told. A little more follow up about the fate of the protagonists good and bad at the end would have been a welcome epilogue. This movie deserved a wider audience and showing at the box office. It's kind of sad that a movie like Allied because of big names and marketing is more widely seen than a real war movie like Anthropoid. This movie is better than Man with the Iron Heart.
" Poor direction, lacking in real suspense or tension.
",-0.6597,0.9305,2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"I really wanted to like this film. I liked the cast, and the theme, being a big fan of WWII films. But, there was something lacking for me. I think I can sum it up by saying that throughout the first half of the film, in the buildup to the big act, there was little in the way of menace, on the part of the SS troops. They were not all that scary. And there was minimal tension, for a plot like this one. The director did not seem capable of creating that. I noticed he has minimal experience, and my guess is that the studio decided to go on the cheap with this director. A huge mistake. It could have been a very good film. It was a decent film. Would I watch it again, if I knew? No. Probably not.Also, the decision to use mostly hand held camera, saved them a bundle, but gave the film a Cloverfield kind of effect. It did not work. I do despise hand held cinematography. Once in a while it works. Most of the time it does not. In this case, it was a disaster."
" A well-crafted historical action thriller that brings forward a tragically prominent story with high emotional resonance.
",-0.1027,0.9522,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"It is a testimony to a collective failure of humanity in the modern world especially considering the volume of massacre and the reach of Nazi Germany. At the same time, it is also a phenomenal display of hope and extraordinary courage through actions of certain individuals while staring down at an impending ruthless torture and certain death. Though the oppressions of Nazi rule against Jews is well documented (even though it is never enough), their brutality against Czhechs is never highlighted as it could have been. This movie intends to change that with a crash course on history engulfed around a thrilling main plot to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, the architect behind the Final Solution.Jan Kubis (Jamie Dornan) and Josef Gabcík (Cillian Murphy) are sent by the Czech government-in-exile to assassinate Nazi Germany 3rd-in- command SS Officer Reinhard Heydrich, which is code named Operation Anthropoid. They take refuge in Moravec's residence, a family of Czech resistance sympathizers from where they do the recce of Heydrich's movements. While the local resistance group led by Uncle Hajský (Toby Jones) and Ladislav Vanék (Marcin Dorocinski) does support them despite their internal varying opinions about the impact and consequence, the day to execute the operation gets preponed due to an intel about recall of Heydrich back to Berlin. Are they ready to go through with the operation?A retelling of such a historically prominent story requires the right perspective, right tone and also should capture the emotions right to strike a chord with the audience. Anthropoid starts in the right direction with utmost sincerity but seems to have faltered somewhere in between that I can't quite place. Though featuring a large ensemble cast with only a few relatively known faces does help with its narrative to let the audience just see the characters. The production values and art direction are solid which brings the period to life with attention to detail and setting up most scenes in the interiors does help too. Instead of being a deviation, the romantic subplots acts as a window to the assassin's emotional state of mind. There are some moments which are not for everyone, especially the torture sequence of Ata, the 17 year old son of Mrs. Moravec which is gritty and impactful. While it is a solidly made historical action thriller, a critical view does bring forth some aspects which could have been better. The climax showdown shows the highly trained fully equipped German soldiers going down like ninepins when confronted by the Czech resistance with just their pistols and submachine guns. The entire narrative when looking at it in retrospect does pan out sentence by sentence from Wikipedia, a little non-linear approach in terms of script could have elevated it a bit. A standard Hollywood gimmick to establish hope before curtailing it comes to the fore when the escape route from the church to the sewers was discovered, or when Ladislav finalizes the coffins under which he plans to smuggle the refuges out of the church. These events possibly might not have happened and does stuck out like a sore thumb. But you never know, sometimes truth can be stranger than fiction. A well-crafted historical action thriller that brings forward a tragically prominent story with high emotional resonance."
" My personal favorite WW2 Film
",0.4588,0.612,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I have seen a lot of WW2 films from all sides. I've seen many Yugoslav films from my own country, American films showing either theaters (Pacific or Europe), a few from different countries like France, Poland, etc. quite a few Holocaust ones, ones with their own internal conflict (Finland's war with Russia) etc. I've seen many, many Russian ones (most recently Panfilov's 28) and American ones (Saving Private Ryan, but recently Hacksaw Ridge). I've seen expensive ones and cheap ones (Pathfinders: In the Company of Strangers, budget is supposedly $0, it's all volunteer work), serious ones about the Holocaust and comic ones like Tarantino's. I've seen short ones (The German, 2008) and I've seen Band of Brothers.I've seen a lot, more than most people.Having said that, this one is my favorite. It's the only one where I felt I was there, I was not just an observer, but I felt like I was part of the crew. This is the only film, war or not, in which I felt that I was there. I've never had such a strong connection to a film before.There may be inaccuracies, the personalities were a bit filmified/movie-ized, but this movie gets 10/10 on the acting and delivery of emotion.Wow. Just wow."
