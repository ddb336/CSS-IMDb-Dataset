" Did these guys all become special forces operators overnight
",0.4019,-0.4422,2021-03-25 00:00:00,4,I dont watch movies to nit pick or call out things. But this kid probably never even been in a plane and he is doing HALO jumps really? I guess if there had been a montage showing training but all the things these kids do would take years to become experts at and there experts at everything all of a sudden especially eggsy or whatever dumb name the British give him. Are we supposed to believe he just a chip off the old block he can all of a sudden be a super stud? Im sorry that bothered me I know with wild super villan they going for a new millennial type of James bond. MEH.
" It's stupid, I love it
",0.2023,0.9683,2021-03-18 00:00:00,8,"This film is very stupid. The plot is average, the action sequences are over the top and the CGI is laughably bad. But this movie is still great just because it is so much fun to watch. The jokes are hilarious and the cast is wonderful."
" this made me want more.
",0.0772,-0.4391,2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,"It was way more fun than the last few James Bond movies.This spy movie has more attitude, personality and flexibility. The villains had personality and was not a cardboard cut out like from other generic spy movies.This movie was about finding the new ""good""spies to fight the bad evil spy. It's based on the comic book by Icon Comics.This movie has so much action, moments and characters that made this series stand out more than James Bond. I was never into James Bond. However, Kingsman won my respect.What can be learned? Its not just an umbrella.Verdict: Spy King"
" What's funnier.the religious nutters 'reviewing' here with one stars or the film!
",0.0,0.6072,2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,"An hilarious combo of comedy, thriller, and drama. Reading the pathetic reviews here from conservative nutters that completely missed the point is equally hilarious.
If Tarantino has a real sense of humour he might make a movie as funny as this.
It's got it all...tension, laughs, over the top violence so utterly ridiculous anyone taking offence really needs to get a life.
Better than bond and funnier than Tarantino...not for kids but a 10 star thrill-fest!"
" Ridiculus

" Fantastic but a question that's maybe answered..
",0.3182,0.9232,2021-03-10 00:00:00,9,Why at the end didn't the girl tell his mum to turn her phone off?? Would have saved a her trying to kill her kid.. maybe her neighbours had a phone but I'm sure the basis was specific distance and she could have put the kid in there as a precautionary measure. Prob wouldn't have made it as entertaining but there you go. Cracking film though. Love it!
" Kingsman: a modern spy movie
",0.0,0.9888,2021-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Who said spy movies are out of fashion? Kingsman proofs the direct opposite.Without too many spoilers, let's talk a little bit about the cast. Eggsy the boy who likes to get into trouble and doesn't want to listen to anyone is played by Taron Egerton. In my opinion, the cast is very good, he is young and plays the roles of the street kid who is being trained to be a British secret agent really well, it gives the film a certain freshness that tends to appeal to younger viewers. His teacher Galahad is played by Colin Firth. He and Mark Strong (Merlin) are perfect for this film - they play their roles very well. Now we come to the antagonist Mr. Valentine, a huge corporate mogul aiming to make a new world. The crazy opponent who can't see blood but wants to wipe out more than 90 percent of the world's population. Samuel L. Jackson plays his role very well. In my opinion, it's a very good cast.The story itself is ok. The viewer gets a good introduction to what happened and there are no places where you have to ask yourself what has just happened. Nevertheless, there are a few inconsistencies that I do not yet understand. There are a lot of extremely violent scenes so it's not for everyone.
From the graphics it's a very good Movie the cgi effect are very well made and you they clearly used their budged really well. Especially the explosions at the end are very beautiful.In summary, it's a very good cast, it has a good story but some scenes are not for everybody. If you don't like much blood and don't want to es much violence i would suggest to watch a cuttetest version on tv. All in all I would give the Film 8/10 Stars because it's a very good Movie."
" I definitely watched it too many times...
",0.4019,0.9796,2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"This is definitely my favorite movie. The visuals are just gorgeous. I can definitely recommend it. There is really cool tech and really cool looking scenes with music which I love.
The movie has an overall ironic vibe which adds in to being a great movie."
" Best Action movie if you love violent movies!!!
",0.7488,0.9557,2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is awesome! If you like to see fight scenes,then you will love this movie! Samuel L. Jackson is in this and he is my favorite actor!! Love it!!"
" One of the coolest spy movies ever made.
",0.0,0.9921,2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I am not a big spy movie fan. I don't like James Bond or Jason Bourne as much as I should. The Mission: Impossible movies are actually great (with exception of 2 and 3). One of the reason I don't like spy movies as much, is because it's too serious and not that funny. Matthew Vaughn decided to make a funnier spy movie, and it worked amazingly well. Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the best action movies I've seen, and it got some of the best action scenes of all time. Almost everything in this movie is great. I watched this first time in September and I've already watched it 5 times in 5 months. I just love this movie. I expected this movie to be great, but not this great. This was 2 hours and 9 minutes pure happiness.This movie gets a 10/10 because it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. Although, after watching it a lot, I kinda see some problems showing up. I've memorized the whole script, and I feel like there is some problems with it. It could have had tougher lines and less swearing.Also, there is one little problem I'm willing to overlook, but it kinda irritates me. It's when an important character dies in the movie around 45 minutes before end, it feels like they just don't care too much. They mourn in one scene and then moves on like nothing happened.But except from that, everything else in this movie is perfect. The casting is perfect, but better in the sequel. The action sequences is perfect, at least the one in the church. The choreography is perfect. The adaptation from comic book is perfect, although I've never read the comic book. A lot of stunning and visual things is perfect. I missed the movie every time I was done watching it. I really want to live in the Kingsman world.If you're willing to overlook the small problems this movie has, I guarantee this is a 10/10. And you have to watch it if you haven't already."
" Sunk By Gore and SLJ
",0.0,-0.7534,2021-02-27 00:00:00,2,"What could have been an engaging cross between James Bond and Marvel comics is marred by misplaced vulgarity, over-the-top gore, and the ineptitude of Samuel L. Jackson. The premise of twenty-somethings vying for a spot in a secret society of British super agents is promising, but the storyline moves disjointedly between comedy/adventure and Pulp Fiction-like violence. Colin Firth shines as the veteran Kingsman, and Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson are fine as Kingsman candidates, but Jackson is a lame villain who doesn't have the charm or acting chops to fill his role. A movie like this needs a Hans Gruber, and Jackson is no Alan Rickman. ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a good idea; with the right script and a compelling villain it could have been much better"
" Make this the next James Bond series
",0.0,0.9677,2021-02-26 00:00:00,10,"Let's retire JB and that played out franchise and make 30 more of the Kingsman films!!
This is exactly what you want from your action-spy-films. From the colorful megalomaniac villains, to bombastic stakes, heart-wrenching double-crosses and incredible gadgets. The spy film is not a new genre, so this film did a great job of making a super compelling story from a well-known subject.
The characters are easy to root for. The dialogue is clever. The relationships and interactions are believable. It is a very easy film to enjoy.
I'll watch it again and again. Highly recommended."

Evennthough the new bonds are so much better than the dated older ones thus still takes the cake. Excellent cast Colin Firth is phenomenal his action scenes are flawless, the church scene is already legendary!! When you cant find 1 flaw in a movie sorry its a 10!!

" The League of Gentlmen
",0.0,0.8689,2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,"I was returning home from work late one night in 2014 to find the area in Hackney where I was then living partially cordoned off and full of film crew with walking-talkies because they were shooting a car chase for this droll cross between 'Pygmalion, 'The Avengers' and 'Men in Black'. With Colin Firth in the John Steed role, it succeeds in being fun despite rather than because of the fussy direction, constant special effects and noisy music.Good to see two women on the original team rather than just the usual one."
" One of the best films I've ever seen
",0.6369,0.9666,2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. I thought it was one of my top 3 action movies (with Fallout and actually Endgame). A second of it, I adored. The action is awesome, the villain is one of the best I've seen in movies, the score is adoring, everything about Kingsman: The Secret Service worked. Did I mention how riveted I was in the amazing church sequence?"
" A Classy and Polished Display
",0.4404,-0.9992,2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,"The spy comedy film provides us with the journey of young city boy Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin. The film begins with Lee Unwin, the father of Eggsy, sacrificing himself to protect his superior during a mission in the Middle East, this is 1997. Harry Hart, a loyal member of the secret service and played by Colin Firth, returns to London and gives Lee's widow Michelle and son Gary a medal engraved with an emergency assistance number. We see Eggsy as a casual teenage boy in the city of London, causing bother with an audience of friends and getting into trouble as a result, his rebellious nature sees him steal the car of a man confronting him in a pub, closely followed by him being arrested. This nature of Gary is reasoned by not only the mental affect of losing his father at a young age, but an aggressive and abusive step-father who lives with him and his mother in a compact flat in London. The protagonist rings the number provided on the medal, introducing the arrival of Harry Hart to bail him out. The two head to the same pub and talk about the spy association and the history of his father; we are confronted with a very polished looking spy, all black suit, gelled hair and glasses adding a sense of class and etiquette to the service. This at first seems pretentious to Eggsy and disregards the concept, until the same group that Eggsy stole the car from enter the scene, dealt subtly yet expertly by Hart with a combination of unique weaponry and intelligence to leave all members lifeless souls on the ground, taking minimal effort from Colin Firth's character. Eggsy, now invested in the concept, wants to know more from Hart, and is taken on a tour of the facilities used within the service, all with prestigious hidden doorways and underground transport. Taron Egerton's role as Eggsy understands his lack of education and the hostile environment at home is worth costing for a chance to become in the service and applies for the training. The training involves both psychological and physical tests of teamwork and strength. The organisation is named for the tailor shop that clothed them. The organisation training is held by Merlin, the technical support operative and players are eliminated through poor scores or severely lacking in the challenges. Eggsy left with his seemingly only friend on the course, Roxy are the last two standing for a place in the service. The final challenge sees the two in separate rooms, Eggsy placed with Michael Caine's character Arthur, the Kingsman's leader, the instruction is to shoot the Pug, who had partnered Eggsy throughout the course - a test of mental strength and extent of ruthlessness, Eggsy refuses to do so and instead points the gun towards Arthur, refraining from pulling the trigger he leaves the building, to the news that Roxy did so and named the new ""Lancelot"". Eggsy's most difficult challenge so far, walking away from an entire new lifestyle and opportunity. He returns to his Mother and young sister in London, before searching for his step-father. Eggsy, at this point raging, locates Dean at the same pub that we see earlier in the film, significant that we see the pub on three separate occasions, suggesting its hostility and identifying it as a place of conflict. His approach towards Dean Baker is halted by the uncontrolled car steering away from the scene, by the influence of a Harry Hart. The frustration is maximal within Eggsy and encounters Harry to complain about getting him into the situation in the first place and is aggravated by the thought of killing an innocent puppy, soon counteracted by Hart who states that the bullets were computerised and it was the strength to actually pull the trigger that was the task. Professor Arnold features in the opening sequence of the film, seen in the mountains of Argentina, captured by the female assassin Gazelle, in the aim to implant a chip in the neck of the Professor, as a trial planned by Gazelle's employer Richmond Valentine, played by Samuel L Jackson. It is found out by Merlin that Arnold returned to work with new issues, when Harry meets with him, the chip explodes and kills the professor. Where Hart traces back the chip to the internet billionaire and philanthropist Valentine. The SIM cards offered to everyone in the world for free by Valentine, granting lifetime cellular and internet connectivity proved a popular purchase, begging Hart to meet with Richmond face-to-face over some lunch, a McDonalds specifically, and learns about Valentines connection to an obscure hate-group to a single church in Kentucky. Hart travels over to the church with Eggsy watching, as Richmond is set to activate the SIM cards on the people in the group, causing the parishioners to become murderously violent, in an incredible scene, a fast paced routine full of combinations of killings from a Hart, leaves him the only survivor inside the building, exposing the evident brutality of the chips, as Hart evacuates the building, he is met with Valentine who stands with a gun pointing towards the spy, without hesitation the villain shoots Harry in the face, much to Eggsy's despair. The protagonist returns to the headquarters and sits with Chester ""Arthur"" King, who has a scar on his neck identical to the one on the professors. Kings explains to Eggsy the plan of Richmond Valentine, who will transmit his ""neurological wage"" worldwide via satellite network, believing the resulting ""culling"" of the human race will avert its extinction by global warming. Only those Valentine has chosen, willing and unwilling, will be unaffected. King attempts to poison Eggsy, but Eggsy switches the glasses, causing Arthur to poison himself. Essentially, we see the leader of the Kingsman service, add to the problem and create the problem, rather than preventing the problem. This sets the stage for Merlin, Eggsy and Roxy to stop Valentine from activating the SIM cards. Merlin is used as the catalyst, creating the plan and flying the plane; Roxy uses high-altitude balloons to destroy one of Richmonds satellites and break up the network, yet is quickly replaced by the evilness of Valentine. Merlin flies Eggsy to Valentines base and Eggsy masquerades as Arthur at the celebration of the live activation. Eggsy is quickly found out by failed Kingsman recruit Charlie Hesketh and both Eggsy, who presents himself as almost a clone of his master ""Galahad"" (Harry Hart), and Merlin were cornered. With the 129 minute film coming to a close, Merlin trusts Eggsy's advice and activates the implanted chips' failsafe, killing almost everyone with a chip - this done afterwards Eggsy informs Roxy to call his mother and lock away his younger sister, preventing the inevitable violent nature of his mother as a result of the SIM card. Much to Valentines anger, he activates the signal and triggers worldwide pandemonium, seeing a gritting clip of Eggsy's vicious mother, breaking down the door to attack her young child. With the celebration centre isolated the hall is left with just Gazelle and Eggsy in an exciting battle, seeing the latter killing his opponent, the new agent then uses Gazelles prosthetic leg to throw towards Richmond, killing him and stopping the signal and pandemonium across the world. Various clips are consecutively shared from a mixture of destinations around the world with conflict coming to a sudden stop, most crucially Eggsy's mother's attack on her daughter. With the mission complete, Eggsy is pronounced as the new ""Galahad"", taking Harts place in the secret service. Eggsy provides his mother and mother and half-sister a new home away from abusive stepfather Dean, who turns down Eggsy's proposal. Eggsy then returns to the very same pub, dressed in his agency suit, dispatches his stepfather in identical fashion to how Harry did earlier in the film. Ending on a moral victory for Egerton's character. The film supplies an extraordinarily picture with an alternative agency aiming to tackle villains and restore purity to the world, a secret service with a hint of smoothness and unique, affective weaponry."

I was disappointed with Samuel L. Jackson's fake slur -- his voice is SO dramatic that this constantly distracted me throughout the film!
I just really like the Kingsman film series -- a LOT.
Oh, the ending {***SPOILER ALERT***}: OK, I'm guy, and throughout the film they were doing all sorts of 'stuff', and I kept saying to myself: ""I rather go and bang the Princess""; who was beautifully played by Hanna Alstr√∂m) Funny thing was, apparently I was not the ONLY one thinking that! At the very very end of the film, our Hero does exactly that! Of course the Princess asked him first: ""Did you save the World?"" -- upon which he replied 'Yes', THEN she allows him into her cell -- so her dating qualifications appear to be a bit on the high side!"

" Once a Knight is Enough for all Kingsmen
",0.0,0.9846,2020-09-21 00:00:00,8,"A long film that is multi-bannered as action, spy, romance, evil hi-tech, etc. It all started as a ""secret"" British secret service composed on the pattern of the Round Table Knights with Merlin and some King Arthur, if any, somewhere in the wings, since the main boss of this table of spies has betrayed and has been recruited by the evil hi-tech bandit, or is it highwayman, who wants to solve the climate change reality by reducing the population ¬´ naturally ¬ª by liberating the aggressive death instinct of all humans with a universal telephone network that implants in their minds a message that massages their hormones very deeply with some electronic hand.The elimination of nine candidates for one vacancy out of ten in this Round Table that is rectangular is funny, but not much more actually. The use of dogs as the ultimate choice criterion, in fact, ""Shoot the dog you have been working with since the very beginning and which has grown along with you"" is absurd. Either the candidate believes the bullets are real and decides that his or her career is more important than the life of this doggy friend of hers or his. Or They believe that no one can be that cruel since we are in Great Britain, and one does not kill a dog, shoot a dog dead, or even use a syringe to do the job. In England, one puts a dog to sleep with at worst a chemical lullaby, certainly not a gun. So, the candidate should know that the bullet is a blank and you can shoot the dog three times, it will not die. At least that's what a gentleman, or as for that a gentlewoman, should think, at once. ""We are British. No cruelty against animals, please. And certainly not against dogs who are not foxes or rats, not even cats.""Then, you will have to explain why the evil mind behind the plan to destroy the overpopulation by making it kill themselves in systematic aggressive killing sprees is black. Not racist, I am sure, just explicitly biased. In the same way, his direct associate is a woman walking, running, dancing, and fighting on two blades instead of legs is not explicitly segregative, only explicitly sexist and anti-spastics, a word coming from the past when polio was common. And you can note the knights, all of them, are white, and Merlin is too. Let's be clear. It is a film done for white people, just as, if the comic book or graphic novel it is adapted from, this graphic novel was before.The rest is special effects and stunts people, men and women. You will like it and you can even imagine that watching the film will be good for you because you will be doing all these calisthenics along with the actors and actresses, at least in your mental virtual world. There definitely is something wrong with this British planet invading the whole of humanity. They believe they can save the world. It is quite obvious today. The main British COVID-19 vaccine has been terminated in its clinical trials because of some unforeseen side effects. Saving the world? And are they able to save themselves first with their suicidal Brexit, and become the new angel of change in the globalized world?There is a lot of ""vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas"" in this British vanity of a film that is supposed to make us laugh more than think, and it, sure enough, is entertaining on the light side of life. But it is true British actors and actresses are so much better in the Anglo-Saxon forest of Hollywood actors/actresses, that the film becomes a real pleasure. Surely, Taron Egerton has left the fast-food level of acting behind and is quite close to the haute-cuisine level of acting. Isn't it a shame that the British only have one French phrase to designate and name and describe the food production of a real blue ribbon chef, and tac! another French word? They could at least have changed that ""chef"" word along the same line as ""buffetier"" that became ""beefeater.""Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

",0.6369,0.5403,2020-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Seeing as if most of the action movies do not depict violence as detailed as it can be, Kingsman stands out from all the others due to its outstadingly made fighting and shooting scenes, which by the way do not show much blood (sometimes a lot of gore).

" Over the top spy movie
",0.2023,0.9963,2020-08-29 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a spy movie that premiered in 2014. The movie is based on a comic book series The Secret Service. The movie follows a young Englishman named Eggsy who follows in his father's footsteps in becoming a Kingsman.Kingsman: The Secret Service is an utterly ridiculous movie. This movie has excellent action sequences that are directed by Matthew Vaughn. It is supremely entertaining to watch this movie solely for the action sequences. The action sequences are also creative and fresh in its presentation and setup. There are many sequences that had an interesting twist.The dialogue in this movie is one of the best parts of the movie. The dialogue had me laughing whenever Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, or Taron Egerton were on the screen. These three had a great presence and their lines were delivered in an exciting way. Samuel L. Jackson playing Richmond Valentine had one of the most hilarious roles I have seen for Samuel L. Jackson and he plays it magnificently. I did not find any faults with his role and his villainous goal was even entertaining to play out on the screen.Sofia Boutella did an excellent job in her role as the side kick to Richmond Valentine. Sofia Boutella had great choreographed action scenes and her role was intimidating to the intensely trained Eggsy. It was awesome watching her and Eggsy duel in the climax.Colin Firth plays the father figure to Eggsy and he is phenomenal in the role. Colin Firth brings stoic charm to the movie and it makes for exciting scenes when he and Taron Egerton are on the screen. These scenes have a wholesome quality to them.I highly recommend 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'.Grade: B"
" Original action scenes, a funny and brilliant movie that you can watch with everyone
",0.8402,0.9839,2020-08-28 00:00:00,7,"A few action movies managed to keep me until the end. Kingsman hasn't the most original story, but from a technical perspective it is one of the best things that I watched in years. First of all, action scenes are truly amazing, camera movements really immerse you on fights, there is the right mix of special effects and practical stunts and shots are very dynamic.The cast is formed by big stars and as always Samuel L. Jackson managed to play perfectly this parody of the classic villain, as well as Colin Flirth as the gentlemen/main manager of the secret service agency.The movie is fun, and you can watch with everyone, for sure a movie that stands out, compared to the infinite action flicks that are released every year."
" Manners Maketh Man
",0.0,0.9985,2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"The genre of action and suspense in the 21st century has become more than just crowded. Studios constantly upheave any action movies that reach their desk with little consideration of the quality and love the movies deserve. When I encountered the trailer for Kingsman during the previews at the theaters, I ultimately brushed it aside as another B-List movie with great spectacles.Few months after its release, I picked it up based on the good feedback the movie received. Unlike 90 percent of blockbuster actions movies, this movie actually has a soul. It tells a compelling story of Eggsy, a kid who lives in complete agony knowing the true potential he has but honorably chose to stay home to take care of his mother and baby sister. This type of personal touch to a character is prevalent in many characters you'll encounter in this film and this is one of many reasons why this isn't your usual summer action movie. Characters have believable and grounded motives. Characters would not do stupid predictable things but instead act naturally and react to events like living breathing people. This may not sound like a big deal because we're all so accustomed by it but it makes a big difference as its added layer of realism and believability.This being an action movie, how good is the action and fight scenes? Well, maybe one of the best in the genre. In a age where the public has become heavily desentized from guns, explosions and plot armor characters have in fights scenes, Kingsman copies very little of these aforementioned elements while also creating genuine enjoyment and nail biting moments through its scenes. The cinematography is excellent throughout the film and the decision to make very little cuts and shake helps show the power of the Kingsman agents while also making the fights easy to follow and generally clean.The music composed by Matthew Margeson and Henry Jackman is splendid and should belong in everyone's playlist no questions asked. In particular, the sky diving theme really helped showcase the amazement and excitement characters were having in that scene. Other notable highlights in the score include the legendary bar scene and subway scene which would not be what they are without the magic of the music.In general, this isn't the movie you think it is. It's a movie with a lot of heart and love. You can tell that everyone involved in making this film really wanted to create something unique and with passion. It's a movie where just like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, you wanna belong in to just to explore and discover the secrets of the world. Its not a good movie, it's a great movie and I hope the team can carry this passion with the other sequels. - H"
" Incredible spy thriller
",0.1027,0.9783,2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is an incredible spy thriller that's extremely fun, stylish and self aware whilst skillfully subverting conventions of spy movies. Taron Egerton and Colin Firth are both incredible. Mark Strong, Sophie Cookson, Sofia Boutella and Michael Caine are all great and Samuel L. Jackson is an excellent villain. Matthew Vaughn's direction is fantastic and it's extremely well filmed with intense and thrilling fight scenes. The music by Henry Jackson and Matthew Margeson is amazing and the soundtrack is really good."
" A basic and crass attempt at a spy thriller/ comedy, not doing any part of it well.
",0.5574,0.9191,2020-08-02 00:00:00,1,"Script is weak, performces are bang average across the board and none of the characters have any depth or are vaguely likeable.
Camera work and special effects are cheap and shoddy looking; it's like if the Sun newspaper started writing spy stories, not worrying if it's good or even slightly realistic, just get it out and hope noone notices that it's utter nonsense.Huge swing and a miss for me. I feel like this has been aimed at the ""xfactor generation"" and is so basic that a toddler could follow it without difficulty. I certainly won't be watching the sequel."
" Who says suits are cool? Kingsman says so!!
",0.4374,0.9439,2020-07-30 00:00:00,9,"I meant to see Kingsman for years now, and the only reason why I didn't see it before was, as crazy as it is. I'm like Richmond Valentine. ""No Stomach for Violence."" Nonetheless, I rented it from Vudu when they had Family Play, and I enjoyed it tremendously!This is what The Avengers (1998) should have been, just not with the gratuitous violence and language. Kingsman has a good sense of humor, a great story, and amazing casting. I loved Samuel L. Jackson's character especially his lisp. I quote him all the time, even though it sort of gets on my Families' nerves.By the way, I love the way Valentine says: ""Mr. Devere!"" It's hilarious! I'm personally an American, but this movie made me appreciate British culture even more than I already do. If you are like me and feel uncomfortable watching Violent scenes, here's a secret. Watch it with Clearplay, they will Edit out those scenes for you and you can still enjoy the movie. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to buy a Kingsman suit!!"
" This movie is like a James Bond film on steroids. But, is it a rip-off of the James Bond franchise or it's own unique thing?
",0.1901,0.9981,2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (2014), when I saw this movie for the first time, I didn't know what to expect. Sometimes going into a new film with little to no expectations is a good thing, sometimes it's a bad thing. In the case of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"", it's a very good thing. This movie more than exceeded the expectations I didn't even realize I had! What an unexpected surprise this film was, I found myself really enjoying it. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, great special effects, and of course a phenomenal soundtrack to tie it together. At first glance, it looks like another Bond parody or rip-off. I can assure you, it is not. This movie is based on a comic book series of the same name by Dave Gibbons and Mark Millar. I haven't read any of the comic books, but if this film is any indication, then the comics must be excellent! The story in this movie had me invested from beginning to end, which is what a plot line in a film should do. I found myself looking forward to what happened next, plus, there are plenty of twists and turns throughout that you will not see coming! All of the action scenes were very well choreographed. One of my top ten all-time favorite action movie sequences in any film is the church scene in this movie. It's five minutes of non-stop action, violence and excitement. All occuring with the song ""Freebird"", by Lynyrd Skynyrd playing. Doesn't get much more perfect than that! We'll go into more details about the soundtrack of this movie in just a minute. But, just like that scene, the rest of the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. All of the actors and actresses put on stellar performances and really bring their characters to life. My only nitpick, and it's just a little nitpick. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Richmond Valentine, has a lisp whenever he speaks. At first, it can get on your nerves, but after a couple of scenes, you get used to it. Other than that, he plays a brilliant villain! Seriously, did they have to give him a lisp? Unless his comic book character talks like that, what's the point of it? The sets/locations are perfect and give this movie a great atmosphere. All of the special effects in this movie are very well done. However, some of the CGI looks a bit over the top during some of the fight scenes. It's almost a bit cheesy! But, at the end of the day, I still give it a pass. The special effects that are perfect outweigh the over the top ones. Finally, the soundtrack is perfect and ties the movie together. I especially love the inclusion of ""Freebird"", by Lynyrd Skynyrd. That is one of my top 10 favorite rock and roll songs of all-time. It really gave the action scene in the church a whole new level of depth! ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is definitely a big crowning achievement (no pun intended) in the genre of action films. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"", go see it. Or else, Richmond Valentine may inflict his evil plans against you and the world!"
" Well Tailored! It Fits Very Nicely!
",0.7075,0.9734,2020-07-20 00:00:00,9,"This film is a real blend of James Bond, Austin Powers and The Man From U.N.C.L.E with loads of other stuff thrown in. I love it, I love Mr Strong, who is a very under-rated actor, I love seeing Colin and Samuel doing something different and I adore Taron in this role. He is the perfect cheeky chappy, who you just know would have your back as a mate and he's very attractive to boot.
It's a great concept for a film, with some good laughs, excellently choreographed fight scenes and interesting twists and ideas.
A few scenes of Taron naked would have been great, but I can't have everything."

Kingsman: The Secret Service is an exhilarating original spy adventure with great touches of comedy and glorious stunts! I love how Samuel L. Jackson is in hundreds of different projects over the last several decades. So epic the church sequence that should be praised more! Love this glad I own in 4K.

I do understand there is a setup for the scene and mood but it just beats around the bush a little too long.But the last 45 minutes of the movie is when it starts getting good.

" Elite movie that is a must watch
",0.0,0.9962,2020-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Have you ever loved a movie so much that you wished you could forget you watched the movie, and then watch it again. Whether you have or have not done this, this is exactly my feelings towards the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service. It is a masterpiece directed by Matthew Vaughn that came into theatres in 2014. It reached an astounding $414.4 million from the box office. After watching the movie I would say this movie combines aspects from both James Bond and Deadpool. It combines the mission and training type stuff from James Bond while also having a comedy relief like we have seen in Deadpool. If you have not seen Kingsman yet, I would definitely recommend it and here's why.
The first reason that this movie clicked so well was because they had a great cast that all fit into their character very well. The cast included big names such as Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Firth, and Mark Strong. Another actor that played a big part in the movie was newcomer Taron Egerton, he played a large part in why the movie succeeded. You could easily tell that all the actors cared about this movie and gave it their all.
The second reason that this movie was very good was because of the cinematography. The cinematography in this movie is very unique and unlike most action movies. During scenes where there are shootouts going on, they often have the cameras moving around the actors while shots are being fired which gives the movie a very unique feel. Since this cinematography is so unique whenever it occurs it intensifies the scenes and drags the viewer into the movie. I have read that similar styles are used in the movie Kickass, but since I have not seen these movies I can not confirm.
The third reason that this movie worked was because of a very entertaining plotline. The plot from the very beginning is never dull. There is always action and stuff going on that draws the viewer in. The plot continuously flows from the main characters backstory, to training to become a kingsman and then right into their first mission. One of the only things that I found problematic within this movie was the fact that they used an american church as a location for a brutal gunfight scene. Some could say this is taking advantage of american stereotypes, but other than this I feel that the plot in this movie was very strong.
The fourth and final reason why the movie was a hit was because of a strong soundtrack. They combined good songs along with memorable background music during important lines. The soundtrack allowed the viewer to better understand the scenes by setting the tone. Another reason why this is a good soundtrack is because it also adds energy and tempo to the movie.
In conclusion I believe that Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service is an elite movie. It combines aspects of good acting, cinematography, entertaining plotline, and soundtrack. Like I said at the beginning of this review, if you have not seen Kingsman: The Secret Service, I highly suggest it."
" Outrageous parody
",-0.4588,0.6344,2020-06-01 00:00:00,7,"This film has an outrageous style of humour that may not work for everyone. Even still, the overall story, acting, action sequences and the protagonist's adventure are more than satisfactory."

I watched it the first time and to be fair was half watching it just not really engaged. So couple of years later here I am watching it again with a more open mind and second time round I loved it. My advice is to ignore the reviews and watch it and don't take it too seriously and like I say you will either enjoy it or just switch it off far to soon. No film can ever be that bad when KC and the Sunshines brilliant song Give it up is on the soundtrack can it. Thought the fight scene in the church was spectacular!! I gave it an 8 but could easily have got higher.

This is a hard-R and totally missed the James Bond aspect of ""allude to but don't offend"".

Recruits are primarily ""upper class"" until recently. The head known as ""Arthur"" steadfastly upholds that tradition. During an exercise to find the next replacement almost costs the entire squad.

The test when the recruits had to parachute in pin point accuracy was my favorite even after watching the movie several times I'm still on the edge of my seat.Enter Richmond Valentine, in a previous review I compared the character to if Bill Gates and Al Gore had a child. His maniacal portrayal as an over the top eco-warrior was nothing short of brillant and stole the show. HE SHOULD HAVE WON THE OSCAR FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR!Finally learning that the organization has been compromised Merlin and the ""new"" Lancelot place their trust in Eggsy to help save the day. My objection is that the ""Academy"" wouldn't know a show stealing performance if it bit them in the backside."

" A great spy film
",0.6249,0.9932,2020-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Taken from the comic book bt Dave Gibbons and Mark Millar, Kingsmen is all about what it takes to go from a commoner to one of the men on her majesty's secret service. If anything, this is one of the rare comic book movies that improves upon its source material.Matthew Vaughn (Stardust, Layer Cake, Kick-Ass) does a great job with this film, making a better Bond film than Bond films.Ever since a tragic mission in 1997, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) has felt like he owed the family of Lee Unwin - who died to save his life - something. He gave the family a number of they ever need him and seventeen years later, Eggsy - Lee's son - calls him. As played by Taron Egerton, he becomes the true hero that the Kingsmen - a secret organization of spies devoted to protecting the United Kingdom - has been looking for.He must also deal with Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), a rich genius using free wireless to cut down the Earth's population. He's backed up by Gazelle (Sofia Boutella, Atomic Blonde), a killer with prosthetic legs.Plus, Mark Strong is great as the handler Merlin and Michael Caine can be in as many spy movies as he'd like.I love that the idea of this movie is pretty much how Terence Young turned Sean Connery into James Bond. Millar said, ""Young realized he had to turn Connery, this rough Edinburgh guy, into a gentleman, and before they started shooting the movie, he took him to his tailor, to his favorite restaurants, and basically taught him how to eat, talk, and dress like a gentleman spy.""This movie made me so pleased because someone remembers how to make a Eurospy movie with style while not being overly referential to what came before."
" Quirky And Entertaining Nod To Old-School Spy Films
",0.4404,-0.8199,2020-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Pros:
1. The opening scene with Lancelot (Jack Davenport) dispatching a bunch of goons, only to then ultimately meet his own demise by Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), is really stylish and compelling.
2. The action scenes are well-shot, fast-paced, and extremely entertaining. The first bar fight and the mesmerising church fight stand out as prolific examples.
3. The editing is done really well. The fast and quick-cut edits, in particular, help the fight scenes to pop more.
4. The score and soundtrack are used superbly to build up tension, suspense, drama, chaos, sadness, and everything inbetween.
5. The humour is inserted well, it produces charming moments - especially between Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Galahad (Colin Firth) - and it's never too ridiculous or distracting.
6. The film provides an empowering message of taking responsibility for yourself and learning to overcome your natural disadvantages.
7. Samuel L. Jackson (Valentine) gives an amazing performance as an old-school over-the-top spy villain.
8. Galahad's death is shocking and impactful, especially as he served as a father figure for Eggsy.Cons:
1. Somehow, when Gazelle fights Princess Tilde's (Hanna Alstr√∂m) bodyguards, she's able to dodge close-range bullets by simply moving her head.
2. During the parachute training scene, there is obvious use of green-screen which is a little distracting."

Taren Edgerton is such an amazing actor and he plays this role almost perfectly. Is this movie filled with Cliches throughout? Yes! But for some reason the comedy mixed with the elaborate fight choreography makes for an exciting action thriller.

Parts of it are pure nonsense and if you stop to think about any of it realistically it falls apart but it's not trying to be Bond. Quite the contrary, a big part of this is spoofing on old spy flicks.Performances are all spot on, even Jackson's ridiculous lisp feels like it somehow fits in this crazy world. It's the action though that makes this. There are seems of raw heart pounding, edge of your seat, cheering them on as they take on the world moments that make me want to stand up and cheer them on and that is so rare for me.Again, bonkers movie but it knows exactly what it is and it nails it.

(Sidenote: it's great to see Egerton is getting more and more roles now like Johnny in Sing or Elton 'Hercules' John in Rocketman) The action is brilliantly shot and edited, Sam Jackson plays a great villain and Sofia Boutella a great evil assistant. All in all, this film is FUNNY with GREAT ACTION and AWESOME ACTORS/ACTRESSES! I can't begin to explain my sheer love for this film, so if you want to know why, check out this 2015 masterpiece."
" Kingsman The Secret Service: How action and comedy should be combined
",0.3612,0.997,2019-12-12 00:00:00,10,"Colin Firth, Taron Egerton and Samuel L. Jackson, they are part of the cast of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" an excellent movie about Eggsy, a young street man, who is recruited by the secret service called Kingsman, but before Eggsy can be a Kingsman, he would have to survive an extreme training program. Simultaneously, an evil tech man is working in something that could alter the world for worse.The cast is outstanding, and the acting is on point, something expected when you have Samuel L. Jackson as a part of it. Every character is excellent. You can root for the spies but at the same time you don't hate the villains, you hate the villains' plan but not them because they are also funny and smart.The story is a little bit a clich√©. It's a formula about a character being trained to be part of something great and then try to stop a villain to prove he deserves to be part of the group. It is predictable in some aspects, but it's actually really good, the pacing and the jokes make it enjoyable. This movie has some twists that make the story even better.
My conclusion is this movie is an excellent start to a franchise. It's so funny you will laugh in every scene or most of them but at the same time it has absolutely good action scenes. It's bloody funny, give it a try, I'm convinced that you will like it."

Jackson, this unlike many villains, if he has personality, not you In no time to spare on the screen, his motives are justifiable, simply if you see it from another point of view his plan was not so malicious, this was to eliminate part of humanity to start again and save us from extinction, what really bad in this was that he chose those who were going to be saved and let's say that's not very fair, but hey, the point is that he's a very good villain, and without a doubt the violence is just great, I mean is creative, I say When we have seen in a movie a scene like that of the church? The film is well executed in the sense that it explains something, but without wasting time, and something that I really like is Egsy is not the typical annoying character who wants to be good if because, or who wants to defeat the villain with all his strength to Although these are not even found, the film also has personal moments for the protagonists, for example we see how the relationship between father and son between Harry and Egsy is strengthened through the progress of the film, something that was very brave on the part of the movie is to have killed Harry at the moment, I say at the moment because we already know that in the two he is alive and blah, blah, blah, the point is that for us we were dead in that movie, it was something that I grab you without you see it coming, because it is not very common that in today's movies they kill one of the protagonists of the way in which this movie did it, which is another success for the film since this serves as inspiration to Eg s and to return to become a Kingsman and want to defeat Valentine, but as good as this movie is, it is not perfect, I say through which the movie progresses the characters have technological objects that are suitable for the plot, or that no matter how much training they put Eggsy in their preparation to become a Kingsman, we never really saw them teach him how to fight, I say that the movie has mistakes but this does not mean that it is all the good it has.

It's all a bit...toxic. And I have a high tolerance of that kind of thing usually.There's this Swedish Princess that really annoys me.

" Being A Gentlemen Is Something One Learns: Make Him Proud Eggsy!
",0.5255,-0.6061,2019-08-03 00:00:00,7,"In Hollywood, they saw a movie is decided within the first ten minutes of the film. Hollywood will deiced if it's a success or not within ten minutes and so will the audience. Anyways, you certainly need to capture the audiences attention in the first ten minutes of the movie to be a blockbuster hit. Kingsman grabs the audience attention right out the gate and opens with an explosion of action and excitement.Not only does a bomb go off, a kidnapping occur, but a boy's origin story begins. We are introduced to mystery and intrigue right away when powerful characters come into the scene and we don't really know who is the hero or the villain. We just know the characters are really cool and dangerous and when Samuel Jackson walks in the door and is the one who gets to drink the 1962 Dalmore, we know we are in for a good time as the movie progresses.Taron Egerton plays Eggsy, the boy destined for more who is like any charterer in a superhero movie growing into his destiny. He has a rough home life, filled with a lot of abusive douche-bags trying to bang his mom and because he had a dysfunctional and violent home life, he never lives up to his potential though he is highly intelligent and athletic. Like a lot of smart kids from a troubled home, he has a problem with authority so he quits things like the Marines and is no stranger to getting into trouble with the police. The lack of a silver-spoon has set Eggsy on a certain path, but if he is willing to learn, he can become a KINGSMAN.What is cool about the training of the Kingsman, is the contenders die during training. This gives the movie a realistic feel. They trainees are put in life threatening situations and if they are not smart enough to figure it out they die in training. They do not get a lecture about how they can do better next time. Sometimes after a scenario about how the most important lesson is teamwork, they will turn around to see during their attempt to only save themselves, one of their teammates died and they did not even notice until it was pointed out.Visually, the movie is what you would expect from a big budget action film. The scenes are clean and crisp. When it comes to cinematography they used a fast speed style to display fight scenes.The action is rapid and effective.Overall, the movie is filled with excitement, action and your adrenaline is pumping the whole time. The movie is highly entertaining, with underlying political tones that seem to predict future trends, like whoever rules Mobile towers, rules the world.In the end, Eggsy chose not to shoot his dog to get a job. What is interesting is after all his training, he went right back to his old ways, being sucked into the drama with his stepdad. Though you could say it's noble for him to try and protect his mom, in actuality its just a low level of drama that is not worthy of his attention.What is worthy of Eggsy's attention is the church scene massacre, where there is an epic battle leaving not one body alive in the church, but the Kingsman. The free cell phones that were distributed earlier in the movie, were used to emit a neurological wave that made people aggressive and want to kill each other. This was a test for a cull to kill off a large portion of the population as the villain of the story sees humanity as a virus.The bottom line is the Kingsman offers entertainment in a high fashion."

Its target audience is pre-teen white boys. It's not a movie that a normal adult -including those action lovers- can sit through its entire length. Indeed, I was doing something else while watching it with the corner of my eye. Once, my job was finished after 2 hours of TV time -including commercials, I tuned the channel somewhere else, so I don't know how the story ended nor do I care.A lot of reviewers complain about the violence. It's true that the movie is loaded with senseless blood and gore however, its presentation is so puerile that you can't really take it seriously. Take the 10 min long carnage in the church scene, for example. Everything looks so comically surreal and artificial, that it makes you shake your head instead of cringing and looking away. I don't know why Colin Firth, S. Jackson and M. Cain star in this travesty. One would think actors of their stature would be more selective with the quality of the movies they act in, no matter how much they are compensated for. On the other hand, the two lead characters are so lame and fluffy that no amount of heavy weight actor can put the story on its feet."

I appreciate a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and this movie knows how to portray the class that feels like British royalty, but the comedic humor of all classes. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) really excels in this movie and is truly an underdog worth cheering for. I loved the soundtrack and the use of color throughout the film."
" A Truly Strange Black Comedy Action Movie?
",0.5574,0.9545,2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"21 February 2015. It's uncertain whether or not Kingsman reflects the best of the evolving black comedy trend in movies or not and whether such a trend is a passing or permanent element of a classic movie. Whichever it is, Kingsman currently is a superior film with its finely honed balance of black, dark murderous content being portrayed alongside British, gentlemanly wit. This film is a Colin Firth's best actor Oscar high English version of the The King's Speech (2010) meets the comedic spy romp of James Coburn's Our Man Flint (1966) meets the hard edged, raw espionage of the refurbished, rebranded James Bond in the form of Daniel Craig in Casino Royale (2006). Dark comedy in the spy genre has been gaining more prominent film focus as they have evolved from the more entertaining comedy action motif of the popular and zany Wild, Wild West (1999) or the romantic interplay of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) taking on the more darker and serious ambiance of the action crime thriller, The Dark Knight (2008) as Sam Rockwell in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) and Pierce Brosnan in The Matador (2005) seemed to make be some of the first forays into this gumbo of movie genres that began with the classic Pulp Fiction (1994), Kingsman appears to take its basic thematic tone from the blackest of action comedy of Uma Thurman's Kill Bill 1 & 2 (2003, 2004) and incorporating a culturally off-balance brush stroke of the military black comedy war movie Tropic Thunder (2008). Recently a number of movies have taken murderous death and blended these atrocious acts with a finely balanced hue of comedic overtones such as Bill Nighy's Wild Target (2009), Violet & Daisy (2011), Brad Pitt in Killing Them Softly (2012), Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill (2014) and Katie Holme's very proper but fatalistic Miss Meadows (2014). Kingsman includes the added bonus of a strong performance as a villain in the form of a fascinatingly speech impeded Samuel L. Jackson. This dark comedic action thriller comes across as something, fresh, new, and bold while sustaining an especially emotional intensity throughout and grabbing the audience refusing to let them go until the end. Whether or not this whole creatively new comedic frenzied experience is a passing endorphin high or some established benchmark of greatest remains to be seen."

It also has more than its fair share of violence (the odd use of the upbeat song ""Pomp and Circumstance"" in a particular scene is bizarrely unforgettable). Yet it still comes off as entertaining and enjoyable.Like the James Bond films (likely an influence), the gadgets and special effects add much to the entertainment value. Firth also brings along his dependable amount of class and talent especially in a scene when he must verbally defend his actions in a redneck, hate-filled church. Having Michael Caine in the cast is the icing on the cake."
" A good action flick
",0.4404,0.9982,2018-12-08 00:00:00,8,"When a seemingly ordinary boy with a troubled life, especially due to his stepfather, gets recruited by a secret intelligence organization, he's put into a situation where he must learn plenty of new elements, including teamwork. As a result, he must do his best to prove himself as a new great threat arises, putting the whole world in danger.It's a pretty unusual movie, one which introduces a world-wide threat which can only be solved by a couple of highly skilled spies, along with their impressive devices and a brand new recruit who must quickly get accustomed to his new position. I say it's unusual not due to its story, but because of the way it presents it. It has a tendency of not taking itself seriously, thus you get plenty of amazing action sequences but also a lot of sarcastic and funny situations. You won't get to laugh out loud but you'll still have a better time due to it. But, as it often happens when talking about this approach, you can generate some laughs but you also are prone to a reduced amount of thrill and drama. Also, it can become pretty predictable, fact which also doesn't do it much good.The characters involved are well developed, diverse and likeable, played by some very charismatic actors which simply make them shine. If the story is mostly ok, its characters are truly impressive from my point of view. As said before, another very well implemented aspect is represented by the action part, which is full of highly exaggerated combat, shooting and spy-like moves which are truly awesome. It's pretty hard to describe them otherwise as the child in me can't help but be astonished.As previously mentioned, it's quite an unusual movie. If you ask me, it's in a love or hate situation. If you can accept its approach and especially its exaggerations, you're going to have a great time watching it. Otherwise, this might not be the movie for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's a very good movie which entertained me until the end and made me lust for a sequel. If it had a better antagonist and a better story, we would have been talking about a truly great movie."

" One of my all time favorites
",0.4215,0.9897,2018-10-27 00:00:00,10,"The movie Kingsman: The Secret Service is a wonderful film that released in 2014. Directed by Matthew Vaughn, the first instalment of this movie franchise shows the life of a young Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) who goes from a loser in the streets, into a top notch secret agent who saves the world. The movie also features Colin Firth as Harry Hart, who is one of secret service members known as Agent Galahad. Firth does an excellent job in his role, and the viewer really gets attached to his character. The film does a great job of introducing itself to the viewer and makes it clear what is going on. The viewer knows what the agency is all about, and it even gives some insight on how the organization was founded in a way that makes it seem like it could be possible to exist in our world today. Kingsman is also a great comedy, with some of the jokes being directed towards other movies. At one point in the film, the James Bond film franchise is mentioned and made fun of for having using generic spy plot line in all its movies. The film also states in its own dialog that ""This ain't that kind of movie"" when referring to the generic spy film one would expect. Kingsman: The Secret Service is truly a wonderful movie that can shock someone with a big surprise, fill them with laughter, and put them at the edge of their seat as the movie gets closer to its big finale. I find myself going back to it now and then to watch the fantastic film again."

",-0.1779,0.6843,2018-08-20 00:00:00,5,I'm surprised that this film was trying to be a fun & cheeky brit comedy considering the level of intentionally visceral bloodbath violence that's bombastically spread throughout the film's seemingly never ending runtime. How can anyone consider a film to be a comedy when there's terrorism-style bloodshed in every other scene? Do people find this entertaining? I find it confusing and intellectually dishonest.

" Bond. Chav Bond.
",0.0,0.9939,2018-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Kingsman is an entertaining and fun movie. The pace of the film is upbeat and exciting, while the action scenes are an extravaganza of over-the-top, but very enjoyable, choreography. Kingsman: The Secret Service follows a young man, nicknamed Eggsy, who begins the story as a delinquent. Invited into a society of spies, Eggsy undergoes intense training and begins to develop discipline and confidence. Under the tutelage of Hart, his spy mentor, Eggsy becomes a formidable agent and is eventually faced with a Bond-style supervillain.The Eggsy character undergoes a transformative journey that most movie-goers have seen in endless iterations in many different stories. The story begins with a less-than-ideal hero and this hero eventually undergoes a journey that addresses inner turmoil and emerges as a better person. How the film tells this story, however, is what makes the film enjoyable.While the action scenes are the best part of the movie, they can also be downright goofy at times, with people getting cut clean in half or flipping through the air like a rag doll after getting hit. There are also far too many McDonald product placements in the film. The movie also suffers from somewhat generic features, such as; generic premise, plot, and character motivations.Despite these flaws, Kingsman is still an entertaining film. The casting and acting are great, the writing is good, and the pacing is fine. This movie is worth watching based on the spectacular action scenes alone."
" Hilariously daring
",0.3612,0.9861,2018-06-27 00:00:00,10,"Eggsy, a young-looking boy that lives in the suburbs, gets in trouble and, after getting bailed out of prison by a mysterious man, he's offered the chance to become a kingsman. Since this movie came out, it has become one of my favourite movies of all time. It's really easy to follow, the characters are charming in their own way and the dialogue is witty. Not to talk about the action scenes. As a society, we have been exposed to so many action scenes and violence, that not much surprises us, but the way this movie portrays that action is just mind-blowingly good (and quite funny sometimes).It's always a delight to watch anything by Colin Firth, but Taron Egerton (Eggsy) was truly fit to play that character. There's a lot of character development for Eggsy in just one movie, and even when the movie is about fighting, the development doesn't feel rushed because the writers devote part of the movie just so we can see how Eggsy struggles to become the man he should be to represent Kingsman. It's a breath of fresh air to see characters properly developed in an action movie. That's why I like this movie so much, because it's not just mindless violence. Cheers to the writers. Fantastic job."
" A film with an identity crisis
",-0.6249,0.9565,2018-06-16 00:00:00,3,"There are times when Kingsman is almost a sophisticated The Saint-style thriller. Other times, it's a Bond-style tongue-in-cheek action film. Other times again, it's a Hot Fuzz-style comedy gore fest. And then there are bits when it's more like a comic book action film. By trying to be all of those things (often not very well), it's none of them, and the film fails to create its own distinctive ""world"" in the way that all good films do. The result is a disjointed and strangely unsatisfying film that, to its credit, also has a few quite enjoyable bits along the way.Matthew Vaughn said he wanted to inject a sense of humour back into spy films. If that's the case, he has the sense of humour of an adolescent."

However, I did find the villain in the movie was a bit too eccentric to really be taken all that serious, which was a shame because it gave the movie sort of a cheesy comic book quality to it.The special effects in the movie were great and very convincing. The action sequences were great to look at and nicely choreographed.

" Stylish and Widely Entertaining
",0.4404,0.9965,2018-06-02 00:00:00,8,"'Kingsman: The Secret Service' may have a clich√©d and unoriginal plot, but it is excused to it's stylish and entertaining approach and talented cast. This film may have paid homage to spy films such as the well-known-and-loved Bond series, but it's too smart to be considered a parody, but also too silly and ridiculously clich√©d to be considered a serious film. However, this ultimately is excused by the fact that this movie is just so cool! With extremely stylish action sequences, memorable characters portrayed by great actors and hilarious humor, this film is a highly enjoyable watch that will leave its audience in awe. The action in this film is so over-the-top and stylised that it results in being some of the best action sequences I've seen in film for a long time. But the reason this movie is so great is all due to it's cast - Taron Egerton is fantastic as the lead role of Eggsy, but we all know that it was Colin Firth who stole the show. He effortless nails his role, and is essentially the main reason this film is as great as it is. Overall this movie is one of the most entertaining and rewatchable films of 2014 due to its highly talented cast and stylistic approach."
" A bit overrated
",0.0,0.9467,2018-05-07 00:00:00,6,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" tells the story of a privately funded Intelligence Agency, that consists of the best agents, trying to solve cases independent from countries and governments. When a rich enterpreneur plans to decrease humanity through a newly developed sim-card-technology, it is time for the newest members to proof that they earn their membership.For my personal taste, the movie is a bit too colorful and hectical. At points it feels more like a persiflage in itself and you really shouldn't start to think about the inner logic of the plot too much. The later consists of a crime quite similar to one Dan Brown described in one of his novels, only in a rather excentrical and odd way. The production value is high, the film looks great and has every technical feature to be considered a blockbuster. Unfortunately, the characters are a bit stereotypical, the story is rather predictable and the gags not always in the right spot.All in all this movie is a bit overrated in my eyes. I was expecting an adult comic movie such as Kick-Ass but sometimes this felt more like a Scary Movie for spies. The result is not a bad film, it is still quite entertaining and professionally produced but it doesn't stand out from the crowd."

" I'm not convinced this is as good as it THINKS it is, but there is enough to admire to give it a go.
",0.6674,0.9789,2018-04-04 00:00:00,6,"You come away from ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" a little breathless, but more-so down to its bounding energy and sheer brashness than because you feel you have just seen a great film. For sure, the film is a colourful, kinetic experience; a series of brutal body blows which pulls you left; right and centre - across genres and through homages, but that did not stop me from feeling pleased that it was all over when it was. In spite of whatever ""Kingsman"" does well - the good choreography; the want to see the characters make it through their odds; the amusing villain - there is an annoying feeling of puerility to the film, or of immaturity. When Matthew Vaughn released ""Kick-Ass"" in 2010, the cover of a popular British film magazine depicted one of the characters in full superhero garb and the headline 'Say Hello to Your New Favourite Film', and there is that same aggravating, even adolescent, sense with ""Kingsman"". It is difficult to put into words, but I am sure you know what I mean - the film is far from being your typical brain-dead blockbuster, and one cannot fault its ambition, but it lacks a certain nuance or sense of subtlety. The film tells the double-stranded tale of a young London lad getting out of one world and into another alongside a suave veteran of espionage who senses his time is coming to an end as comrades die around him and world threats seem to intensify. Colin Firth plays said veteran: a secret agent by the name of Harry Hart, who operates as Galahad in an all-action British governmental group running in covert operations - try to imagine James Bond's 'Double O' section on steroids. Parallel to him is the story of Taron Egerton's character Gary, colloquially referred to as 'Eggsy', whose father was part of the same eponymous secret service group Galahad is in until he was killed in action some twenty years ago. Raised fatherless, both he and his mother have since fallen on harder times and Gary, now in his early twenties, finds himself occupying a flat in a seedy part of London whilst periodically falling out with his mother's sociopathic new boyfriend and dodging potentially fatal gang warfare. Gary and Galahad's worlds collide when the latter loses yet another agent during a mission in snowy Argentina, wherein a scientist specialising in global warming has been kidnapped and a rescue attempt is botched. Galahad's boss, played by Michael Caine, is losing patience: this particular agent, discovered and groomed by Galahad himself, did not live up to expectations. Gary, meanwhile, is living on even less borrowed time and comes into contact with Firth's character through some relatively convoluted means in order to begin, in true ""Men in Black"" style, his inception into the universe of this elite secret agency.Providing energy to the piece is Samuel L. Jackson's wonderful villain Richmond Valentine; a politician hating eco-terrorist with a speech impediment who has made his name operating in the technology industry and flinches at the sight of blood. He has his henchwoman, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), take care of the more murderous side of being a super villain - think a more nubile version of Richard Kiel's Jaws character, but with legs and feet replacing teeth... We have seen films like ""Kingsman"" before, and we have previously enjoyed narratives similar to what is depicted therein, but Vaughn is canny enough to construct the experience in such a way that has us feel like this is our first time. The film is not manipulative in this respect, but it is brash. As was the case with ""Kick-Ass"", it takes absolutely no interest in whether or not it is offending you or even wearing you down - like it or not, this is the route it's taking. Through whatever means, the film manages to balance both revisionism and convention into a congealed, post-modernist package. The way the film eventually comes to fuse the execution of a dastardly plan Valentine is hatching; Gary undergoing his training and the Kingsman agency uncovering a series of strange occurrences around the world of army militias conspicuously turning on themselves is satisfying. Midway through, Vaughn plummets us headfirst into a steadycam sequence of one of these militias fighting one another in what is a quite striking scene outlining in equal measure both precisely what is at stake should our heroes fail and that the makers of the film have an eye for raw flair and constructive carnage. Despite being an incredibly striking film, this sequence to one side, I am unsure as to whether ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" amounts to much more than a well-made actioner with a familiar tale of a farmhand leaving behind his domestic set-up for world-saving greatness. It deals, mostly, in stereotypes: the fascist American southerners; the suave Westminster Londoner; the Scandinavian blonde and the Millwall Football Club yobs. Meanwhile, you get the feeling there was meant to be a message embedded in the film somewhere to do with the danger of phone/tablet technology, and what it is turning people into, but it gets a little lost. Irrespective, there is enough in ""Kingsman"" to recommend it - it executes what it wants to do with a certain unbridled brazenness and does what it wants with a level of enthusiasm where many other action films too often feel like they are going through the motions. This is not the case here."
" A bit dirty, but way better than the original comic.
",0.705,0.9963,2018-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Ah, The Secret Service... Yet another overrated comic by Mark Millar. Like many of his other works, this one wasn't even fresh enough. It was bunch of the old ideas mixed together with the poor writing. Artwork wasn't that bad, but nah, I never really liked The Secret Service. It was dumb and boring story about how young kid with no future met his uncle, who was a James Bond of sorts. Uncle introduces him to the world of secret service and kid's doing great just because he played enough Call of Duty. Yep, it was that bad. So, when they've announced the movie adaptation, I thought it'll be yet another failure. Like, you know. Like Kick-Ass. But guess what? It was totally different story.The thing is - movie makers took the best part from the original comic and fixed everything that was wrong with it. The best thing about The Secret Service was that Cinderella concept. The idea of how poor guy with no future can become both secret agent and gentleman. It wasn't really a fresh idea, so, it wasn't enough to save the comic, but this movie sure makes it shine. Really good design and costumes, everybody's favorite gentleman Colin Firth, fantastic soundtrack by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson (one of those that'll stay with you forever, like Terminator, or Tim Burton's Batman themes)... The movie just nailed. As for what was fixed... well, the story. The story was fixed. Because there's no way to become good with guns while playing Call of Duty. Obviously. So, now we have proper training and other special agent stuff.Can't say that the story is very good, though. It's actually pretty generic. Thankfully, small details and memorable quotes help a lot. Movie makers also understood that it was bad idea to make it to much like James Bond. So, they came with the idea to make it a little bit... dirty. Well, more than a bit, actually. While being old school, I totally hated some scenes here, while the others were way too controversial (like the one in a church). But dirty jokes and controversial stuff is pretty much what makes this movie different from typical spy movies, so... like it, or not, it can't be different.So... yeah. It's dirty, it's totally controversial, but... it's better than the original comic. Way, WAY better. The story may still be a bit generic, but at least it isn't as poor as in the comic and music, costumes, actors and other things sure help a lot. If dirty jokes are your thing, then it's your movie. But the best thing about Kingsman is that it can provide a lot of things aside from those. Unlike the comic, you won't forget this one after you'll finish with it. And that's more than you can actually ask from most of the modern movies."
" Too sexist

I also resent the cliche with the woman being from Scandinavia, which reinforces the false image of women from these countries being ""easy"".

Quite a few people don't like it because it's extremely violent but it has an R rating for a reason. Vaughn's style of action scenes work so well for this movie. They're chaotic, have unique camera angles and movements that focus on what's most important in a scene and they don't just use the whole one punch changes to a different shot that Hollywood loves so much which makes it very refreshing. It's a very, well, ""British movie"" with British humour and slang that I'm surprised most Americans can understand. The soundtrack is incredible as well, Manners Maketh Man might be my favourite track. The movie can get a little silly at times but it's a comic book movie so I can't really nag it for that. The movie clearly isn't meant to be taken seriously and I like that. It's refreshing to have a movie for once that is made to be fun and not just action with dark settings and occasional humour. Highly recommend this. Too bad the sequel is an absolute mess."

Somebody do Taron Egerton a favour and quietly suggest to him that he finds another vocation because he is hopeless as an actor. Stupid dialogue and over the top graphic violence. Very relieved I didn't pay good money to see this in a theatre. Kept hoping it would get better but just got sillier as it went on, ending in a puerile scene with the 'hero' getting his reward in the back alley."
" A Really Silly Movie Worth Watching Again
",0.3729,-0.9939,2018-03-09 00:00:00,10,"""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" was produced in 2014 in the United Kingdom, and is a movie roughly based on the hit series of the famous movie spy, James Bond. The Kingsman functions much like MI6, except they have the highest level of clearence in the world, giving them the ultimate control in security and survalliance. There are two movies in the series, and I will write about the first one, ""The Secret Service."" The main plot is that one of the main agents for kingsman, Harry, is looking for a new recruit to undergo traiyning and become a new kingsman agent. He stumbles across a young man named Eggsy, who was a free sprit constantly getting into trouble with the law, and selects him as his choice to put through training with other students that other agents have selected. They go through many difficult trails, testing their ability to think outside the box and work together as well as testing their bravery. In the final test, Eggsy and another finalist, Roxy, were forced to shoot a dog that they had been given in the beginning of the test, and had trained and built a bond with. Eggsy couldn't do it, but roxy did and became an agent. After their test, they both found out that their guns were loaded with blanks. All the while, the main super villain of the movie, Vallentine, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, had a notorious scheme to install SIM cards that could control peoples minds. He did this by giving his SIM cards out for free, and gave everyone free internet connection. He eventually gathered his friends and world leaders to participate in his plot to destroy the world of everyone but them so they could create a new world order, and control the world together. His SIM cards could control people to kill each other. After finding out about this plot, the kingsman decided that they would stop Valentine from carrying out his plot, and infiltrated his headquarters to sneak in and try to kill him. Rosy would be sent up in a weather balloon to shoot a missile at Valentines satellite to stop the SIM Valentine realized that someone in his party would try to kill him. They were all trying to avenge for Harry's death, as he went to a white supremacist church to try and get to Valentine, but was shot in the head by valentine after his SIM card in his phone caused him to kill everyone in the church. Eggsy finally killed Valentine after a long battle, and made the heads of all of valentines party to explode. When scrolling through the user reviews on IMDb for the movie Kingsman, there are a plethora of low rating negative reviews. The negative reviews all had a few common points which ruined the movie for them. They say that there is too much violence, with masses of people being killed without much thought, and filmed in a way to garner laughter and appreciation. One reviewer even said that they took their entire family to watch it, and were traumatized by it. My question is: why would a mother bring her entire family to watch a rated R British spy movie? This genre of movie is basically all about the spying, training, and killing of enemies. It is not for everyone, but it does nothing wrong and more than fufills the expectations of this genre of movie. I feel that this movie is worth watching because it is really funny, and has a really good story that makes you feel connected with the characters and the plot. If you enjoy a spy theme like James Bond, then you will really enjoy this movie. This movie is rated R, with a lot of explicit language, gruesome killing scenes, and some partial nudity at the end which you will want to shield your eyes from. Even though the story line seems quite shallow, boring, and predictable, the producers have added so many different details and graphics that make the whole movie really funny and memorable. What other movie has criminals' heads exploding in rainbow clouds and secret agents in immaculate suits? This movie is worth the hype, and I thoroughly recommend watching it."
" Very Entertaining.
",0.4927,0.928,2018-03-02 00:00:00,6,"I've never read the comics and I was never a fan of Colin Firth, but Kingsman isn't bad at all. An awful lot of people in the reviews that I've read are comparing this to Bond. In my opinion you can't compare them, they're to different . The film has plenty of action, great fight scenes,Firth is excellent. The story does start to fall apart a bit around the last half hour of the movie , it was like the script writers tried to inject a lot of humour and they ended up overdoing it. The main villain I thought was weak,and the movie does suffer to an extent for these reasons. Still, kingsman is enjoyable if you don't mind over the top action, and if you just take it for what it is, you'll like it."

" One of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen
",0.4927,0.9855,2018-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is an action packed and hilariously entertaining film that everyone should see. It follows the classic spy movie formula but still manages to be original with self-awareness and subverting clich√©s. It's extremely gory at times, but it portrays the violence with good taste. The performances from the main actors are impressive. Taron Egerton as the likable protagonist, Eggsy, is perfect, especially for a newcomer, Colin Firth brings his usual charm to his performance and Samuel L. Jackson plays the extremely entertaining and hilarious villain, Valentine, accompanied by his badass henchwoman Gazelle, portrayed by Sofia Boutella, who has prosthetic blades instead of legs which she uses in her epic fight scenes. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the clasic spy genre"
" Move over, James Bond, you've got company.
",0.0,0.8836,2018-02-04 00:00:00,9,"With how stupidly long the 007 series has been running, I finally decided to move on to another series. Here's the thing about spy/secret agent gone humorous/sexy movies. It's an old fashioned idea and an acquired taste. The morals are old school, the plots are old school, the ideas are old school, everything is old school but it doesn't mean those who decided to produce those kinds of movies can't put their own spins on them.Kingsman is the perfect example of that kind of movie. The plot gets your attention, the dialogue is witty, and the dull moments always turn sexy. That's how it's supposed to be. It's about the macho, bad@$$ dude with some confidence in himself with women and courage in the face of danger no matter how realistic the idea is or not. Kingsman just took it to a whole new level and taking the gamble with not very well known actors payed off well. It was, in my book, the best film of 2014."

 Could have Eggsy's part been better played by anyone else, may well have... Samuel L Jackson as a comic villain just about does an okay job. Initial fight scenes were classy, a touch of Tarantino I find there, the church scene was great, but the action sequences towards the end by Eggsy were more video-gamish, the CGI was pretty bad there.

" Surprisingly bad given the cast and budget
",-0.3182,-0.0525,2018-01-07 00:00:00,2,"Another of those movies I am glad I did not waste my money on (saw it on ITV last night) and if I had not had the flu and needed something to do to while away a couple of hours I would resent the waste of the time.
Where to begin to try to make sense of the mess that it all seemed to me. Having also seen Spectre last weekend (again thanks ITV) comparisons are inevitable. Sadly, the Kingsman comes nowhere close either as some kind of comic book to film parody or attempt to ""re-invent"" this long-established genre (that does not need it on the strength of Spectre). 
Others have picked out the worst excesses of this movie so no need to repeat them here suffice to say none of these I found entertaining - and after all, is that not the point of a movie? And while it has extreme violence (yes, really off the scale) and f-bombs aplenty mostly c/o Samuel L, the only nudity was tacked on at the end in such a slipshod tawdry way I watched the credits in disbelief. 
The Bond films got it right more times than wrong, Kingsman never came close. Now there is a sequel but thanks to ITV I shall not be visiting the theatre to see that nor paying for a download. Do yourself a favour: instead of watching this travesty and insult to your intelligence, dig out an old Roger Moore Bond film and see a master at work."
" Very fun action comedy
",0.7474,0.9605,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Kingsman' is fun - it's a modern take on action/adventure save-the-world films and while it pays homage to the Bond films, it isn't a direct knock-off of them. The director Vaughn also ""rebooted"" superhero films recently ('X-Men: First Class' & 'Kick Ass') and is helped ably by this film being based on another Mark Millar (Wanted, Kick Ass, Secret Service) graphic novel, which means you're guaranteed excessive violence and unexpected plot twists. I hope they keep turning his graphic novels into films!Like any good spy movie, it starts with a ridiculous 'evil genius' - Valentine (Jackson, with a hilarious lisp & wardrobe) - plan: use a neurotransmitter to make people homicidally violent and wipe out the majority of the human race to save the planet from climate change. Then comes the secret spy agency that no government even knows about - the Kingsmen, led by Arthur (Caine). Their top agent Galahad/Harry (Firth, great to see him playing against type) who recruits Eggsy (newcomer Egerton) and we get to see him go through trials until he becomes a ""gentleman Kingsman"". Some very nice suits, gadgetry and locations are used to impress that ""manners maketh the man"". There are quite a few differences between the film and the graphic novel, but they don't detract from what is a simple, well-made, fast-paced action film, with plenty of wit and comedy thrown in for good measure. All the actors are great and Jackson seems to relish being the crazy villain. I hope there's sequels to follow! The 'fireworks' scene at the end is exceptional & hilarious. Also - only nine months until we get to see Mark Hamill again!"
" Entertaining (and shallow) as hell
",-0.4019,0.8802,2017-12-26 00:00:00,6,"Entertaining as hell. Nothing especially new (unlikely heroes, amazing secret clubs, super slow mo sequences, self referential jokes), but all the old tricks were used well at least. Would have loved a more diverse cast, but I suppose aristocratic British tailors are limited as protagonists."
" Better than any James Bond movie if you ask me
",0.4404,0.9846,2017-12-14 00:00:00,8,"After watching Kingsman: The Secret Service I was very surprised I never heard about this movie before. When a James Bond movie comes out you can't see enough commercials about it. That this movie is inspired on the James Bond stories there is no doubt about that. But to me the difference with the OO7 movies and Kingsman is that Kingsman is just better. I really enjoyed this movie even though it was a quite long movie. There are no boring moments, there are plenty of well done action scenes, the special effects make it all look real, and the special spy gadgets are ingenious. I thought Kingsman was better than a James Bond because of the dialogues, the story, and the acting. While in any James Bond movie you always have moments that you think it's way over the top and that it's obvious OO7 will easily win the battle with Kingsman I didn't have that feeling. And while in a James Bond movie they explicitely look at their language in Kingsman it's all a bit rougher and closer to daily life. Colin Firth is always good to watch but also Taron Egerton that plays Eggsy, one of the main characters. I still can't believe I only watched this movie three year after it came out. I just saw there was another one and that will be the next movie I will watch."

Put aside the ridiculous premise of a tailorshop gone rogue and starting a world beating organisation. Put aside the new world order storyline and sky- high tech...This is basically a tale of the underdog reinventing himself and coming out on top... And coming out in a style so sublimely absurd that you can't help but shout ""Fuck yeah!"" and cheer out loud.And nobody does it better than the Brits with their understated humour and disturbing, twisted ability to turn surreal violence into an art form on the silver screen.This is more akin to a modern take on Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with its stylised, refined and idealistically filtered view of justice laced with a dry humour so sharp that one could literally be cut in two... or die of thirst.As another reviewer said, ""This has a real chance of becoming iconic."" and I believe she's on to something there."
" Action Adventure Spy Movie to the Next Level
",0.3182,0.9916,2017-12-04 00:00:00,10,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is the next awesome spy movie that is very alike to the James Bond movies, but in a action/comedy humor way. I was very amazed by how the cast was made to have the actors portray the characters they were casted as in the movie. Honestly,Taron Egerton did an outstanding job portraying his character Eggsy Unwin (who is a teenage boy from the streets to the agency of Kingsman) and he learns the way of Kingsman from his mentor Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Eggsy and Harry come along very well in this movie. As well as seeing Samuel L. Jackson portray as a bad guy which his name is Valentine, I was in wow by how well Samuel L. Jackson did in portraying this certain villain throughout the movie. This was my very first time seeing Samuel playing a bad guy. Overall, I enjoyed Kingsman: The Secret Service and my favorite quote from this movie is ""Manners Maketh Man"". This is a one-of-a-kind spy movie that makes me want to watch all over and over again. It's a fun, action-packed thrill ride that everyone will enjoy."
" Good Brit fun action movie
",0.7351,-0.9197,2017-12-02 00:00:00,7,"This is a fun Brit movie. Doesn't take it self too seriously for an espionage movie. The Kingsman organization is a very old secret service and we follow a new recruit as he tries to make the grade with Colin Firth as his bad ass mentor who provides lots of kill thrills. Samuel Jackson is the worst villain in movie history. His lisp and sideways baseball cap is totally ridiculous and he is totally not believable in his roll as the evil anti-hero. And there is no explanation why an American black man is in this British film to begin with. The only explanation that I can think of is it is only to satisfy the film industry's liberal diversity quota. Would have enjoyed it more had they not chosen that path. If Samuel Jackson is in the sequel I probably won't be interested to in watching it. Not because of Samuel Jackson, who is a fine actor, but because he sucks at being a villain and I'm not into racial diversity quotas in movies."
" Action,comedy,special effects and fresh faces to boot!
",0.3802,0.8965,2017-11-21 00:00:00,10,"A James Bond type action film with doses of comedic relief Kingsmen really blew me away! Funny thing about these ""ultra-violent"" yet comedic movies they either get a 9 or 10 or a 1 or 0 (either love em' or hate em') There is no middle ground in a movie like this. People that abhor gratuitous violence should not view these type of films. To me it's more intriguing to see something that repulses people than a movie that gets a 5 or 6 rating. I say HOORAY!! for all those who gave the KINGSMEN the rating it deserves (9-10) And for all those who panned it with a 1 stick to what you know and like. Boring drama. Colin Firth was absolutely brilliant as was ""Eggsy"" I never wrote a review before so this is a statement not only about this film but people's attitudes in general. Thank you."
" Let down by lazy scriptwriting
",-0.3612,-0.926,2017-11-18 00:00:00,1,"A potentially good movie ruined by outdated attitudes and excessive violence. Whilst James Bond movies, it could be argued, have evolved over the years to become less sexist and offensive, it's as if the writers of Kingsman thought that was a bad thing and have rewound time to make the most offensive and sexist Bond type movie they could imagine. It's a shame because the actors are good, the effects are good, the gadgets are cool, but the attitudes are archaic. I'd like to see Jane Goldman and the other writers use more intelligent writing, but instead they lazily lean back on sex, violence and offensive language to prop up their weak scriptwriting. Bits of the movie are awesome, sadly it's let down by poor scriptwriting."

And as every spy movie,it comes with a bad guy that has an evil plot to destroy the world and in this one the evil plot it's brilliant.Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain named Richmond Valentine, and the villain plan was to offer everyone in the world Sim cards that grant free lifetime cellular and Internet connectivity. But what the people don't know is that those Sim card can trigger a signal that causes them to become murderously violent and start killing each other. Another thing that I found it worked pretty good with the movie was the humor. Even though most of the spy movies have a serious tone and a few subtle jokes,this movie was the opposite,it was full of funny moments and jokes that blend well with the movie. Overall,the movie was,as I said in my summary,one of the best spy movies if not the best."

I can't think of any other film off the top of my head which as polarising, but I side fully with the critics on this one.I'd already read the graphic novel many years back, and wasn't a fan but still believed it could make a fun film. This film takes the humour, and is basically spy film in the Kick-Ass mould, but it doesn't work for me. I just couldn't find myself interested in the characters, albeit excepting the two acted by Colin Firth and Sofia Boutella, and if anything it was too much of a parody.It's a fine line when you make a parody to go too far and lose interest, and that for me happens here. There's clich√© and so on, but the worst part is Samuel L Jackson as the villain, who really has his worst performance and role I've yet seen from him, didn't even need to make an effort.The action scenes are excellent, I'll give them that, and like Kick-Ass they are very violent. That's the only interesting point for me.I'll leave it at that. Maybe worth watching if on the TV on a Saturday or Sunday night, otherwise give a miss.

The only thing that bothered me about the cast is Taron Edgerton, he's not leading man material and not really that good of an actor.Watching both films recently, I was a bit confused about the Kingsman and how they were funded, given that in the second movie, the Statesmen were entirely funded by a whiskey company. So upon rewatching the first movie, I hadn't realized that this whole ludicrous outfit was being funded, legitimately, by tailors making suits.REALLY?So yeah, for some reason, instead of trying to profit as much as possible, the Kingsman run a vigilante operation that operates under the pretenses of patriotism and always serves the country and the greater good? Really? There are also numerous times that events in the first film contradict what is going on in the second film, and at times, within the same movie itself.The message of the comic/movie from Mark Millar is rather clear; private industry is better than the government at doing its job, and not corrupt. I just don't get it. It's just one of those movies that really shouldn't be thought about too much, otherwise, you'll realize how stupid it is underneath it all.I don't know."

" Smart satire enhances this stylistic, subversive and supremely entertaining spy homage to uproarious new heights; phenomenally fun film-making delivered with a wink and a nod.
",0.8934,0.9914,2017-09-29 00:00:00,10,"Not so much a spoof as a homage with some satirical elements, this uproariously entertaining and sharply witty action-comedy manages to meld together a number of differing genres without ever feeling like a mishmash, working best when it plays into or against the 'secret agent' tropes it so clearly adores. In fact, its occasional absurdity harks back to the days of Roger Moore's Bond. It's also important to note that the film stands on its own two feet as a brash and stylistically violent outlier within the genre. It does occasionally struggle to juggle its various elements, particularly during the second act as it tries to mesh its investigative spy plot with its initiate training sequences and maintain a consistent villainous presence (in the form of Samuel L. Jackson's brilliantly unique and understandable billionaire who's definitely the hero of his own story). The occasional extremely important expositional line pops up seemingly out of nowhere just before the plot needs to be propelled forward, while the passage of time is often unnaturally compressed to keep the pace compact. Thankfully, then, the third act is one of the best in recent years. It makes excellent use of escalating action and rising stakes, managing to introduce valid new threats each time it seems our heroes are successful, while always remaining a tense experience and never losing sight of it's slightly tongue-in-cheek tone. This is phenomenally fun film-making, the kind of slyly stylish cinema that knows what it is and who it aims to please. It's sure to leave you with a smile on your face. 10/10"
" Not your usual spy movie
",0.0,0.9204,2017-09-28 00:00:00,6,Kingsman the secret service is a movie filled with action violence comedy and so much more its not like James bond movies where most spy movie fans originated their love for the genre its unique and that's why i love it. Amazing performances from Colin Firth and Taren Egerton who was a new comer to Hollywood and this was his first movie. Sofia Boutella was great as Gazelle and the stand out performance was from Samuel L Jackson as the bad guy Valentine who was threatening and funny at the same time kinda like Dr Evil. Overall Kingsman the secret service was an amazing movie with the potential to do some amazing things and hopefully this series will grow.
" Review
",0.0,0.9889,2017-09-25 00:00:00,10,"As someone who is a huge fan of action movies, this is definitely one that i would watch over and over again. When the movie began I was hoping it was going to be another Quentin Tarantino type film. The story is of a young rebel, Eggsy, who is recruited to face multiple challenges in order to be welcomed into Kingsman. Colin Firth did a fabulous job as the mentor of Eggsy. He shows him the ropes and acts like the father that Eggsy lost as a child. All the action and fight scenes are so well choreographed and makes the whole movie on the edge of your seat hoping that none of the characters die or get injured. The shots remind me of ""Birdman"", many of the scenes (especially fight scenes) are filmed in one shot and it takes a long time to execute it. The director also made the lighting bright to show every move the characters were making. Another reason this movie does so well is the story line, the idea behind the story is very strange and different. I love when stories are wildly different. It is more intriguing to watch and learn what happens next. If there was an award to give for best cinematography and story, Kingsman: The Secret Service, should win every award. The writers were not afraid to be bold and the director knew hoe he wanted things filmed and how to show the life of a rebellious and young Eggsy become a fine spy from the teachings and life lessons from his mentor and step in father, Harry (Colin Firth). Personally, the film tops any Tarantino film. I would watch this every time it came on."
" Kingsman: The Secret Service Honest Review
",0.5106,0.8779,2017-09-25 00:00:00,8,Kingsman: The Secret Service itself is a far fetched theatrical plot that separates itself from modern day serious spy films by adding a spin on the action sequences and including some charming humour alongside a traditional but enjoyable plot line. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a breath of fresh air for the spy genre.
" Good fun, great movie
",0.8834,0.8171,2017-09-24 00:00:00,9,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a great popcorn movie with some stellar action, fun characters and a sense of humor that is just plain entertaining. There were a few minor bits that went a bit over the top, but they were few and far between. I'm looking forward to getting out and seeing the sequel and hope it's the start of a franchise that manages to avoid getting tired. I highly recommend Kingsman."
" Just awesome
",0.6249,0.9485,2017-09-24 00:00:00,8,"With the sequel ads playing on TV all the time, I had to go back and rewatch this. I love how this movie took everyone by surprise when it first came out. No one was expecting this to be as good as it was. The funny thing about this film is that it was never meant to have a sequel. I know, I know, it is based on a comic series but still, you can tell the director, producers and studio behind this thought it was going to be a nice little one shot moneymaker. They didn't expect it to blow up. Anyway this is an awesome movie. I don't expect much from the sequel so I'll wait until it comes on a smaller screen."
" Funny and action-packed spy film
",0.4404,-0.9957,2017-09-24 00:00:00,8,"The adaptation of Mark Millar's off-the-wall spy comedy came to life with comedy and action under the brilliant direction of Matthew Vaughn. The film begins with two prologues, one that shows the Kingsman spy group including Harry Hart (Colin Firth) aka Galahad and Merlin (Mark Strong) assaulting a terrorist spy group only to lose a member to a suicide bomber. Another agent Lancelot (Jack Davenport) completes his training during this mission but is killed in the second prologue seventeen years later on a mission in Argentina to save Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill). The deadly Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) sliced Lancelot in half at the behest of her boss Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who is afraid of blood and disgusted by violence. The recruiting process for a new Kingsman begins including the grown-up son of the agent that died years ago, Eggsy (Taron Egerton).Eggsy is a troublemaker living with his mom and her abusive boyfriend. He steals the car from thugs but ends up in jail needing help. He calls the number on a mysterious medallion and says ""Oxford, not brogues"". He's let out of prison and picked up by Harry who shows him his fighting skills in the pub when the same thugs try to bully Eggsy. Galahad recruits Eggsy into the new process by scaring off Eggsy's abusive stepfather using a microphone in a bug. At the Kingsman tailor shop, Harry shows Eggsy the potential of the secret service agency. Underground, Harry and Eggsy travel across England and Eggsy joins the recruiting process.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

" Not too bad at all
",0.431,-0.5303,2017-09-23 00:00:00,8,"OK, I need to chill out a bit and stop being too analyticalWhen it kinda seems to not fit into science fiction, then I tend to be more critical about what could happen in real life.This film is science fiction all day long and I should chill. I should let what happens in Marvel films happen in this. There is no difference.Perhaps its the Britishness of it all, and I am British. Colin Firth is so cool, I could put him in my whiskey glass.I've seen Mark Strong in better roles to be honest.The thugs in the gang in the pub don't seem realistic. Seem like nice boys really. Weird film all round from a casting point of view.A lot of the actors would be in some budget 20K British film foundation production. A lot of the actors would be in a 200M Hollywood production.Its that strange mix of actors that didn't fit for me.Perhaps I cant spot a crap American actor and I am just critical of British ones.I quite liked the Chav Eggsy who plays the main role really. Its kinda through his eyes. Its him you are routing for and I was, so it worked. That was a show stopper if I didn't get that, and I did.Forget the nay-sayers on the violence. They clearly haven't watched The Walking Dead lol. There is no violence in the film. Its acting people! Fake blood and CGI. No one really died. They took their pay cheque and payed the bills.I didn't get one thing and one thing only. At the end, when Eggsy is talking to the Swedish princess through the cell door, she makes him a promise which makes him promise to come back. I really don't get why that was left in. Didn't make any sense to the ""Bond gets the girl"" homage to 007. See what you think.Summary.I enjoyed it. I will watch the new one too. I think I was confused where it sat. Is it a Marvel film? Is it a James Bond spoof? Is it a James Bond genre? Is it a low budget British film.Thats where it didn't nail it for me."
" Chaotic, funny, fresh, action-packed and highly enjoyable!
",0.6689,0.9991,2017-09-22 00:00:00,8,"MATTHEW MAKETH FILM! For some one who grew up with Mr. Connery as 007: swaggering around with his Beretta, the iconic ladies man and never daring to swear, I went in to this film, more than a little skeptical but I am very happy to say that I was NOT LET DOWN AT ALL! Kingsman: The Secret Service is a hugely enjoyable ride and I was hooked from the word ""action"". Kingsman has a lot of the things we've come to expect from most modern-day films: explosive action, swearing, famous faces, end-of-the-world plans and so on, and though Kingsman does indeed have all those things, what it does is it keeps you gripped from the very start! Matthew Vaughn's directing on this giant project is brilliant! Choreographing huge, bloody and explosive actions scenes like the devastating Church massacre, end-of- the-world carnage or the NOW famous pub brawl! But as well as putting together some really brilliant action scenes, Vaughn also really gets the best out of his cast! Every member is on TOP FORM! Colin Firth delivers a brilliant, charismatic and highly enjoyable performance as Agent Harry Hart: a character totally different to what he's used to, and for those of you out there who think all Firth can do is act posh and wear a top hat, YOU ARE WRONG! Firth seriously gets in on the action! But enough about him, Taron Egerton delivers a very well-acted and authentic performance as Eggsy! Egerton plays the slightly yobbo chav very well but he also plays a character who cares deeply for his loved ones and knows the difference of right and wrong! The only criticism I have about Egerton's character (and this applies to the rest of the cast): and that is that there is rather too much swearing! Now I know the odd f*** and sh** is sometimes rather funny but the swearing in this film rather goes over the top and there were a few points where I wanted to say ""Oh wash your mouth-out!"" But this was all minor for a film that really delivered! Enjoyable, charismatic, funny and authentic performances from the whole cast! The great Mr. L Jackson is brilliant as the lisping megalomaniac and delivers the performance with real zest and really gets his inner Bond villain on! Very enjoyable performances from co-stars too! Strong is great and (as always) delivers a very strong performance! Authentic performances by Sofia Boutella, Sir Michael Caine and Jack Davenport as well. There is also a hilarious performance turned in by the great Mark Hamill. However, unfortunately his is more of a cameo but still very fun! The scenes are brilliantly acted out by everyone but obviously this is partly down to the script, courtesy of Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn himself! I can wholeheartedly say that the pair deliver a both funny, clever, and dramatic script! This film is more of a action-flick in terms of tension and can sometimes feel predictable but it still keeps you hooked from the very beginning! All these factors propel the film to it's finish, the cataclysmic world VS itself battle and though this is a devastating idea, it is very amusingly uplifted by the soundtrack of KC and the Sunshine band with ""Baby Give it Up""! So, like I've said: all these factors, combined together, produce a really enjoyable and pretty cool film! Obviously it has it's downs, (the swearing and it being more than a little smutty-the princess!) but I think that the good points, firmly out- weigh the bad! A real fun and fresh movie! Roll on the Golden Circle!"

Now unemployed & causing trouble, he finds himself joining the Kingsman to fight against evil destroying the world!The humour & bloody, violent elements you see which will remind you of that of Kick'Ass' 1-2 & Deadpool, were ace! The humour alone was simply awesome! The action sequences were epic as always & of course Samuel L Jackson's characters the villain was amazing! There were some dark parts going on in this film too!Overall, great action comedy film! 9/10"
" Really good film but bad supporting cast
",0.0507,0.9995,2017-09-22 00:00:00,8,"Kingsmen is a film filled with loads of funny jokes and great characters. The best thing about this film is how clever and stupid it seems to be. That may sound like a bad thing but let me explain. The film deviates from all spy films by having great jokes like a villain who is scared of blood and hero who is a wannabe gangster which makes it refreshing and clever. The stupidity comes from the ridiculous scenes that are a parody of spy thrillers like James Bond and the Bourne series. These parody scenes work so well with all the clever scenes and the self-awareness the film has with itself. The film follows spy movie conventions as there is a bad guy who wants to take over the world and the spy is sent to stop him from destroying earth with a virus of some kind. The bare bones are then layered with incredible characters and great, tasteful humour. All of the characters in this film are great and while I had some problems with the supporting cast I thought all of the main actors did a great job and portrayed good strong characters that all contribute to the plot and move it forward to a satisfactory conclusion. I think some honourable mentions go to what I would call ""the main guys""Colin Firth as Harry Hart is just such a great casting choice. He emulates a level headed spy who is just great at his job and fights with the class that the kingsmen agency is all about. Firth has not got a lot of comic lines but the action scenes he has are the best I have seen in a film in a long time. The ""manners maketh the man"" scene is brilliant and is so well choreographed that it is hands down the best action scene in the movie with the possible exception of the church scene. Taron Egerton who plays Eggsy is really good in this movie also. He plays a wannabe gangster really well and we see during the film how he changes into a man who understands that actions have consequences. He has a lot of joke lines in this film and they work in the film so well. Some movies, like Ghostbusters 2016 will stop the plot to tell a joke however this movie has the right flow and a good quality script so that the plot is intertwined with the jokes. Egerton does a good job of acting like a chav turned spy would act. Samuel L Jackson as Valentine makes this movie for me. Having a villain who is grossed out by blood and violence is an inspired idea and Jackson does great work in this film and actually gave a sh^t about the character he was playing. Valentine has a legitimate reason for killing the population as he is worried about man's effect on the environment and has to save the planet by culling the population. This bit in the plot smells a little bit like Dan Brown's Inferno to be quite honest.However you soon get over that by how goofy and charismatic Valentine is, with his lisp and his love of McDonalds coupled with a good Dom Perignon to go along with it. The jokes that he has are masterful and I love how he remarks (in the film) that this is not an ordinary spy film. Honestly I think Valentine is the best character in the film.The supporting characters like Eggsy's mom and the drunk, abusive stepdad are the worst characters in the film. Chiefly because the actors playing them can't act and are very wooden in their performances. Even when the stepdad is being all manipulative and controlling the mom you never really believe in the performances they give and it adds such a different and violently sad tone to this movie that I actually wished they had not had so much screen time. Their parts you can just ignore anyway so it doesn't completely ruin the film but it does take you out of it due to their unrealistic and boring performances. From a technical point of view I think the movie works well with a lot of great camera work creating some good visuals and decent CGI. There was CGI blood which is never done realistically and in this film there are BAD CG blood moments but they didn't take me out of the film a lot and did not make me enjoy the action sequences any less. There were some bad camera panning where the camera would pan up and then to the right to show movement of characters from one place to another scene. However this was not used a lot and I can only think it was used in the train scene where Eggsy and Harry go to kingsmen headquarters. The music in this is used very well as a way of making the audience feel and adding emotion to a scene that needs a little umph. There are some great songs used in this movie and they all make sense in the points of the plot that they are used so well done whoever was in charge of sound in this film. All in all this film does have a few flaws and bad actors and crap CG blood use but its good points are really good. Great characters and great humour make this a film worth seeing and I advise you to go see it on DVD or download. It is worth it."
" A nice and bloody flick
",-0.0258,0.9862,2017-09-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie does not hold back on the blood at all and violence. So if that is something you don't like to see, I would suggest that you skip put on this one. Now that out of the way, I will continue and get to the real review. The acting was pretty solid and there was no real performance that I purely disliked. The story while not really the best in the world was still good or at least decent enough to keep me interested. The weak story is the thing that drags this down a couple of points. But I like the characters and the bond the characters all have. It felt real to me, especially with Eggsy and his mentors. I also think the final thirty minutes or so were some great action packed thrills and it did leave me in suspense. The final mid credits scene was pretty good as well, would suggest watching that if you see the movie. Short and generic review but just wanted to get my initial thoughts down: Not a bad movie, not a great one either. But a good one and that is what matters. I would suggest checking it out once or twice."
" More Austin Powers than James Bond
",0.0,0.9387,2017-09-20 00:00:00,5,"Some people may assume the title of this review is an insult, but I would say there are equal parts positive and negative in this. Bond has become a laboured, sombre affair in recent years and though those films are still a quality product there is little fun to be had. Step in Kingsman - a high-octane, largely brainless British spy film that might lack the grit of Bond, but is infinitely more enjoyable. I watched this film with a perpetual grimace of disapproval at the clich√©-riddled plot (a global super-villain with a lair; the protagonist being unusually proficient at driving and parkour before any of his training, despite being a no-hoper street youth; the mentor fast-tracking the prot√©g√© into a role of prominence against the odds etc...) yet... I carried on watching. I wanted to see what happened next despite the lack of originality because the film is paced well and holds your attention. The fight scenes are unnecessarily slow-motioned almost to a point of bending time infinitely, but they are also violent in a way many films are afraid to be for fear of bumping up their certificate and infringing on the profit margin. The Austin Powers ridiculousness of this movie was cemented in the closing minutes as Eggsy is rewarded for his heroics with the chance to engage in anal sex with a princess while Mark Strong has to watch and keep the engine running. Yep, that actually happens... but in fairness, it actually makes the rest of the film seem palatable in hindsight."
" Engaging hilarious riot
",0.128,-0.7927,2017-09-16 00:00:00,9,"Maybe it helped to have been raised in a British media sphere to recognise the clich√©s from sixties British TV and films; but sent up, parodied, twisted and subverted. I began with no expectations other than the information in the title: Kingsman, the secret service. The hero faces a series of selection challenges, a theme as old as storytelling. His motivations are as obscure as the motivations of the Bondian villain are improbable, the material culture of the villains HQ is pure sixties Broccoli, but the means of communication are up to date. I'm not sure the plot makes any sense- that doesn't matter as we are propelled from illusion to crisis every minute. The hero receives ambiguous off-hand help from a mentor, but no discernible training before he's put to work. The film is certainly amoral, even anarchic. The Kingsman organisation is an independently funded secret service, with no governmental or democratic oversight. Violence is extreme and cartoonish cf Tom and Gerry, the mores of political correctness are not observed. Most of the cast are dead by the end. The hero does get the girl ( to the tune of 'Slave to Love'), though not the one you expected, another confounded expectation. There is some bad taste here and there. But there are values- and not bad ones for this age of lost boys-wear a suit and tie, have a polite manner, accept some help from 'old people', take a little instruction; and your mother might yet be proud of you. There's a sleazy mendacious Michael Caine, and Colin Firth ( still better known in the UK as 'Mr Darcy') does the unthinkable ( and I don't want to spoil that). And the torch has been passed to a new generation. It probably didn't get many Oscars- there's not much angst here about the American condition- but there's a pastiche of modern Merry England, and that scene in the church. Two hours approx of escapism. Enjoy."
" Chill out, it's all been done before and better,
",0.4404,0.9703,2017-09-14 00:00:00,4,"Same script, different cast. I'm not sure why this film is so highly rated, I mean it had its moments and an attractive cast but haven't we seen it all before? I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars because it could have easily been 5 out of 5 if they'd just toned down the unnecessary ""purge' violence and nonsensical objectification of the female characters. A princess is held against her will and promises sexual favours to a random guy who happens to just be by her cell and promises to open it as soon as he saves the world? Yeah right, Hollywood misogynists, go kick rocks. Better luck with part 2, which hits theatres in a few days."
" Saviour of the Spy Genre
",0.0,0.9827,2017-09-13 00:00:00,10,"I've watched Kingsman: The Secret Service many times since it's release in 2014, and not once have I ever thought it deserves less than 10 stars. In a world filled with films that just end up following numerous tropes and becoming overdone, Kingsman is a refreshing film that reminds us just watch spy films are meant to be.We follow the story of Eggsy, a young man with an abusive stepdad, who loves his mother more than anything. After getting into trouble with the police, he is signed up to undergo training to become a possible Kingsman, a gentleman spy ring. At the same time, the world's new criminal mastermind is just starting to unveil his new plot to take over the world.I think the first thing about this film to note is the humour. It's absolutely spot on. It really captures British humour and shows what we're about. There was nothing that didn't fit right into the movie and the feeling of it, and everything flowed along brilliantly.The second thing, is definitely the cinematography; especially during the fight scenes. George Richmond did an absolutely amazing job, and I'm very interested, just from the church fight scene, to have a look at other films he has done cinematography for. He has a real talent for it, and it definitely made Kingsman even better. The acting on everyone's part was absolutely brilliant. It's obvious that everyone put a lot of work into their roles, and with legends such as Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth it's not hard to see why the acting quality is so high. With breakthroughs actors Taron Egerton (Eggsy) and Sophie Cookson (Roxy), Kingsman proves high on its casting quality and Reg Poerscout-Edgerton did an amazing job. With such films as Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron and The Man from U.N.C.L.E under his belt, it's not hard to see why he was picked for the job.At the end of the day this is a gory, wonderful new retake on the spy genre, and it does absolute wonders. With humour to suit most people, a heart breaking underlying story line, and a massive villain with an up to date way to take over the world, Kingsman proves itself in every aspect of film making, and is a blessing to the cinematic world."

" Warm-hearted action comedy
",0.3612,0.9478,2017-09-12 00:00:00,6,"KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is very much a kindred spirit to KICK-ASS, doing for the spy genre what KICK-ASS did for comic books. It's a light and breezy affair, a film which never takes itself too seriously, involving British spies battling a megalomaniac bent on world domination. Taron Egerton suffers from being an unlikeably 'street' character for a lot of the running time, and some of the humour is a little crude for my tastes, but otherwise this is a film which hits the ground running with a heady mix of comedy, action, and genre tropes.The story is ludicrous and a deliberate throwback to '60s cinema. Samuel L. Jackson hams it up a storm as the baddie while it's fun to see Colin Firth playing something other than the slightly stuff romantic figure he always reverts to. Where KINGSMAN excels is in the violent action scenes, which play up brief snippets of outrageousness and feature far better choreography than expected. The church fight is the undoubted highlight, but the large-scale action of the climax is well staged too. CGI is used extensively, but works for the most part. I may not be running out to see the sequel anytime soon, but I'll definitely give it a watch at some point."

The first few reviews I read raved about this movie so much that I thought maybe it is me being out of touch. However in continuing reading the reviews I see that the majority of reviewers were appalled at this garbage which really does cast a serious doubt on the validity of IMDb's rating system.

" The thought provoking spy flick with a heartbreaking story about complex characters and corrupt governmental agencies. Well, that ain't that kind of movie.
",-0.4019,0.9771,2017-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a delightful surprise, the movie that had everything to be just a generic spy flick turned out to be one of the best action movies of 2015. Whether you take it as a parody or as a homage, Kingsman is great at both, it combines everything that made the genre so good into a very unique piece of entertainment, the gadgets, the megalomaniac villains, the badass fight scenes, it's the kind of movie that is so fun that you just don't want it to end.Regarding the technical aspect, the movie is style from beginning to end. The directing is amazing, I thought Matthew Vaughn was great in X-Men: First Class, but here, he's much more free to do what he wants to do, and it gives the movie a really exotic look (you'll remember the church scene). The cast is excellent, there is not even a single miscast here, Colin Firth is excellent, so are Samuel L Jackson and Taron Egerton.Perhaps Kingsman is not a movie for everyone, it might be too silly for some, too violent for others, or even offensive for those who are not used to the dark humor used here. But if you're tired of the new spy movies that just want to be serious and dramatic, and miss the old ones, that just wanted to be fun, give Kingsman a shot and you won't regret it."
" Violent, gory and just plain fun.
",-0.1531,0.9982,2017-09-02 00:00:00,10,"For someone who has never even heard of the Kingsman comic let alone seen the movie, I was unsure about what I would get when I sat down to watch Kingsman: The Secret Service. Well, mark my words when I say that this movie straight up rocks! From it's fast-paced action and wit to it's homages and mockery of the spy movie genre, this is everything that the modern James Bond movies wished they could be.The movie begins in 1997 where a secret agent named Lee Unwin loses his life to protect his team during a raid. After that, the squad leader Harry Hart gives a medal to the Unwin's widow and her son. 17 years later, a professor is abducted by humanitarian Richmond Valentine while one of Hart's fellow agents code-named ""Lancelot"" tries a rescue only to be killed by Valentine's henchwoman. We then cut to Garry ""Eggsy"" Unwin living with his mother and stepfather and while he is an smart and gifted young man, he lives the life of a common theft. After being arrested for car theft, Garry is freed and seeing potential in the boy, Hart takes him under his wing to become a Kingman. Now, Eggsy must complete his training and stop Valentine from ending humanity.With the overabundance of comic book films in the last few years, some have fallen into the pit of trying to be too somber or brooding, however where Matthew Vaughn's foresight rests on and what his previous comic-book movies have proved so far is that they walk a fine line to where the tension and solemn character moments conclude and the parody and comedy take over, leaving a distinctive action film that manages to stand out from the watered-down bloodless action films that keep getting released. Kingsman is a movie that's completely unmatched and its own thing while wholly adopting its English cultural roots, even the marketing for the movie takes cues from the Bond films. As Kingsman is an out of the ordinary movie, it works within the context of the spy movie genre by itself but also it takes jabs at spy movies and their clich√©s that it could be seen as a comedy/spoof much like the Austin Powers films, but personally I see the movie as a complimentary tribute to the genre. The best example of this in the movie is during the cabin fight sequence where there is a jug of whiskey, several men are killed and not a drop of whiskey has been spilled and then Lancelot shoots his fingers at the past and say that they are the future, a perfect homage to the genre. Also, Kingsman mixes the appeal of spy films such as the bizarre gadgets, the exaggerated villain, and the aristocratic spy with new ideas and it does so perfectly while also breathing new life into a genre that has gotten way too serious over the last few years and it's so energizing to watch a movie that isn't nervous to have some fun or make some jokes as opposed to some recent action movies.The way the film is shot is some of the finest I've seen in any action movie and the cinematography is truly eloquent but without the quick cuts and shaky cam that continue to plague modern action films and is mostly done in one shot which gives the movie a bit of fluidity. Of course a great spy movie is nothing without a lot of gory action and Kingsman delivers that in spades and the over-the top violence is one of the movie's largest selling points, now I personally don't care for extreme violence in movies just for the sake of having it, but seeing somebody be killed in a movie without showing any blood or the ramifications of that action is an insult to the viewer and it dilutes their joy when watching the movie. Thankfully, Kingsman doesn't suffer from that which allows Vaughn to go all out with the action and gore and while there are plenty of stand-out action set pieces throughout the film such as a fight in a pub where Harry Hart knocks out several guys with an umbrella or at the end when Eggsy takes on Valentine's henchwoman, the crown jewel of the movie's action scenes is a scene where Harry is in a church where everything breaks loose and people go crazy and shooting commences, easily one of the most perfectly composed action set pieces in any action or comic book movie.Of course, a film of this caliber wouldn't have been as good had it not had a cast of great actors to play these characters, but Kingsman delivers that in spades and every actor plays their role to perfection. Sofia Boutella is deadly and outrageously exciting as the iron leg wearing henchwoman Gazelle. Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as the villainous Richmond Valentine and has the right amount of stagecraft to him and yet manages to be quite witty at the same time with his lisp and loathing for blood. Mark Strong is engaging and reliable as Merlin and makes the role even better with his Scottish accent. Sophie Cookson is wonderful as Roxy, however it's Taron Egerton who is the breakout star of the movie and he is incredibly appealing, enduring and downright hilarious and yet still stays true to who his character is and has jokes for every circumstance, but Collin Firth nearly steals the entire movie as Harry Hart which given his knack for playing serious roles, would come across strange but Firth is so wonderful as a cultured spy and it's so energizing and enjoyable to see Collin step out of his serious acting shoes and play a more vibrant character and rounding out the cast is the always wonderful Michael Cane as Arthur.I can't praise Kingsman enough, it's just a total blast to watch. Go watch it already!"

It has a core problem of having the main villain seek to destroy the world, which makes the ending quite predictable. However the most grievous error was the misuse of the amazing actors Mark Hamill and Michael Caine, which were in smaller roles that didn't take advantage of their unique strengths. In short it's enjoyable, however has a fundamental flaw in the predictability of the story and misuse of actors."

Modern movies sometimes have a weak part of irritating clich√©. However, in this movie, I noticed that it makes the clich√© it's strong part. Not only pointing it out directly, but in making things remarkably unique.I really love movies where there is something unfinished left at the end and it is being solved with style, and that smug feeling in the viewers eyes. This movie did it twice!However, I missed some deeper characterization of the main roles. It took so long for her to make that jump. They could've took that further later in the movie.

In particular were gay marriage and abortion. Of the two it was the abortion issue that was the worst.Imagine a bunch of impressionable kids going down to the movie theater and suddenly having this propaganda that, regardless of the extreme absurdity of the script, it's meritorious to kill pro-life advocates - I can assure you that was the intent of both the director/writer Martin Vaughn and the co-writer Jane Goldman.It never ceases to amaze me those who advocate this barbarity (abortion) never ask themselves where they would be had their mother elected to abort them - no that's never in the discussion.Firth must need the money or he's another lost soul heading for an eternity of eternal regret. Even sadder was watching Michael Caine who in the original 'Alfie', which he starred in way back in 1966, at that pivotal scene he (Caine) comes face-to-face what he has forced upon his girl friend Gilda, played by Julia Foster, an abortion and the honesty in Caien's/Alfie's face as he considers the evil of the act.Now it's fast forward to 2014 a mere 48 years later and oh man is Michael Caine cool as a cucumber in this mess."

" Best Spy movie in a while
",0.6369,0.9928,2017-07-14 00:00:00,9,"I was very surprised how much this director expanded the 6 issues material to a quite extraordinary film.We have the toys,we have the villain,we have the mentor figure and we have the lead,all pieces falling perfectly into place to form a Kingsman's journey to success.Eggsy's life and growth are meant to reflect our lives and our continuous evolution and strife to be better.He had a tragic childhood,losing his father,her mother replacing him with some unworthy suitor she found,probably to provide safety to her family.Despite the life he is inspired to lead in spite of his new father,Galahad takes him under his wing and proposes him to be the next Lancelot,a recent Kingsman who died on the field,in honor of his former student,Eggsy's dad sacrifice for his team.Despite not passing the final test,after his mentor's death he takes the responsibility of stopping Valentine.What I particularly liked is that he came up with the solution which got them out of an almost deadly spot even if I expected Galahad to come back and save the day.This movie does well on shading light and giving the deserved spot to their main character without undermining the journey and grooming his qualities which he uses in the last arc of the ingenuity,combat training,wisdom,quick thinking,efficiency and wit.His best quality,in the end remains his good heart which kept him on the right path all along,a good example being that he did not want to shoot the dog or that he wanted everyone to be safe on the parachute test.Valentine,played by Samuel L.Jackson is a great villain for me,because he doesn't want to take over the world,kill millions of people,he just wants to provide a mean to diminish the population of the planet so that certain individuals can adapt better and survive more safely.Like every villain he corrupts the politicians of the world to be on his side but unlike some he also uses the hero to test his device,Galahad,who killed everyone in the Church,then kills him without revealing anything.I liked that he takes precautions with the explosive chip inserted in the neck,showing his suspicion. Despite being a maniac for a good cause,what is funny about him is his homophobia to some degree.The minor characters:Galahad,a well groomed,old Kingsman who hasn't lost any bit of his charm,who's mission is to groom the boy and in doing so repaying the debt to his father,is the mentor,who has to die for his student to take matters into his hands.Gazelle played by the charming Sofia Boutella,was the lover of Valentine,a keen,well trained assassin,who was Eggsy's ultimate test,being his shadow and an apprentice of her own who in the end failed killing the hero.Merlin as his Kingsman's name suggest is the ultimate support,always there to help,the right hand of this story's hero but also his teacher,the one who tested him,among others to see who is worth of a place at the ""Round Table"".This movie had an amazing,fitting soundtrack and great action sequences combined with good characters to form a great story and journey."

Kick ass scenes from Mr Firth (whom I was glad to see as a bad ass character). Amazing choreography for the fights, very classy and funny dialogues.

" Matthew Vaughn's James Bond Movie
",0.0,0.9969,2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"I think this is the fifth movie or so of Matthew Vaughn and he doesn't stops surprising me. With only four movies more, he has already made many different genres and he has show that he has a real ability of creating and filming. And this movie isn't less.It tells the story of Eggsy (Taron Egerton) a young unrefined boy who suddenly gets recruited by a ultra-secret spy agency called Kingsman, where is father had been working until he was killed. The story is very entertaining and it has some very funny moments that will keep you watching it. (For example the fireworks-head-blowing scene).Taron Egerton is a newcomer in here but he does it very well. He is able to introduce you in the world of Kingsman like a normal person would you (being like WTF is this?). Colin Firth as Harry Hart is also very good providing one of the most hardcore scenes of an action film in a long time (it involves a church from Kentucky). Samuel L Jackson as the villain Richmond Valentine was also great and very funny with his strange accent and his phobia to blood. And a special mention to Mark Strong, a usual collaborator in many Matthew Vaughn films, who here plays the role of Merlin, one of the main technicians of the Kingsman agency.The visuals were amazing. Matthew Vaughn is not afraid of showing blood when necessary, but not in a disgusting way, just making us have a good time and he truly delivers it. The scene of Eggsy infiltrating in Valentine's Lair or the pub fight with Harry at the beginning are one of the best action moments I have seen in a long time. And to this you have to add an amazing score created by Henry Jackman & Matthew Margeson, also frequent collaborators, who here create an epic, action-packed, heroic score, with parts with a clear homage to classic spy-action movies, like the pub fight music, as well as it is done in the rest of the movie.Matthew Vaughn does not stop surprising me and here delivers a very funny, entertaining, violent and crazy spy adventure that you won't regret watching it, I'm sure.""Manners Maketh Man"""
" Disappointing, miscast, predictable
",-0.4939,-0.8794,2017-05-22 00:00:00,4,"I did not like Kingsman Secret Service for a few reasons. First, they miscast Samuel L Jackson as the lead bad guy Mr Valentine. Second, he overplayed the character to such an outrageous degree that it just got sickening. Michael Caine was also miscast and misused. Need an old English guy who you think is good, or is he? Call Michael Caine who sleepwalked through this cash-grab role. Colin Firth was OK in his role, and his young apprentice Eggsy (silly name) was OK. Another reason to dislike this - the story was very predictable from start to end. there was no guessing about what was going to happen. Another reason to hate this film was the gore factor. There were so many frivolous blood shots and gore and hatchets and knives. It just went on and on till I just spaced out in disgust.I had high hopes for this flick. I expected a combination of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with a James Bond flair, or even Sky Captain. But instead this ended up looking like a poor version of the Matrix mixed with the worst Bond film mixed with Commando. It just sucked.The only bright spot was the lady killer who has a unique way of making her point with adversaries, just like Top Hat used to slice off heads with his bowler hat. Other than that, and mild intrigue, this movie was poor. I cannot believe there is a sequel coming out this summer. Good luck with that - pretty sure the bar will be pretty low based on this first mess of a film. Don't waste your time on this film."

But I love background stories, stories where guys are legends, someone who deserves to be remembered. Remember John Wick background story? Just like that.Acting was good, fight scenes even better, but Samuel L.

" Saving the World by Killing All of Its Inhabitants

However, he still holds onto a locket given to him as a young boy with an advisement to call an inscribed number if he ever needs serious help. So one day after fighting off some local bullies and being subsequently arrested for stealing the gang member's car he makes the call. To his surprise he is immediately released and the charges are all dropped. It's then that he learns that his father was a member of a clandestine organization in the British government known as the ""Kingsman"" and he is encouraged to join. However, it isn't nearly as easy to graduate from the program as he would like and he watches as the other people selected begin to drop out one by one. Meanwhile, a crazed billionaire by the name of ""Richmond Valentine"" (Samuel L. Jackson) who has come up with a plan to save the world from greenhouse gasses by killing almost all of the people who inhabit it. And with very few agents available to investigate Eggsy is called upon to help out before everything and everyone is killed. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting movie which raced from one exciting scene to the next in a very smooth manner. Unfortunately, the director (Matthew Vaughn) chose to take the low-road and utilized an over-abundance of vulgarity for the sake of some cheap laughs much too often. And most of it was simply unnecessary. In any event, this grew rather tiring after awhile and seriously limited the movie's overall appeal. But even so it was still entertaining to a certain degree and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."
" Kingsman: The Secret Service
",0.0,-0.791,2017-03-06 00:00:00,5,"'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is a comedy film that satirises spy movies such as the James Bond franchise. Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by Taron Egerton) is a normal working class 18 year old from London who gets recruited into a super secret spy organisation. Humour comes as he tries to mix with these posh and suave upper-class stereotypes.Matthew Vaughn has included his typical ultra stylised violence ('Kick Ass') and it does boast a good sound track. There are a lot of nods to films such as Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' but it just reminds me of examples when things have been done much better. The highlight of the film for me was a scene in which Colin Firth violently massacres a crazy church to the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd ('Free Bird') whilst almost seeming like a continuous long shot.The screenplay is very unoriginal and the dialogue with the young actors in particular is cringe-worthy. Tarantino type set-pieces just come across as annoying as the film fails to have any cleverness or creativity.Apart from Colin Firth every actor is either average or just really bad. Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, is worse than usual as he tries to add some freshness to his regular spiel by trying to affect an annoying and distracting speech impediment.'Kingsman' is going to appeal to the intended target age group as it does contain scenes of fantasy violence depicted as ""cool"" whilst characters swear. It would also help your enjoyment of the film if you have not seen the many, many examples where each scene had been conducted much better. My final rating for this film is 2.5 stars."

Harry Hart, code name Galahad, nominates Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin; the son of an agent who died saving Galahad. It soon becomes apparent that most of the other candidates see him as a council estate oik but as the training progresses and others drop out it becomes clear that he might just have what it takes to become a Kingsman. While this is happening the Kingsmen work to uncover what Lancelot was doing when he was killed; signs point to American billionaire Richmond Valentine¬Ö who it turns out has a rather drastic plan to solve the problem of over population.This is clearly trying to be like James Bond turned up to eleven; in some ways it works; in others it doesn't. Colin Firth does a fine job as the suave Galahad; a character that felt like a cross between James Bond and John Steed¬Ö but more violent. Taron Egerton does a solid job as Eggsy, Sophie Cookson was good as his friend Roxy and Mark Strong is good as tech-specialist 'Merlin'. As the villain Samuel L. Jackson was rather fun although he was overshadowed by Sofia Boutella who made a great henchwoman; the way she used the swords built into her characters prosthetic legs was certainly memorable. The action was fairly over-the-top in a rather fun way; it is violent though¬Ö in an early scene a man is sliced in half vertically; if that doesn't bother you the rest should be okay. Strangely the ending which features many exploding heads eschews gore in favour of a firework like effect that felt a bit too cartoony for my taste. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre; it skilfully manages to walk the fine line between a 'proper' spy movie and a parody¬Ö it isn't for the too easily offended though."

The keyword being ""franchise"" - the crown jewel of contemporary movie-making.Given the premises and the endless thirst of the audience for more gore, more ""comic"" violence (Tarantino style) and more stupidity, Kingsman does not fail to deliver.Colin Firth plays the coolest spy ever, in a service so secret that nobody knows about it. Modelled on King Arthur's mythology, members of the service have knights nicknames, such as Lancelot and Galahad and are supposed to be ""real gentlemen"". Any attempt to provide the movie with style ends with the display of the expensive clothes and accessories the ""knights"" wear (AKA product placement)Samuel L. Jackson plays a parody of all the villains he played in countless movies. However, most of the weight of the movie is carried by a couple of unremarkable newcomers: one male, one female, to guarantee gender balance.Further political correctness is provided by a large number of additional villains being white males and by aristocrats demeaning themselves, commoners-style.The plot is classic James Bond: eccentric, powerful guy wants to take control of the planet via demented plan. Follows a series of fights and last second interventions and without any suspense the end is known. Silly, vulgar, bombastic, violent, vile, crude ""entertainment"" that will definitely produce many more sequels."

The film has an excellent supporting cast, with Michael Caine as Arthur, head of the Kingsman service, Mark Strong as Merlin the gadget guy and a deliciously fun performance from Samuel L Jackson as Valentine the films main antagonist hell bent on world domination. The plot of the film does not so much matter as just sitting back and enjoying the madness that unfolds. Stand out scenes include a warm up fight sequence in a pub that first introduces us to Harry Hart and an all out gore fest in a Church that makes the infamous fight scene in ""Old Boy"" look like a high school brawl. There is plenty of tongue in cheek humor to balance all of the violence. Highly recommended!"

Colin Firth is simply Colin Firth but god damn does it work... I never had him pictured as an action hero but he pulls it off brilliantly!The film is just plain enjoyable... It takes all the greatest Bond Movie Tropes and turns them into a thoroughly entertaining movie... While at the same time throwing a lot of real life questions into the mix... Not going to go too much into that as it would spoil the movie.So for an Excellent Movie - Why only a 7?Well, yeah there are bad points and here its the old classic of Shaky Cam... I can forgive it as this was 2014 and this was pretty much a staple of most movies back then, but it makes fight scenes very hard to follow. The action IS enjoyable, but also somewhat too chaotic at times...And some of the editing is DEPLORABLE!!! Why have 3 cuts when you can have 15?No Seriously!!! Some of the action scenes cut between two different scenes up to 15 TIMES!!! The Church scene cuts between Samuel L. Jackson and the main fight over and over and over...
