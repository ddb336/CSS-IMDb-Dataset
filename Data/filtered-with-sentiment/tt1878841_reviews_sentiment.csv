" A horror film you shouldn't watched.
",-0.5719,0.6973,2020-12-17 00:00:00,1,"Ever get the feeling your watching a boo scare? This is the type of film that really gets you into the mood too not really like it at all. everytime i try to get into this, it tends to run itself out of energy by doing the 3 second rule of jump scares. it fully takes you out of the movie without really knowing why. This is the movie that tries too hard to be scary, but it just ends up being very loud, and full of itself. you know the movie you find in a dumpster near that garage sale you frequently visit and you wonder why they threw it out to begin with, so you go alright this could be fun, yet there is nothing about the darkness that breaths scare me, more then being a boo scare extravanganza.One scene is an example, is when someone is in the bathroom doing the usual business, and out of nowhere comes a boo scares, then right as your about to relax and breath they turn theire head and all of a sudden it's another hell i'm going to shriek at you again kind of scare. not really having any build up to why they're scaring you too begin with. No setup not fun just a repeated cliche that doesn't know what it wants anymore. I'm deeply into kevin bacon as he's a great actor sometimes, and does a great time of macon bacon.This just has issues finding its identity, and even if it does have the supernatural elements of native pride folklore, it really doesn't know how to keep itself alive without screaming at you. I'm an avid lover of horror, and this made me want to take it back to the dumper i found it from. This doesn't even belong in then 7-eleven bin down a highway somewhere that oddly sells movies for 50 cents for a 5 stack of movies in the used section. Even blockbuster would cry if this was in any section of the video store. Sorry."
" Not bad
",0.431,-0.9507,2020-10-18 00:00:00,7,"I looked at the reviews before watching this and thought it was going to be really bad, but the wife and I watched it anyways. I found it to be a decent movie. I liked that something happened in almost every scene and although the ending wasn't great, it wasn't bad either.If you have an hour and a half to kill check this movie out."
" Long and boring
",-0.3182,0.2182,2020-10-18 00:00:00,1,"A waste of time. Literally NOTHING is happening. Boring Horror Classics like random sounds in the house (people walking on the attic), doors closing and tv's turning on by themselves - nothing new! You don't get to see any ghosts, monsters or whatever until the last 30-20 minutes, and when you finally get to see something it's not special or scary at all. Even Kevin Bacon wasn't at his best at all in this movie. Also, the kid who plays his little son in this movie, is supposed to act like a kid with Autism, yet there's barely any visible acting which makes you think there's anything going on with him.Again: A waste of time! You keep hoping something is going to happen but nothing is going to. Keep looking for a better Horror movie and thank me later."

I'd went to get a little chocolate, and a bottled water from the dorm fridge upstairs in the dark and turned around, and Maddie was (black dog) staring right between my legs when I'd bent over! Wow! I screamed like a little girl and practically had a heart attack on the spot. Oh my. You've really got to see this movie in the dark and bend your science outlook a bit about the Hopi Indians in the Grand Canyon. I won't reveal anything other than the autistic boy gets some very very strange stones.......(on Netflix). Murf"

" Agree with the audience - (4.3)
",0.3612,0.7866,2020-08-19 00:00:00,4,"Watched this movie in Netflix.At the time I am reviewing the overall IMDB rating is 4.4. My rating is also similar to the audience 4.3.The film started good, but the plot didn't go well and was disappointed.Acting was good, but story wasn't the great.The horror scenes would not fright you much.Verdict: - Even though this cannot be termed as a bad movie, there are many other horror movies and I wouldn't recommend viewing this."
" Was good until the ending.
",0.4404,-0.5927,2020-08-01 00:00:00,3,Kevin Bacon deserves way better than this. Only gave it a 3 because of his acting. The ending was awful. Why is it in every horror film with spirits they have to add an ethnic person that believes in ghosts to get rid of them since apparently Hollywood doesn't believe there are people in American culture that do exorcisms too? Great idea but awful ending.
" Lame. Fell asleep during it
",-0.4215,-0.12,2020-07-20 00:00:00,2,"Watched the movie because of Kevin Bacon. It was lame, full of cliches and put me to sleep. Don't waste your time watching this movie"
" An amazing actor in a terrible film
",0.1779,-0.6908,2020-07-02 00:00:00,4,"When you get involved in a non-original story with no direction and don´t have the space to express yourself as an artist, bad things happen."
" Was desperately waiting for a real full-sized buffalo to attack in the house!
",-0.7177,0.6661,2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"But no, we didn't get a buffalo attacks scene. Basically, if you want a story by uneducated Hollywood writers not understanding Native American culture, this movie is for you. Another poster already noted that Native Americans don't normally speak Spanish, especially shaman. Bacon and mom were good. Though better if attacked by a bison."
" It was okay
",0.2263,0.8777,2020-06-28 00:00:00,6,Definitely was a Poltergeist ripoff. But it does have entertainment value. And it was creepy at times. But the Poltergeist themes can't be ignored while watching it.
" Atrocious movie!

" No answers
",-0.296,-0.9829,2020-06-24 00:00:00,5,The movie would have been great but they never shared what happened to the friends they first camped with in the opening of the movie. The other thing that really made us mad was the neighbor's German Shepard was taken to be killed by animal control when he was only controlled by the evil ghosts and the dog was only a victim to suffer death.
" TERRIBLE
",-0.4767,-0.7522,2020-06-23 00:00:00,1,"Seriously, just don't watch it. The plot is weak. The graphics are awful. The acting is awful. It's all around a comedy more then thriller."
" So bad
",-0.5849,-0.8904,2020-06-22 00:00:00,2,With all the familiar faces I expected a somewhat decent movie but I was very disappointed. Extremely boring and the characters are poorly developed. Lots of random story lines and weird dialog. Definitely a waste of time.
" Painful to watch
",-0.4404,-0.9088,2020-06-21 00:00:00,1,"How desperate was Kevin Bacon to be in this movie? It's incredibly slow and boring. The characters have no personalities. The acting is pretty bad, even Kevin Bacon's wasn't good, so I think it's from the lack of character development. They seemed to focus more on the family's psychological issues than they did on anything paranormal. And the ghostly things that happened were lame. Dirty handprints everywhere, the kitchen faucet kept turning on, and for some reason the neighbors dog attacks them in the middle of the night, apparently having unlocked and opened their front door with his doggie paws. I like paranormal movies but this one was just painful."

" Nothing New Here

",0.0,0.0387,2020-06-19 00:00:00,4,"It's like Possession but instead of a dybbuk box, it's magic Native American stones and instead of a demon from Jewish demonology, it's a series of animal and elemental spirits connected to an ancient Pueblo tribe.It's a bit patronizing, like all horror movies that take aspects from a ""foreign"" source to be spooky and alien. But also, Kevin Bacon plays a super patronizing guy in self denial, so it could be from that.It's shot well, but the score is super ""oooooohhhhh scary and ominous"" and that's annoying throughout. There's some genuinely scary moments, moments where the director proves he understands suspense but then other times, it's just blah.It's truly a hit or miss movie. If it was your first horror movie, it'd be nice."
" All wrong with Navajo ways
",-0.4767,0.9568,2020-06-19 00:00:00,1,"I am Diné (Navajo) and I am giving this movie one star because the acting was good. But the story line is way off. First of all Anasazi to Navajo is ""ancient enemy"", Second we don't speak Spanish nor use Christian symbols for ceremonial purposes and third at least use a real Navajo and the one that is fluent in Diné Bizaad (Navajo language). I am sure they can find one person on the rez. We all still practice our culture and ceremonies (medicine men) to this day. Its funny they use Hopi Kachinas as Anasazi people. (Different) Haha, way way way off! Please better educate yourself Hollywood. And no Navajos don't have teepees, we have Hogans."
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,-0.661,2020-06-19 00:00:00,4,"I'm not one to turn off movies... I'm content to suffer through till the end regardless of how bad it is. In my time I've turned off a few and honestly I'm surprised this wasn't one. No spoilers here. Shot like my 12 year old on an iPad, and as a mother of a 10 year old on the spectrum I found the character to be incorrect and unnecessary. Dried up story line. C- acting and poor directing choices. Next time spend a little less money on the set and cast, and put a bit more into the ""bad guys"". Worth the watch? Maybe. One and done."
" Not horrible
",0.431,0.431,2020-06-19 00:00:00,6,Aside from being a poltergeist ripoff its not a horrible movie
" Disappointing
",-0.4939,0.8225,2020-06-19 00:00:00,4,"Started out well, and the acting was pretty good, but about half way through it, I could feel my interest waning. Had potential, but never really developed any momentum."
" Problematic script haunts movie
",-0.5994,-0.8534,2020-06-18 00:00:00,2,"Snakes, crows, wolves, coyote and buffalo are sacred animals to multiple native tribes. They act as figures of power, healing or messengers between people and the spirit world. They are revered and respected.Yet this movie portrays them as demons, figures of harm and evil. It's akin to giving Jesus vampire fangs and making him posses a house and terrorize a family. If McLean had done any kind of research or had any kind of tribal expert act as a consultant, he would know that.Equally as stupid/offensive is the fact that the script says the animal demons bring out the darkness in people, exacerbating the family members' autism, bulimia, alcoholism and infidelity.The movie doesn't adequately build the family's characters, but instead gives them these conditions as a substitute for personality, exploiting the conditions for sensationalism hoping it will cause the audience to care about/identify with them. It lumps these conditions into the same basket as if they're equivalent and uses them to try to ""say something"", but it's just a problematic jumbled mess.The ""Hopi"" healers they bring in are hispanic and speak Spanish. If you can get Kevin Bacon but can't get one native actor to star in your movie that has a major native plot, you either didn't try to cast one or no native actors wanted to be in it and that says something.Just poorly conceived, poorly executed ideas. What's most frustrating is that the central cast was solid and the technical execution of the haunting effects was pretty good. If the script hadn't had so many issues, the movie had the potential to be good.There's a lot of potential for Native American horror and the things it could say, if people could get beyond the Indian Burial Grounds, cursed objects and skin-walkers."

" Poltergeist derivative film but has its merits.
",0.5499,-0.0258,2020-06-17 00:00:00,6,"Basic formula of Poltergeist (minus the missing child) is depicted with a family whose son is on the Autism spectrum and thus a natural magic to the supernatural. This film has a heavier emphasis on domestic issues (i.e. troubled marriage from husband's infidelity, in recovery alcoholic mother, living with a behaviorally disordered child, adolescent mental illness). What it is missing is a deeper connection with the material as both storylines feel parallel without really intersecting. Still, decent premise that somehow was critiqued negatively for the tropes upon which it trod, but it does it adequately. (One thing though, whoever's decided that Kevin Bacon's hair color was okay needs to be checked.)"
" Is it wrong?
",-0.4767,-0.504,2020-06-17 00:00:00,6,Is it wrong of me to be upset the neighbor never got his dog back?? Lol
" Overdone
",0.0,-0.9847,2020-04-30 00:00:00,2,"It's overdone. Not in topic, it's actually quite an interesting twist on a haunting that I rather liked.It just feels stale though. Perhaps it didn't age well.The tropes on ""autism"" are horrendous, they have to remind you at every turn that they child is autistic, possibly because the kid is no Leo DiCap when it comes to acting it. Childish does not mean autistic....The jump scares are terrible. There's just the ever present hint of racism when dealing with the Native lore. The daughter having an eating disorder felt dull and added to give a dull character an ounce of depth. She herself is a caricature of an angsty teen girl who just HATES her parents and THEY NEED TO LEAVE HER ALONE AND STAY OUT OF HER ROOM! My eyes could not have ROLLED HARDER.Why does every movie have to have a young female assistant sleep with her boss? It's overplayed. Unfortunately, while movie makers may not believe it, young woman CAN have a job and not want to sleep with their boss! They CAN just be there, to do their JOB, after having gone to school for SEVERAL years and spending THOUSANDS of dollars to earn a degree in that field. They definitely don't just do all that to educate themselves in a field they are passionate about. They DEFINITELY JUST DO IT TO FIND A MAN TO SLEEP WITH.Also, I don't like Kevin Bacon's face.Terrible movie. If you're a real horror fan, it's boring. Will not surprise you, will do much more for you than take an hour and a half away from you.Great movie to watch if you wanna be on your phone the whole time though!"
" boring
",-0.3182,-0.8658,2020-04-25 00:00:00,5,"The plot is kinda ordinary, not really something new, it's the cliche 'boy get possessed and terrorises its family and whaaa this Spanish woman comes to cleanse the house happy ending' type beat. The actors were pretty bad and no one died throughout the entire movie. Like men.... it's a 16+ horror movie, the dynamics were bad. The little boy that was 'possessed' pissed me off way to many times. And the teenager daughter was way too much of a stereotype. The movie was 1,5 hours and everything happened in the last 10 minutes, the first three quarters of the movie was just the demons playing. Like wow give me some variation instead of the (door creaking) or (loud noises) subtitles."
" Worst horror movie ever
",-0.8316,-0.9623,2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,"So, the thing about this movie is that it's just bad. It's not scary at all and there is no story. Most bad horror movies are kind of funny but this is just bad. The scariest thing that happens in this movie( besides Kevin Bacon being in it😭 )was a dog walking down the hall and that doors open by them selves. Some weird stuff happens to like that the girl has a eating disorder and pukes in a basket and hides it under her bed. When her mom finds out, the girl does what any sane person does. Strangle her. And the mom has a drinking problem and just buys two HUGE bottles of vodka and doesn't think ""Man, I told my husband I wouldn't drink anymore. Well, he won't find these bottles of vodka because I'm just going to leave them out on a table."". This is the king of terrible scary movies."
" A candidate for bad movie night.
",-0.5423,0.8743,2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,"""The Darkness"" is one of those amazing bad movies where so much is wrong, poorly conceived or both that it's a miracle it saw release. Here we have an ""Indian Burial Ground"" movie that takes place in a modern suburban setting. How might you ask? A little boy stumbles into a cavern containing magic stones that keep the vengeful spirits away. He takes them home and the spirits follow to plot revenge? I don't know. They mostly leave doors open and turn sinks on randomly. I suppose just having a toddler at home would be as frightening.The little boy is autistic and his parents played by Kevin Bacon and Radha Mitchell never seem to have learned how to interact with him. He has little to no boundaries and gets all the action figures he wants. The lazy excuse of ""autism"" as a plot device is offensive when we get no in-story explanation for why the character has to be afflicted with this condition. The film somewhat makes up for this occurrence in its conclusion yet many better films portray children as unafraid of things that scare adults.Parental overindulgence of the boy has affected the older daughter who resents her parents and inexplicably has an eating disorder. The movie never justifies why she has to have an eating disorder or why she stores vomit in tupperware under her bed. This behavior is so weird that I'd love to see it developed into the story.Bacon and Mitchell are competent actors, and I was more interested in the family drama than any of the horror stuff. They play the married couple well. The backstory of his affair and why the daughter is bulimic would make for a better movie. The script even introduces a co-worker who clearly wants to get close to Kevin for no reason (again). A lifetime movie exists here.Perhaps the little boy could just be envisioning ghosts rather than the ghosts actually being there. The film somewhat explores this idea by introducing an imaginary friend character for the boy to never mention her again. The friend eventually places dirty handprints everywhere which I think is supposed to be scary.The final act has one of the funniest scenes that elevates the films to legendary status among bad movie fans. The family hires a pagan exorcist to remove the ghosts from the home. She holds two prongs in her hand and chants at the wall in Spanish! You cannot see it without smiling.What a decline for Greg McLean. He made a memorable film called ""Wolf Creek"" in his native Australia a decade ago and has never come close to replicating that film's quality. He made a humorous sequel to it a few years ago with intentional visual humor. Now he is peddling garbage for Blumhouse to release in bargain bins. I hope he returns to Australia where he seems to make better films."
" Well written character reactions
",0.2732,0.6177,2020-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Nice story, engaging movie! The thing I appreciated most is the realistic portrayal of the characters, in regard to believing when proof is shown, reacting properly when being caught cheating, etc. No character acted in a stereotypical horror movie cliche. Instead, they absorbed new info and acted accordingly. Even the arrogant boss came through after realizing he was a d*$k to the women. I could go on....Not groundbreaking, but well made entertainment."
" A family friendly version of The Conjuring, and worth a look
",0.6249,0.9903,2020-03-08 00:00:00,7,"There is nothing wrong in a horror movie being family friendly. It doesn't need to be a comedy either. I would have scored this movie higher, as it is beautifully put together, and on the production side everything is golden. Some great special effects too. I have a slight problem with the adults. After they know their son is susceptible to dark influences they still carry on life without keeping an eye on him. From a certain point almost all the drama is on how close this boy gets to danger, and yet when his elder sister is asked to babysit she immerses herself in music and her computer, with headphones on, and even the mother will immerse herself in computer and headphones, thus neither hearing the commotion. Maybe it's only me that noticed this quirk in the story. I'm still docking a point for it. For me, this being a 'family friendly' horror movie, well, such an oversight was hard to watch, particularly with such a vulnerable boy. Aside from that pickle this is still a very good watch, with a clever and original idea delivered with great production values, heart-pounding tension and some great effects."
" A nice supernatural thriller, not a horror movie!!
",0.7771,0.9455,2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"I never wrote any reviews, but it's a shame this movie gets all of these bad comments and gets a bad score. Good actors, nice setting, nothing too stupid. It's just not a horror movie. It's not that scary. But if you just want to watch a nice supernatural thriller then you will like this one for sure!"
" Reasonably entertaining, nothing more.
",0.4404,-0.8657,2020-03-02 00:00:00,6,"I was not impressed. It's reasonably entertaining but no more than that. No surprises, just a patchwork of well-known horror-clichés. Especially ""Poltergeist"" came to my mind, due to the Indian origins of the ghosts, the manifestations in the house and the old lady excorsist. The story is a bit simple to begin with, and they wriggled in all kinds of weird side-lines that weren't relevant to the main story whatsoever, like the eating-disorder of the daughter and the marital problems between mom and dad. Even the autism of son Mikey wasn't really necessary for the story, the ghosts were evoked by his stealing of the stones, not by his autism. The special effects were okay, as was the acting (I was impressed by Lucy Fry as the daughter, especially in the scene where her eating disorder is found out), but I kept wondering why Kevin Bacon agreed to participate, since it can hardly be called a challenging role, and also why throughout the whole movie he looked so worn-out, with hollow cheeks and red eyes. Was he unwell during filming or is this the summum of professional method acting?"

They are flat with no depth which is surprising considering the acting power present. With all the great actors, none of it sticks. The flat dialogue does not help. The final confrontation is part cheese, part CGI non-sense, and part every Poltergeist concept. There is a suggestion of a fascinating belief or disbelief due to Mikey's autism.

It is not the scariest horror movie - and, if you watch a lot of horror movies, you might even say it is not scary at all. 
You will have the usual scares: noices, shadows, objects moving by themselves, etc. 
BUT: The story behind these is different than usually! And it has a lot of great and well-known actors. 
If you are into TV shows, be sure not to miss the little scenes with Jennifer Morrison (""Once Upon a Time"") and Ming-Na Wen (""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.""). 
There's also Paul Reiser very convincingly playing a very annoying character. 
Kevin Bacon is a great lead and David Mazouz as Michael Taylor might be the creepiest part of the whole movie. Watch it! -- But don't necessarily compare it to movies like ""The Conjuring"" and its franchise or ""Insidious"". It's not a James Wan movie."

The acting was crisp enough, and I like the idea that instead of the wholesome family under siege, this one was dysfunctional, with each one fighting their own demons (rather than the supernatural ones). This movie brimmed with ideas.The problem, I thought, with this movie is its pacing. I thought that the first half of the movie was unnecessarily long and tended to drag out the suspense until there really wasn't any suspense left. This meant that their was little time to get into the heart of the characters and their individual flaws, let alone the medium who appears too much near the end of the film.I felt that whilst this movie borrowed a lot from Poltergeist, it went to too many lengths trying not to be Poltergeist, and as a result the project suffered.A pity really because this movie had all the elements of being a great movie, but squandered it on timing.

A kid brings some rocks back home, but it turns out they're cursed by a demon which proceeds to follow them and make their family life a misery. Despite the presence of some useful players here this is very much an ordinary production which I found very mundane. There are bits and pieces of THE EXORCIST, POLTERGEIST, INSIDIOUS and plenty of other films visible throughout and yet the film has no distinct voice like any of those other movies. Kevin Bacon and Radha Mitchell are good value as the parents but they have little to work with here and Bacon's STIR OF ECHOES was much more entertaining. Director Greg McLean previosly made mini-masterworks like ROGUE and WOLF CREEK so it's a shame to see him wasting his time on this; try THE BELKO EXPERIMENT for a much more enjoyable time."

",-0.7025,0.9593,2018-05-01 00:00:00,5,"There are both good and bad reviews of this film. I like my dose of supernatural horror so I went into it open minded. Pretty big names as actors and the director of Wolf Creek, so why not.A family goes camping in grand canyon, autist boy picks up some indian rocks from a cave, an imaginary friend appears at home, weird things start to happen, family seems to break up.In short, it's somewhat well made, but script lacks. It's never that engaging and the characters aren't THAT likable. Kevin Bacon is pretty good in the lead, but in all honesty I was thinking whether he's a bit old for such role already at almost 60 (feels weird Kevin Bacon is that old!). A minor detail, but he seems to play a role better suited for a 40 something.The script is the worst here tho, not a lot feels relevant. In the beginning they are camping with friends, but we never hear from the friends again. There's plenty of family drama (eating disorder, alcohol, extramarital affair), none of which really work in the whole. On the other hand their sons autism would've deserved a lot more script time. The story is not very interesting really.And who was that imaginary Jenny in the end? Maybe I just missed it.It feels really strange that they got known actors, not only Kevin Bacon, but Radha Mitchell and Paul Reiser in this, while it's clearly a passable b-movie. Watch it if there isn't anything better available, but don't expect a masterpiece."

I really hate how most horror movies have a ""surprise"" ending where the ghost (or whatever creature) comes back and wins in the end. It's so tired and cliched. If you think of some o the best horror movies ever made - The Exorcist, Poltergeist - they had good endings. No weird surprises where the demon came back and killed them all just for shock value. This movie is good if for nothing else than it didn't play into that stupid cliche.Also, I've seen very few movies that delved into Anasazi mythos. It was trendy for a while back in the 90s, which the petroglyphs and Chaco Canyon. So I'm glad brought that in as the main ghosty antagonist.It was nice to see Kevin Bacon back in a horror movie, it's been a while since Stir of Echoes. There were other solid actors as well, such s Paul Reiser. So not a lot of cheesy acting here.It was about a nice family trying to hold it together, and in the end they succeeded. Good for them.

Also appreciate the horror genre and have liked films in similar vein, so watched 'The Darkness' oddly enough with the genuine want and intent to like it. It does pain me to say it, and it is going to sound repetitive being a common thing found in recent viewings and mentioned, but 'The Darkness' managed to be a big disappointment for me and from the sounds of it many others. Big potential, executed in a way that while not terrible rarely rose above mediocrity overall. There are moments and good things, but they were too far and between and not enough for a film that did little with such a good idea. It may annoy people with me saying this a lot recently, but it is hard to not say anything when wastes of good ideas and talent is a bugbear of mine and something that has featured rather too heavily in my recent film viewings.Kevin Bacon and Radha Mitchell are reasonable leads and David Mazouz is more than up to their level. So the acting is better than average on the whole and somehow manages to rise above the material that was not worthy of them.'The Darkness' does have an atmospherically spooky look, an eerie music score and a few unsettling moments. Unfortunately, the creepiness and suspense not just doesn't come consistently, there is nowhere near enough of either. There is an over-reliance on scares, mainly of the jumpy kind, but few come off effectively. Again a few unsettling moments, but too much of them are easily foreseeable and derivative.Furthermore, too much is over-explained, there is far too much exposition (much of it clumsy and rambling) and too much is given away too soon. The characters aren't very interesting, not to mention very clichéd that it makes the distinct lack of originality even more obvious, making everything really predictable. The script is lazy and underwritten, with too much reliance on the scares, which are not strong enough to come over successfully, the ending is a very ""that's it?"" one and the intrusive and obvious sound effects telegraph the outcome of the scares early on in the build-ups. In summary, not terrible but mediocre and a waste of potential. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

The boy picks up the stones, puts them in his backpack, and joins the family and everybody goes home and weird things start to happen.Strange noises, putrid smells, wild animals appearing suddenly, handprintsthings escalate rapidly and the boy is blamed; but the parents wonder maybe there are ghosts, but maybe it's just the boy and he is becoming dangerous, then again maybe there are spirits, but the boy is acting funny and started a fire and almost burned down the housethe family can't seem to make up its mind on what to do with the autistic son. So he stays in the house and more weird but violent things happen. The daughter knows there is something supernatural going on; the mom (played by Radha Mitchell) finally catches on and does research on the internet about paranormal stuff; and the dad (played by Kevin Bacon)ha ha, good luck trying to convince him there are evil spooks in his house.Oh, somewhere in the 2nd act, the daughter is revealed to be bulimic; Mitchell falls off the wagon and resumes her drinking problem; and Bacon is revealed to have cheated on his wife in the past and he has to deal with a hot assistant who is tempting him — all subplots that are completely unnecessary and makes the movie wander around and lose focus. I believe the writer and director were trying to convey how the family was falling apart because of the influence of the evil spirits; but these things could have easily been cut out and made the story leaner and tighter with a better pace.Back to the focus of ""The Darkness"": the five demons are slowly using the boy to create a pathway for them to enter our world and destroy it. Why? Um, it's not mentioned, so I have to assume that they are just being demons. Bacon and Mitchell must find a way to figure out what is going on and how to stop the evil from getting through, or else the world is doomed.My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Darkness"" is the scene when the portal opens up fully and instead of the spirits coming out, the autistic son goes in and the spirits are taking him deeper into the cave where the stones were originally hidden. Huh? What? Aren't the spirits supposed to enter our world and destroy it? So why are they retreating further into the cave where they have been trapped for hundreds of years? Maybe I missed something but I don't think so. It just doesn't add up.""The Darkness"" is well acted, well directed, has a decent plot, and provides a few scares that are mostly cheap.

" Kevin can't wait to forget this 'Darkness'
",0.1695,-0.9704,2017-10-22 00:00:00,4,"In recent years, supernatural thrillers have tried to look for new source material beyond the tired old ""haunted house inhabited by ghosts"" storyline that we're used to. From voodoo spirits in the Louisiana bayous in 'The Skeleton Key' to a haunted doll in the 'Annabelle' series. In Blumhouse Productions' 2016 film 'The Darkness,' we see what happens when ancient spirits worshiped by the Anasazi Native Americans are awakened and terrorize a run-of-the-mill family from LA.Basically, what happens is the Taylor family is vacationing in the Grand Canyon when young son Michael (David Mazouz), who is Autistic, stumbles upon ancient stones that were used by the natives who inhabited the land to trap evil spirits who terrorized them. Of course, Michael takes these stones back home with him, unbeknownst to the rest of his family, and weird things begin to happen. While the premise of film is more creative than many, as is the case with a number of films in this genre, 'Darkness' falters when it comes to execution.On the acting front, this really is ""The Kevin Bacon Show,"" as he is the lead name attached to this project. While he does a respectable job playing Taylor patriarch Peter, who is a conflicted character with a heavy past, it is not enough to bring things to life. Radha Mitchell does a solid job in the supporting role of Bronny Taylor, a recovering alcoholic who does her best to keep her family from falling apart once things begin to unravel. But this film isn't about the performances, it's about whether the entire package can make the audience feel unsettled and scared without leaving a feeling of boredom or like it was time wasted. In this sense, 'Darkness' falls short.One of the most annoying things about 'Darkness' is how uneven it is. There really is no traditional story arc or build to a climax that is resolved - the entire time, it feels like you're driving and hitting all the red lights - we see developments in the plot, but then we change directions and it's like what we saw was just a distraction. Of course, the developments are supposed to be pieces of the puzzle that should in theory be solved by the end of the film, but nothing feels this all that deliberate. It instead comes across as a a messy compilation of creepy happenings and a lot of family drama.'The Darkness' showed signs of being a promising low-budget supernatural thriller but unfortunately never gets off the ground, which explains why it was shelved and ultimately dumped into theaters when it was."

This is not a horror movie, unless you are younger than 10 years, maybe. It's an awful mess of lame ideas copied shamelessly from genre classics and mixed together into a superficial esoteric story convoluted by unbelievable family drama.Why did actors like Bacon and Mitchell do this job? Bored to death? Out of money? The acting is the only thing in this movie that made me give it more than 1 star. The director botched it big time on all levels of movie making. The pacing was awful, actually nothing happened until the very last 15 minutes, and even that went down the drain. The whole family drama stuff felt artificial and out of place, this family faced so many problems and in the end a supernatural experience brings them back together...well, just BS.There was no tension in the movie, ever. Besides people ""acting like you and me"" by sitting in dark rooms intentionally while weird sounds come from the attic, the movie constantly rubbed everything in the face of the audience. I always knew what was going on or to come next, as the movie had just told me before it happened. There was no mystery in it at all. The parts where they looked up everything on the internet in seconds - finding fully fledged websites about their specific (oh sure) problems that looked like an advertising agency had designed them... The whole Anasazi demons mumbojumbo being stretched out until you just didn't want to wait until they finally appear. When the old healer lady entered the house I had a last spark of hope that finally now hell would break loose...well, not really. Not at all. The whole thing was a letdown and felt like it was made for a very young audience. Nothing happens, people do scream a few times, one get's bitten by the neighbours dog, two others get a few minor cuts from flying glass shards. That's all! Horror doesn't mean blood, but come on - those demons were as evil and frightening as an old hag on the street.You don't need to be a cineast or a professional film critic to know that this movie was crap. If you find it entertaining, well, blessed is the simple mind. If you say this movie scared you a bit, you should never go outside except in bright sunlight. And even then your own shadow could make your heart stop.Mr. Mclean is a lousy writer (actually more sort of a cribber) and a mediocre director. I didn't see any promising talent here that would make me want to see his next opus. This movie is a total waste of time, unless you need some illustrative material about how not to do it."

That's not to say I will like it though. This has to be one of his worst movies. Let's get going.Synopsis: A family returns from a Grand Canyon vacation, haunted by an ancient supernatural entity they unknowingly awakened and engages them in a fight for their survival. Starring: Kevin Bacon, Radha Mitchell Director: Greg McLeanThe Ugly: We already had one horrible remake of Poltergeist, why did we need another? Answer: we didn't. Now, this necessarily wasn't a direct remake, this movie added in some elements from two Stephen King novels called Desperation and The Regulators. Go look them up and you'll see what I mean. In the long run, this more like Poltergeist than its own movie.The Bad: The side stories in the movie. Did we need them as well? Not so much. Were they required? Yes they were. Here's why. They had a basis for a movie. At some point they realized they didn't have a long enough movie so they added a couple of story lines to add more to the movie. Not as bad as an obvious remake though.The Good: Here, the best part of the movie was the acting. Kevin Bacon always shines no matter what he does. Radha Mitchell is always good in the troubled wife role. Even Paul Reiser fit the role he was picked for. Too bad they didn't have a better script or director.Final Thoughts: Star power couldn't save this movie. It had potential, but fell drastically short.Rating: 4 out of 10"

",-0.855,-0.9766,2017-06-26 00:00:00,1,"The darkness..where do i begin. family,grand canyon,evil spirit comes home,boring..there ya go,quicker way to say plot. This film is awful,i absolutely hated it,the plot was one of the most worst ever. This is like just thinking up the worst plot ever like a haunted shoe or a bottle of perfume from many centuries sent back to kill. The acting is also bad,its like a man just picked a bunch of random people to star in this..awful. The darkness is a terrible,no scary,disastrous horror film. Hate It!"
" Nothing new to see here. [+28%]
",0.0,-0.1161,2017-06-10 00:00:00,3,"Greg McLean's 'The Darkness' is an exercise in clichés. The film tries almost every trick in the book in an attempt to rise above the rest but ends up looking thoroughly lacklustre. McLean is more a master of the torture-porn kind of horror than the supernatural and hence, this effort looks forced and half-baked. Kevin Bacon and Radha Mitchell try to do justice to their poorly written characters. The screenplay itself is devoid of any major scares (jumpscares even!). The climax is again too easily predictable and plays out more like a TV show than a film."
" If you like The Poltergeist....
",0.3612,-0.9432,2017-04-20 00:00:00,2,"Despite the decent cast, this film is a snoozefest. The conflicts between characters outside of the main story line are supposed to add depth and build connections with the audience however in The Darkness those conflicts feel forced and are quite frankly rather unimaginative.Riddled with clichés at every turn, The Darkness offers nothing remotely original or thought provoking and the story line was so unbelievably convenient, I rolled my eyes into the back of my head more often than their cliché teen daughter.Often I'll recommend movies to friends even if I don't really enjoy it by saying something like, ""If you have a an hour or so to kill, it may be worth a watch"", but I cannot say that here, folks.Save your time or just re-watch The Poltergeist, that's what this film was trying to be anyway... only it failed miserably."
" Horror films do not get worse than this. A complete failure.
",-0.6647,-0.9159,2017-04-17 00:00:00,2,"Blumhouse continues to ruin and defile the horror genre by releasing one of worst films I have seen in my life. It's amazing how one production company can have such a negative influence in my favorite genre, and nothing can be done to stop them. It's also baffling to me that a movie with such A+ talent attached to it (Kevin Bacon, Radha Mitchell, Ming-Na Wen) can yield such a sub-par film. It seemed like most of the budget was allocated to paying the actors, with very little left over for adding any real horror to the movie. The special effects were such a joke, that I have seen Found-footage films do a better job at being convincing. It's film-making like this that ruin cinema for me, and one of the reasons why I stopped going to the movies so often. Blumhouse, please do the world a favor and stop making movies. Your contributions are offensive and are almost always reviled by anyone who sees them. Stop ruining horror just to simply turn a profit. You are the absolute worst thing to happen to movies since Uwe Boll decided to start directing them."

Peter (Kevin Bacon) and his wife Bronny (Radha Mitchell) begin sharing their home with daughter Stephanie (Lucy Fry) and autistic son Mikey (David Mazour) with some inexplicable events like water turning on, footstep sounds in the attic and mysterious hand prints about the home. It is believed they brought back a malignant spirit from their trip to the Grand Canyon. Or is it a dark entity from hell causing Mikey's erratic behavior?Greg McLean co-writes and directs this tense supernatural horror piece. Some eerie special effects fueled by fear. Bacon's talent seems a bit wasted. Also in the cast: Paul Reiser, Trian Long Smith, Ilza Rosario and Alma Martinez."
" OK but not up to the hype
",0.2421,0.7895,2017-03-24 00:00:00,5,The Darkness was an OK movie kept me entertained but that is about it. They could have done so much more with the script but went back to tried and tested formula. I am glad I never went to the theater and saw it as that would have been not worth it but as a DVD rental cant complain too much.
" Slightly problematic but still rather enjoyable
",0.4672,0.8593,2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Following a family trip to the Grand Canyon, they realize that the mysterious incidents and behavior they've been experiencing since returning are the cause of a dangerous malevolent spirit that's returned with them and must cleanse the house to be safe.Overall, this one wasn't all that bad of a supernatural effort. What really works well here is the fact that there's quite a decent amount of supernatural antics throughout here that make for quite a decent showing. The main mystery here, involving the mystery of the rocks and how the trip there brings them into contact with them makes, for a solid base here which gives this a rather intriguing start to it all that lets this one get rather chilling as it goes along. The slowly emerging sense of supernatural phenomenon, from the strange appearance of the smells to the strange jumps in behavior and then on to even more pronounced problems including the attack on the animals and going off into the rather odd changes that affects them. The biggest influence, the glowing orb of supernatural goo on the walls of his room which continually grows and reaches out to him with their voices and beckoning which goes quite nicely with the development given about his medical condition that exacerbates their powers. While the vast majority of this causes some light-hearted action, it does get into some really strong supernatural action at times with the dog's attack on the daughter in their bedroom while she's sleeping, the numerous communication sequences which shows them bringing their tricks out in fine order as well as the rather intriguing and enjoyable attack with the ghostly handprints emerging on the walls that are quite fun and leads into the big battle at the finale. The cleansing attempt on the house is highly enjoyable with the exceptionally fun over-the-top battles and rituals that occur throughout the house as they attempt to drive the spirits out which is a great deal more active and action-packed than the other scenes in here which makes for a great finish to this one by ending on a high note. These here are enough to make for an enjoyable time, although it does have a few flaws. The biggest issue is the fact that there's just not a whole lot of interest going on when the supernatural elements aren't in focus, going through numerous bland set-ups and set-pieces which just drag the whole section down as the focus on their extramarital affair and their sons' medical condition causing them plenty of stress doesn't make for a highly enjoyable time. As well, many of the early suspected scenes of their supernatural condition doesn't come off as all that scary, from tap-water turning on by itself or being oddly protective of the most banal objects that are supposed to show that something weird's going on yet that doesn't make for a scary time to get this going. Otherwise, this one was rather enjoyable.Rated PG-13: Language, Violence, suggested violence against animals and children-in-jeopardy."
" Excellent Scary Movie!
",0.2003,0.8535,2017-03-20 00:00:00,9,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Darkness"". I became invested in the characters and enjoyed the unique qualities such as the setting in the beginning, the extra family drama that had nothing to do with the story line, the scary entities that were different and kept me intrigued the whole time. Very very good movie! Highly recommended for those who appreciate the little unique things in scary movies."
" this movie peed me off
",0.0,0.8443,2017-03-16 00:00:00,3,"great movie, i liked it. except the fact the ending was awful!!!! please make second one!!! you can't end a movie that way and no make a second! it was a great story behind it all but you can't make something that juicy and interesting without making a second! it just can't be done. i recommend if you're gonna watch it be used to movies that let you down."
" Pointless or Contenders for Dumbest characters ever?
",-0.5106,-0.9771,2017-02-25 00:00:00,3,"MASSIVE (unavoidable) SPOILER regarding my biggest complaint: After witnessing unexplainable stuff happening early on (like 20 minutes into the movie!!), the husband and wife watch a video which explains EXACTLY what has happened, how it happened, and precisely HOW TO RESOLVE IT... yet no one does anything about it (the rocks) until the final moments of the story. Instead, they go to a hotel (at least they were smart enough to leave the house) but then inexplicably try other methods to end the haunting, that fail miserably... even though they've known why & how all along.... I understand they never bothered to ask the kid (or maybe never expected their kid would even answer) but when crazy stuff is happening in your home, and you've watched a video that mirrors EXACTLY what is happening, maybe you should pay attention to the video when it explains how to end the craziness! Beyond this glaring plot hole/character flaw, the movie has high production values and the actors do a fine job with what they have. But between the plot, and some parenting of the year (sarcasm), for a horror movie, it has MOMENTS that try to scare you, but no real suspense building up. I've seen worse, but there are other activities I wish I would've done instead of wasting my time watching this flick."
" The Darkness
",-0.25,0.9265,2017-02-21 00:00:00,7,"A supernatural force terrorizes a couple and their two children after the young son brings home some mysterious rocks from the Grand Canyon.Reading that description, it had my attention but I wondered how good can a horror movie be that's about a kid bringing home some rocks that are haunted? After watching it.....Wow, what a GREAT movie.If you like Horror movies that aren't all guts & gore & full of special effects then you might like The Darkness.I had my doubts at the start but after it was over, I was surprised I even liked it in the 1st place especially how much I liked it.I hope there's going to be a sequel with the same cast coming back like the Poltergeist movies.This movie was similar to Poltergeist so why not? Maybe the same cast, different story like they do American Horror Story? I watched it during the day while it was cloudy & drizzling outside but if I really wanted to scare the crap out of myself, I should've watched it at night.If you ever have a chance to watch The Darkness, I would most definitely say, Go For It"
" The Cliché (2016)
",0.0,-0.0749,2017-02-10 00:00:00,1,"Middle class white American family, check. ""Creepy"" kid doing unusual stuff, check. Generic signs of a demonic presence such as hand prints/faucets turning on by themselves/doors opening by themselves, check. Family searches on the internet on what they're up against, check.Oh, you want me to stop and write about the actual movie? Alright then. Well, Other than the background story of the demons and the five stones, this is all the same garbage you've seen in just about every other horror movie to come out in the past 20 years. Some kid or character does something stupid, day by day things get worse, family calls supernatural investigators, they can't do much s***, family deals with it themselves somehow.Unless you're 5 years old or you've been living under a rock and have never seen another horror movie in your life, the only thing about this movie that will scare you is what could have possibly been on Kevin Bacon's mind when he signed up to be in this train-wreck. The movie could have had one saving grace, but it was a missed opportunity. Because near the end, the ancient animal demonic avatars could have been horrifying if they actually tried, but when you finally see these 5 figures, you're not scared because you KNOW 100% that these are people with goofy looking masks, headdresses and costumes.The only good thing I can say about this movie is Ilza Rosario's pretty face. But keep in mind, you have to go through over 70 minutes of boring garbage to see her for less than 10 minutes. Oh, the struggles..........."
" Had potential and went down the drain
",0.0,0.9743,2017-01-12 00:00:00,4,"This movie is all over the place. The idea is really good and as I said to a friend I would love to get a chance to rewrite this. The original idea and the story line in itself is a new take on a classic idea, which is one of the things I like. Unfortunately it felt like they wanted to put so much in the movie in such little time it just became fractions of a great idea. In a way it almost felt like pieces of several different movies put into one. A drama, a family trip, a horror and a psychological film all in one.I wish they had spent more time on the story than trying to be scary. If this had been half an hour longer, making it a two hour movie and went down the trail of psychological thriller/horror it could have been a really good movie. Instead it seemed like they were shooting for a one and a half scare fest which ended up falling flat.The acting is decent as well, David Mazouz has a real chance at becoming one of the greats in Hollywood. So much talent in such a young boy and I think it's a shame his character was a bit pushed aside to give more screen time to the bigger names. Focusing more on him could have possibly turned this movie around.In conclusion a decent watch if you're okay with plot holes and unfinished story lines."
" Alright but lackluster
",0.128,0.7781,2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Two families visit the desert. The kids go around exploring. One of them falls into some sort of caves and finds some stones.Then we follow one of the families as it returns to normal life in California. The guy is a big shot architect. The son has autism, the daughter has bulimia. As soon as they return, strange things start happening. The water faucets turn themselves on by themselves, the neighbor's dog won't stop barking. The autistic kid has an imaginary friend whom he holds responsible for all this. Everyone of course thinks he is doing all this. Eventually, he starts playing with the stones he brought from the desert. That causes a fire on a wall.Finally the family has had enough. Until then the mother has researched about the Anasazi Indians. And she thinks there might be something to it. The dad sort of agrees. A friend recommends they see a woman for a cleansing. According to the Anasazi story, if you take some of their objects you can invoke some of their bad spirits that terrorized the community. These spirits can end up taking a person with them unless someone with no fear returns the objects to them.So they call the Latin healer who bring a relative to cleanse the house. But obviously the stones will have to be returned during the ceremony.The Darkness is a fairly lackluster supernatural horror thriller. The performances sort of hold the movie together. The Anasazi background was pretty interesting and the visuals surrounding that were creepy. The whole imaginary friend angle was never explained. Other than that The Darkness is pretty standard--lower standard that is."
