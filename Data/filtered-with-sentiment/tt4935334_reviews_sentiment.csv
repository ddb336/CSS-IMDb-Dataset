" A trip thru hell - WOW
",-0.0173,-0.7787,2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,Movies like this -- ones that form an atmosphere of hell with no hope to leave. Demons and the devil in carnate lurking.The hospital scene will stay with me for a very long time. Incredibly well done. The cackling laughter was horrific.
" If you enjoy Creepshow you'll enjoy this!
",0.7712,0.8928,2021-03-28 00:00:00,6,Very entertaining and lots of thrills. Ties in from start to end. Would have given it higher rating if they covered the other stories but only tied in the first story from the movie from what I saw. Nevertheless this was a very good film def recommend watching it!
" Could have been a winner!
",0.6239,-0.5499,2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,Smashing try but the production team could have hit a spectacular home run if they had conquered whatever problems they had during filming.
" A middle of the road horror anthology
",-0.5719,-0.8637,2021-03-08 00:00:00,6,"I watched this a couple of years ago and at the time a gave it a weak 5/10. After re-watching it last night I changed my mind a little bit. But not by much. Southbound has potential but unfortunately the film do not succeed in most aspects. Everything from writing to directing is pretty average all around.
I think my biggest problem is that the movies plot is in a bit of a limbo. It explains a bit too much while at the same time it explains too little. There is nothing wrong with the underlying themes that connects the stories but some of the practical plot things are a bit weird. Some stories are connected and some are not. And when it connects the stories it does it in a bit of an unintuitive way. The wrapper does the same thing.If you are a horror anthology fan I would say: Sure, watch it if you have nothing better to do. Otherwise you can skip it. A better alternative would be VHS 2. It's better in every aspect and arguably best in the series."
" Unique and Effective Horror
",-0.1531,-0.9889,2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie is both hard to watch and hard to look away from. It is absurd, gritty, and mesmerizing. There is some significant gore here, so viewer beware.There are some better and worse stories in this connected anthology. The following pertains to them all, especially Lucas's.The fact that this film is so absurd is sickeningly evil in itself. This is true horror. Imagine if you woke up tomorrow and reality just melted away. It's my worst fear, a very deep and existential one, and one that this movie has tapped in a vile way. The scariest moment I had in my life was in the amnesia following a bad concussion. I didn't know who or where I was. I thought I was in hell. If that feeling can be experienced through cinema, this movie has done it.For comparison, this movie reminds me of Rubber in an odd way. Maybe it's the desert setting, feverish plot, and deadpan gore. I'm tempted to say this is to horror what Rubber is to black humor.If to know what this movie feels like to watch, I'd say picture some type of David Lynch-Tarantino-Rod Sterling lovechild presented as a sickening feverdream. Oh, and lots of gore."
" Southbound - A classic horror on the (end of) highway movie. Low budget, high creativity.
",-0.4939,0.7541,2021-02-03 00:00:00,6,"Southbound is a movie made up of 5 interwoven tales, and the movie manages in bringing its idea cross. We also get some closure on what at beginning of the move seems paradox, or supernatural.I was a bit reminded of the first Reeker movie, when it comes to perplexed people having to find out what is going on and why. Another vague association was the movie Identity.My personal suspicion is that younger people may find it harder to feel entertained by the movie, as we older ones have more associations and memories compatible along with it.The movie is NOT hyping any racism of Dixieland aka the former Confederate states of the USA. I call it the kinda movie, which could deserve fans funding a sequel. No masterpiece, but solid enough to enjoy watching."
" All Roads Lead Southbound
",0.0,-0.9783,2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Which makes a whole lot of sense since It seems like all our characters are in purgatory. They are hopelessly lost or have committed heinous crimes, and they are now in a place where they cannot escape, or a are stuck in an endless loop.Wraith demons appear from the start of the film, and look like they are after souls or waiting about for death. Which is why they seem to appear spontaneously throughout the film when bad things are about to happen.Southbound is an anthology that follows a different set of characters through five interlocking stories that are all linked to the main plot, and by the end everything seems to come together nicely in one big circle.I'll admit the film is pretty well done. It speeds through the stories quickly, it was intriguing, and full of mystery and action, and so while you want to find out more of a previous tale, you don't the chance to stop, reflect and catch your breath.I actually wish more films were done like this. There will always be pros and cons but the film did what it intended. It had a story, It was interesting, it had gore, it has mystery, it did have some gritty and unsettling moments, and it fits in very nicely to the horror genre.The only real negative I can say about this film is that it doesn't delve deep into the character development. We don't know much backstory, and what has transpired in the past. And therefore your connection with the characters is not as strong as it could be.However, something always seems to catch up with them. And even though there is a lot that we aren't aware of, most of it doesn't really matter since you can get a good enough grasp on the situation, and can sense that in the end the final outcomes will all be unpleasant.A quick note on the hospital scene which was one of the most brutal, visceral and disgusting scenes I think I have ever witnessed in a movie to date but it also kept you firmly in shock, and on the edge of your seat.We get wraithlike skeletons, cults, murderers, a creepy abandoned hospital, some really weird townsfolk, and some monster elements sprinkled into the five stories. The DJ was a really nice touch and effortlessly blended into when a short story ended and when the next one began.This is one of those surprise horror movies that actually has a fulfilling story and decent ending. Definitely watch this film if you are a horror fan. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.7/10"
" The damned do not grow old
",-0.3818,-0.9819,2020-12-21 00:00:00,7,"In the end it came full circle for the first and the last stories. Two guys stopped at a gas station. They're covered in blood and one of them is wounded. They were running away from a flying demon. The wounded gets killed brutally his jaw crushed and the other ran away and finds himself running for his daughter asking for help on and on and on. They attacked a family in their new house and killed three of them showing his daughters picture to the father of the house. They spared the girl but she came back and wounded them and the earth collapsed and the tentacles coming out took the third man in the funny masks. Then the dead family members turned into the flying demons and they ran the collapsing earth and them ending up at the gas station where one of them got killed. The second story was about a girl band who got a flat in the middle of nowhere and was helped by a couple which seemed to be stuck in the past. They were served a nasty looking roast and the two are it and started to throw up black stuff and they were made good by sipping something they were served and become some robots. At the dinner the twin guys and the other family all seemed to teleported from the old word and scary. And the one that didn't eat woke up to see that they were conducting an occult ritual. After saving herself from the trap she stepped on she got away but hit by a car in the middle of the road very harshly. The driver was on the phone but helped her by calling 911. The three people talked thru him saying he had to take her himself to the nearest hospital at the town ahead. He found the hospital which seemed abandoned and old and had to operate on by himself with instructions on the phone. It was pretty gore seeing him entubing her with bare hands and slit her torso to get to her collapsed lung and she died. She negotiated with the ones on the phone saying he didn't deserve this that's not his fault and he was spared and the locked doors of the creppy hospital were opened. He found clean clothes at the locker room and a brand new car and brand new of everything he has. He got on his new car with all his belonging inside and hit the road. Then the woman on the phone in the town that talked to the man that was spared got into a bar and after that a man came in saying where his lover is. He threatened with a gun and convinced the bartender to come and show where she is. He before that shot the werewolf like man in the hand. They found her at a tattoo parlor working and both hit the road and the desert after the road ended. She said she killed them on purpose so she had to be here and not him. The naked demons in the desert took him and she got back. She said he got old and he replied he had been looking for her for 13 years. The damned do not grow old as the others. At some places it became too surreal but it was fun to watch in the end and I knew the guys with funny ""purge"" masks were the guys at the first story."
" GREAT GORE/FUN MOVIE
",0.6249,0.902,2020-11-22 00:00:00,8,"I had zero expectations going into this movie. I am glad I didn't because I really enjoyed it. I had no idea this movie had several stories interwoven together. So when I saw the first story, I wasn't thrilled that I'd be watching an entire feature film with the two characters. But once the skeleton, spirit thing shoved his arm down the dudes throat, I was down.Fun movie, GREAT gore, pretty solid acting. The different stories are very well thought out, and all of them have that ""hmmmm WHAT?!"" aspect to them.This film is sort of like a horror version of The Twilight Zone. If you're expecting to have the story easily explained to you, and you're one to get bored easily, then this movie isn't for you.If you like to use your brain and think about what is going on in the film, this is for you.I don't know how anyone can rate this under a 6 after watching the car accident scene. You people suck!"
" You have to pay attention to every word.
",-0.1027,-0.993,2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,"As with most anthologies, this one has some good segments and some so-so segments. The common theme appears to be that the characters are being punished for something they did or failed to do in their past. Some are in hell, some are entering hell, and one escapes hell. (They may also be in purgatory since a radio announcer says at least once that they can make up for their past mistakes.) You have to listen carefully to everything that is said to get a feel for the backstories of the characters which are not fleshed out.The two guys who begin and end the anthology are trying to escape punishment for their murder of a family. Their original intent seems to be revenge for something the father did but revenge goes too far and the family is murdered. The only hint that we get about the reason for the revenge is the father saying repeatedly ""I'm sorry."" One of the intruders then whispers something in the wife's ear that prompts here to say ""You told?"" to the father. This appears to have something to do with a small child named Katherine. The two guys say in the opening story that their actions were ""for Catherine."" One of the two guys then encounters a running child (his daughter?) in a hotel room who yells that he he didn't protect her.The three girls driving down the road did something to, or failed to do something for, the unseen fourth member of their group. We only get some references about their missing fourth band member along with accusations and excuses about her fate. It sounds like they left her behind when they shouldn't have. Their punishment is to fall into the hands of a cult. Two of them become victims of the cult. The third one ""escapes"" only to then be hit by a car as she runs away. She later dies so she also oesn't escape the consequences of whatever they did or didn't do to the fourth band member.The guy who hits the girl is on his way home on the deserted desert highway ""in the middle of nowhere"" that serves to tie the stories together. He doesn't know what to do immediately after he hits her and it looks like he briefly considers leaving the girl but then decides to help her. He goes through some grisly experiences futilely trying to save the girl based on instructions given to him by unidentified voices. That is his punishment for briefly thinking about leaving the girl and driving off. He is then allowed to continue his drive as if nothing has happened.The unidentified voice or voices turns out to be a woman in a phone booth who is pretending to be a paramedic and a doctor. She gets off the phone and walks into a bar. She and the other people in the bar appear to be demons in the form of humans. A man with a shotgun walks in is looking for his long lost sister. He can hurt the demons but he can't kill them. One of the demons takes him to his daughter and he forces her to leave with him. She reminds him that she killed their parents, that she is happy where she is, and that his taking her is for his benefit not hers. He doesn't listen and he is punished for his trying to rescue her from hell (or purgatory).All of this is perhaps obvious to other viewers but it took me a while to figure out why the family was attacked and why the hit and run driver was allowed to leave. This anthology isn't a blockbusting horror film but it has its moments."
" This movie blows
",0.0,-0.9291,2020-11-12 00:00:00,1,This is one of the worst movies ever. It says there are 5 interconnected tales? I counted four and only the first and last were connected and only in a completely stupid way. Please kill me before you waste my time with this garbage again.
" Fun and gory

" Meh...
",0.0,-0.8175,2020-09-24 00:00:00,7,"It becomes apparent right from the start that the travelers on this road are in some sort of hell, or at least purgatory. The movie consists of several short stories, each concerning people traveling along a dessert road and encountering some form of bizarre horrific situation.
The people the travlers encounter appear to be demons, at least thats my best guess.
My problem with the movie is that the stories felt incomplete and maybe thats by design, but ultimately it left me feeling unfulfilled."
" Pretty good

" Worthy of a big screen debut
",0.4404,-0.1632,2020-07-14 00:00:00,7,"I would admit this movie needs some polishing which would undoubtedly be a box office hit. I was at the edge of my seat wanting to know if the characters are going to get some sort of justice for their suffering. Very unique, nothing like the thrillers in theaters wanting my $13.50"
" A twisted wild ride

The production, script and performances are decent, despite there being no kind of plot or underlying story. There's some dark humor tossed in here and there and there's enough freaky to make any horror fan content. I liked it."
" Finally a great anthology horror movie!!!

This is a movie Stephen king would make!! With a little tobe Hooper thrown in or actually a John carpenter film!! Watch and then watch again. I'm so glad I purchased the bluray.
" Entertaining Mixed Bag
",0.4404,0.8979,2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"Southbound, like just about every anthology out there, has a fair mix of good stories and mediocre ones. It begins with one of the weaker ones - two men on the run from floating alien/skeleton looking creatures in the desert who keep winding up back at the same desolate cafe. From there, we get to one of the better and creepier stories where a girl band breaks down on the side of the road on the way to a gig and are taken in by a kindly couple who seem to be hiding a sinister secret.After that, you have a story about a man who hits a body in the middle of the road and tries desperately to save them. Rounding up the film are a story about a man looking for his lost sister in a creepy town and a family experiencing a home invasion while on vacation.Southbound places its two best stories (the girl band and the hit and run) right in the middle of the film, but even those have a few issues. Thankfully, the atmosphere, cinematography, and acting are so on point that you can just shrug off any plot issues to the dreamlike nature of the film. They're definitely memorable and will stay in your head for a while."
" When I Was Kid...
",0.0,-0.9415,2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"... my dad would take us on drives through wooded areas. With the headlights shining on skeletal trees, I would be terrified in the back seat and image all sorts of terrible things happening like something horrible being glimpsed sound the side of the road or running in from of the headlights. So even today I'm afraid of lonely roads at night and movies grating such drives.In this anthology series there's a lonely, unidentified road in the middle of no where often driven at night. This isn't really scary. It's more gory than scary. One story leads into another, but each story is different.The weakest story was the one with the girls. A couple picks them up and at least one girl (they're a band with a missing member) doesn't want to go knowing it'll come to no good and it doesn't of course, but satanists? Really?The goriest is the third act. When you watch it, you'll see what I mean. All of these people have something evil or wrong in their backgrounds, some never revealed, some hinted at, others no clue given.The first and last tie in. What do you think dad did? Methinks mom and dad didn't have to worry about daughter taking care of herself. She was relatable capable."
" Surprisingly good!

The reaper floating things in the beginning were a bit of a turn off at first, and I thought it was just going to be a lame effects movie with a weird storyline that never really explained itself.It's an anthology of sorts and after the second story gets started it sucks you right in and keeps you there until the end. It was fun and inventive."

I know people are saying it should be like this (all over the place and open ended!) I know the Stephen king philosophy of saying open ended stats with you longer and all that jazz.....If I were to write a horror movie I would have done similar but with this premise for a free roam hell scenario you could have made it more terrifying and not just creepy scary (think goosebumps bumped up!) if I had wrote it I also would have tied it in for you better. So it made at least 10% sense lolBut I didn't regret enjoying it I just don't certainly rate it 10/10 come on guys have you seen a 10/10 horror movie!

" Outstanding Low-Budget RoadTrip Horror. Scary.
",-0.4404,-0.9867,2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"Yeah, I know, this is a ridiculous horror movie (although, really entertaining and well-made)... It's not real. It's not plausible. But, here is what IS real and plausible -You never really know who is driving that old pick-up truck behind you, or that car with expired tags up in front of you on the highway. You don't know their story, or where they are going, or where they have been. But, if you think about it, what you DO know is that criminals with warrants cannot buy plane tickets, or show an ID to take a train... And, criminals with warrants don't hang out on city streets and deal with local police. Criminals travel in normal vehicles on interstate highways.And, when you decide to stay at that local motel because it's cheaper, you never really know who is staying in the next room, or watching the front of the motel from the diner across the street. But, if you think about it a little, what you DO know is that criminals don't want the scrutiny of a big hotel chain and cameras everywhere... Also, criminals are sometimes desperate for cash and need to save money... You might not know this, but a lot of illegal business is conducted in motel rooms.Some things to consider on your next road trip.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Because I could find nothing of merit in it.As some other harsh critics have pointed out, the chaining multiple stories together seems like a concept with potential, but to make it work you'd have to do something interesting with it.As individual short stories in the horror genre, they were all extremely poorly done. It's like everyone, especially the director, was phoning it in. There was no suspense. Just one thing after another that evoked a ""well, that was certainly uninspired"" reaction. If this was the first film by someone doing a project for his/her middle school class, it would be acceptable. Not from a grownup filmmaker.Definitely one of the small handful of worst movies I have ever watched."

" An interesting ride down this anthology highway.
",0.4019,0.9759,2019-12-05 00:00:00,6,"I didn't expect to be blown away by a film like this. It's a low budget horror anthology and I'm not much of a horror fan.That being said, I appreciate the filmmakers for doing something interesting with this. There are a lot of interesting ideas going on in this movie. I appreciate that none of the stories are really explained. You can infer the backgrounds of some of the situations, where others are left much more open ended. Horror works best when it isn't spelled out, and this was a film that left me thinking for hours afterwords, piecing together the connections of what I watched.The creators did a Reddit AMA a while back and this quote from writer/actor Matt Bettinelli-Olpin made me appreciate the film more.
""write something that excites you and that no one else could make. try to be as unique as you are. get your friends to help. if you can get funding, great! if you can't, don't worry...write something that fits the budget you have to work with and tell a story that energizes you.""This feels like a good summation of this film."
" Rotten Roadkill
",-0.5106,-0.9671,2019-11-19 00:00:00,2,"This movie sells itself as a horror anthology featuring ""five interlocking tales of terror"" but in reality only about half the stories are actually connected and the terror went out for a ride and never came back.The movie feels like a bunch of deleted scenes taken from other movies and mashed together. Most of stories are linked kind of like this: we follow a person A who walks by person B and now we start following person B; or we step out of the hotel room of person A and step into the room next door to start following person B for no reason. There is no interaction between person A or B (with a few exceptions) which makes most of these connection meaningless and does not enhance the overall narrative (if there is meant to be one).None of the characters are memorable and the film doesn't make any effort to develop them or make the audience care about them. It's just a number of random people doing random pointless things. We follow one group, then we follow another group which has no relation to the first group, and now we follow another random person who just happened to be nearby. Why should the viewer care what happens to any of them?The writing and acting was cringe-worthy and hilarious at times. The CGI was hard to look at. The gore was actually ok. The camera was often too shaky and annoying and they often filmed with a wide lens which distorted the picture on either side of the screen. The movie does not rely on jump scares but at the same time it doesn't do anything an average horror-viewer hasn't seen before. The R-rating feels wasted on it.This is what the honest movie description should say: ""Five loosely connected tales of boredom that follow the fates of forgettable strangers who find themselves in random predicaments over one very long and tedious night on a desolate stretch of desert highway."" At least they got the part about the highway right!Skip this movie and go watch Trick 'r Treat (2007) to see a fun horror anthology done right, where the stories actually connect meaningfully, and the characters get some development in the little time they are given on screen.The scariest thing about this movie is how many people seem to think that this is good horror. I don't know how this movie got so many high ratings or which parallel universe those reviewers came from, but Southbound doesn't do anything new or interesting and is ultimately just a disappointing messy roadkill that even a family of demon-worshiping cannibals would not enjoy."
" Effective horror anthology ...
",-0.1531,0.5148,2019-11-14 00:00:00,7,"The makers of 2012's anthology frightener 'V/H/S' get together again for this further compendium of horror pieces. Not only does the collection work very well, providing snippets of stories rather than full stories themselves, the but there is a very clever 'wraparound' arc that doesn't become apparent until the final chapter. This arc alone is a good reason to watch 'Southbound' more than once, to see how many more intricately placed 'clues' can be found as to the resolution.To go into detail of these stories would venture too much into spoiler territory for my liking, but my favourite story would either be the very first (featuring some nice wraith-like creatures, which turn up throughout the film) or the story involving a gruesomely injured girl found on a roadside.There are some very nice, seedy settings here - an unnervingly empty hospital, a wide open desert setting - even 1962 classic 'Carnival of Souls' gets an airing.There is a deliberate policy not to heavily signpost the ending of one story and the beginning of another, making the transition from one horror to another rather murky, much in the style of the story segments.
Apart from anything else, the presentation of 'Southbound', as well as the stories themselves, presents something a little different in the horror movie genre. My score is 7 out of 10."
" NEVER ENDING TALE(S)
",0.0,-0.7999,2019-11-10 00:00:00,6,Lame anthology film. The whole plot was confusing in a loop scene and leaving clueless on what's going on. Neverending tale(s). Not a fan.

" Attempt to create an anthologic movie that ends up to be very confusing and inconclusive
",-0.024,-0.9487,2019-10-16 00:00:00,4,"I really love the anthology horror movie format, because I think is more dynamic, it can tell and develop better stories, without boring the audience, that is very common nowadays with stretched films that have useless scenes or characters, just to hit the hour and a half standard length. I really appreciated how the five different tales were slightly connected. Directors really worked together to create consistency.The problem with the movie is that every tale that you see, has a backstory, that is not explained, so you do not really get why someone do something, why these characters are stuck in this parallel world? They did something wrong? Is this some kind of punishment for their actions? You won't get any answer. What you are going to watch are basically a bunch of nonsense killings. If only they've at least try to give an explanation, I would have given a better rating.Acting was almost always decent, except in the ""Siren"" tale, that was absolutely awful and not credible at all. In general, do not expect class-A actors.
I have to admit that photography, framing and the CGI effects are solid. Especially supernatural creatures, are different from the average horror movie monster and really creepy. Unfortunately this alone, does not make Southbound a good film."
" An adept addition to horror anthology
",-0.5719,0.6668,2019-09-14 00:00:00,9,"During the past decade, horror anthology has become my favorite sub-genre within the horror realm. Southbound is a terrific addition to the collection, standing next some of the best, such as Trick 'R Treat. Each act is timely placed and tells its story without feeling drawn out or too short. It left me wanting more. Namely, what are the backstories to each set of characters? We glean pieces of each, like a puzzle with only the boarder complete, but I would have happily watched 20 more minutes to see Bettinelli-Olpin's depiction. In the end it lies on us to make our own inferences. I'll be watching this again in the future."

It's a standout for sure. It's unique and keeps you watching.I like how this film ties in all the characters and stories. It's all done pretty seamlessly too. If you're looking good horror film without the jump scares, then this is the one for you. It's definitely a winner."
" Very Creepy, but suffers the same fate as many horror films-No Real Conclusion
",-0.8909,-0.7434,2019-07-29 00:00:00,6,"This is an entertaining flick, and hits the spot on many notes, but it just doesn't tie everything together in a sensible fashion or satisfying conclusion. You have several anthology stories that take place on this road to nowhere, but in the end, the movie itself leads to nowhere. I was able to satisfy myself by saying that this whole world in the film is a ""NIght Gallery"" or ""Twilight Zone"" throwback to episodes where people were in Hell or Limbo, basically, but this is never satisfactorily proven, and events from each short story don't link up that well.The atmosphere is great, the film is creepy, there are numerous tropes from classic horror films that work well here, and there was potential for this to be a true masterpiece. It seems the writers had a really good idea, but couldn't come up with an original ending or overarching theme, or ran out of funds. The girl band getting kidnapped by a cult of weird people was cool, but what the hell does it have to do with any of the other stories, or the flying demon things? The guy hitting one of the girls on the highway and going to the hospital was a tense situation, but why is no one around, and why is his phone call answered by some bag lady in a phone booth? Why is the fat guy in the bar able to attack a gunman with some weird lobster hand? Are they all just demons tormenting people??? Why do albino naked people attack the shotgun-wielding dude who came to save his sister? Are they just forms of the other flying demons? What were the three masked killers truly after, when they attacked the family at night? They said it was for the dude's daughter, but they never seemed to steal anything or explain how it was beneficial, and the dying man who was stabbed seems to allude to the fact that he wronged them and is sorry, but this is never really explained in any way, and then the film ends abruptly.The only conclusion one could possibly draw, is that this is some sort of Hell on Repeat, or a bad dream that you might have which truly bewilders and terrifies you, but has no true meaning-- just jumbled parts and fears from your inner mind and soul. This one will keep you guessing and keep you thrilled, which is great, but unfortunately, it will keep you guessing after the credits, and let you down on meaning."

",0.0,0.8638,2019-06-11 00:00:00,6,"This thriller anthology is smartly done, indeed. Unlike many similar movies that employ a narrator to bookend the various stories, Southbound subtly connects each tale to the next. Each is based somewhere in California's desert wilderness, but the stories vary in theme and execution. Gangsters on the run from a supernatural entity bent on revenge. A band stranded on an unnamed highway gets rescued by a clean-cut couple. A man on his way home has to care for a woman he's just accidentally hit with his car. Another man wanders into a mysterious bar, looking for his long-lost sister. And a family on vacation pays for the sins of the father. Each episode is very well told, and although each was directed by a different person, none employed a style that varied much from the others. Entertaining, gory, profane, and loads of fun."

But the second part was rather dull and not original, while the third part ""The Accident"" was sickening to watch - probably only the worst sadistic psychopath could actually enjoy watching it.Perhaps the first and the last, which is a prequel to the first, could have been made into one full-length movie.

This is a film that could have easily come out back in the 70s 80s and even has that grindhouse look and feel and feel especially with the score. I highly recommend this one check it out !"

The director makes a point to give you the ability to interpet this movie the way you want, and delivers it with a sort of ""Fellini meets Freddies Nightmares"" attitude. If you need explanations to justify your viewing experiences, this probably isn't the type for you. He takes you on and interesting journey that ends as it begins with decent actors and a professional delivery. I'm certain and hopeful to see more from this director."

" Finish your script first, then make the film!
",0.0,-0.3637,2018-03-27 00:00:00,1,"Films like ""Southbound"" make me mad. Seriously mad, even, because they enhance the dreadful misconception that horror movies nowadays don't require a good script or a coherent plot if there's a cool gimmick (in this case interlacing segments) and lots of gory special effects. What makes these so-called writers and directors (including the collective ""Radio Silence"" or whatever they call themselves) think they are permitted to just put together a bunch of semi-processed ideas and underdeveloped storylines, but then sell it as a brimful anthology? I'll be the first to admit that the concept of ""Southbound"" demonstrates a lot of potential, but every segment feels incomplete and raises multiple questions rather than providing thrills and entertainment. In the first segment: what the heck are these skeletal creatures supposed to be and why are these two blokes trapped in a sort of time warp? During the second chapter: what ever happened to the fourth girl the others keep referring to? Who are their assailants and what drives them? One girl escapes, but what's the fate of the other two? The third segment is the most satisfying, but still: why is the hospital abandoned and who are the voices on the phone? Segment four is the most frustrating of them all and I can't even begin to describe what the purpose of this tale is. The final story is a prelude to the first but doesn't clarify anything. We still don't know about the background of these people and we're still guessing what the skeletal creatures are. For some incomprehensible reason, ""Southbound"" has quite a large fan-base and surely the geeks love to endlessly debate about alternate dimension theories, hidden clues, suggestive backgrounds, etc... This isn't cinema in the league of David Lynch; - it's only a mediocre and overly pretentious horror anthology. I would normally give a rating 4 or even 5, because the special effects are admirably gruesome and there certainly are a handful of atmospherically tense moments, but the lack of screenplay is so infuriating that I stick to the minimum rating. Consider it a statement."

They enter into a classic Twilight Zone episode where they always wind up at the same diner no matter where they go. Yes, they encounter demons, and quite wicked looking ones at that as this tale shifts into another and another and finally, as expected weaves itself back to fill in the gaps of the first tale.If you haven't figured out from the title and DVD artwork what is going on, then I apologize for the plot spoilers as it seems Hell is being stuck in the 50's. The tales are a fairly decent collection, although I wish they had fewer of them and with more depth. Good radio announcer.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."

",-0.2023,0.8199,2017-12-17 00:00:00,6,"SOUTHBOUND is a solid little horror anthology consisting of five interlocking tales about travellers encountering monstrous nastiness deep in the desert. I found it much better than expected; a B-movie for sure, but one which delivers plenty of bodily fluids and slime for the gore fans, as well as some creepy scenarios and a budget that does justice to the sometimes imaginative set-ups. The opening sequence is particularly creepy, with the sight of those winged skeletal things enough to send shivers down the spine; if anything, the subsequent tales get darker and darker until they reach a pitch-black level."

And you will, too, as long as you like horror classics, short stories, and some gore.Everyone loved the one of the accident the most. I liked them all. But I will not spoil a thing. I will tell you, though, that there is a bit of predictability if you are a hardcore fan, and that you are going to be scared no matter what type of fan you are.Could it have been better? Well, I gave it an 8 for a reason. It is, by no means, a masterpiece. But then again, if we look at the budget and what this movie aims to achieve, I should have given it 11 points.It is a good movie for a date night, or for any night that caught you in the mood for classic horror."

Weird. I feel like I just said this moments ago. Never mind.Before we start, what I don't understand is why people are complaining about the stories being insufficiently explained. Those people obviously don't realize what makes a good horror movie. Let me remind you of what Stephen King once wrote - ""Nightmares exist outside of logic, and there's little fun to be had in explanations; they're antithetical to the poetry of fear."" In a good horror story, there shouldn't be an explanation. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest. Besides, if you pay enough attention while watching the movie, you'll get every explanation you need (spoilers ahead): *SPOILER ALERT!!!* The movie is actually set in Hell, represented by a highway in the middle of nowhere, and it tells the stories of the people who are suffering an eternity in a loop there by showing why they landed there in the first place. It's a haunting collection of tales of constant agony of reliving the sins and personal horrors of every character. Every bit of cleverly placed foreshadowing detail about the characters and their sins reveals so much about who they are as people, and this tied in with their actions and behavior serve to tell a complete, full story about each and every one of them. And that's what makes this movie a storytelling masterpiece. It makes you use your head, think, ponder, realize, and ultimately reflect on every single second of it.*SPOILERS END HERE!!!* To sum it all up, if you want something other than a generic, mass-produced, slasher/creature feature horror movie that actually has a deeper meaning and makes you think, then look no further, and go watch this movie.

",0.6249,0.8989,2017-08-19 00:00:00,6,***MINOR SPOILER ALERT***This is the kind of anthology series where you just sit back and enjoy the show. It weaves a few stories seamlessly together. So well in fact you don't exactly know where one ends and the other begins. But if it's comprehension you're looking for...its not there. Featuring some good gore intertwined with some shotty CGI....they blend together like an old 80s movie. What this movie does have is speed. You're zoomed through the story lines with such speed you don't really have time to get bored. I would say probably the first two stories are the slowest. However they get you prepped for the second and third acts which normally are where a film fails. Exact opposite with this film.I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Despite some stories being a tad baffling and void of reason....I give it a solid 6 ******.

The thread that ties these stories together is that these people deserve to be here or play some part in this world. I like that the filmmakers don't see fit to explain why they belong there: once the premise is established, you assume they belong and don't need to know any more about it. It's almost fun how they avoid over-explaining. The acting was good, the creepy moments were sufficiently creepy, the gory moments sufficiently gory, and despite not giving you much to connect to, the characters are portrayed in a way that you can root for or against them.I think the filmmakers set themselves a common thread and were able to tie the four separate stories together expertly.

Maybe i just have very high standards, but i hoped that the stories would be more connected to each other. The dialogue was weird enough to feel unease which i'm not really sure that's good or not.

""Southbound"" is a film with sketches and in these 5 stories, there will be good and at least good. But there are nevertheless good things to see and some nice effects re mainly in the hospital, this passage is really to see and just as the film can be seen without too many problems, in view of so much turnip. I know there's better, but it's still worth seeing once."
" Engaging 5 story horror anthology
",-0.3182,-0.7796,2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. There are 5 different tales of death, and the writers tried to leave back stories out and connect each story to the next. What they did though was not connect the stories rather, lead to the other with perhaps one character from the end of one tale to start the next tale. There were not many jump out of your seat scary parts so these are just good throwback stories with a bit of suspense to them. I think the writers would have done better to give some of the character back stories, and perhaps give them a chance. I would have liked it better if more of their struggle to survive was shown, rather than, you're marked for death so you die. Also the mysterious ways they die and reason they are marked leaves much to the imagination, good or bad."

Being a huge fan of anthologies I gave this a go blindly, after not hearing much about it, and was pleasantly surprised.Southbound features five loosely related stories all taking in the same desolate area. It will leave you with both haunting imagery and interesting train of though. I, however, came away wanting more clarification due to a rather unexplained plot and an ending which also doesn't explain much. Despite the low budget, Southbound is clearly well thought out, if slightly secretive, and very well designed. If you are a big fan of anthology horrors like me then I think you will probably be a big fan of this."

The other guy goes back to the motel where he starts hearing and seeing his daughter and encounters the thing.In a different room at the motel three girls from a band leave and end up with a flat tire somewhere and without a spare. A friendly old-fashioned couple gives them a lift. During dinner another couple comes over with their twin sons. Two of the girls eat some nasty looking meat dish, the third girl is a vegetarian. Later the two end up vomiting some black stuff and late at night simply walk outside in the dark. The other girl follows them and sees them joining some ceremony. All the others are in robes and chanting. At some point they discover her and chase her as she runs to the street.And is hit by a car. The driver calls 911 but doesn't know where he is or where he is going. He decides to drive to a city nearby, goes into a hospital, which is completely empty. The dispatcher, EMT, and now a doctor are on the phone and guiding him. He's told to intubate the girl by hand, and then manually to compress her lung. He does so and eventually he allowed to leave.Nearby a woman is on the phone, I think she may have been one of the people talking to the guy. She goes into a bar where later a guy with a shotgun breaks in and asks if anyone has seen his missing daughter. After several scuffles, the guy at the bar takes him to a tattoo parlor where the daughter works. Against her will, the brother takes her with him and they drive away, but where to? The brother faces a nasty while the girl drives back and goes into a restroom.From it a girl exits and joins her family eating. They go to a vacation house where soon enough 3 masked guys appear. The break into the house and grab the couple. The daughter hid and is safe. By accident they end up killing the couple, and attack the daughter, but now things turn very surprising. Among the surprises, two of the masked guys are the guys from the beginning in the truck.Southbound presents these interesting and creepy stories. Each story poses more questions than it answers. And in this case it worked. Others here on the boards have come up with excellent explanations. Perhaps one problem with Southbound is that it didn't intrigue me enough to try and come up with answers. I was perfectly content with not knowing how it all comes together, or whether it does, but apparently it does. So a lot of thought went into these scripts but not enough clues were offered to the audience or it wasn't made clear that they were clues. In any case, I enjoyed Southbound. It's a different, original, interesting movie that sets quite an atmosphere. I found the creature thing to be very neat and different, as well. The cast was mostly unknown to me but Nathalie Love and Hassie Harrison are just lovely."

They didn't rely on cheap cats jumping into scene or the millions of other generic ways to get people out of their seats. I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan. The 3rd story made me feel really uncomfortable and cringe yet couldn't stop watching. VHS was OK and I feel like that's where they cut their teeth, southbound is where they got everything right. The angels of death 💀 are some of the coolest I ever seen in a movie. Creep to say the least. The girl I watched this with literally curled up in a fetal position while watching this and she's a horror fan like me albeit not as rabid."
