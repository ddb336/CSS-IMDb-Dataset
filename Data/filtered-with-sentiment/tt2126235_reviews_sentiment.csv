" Unexpected surprise
",0.2732,0.8881,2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I DVR'd this movie based on the description alone knowing nothing else about it. To my great surprise it has Nicholas Hoult, Sir Ben Kingsley AND Sir Anthony Hopkins. Do you really need any more motivation? Watch thes actors do their thing with a fair to middling script, and you will see how a great actor in a poor scene can elevate the whole shebang!"
" Better than the reviews suggest
",0.4404,0.8717,2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Seriously, what's not to like? Action, car chases, two knights chewing up the scenery and an engaging leading couple. SOOOO much better than I expected. Great fun."
" Romantic comedy
",0.6369,0.9895,2021-03-09 00:00:00,6,I think this makes the perfect romantic comedy film to bring your girl out. Lots of love motivates a guy to get rich quick by stealing the big mobster and get lucky along the way. The love is romantic and the luck is comedy. Great chase to make the romance palatable to the guys.
" Decent Enough

" Never Judge a Book by Its Cover
",0.0,-0.9862,2021-01-24 00:00:00,3,"Never judge a book by its cover, or a movie by the big names on the poster. My wife and I were reminded of this adage last weekend when we were flicking through the TV schedules and decided to watch ""Collide"", largely because of the words ""starring Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins"". Bad move.The film is about two young Americans living in Germany. Both characters, in fact, are played by British actors, Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones, who were cast after Zac Efron and Amber Heard dropped out. (Good move). A young man named Casey meets a girl named Juliette in a bar, but she wants nothing to do with him as she knows that he works for a Turkish-born drug dealer named Geran. Casey is so smitten that he quits Geran's gang and finds more lawful employment. Juliette's prejudices against drug dealers to not extend to those who have retired from the business and the two begin dating and eventually start living together together.And then Juliette is taken ill, and it is discovered that she needs a kidney transplant. Because of doubts about her immigration status, she does not qualify for the operation in Germany, and she does not have the money to pay for it in America. To raise the money Casey goes back to work for Geran, who wants him for a special job. As this job involves stealing drugs belonging to a much more powerful drug lord named Hagen Kahl, who is noted for his ruthlessness, Casey finds that he has put himself and Juliette in great danger. (This is why Juliette had to be American. Had the character been British she could have returned home and had the operation free of charge on the National Health. So why are so many Americans opposed to the idea of a state-run health service?)By coincidence, this was one of two modern British crime thrillers made in the late 2010s and set, or partly set, in Germany, which I have watched recently, the other being ""The Good Liar"". Both films star two senior members of the British acting profession, all of them now in their seventies or eighties, Hopkins and Kingsley here and Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren in ""The Good Liar"". Of the two, ""The Good Liar"" is by far the better. It is not a perfect film- the script and plotting leave a lot to be desired- but it does contain two excellent performances from the two leading actors.Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for ""Collide"". It is, by a considerable margin, the worst film I have ever seen starring Hopkins (the previous holder of that title being Oliver Stone's clunking classical epic ""Alexander""). It is not quite the worst film I have ever seen starring Kingsley, but it is the worst since the appalling ""Harem"" from the mid-eighties. Kingsley is admittedly an actor whose work can vary in quality; his career has contained some notable peaks such as ""Gandhi"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Twelfth Night"" and ""Shutter Island"", but it has also contained some troughs, and the dreadful performance he gives here as Geran must count as one of the deepest of these. Hopkins has generally been more consistent in quality throughout his career, but even he does not shine here. His Kahl is strangely bland and disappointing, insufficiently menacing for a supposedly ruthless drug baron.The other big problem with the film is that it does not contain any character with whom we can sympathise. Yes, I know we are supposed to be rooting for Casey, but I find it difficult to root for a drug dealer, even a reformed drug dealer who has slipped back into his old ways out of supposedly noble motives. (And Casey did not give up drug dealing out of remorse or conscience; he did so because it was the only way he could get Juliette to sleep with him). The script is badly written and the plot frequently does not make a lot of sense. About the only redeeming feature of this film is that the frequent car chase and car crash scenes are well handled. And with a title like ""Collide"" that seems entirely appropriate. 3/10"
" Bullet proof cars and overloud effects
",0.0,-0.9208,2021-01-20 00:00:00,4,"It may be a fairly mindless action film, but even with that there is a limit about how much you can suspend belief.Car doors do not stop bullets - very little of a car will stop bullets - so this gets silly very quickly, Small pistols to practically rocket launchers are firsed at ordinary cars and the worst that happens, most of the time, is that the side windows break - NEVER the front windscreen - only the sides. Which break several times in on sequence.Cars do crash and catch fire, but that is no surprise because no-one seems to be in them.The to compound all this, after half an hour of actors whispering at each other, the chase sequences are absurdly loud.Not a film for anyone over about 10."

" Surprisingly engaging action thriller
",0.6124,0.9955,2020-10-02 00:00:00,10,"If I knew nothing of Collide before I saw it, which I almost didn't, I'd have to say I'd have come away thinking I must have missed the trailer to a new action blockbuster somehow. I don't know about other reviews, but for me it was as deviously hard-pressed as any Die Hard movie, with a terrific cast giving their all. There were at least four terrific bad guys, including a superbly supercilious Anthony Hopkins and an over-the-top Ben Kingsley being almost as enjoyable as his character in Sexy Beast. The leads were awesome, their acting flawless and their characters a real spark. The story, for me, was clever and original. The dialogue was classic. But the main driver here is the action sequences. If you like cars being flipped like tiddlywinks amid screeches and bangs then Collide is a work of genius. After a wizard romantic start, I found, for me, the last two thirds of this movie to be a terrific edge-of-seat ride, and it was easily an enjoyment and well worth a 10."

Flashbacks by the dozen.
Bad-guy monologues and of course ""save the girl"".

Women telling Men they're wrong, getting angry, chopping down their confidence, storming out etc., and then apologizing later. Writers are following the politically correct ""empowering women"" movement, but overcompensating.

Then it changes and somehow you can start enjoying something.
In my case, I don't like the actor, probably with another actor I would enjoy the movie, so I didn't like so much almost anything, but I have to recognize that the movie is not totally bad.
Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley of course, they do what has to be done, in a professional way as usual.

Guns, fast cars and some decent actors.The story doesn't even matter, it's like any other action movie. Bad guys, a girl and some money/drugs. The action makes this movie great if you ask me.

" Best for car chasing sequence !
",0.6696,0.9898,2019-06-20 00:00:00,8,"It is an action thriller mostly on car chasing. Veteran actor Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley both play here drug mafia's role. A youth, Casey (Nicholas Hoult ) fells love in Juliette ( Felicity Jones) and one day they found that the girl has to replace kidney and want of lot of money, then youth goes to his old boss to ask for money his boss, Geran ( Ben Kingsley) tells him to steal the truck of drug of Hagen Kohl ( Anthony Hopkins). Casey takes challenge with his own plan despite huge risk of high security. Will he get his aim and got the money for his girlfriend, that is the answer is movie. Very interesting story and action packed drama start to finish. Car chasing scenes are heart of the movie. Though whole car action drama looks a little unrealistic, movie is watchable. I wonder that not a single bullet can touch Casey till the end and second unbelievable thing is that if Casey hide the truck then why are goons trying to shoot him, without knowing that where is the truck ? We can leave such thinking behind when watching such fantastic movie. Acting done by Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley is superb. Also Nicholas Hoult gives you fresh experience with perfect helpless but clever youth. Felicity Jones is okay in her role. Cinematography of Car chasing is a good, beautiful and perfect work. Movie is worth for it. If you are action lovers then must watch this title."

Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley are two of my favorites, and I can guarantee it is not because of movies like this one. I had to watch it because of what they use to be. Getting old can be a handicap if you have to work because you need the money, when yesterday you worked because of the demand for your talent. It may not be their entire fault, it may be the directors or there is not creative talent out there who could write a good script. I know now, they are not as great as they were.

",0.0,0.8625,2019-03-05 00:00:00,5,"Pretty bad. I'm surprised Anthony Hopkins agreed to do this movie. They must have paid him a pretty penny. Nick Hoult really needs to learn not to be so self-aware when the camera is focused on him. He tends to smile at the corners of his mouth during those moments, enjoying the attention, and it never works with the scene. He's had this bad habit since, ""About A Boy."" The movie overall is a bunch of dumb luck for the main character combined with mediocre action scenes. The end doesn't make any sense either."
" If 2001 America made a movie about Europe

I did enjoy this movie.
It's definitely no where near as good as it thought it was or wanted to be.
Which was surprising considering the cast.
If this same movie was made with a B list cast people would probably think it was very underated.
But this cast you're used to seeing attached to very high calibre scripts.
This was simply an action flick, without more depth to it than that.
So as that. It's great.
But people are probably perplexed seeing those names be typical action movie characters.
Who knows why people take on projects.
Maybe they get burnt out always being so deep and ascending and just wanted to have fun getting paid to make a movie in Europe.
Who knows, we don't make the big bucks."

Two major thespians from the theatre wheel out for this, Welshman Anthony H and Anglo Indian Ben K, and they overact in the most cliche way... is this a prostrate thing with old male actors? Then the two young Americans are from the bargain basement, a goofy tooth chick who looks like a strung out crack head. And then there's the action male lead (I refuse to say his name) looking 10 years her junior on account of the intern who did her make up. He is an action hero who can't fight his way out of a paper bag, and keeps raising his hands like a scared kid when anyone shoots at him (c'mon Jason Bourne we need your strong but sensitive aura here). He does do one thing though, and that is to look and act pussy whipped. Playa he ain't! Don't be fooled by any talk of action in this fat flabby turkey. IF anyone says so, it's because it's probably the first film they've seen since they went into their Old Peoples Home 20 years ago, or the're from Cologne and you know what we say about Cologne.

Ben Kingsley is over-compensating with crazy character work which clashes with a rather bland performance from Nicholas Hoult. The plan does not work but I've seen worst.

It's cringe-worthy.Hopkins character isn't much better.Some of the action scenes have some decent CGI and some passable real-action as well, that makes them look pretty good, but that might be the nicest thing I can say about this film. The lead(nic hault) is utterly forgettable, as is the story. The film attempts to throw in some humor, one can only imagine to lighten the mood, and that mood is ""this movie stinks"".

All of the negative reviews seem to be from those who are enthralled by names, not substance, and missed the point of the reality for these characters. Woo hoo, ""autobahn, Hopkins, Kingsley,"" but stopped at the name, and did not see the depth and the substance. Listen, don't watch, or at least don't review movies if characters who risk everything don't move you! Seriously, you feckless putz, what have you ever risked for anything?!? Yeah, right, I thought so!!!"
" High Octane chases but lacking plot and script
",0.0,0.9839,2017-06-28 00:00:00,6,"Collide is a cheesy action film that feels like it would have worked in the 1980s/1990s era for the genre. Do not get me wrong, Collide was a decent action film with tons of car chases and action. May not be inventive or big exciting action but just decent enough to enjoy it for what it is. It also has a dumb plot that does not bring anything fresh to the table. The acting is mediocre with the two leads and horrible with the two antagonists played by Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley. And least, the script has some cheesy horrible dialogue that does not seem believable that characters would say that in real situations.The plot follows Casey (Nicholas Hoult) who lives in Germany for a fresh start after his troubles with America. He and his buddy work for a drug dealer Geran (Ben Kingsley) where they are money runners. Casey decides to cut quits when he falls for a bartender Juliette (Felicity Jones). They both share a romantic stare, were they both will risk everything for each other. When Casey finds out that Juliette is struggling with a health condition and would need money to give her that treatment. He takes Gerans money running offer in sabotaging and stealing one of the drug dealers competition Hagen (Anthony Hopkins). When things do not go as planned and Casey is on the run with Hagen's men after him for stealing their money. Casey will do whatever it takes to save the one he loves.The plot is pure dumb fun. Sure, it would make a forgettable film. The sub plot with the love story at times felt very cheesy. The direction of seeing Casey and Juliette having plenty of passionate stares and glances in film does feel out of place for this type of film. But it does relate with the theme that anyone would do anything for love. Even, if it requires stealing several cars, being in high speed chases and crashing several cars. Overall, it was fast paced and once the chases and action starts it never slows down from there.Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones were both decent, delivering okay performances. Anthong Hopkins performance felt stale. He is a great actor and I enjoy almost about any movie he is in. his talent is completely wasted in this film. Ben Kingsley performance also felt out of place as a pimp cocaine loving dealer. Kingsley performance felt like he was playing the same character from Iron Man 3. Felt like he transitioned from that film to this.The script has some cheesy tacking dialogue. It is eye rolling dialogue, especially with the love sub plot on Casey and Juliette. The action and car chases were entertaining and plenty throughout. It is not as exciting and thrilling it is suppose to be. At times, the direction is dull which it would make this film completely forgettable once it ends.Overall, Collide is a fair action film that's only worth checking out as a rental and if you need some cheap action thrills with mediocre acting, terrible dialogue and a dumb plot."

Indeed, it has a nice cast and characters with the basic storyline, but that did not expand and explored well as it should have been. At least the pace of the narration looked fine. Some characters looked unnecessary, and so a couple of scenes. If these all were managed, then still it could have been a decent film. Because since it is an action- adventure, they did not generate those crucial parts like the stunts and dialogues related to the gangster thing to turn it a better film in its kind.The two veteran actors coming together for the first time added more curiosity than flavour we are looking for. They did okay and so the rest of the cast. Ideal runtime, a few stuffs were in the favour of the film, but those were not enough for the overall success. If the same film was made from the non-English world like perhaps Germany, which was one of the producers of the film would have done better than this existing one which is very familiar with this language.People would watch it only for Hopkins and Kingley and so did am I. But they might end in disappointment, or that could be the reason to rate it fairly better. Whatever, this is an okay film, which is barely entertaining and of all, not a boring film. So trying it for one is okay, but I think not worth if you have got plenty of options over this one.6/10"

So he gets back to his old criminal life, getting stuck between feuding gangsters (Anthony Hopkins, Ben Kingsley).""Collide"" is functional, fast-paced and sometimes fun, if ultimately uninvolving actioneer. I have mostly positive things to say about it although the result is not good enough to earn a recommendation.There will be a lot of shooting, punching and fast cars to satisfy the genre fan who just wants to see something new. The movie also has legendary actors Kingsley and Hopkins together on screen for the first time. And the young stars will not disappoint.But the screenplay is so sloppy that it's hard to stay invested. Firstly I didn't quite buy the main story arc of young petty thief outmaneuvering two veteran criminals with small armies, especially because it was done the cheapest way possible (sudden twists whenever convenient for storytellers). I also didn't buy the young hero as a guy never making mistakes or even getting hit hard, although he was constantly hunted by men who work as killers, and have a lot of shooting experience.Also, the story sits uncomfortably between two chairs, being neither serious enough nor tongue-in-cheek enough. You can't take it as a top-shelf actioneer, and it's not quite a flamboyant eurotrash either (many of the Jason Statham movies).As result, some of the stuff works (the beginning, action scenes), some not. Story becomes progressively more stupid, and Hopkins and Kingsley playing ""colorful"" gangsters is like a ham-fisted parody of their roles in earlier, better movies.At least young stars are doing good work. Jones is cute enough to justify all this punching and shooting, and it's always good to see Hoult (""About a Boy"", the newest ""Mad Max"", Hank / Beast in ""X-Men"") in a role which doesn't serve as just a window dressing.If he got a movie role as big and colorful as in the first season of TV series ""Skins"", he could be the next Hollywood hero.

",0.715,0.9952,2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"'COLLIDE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An action flick about a retired American drug dealer, in Germany, who goes back to work for his former boss in order to make enough money to get his dying girlfriend a new kidney. The movie stars Nicholas Hoult, Felicity Jones (of 'STAR WARS' fame), Anthony Hopkins, Ben Kingsley and Marwan Kenzari. It was directed by Eran Creevy (who also helmed 2013's outstanding 'WELCOME TO THE PUNCH'), scripted by Creevy and F. Scott Frazier (who also wrote this year's 'XXX: RETURN OF XANDER CAGE'), and it was co-produced by action master Joel Silver. The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's bombing at the Box Office, but I found it to be somewhat entertaining. Casey Stein (Hoult) is an American who lives in Cologne, Germany, and works for a drug dealer by the name of Geran (Kingsley). He meets another American, named Juliette Marne (Jones), bartending at one of the clubs Geran hangs out at. The two take an immediate liking to each other, but Juliette tells him she could never date anyone that works for Geran. So Casey quits his job, and the two fall in love, but due to Juliette's heavy drinking, her kidney fails one night. She's unqualified for a transplant, because she's an American citizen, so Casey suggests they move back to America and get her a new kidney there. He decides to do one more big job for Geran, against Juliette's wishes, in order to make enough money to pay for this plan. The movie has the feel of a cool 90s type action flick, but it never quite reaches that desired status. It's entertaining, and beautiful to watch at times though. The filmmakers couldn't have possibly gotten a better cast for this film too; Hopkins and Kingsley are so much fun to watch, and Hoult and Jones are both too good for this movie as well. It's the kind of film that definitely looks like it should be a lot better than it is, but it's still kind of fun though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/203409666"

The entire second act is a seemingly endless car chase, when one car is demolished, another is stolen, and the chase resumes (with the money now being carried by Hoult in a conveniently located tin)Anthony Hopkins is wearing a really silly looking, double-breasted, sky blue suit throughout, which made me cringe at the sight of it, and wonder if this is supposed to be a comedy.The second act car chase might be worth a look, if you're into such things, but this really is a braindead, mind-numbing affair."

" Average Thriller with a Strong Cast
",0.5719,0.9879,2017-03-02 00:00:00,5,"When it was released in Germany back in 2014, co-writer & director Eran Creevy's uninspired but bullet-riddled crime thriller ""Collide"" went by the title ""Autobahn"" since segments of this saga careened around on those high-speed highways. Indeed, the most exciting scenes in ""Collide"" take place on the highway, whenx our resilient but reckless hero smashes and crashes several cars. ""xX: Return of Zander Cage"" scenarist F. Scott Frazier collaborated on the script with Creevy, best known for an earlier thriller ""Welcome to the Punch"" (2013), starring James McAvoy, Mark Strong, and David Morrissey. Frazier and Creevy have assembled all the usual clichés in a story reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's script for Tony Scott's classic 1993 movie ""True Romance,"" with Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. ""Collide"" interweaves a love story with vehicular mayhem. Collision qualifies as a recurring theme. Two twenty-something Americans living abroad run into each other during a rave and become romantically inseparable. She refuses to have anything to do with him unless he stops selling narcotics for a psychotic Turkish drug dealer. Eventually, he discovers that she needs a kidney transplant. Meantime, our troubled hero agrees to collaberate in a multi-million-dollar narcotics hijacking to pay for her transplant with his cut of the loot. Our hero is far from prepared for the consequences when things go sideways. British actor Nicholas Hoult and British actress Felicity Jones are adequately cast as two woebegone Americans who lock horns with an affluent German millionaire and his zealous army of predatory gunmen. The millionaire wants them because our hero stole a truckload of cocaine from him. Scores of pistol-packing Germans scramble after him both in careening automobiles and on foot. Mind you, the adrenaline-laced, pedal-to-the-metal chase scenes are gripping, but the hero and heroine qualify as strictly sketchy characters, with little to distinguish them apart from their chemistry for each other. Oscar-winning actors Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley garner considerably less screen time as rival villains, but they deliver scene-stealing performances that should distract you from Hoult and Jones. ""Collide"" literally amounts to a collision not only between the hero and heroine, but everybody else involved in this derivative, run-of-the-mill, PG-13 rated melodrama that inserts a surprise or two during its sinewy, 99-minute running time.Casey Stein (Nicholas Hoult of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"") has fled from America because he has stolen one too many vehicles. Now, he works as a henchman for Geran (Ben Kingsley of ""Iron Man 3"") who operates a racetrack as well as a bordello. Meantime, when Casey isn't running Geran's errands, he samples the night life in Cologne, Germany. One evening he encounters an attractive barkeep, Juliette Marne (Felicity Jones of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story""), and they discuss the metaphysics of fate governing their lives. Predictably, the two hit it off and shack up together, but not before Casey renounces all ties to Geran at Juliette's insistence. They experience a momentary setback when Casey discovers that Juliette hasn't been entirely honest about herself. She winds up at the local hospital, must undergo dialysis, and learns that she needs a $200-thousand-dollar kidney transplant. Afterward, we see our sympathetic heroine attached to a dialysis machine, as this far-fetched, B-movie, action drama veers into reality. Frustrated with his grueling, junk yard job and unable to pay for Juliette's transplant, Casey goes back to Geran. Geran, Casey, and Geran's other henchman Matthias (Marwan Kenzari of the recent ""Ben-Hur"" remake) concoct an outrageous plan to steal a tractor-trailer load of drugs that belong to a legitimate but larcenous businessman, Hagen Kahl (Anthony Hopkins of ""Silence of the Lambs""), who traffics in thousands of golf balls filled with cocaine. Naturally, Juliette knows nothing about Casey's recidivism. Once he has decided to go back into business with Geran, Casey refuses to back out, but he discovers that Kahl and his henchman play for keeps. Such is Casey's love for Juliette that he refuses to give up despite the overwhelming odds against him. Meantime, Kahl and Geran have worked together in the past, but the ambitious Geran wants to be a partner more than just an accomplice. He wants more than Kahl is willing to concede, and Kahl's reluctance prompts Geran to rob him, with Casey and Matthias performing the heavy lifting.""Collide"" doesn't look like a big screen movie despite its abundance of talent and action. Legendary action producer Joel Silver, who produced cinematic blockbusters for Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Mel Gibson back in the halcyon 1990s, provided the financing for the careening, runaway auto chases that degenerate into dizzy demolition derbies. Nevertheless, despite its muscular $21 million budget, ""Collide"" resembles an average, low-octane, straight-to-video thriller release. Fortunately, Frazier and Creevy keep our hero Casey jumping through one metaphorical flaming hoop after another without let-up so he is sufficiently challenged throughout. Sadly, whatever momentum the film occasionally generates is undercut by the entirely predictable nature of the action. Not long after the villains capture Casey, they learn about his relationship with Juliette, and she turns into a traditional damsel-in-distress who cannot defend herself. According to his voice-over narration, Casey insists that his deep love for Juliette justifies one crime after another that he resorts to for her benefit. As a shrewd strategy to grab audiences, Creevy and Frazier kick-start ""Collide"" with a bracing car chase and crash on the autobahn and then plunge viewers into a flashback that continues until everything comes full circle. As well-intentioned as Casey Stein is as a hero, he isn't an admirable character, and he cannot drive worth a diddly squat. Not surprisingly, our hero and heroine live happily ever after, and the bad guys get their comeuppance, but little about ""Collide"" is memorable. As a double-dyed villain, Anthony Hopkins enlivens every scene, and Ben Kingsley is just as entertaining as his antagonist. You won't miss anything if you wait for this routine thriller to show up as a streaming Netflix rental."

" Not Good But the Action is Solid
",0.0508,0.9647,2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"For all its various faults, Collide should be considered a tiny miracle. The story is not very good, the acting ranges from passable to laughable and its tendency to tease pretension feels beyond silly. But the action does at times feels like an amalgam of decent inspiration and cool lo-fi ideas. Think second-rate Transporter (2002) tropes mixed with the quick-paced plodding of something like Cellular (2004) only with all the humor slowly bled out of it.Nicholas Hoult plays reformed car thief and incurable American Casey Stein who gives it all up for the love of a girl played by Felicity Jones. They live only for each other, sharing the honeymoon stage of their new relationships with uncommon (and unreal) naivety. Thus when Juliette (Jones) admits she's suffering from kidney failure, it comes at a bit of a shock to both Casey and audiences still prone to caring. Casey then decides to pull off one more heist for the sake of operation money because, you know, that's how movies like these go.It's also important to mention this film takes place entirely within Germany specifically in and around Cologne where quaint cobblestone streets and new concrete pylons uneasily collide. The setting goes a long way in giving the action and suspense enough of a unique flavor. We've got foot chases bursting through tight rows of provincial town homes, close escapes among crowded subways stations and clumsy car chases through famously swift autobahn traffic. If Collide were nothing more than a highlight reel of Nicholas Hoult attempting to be an action star, you could certainly do worse.Unfortunately, Collide takes far too long to set up its rehearsed batch of completely competent action set pieces. And once it does start sputtering towards the finish line, we're constantly reminded of all the vacuous bits the movie insists are important. So much time is taken to setup Casey and Juliette's storybook romance but it's done using the laziest of clichés. It's a litany of prosaic, self-serious and boring treacle that looks and sounds like it's even painful for the actors involved. The camera even captures their airless, personality-less scenes with the same polished artificiality of a magazine photo shoot.Being provided such as lackluster script, at least Hoult and Jones do seem game for the challenge. Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley on the other hand seem to be one-upping each other to see who can do the worst impression of a crime kingpin since Gary Cole in Pineapple Express (2008). Both actors don't so much talk as they erupt in fits of word salad, the only difference of which is one keeps referencing Shakespeare while the other references Smokey and the Bandit (1977). The two veteran actors share the screen only once and in this particular moment of climax, it felt as if they were almost winking at each other.Yet even at it's most foppish, Collide still manages to keep its gears churning like a tightly wound clock. Everything that can possibly kill this passable action flick stops just short of being lethal and that does include Anthony Hopkins power blue suit. Much like the similarly themed Abduction (2011), Collide is nothing more than a veiled excuse to throw a pretty looking face into a boilerplate action movie to see if his charisma can carry the day. In both cases the results are unfortunate but at least in Hoult's case it's not downright tragic."

It had a budget of $29 million but looks and feels like a low budget movie- Maybe Ben & Anthony got big salaries? This is also the first time that Ben and Anthony have worked in a movie together, and both happen to play bad guys. Nicholas plays an American in Europe that works for an eccentric gangster, Ben. One night in a club, Nicholas meets and falls hard for another American, Felicity. She has a problem with him working for Ben-she doesn't want him to get hurt or maybe get into trouble-so he decides to quit and get a normal job. Ben goes to his boss, Anthony, and wants to become an equal partner with him but Anthony refuses, saying that Ben is not as sophisticated as himself. About this time, Felicity gets sick-she needs a kidney or it's night night for her-and Nicholas decides to pull off a heist of Anthony's next drug run just to pay for her operation. Most of the movie is filled with high speed car chases- some on the Autobahn-and fantastic coincidences and unbelievable bits of luck in Nicholas' favor, especially when he escapes Anthony's henchmen in their pursuit of him. The action is fine but they could have used better writers. I guess you could call it 'Fast & Sloppy'; Fast action and Sloppy writing. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action, language, drug material and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental."

I mean, there is nothing like watching Kingsley and Hopkins in the same room even in this nonsense.The action though is is really good. Once the cheesy plot is reveled it's a high speed chase down a German highway for most of the movie that kicks some major butt. From average cars to really high performance vehicles, running wild on some roads in Germany, and causing some cool crashes. Plus some really cool in-between action sequences. I'm thinking this was what the movie was all about.So yeah, the movie does the trick. Good actors and a cool car chase makes for a really nice action flick that's not boring.http://cinemagardens.com"
" a passable heist movie
",0.0,0.9938,2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"As a actor i find Nicholas Hoult is very good as the socially awkward role in the past but for a leading man of a action movie.....Not that much.In this movie Nicholas Hoult played as a guy named Casey a con- man that willing leave his job for a girl he just meet in a club played by Felicity Jones for the first 10 minutes into the movie(talk about good romance elements).Soon or later they started living with each other have a carefree life full of melodramatic scene until he find out that she has a fatal disease and needs a kidney transplant that cost 200000 grand he decided it time to get back in the game to make some serious money.This time he has to pull out a impossible truck heist full of cocaine from a mob boss played by Anthony Hopkins with the help of another white cracking mob boss played by Ben Kingsley so we has our movie.Beside the genetic script full of plot holes that later been fixed in a unconvincing way at the end,the majority of people who can't act and always make dumb move and bad decisions.The only thing that keep me interest is how nicely shot this movie is,the action scene is well handle with some good car chase scene and one on foot chase that not being shot with shaky cam,some few tense moment and laughably awesome acting by Ben Kingsley that help this movie not turned into a completely disaster.Trust me this is not the worst Nicholas Hoult movie and fan of him can watch it just for his face"
" What were Hopkins and Kingsley thinking?
",0.0,-0.9575,2017-02-06 00:00:00,3,"When I saw Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingley's names attached to this movie I thought how bad could it be? Well, it's bad. Really bad. Dumb as a brick. Great chase sequences on the autobahns but a story that is as lame as they come. Girl needs kidney operation so boyfriend hijacks truck full of drugs and gangsters come after him. Endless escapes that happen SOOOO conveniently to keep the story going. Couldn't the producers have sprung for an extra couple of writers to punch up the story and make it less predictable? Were Hopkins and Kingsley so desperate for a paycheck that they were willing to stoop to acting in this trash? Your heart bleeds for them. When I saw the movie cost twenty one million to make I was astounded as I figured well below ten. The distribution company that picked up this movie when the first distributor went bankrupt should pray to God that they don't join the first company in the bankruptcy courts. Don't hold your breath for any solid figures at the box office. And who are the fools likening this to the Fast and the Furious franchise? Not even close!"
" Not as bad as the comments says
",0.431,0.9625,2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"Apart from all the bad reviews and comments; its not as bad as it seems. Collide is quite an enjoyable movie if you love action movies and the genre, it delivers all the elements action lovers wish for like super car chases, guns fights, mob bosses and stuff. In my opinion its quite a decent action flick even though the story doesn't deliver anything fresh, still i quite enjoyed and liked the twist ending. Good performances by two Oscar winners Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley, also including one Oscar nominee Felicity Jones and Nicholas Hoult. If you don't expect sophisticated twists, action and story telling this is highly recommended."
" Fast !! Fast !! Fast !!
",0.0,-0.2476,2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"Anthoy Hopkins - Nicholas Hoult - Ben Kingsley - Felicity Jones An edge of the seat thriller which wont make you to think about the logic and story because of the fast narration. Excellent car chases, action (no fist fights) and camera-work and also I wont forget to mention the background Score. Casey has to do one more job to save the life of his girlfriend but gone wrong and the villains are in pursuit of Casey.Nicholas Hoult was okay with the role but i think he has to come up more with his abilities. Anthony Hopkins once again strike the chord even at his age. Ben Kingsley did well. But Felicity Jones has got nothing to do much.My rating : 7.1"
" Almost excellent all over......
",0.5279,0.9928,2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"well, the missing 1 is taken by Anthony Hopkins, worst performance i ever saw, and at 64 i saw my share of movies.... boring, predicted, disgustingly dressed, why was he in this movie? Best performance though, goes to Ben Kingsley, I never liked the man, but in this film he is so great!!! the man found his niche, he is unbelievable!!!! The story is, as expected, ridiculous, but who cares? the action is amazing, the crooks look like real crooks, not the typical idiots, real mean and determined, the cars, oh, the cars.... Felicity is beautiful, and Nicholas Hoult, hmmm.... he's OK. All in all, a great action film, not up to the Fast and the Furious films, but stands excellently on it's own as a good afternoon time spend."
" A product placement for various car companies
",0.0,0.0865,2017-01-20 00:00:00,2,"Two dimensional characters, hackneyed plot and plot devices, very unrealistic pretty much everything including the behaviour of the main villain - Anthony Hopkins must be ashamed for having a central role in this movie.I can hardly find anyone who could enjoy this movie. It's not for adults, that's for sure, because its love story is just too simple and repulsing, however the young might enjoy it for its reckless car chases and kisses, fist fights and chivalry.I pity everyone who starred in this movie. It could have been a very average straight to DVD B-movie but given the range of actors it's simply unwatchable.This could be a perfect product placement movie on a par with the Fast and Furious franchise. This movie and this franchise share a lot of common. Missing realism is their common staple.The final twist couldn't save this movie. It just made it even more sickly-sweet."
" one of the best action movies of 2016
",0.6369,0.9888,2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"nick hoult and felicity jones...2 young stars with solid movies under their belt already...hoult has much better acting chops. anthony hopkins and ben kingsley, 2 of the best thespians of our times. who knew you could cast them in an all out action movie and it would work? not an Oscar winner but it works very well as an action movie. top flight action choreography with an intense focus on high end sports cars chasing and being chased. the gunfights and car stunts are as good as any you will find in the year 2016. predictable story but very well done...kingsley and hopkins could sleepwalk thru their scenes and they would still do well. hoult hasn't made a bad movie yet...all his movies have been entertaining and hes' actually been in a lot of movies as hes started quite young in movies. all in all...OK acting and great action sequences...the time just flew buy...add an extra star for fans of good action movies."

" It wasn't groundbreaking, but damn I enjoyed watching this action flick.
",0.8093,0.8578,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"What I do know about you is that you're American, because my friends here tell me you were talking while you were unconscious which or course is typically American isn't it? And judging by your stubborn refusal to talk right now while you are fully conscious, I guess that must make you an extremely, brave American or excessively stupid American. I don't know, you tell me! Yeh. But you and I can surely cut through all that boring back and fourth Sylvester Stallone nonsense  ""Eh ah Adreine"".I was ready for a typical action B-movie with a lot of ill-timed fighting scenes, corny dialogues, outworn one-liners used by muscled men and over the top firefights using tons of ammunition. And all this to fill up a thin, highly unoriginal story. Actually, I thought this would be just a simple movie to spend my evening. And I figured it wouldn't matter if I'd doze off or not. Well, sometimes I can be wrong about something. ""Collide"" is an example of that. And when well-known film stars appear on the screen one after the other, the surprise effect is even bigger.Granted, the reason why Casey (Nicholas ""Equals"" Hoult) finally decided to steal a truck, owned by the dangerous and ruthless drug smuggler Hagen Kahl (Anthony Hopkins), commissioned by a nut called Geran (Ben Kingsley), is rather trite. You can't say it isn't used already in another film. The subsequent action-packed portion, with Casey continuously trying to stay out of the hands of Kahl's guard who eagerly want to get back the stolen truck, is of such caliber that you put yourself upright so you won't miss a second. What you're going to see is a series of tough fights, enormous gunfights, dazzling chases in the streets of a picturesque German town and some high-speed car chases on the ""German Autobahn"" around Cologne. Casey drives with (in my eyes) some expensive sports cars. Fans of ""The Fast and the Furious"" will be excited about that, I think. I myself am not an expert in that field. I'm already feeling ecstatic the moment I see the speedometer reaching 260 kph.I was quite impressed by Nicholas Hoult. A cool-headed person with bright blue eyes (undoubtedly successful among females). He looks like Ed ""The Transporter"" Skrein (as if they are twin brothers) and he shows similarities with the young Bruce Willis in his heyday (not the last 10 years). He's also so impassive and cold-blooded. And he's also suffering from physically damages as the film progresses. Although Juliette (Felicity ""The Theory of Everything"" Jones) is the one who caused all the misery, you can call her part actually quite limited. And maybe people wonder what star actors like Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley are doing in such a simplistic movie. I suggest you watch the movie ""Blackway"" with Hopkins in a leading role. And also ""Robot Overlords"" with Kingsley participating in it. These aren't exactly high quality films or masterpieces either. Both are typical stories with no memorable footage (in other words, they suck). At least ""Collide"" is peppered with unparalleled action and sometimes masterful monologues. The discussions between the two men are a feast for the eyes and ears.I haven't enjoyed myself with such a nonsensical action movie for a long time. Ultimately it's all about how love can encourage someone to make inconsiderate decisions and carry out dangerous acts like Casey did. ""If the reason is love, then maybe it's not so crazy, and it's the only thing keeping me alive"" said Casey at the beginning of the movie. Oh well, maybe it all looks senseless and feels like nonsense. Maybe some characters lack depth and some German supporting roles are pitifully poor. And yes, the German police acted rather stupid and exaggerated during their final intervention. That was indeed rather ridiculous. It was as if Osama bin Laden himself was sitting in that dingy pub. Yet it was entertaining and interesting enough. It's not groundbreaking cinema, but good enough to watch when you have nothing else to do.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" No Hollywood Blockbuster though well worth a watch
",0.6908,0.9118,2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,Do not be influenced by the negative reviews that other people have stated about this movie. I created a IMDb login just to write my opinion.The supporting cast of Hopkins and Kingsley is a bonus. They portray the villain characters superbly. This is a decent action film that has a frenetic pace and keeps you engrossed throughout. The plot wraps up nicely towards the end with a satisfying conclusion.While this isn't a groundbreaking film it is certainly worth a viewing and will keep you entertained from start to finish.
" Great Action Movie
",0.6249,0.9153,2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"If your primary expectation in an action movie is to get entertained then this one is highly recommended. Collide is an enjoyable action flick with solid performances by all main actors, including Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley. The film was shot in nice locations in Germany, features great cars and suspenseful car chases. For the plot, yes there were some mistakes, but not at a disturbing level. I also liked the twist in the end.Considering the movie's low ratings and some of the crushing reviews the overall quality delivered was a real surprise to me. I considered it much more entertaining then all of the recent mutant/superhero crap made in Hollywood."
" Terrible, Just Terrible
",-0.7351,-0.9631,2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"Man oh man, what a bad movie. Lead actor was so bad and just not likable. He was so unlikable in fact, as I watched this, I was actually rooting for the bad guys. I wanted the bad guys to take this dude out so this movie could end and I could at least walk away from watching this with some kind of smile on my face. He played the part so wuss like, it made me cringe. Bad story, bad script, bad acting. Hopkins and Kingsley, what can I say. I love both these dudes but couldn't figure out what either one of them was thinking when they decided to be in this movie. It was a mercy killing for both of them. The story was so bad, all this movie did for me was give me a big crick in my neck from shaking my head so much. With both Hopkins and Kingsley in this I was hoping I would be seeing a decent movie. Nope, not happening, even their caliber of acting could not save this POS movie. Always hard for me to watch good actors in bad movies."
" One of the few movies I wish I never wasted time on
",0.6517,-0.8675,2017-01-05 00:00:00,2,"What a waste of my time. Poor acting really by the main lead character just killed the film for me. Slower pace than I expected at the first third of the film .Just because its an ""indie"" film does not make it good. Hopkins and Kinglsey were cameo roles going the way of Nicolas Cage and other ""has been"" actors just for another film in their resume. There's a lot of films competing for my time and money, unfortunately this one was a let down. Surprisedat how much this cost to make, but I guess the big guys needed their cut and the action scenes cost more in Europe to film. I guess this film wasn't for me."
" One of the best indie films
",0.6369,0.9524,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Decent story great action scenes what else do you want from a indie movie? Well it turns out that collide is miles better than you think.The story of a skint backpacker (Nicholas Hoult) who falls in love with a girl who turns out to be sick, so he needs money to pay for surgery. In steps Geran (Ben Kingsley) a drug seller to offer him a job with big pay......To steal from his drug associate and kingpin boss Hagen Kahl (Anthony Hopkins)Of course it goes wrong but the way it plays out is brilliant with epic performances from both Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins and a stellar performance from Nicholas Hoult collide is one of the best indie films to be released. From great car chase scenes on the famous Autobahn to the reveal of the crime, this is 90minutes of cinema master class"
