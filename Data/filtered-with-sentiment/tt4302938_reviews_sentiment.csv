" The ending sucks
",-0.3612,0.6908,2021-04-06 00:00:00,6,"The movie was good until the ending and close to the ending,I liked the characters,the action scenes and the story until the end."
" For people that dont understand the ending
",0.0,0.8429,2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,"I love all of it and it's a masterpiece so I'm skipping the review and getting to the ending. For some reason people cant understand the ending. It deals with dimensia. The grandson, Kubo, is telling a story. While not true still tells a fantastic story, his grandfather cannot remember anything anymore. Dimensia. So the townsfolk remind him he is a kind man that helped everyone in the community. It's about remembering your past even though Kubo lost his because both his mother and father died while being raised by his memory stricken grandfather. It's about honoring your past. Just told through the eyes of an imaginative grandson."
" Insipid
",-0.4588,-0.9765,2021-03-18 00:00:00,5,"I've been catching up on Western animated movies recently and while they're all formulaic, I can accept that and salvage a few good moments. Maybe it's because I've finally had enough of them, but this time I am not overlooking the quality of the writing. Uninspired is one thing, but this is more than that. It follows the hero's journey without knowing how the hero's journey actually works.First, the uninspired part, which applies to the surface level creativeness. As other reviews have noted, the setting is Japanese but the tone and music are American. The music uses some eastern string instruments but the style is still generically western. Even beyond the lack of Japanese flavor, the jokes and interactions during the hero's journey part don't land.Apart from style the movie isn't creative with respect to substance, either, but that's fine. The hero's journey works because it is centered around the completion of the hero's arc. In order to have an arc in the first place, the hero must have a weakness that needs to be solved. This internal conflict is frequently used to parallel the overall theme. Kubo has no strongly established internal weakness, so there's no arc for him, which means there's no real hero's journey. Sure, the fight scenes and obstacles are there, but without the hero's growth it's all just there to fill screentime. Towards the end they propagate the theme of choosing an earthly existence filled with emotion and dealing with death by remembering the dead, as opposed to a cold celestial one. Except that Kubo never has much trouble dealing with death in the first place. His other facets of growth, like becoming more powerful and learning new skills, feel slapped on so they can check it off on the hero's journey list."
" If you thought Coraline was beautiful, wait until you see this...
",0.5994,0.9947,2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"The wonder I had at the level of detail and imagination which Laika Stuidos have packed into this movie truly rivals the wonder I had when Pixar produced the first Toy Story. It is lush and colourful and every frame is a delight. So much so that it's hard to believe it's stop-motion. Surely there was some hybrid model used here? Right?Anyway, the lead character, Kubo, voiced by Art Parkinson is a traditional fairy tale hero; good and kind, but poor, and destined to be another chosen one. Kubo is blessed with magical origami skills - when he plays his guitar-like instrument, he can make the paper dance and bend into figures and shapes.
Of course, this power is a sign of his magical heritage, and that heritage is not all good. His evil aunts and grandfather are on the hunt for him, and he is soon forced into a quest seeking magical weapons that can aid him against them.The film, set in medieval Japan, makes an half-hearted attempt to explore this (to my Western eyes) foreign culture, but it's a meagre attempt at best, though it is great to see non-white characters peopling such a film (even if the voice cast doesn't follow through on that promise).The charm of this quest is the beauty of the landscape, the humour (mainly provided by Matthew McConaughey in goofy mode), and the joy of discovery - both of the details of Kubo's family history, and of his delight in what he can do.The story does begin to lag somewhat around the two thirds mark, and the climax, while getting top marks for being different, does feel a little anti-climactic. As things slow, you begin to wish the Ralph Fiennes voiced Moon King would reappear, or better yet, the Rooney Mara voiced Aunts of Kubo, who are the scariest parts of the film.Director Travis Knight, and his two screenwriters, Marc Haimes, and Chris Butler, (Based on a story by Haimes and Shannon Tindle) may not have hit a home run here, but they have done wonderful work, and ensured Pixar and Illumination know they have serious competition."
" Had it's moments but disappointing overall
",-0.6486,0.5719,2021-02-03 00:00:00,5,"Charming, beautiful animation but the story telling wasn't great... it was ok in the beginning but got boring throughout and I had to push myself to finish it."
" This is my favourite work of the studio's so far
",0.0,0.9869,2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Great, creative story.'Kubo and the Two Strings' is a fun film, I enjoyed it all. I love the animation style that Laika use, they also tend to get the vibe of their stories pretty bang on. This is my favourite work of the studio's so far, at least before I watch 'Missing Link'.The casting could've been more appropriate, though I'm a believer of anyone playing anyone when it comes to voice roles. Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey make for an undeniably strong trio. Parkinson and Theron do particularly good jobs, though McConaughey is my standout. Elsewhere, Ralph Fiennes and George Takei are, minorly, involved.The lovely story and top animation are the biggest takeaways from this. Recommended."
" Impressive and moving
",0.5106,0.5156,2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie just yesterday and I will say, I am impressed. it was very deeply moving, and the very sad story (it's not a Hollywood style happy ending movie) is told in a very delicate, never harsh way. There is both sadness and happiness in this movie, sometimes mixed together.Having watched it with a child, I will say. Some children will be turned off by the sad story: for this, it is maybe best to watch with 10 years old or so. In any case it is a movie even adults should watch.From the technical point of view, it is almost incredible to think this movie was made mostly with stop motion (aided by computer, of course, but still). Some scenes are breath taking.On a cultural note, for all it's Japanese cultural references and ""color"" this is a movie which could not but be western in the way it expresses the story and the feelings in it. In a way it is a beautiful mix. In a way I could understand some people in Japan maybe not appreciating it too much."

" Stupid and underwhelming
",-0.5267,-0.3513,2020-12-01 00:00:00,3,"I've never been the hugest fan of these sorta films. Paranorm was great, Boxtrolls was eh, and Coraline was a hellish nightmare, but nothing quite takes the garbage-filles cake like Kubo. I was actually looking forward to this a whole lot, but it sucked. The story was so predictable and boring and there are no twists. It was actually borderline cringe-stupid The only reason why i rate it a 3 and not lower is cos the animation is sorta cool."

" Parents Can be Monkeys and Insects Sometimes
",0.0,0.8098,2020-10-08 00:00:00,8,"We watched this in Princeton after seeing ""Missing Link"" and getting into the Laika style of animation. We think it's the studio's best film: the most impressive stop-motion animation I've ever seen, great characters, and an epic plot. The atmosphere can be a bit foreboding for children, and the intra-family strife upsetting, but the main character, Kubo, gets constant support from his parents on his journey, even it's not in the way he expects."

" Bad joke of mine
",-0.3182,0.4588,2020-07-29 00:00:00,7,"The whole movie is a videoclip for Regina Spektor's cover of the Beatle's ""While my guitar gently weeps""."
" Watch it for the animation
",0.0,0.9794,2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Yes, the premise could have been handled better and this is far from Laika's best movie nor is it one of the best movies of the decade. However, the animation is alone the best reason to watch the movie. It is absolutely gorgeous. Also, some of the characters are interesting, particularly Beetle who is voiced by Matthew Mconaughy. On the other hand, the main villain, the Moon King, is under-developed, the premise is not as well-done as it could have been, and some of the humor falls flat. Overall, it is worth a watch, though recommending the film depends on your judgement."
" Possibly Laika's best film
",0.6369,0.9617,2020-06-04 00:00:00,9,"Either this or Coraline is Laika's best film. Kubo and the Two Strings has amazing animation and every frame would make a good wallpaper. The design of the settings and characters are all stunning. The characters, story and soundtrack all combined make this a very compelling and underrated film. I loved it."
" Kubo and the Two Strings
",0.0,0.9966,2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,"I saw the trailer for this movie in the cinema, it looked really cool, and then it got nominated some big awards later, I missed it on television a few times, but I did eventually watch it when I got the opportunity, from the creators of Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. Basically, in mythical ancient Japan, twelve-year-old Kubo (Art Parkinson) lost his left eye when he was a baby, he wears an eyepatch. He looks after his ill mother Sariatu (Charlize Theron) in a mountain cave near a village, and makes a living with his magical shamisen, a three-stringed ancient instrument. He uses the magic to manipulate origami with music, to entertain the people of the village, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a samurai warrior. Kubo is never able to finish the story, as he does not know what happened to his father and Sariatu cannot recall the ending due to her deteriorating mental state. Sariatu warns him never to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi (Rooney Mara), and his grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes), who took his eye when he was a baby, will find him and take his remaining eye. One day, Kubo learns of the village's Bon festival allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angered that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern. He forgets to return home before sunset, Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack. Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armour. When Kubo wakes, he finds himself in a frozen wasteland, alongside Monkey (Theron), his wooden snow monkey charm, who has been brought to life. Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. Guided by ""Little Hanzo"", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out on their quest to find the armour, which consists of the ""Sword Unbreakable"", the ""Breastplate Impenetrable"", and the ""Helmet Invulnerable"". Along the way, they meet Beetle (Matthew McConaughey), a samurai suffering amnesia, he believes he was once a great warrior and to have been Hanzo's apprentice, cursed to take the form of a stag beetle/human hybrid. Kubo, Monkey, and Beetle are led into Hall of Bones, guarded by a monstrous giant skeleton. They battle the monster to reclaim the Sword Unbreakable, it is defeated when Kubo pulls the sword, among many others, from the skeleton's head. Once out of the cave, Kubo takes the opportunity to prove his worth and creates a massive ship out of leaves so they can cross the Long Lake. The Breastplate Impenetrable is located deep underwater, at the bottom of the lake. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter the ""Garden of Eyes"", a sea monster who uses its many eyes to entrance its victims, showing them visions. Kubo is caught in the underwater creature's sight, which reveals that Monkey is a reincarnation of his mother. Monkey meanwhile battles with the Karasu, she is badly wounded after defeating the witch. The unconscious Kubo is nearly swallowed, until Beetle rescues him and obtains the Breastplate. They go to shore to recover, where Monkey/Sariatu explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo. Instead Sariatu fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. While Kubo sleeps, Sariatu confides to Beetle that she didn't tell Kubo her identity before because the magic keeping her alive is fading. Beetle promises to look after Kubo once she is gone. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who tells him the Helmet Invulnerable is in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realise too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them, and kills Hanzo. Sariatu sacrifices herself, giving Kubo time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo helps to reveal that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string of the instrument to quickly travel there. At the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant dragon-type creature, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers. When Hanzo's armour proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show Raiden that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Raiden is stripped of his powers by the magic of Kubo and the spirits, leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers show compassion and accept a redeemed Raiden into the village. Kubo is able to speak to the ghosts of his parents during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world. Also starring George Takei as Hosato. Theron and McConaughey are the most memorable of the stars providing voices, as the lead hero's brave companions, the film is filled with many likeable characters, it is terrific story of a perilous journey, it is elevated by the themes of love, loneliness and loss, it is colourful, and of course the animation and special effects are exquisite, an amazingly enchanting masterpiece stop-motion animated fantasy adventure. It won the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, it was nominated the Oscars for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!"
" High hopes for this one but a disappointment
",-0.5499,-0.2991,2020-04-15 00:00:00,4,Irritating monkey......precocious child.....bad mix. Familiar story of dealing with loss. Unfunny script. No feeling of peril/danger and hence not caring about what happens to the characters and in any drama that is essential for it to work.It looks good and im sure alot of people put alot of effort into it but there had to be more beneath the surface for me and it wasnt there.

" Average
",0.0,0.5192,2020-02-17 00:00:00,5,Being original doesn't equal being great. Great everything to be honest but a bit boring. This is a fantastic production but it just falls flat because the story is quite predictable and I'm generally terrible at foreseeing story lines. Just about worth a watch but leagues behind Studio Ghibli which isn't reflected in it's score.
" The animation alone is worth seeing

" Just lovely.
",0.5859,0.9758,2020-01-06 00:00:00,9,"""Kubo and the Two Strings"" is a lovely film...and even more amazing because it was made mostly utilizing stop-motion. It's obvious that the folks from Laika Studio really cared and worked hard to make the film this artistic and pleasing to the eyes.The story is about a magical boy who has been kept in hiding for many years. It turns out that the child's grandfather is a cruel supernatural being...and the boy's aunts are intent on capturing the boy. To protect him are a snow monkey, a strange samurai/beetle hybrid and an origami miniature soldier.The story is very strange...with many unusual elements. Relax....and quickly your brain will stop questioning and you can enjoy the strange, otherworldly tale. Incredibly well animated, a delight to the eyes and a nice story all work together to make this a special film...one that adults can enjoy just as much as their kids."

" A gorgeous movie, but it could have been better with it's writing.
",0.7469,0.9883,2019-10-29 00:00:00,6,"The animation is undeniably magnificent and no one will deny it. Laika is probably the best animation studio that makes the most beautiful stop-motion animated movies ever. They put so much love and care, when they are making movies and have so many small details that is unbelievable and i always wonder how they did all of those things. It's hard to find words to describe everything about Laika and their animation, since everyone, who saw all of their movies already said everything that needed to be said about them in full detail.With it's beautiful animation and alongside with the amazing cinematography and great editing makes it the most gorgeous stop-motion animated movie ever made alongside with the jaw-dropping and amazingly written animated movie from Charlie Kaufman ""Anomalisa"", but unfortunately i wish that i could say the same thing about the rest of the aspects like the story, characters, dialogue and half of the music.There was only one moment in the story that i did like and that was in the beginning were Kubo uses magic to manipulate origami with music for the village folk, but that's it. Everything else was OK at least. There wasn't any moment that i was scared if the characters will fail or had any tension in the story. It had some moments that acted like a twist and tried to be very surprising with them, but they ended up very predictable. At first you don't notice them, but when the story continues forward - they start to show up and after that you can tell where the movie will go.The characters weren't all that compelling or interesting.There wasn't any memorable or quotable lines throughout the movie.The soundtrack is very mixed for me. Half of the tracks did repeat throughout the movie or didn't stand out all that much, but the other half of the tracks were great.The acting from the cast wasn't bad, but was weak. If english is not your home language, when watch the movie in dubbed version - just like i did. After watching it with a dub, i tried with the english language and i wasn't all that impressed by the acting.Overall it's a gorgeous movie, but I wish the writers had done a better job with the screenplay, because with all of those problems that i have with the movie - all of the hard work from the animators feels wasted. It wasn't as great as Coraline, but i'll still see it again, if i have the chance."
" Stunning animation and touching story brought down by weak dialogue
",-0.0772,0.9653,2019-10-15 00:00:00,7,"A touching tale of loss, familial bonds, and the power of memory. The animation (in usual LAIKA fashion) is absolutely spectacular, and truly evokes traditional Japanese art. The score is equally well-crafted.I only wish that LAIKA had handled the dialogue with just as much care as the rest of the production. Though the voice acting is superb, a good amount of the dialogue is cringe-worthy. Most of the humor falls flat. That, in addition to the sometimes uneven pacing, detracted from my enjoyment of the movie.I'd still recommend giving it a watch, though, if only for the animation.A note for parents: I'd recommend this for older children, maybe 8+. The antagonist could be somewhat frightening for younger children, and the pacing too deliberate to keep their attention."
" Nice idea but Film missed mark badly!
",-0.7463,0.9709,2019-09-14 00:00:00,4,I love the idea of this film trying to look like a woodblock print and using origami. This could have been such a great movie and it has some very creative and moving moments and messages but I could not stay in the somewhat confusing story with all these characters being often too loud and American sounding and the movie being so very Un-Japanese in tone. Much of the dialogue sounds like over the top American culture and sounds odd distracting coming out of the attempted Japanese looking characters. There are no main characters using Japanese voice actors and the faces and expressions read exagerated and overdone. Yes it is a family / children's movie but children don't need to have things so overdone to get the point of an emotion. What are we telling them about Japanese culture when we make everybody in this movie sound like an American Disney Channel character? Where is the subtle classic understated beautiful powerful Japanese culture in these characters? It would have made more sense if they'd made the same story without it trying to be Japanese. Im sure there were Japanese actors available ready and willing to do these roles and it would have elevated this film so much and removed the distracting nature of hearing American voices. It was even more distracting having this Americanized dialogue and behavior of these characters. What a missed opportunity this was to make this movie in this manner.
" Great animation but ultimately confusing
",0.0516,0.6609,2019-07-29 00:00:00,3,"The animation of this film is well done as the colours and visuals are pleasing to look at. Besides that, the story is rather confusing. We see first that Kubo is in a quest to help his sick mother (whom of which isn't shown). Later he ends up meeting a monkey than along the way a man in a beetle costume. We then later find out that the monkey is actually his mother and the beetle is his father?!This movie has gotten overly praised and recognition (nominated for two Oscars, 97% on Rotten Tomatoes) simply because of the animation but truthfully the story isn't interesting, is boring and at times slow.In short, Kubo isn't an interesting character and we don't exactly know his motivation. The story does get better when the man beetle shows up and we see the conflict between him and the monkey, but the ending was left very confusing."
" ""Kubo and the Two-Strings"" a treasure-trove of Gifts presented equally to the eyes, mind, heart and even Ears!
",0.0,0.9781,2019-06-05 00:00:00,9,"""Kubo and the Two-Strings"" is an incredibly unique, imaginative-artistic, philosophical and emotionally-resonant film and a truly groundbreaking achievement from the American stop-motion animation company ""Laika Entertainment"" (who produced ""Coraline"" and ""Boxtrolls"" previously).""Kubo and the Two-Strings"" is amazingly-ambitious in terms of both beautifully rendered meticulously-complex stop-motion animation; and also for its rich narrative content and intriguing Story which sheds considerable light on Japanese/Asian philosophical viewpoints regarding mortality, self-sacrifice, familial-bonds, personal-destiny, ancestry-remembered & even rejuvenated, etc.Of course the high-degree of animation-artistry that ""Laika"" studios has lavished on ""Kubo"" is impressive to the point of being nearly mind-boggling = how do they 'breathe' so much authentic tactile 'Life' into these eccentric and mystical characters? This is not merely high-tech CGI, since the lead characters of Kubo, Monkey, Beetle (giant-Skeleton, and of course those magical living-Origami) were actually all physically & meticulously built & hand-crafted, first as highly-detailed character models that were then animated thru 'Stop-motion' techniques and later enhanced thru judicious application of CGI. This definitely gives the characters a more 'tactile' substantial and Life-like feel to them.This story also unfolds in unusual/ non-traditional ways, as Kubo himself becomes a burgeoning storyteller (and even mini-animator-artist within the bounds of this animated film) when he enthralls villagers with his magical-musical Shamisen (handed down by his equally musical and powerfully-mystic Mother/Okaasan) that has the power to literally bring colorful-paper Origami to miraculous 'Life' as Kubo plucks the magical 'strings' of the shamisen = the living-Origami then relate fascinating and exciting Stories of samurai adventure, etc. (but usually without satisfying endings). Kubo cannot provide endings to these tales, because he himself is yearning to find-out/ learn more about them. His Mother shares tantalizing fragments of her past when she is able, but Kubo senses that there is much more to his Mother's mysterious past (along with his long lost-samurai father's ultimate fate & destiny) that has not yet been fully-revealed.Kubo's deeply-mystical heritage begins to reveal itself in menacing-form and life-threatening ways after Kubo has been out too late one night (in an attempt to contact his father's ancestral spirit at an 'Obon' ceremony to honor the dead), the dreaded 'Moon King' exploits the precise moment to set-Loose his darkly-magical twin-evil daughters, arriving to steal Kubo's single remaining 'good-eye' before his mother can intervene with her equally-powerful protective magic (but at what cost?)Don't want to give away more of this Story since much of the perilous-danger and personal-revelations presented to Kubo are linked directly back to his mysterious family heritage (both his Mother's mystical side and his father's noble warrior sides of the family). Suffice to say that along the way, deep-sacrifices must be made in order for destinies to come to fruition and Kubo's harrowing tale is awash with genuine emotional-resonance and major moments of authentic contemplation & compassion (and fateful choices).""Kubo and the Two Strings"" presents a treasure-trove of gifts equally to the eyes, mind and heart (and don't forget the ears = 'While My Guitar Gently weeps' is a most fitting musical refrain, with a brilliant new version for this soundtrack by Regina Spektor, even featuring expert-Shamisen studio musicians!)Note: and for Classic animation fans, the terrifying-Behemoths and Gigantic-mythical-creatures that Kubo must confront and defeat on his mission to fulfill his hallowed destiny = appear to pay homage to stop-motion master-animators of the past like Ray Harryhausen!"

",0.4939,0.9628,2019-05-21 00:00:00,9,"Kubo deals with dark themes such as loss, incapacity, and growing up. It doesn't shy away from frightening imagery. It also sports excellent characters with Kubo and his companions which are all endearing and well written. This film is complete in its themes and its intentions. It's also emotionally-stirring with several moments that made me cry. Children need to see films like this to understand challenging concepts. It might not be easy, but they do appreciate a film not treating them like they are immature or foolish. As for the animation itself, it's amongst the finest stop-motion I've ever seen, so incredibly smooth it made the people I watched it with (people that find stop-motion unsettling) completely love it. This film deserves every ounce of critical acclaim and love it gets. Please give it yours."
" Good story with some gorgeous visuals but forgettable characters
",0.5346,0.9866,2019-04-23 00:00:00,7,"A young boy in a fictional feudal-Japan, accompanied by two initially reluctant guardians, sets out on a quest for the magical weaponry he needs to protect himself from his wicked grandfather, the Moon King. The stop-motion animation is excellent and some of the imagery outstanding (the underwater search for example), but I didn't find the look or voices of the three main characters to very interesting or engaging (as opposed to the Sisters, who were great). Kubo's human face lacked any 'personality' (compared to, for example 'Coraline' (2009), also animated by Travis Knight), Monkey's visage looked like a chew-toy, and Beetle just seemed gimmicky. The script is a bit mawkish at times and some of the (IMO) anachronistic comic-relief occasionally jerked the story out of context (but humour is a very personal thing and I am not the film's target audience). The story was imaginative and interesting but was undermined a bit by Kubo's magical-musical ability to do whatever was needed to advance the plot (even in the most fantastical stories I like some 'rules'). All in all, visually impressive but not a classic."
" Excellent animated movie
",0.5719,0.913,2019-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Kubo and the Two Strings was directed by Travis Knight. Although the story takes place in Japan, it's a U.S. film. (I was surprised that no Japanese names were in the credits.)The movie is hard to describe--it's partly a growing-of-age film, partly about origami, and partly a fairy tale with ghosts and dragons.I think that the unusual plot makes this is a great film for young people, who are accustomed to astounding animation. For me, the animation was everything. It's dazzling.The movie would work better on the large screen. We saw it on the small screen, and it was OK. It's not a must-see movie, but it's worth watching if you enjoy state-of-the-art animation."

",-0.1531,0.9934,2019-03-21 00:00:00,7,"'Kubo And The Two Strings (2016)' is a visually-stunning and suitably entertaining stop-motion animation from the studio behind two of the medium's most accomplished works. It never quite manages to match the overall quality of those aforementioned titles, especially when it comes to story and character, despite the fact that it more than rivals them in terms of pure, gloriously frame-by-frame spectacle. Where the flick falls ever-so-slightly flat is in its narrative, as the ambitious yarn never quite knits together as neatly as you'd expect it to. Don't get me wrong; it's enjoyable, unique and generally well-told, taking a few bold turns that show it isn't afraid to challenge the youngest in its 'all ages' audience. There are some exciting set-pieces, which are animated incredibly well, and some engaging character interactions, too. It's just that its ideas and themes don't necessarily conflate all that satisfyingly, and are sometimes just strangely presented, to boot. There is also a somewhat odd pacing that sees the third act feel incredibly rushed and, essentially, lacking in a proper denouement. I will also say that the choice to not cast Japanese - or, at least, Japanese-American - actors in the lead roles is a bit of a shame, as well as a missed opportunity. Though, it is nice to see a film that's inspired by and rooted in Japanese culture. Overall, the picture is an enjoyable adventure that has several accomplished set-pieces and a few emotionally-resonant moments, thanks to its believable relationships. Despite its few story and pacing issues, it's a fun time that pushes stop-motion, visually, in all the right directions. 7/10"
" Quite possibly the best animated movie I have enjoyed.

It manages on all grounds, following a trend I truly love from Laika Studios where they truly want to tell a story and go for it, without aiming to ride the cliche and trends of the month wave to farm easily swayed crowds, presenting a mature story with imaginative turns at every corner.
No amount of stars do justice to how much I love the effort put behind this movie, and I would never take anyone seriously if they were to tell me otherwise."

",0.8555,0.997,2019-03-08 00:00:00,9,"We live in the future, and it is incredible. I've found stop-motion animation to be a fascinating medium, not only for its ""dirtiness"" when compared to CGI, but also because of the painstaking care it takes to produce a full-length feature with this process. Animation studios like Aardman and Laika are really starting to take advantage of all the tools at their disposal to create some awesome stop-motion movies. We've come a long way since the films of Henry Selick, the most famous one being The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993). Through Selick, we now have a handful of fantastic films through the Laika brand.While their previous work, The Boxtrolls (2014) had started the trend away from more morbid themes and plots, Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) shows just how capable the stop-motion medium is to tell a fantastic story. With an origami motif existing throughout, Kubo and the Two Strings is a fantastic example of what 3-D Printing can do for the stop-motion animation industry. In fact, the almost transparent qualities of the characters allowed the light to more realistically interact with their bodies, immersing the viewer even further into the story. People who haven't had much interaction with 3-D printing probably didn't notice it, but I certainly did.Even though the plot may have been a bit ""video game""-ish at times, the structure was almost faithfully that of a classic fairy tale. The themes of love, loss, family, duty, and honor are all present in this Japanese setting, thus hammering home the emotional impact of the characters' actions with each turn. I was certainly in tears during several segments because of how touching they were. With this plot, the style of animation, and the technical achievements to make it a reality, I would be shocked if Laika does not win their first Oscar for Best Animated Feature next year because of this film.A visually stunning, modern fairy tale that shows off the amazing talents of the Laika team, I give Kubo and the Two Strings 4.5 stars out of 5."

Stop animation requires a very hardworking team and a lot of patience. And it is clearly evident in the final product, a movie so visually vibrant that you will everything is CGI.The animation is seamless, the set pieces and environment are well made. Enough attention is given to the characters. Their unique moments and characteristics are well highlighted.I really appreciated that cinematography of the movie. The scenes are extremely well lit, balancing the tone of the film from time to time.The only thing lacking in the movie is the poor script. Okay, the premise is good. A romance between a magical princess and a warrior, their exile and the hunt for the heir. The magic justifies the plot and is portrayed in a really good manner.But it suffers from a lot of issues. First thing is that they didn't do justice to the magical world itself. All we saw was a village and a few places during the quest. What are other people like? Do they know magic? What kind of magics are there? Certainly not just Guitar magic.Also, the quests were very short. It almost felt like these people just stumbled upon them in their travel. And also very easy. They can be conquered by even normal people. Not much magic required.And lastly, it tried hard to have some twists and turns. But they were very predictive.Overall, as children movie, it served a good narrative. But could've been better with more depth to the world and the quests."

This story of a boy on a quest has one of the most fascinating stories that I've seen. It just goes to show that a cartoon feature doesn't necessarily need finely honed animation or a high budget. If it has a good story, that suffices (although make no mistake, this movie has some impressive animation). I recommend it.It was neat hearing a version of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" during the credits. Not only did the White Album turn 50 last month, but that song was my favorite from the album. Right after George Harrison died, I heard a version containing a few lines that George didn't use in the original release.PS: Travis Knight is the son of Nike founder Phil Knight.

" Unemotional and superficial story but perhaps a hidden meaning

The premise of the story is somewhat loose without solid explanation and purpose. The boy essentially embarks on an adventure without really knowing the purpose or the consequences. Also I would seriously doubt that any child of any age would be so candid and feeling like pulling off jokes and pranks at the same time his village is destroyed and his mother died, unless he is a psychopath.
The only thing that might save this story is the hidden meaning that reminds me of Pan's Labyrinth. That is, all that adventure the boy embarks on is his imagination to actually let go of his already diseased parents and accept his grandfather as his family and a caring person rather than evil for being alive. There were several cues that may suggest that case as for example the forgetfulness of his parents (in his young mind he cannot fully grasp memories), the emphasis on storytelling for the people who passed on, and lastly the gear which he strives to get hold of and later abandoning (indestructible sword, armor and helmet) to break the magic/curse of his grandfather which could signify one's sheltering from reality (denial) and then shedding it to reveal the truth (acceptance). I don't know if that is what the writers were trying to convey but that would make it slightly more interesting."

This return to the past is also evident in the themes of the film that are categorically classic. Maybe too much, since the script puts the Japanese fantasy to perfection but does not dare to get out of the traditional account model.
All in all, they are small problems for which it is undoubtedly the best work of the Laika studio."

Kubo is unconventionally ambitious for stop-motion cinema: it's an action film that has the screenplay, emotional beats and direction of a multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster. And it works really well: even better than a good majority of those aforementioned blockbusters.Kubo is like a stop-motion anime that's tapping into something the medium hasn't really explored in a broad sense: maturity and unwavering loyalty to relatable drama and mythological story-telling. Kubo is a brave attempt for the American animation industry and it's something a lot of us want but aren't aware we actually desired in the first place. It's bold, beautiful and fast-paced fun.5/5 stars."

Although this movie is pretty old now, I decided to watch it again recently, and I still think that it is a great film. The animation is top class, and the storyline is entertaining and enjoyable throughout. It didn't really smash the box office, after not getting a huge release but it's one of those films that is definitely worth a watch. It follows a young boy, Kubo (Art Parkinson), who looks after his mum in a cave after she suffers brain damage when she hits her head on a rock whilst travelling across the ocean. He lives a normal life in a quiet village, until a spirit returns from the past, which turns his life upside down. Having to escape from the village, to save his life, his mother recruits a little Snow Monkey, voiced by Charlize Theron, and a Beetle, voiced by Matthew McConaughey to look after him while he searches for a special magical suit of armour once worn by his father, who was a legendary Samurai Warrior. While Kubo is on his quest, he is attacked by his mother's evil sister sand his grandfather who stole his left eye. With the odds stacked up against him, the 12-year-old Kubo manages to get to the suit before his evil grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) comes face to face with him but the traumatic journey leaves Kubo all alone to fight against the magical warrior. There are some touching moments throughout the movie, and it quite funny in parts, so there really is something for everyone. It's a bit difficult for the kiddies to follow but the monkey and the beetle will keep them entertained. Although there are some big names in the cast, it seems like it got the low budget treatment, which is a shame because it is much better than the bigger movies that weren't that great. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it for the whole family.Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Travis Knight, who also produced ParaNorman and The Boxtrolls. Although his previous movies were primarily for a young audience, this movie really does tug at the heartstrings, and the various cast members, all contributed something fresh to this original movie. The profit margin wasn't that great, which basically means that there won't be a sequel anytime soon but I hope that it's one of those movies that people will give a chance in the future.Budget: $60million

However, their computer animated cartoons aren't the only type of animation. Studio Ghibli with their superb hand-drawn animation has garnered quite a few followers over the course of its lifetime, they stayed true to their traditional brand of animation up until their temporary halt in 2014. One studio has embraced one of the oldest type of animation as their distinctive type of animation, which is stop-motion. That studio is Laika Entertainment, they have produced some of the most well known stop-motions in recent years. Coraline, Paranorman and The Boxtrolls are the movies that they have produced. They were decent, but I can understand why they weren't as well known as some of the Pixar movies. On 2016 however, I think they have produced their magnum opus.Kubo and the Two Strings tells the journey of Kubo, a young boy who lives a peaceful yet mysterious life. When he accidentally summoned a vengeful spirit however, he will embark on a quest that will explain his past.This movie is a fantasy movie. However, those who watch fantasy movies and expect a tight logical sense will find no satisfaction here. The movie will suddenly throw some bizzare magic and give no explanation whatsoever about the origins of that magic. If you get trapped in trying to figure out how it happened then I'm afraid you could miss out on it's wonder. I think in order to fully immerse yourself in the world of Kubo, you just need to let go, and fantasize.What I love most about this movie is the depth that this movie posess. It has a story that is similar to that of a fairy tale, but when a fairy tale usually tackles the theme of virtues such as honesty, friendship and perseverance, Kubo and the Two Strings tells a story about life, death and how each one brings all the more meaning to the other half. The movie treats these topics with such maturity that I certainly didn't expect from a family movie. Much like Coco, Pixar's 2017 movie, it handles such heavy topics with love and humor, making a digestable piece of cinema that could be appreciated by the whole generation and perhaps, the generations to come. This movie has a message that really resonated with me. I often have thoughts about mortality and death in general, not because I crave for it, mind you. In fact, the concept of it is terrifying for me. I always view death as this bottomless void that isolates you with its loneliness. This movie opened my mind into a whole new perspective on death, a perspective that doesn't view it as a defeat, but rather as a happy ending."

The Villain's motive is almost nonexistent. He wants to get to Kubo so he can take his other eye for...WHAT PURPOSE! Is it just because he's a bad dude? This and many other things aren't explained clearly enough.The dialogue is also over-dramatic. It takes itself way too seriously and when they try to add comedy, It just seems out of place.The main problem lies in the casting. While the actors they chose gave a good performance, They chose not to cast any Asian actors to portray the ASIAN characters. This film is too recent to be snubbing Minority actors. The only non-white voice actors they hired were portraying very minor characters with little lines.

The story was charming, and even exceptionally enthralling for the first half of the film, but slows to a halt during Act III, crippling its momentum. The art style alone makes this movie worth watching, and I will see anything that took this much work and artistic talent on the big screen in coming years."
" Very good in general but with some blatantly weak points
",-0.4124,0.995,2018-06-16 00:00:00,7,"If you wanna find a great story with lots of jokes, this is not the movie for you. However if you wanna see great animation in step motion, which is incredibly beautiful and fascinating, and you don't mind getting immersed in an emotional story with magic, definetly check this one out.
So here is my opinion about anything while trying t keep it spoiler free.
The animation is gorgeous and so pleasing to watch even when nothing is happening.
The characters are simple with no depth. They do their job, you understand them well and root for the good guys while you hate the bad ones. It didn't bothered me but it might be annoying for some people.
The humor is absent for a big part of the movie, then it doesn't get exceptionally good. It's decent for when it is, it doesn't get dumb or awkward, but it's not very original either. The good part about it is that I found it appropiate to be absent for like half of the movie considering this is a movie with a lot of sad scenes.The story is the weakest part to be honest. It's a simple run away from evil in a quest to find some item with some twists. That wouldn't be a problem if the twist weren't so predictable and dragged on and then the characters acting genuinely surprised when they find the truth. There is only one twist I didn't see it coming, maybe 2 or 3. That's it.
Another problem is that Kubo causes the sad scenes by being dumb. Nobody even mentions his obvious mistakes. It's not even excused by ""oh he didn't know that would happen"". He should have known after all his mother told him. They tried to explain it in a line like ""I don't know what is real anymore"" but that doesn't work when you have a soft magic system (aka unexplained magic). You are supposed to trust the one other magic user you know for this kind of stuff.
Speaking of magic, the magic system is ""eh"". It's very very pretty to look at it but it doesn't feel engaging when they fight with magic because of it. Also Kubo's magic (and not only his) leave so many questions with not even a vague answer. I know it's supposed to be unexplained for the most part, but not like that.
The last problem I have is the ending. It has some good ideas, but they are rushed. If something with consenquences happen and you don't wanna erase what happened by magic at least give the audience and the characters time to mourn and show some scenes later in the story to make it feel like it's not that bad. How is Kubo's life after all that has happened? How is the village? Nope they just rushed over it.
The messages were fine, not very original but I don't see a problem in that. I would have liked them more if they didn't became increasingly obvious as the movie progressed.In conclusion is a good movie, too bad the story hold it back to being a 10/10. However this issues didn't stop me from enjoying the movie very much while watching and even crying a bit. If you want a perfect story or a lot of jokes, don't watch it. But otherwise is a very pleasing experience for the eyes and the heart and I recommend you watch it."

And so he embarks on a journey to find his salvation, accompanied by a monkey and an amnesiac samurai beetle.There is quite a lot of story here and, although it purports to be a film for youngsters, there is actually much here for adults. I enjoyed the story, which ventured into some unexpected places and was possibly a little dark and scary for the very young (the sisters are creepy, and some unhappy things happen to various characters). I particularly liked the ending, which wrapped up the emotional side of things well - this film does have some very emotional moments in it, so be prepared for some surreptitious eye-wiping - while not going for the full Disneyfied happy ending.Visually, while I would criticise it for being quite dark a lot of the time, making 3D viewing especially troublesome (and the 3D is quite good), the design is gorgeous and the animation - stop-frame, though it is difficult to believe that the water work is not CGI - is superb.The voice work is outstanding. Art Parkinson as Kubo effortlessly holds centre stage throughout, but Charlize Theron as Monkey and Matthew McConaughey as Beetle are superb.

Kubo most locate pieces of a suit of armor to stand a chance of not going completely blind. Now this is the new stop motion feature from Laika Entertainment, and they have the stop motion animation game on lockdown. Seriously, the process of stop motion is so immensely tedious and time consuming that I cannot even begin to comprehend the man-hours that went into this. They've got something really good with Kubo, and while it's a fairly simple story being told, all of the artistry that went into this is nothing short of breathtaking. The story is not overly intricate, but not every tale has to be. It's very straightforward and will likely be familiar if you have seen more than a half-dozen fantasy movies, or even heard your share of bedtime stories, for that matter. It lays everything out for you in the opening ten minutes with Kubo's storytelling to the townsfolk, and it then proceeds to show you that story happen to Kubo. One of the coolest effects in this is Kubo's special ability: he has this shamisen (an instrument that is similar to a guitar), and when he plays it, he can make paper do whatever he wants. It leads to some jaw dropping visuals, and I quite frankly do not understand how exactly they got this looking as tight and as seamless as they did. Just like in The Boxtrolls, you don't fully appreciate the film until you get to the end credits where they give you just a small taste of the animators at work, and you see them put together a 10 second scene at 100x speed. I honestly don't know how kids are going to respond to this, as there are a number of unexpected horror elements to it; there's a scene pretty early on with ""the sisters"", and it is something that is straight out of a modern effective horror thriller, which could potentially give children nightmares. There is so much style, great music, and attention to detail, it's hard not to love it, at the very least from an appreciation standpoint. I would love to see a ""making of"" documentary on this, it really is that well crafted. The animation is the star, and Laika has outdone themselves."
" Fantastic!
",0.5983,0.9673,2018-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Another solid film from studio Laika. It's really unfortunate that this technically tanked at the box office. It's Laika's highest rated film...yet made less than its previous three films. I'm hoping it finds some life on home video and the award buzz surrounding it helps out. The film is about a young boy named Kubo (Art Parkinson) who tells stories to the villagers in the small village beneath his home where he uses magic from his guitar to make origami characters appear. One night he is attacked by the Sisters (Rooney Mara) which leads him on a journey to find the three sacred items that will allow him to destroy the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) and restore peace to the land. Along the ride for him is Monkey (Charlize Theron) a guardian who has a deep dark secret. Then there's the clueless Beetle (Matthew McConaughey) who doesn't exactly remember everything. The film itself is beautiful. Stop motion at its finest and it weaves together a wonderful tale about loss and memory, but also deals with healing and love. It's great and I can't recommend it enough. I will say the only gripe I had with it was the film ended and I had a few questions that never get answered. Overall, solid animated film good for the whole family give it a look!"
" Despite Impressive Animation, Lame Comic Dialogue Sinks Action Fantasy, Patronizing Towards Adults and Inappropriate for a Younger Audience
",-0.0951,-0.992,2018-04-06 00:00:00,4,"Kubo and the Two Strings is Travis Knight's animated stop-motion fantasy adventure film set in a feudal Japan voiced by a coterie of prominent actors. The overall effort is disappointing as so much excellent work went into the visual side of the film but little into the dialogue which can best be described as sophomoric and simply not funny. 
Don't plan on taking your kids to see this as the story as it has an undercurrent of nasty characters who might be a little too scary for children. When we're first introduced to Kubo (Art Parkinson), the young protagonist, he already has had his eye plucked out by his evil grandfather (""The Moon King"" voiced by Ralph Fiennes) and his two aunts (a Japanese variation on the bad witches from the ""Wizard of Oz"") who are out to kill his mother, Sariatu (Charlize Theron) who was cast out by the family after marrying Kubo's now missing dad, Hanzo.  
Soon enough, the aunts (i.e. the witches) kill Kubo's mother and Kubo learns he must find three talismans to assist him in eventually defeating his grandfather. They include armor, a sword and a breastplate. Just as in the Wizard of Oz, Kubo is assisted by three characters who protect him from the wrath of his aunts. First there's ""little Hanzo,"" Kubo's own Origami creation, who resembles his father, a Samurai warrior, along with a Monkey who comes to life from Kubo's monkey amulet given to him by his mother (the monkey is also voiced by Theron) as well as a Beetle/man hybrid (Matthew McConaughey). 
It's soon revealed that the Monkey and the Beetle are manifestations of Kubo's parents but hardly approximate their grandeur. The Monkey's lines in particular are quite grating, as she spends most of her time insulting the Beetle, who comes off as foolish and ineffectual. Nonetheless, the two manage in the end to sacrifice themselves and kill the aunts, so that Kubo can have his final confrontation with the evil grandfather. 
As I mentioned at the beginning, a great deal of thought went into animating this enterprise and most of it is quite impressive. However, when it comes to the animation of the grandfather's spirit (which takes the form of an ordinary dragon), one must conclude that the film's animators could have created a more interesting and compelling (final) monster/adversary for little Kubo. 
The ending is at least appropriate as Kubo uses the strings from his Shamisen (banjo-like instrument), culled from his mother's hair, which enables him to neutralize his grandfather's powers and transform him to a feeble old man, on whom the villagers (from Kubo's nearby town), take pity. 
Despite the impressive animation, the film's inappropriate comic tone undermines the filmmaker's serious intent, and relegates the overall effort as a lame attempt that patronizes the adult audience while at the same token, ends up scaring its base of young children."
" Kubo and the Two Strings- simple yet great!
",0.6588,0.9867,2018-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Stop motion animation has always been one of my favorite filmmaking techniques, from Aardman Productions to even the ATATs in Star Wars. ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", deserves to be among the titles when you list ""the great stop motion movies"". The story had me hooked from the beginning, and the animation was superb. Kubo and the two strings tales place in a world where magic and humans live together, inspired by ancient Japanese culture, where a boy sets out on a quest to restore peace to his family. The cast was really good, I thought, and I especially loved Charlize Theron's performance as Monkey. The color palette of the film made me not want to take my eyes of the screen and, combined with the animation, was breathtaking. Even though this movie was aiming for the enjoyment of kids, the jokes still landed for me and I still felt the emotion conveyed, especially at the end. The characters The Sisters even made me feel a bit creeped out at times, which was great. In the battle scenes, I felt threatened and in the emotional scenes, I felt sad. This movie, I thought, really did well with conveying emotion. Although I loved the story this movie told, I thought the plot felt rushed at times. This is understandable, though, as they had a pretty low budget and claymation takes a lot of time for not very much product."

Many animated movies are deemed ""kid' movies"" due to them being simplistic and always being wrapped up in a neat bow with everyone happy and smiling, but this does not do that.

" A fun and unique adventure
",0.6808,0.9312,2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'Kubo & The Two Strings' is a stop-motion animation film set in ancient Japan - and it's superb. Kubo (Parkinson) is a young, one-eyed boy who lives outside a small town and tells stories with origami characters that come to 'life' when he plays his guitar - this is amazing to watch and expertly done. When he finds out his Grandfather is the Moon King (Finnes) who wants to steal his remaining eye, he sets out on a quest to find the mystic armour.He's helped by Monkey (Theron), his guardian, & Beetle (McConaughey) a samurai man-sized rhinoceros-beetle - Beetle has the best lines and quips in the film and really adds to the adventure. PG is right - I'm not sure I'd let a child under 8 see this, due to some of the darker scenes and it does deal a fair bit with death and spirits (the 'sisters' (Mara) are particularly scary!). This studio, Laika, is on a roll ('Coraline', 'ParaNorman' and 'The Boxtrolls' - all good), and with 'Kubo', they're starting to give Pixar a run for their money!The plot is essentially predictable, but it's the heart the actors and animators infuse the characters with that makes this film stand out. It looks stunning and there's plenty of imaginative and original things that pop-up throughout. Highly recommended."
" A welcome addition to the crowded animated genre
",0.4588,0.9737,2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Every month seems to bring another big budget animated film. I just wish all of them were this beautiful and original. Yes, Kubo finds adventure and laughter, but - more importantly - his journey surprises at every turn. From the moment you first see origami dancing, you know that this movie will be unique. And the happiness you find along the way is richer because it's tinged with a grief that rings true."
" Stunning visuals, weak story!
",-0.1511,0.9605,2017-10-18 00:00:00,7,"Warning: this review contains many spoilers!I was so excited to watch this movie after reading the many many very positive reviews but I felt disappointed after doing that. Visually the movie is a masterpiece but I think the unoriginal story and plot holes ruined it. The story seems Dragon Quest IV, there's a boy (a little bard who plays an old guitar-like instrument) which must destroy a monster (his uncle) by collecting the pieces of a legendary armor (sword, armor and a helmet). He travels through the world with the help of his mother (incarnated inside a body of a monkey) and a weird looking scarab-human warrior (he's his dad but, trust me, it took me few seconds to figure out it was his father). So they found the magic sword stuck inside a huge living monster head (but if the sword is so powerful then why it's stuck inside a monster head and the monster doesn't die?). They found the armor under the sea (just how did it get down there?) and the helmet which was widely exposed, you won't believe this... outside Kubo's village (so the legendary helmet was in Kubo's village all the time and no one noticed that?). Meanwhile Kubo's mom and dad die while protecting him from the two evil sisters and Kubo faces his evil uncle in the final battle. In the end Kubo defeats his uncle by playing his guitar with a string of his mom hair, a string of his hair and the string of his father's bow. So the journey in search of the legendary artifacts was...completely pointless (he could play the guitar with the strings way before and his mom and dad would be still alive). Kubo's uncle turns into a nice guy (I don't know how) and the movie ends. Final score 7/10.Kubo and the two string is a good movie. It has stunning visuals, great graphics, memorable characters and good dialogues but it would be a true masterpiece if wasn't for its unoriginal story and plot holes. Overall the movie is a bit overrated but I can recommend it to everyone."
" A delightful animated myth from Studio Laika
",0.5859,0.9955,2017-10-05 00:00:00,9,"In the opening scenes a woman crosses a sea in a small boat with her small, one eyed child. As they reach land she is injured when she hits her head on a rock. Years pass and she is clearly unwell thanks to her injury. The child, Kubo, is now twelve and looks after her. He earns money telling stories which are magically animated by origami characters as he plays a shamisen. One story in particular tells of a samurai who confronted the Moon King little does he know but the story isn't as mythical as he thought. His mother warned him that he must always be home before the sun sets or his grandfather will find him and take his remaining eye.Inevitably one day he stays out too late is confronted by his two aunts who intend to take him to his grandfather and his mother helps him flee. When he wakens he is in a snow-covered landscape with a talking snow monkey, which claims to be the charm he carried given life by his mother's magic. If he is to survive unharmed they will have to find three magical items; a sword, breastplate and a helmet. On their way they meet 'Beetle', a samurai who has had his memory taken and been turned into an anthropomorphic stag beetle; he joins them in their quest. As they travel on their quest they must face various threats, including his aunts, before Kubo must ultimately face his grandfather.As with other films from Studio Laika there is a darkness about this animation. The opening scene gives a hint of this as we see blood when Kubo's mother bashes her head; then there is the fact that Kubo's grandfather has taken one of his eyes and plans to take the other with this and 'Coroline' Laika clearly have a thing about taking children's eyes! This doesn't mean it is a bad film, far from it, but it might not be suitable for younger children.I really enjoyed this film; the animation is fantastic and the story is a lot of fun. There are some nice little surprises along the way. The central characters are a lot of fun with Monkey and Beetle providing plenty of laughs as well as poignant moments they certainly aren't just comedy sidekicks. There are lots of creative flourishes; I loved the way the origami animated Kubo's stories and later he used leaves in a similar way to make a boat. The voice cast, which includes plenty of familiar names does a fine job, playing the characters straight rather than getting too hammy. Overall I'd definitely recommend this; especially to anybody who enjoyed Laika's previous films."
" Four words. I love you....monkey.

Kubo is a street performer who utilizes magic and origami to tell long tales. With an ailing mother, Kubo wonders out and the epic story begins as a quest for a sword, shield, and helmet. His companions are a monkey and a beetle. I found the story to be delightful and funny. Charlize Theron as Monkey and Matthew McConaughey as Beetle did great character voices with well written lines."
" An affectionate, yet melancholy tribute to the Eastern influences on Western animation
",0.0,0.8337,2017-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Kubo and the Two Strings is an animated stop-motion film by animation studio LAIKA (Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls). Featuring the voices of Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, and Ralph Fiennes, it is a well-made Western adventure film with a distinct Eastern vibe.In ancient Japan, a young eye-patched boy named Kubo lives in a cave caring for his sick mother. To make a living, Kubo travels down to his local village to perform with his shamisen (a three-stringed instrument), which he uses to magically manipulate origami paper into a story about the legendary samurai warrior Hanzo, his deceased father. One day, Kubo is eventually found by his wicked aunts who are working to bring him to the Moon King, who is responsible for killing Hanzo. After escaping, Kubo then journeys to find the missing pieces of Hanzo's armour and defeat the Moon King once and for all.Featuring beautiful visual effects and a clever story told in the style reminiscent of a Japanese fable, Kubo and the Two Strings is an affectionate, yet melancholy tribute to the Eastern influences on Western animation. The stop-motion look makes the effort and care put into the making of the film seem all the more powerful and impactful. In terms of action, the film has some great sword-fight scenes, almost in the vein of Akira Kurosawa's samurai films, but some moments may be too intense for very young audiences. The voice acting is solid, especially from Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey. However, I feel that it is Art Parkinson who stands out the most as Kubo, he holds the film with perfect composure without ever making his character seem annoying or bratty.I rate it 8/10"
" Beautiful and Ambitious - Laika's Best
",0.9042,0.9959,2017-09-07 00:00:00,10,"In recent years Laika has been developing a flawless reputation, similar to what Pixar use to have and their latest film is easily their best (or at least able to rival Coraline).In a small village in a world similar to Medieval Japan Kubo (Art Parkinson) is a young boy who tells stories for money during the day and cares for his mother at night. However, it turns out the stories that Kubo that were true and he is being hunted by The Moon King and his mother's sisters (Rooney Mara).Compared to other Western animation studios Laika are darker with its storytelling and imaginary and Kubo and the Two Strings continues that trend. The sisters are a wonderfully creepy creation because of the masks they wear and Mara's manipulated voice.As well having the best features of other Laika films Kubo and the Two Strings also works within the Disney and Pixar templates. Kubo is a fantasy story in the vein of recent Disney efforts like Tangled and Moana and gives audiences some great action set-pieces. Whilst like Pixar Kubo has the heart and some of the themes would have fitted in a Pixar film - Kubo's first scene was him caring for his mother who was in a vegetative state. It's the type of scene that could have fitted in the opening of a Pixar film - Wall-E and Up even did that.Throughout the film there is a thematic throughline of what makes a family with Kubo having to find out what makes a family as well as care for his mother. There is also a theme the importance of memory and stories and how they are connected. It gives Kubo a lot of substance.Although Kubo does stray into dark material for a kids film it's not without moments of fun. Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey make for a great double act as Monkey and Beatle, having some great banter and there are some of big action scenes include a fight with a giant skeleton and Monkey fighting one of the sisters who uses a Kusarigama.Kubo and the Two Strings is a great film, working both as a fantasy adventure and as something deeper. It's a great offering from 2016 which itself offered some great animated films."
" Laika's Magnum Opus
",0.0,0.9995,2017-08-31 00:00:00,10,"Where to begin in describing this wonderfully crafted, stylishly animated and emotional tale by the studio behind ""Coraline""? Laika Animation Studios outdid themselves with this Oscar nominated dramedy about a young boy, the titular Kubo, who must shield himself from his evil grandfather who intends to mold the boy into an equally cold, emotionless being. Along the way our hero is aided by a sarcastic spirit animal, Monkey, and a clueless but brave and lovable samurai known as Beetle, the trio endures numerous challenges and tragedy that will keep the heart racing, produce tears, make you laugh and warm your heart.The film assembles an all star voice that includes Rooney Mara as entities who are Kubo's aunts (his mother's sisters) that are in league with the Moon King, Kubo's grandfather, and want to capture our hero for their father's dark purpose. Mara is used sparingly, but to good effect with her girlishly evil giggle and cold vocal delivery. Also used to limited degrees is English thespian Ralph Fiennes as the evil Moon King. The actor's character is only seen at the film's conclusion, but his influence is felt throughout as he sends his wicked daughters to capture his grandson and the stories from Kubo's mother warn us how terrible the Moon King is. When Fiennes finally does appear, he plays his role with coolness, an unsettling calm but quickly flips to drastic measures to get Kubo on his side which ends up futile due to Kubo's strength and goodness.But the greatest vocal performances come from the three leading players of Kubo, Monkey and Beetle: 1. As the sarcastic yet loyal Monkey is the superb Charlize Theron. The talented actress brings the right amount of wit, charisma and care to the touchy animal who comes across as abrasive when we first meet her, but we quickly learn that Monkey just wants to protect Kubo and aid him on his journey. The character's one liners both crack us up and also pull at the heartstrings once we learn who Monkey really is which speaks volumes of Theron's abilities as a thespian. 2. Playing Monkey's hilarious foil is the dimwitted Beetle voiced to perfection by actor Matthew McConaughey. Little is known about Beetle other than what he tells our heroes when we first meet him, but with comedic flair McConaughey makes the character likable immediately. The banter between Beetle and Monkey makes for the film's best uses of humor as McConaughey's carefree attitude combating with Theron's serious purpose puts the characters at odds for the majority of the film's run-time till the two learn to work through their differences as they both care for Kubo. 3. And the all important title character of Kubo is voiced wonderfully by 'Game of Thrones' actor Art Parkinson. The young actor quickly avoids making Kubo a typical protagonist who is conceited or spoiled, but instead as a headstrong boy imbued with great talents who is yet naïve of the wide world around him. Parkinson makes Kubo's journey as well-rounded as Kubo starts off treating his purpose as a bit of a joke which annoys Monkey to no end, but as he forges onward with his companions Kubo begins to learn how to control his magical powers and become a young man. The emotional moments for the character are the defining showcases of Art Parkinson's range as an actor by varying his reactions to the characters around him to never coming across as fake when the tragic moments hit.Laced with a brilliant mix of humor and heart, the screenwriters hit us with emotional punches within the first few minutes as we learn Kubo's origin story. The film switches gears throughout the first act by blending fun whimsical imagery (perfectly captured in Kubo's story about his father that he tells the townsfolk) with sadness in seeing Kubo's mostly mute mother who does what she can to protect her beloved son since her husband, the brave samurai Hanzo, is gone; having sacrificed himself for his family's safety. The script sticks to sarcastic humor once Theron's Monkey is introduced as she and Kubo start off as opposites with her serious over-protectiveness mixed with Kubo's naivety. Once Beetle is introduced and crafted as Monkey's humorous foil with his well meaning bravery, but carefree attitude towards the journey for the magical armor the trio must find, the mood provides laughs thanks again to the hilarity of Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey's abilities to play off each other perfectly and give insight into their characters the third act where twists upon twists are uncovered and we say goodbye to some wonderful characters which will break your heart and send the tears flooding down like waterfalls.Be sure to keep the tissues ready and enjoy this wonderful animated masterpiece."

" Absolutely beautiful and refreshing
",0.6361,0.9786,2017-08-12 00:00:00,9,"First of all, the animation is incredibly detailed, beautiful and atmospheric. It's done mostly stop motion, but with visual effects to enhance some of the scenes such as the waves in the ocean and bright lighting effects. You will want to stare at it from start to finish; every scene is lovely. Some areas with slow motion and heavy action, you can see the cut between frames, but you're unlikely to notice this unless you're very interested in the animation, and it doesn't break the immersion even then.The story, is also very, very good. While some plot twists seem slightly rushed, or you can see them coming, much of the lore and deeper meanings behind parts of the story are buried in dialogue, meaning some younger viewers might be slightly confused or miss certain things. However, the story is also quite heavy, covering very sensitive and deeper themes, such as loss, death and family. It does this in the sweetest, most beautiful way possible, every emotional scene will leave you both crying and smiling.I have to give it a lot of credit for not hiding these themes from children. Many kids movies will step on eggshells, misrepresent or completely ignore, more serious topics even when they're relevant. There is violence, and it can be slightly graphic, they don't shy away from a little blood, but they also are very careful to only use it to enhance the narrative or atmosphere; helping to express the gravity of situations. This movie is suitable for children, even quite young children, but I would suggest you watch it with them as they might have questions. I would compare it to 'Inside out' in the way it treats children with agency and intelligence, but they are so different it's hard to compare.Kubo is a very refreshing character to watch. He feels like a real person; so does every other character. Everyone, even the background characters and 'bad guys' are brimming with creativity and personality. This movie does an amazing job of showing the good in everyone, and the bad in everyone. One more amazing thing about this movie; it makes you think. It has plenty of funny and lighter moments, as well as action and adventure. Many hints and subtle clues are dropped in dialogue and background details, the fan theories are fascinating, so there's plenty for the more serious viewers... Those of us who like to watch something 20 times to find every easter egg. ****Spoilers below****One of the only complaints I have about this movie, is the way they use a very heavy topic as a plot device. In the beginning, the mother gets a severe head injury saving her baby; it's shown later she had severe brain damage in a way, but it seems to come and go as it's convenient. She is completely catatonic at times, but suddenly able to rush to the rescue the second she's needed. This is a very minor thing, as it's generally portrayed in a compassionate and sensitive way, but the plot convenience can be quite obvious with how suddenly she seems to switch between fully functioning and not.***Slight trigger warning***Both parents die at the end, watching this movie is an emotional roller-coaster all the way, but if you've dealt with a lot of loss, it might upset you a little more. If a child has lost a parent, or a parent is sick or in hospital, now isn't the time to watch it. It's definitely worth watching still, but if this is a sensitive topic for you, go in prepared."

It's a movie for everyone, you can watch this film in a more mature point-of-view while enjoying the fantastic action sequences. Remember, this is a stop-motion animated movie! It's amazing how they were able to achieve a masterpiece of this level, it's a brilliant achievement in directing.The characters are so captivating and interesting, the Monkey (Charlize Theron) is such a beautiful one, she steals the entire movie. Kubo almost brought me to tears at the end, I cared for him since the very first line and he's definitely going to be a character to remember. Every supporting character was great and my only minor issue with the whole movie is related to the ""villain's"" motivations (they aren't quite clear).I love how the depth that the characters had, it's such a surprisingly heartfelt and emotional movie rather than just a cool action film for kids. There's actually some scary scenes that I don't even think kids should watch! That's how good it is!

I found that to be quite amazing considering the seamless manner in which the characters interacted and how the story moved along. I can't even begin to imagine the incalculable number of repetitious movements required to achieve the effect rendered here, it's really quite staggering. It's almost as if the story itself takes a back seat to the artistic animation the film makers strived to achieve. That story does start out as uniquely creative and imaginative, though as it progressed, I thought Young Kubo's mission became more and more clichéd with the revelations of who the Beetle Warrior and the Monkey turned out to be. Nor was it clear to me why the evil sisters and the Moon King wanted to steal Kubo's remaining good eye. Maybe it was explained, but if it was, it sailed right by me. So all in all, the film was a visual delight but somewhat weak in story telling, though I'd recommend it for an appreciation of the talent and hard work involved in creating it."

Wonderful characters, comedy that maintains throughout without going overboard, and very meaningful themes propel this to the top of my best of list. But the real joy is the most obvious attribute; the beautiful stop motion animation. I was curious about the making of the film, so I watched some behind-the-scenes time lapse videos. Unbelievable, truly. The precision to make these moves so believable, and so heartwarming is more than I can even comprehend. I have seen stop motion films in the past. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a holiday favorite, for both Christmas and Halloween. But this film was something different. I was completely pulled in by the pageantry, and the attention to ancient Japanese proverbs was a home run. I have very few negative comments. In fact, I don't think I have any. Do yourself a favor, watch the film and enjoy watching young Kubo finish a quest started by his late father. You won't regret it!"

",0.9186,0.9694,2017-07-04 00:00:00,9,"Laika's latest animation, Kubo and the Two Strings, further proves their credibility with a beautifully crafted world of full of endless imagination and matches its own animation with a thrilling adventure full of fantasy, myth, and surprisingly melancholy, as well as a small batch of great and lovable characters and a premise that will remain timeless and provide pleasure to viewers of all ages."
" A beautiful and heartful and great story
",0.8402,0.9964,2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Combining a touching story, heartfelt performances and gorgeous, often idiosyncratic animation, Kubo & The Two Strings is one of the best animated movies ever not to have the words Disney, Pixar or Ghibli attached to them. Unfortunately overshadowed by flicks like Moana and Zootopia when it came to award season, it just as much fun as these films are, but is easily far more audacious. The action scenes are genuinely tense, and had me actively hoping the heroes would come out on top, and at times it looks like this might not happen. It's not a typical kid's movie, with some pretty heavy emotionality and themes of loss and grief, but it's done with positive intentions and isn't patronising or inappropriate. It has something for all ages, and deserves just as much praise and attention as the films put out by the aforementioned animated juggernauts.Kubo And The Two Strings takes the typical 'Hero's Journey' to another level in this epic adventure that tells a fascinating story through captivating animation and a beautiful score. The movie transcends far beyond anything ever done in an animated film; it's almost on a Middle- Earth scope as far as fantasies go. It's also entertaining for audiences of all ages and an instant family classic.Beautiful movie with heaps of comedy. Loved the stop-motion and story."
" An absolutely great movie but a bit too predictable
",0.4012,0.9593,2017-06-27 00:00:00,9,"I am in love with this movie. It was cool, interesting, funny and had emotion. The characters were very individual, the story simple to follow, the places interesting and cool and the fights not too drawn out.While I don't think that a movie needs to be completely unpredictable to be good I think this movie was a tad bit too predictable. (SPOILERS ahead... obviously. Why read reviews if you haven't seen the movie?) I also think that the movie could have been a bit more drawn out. It is 1h40min but still feels a bit short a full 2h would most likely do it. It not being too long can however be good for rewatchability. I wish they could have used the extra time to have more of a reconnection between that father and the rest of the family as I was interested in him beyond how he was as a beetle.The movie however ended just how I wanted it too. Bittersweet."
" Kubo and the two Strings, Honest Review
",0.5106,0.999,2017-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Title: Kubo and the Two Strings Director: Travis Knight Genre: Animation, Adventure Family Rating: PG Leads: Charlize Theron, Art Parkinson, Matthew McConaughey Here we go again! This was a random pick from last night. If you were to ask me if I would have ever chose to watch this movie over something else, I would have said no. Just based on the look and title, it isn't something that would really draw you in. That being said I was pleasantly surprised with this movie! The movie 1 hour and 41 minutes long (101 minutes) Which on the surface seems long for an animated movie to me. The animation style is different, going for a more Asian theme, which fits this movie well. It isn't something I am usually a fan of in feature films but it works. This movie has some very well known voice actors that I wasn't;t even aware of until I looked them up. Some have very small roles but it is cool to see big name stars voicing a movie like this. You have Charlize Theron playing the Monkey, Matthew McConaughey playing the Beetle, as the big two. Other notable names in short roles are George Takei as Hosato, Roony Mara voicing The Sisters, and Ralph Fiennes as the Moon King.On to the plot! This movie is based around a small child, who is caring for his mother in a cave like structure. They were ship wrecked after fleeing her family. Her father and two sisters took her son's (Kubo) eye, and killed his father. Her father being the Moon King, Kubo isn't allowed outside after dark, for fear that they will find him and take his other eye. Kubo is a great story teller in the small village close by. He uses his guitar and paper to create wonderful visuals to go along with his stories, but always has to cut his stories short due to the day ending. He never gets to finish his stories and leaves everyone hanging. One night an old women tells Kubo how he can communicate with the dead, so he tries to contact his father. In doing so he stays out after dark and that is when the movie starts getting good. Up until this point the movie is pretty slow and almost makes you not want to watch over an hour more. But I promise it gets better! The Sisters start chasing Kubo and the story takes off. With the help of his Monkey charm, the Beetle, and his mom's left over magic he begins his quest. All of which is laid out in the movie, but I don't want to ruin anything.This movie has a different animation style than most other feature length animated movies. At first I wasn't't sure I would like it the whole time, but it fits well. The story goes into pretty good detail and the movie gets pretty deep. Which you may not expect from a movie like this. I think this movie really sets it self apart from other movies in similar genres. If you remember from my last review, I said that movies in these categories go up against the greats. they have to have something special to stand out and shine above the others. I think this movie does just that. You get a real sense of caring, and compassion when watching this movie. You quickly want certain things to happen, and everything to play out well for the main characters. This movie has conflict, high points, low points, and over all a great story line with great actors. his movie is a pretty complete package.To sum it all up I would recommend this movie to everyone. It has themes that would keep children entertained and is interesting enough to keep the adults in the room satisfied! The acting is great, the story is great, and there isn't much more to say."
" Excellent animation movie
",0.5719,0.9631,2017-06-25 00:00:00,8,"This is a really beautiful and good movie. The story has been taken in very nice way. The movie was very different from other animation movies. The story was approached in an attractive manner. A mother saving her son from her father and sisters who wants her son's eyes. This movie is well-worth to watch even twice. I would say this is one of the best animated movie mixed with emotions, magic, adventure and action."
" Beautiful, though the story has its problems
",0.296,0.9953,2017-06-13 00:00:00,7,"Kubo and the Two Strings is the fourth film from Laika, the studio behind the excellent adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Coraline. In this new all-original story we follow young Kubo as he has to flee from mythical hunters who are after him and his mother's bloodline. For it turns out that his mother is an heiress of the kingdom of the moon and now his grandfather wants him back.Kubo is a 3D stop-motion film and the craftsmanship that went into making it is simply stunning. It looks gorgeous, especially after you realize that most things seen in it are actually there. They, for example, built a giant five meter tall skeleton puppet to play a giant skeletal monster in the film. The art design is also very pleasing, sort of a fantasy samurai world with bright colours and clean designs that reveal intricate textures when you look closer.What really keeps this film from being a great film is unfortunately the story. It's far from being awful and has some genuinely good moments, but it feels more like a myth than a modern story. And not in a good way. The pacing is very much like from a fairytale, but the dialogue, for example, is very modern, which creates a dissonance.Still, the myth-like quality works very well in creating a mood and I can imagine that there are those that find the pacing charming and delightfully different from the norm. Personally I didn't care for it, but I can admire the ambition behind it.And that's Kubo. An admirable movie in many ways and definitely worth a watch for all those looking for craftsmanship."

Laika, also known for its deep, complex thematic elements, does not disappoint with Kubo. The duality in this film is powerful, its presence superseding any issues of predictability. A brooding fantasy, dominated by harsh realities, that takes your soul and returns it brighter. Life and death, mother and father, sun and moon, all explored and intertwined through visuals that seize you without distracting. Humorous, dark, loving, and most of all, real. Flawed, but a step closer to perfection from a company I will continue to keep one eye on. Top 300 film. 8.5/10 — ￼watching Kubo and the Two Strings."

This isn't your typical ""animation"" feature film...it is so much more! I am middle-aged and I absolutely adored this movie because of the rich story, the incredible imagination of the writers, and the attention to detail the studio took to immerse us into a great tale and keep it going throughout.

" If You Must Blink, Do It Now!
",0.0,0.997,2017-05-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie in the technical aspects is perfect but in the story maybe not that much.It tells the story a young boy named Kubo who must locate a magical suit of armour worn by his late father in order to defeat a vengeful spirit from the past, who is chasing him across all the country. The story is well written and keeps you entertained along the whole movie duration but there are some parts I didn't understand at all. Why the grandfather wants to kill him? Why his mother feels like under a curse? This small things don't bother that much but for movie felt like a bit unexplained. The story is not that hard to follow so it keeps you entertained in the hour and a half or so that the movie lasts. The characters are well introduced and the main trio is very funny. Kubo is portrayed by Art Parkinson who did a great job and Charlize Theron did the voice of the Monke but I specially loved Matthew McConaughey as the Bettle and Ralph Fiennes as the Moon King, they both did a great job.But the greatest part of this movie is the animation. All the animations of the characters, the creatures, the landscapes and even the origami figures are done with such a lovely care that is a joy to look at. All this amazing visuals with a beautiful music created by Dario Marianelli helped this movie a lot, that would be worse if we only had the story.This is a very entertaining movie that you can watch with kids or just alone, it doesn't matter because you will probably enjoy it a lot."
" Wanted to Like This a lot More
",0.3612,0.974,2017-05-18 00:00:00,5,"Before watching Kubo and the Two Strings, I was aware of the great reviews the film had received, with some calling it the best animated movie of 2016. Having now watched it, I agree that as far as actual animation goes, this movie is very visually impressive. With the fight scenes in particular, it is impossible to imagine the effort put into the incredible stop-motion in this movie. This movie is undoubtedly amazing in its actual animation, however unfortunately in my opinion that is where its praiseworthy aspects begin and end. I personally found the story of Kubo to be very cookie cutter. Not bad by any means, but painfully average. I didn't find myself caring much about any of the characters, and while watching fight scenes, as I mentioned I was impressed visually, however I was disappointed to find myself not caring what happened to the main characters as a result of the fighting. There is a twist revealed at the end of the second act of this movie which I won't reveal, however I personally was able to figure it out thirty minutes before it happened. The dialogue between Kubo, Monkey and Beetle I thought was very cliché, with Monkey having a slightly humorous pessimistic attitude, and Beetle taking the role of comic relief for the most part. However, through out this whole movie, I did not chuckle even once. All of the jokes felt like anyone could have written them and put them in any average kids movie to me. And perhaps that is why I did not enjoy this movie as much as I hoped I would; it is a kids movie. Granted, many Pixar movies, as well as other stop-motion animation movies like Fantastic Mr. Fox and Coraline (the latter of which was done by the same people as Kubo), I feel are able to be enjoyed equally by adults and kids. This movie felt almost entirely for kids to me. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, in fact I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to let their kids or a kid they know watch. This movie is not bad by any means, I suppose it just simply was not for me. With all of the positive reviews for it though, I would say everyone should watch it and form their own opinion, as perhaps there was just some element I was missing. As of now though, I unfortunately came out of watching this film disappointed."

But kids don't understand this concepts so is a boring movie for them. For me it was a boring movie too. Always trying to make emotions out from the audience with overused resources Animations are very good and I liked it a lot. But the whole movie is slow and low in quality, storytelling and with a cliché in the final scenes. No one will remember kubo in a couple of years."

" A tale that is both visually and emotionally fantastic.
",0.5574,0.9827,2017-05-01 00:00:00,9,"When ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" began, I realized I was in for a treat. The fourth film made by Laika Entertainment, the studio that also released the dark and twisted ""Coraline"", charms and delights in this story that feels like an old Japanese tale that has been passed down years and years through generations of children. However, this story isn't anything you've heard before, it's original. Entirely original that it pays off. Well, for the most part. But, I'll get to that when I get to that.The film opens up with seven chilling words, ""If you must blink, do it now."" The story tells of a boy named Kubo (Art Parkinson). He lives with his mother outside a village where he performs tales about his late great father Hanzo on his magic shamisen using origami which comes to life and moves to the music. However, he cannot stay out past sundown as he is hiding from the boy's grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes), who has stolen one of his eyes and is looking for his other. One day, though, Kubo forgets about his mother's warning to stay out, and his found by his two very disturbing and creepy aunts (Rooney Mara). Using the last of her magic, Kubo's mother uses the last of her magic to get the boy away to safety while also using his snow monkey charm to come to life and protect him from the evil aunts. So, Kubo and Monkey (Charlize Theron) along with a beetle (Matthew McConaughey) set out to find the missing pieces of Hanzo's magic armor and to stop the evil Moon King and his two daughters.The film is the debut film of the CEO of the company Travis Knight and I'm amazed by what he did for his first big project. The animation is gorgeous. When it needs to look beautiful, it looks beautiful and when it needs to look dark, it looks dark. It's a visual marvel, probably one of the best looking stop motion movies I have ever seen in my life. I also really liked the characters. I really like the relationship that Kubo has with the monkey which I feel is genuine. The two aunts are probably some of the creepiest villains I have seen in animated movie in a long, long time. They both wear these disturbing masks in which you can't see their face at all and Mara's creepy voice seals the deal. However, I did have a hard time getting into McConaughey's character as the beetle. He's trying to be the comic relief of the story, but I just couldn't get into his performance because the story was felt serious and adult and didn't need a comic relief. It was a little tough. And now, let's get to the story, which is really incredible. I enjoyed the chilling nature of the tale, and really loved the fight scenes that happen with the the two aunts and the monkey. However, what holds the movie from being perfect is the last third. I'll try my best not to give anything away because this was a major problem. While the first two thirds are incredible and I really enjoyed watching them, but after a certain plot twist happens when the crew needs to find one of the pieces of armor, the film slowly started to slip away. The editing got very odd as the scenes just quickly moved on and they didn't stop to let the audience breathe the atmosphere in the movie. I wasn't a very big fan of Fiennes' character either. While I thought his backstory was understandable, I just didn't him finding creepy or disturbing as the two aunts which is strange considering he's played many villains before in the past like Lord Voldemort. Also, the film didn't give us an ending, it just stopped. I don't know if that was the intent or not, but it just made me feel empty. It was a major disappointment for me.However, I still found ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" incredible. The animation, the characters, and the first two-thirds of the story are probably enough to keep me coming back. It's a real marvel. While I sadly fear, that film might become underrated in a few years, I hope that many people see this incredible film sometime in their life. It's really something to enjoy. If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed."
" Outstanding
",0.6124,0.7096,2017-04-28 00:00:00,9,"This was the most moving and magical animated feature I have seen in years. I've seen all the Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks etc. CGI films and feel that this stands head and shoulders above their recent releases.Using stop motion animation and some CGI, Kubo creates a world that is at once real and fantastic. It has a solid feel to its wondrous and imaginative landscapes that 100% CGI movies still can't quite capture. The story is heartfelt and told without pandering to small children, yet they will still be able to enjoy it, unless their senses have become too deadened by the hyperactive antics found in so many of today's animated films geared toward them. The filmmakers don't soften some of the scary images and situations as we often see in today's PC productions that seem to believe that small kids will be traumatized by a frightening moment in a film.This is a film that the whole family can enjoy."
" The Duality of Life and Death
",-0.5994,0.9922,2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"First off, I love Laika, ParaNorman and Coraline are beautiful movies with amazing messages of self-respect and responsibility, and also forgiveness. Much like Laika's previous works, this is a darker movie, dealing with death, aging, and the fear of being forgotten and forgetting your loved ones. Storytelling-wise, it's very simplistic, a hero's journey in 3 acts: the motivation, the adventure, and the goal. It's more sardonic, humor-wise, and some people didn't appreciate that; it's not forced comedy, it's comedy in light of a struggle. It's clues and hints to the truth. It's literally a hero's tale about a hero's tale, so of course, you have these ""cliche"" stepping stones, but for me, I felt like the mastery of the backgrounds and characters, you get this look at an old idea about an old tale made in a new, vibrant way.Yes, there's clichés, but it makes sense that Beetle and Monkey act the way they do considering who they are, so I don't find fault in that because that's a specific choice by the creators. And yes, the ending is very much ""here's the message again, for those in the back,"" and there's nothing wrong with that.Overall, I gave it a 10 out of 10, because it's beautiful, has a real message, and perfectly represents the hero's journey presented as a folk tale, and that's amazing."
" Wow!... simply, wow!
",0.658,0.996,2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"I rented this as a co-feature in case the other movie turned out to be a dud. This is some of the most exquisitely beautiful and sophisticated animation I've ever seen, and I'm saying this as a 56-year-old lifetime animation fan. The trailers just don't do any justice, if you went by them you'd think this is just another ""me-too"" straight-to-video to compete with Moana. You'd have no idea what you were missing.It's a unique and distinctive stop-motion that often looks and feels - and MOVES - like top- quality CGI.The first time I saw it, it was with my jaw agape, wondering ""HOW did they DO this?!""I initially was convinced it WAS CGI, but started wondering why the hair was so ropy and some textures were so realistic while others were so UNrealistic. And bonus features showed physical models and puppetry, Technically, this movie is astounding, and I would recommend viewing the bonus features and YouTube videos for specifics. That's what I did, and I was so impressed I went ahead and bought it on Blu-RayThe production design and attention to detail is spectacular, as is the authenticity to historical Japanese culture and samurai lore. The background and some effects are CGI, but the integration is often so seamless you can't tell where one stops and the other takes over. And yet with all the realism of stop animation and CGI, NOTHING in this movie is photorealistic. They don't try to make miniatures look like the real thing, which not only showcases the artistry, but also makes a few TRULY SCARY MONSTERS a little easier to view without screaming and sh*tting your pants (I's saying this to the adult viewers, not the kids)The storytelling is a bit heavy-handed and derivative, with a little Disneyesque schmaltz, but certainly not a distraction. A wonderful, often catchy supporting music soundtrack helps pull you along.After seeing this masterpiece, I'm DEFINITELY looking into other Laika Entertainment productions."

",0.4215,0.9946,2017-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Lets see how do I put this... OH yea this stop motion animation is one of my top favorites to have ever witnessed in my 20 years here on earth! The story behind this story is well written and the way stop motion has progressed in recent years has made this film be at its very best. I was sadden that I could not see it on the big screen but as soon as I got on Netflix I was excited it was there so I watched it for the very first time and I enjoyed every scene and exploring every detail in the film. I have never heard of Travis Knight whom directed this film and the only way I ever heard and seen of this film was from a YouTuber who is friends with one of the film makers and that was what got me engaged with the film as that the YouTuber was promoting the film on one of his videos. Which if you would like to search that up the YouTube is Actionmovie Kid. The characters in the film were outstanding and it was funny when monkey and beetle would argue in an adult like humor for the young ones, older kids, and adults would understand. Once Beetle started speaking I quickly figured out who was playing him in which it was Mathew McCaughey! And he did one good job of presenting the character and you could clearly identify the actor if you have seen his other films such as Interstellar which by the way is a must see film. It was hard for me to see errors in the film and it got me thinking on life and the understanding of what brings a family close to one another in even the worst circumstance. Either way I thought the director did a good job but the other films he has done like ParaNorman which I have seen was really good. Overall, this film was worth watching and I am considering buying it digitally like on Googleplay or Mircrosoft."

Combined with similarly beautiful storytelling and visuals, Kubo and The Two Strings is a masterful feast for any movie lover. Filled with heart, emotional scores, humor, and exceptional attention to detail via the filmmakers, Kubo is a true treasure. While the film may not be good for the very young, since it may not hold their attention and some scenes may even scare them, older children and adults alike will surely enjoy this movie many times over.

Zootopia was awesome but come on people, this film took over 5 years to make. It's visually stunning and incredibly emotional. I'm sitting here in tears just thinking about it. You will need to watch it twice just to catch everything that is going on, not to mention listen to the director's commentary just to catch even more of the classic Japanese culture and symbolism that went into making it. Kids, respect and cherish your parents because they love you and they won't be around forever. Parents, hug your kids like it's the last time you will ever see them because it all goes by so fast."

" Nice animation, but painfully clichéd and Americanised
",-0.5719,-0.5017,2017-03-27 00:00:00,4,"""Kubo"" felt wrong from the start and the reason are the completely Americanised characters. I watched the film together with my wife who is Japanese, and one of the first things she said when Kubo met the old lady at the market was ""the way she talks is too American"". Going by her judgment and by my own, having spent a lot of time in Japan and other Asian countries, as well as North America, I can only agree. All the character's mannerisms, body language, facial expressions, behaviour, relationships and everything else that makes a character, are painfully American. I wouldn't even call it ""Westernisation"", it's just distinctly American. I'm talking Mulan-levels of cultural appropriation, possibly worse. It's sad that people who appear to be so into Japanese culture they produce a costly feature-length film about it, hiring expensive Hollywood voice actors, show such shallow of an interest in their subject matter. While in the case of ""Kubo"", the result is just a disappointing film, it's actually quite scary to consider the blatant ignorance with which some Americans approach foreign cultures and mangle them until they fit what they know and understand.While the cultural appropriation is my biggest gripe with the film, the writing itself is also uninspired and the characters are mostly annoying. The plot is as thin as it gets and seems mostly just a necessity to showcase the next big set piece. What that leaves is a lot of fighting, screaming and bickering by the cookie-cutter Disney characters.As for the technical qualities: The animation is rather impressive, while some of the environments feel a bit uninspired and bland. This is the reason I'm giving ""Kubo"" four stars, but it's not enough to make a good film by a long shot."
" Disappointingly Dull
",-0.6808,-0.8123,2017-03-08 00:00:00,2,"The animation is very well-done, but the character and environment designs are uninspired.Despite marketing focusing on Kubo's ability to animate origami figures, he RARELY uses this ability. It's RIDICULOUS. You expect that the film would carry some semblance of him getting more experienced at using his powers for things other than storytelling, but they all but disappear after the first act of the story. Despite the focus on Kubo's shamisen, the soundtrack of the film is very ordinary and unmemorable. It sounds like every other mediocre American film for the most part, when you would expect Japanese influence, especially in the form of... oh, I don't know, a SHAMISEN?Action scenes are somehow dull. It's tough to describe, but they lack energy or the feeling of peril and there are a lot of ""saved at the last minute"" moments. Like, multiple per fight scene. The main characters fight a giant skeleton and it just feels... boring. The fight takes place within a very closed space, which makes the monster look small instead of imposing. The characters don't really use any strategy in the fight, they just seem to let the plot take hold and follow a series of random actions.Voice acting is alright. I liked Charlize Theron as the strong, but motherly figure, but nobody else stood out and Matthew McConaughey feels horribly miscast. The lack of Japanese actors wouldn't bother me so much, if not for the fact that someone seemed to feel obligated to shove them in somewhere, resulting in George Takei, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and a few other Japanese-American actors playing extremely small roles who very well could've been played by anyone. The humour is very clumsy. There are a few times when a joke lands, but most of the time, they're just taking up time that should've been used to expand a character, explain a plot element or enhance the mood of the story. Despite being set in ancient Japan, the Japanese influence is barely tangible. For example: Kubo's father was apparently a samurai, but there's nothing indicating this beyond his armour and the fact that characters say he was. Nothing about the society at the time is really exemplified - the movie could be set pretty much ANYWHERE if names and some aesthetics were changed. Also, despite being an adventure, the world the story takes place in feels impossibly small in a way I rarely experience with a film. Kubo is not an interesting hero, he does not get much character, and never seems particularly motivated by anything other than an insistence by other characters (namely his mother / the monkey) that he HAS to be on this journey. The film (especially near the end) tries to play to the audience's emotions but it does not express enough genuine emotion itself. Also, irritatingly, his whole journey doesn't really reward him with anything, and he doesn't really change because of it. It never felt like he NEEDED to go on it to learn a lesson or gain experience or ANYTHING except that without it there wouldn't be a movie.The villains were uninteresting as their motivations are mostly unclear, and stupid. Like... Kubo's grandfather wants to take his eyes and make him live on the moon with him in order to have him not experience the cruelty of life, but... why does he need to take his eyes? It's oddly convoluted and mixes metaphor and literal actions in a way that will just make you question the plot and if anyone decided to even edit the thing. I have patience in SPADES when the subject is interesting, but Kubo's story is incredibly clichéd, predictable and boring. I felt like I was constantly waiting for the plot to pick up and for things to be explained or implied, and being ultimately unsatisfied. It was a very shallow plot with shallow characters. Overall, the plot feels like a bunch of half-baked ideas stitched together. They work as separate concepts, but altogether they don't relate to or complement each other, or give explanation, or often even make sense. Why was Kubo's father turned into a giant beetle rather than killed or turned into something less threatening like... a small beetle? Why is Kubo's mother so sick or mentally scarred in the beginning, but only sometimes? Don't ask questions. Clearly the writers didn't. (Many other users have left reviews pointing out minor, but ultimately compounding questions they had about the story. It's almost shocking how much of the plot is logically inconsistent.) There are twists in the film, but if you're remotely familiar with movies in general, you'll probably figure them out at least 40 minutes before they're revealed.I can go on. There's a lot wrong with the movie, but overall, it can be encapsulated with ""boring and predictable, yet somehow a bit confusing"". Clearly some people enjoy it, but I just found it disappointing. Some people might find the animation worth the watch, but while impressive, I didn't find it particularly visually interesting.Instead I'd recommend watching a Studio Ghibli fantasy film, such as Spirited Away or The Tale of Princess Kaguya. If you're into video games, play Okami. All of these take Japanese mythological ideas and work them into much more entertaining results, even if you aren't incredibly familiar with the source material. If you're looking for stop-motion animation, I'd greatly recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox, and Laika's previous exploits of Coraline and Paranorman."

I have four boys (currently 9, 7, 4, and 2) and we decided to watch this movie for our ""movie night"" our youngest fell asleep pretty early but that was fine. This movie held the attention of all of us for the duration of the movie, my 4 yr old said ""it was a little scary, but I liked it"" my 7 year old says ""it was good, it actually was good"" and our oldest said ""IT WAS AWESOME!!!!"" This movie will definitely be one that we as a family will enjoy again and again. For me personally it was fun listening to all the voices and figuring out who it was doing the voice."

You would think that a theme as old as humanity itself would get tired and played out, you would think that but it is not the case. To be hunted from birth creates a character that is jaded, feral and stubborn but Kubo is none of these. He is soft-spoken, kind, and true, a storyteller with a propensity for love that knows no limits. He is stronger than a brain.Though writers over time have produced lazy approaches to the idea of duality. Those who have created this incredible stop motion picture focused less on the details and more on the emotions that build from the theme of life and death.Happiness is a shroud donned by the reaper of souls.The end will make you see light in the shadows."

Let's begin:Kubo and the Two Strings is a 2016 Stop-Motion animated movie by Laika Entertainment. It's about an incredibly gifted little kid named Kubo who has exceptional music and storytelling skills. I watched it a couple days ago at my house and absolutely loved it! The animation is stunning and the voice acting is stellar. It features the voice talents of Matthew Maconahey (I don't know how to spell his last name, don't judge me) among others (I can't think of anybody else, don't judge me). I could've sworn the Monkey was voiced by Scarlett Johansson, but I guess I'm wrong. Oh, well. I'll live. Forwarning: I'm not good at writing reviews.The story is original and is beautifully told. There's funny moments, heartwarming moments, everything you could want! I'm a sucker for Stop- Motion, and this is one of the best ones I've seen! If you haven't seen Kubo yet, please, please do! I highly recommend it!Nine out of Ten!"
" If you must blink, do it now
",0.0,0.9685,2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,"In one of the most ""meta"" cinematic confessions of the last years since Kylo Ren being embarrassed by his inability to live up to Darth Vader in Episode VII, young wizard/storyteller Kubo (Art Parkinson), the titular protagonist here, sheepishly admits he isn't very good with endings.This stop-motion fantasy adventure by Laika (Coraline, ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls) has many successful elements: likable characters, strong voice acting (Charlize Theron in particular is great as a talking animal companion), enough original spins to make the classic hero's journey feel fresh ... and it looks phenomenal. Kubo bristles with visual details - it's one of the most gorgeous animated movies I've watched in years.Spoilers aside, Kubo starts with an effective first act, builds up to a powerful crescendo... then sort of peters out at the end. Characters we've grown attached to get kicked off the spotlight by the main villain, who had been conspicuously absent until then. It's not a *bad* conclusion - it has a nice bittersweet flavor - but it's anticlimactic. It's the opposite of ParaNorman, which was droll but unremarkable for most of its running time but knocked it out of the park in the final act.Overall, Laika's winning streak continues. Much like Coraline, however, this isn't fit for younger children - if you want a fine stop-motion adventure for little kids, go for the Shaun the Sheep movie.7.5/10"
" An experience that is dazzling for kids and adults
",0.0,0.9986,2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"We have all had the experience of watching animated movies. If it's a Disney movie you go in with high hopes knowing you will be enchanted and dazzled with superb music scores written by the very best. If it's a Dream-works movie you know it's a bit of a risk, they made great movies like ""Kung Fu Panda"" or ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"", but then had some real stinkers like ""Home"" and their most recent blockbuster ""Trolls"". Then you get movies like ""Kubo and The Two Strings"" which may be the riskiest experience. Coming from the company who made the superb ""Coraline"" and the thrilling ""Paranorman"" you'd think Kubo would be set up to be successful. My worry going in was that this movie wouldn't be able to find the balance of appealing to younger audiences or older audiences. But this movie did the exact opposite, in fact it excelled, anyone who watches this movie will discover a new favorite experience. ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" follows the journey of Kubo, played by Art Parkinson (the Walking Dead) who has a mysterious skill that he inherited from his mother. After a hard loss, Kubo meets a monkey named monkey, played by Charlize Theron (Mad Max: Fury Road) and he meets a beetle, and you guessed it, he's named beetle, played by Matthew McConaughey (Interstellar and about half of all of the chick flicks ever made.) This cast is full of talent, and they give all of these clay created characters life. I like to compare this movie to a painting. Often, paintings start with an Idea (crazy, I know.) Then when you are writing out your idea, you have new ones. Somehow, artists know how to seamlessly weave all their dreams and hopes into art. Kubo, to the core, is a movie about a boy on a treasure hunt. There is so much more depth to it though. The first thing to mention is the visual effects. Already nominated for an Oscar, Kubo excels at making a new universe from the little that we see. Second, is the score. Much of this movie's soundtrack is based off the song ""While my guitar gently weeps."" I love seeing how movie's, this one especially, can stretch and bend an original song. If they want a scene to be intense they can add more strings and increase the speed, in contrast, when they want a emotional scene (which they do, a lot) they slow down the music's tempo appropriately, so that your feel goods can feel good. Kubo is one of the best movies of the year. It makes you feel things that have probably been dormant inside of you. If you want to cry, laugh, smile, and leave happy, you should at least give ""Kubo and The Two Strings"" a chance."

This animated film is amazing for several different factors but mostly for it's background story that most of people that give bad review fail to understand. The story reflects upon the mistakes we do in life, the important impact they have on others and how life changing forgiveness can be. Kubo and his mother, escape from his mother's cruel family that cursed her for marrying a mortal man. Kubo's grandfather, a once man that turned into evil, took Kubo's eye in order to make him blind into people hearts and memories. While they think they are safe, their evil family gets back on their tracks and the only way for Kubo to be safe is to locate a three piece invincible armor. The story is truly a tenfold into Japanese folklore and the way Kubo uses his narrating powers through origami is fantastically beautiful. There isn't really one single thing i did not like about the film. And the Japanese rendition of 'My guitar gently weeps' at the ending titles was a huge cherry on top of a delicious cake. 10 thumbs up."
" Laika Deserves the Oscar This Year
",0.0,0.9946,2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"I can't tell you how happy I am after watching Laika's latest offering- Kubo and the Two Strings. It is without an iota of doubt, one of the best films of 2016. Laika has come a far way since Coraline. Despite having difficulties in turning their movies into profits, Laika is still around and making films. This is good because there are very few people who still work with stop-motion. It's very tough to make a stop motion film as it requires patience and hard-work. Most of the studios do not bother about it as they have CGI to do their job. As a result, stop-motion is almost non-existent.Laika is different though. With Kubo and the Two Strings, they are trying to tell you that the art of stop-motion is not dead and they are the flag bearers when it comes to making such films. This film sets the bar for stop motion even higher. It feels like a CG animated film. So much hard-work has gone into making this film. Lets talk about the film now.First of all, I would say that this film is more suitable for adults (like most of Laika's films) than children. Children may get scared because some of the parts are very dark and scary. In fact, I got scared during many scenes. The film begins with the following lines. ""If you must blink, do it now. Pay careful attention to everything you see and hear, no matter how unusual it may seem. And please be warned. If you fidget, if you look away, if you forget any part of what I tell you, even for an instant, then our hero will surely perish"" The opening lines are enough to give you a hint of what's coming. It sets the dark tone of the film. As if these lines were not enough to chill you to the bones, the film starts with a night sky, a full moon, thunderstorms, heavy rains and a tumultuous sea. In the midst of all this, we see a woman on a boat trying to cross the sea and take her infant to safety. She uses the magic to defeat the waves but gets hit on the head by a rock. She is swept off to the sand and we get to see a glimpse of the infant (Kubo).Fast forward a few years and we see that Kubo has grown up and takes care of his mother who is not well. He lives in a village and earns the bread by performing with his magical origami and instrument. One day, he accidentally summons two spirits from the past. These spirits are of his aunts from his mother's side. Now, I must warn you that these twisted sisters are the scariest part of the film. When an animated film is able to scare you, you know the animator has done a great job. To defeat the spirits, Kubo must find three things. The rest of the film is about that. But there is much more than just thatKubo and the Two Strings works on many levels. It does lose some of the charm in the third act but the bucolic setting and dazzling animation make up for it. Honestly, I would have given it a solid 10 but the third act is a bit, lets just say – underwhelming. Overall, Kubo and the two strings is one of the best movies of the year. I seriously wish this film takes home the Best Animated Picture Oscar. It has got a great story, good voice acting and eye-popping animation. But I know, Zootopia will give it a very tough competition. No matter which film wins, I just hope Laika keeps doing what they do best- keep making such awesome flicks."

But you will know what the ""big reveal"" about every single one of these characters (which are all stock, BTW -- only the monkey ever proved even MILDLY amusing) the very second they are introduced.This movie, therefore, accomplishes the incredibly rare feat of relying on stupid random crap while still managing to be boring and predictable.So if not for this movie's ""plot"", the love for it must be due to its breathtaking stop motion animation, right? Well. . . Sure, I could believe that. Because the people at Laika have succeeded at pushing the limits of stop motion so far that it can easily be mistaken for CG.Really bad, really cheap, Norm of the North-like CG.Bottom line: Unless you're an art snob or keen on pretending to be one, this movie is not for you. It is stupid, dull and ugly to view, and ultimately will only suffice to make you angry at all the people who swore you needed to watch it."

So, i saw this with my mom and my brother, and i really enjoy it. This is by far the best Laika movie that i saw, twice. The writing of this movie is really brilliant and the dialog is mostly good or memorable. The characters are all likable and some of them are funny like the three main protagonists. The villains are most scary and interesting. The movie also has a lot of funny moments, especially with Beetle or Monkey. All the voice actors makes a great job even they aren't Chinese or Japanese people. Like Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey and Ralph Fiennes. The animation is fantastic, every detail or character design is just phenomenal. The score is also fantastic and the Japanese culture is fantastic and they don't modernize nothing. My only problem is the defeat of the villain, The King Moon. Which the scene i feel a little bit fast like Trumper's defeat of Shaun the Sheep Movie. I don't know if it was the writing or the edition, but it was something that i feel fast of that. But overall, Kubo and the Two Strings is a fantastic film.

It reminds me of artistic drawing style from ancient China I saw in art class, I believe it's also a classic Japanese painting style, since that's where the story begins.The way the art goes in this movie which is weird because of its unfamiliarity in today's animation trend, doesn't stop making this movie good, actually it's one of the special reasons that make this movie so special when I am now recalling the overall feeling it gave me. That feeling is what makes this movie so memorable to me. It's a story of a child, trapped in an unbreathable paper box, he is suffocating, but not give it up, he breaks out, and what he sees is the setting sun, the lightness gone... that's where the story ends Yes, an analogy of this movie, the tune Kubo And the Two Strings gave me from the start of watching to the end, when you break out of the box, fresh air breathed in, yet unable to keep your heart lightened.Depressed, because the darkness is almost coming, but not really, because you can still see the fading sunshine, so the guitar in your arms, still gently weeps...An amazing story, but in a sad way..."

The plot is not defined and the story failed to hold my interest. There are much unnecessary dialogue and scenes which don't add any value to the story. The most important thing is that the protagonist is out for its quest which is also not defined. I felt no empathy for the protagonist. Not a single character in this movie is well developed. There is no background story for them. Thus the purpose of the characters is unknown. As a viewer, I did not connect with the characters at all. The ending is also vague, and I doubt if kids will understand it at all. There is nothing good about the story.

The former has so far been winning the most awards, and will probably win the Oscar. But ""Kubo"" has a strong following, with some saying it is not only the best animated film, but one of the best films of the year in any genre.I love a good underdog, but in this case my sympathies lie with ""Zootopia"". The creators there have crafted an entire world, and it is not only very enjoyable, but lends itself to any number of sequels with other characters. It is a rich, dense landscape. ""Kubo"", on the other hand, is a very shallow, one-dimensional story. A boy goes looking for armor, and without even knowing what direction to go, he stumbles over it almost immediately. There is no deep conception of character or plot, everything just falls into place. For me, that really makes the film lacking and does not make me want to take repeat trips.However, ""Kubo"" is also nominated for Best Visual Effects. And on that note, I would love to see it win. I don't personally know the challenges of traditional animation versus computer animation versus stop motion. But, I do see the finished product here and how flawless it looks. Unlike the ""classic"" stop motion (such as ""King Kong""), the movements are seamless. I can't even fathom the amount of minuscule adjustments that have to be made.Although ""Zootopia"" is a clear favorite for Best Animated Feature (in my opinion), by all means give ""Kubo"" the Best Visual Effects and honor these folks for the hard work and countless hours it must have taken."

We are in a year where a stop motion movie is so delicious that I might even cry if it wins something cause it truly deserves.The plot is very very fun and adventurous, and Kubo is a great boy with a even greater mission...

" Skip Kubo and go straight to Kaguya
",0.2263,0.6855,2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"'Kubo and the Two Strings' is not a bad movie by any means. It is a fantasy adventure in a Japanese setting, the story of a boy who lost his father and is in danger of losing her mother as well, and has to go on a dangerous journey with a talking magic monkey and a giant beetle samurai. It is reminiscent of Narnia in many ways - talking animals, kid protagonist, quest for magical items, the story's allegorical nature.However American appropriation of Japanese culture never feels as true as the thing itself. The storyline of 'Kubo' has elements that reminded me of a Japanese animated film, 'The Tale of Princess Kaguya' (I won't tell you which elements because I don't want to spoil 'Kaguya' for anyone who hasn't seen it yet) and that movie is superior to this one in every way except that it doesn't have exciting swordfights. If you can handle mature, slower paced storytelling, I suggest you go straight to the source and watch 'Kaguya'.Still, 'Kubo' has its strengths. It's a humane story, and a sad one, and it has actually surprising plot twists. It is also well crafted - it's a stop-motion animation like 'Corpse Bride' or 'Coraline', and the movement of the dolls is so expertly created that it's a delight to see."
" Entrancing, aesthetic, and noble, some small issues poke through.
",0.4588,0.9978,2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"Welcome to the feudal era of Japanese folklore: a world of samurai, 'yokai' demons, spirits, and music that can summon magic.The premise is familiar, a grand quest for magic objects, but not the kind that can 'save the planet' or some other hyperbolic function. These are magic objects that are of personal importance to our protagonist. It is decisions like this that are much of what make Kubo an honourable movie. It doesn't resort to gross exaggeration of any kind simply to make it more kid friendly. There is humour to be found but it is strictly, and appropriately refined.Without being anime, Kuno maintains much of what makes Japan beautiful as depicted by its animation industry. Above all else, the masterful crafting of evening sunlight which is almost a Japanese signature is ever present in Kubo. Lighting is a compliment to what may be the films strongest aspect, which is its landscape. From the size of a tidal wave to the vibrant colour of a maple leaf, much of Kubo looks lifted out of a Hokusai print.Kubo dips into swordplay on occasion but when it does, it honours another, more questionable Japanese tradition. If you are an anime connoisseur, you will most certain appreciate the feeling of displacement from watching the expository and even intelligent conversations that characters too often have when in mid duel. Kubo does not quite rise above this, and uses its action scenes as places for the antagonists to explain themselves. And yet for all the dialogue in these scenes, the biggest conundrum of Kubo, is that the 'bad guys' motives never actually seem clear. As for Kubo himself, a pre-pubescent minstrel who tells storys with his shamisen and magic origami (flying paper animals) he is everything that the movie needs from such a character. He is a child with an adult brain. The story doesn't ask anything of him that is beyond our ability to swallow, until the climax which renders him in a suit of armour.The character undergoes his journey in search of what will allow him a life of peace. He comes out at the end, a little stronger much not drastically different from what he was at the beginning. The ending is strong however because it is small, and reminds us more about what has been lost then gained. I encourage Kubo as a family movie, not because it is more entertaining than most but because it is smarter and better made."
" I thought it was better than Zootopia
",0.4404,0.996,2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS is the fourth film from the production company Laika, the same team that released movies like ParaNorman and Coraline. Based on that resume, one would expect Kubo to be a dark and eerie storie full of strange visuals, and you would be right in that assumption. The key difference one might find is that this is more so a story about a family. It's sad they didn't get it quite right.There is some controversy surrounding the casting of an all-white cast to play Asian characters, but we can look past that. The story is a fairytale of sorts about a little boy who washes ashore as a baby with his mother. In her possession is little more than a shamisen (the Japanese equivalent of a banjo). Kubo grows and raises his mother (who is lost in a haze of confusion and distance) and earns his keep by using his mother's magical instrument to perform origami shows in the nearby village. He has heard stories about his now deceased father and how he was a great warrior. Like all kid heroes, he dreams of one day living up to his memory.We learn that it was his two aunts and grandfather that ultimately killed Kubo's father (kind of heavy for a children's movie, I admit) and that in order to prevent them from killing Kubo, he must remain hidden from the sky when the sun is down. I'm sure you can guess what happens next.The visual tapestries that weave together the story are simply remarkable, and the look of this movie will be unlike anything you have seen in quite a while. At times it became mirky whether or not I was looking at stop-motion animation or computer imagery, but the blurring of these lines worked in harmony to make a movie that would surely suffer had it been strictly one medium or the other. This is a movie that would be equally as stunning (if not more so) while watched with the volume off, allowing you to get lost in the framing of shots or the colors on screen.The film's absolute first lines are spoken by Kubo: ""If you must blink, do it now."" I had hoped this was a sign of a wonderful film to come, and by all means I tried my hardest throughout the screening to drink in as much of the film as possible. What was disappointing was the rest of the movie, the aspects of characters and plot that felt both boring and clichéd. Kubo finds himself alone and tasked with finding a suit of armor to defeat the final villain (you guessed it, his grandfather). He must procure a sword, a helmet, and a breastplate. Along the way, he makes friends with a beetle-man (quite literally a cursed man stuck in an in-between state) and a monkey that was once a charm Kubo kept in his pocket. Like The Wizard of Oz and all the other films like it, we know the hero must adopt some friends for his travel. The unfortunate part is that these characters just don't gel as a group and are reduced to simple comic punchlines to keep children entertained (I assume). Where the movie started out with a mature and brilliant setup, the back half of the story was simply a different, less sophisticated tone. There is also a significant twist near the end of the film that puts these two characters in a new light. The sad part is that the filmmakers didn't work to set them up properly or structure any sort of meaningful payoff. We find out this detail and simply go ""what?""Compared to other animated films this year (Finding Dory, Zootopia) I will still tip the hat to Kubo, a wholly original concept with a remarkable look. In a time when movies are nearly 100% sequels or reboots or any combination there of, Kubo is a unique movie that I know the general moviegoer will enjoy and children will find thrilling. It's not a bad movie by any means. I only wished it could have been that much better."
" Great Movie, disappointing ending
",0.2263,0.9492,2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"I think this is one of the best animated movies I have watched. I love the plot and the animation. My score showcases my disappointment with the final battle. Kubo spends the whole movie trying to find the pieces of the armor, but when he obtains them, they are not useful at all. The armors do not do anything special, and the grandpa can get the armor off from Kubo easily. I expected the armor to give more magical powers to Kubo so that he could become as strong as his grandfather, but it was not the case.I think Kubo's mother sisters were more powerful and provided a better fight than the grandpa. The grandfather was supposed to be the strongest, but he did not do much damage compared to his daughters."
" Absolutely wonderful
",0.6115,0.7319,2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"First off, I'm amazed this is stop motion. I actually had no idea when I was watching it until the credits, where they show it off a little. (Apparently, they used 3D printers and other software to achieve this level of stop motion animation.) I'm in awe.But of course it's not the technical achievement that makes a movie. What makes a movie like this is the gorgeous visual appeal, the terrific acting (especially by Charlize Theron), the touching, engaging screenplay, the characters, and the sense of magic appearing before us.This is at times quite dark, although leavened with humor, but it manages to keep away from being depressing, giving a sense of wonder and possibility to even the most melancholy scenes.Anyway, terrific movie, you should watch it."
" killer combo; studio LAIKA + Charlize Theron
",-0.6486,0.9839,2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"Reviewers Notes; 1. As I write this, the top-rated IMDb review starts with the header ""a hard movie to explain..."" and that pretty much nails it. The film starts very slow, builds gradually, has the viewer hooked like a fish by the mid-point, and then falls a tiny bit short in the climax. But overall the experience is unforgettable, magical, and great fun.2. In Japan anime, they revere not only their movies but their studios. It was always considered that the NA studios, even Pixar, don't measure up. But Studio Laiko in this amazing film has done things with stop-motion and color which make it a world standard and as good as or better than the best that Japan has to offer. I am even going to use some frames a screen saver, they are THAT good.3. Lots of great voice acting but Charlize Theron steals, literally steals, the film and takes it to a new level. Makes you forget all about the goldfish that initially started the trend in ""star"" voices. Truly an incredible performance."
" Underrated film GO SEE IT
",0.0,0.9457,2017-01-20 00:00:00,10,"This is the 4th film from the company that brought us Coraline, the Boxtrolls, and ParaNorman. Claymation is an underrated art and under-appreciated art. I feel like the general audience aren't interested in this art and that's sad. This film is AMAZING. This is a story about a kid named Kubo who is living in hiding from his family because they want to turn Kubo blind. Kubo goes on an adventure with his magical powers and his companions to obtain items to defeat his family once and for all. This film does a great job on portraying the Japanese culture which allows us to connect to the characters with our own family morals. The music in the film works well and the themes of the film Hit Home! This is truly an amazing film and if you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor and do so and you may need tissues. I give Kubo a 9.6/10. This was hands down my favorite animated film of 2016."
" The craft on display here is staggering
",0.0,0.977,2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"The word beautiful comes to mind when I think of ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", not just in the animation but also the story. Laika Entertainment has that art style that took me a little bit to get used to (the characters have a wood-carved look that I'm never really grabbed me) and I think that's worth mentioning because there's plenty here to help overcome that. Just the imagery of an origami Samurai shows off the incredible action staging and sense of movement (seriously, you don't expect to be so charmed by a paper swordsman, but that happens here).But it's also a tale steeped in Japanese folklore and full of family secrets and narrative twists. This plays on pretty much every emotion; and it's easy to write that off as callous manipulation, but there is some serious heart to this movie. 8/10"
" A good animation, uses Stop-Motion amazing
",0.7717,0.9897,2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Kubo and the Two Strings is a very well done animation, it uses Stop- Motion very well, it's impressive some scenes, the soundtrack is very good, the characters are good, but I do not find them memorable, the cast that makes the voice Of the characters is excellent, Charlize Theron, Art Parkinson, Ralph Phiennes, Rooney Mara, Matthew McConaughey, George Takei, and etc, all do a great job, have great times, good dialogues, the script is good, Kubo and the Two Strings is a good movie, even though it is not the best animation of the film. Year in my opinion, deserves at least an indication to Oscar of better animation. Note 7.8"
" Kubos! This Animation's Got Strings
",0.0,0.9993,2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Kevinyou're two-for-two with SOLID back-to-back best of the year film choices that most haven't even seen, or even heard of. But, I blindly take your word for it and haven't been let down.Let's just begin with: Kubo and the Two Strings BETTER win the Oscar for Best Animated category plus Best Song for ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps."" I wouldn't be opposed to this winning overall best picture, but we know they don't do that. Sadly.This movie was absolutely amazing. From story, to visuals, to creativity, to score, to (again) song, to jokesthis feels timeless and I just saw it for the first time. While the script and ideas aren't 100% fresh, it felt like a new breath of fresh air on an old fable. Basically, a single mother is rightfully overprotective of her child, Kubo, but he disobeys her and the dark forces she was trying to protect him from find them. In a story he thought he was either making up or retelling, he begins to live it in order to eventually confront his stalkers. I just gave the absolute gist of the story since it's best you just experience it for yourself. While the movie feels a tad Disney-inspired with some slapstick sidekicks, it makes it its own and correctly never lingers on the jokes that truly made me laugh out loud more than a few times. It knew it wasn't another company's and kept to the universe it beautifully created.While it's out there – I'm guessing this is a Studio Laika trademark since this is only my third film I've seen of theirs – it stays enough grounded for viewers to understand the film's mystical realm and rules. And while some themes are a little more adult and others dark, it's good enough for kids, just not too young. Adults, like myself, can marvel at a movie that we would've loved as a kid.It's certainly a movie not to be missed, especially for its fun adventure, comedic timing/lines and story beyond just animation. Relive your childhood here and take a wild trip in one of the best movies of the year.***Final thoughts: Kevin, I mentioned above, announces his top three best of the year on his final ""Fat Guys at the Movies"" podcast/radio show of the year. And each year I immediately go to that movie I've either heard about, but haven't seen or see it completely cold just because of his recommendation. In the past two years, he's been spot on: 2015's incredible Sicario and now, 2016's Kubo and the Two Strings. Both completely worth checking out, much like Kevin's awesome podcast. Look for his show online and you won't be disappointed either."
" Beautiful kids movie
",0.5994,0.9398,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,Kubo has amazing presentation of a kids story. It's very clear on this right from the start. Our narrator is untrustworthy drawing inspiration from the many tales he's been told. You will know 90% of the story before the halfway mark. But the journey is the fun part.Kubo is very direct in it's symbolism. TheJapanese mother who tells stories of the western inspired father. The story of how he took her from here father who was blind to the world. But through the combination of western and Japanese art the her father is able to see the world. But only once the smoke of fear cast by the selfish daughters is cleared.That's about the deepest and least direct symbolism I got out the movie. Everything else is spelled out for the kids to understand. The monkey and beetle being the father and mother was told to you in case you didn't notice the major gifts from the mother and father being a monkey statue and a robe with a beetle on it.The character development is also lacking. Everyone has one motivation that isn't supported by much more than that's what they exist for.Kubo reminds me a lot of Life of Pi. Great presentation with very direct explanation of symbolism. If it left more up to the audience to notice I would give it another star and if it had a tiny bit more character development it would be a perfect score.
" Shamisen shaman and a story about the power of story-telling
",0.0,0.976,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Saw this a while ago with my boys and their 8th grade friends. Probably the last ""kids"" movie we will see, but a word about that.I wonder if any younger kids might have trouble with this, not necessarily the scary perils of the adventure, although definitely many very young kids would find that frightening. But the air of morbidity, well that's a bit harsh, but a serious contemplation of death might be a bit tricky. It's not Jack Skellington at play here, or any of the cute aspects that Tim Burdon and others can make into plush toys. It feels more philosophical, so I wonder if younger kids (elementary school) might find it sailing by them.At the same time, the animation is fantastic and the music even better. Plus there's plenty of comedic relief channeled through some character incarnations. I'm just not sure if younger kids will appreciate a story about the power of story-telling.Ah, maybe I'm short-changing the short-stuffs out there. I would say for my non-breeder friends, this is certainly not (just?) a kid's movie.As for the darker side of the dark side, I wonder if any parents took their kids to this film to help subconsciously wage war with interfering in-laws (grandpa and two aunts are enemies)."
" Overrated
",0.0,0.9885,2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"I had high expectations for this film with all the praise it got but in the end, it fell short. Now, visually the film is gorgeous and the animation is top-notch, if you were to judge the film by those aspects, it's easily 8-9 out of 10, but there's the plot unfortunately which is just as important and happens to be paper-thin in this film. The set up for the story is extremely cliché just like many other things along with bland, poorly explained origin. And for an adventure movie, there really isn't much of it there. Let me elaborate, the main character needs to acquire 3 essential items to battle the evil forces but the angle is just so cheaply performed. They just battle a giant skeleton and then built a boat to get to their destination, that's it. And the final battle in the film just happens so arbitrarily as if the writers knew that there was nothing else to do and it's just as anticlimactic as the ending. Overall, it's safe to say that the movie was RUSHED it set up for more than it could depict. The supposed ""twist"" about Kubo's parents was extremely predictable and I don't know if it was intentional or not, but it was extremely easy to figure out right from the start of the journey. My main problem still happens to be with the movie's poorly explained background but I don't think I can elaborate on it without spoiling too much so I'll leave it at that. The main villain's motivations are pretty unconvincing and extremely shallow. Now, for the good part. Aside from excellent animation, the voice acting was really good and I enjoyed the character development as scarce as it was. But that's all there is to it. A paper-thin, uninteresting plot in a good format. 6/10 and that's generous."
" Gorgeous animation, dull story and a bit over-hyped
",0.3182,0.9759,2017-01-12 00:00:00,3,"Initially I had no intention of watching this movie as there was nothing really screaming ""you must watch this movie"" to me but I had it on while in college one day and I can definitely say it was maybe a bit too over-hyped. Now I will say the animation is stunning, seeing how they created and animated the giant monster they battle was amazing and aside from the character played by Matthew McConaughey who was quite funny the story fell flat and the characters weren't all that likable to me, Kubo came off as bratty and the monkey was just irritating. This movie is called the greatest animated movie of 2016 but I'm sorry to say I do prefer Zootropolis and Finding Dory over this one, they had deep emotional stories whereas I think of lot of people didn't make it past the animation aspect of Kubo which for me is the only reason the movie isn't scored lower."
" Not a fan of it, but still well made.
",0.289,-0.7615,2017-01-11 00:00:00,4,"Jesus Christ this is a boring movie. I could barely watch it, and I didn't like the story. I could tell that this movie was well made, but this still is a boring movie. In short, is this a good movie? Yes. Is it an exciting movie? Not in my opinion. Should you watch it? I would not suggest it, but then again I don't suggest drugs yet millions of people beg to differ. I can't believe how much money I spent on this movie, it was not worth it in my eyes. Also another thing to note is that my kids did not enjoy this movie either, and they have really low standards. Maybe I'm just being a bit nit picky because I am a movie critic and I have watched too many good movies to appreciate this. Or maybe it's just a boring movie. Yes, I know I am not a professional critic, just a critic in my small crappy town here in Aussie. Never visit Darwin Australia, terrible place."
" Great Stop-motion
",0.6249,0.9974,2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie is very well done in my opinion. First of all the combination of Stop-Motion and the regular animation was brilliant, was outstanding and very enjoyable to watch. Personally, I love this kinds of movies, but I am sure that even if you don't, you will enjoy this one. The casting was a very nice combination of actors. Screenplay was beautiful, it shows the values of family, also the customs and tradition in Japan; in involves action, love, comedy, sadness, fear, and fantasy (just the perfect combination). The dialogue was brilliant, a very developed one, told in a a sophisticated but at the same time in a humble way. The origami was magnificent, and a very beautiful and artistic way to tell stories. The whole story is very pretty. This movie is one of a kind. The director made a wonderful job, the characters of course and their own stories, makes you fall in love with it. Laika's animation was incredible! 9.0/10"
" This animation movie and I will forever be tied, together with the red string of fate. This film was very unique.
",0.0,0.9979,2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"From the studio that created stop-motion hits like 2012's 'ParaNorman', and 2014's 'The Boxtrolls' comes Laika's newest stop motion film set in Medieval Japan. Co-produced by Travis Knight in his directorial debut, this sweeping 3-D adventure epic tells the story of a magical boy named Kudo (Voiced by Art Parkinson), who must locate a magical suit of armor worn by his late father in order to defeat a vengeful spirit from the past, the Moon King (Voiced by Ralph Fiennes) with the help from his protectors, Monkey (Voiced by Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Voiced by Matthew McConaughey). Without spoiling the movie, too much, the film is very similar to Laika's previous works; it also has dark, twisted, and occasionally scary animation feel to it. So, it might not be, for everybody. However, I do believe that Laika engages its audiences both young and old, by how great, their animation was, during the action scenes. There's something noticeably satisfying about watching this movie in 3D. I love how every intentional facial adjustment and movement for each individual frame work so well. Everything looks so detailed and perfect with little to any blemishes. The technicalities, and effort put behind the film animation action scenes prove that stop-motion is still going strong, even today. While, the action is breathtaking, I think the movie does stumbles a bit in the story and pacing. Don't get me wrong, I was intrigued by Laika's approach to the ancient Japanese setting. I love all the foreshadowing & metaphors. Absolutely marvelous. However, the meat of the story was just a recycled plot from their earlier film, 2009's 'Coraline'; with the whole eerie, otherworldly beings who wishes to ""save"" children from a ""bleak reality"" by stealing their eyes. It was very noticeable. Another thing, wrong with the plot is how confusing, it is, even after heeding the warning in the beginning of the film, about paying close attention, or our hero will surely perish. I get the idea that it is trying to say with the eyes and keeping your memory, but a lot of the visuals, don't make any sense. A good example is the lake scene, where I thought Kubo's magical shamisen instrument was surely lost. However, it just appear, back in his hands, out of nowhere. It seem awkward, seeing how it effects the 3rd act. The same, goes with his family's long lost heirlooms 'McGuffin' whom only purpose, was to act for a treasure hunt. Other things that bug me, was the way, Kubo's mother, becomes alive at night, and braindead during the day, due to the head injury in the beginning. Clearly, that means, there was no time, for her to support Kubo. So, how was Kubo raise from a baby!? Wouldn't he, truly starve!? Maybe, I'm pulling on straws, here, but those questions do need to be addressed. Also, I think, the movie spoil, who monkey and Beetle really are, way too early in the film. Because of this, the ending revealed by the Moon King didn't have the punch as it should be. Still, these minor bumps can be easily overlooked. Yet, I can't say, the same with the voice acting. I found Charlize Theron to be very boring as Monkey. The way, she talks is very dry, as if reading off, a script. Matthew McConaughney's voice on the other hand, seem really out of place. Don't get me wrong, he really does bring a lot of needed humor to the mostly humorless film, but hearing his southern American accent in a film that supposed to be in Japan is jarring to listen to. In my opinion, I think more Japanese or Asians actors should had been used in the main roles. After all, there is Japanese actors like seasonal actors like Dean Cain and Masi Oka that really needs some more work. Regardless of the voice acting, the music feature in the film by composer, Dario Marianelli is powerful and compelling. The instrument is featured in Regina Spektor's cover of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" which plays over the end credits and is included on the film's soundtrack is also just as good. Overall: It wouldn't supposed me, if this movie wins a few 'Best Animated film' of the year, award. It really deserves, much of the praise, it has been getting. In the end, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' is a movie worth seeing. It's music to my ears."
" Enchanted Stories
",0.3818,0.9896,2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Visually spectacular, with original compositions and perfect visual effects, Kubo and the Two Strings has an interesting, symbolic, complex and almost gloomy plot that develops the script of a beautiful way, creating charismatic characters (in particular a truly hero, whose audience pray unconditionally) and an inspiring message (special in this days, when the art of the transmit tales are practically gone). The musical part and the voice overs are excellent, and the role develops in your and correct time. Incredibly and really emotional, with his good doses of humor, this movie fills the heart with much and several loves."
