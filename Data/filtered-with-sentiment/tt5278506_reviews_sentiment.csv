" Delightfully Weird Discovery
",0.4588,-0.252,2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,Watched this on a whim a while ago. Had no idea about this tickling subculture and was so surprised at the turn the documentary took. It was a bizarre and thoroughly enthralling watch.
" What is the hell is that am horrified

I can assure you that you are mistaken.
""But I now think this was never even about tickling... This is about power, control and harassment. It's about one person's twistedness, and how far that can go."""
" Weird and wonderful.
",0.4588,0.9888,2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"David Farrier is a kiwi icon, and I'm a kiwi so I love David Farrier. He's probably my favourite journalist, he always finds really wacky, unique stories. Tickled is possibly his weirdest, and it is absolutely his most dangerous story so far in his career. Dylan Reeve is also a pretty interesting and funny dude.I don't want to say much about the plot of tickled so I'll keep this part very brief, I think for the sake of my review I should give a little bit of context though.Tickled is basically about a tickling rig that hires young male athletes to be tied down and tickled by other young male athletes. At least that's what it starts out as. The story goes many places that you will not expect.What started out as a funny, weird story turned into a pretty sad character study of David D'Amato, a sad, obsessed, controlling, insecure man who clearly hasn't had the easiest life, even if he seems like it he's doing well on the surface. I'm not defending his actions. I feel I have to clarify that, what he did is disgusting and nobody deserves to be treated the way he treated hundreds of people. I've said too much already, so if that sounds remotely interesting you will love this documentary.The presentation is pretty unique and the way they shot scenes when there was no interview footage was really clever, it was always engaging even when nothing important is happening on screen. The soundtrack is also pretty brilliant, this was no surprise to me though, I knew a lot of the soundtrack was taken right from one of my favourite films of all time, upstream colour by Shane Carruth. The upstream colour soundtrack was used as sort of stand in music while tickled was being edited, they thought it worked well for the film. Someone who worked on tickled got in contact with Shane Carruth and they were allowed to use the soundtrack to his film.This is absolutely a must see documentary that I encourage everyone to watch. If you like this check out some of David Farrier's other work, he finds a lot of fascinating topics to make stuff about."
" Manipulative and self-indulgent, but scary and tense
",-0.8126,-0.6486,2020-10-03 00:00:00,7,"A film which brings you in under certain auspices and then completely flips your expectations. It leaves you feeling wildly upset about the world by the end, knowing that certain abusive things go on and that there seems to be little to be done to stop them."
" I'm glad this documentary exposed this person
",0.4019,-0.9223,2020-09-29 00:00:00,8,I'm so pissed that people with money and get away with breaking the law. How on earth can you get away with ruining people's lives?? I feel so bad for these people that have been effected by this one man!!! This man who needs to go to prison. He's been committing crimes left and right. How are you allowed to take out a credit card in a dead persons name??? I'm confused how he's getting away with this. I hope it catches up with him. There's a special place reserved for people like him. Same place my ex is going.
" Interesting documentary
",0.4019,0.4271,2020-09-10 00:00:00,9,Most reviewers are so harsh on the rating. The review is good but they're still giving it 5/6 stars.Anyway for me it was a mind blowing documentary as I didn't see the trailer and never expected what was about to happen.Really interesting and bizarre world exposed.
" Much more than what you'd expect
",0.0,0.9909,2020-09-04 00:00:00,7,"Tickled began with a simple idea. Some film-makers were exploring a fun story about the world of competitive tickling after seeing a couple videos on the internet. But this documentary is only partially about people being put in restraints and tickled until they can hardly stand it. The rabbit hole that these film-makers get sucked down is surprisingly deep, and absolutely thrilling. Faced with a great deal of opposition, it feels like every scene in Tickled requires the documentary team to take a risk. There are action movies that do less to excite me than this movie did by simply approaching some men to ask a few questions. Who would have thought that there was so much to learn about such a silly topic? The documentary team does some research, and helps fill in as many of the gaps in the story as possible. I was impressed by the fact that they were able to find some people to come forward with the truth, and also that they never shied away from confronting those involved.I think it's important to point out that all the videos that are shown in this film involve fully-clothed people (with the exception of some guys who have their shirts off.) While it might be a fetish for some, there's nothing overtly sexual in the content we are shown. That's what makes the entire story so fascinating, because it feels like a relatively harmless series of videos that may titillate someone, but shouldn't scandalize all the people involved. Yet there's a cover-up going on, and the joy of this documentary is getting to the bottom of it all. I was downright riveted by all the things we learned as this movie progressed, and I was desperate for more. In fact, I fear that's the one area where Tickled felt a bit lacking. The pay-off at the end felt like we had a few answers but no solutions. I understand it's not the role of documentarians to fix the world's problems, but I felt the film left me on an unsatisfactory cliffhanger. Tickled is still an excellent story, and it delivers more than you'd expect."

",0.0,0.8756,2020-06-25 00:00:00,7,"""Finally, when most of the lowdown is divulged, TICKLED ends with more reverberations when Farrier calls David's last relative alive, his stepmother, and we are apprised that David is not a bully in his childhood, instead, allegedly he is a bully victim, that, for this reviewer, is the manna from heaven, while most of us may concern about what damage those bullies can wreak when they grow up, the film intelligently reminds us that the same attention should also be applied to the victims, how their mentality can be forever impaired by the pernicious act and in turn, they comes off as a new bully when they are equipped with the wherewithals, that is food for thought from one side of the story.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
" Really Important Documentary (Despite the Subject Matter)
",0.2716,0.9633,2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I like all things Kiwi, so I was biased going into this one. Regardless, this one is important not because ""competitive endurance tickling"" is such a important issue or a noble cause by any means (haha), but that journalism can be such a powerful thing for lessening the power of bullies with a lot of money.This documentary was a keen reminder that not only will money give you legal immunity but it will also increase the means for a sadistic mind to royally mess with the lives of people.I'd watch it for shock value and an interesting story.I'd also watch it because it's a great reminder of how ""untouchable"" a lot of people really are in this world."
" this is not what you think
",0.0,0.8614,2020-05-12 00:00:00,10,"Excellent! I like the way documentary started you'd think what is this tickling documentary ?but nope ! it turns to something else! I'm glad they didn't give up and continue to make this documentary!!! if you like different, bizarre and twisted documentaries go head you should watch it!"
" Disturbing, gripping. Brilliantly made.
",0.1779,0.968,2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"IMDb has classified this as a documentary. For me, it felt like less of a documentary and more of a thriller, that too of the best quality.this is the best thing that I have seen since the lockdown began. it starts off in a very innocuous manner and then goes off in a completely different, deadly and dangerous tangent.it is bloody gripping. the best part is that the director has made in a very accessible manner. so that you don't really have to strain your brain in understanding what is happening on screen.the screenplay is mind blowing. This is one of those films that you would end up recommending to dozens of your near and dear ones and as I have written about a few films earlier this is meanr to improve your street cred among everyone who will end up seeing it.it is absolutely brilliant and I can't really can't recommend it highly enough."
" Bizarre, cruel and definitely worth the watch.
",-0.3612,0.0488,2019-09-24 00:00:00,10,"This is a film hard to review without spoiling, so I will restrain myself from saying anything with detail because there are things here that are better understood in context while watching the film rather than me giving away certain details..Immediately starting off expecting a satire of this tickling event, the film pulls the rug from under you making you think that you were going to watch a weird movie about this bizarre competition. However, you soon discover the dark and cynical side to all of this and it absolutely blew my mind. With each unravelling moment, your jaw will be on the floor to see the corruption and deceit that had been going around. With each interview, you feel the pain that these people had gone through and will sympathize for them because of what happened to them. None of these men who soon became casualties deserved everything that had happened to them. However, with some other people, you will loathe them based on their ideology and how people with power can be so corrupted.It's like how I felt when I was watching ""Spotlight"" where you respect the journalists that keep pushing to get the truth, no matter the amount of threats and harm that may come to them. These two journalists in this film kept on going and you simply have to admire all that they have done. They brought all of the tension and thrills necessary to keep this documentary interesting and they follow a story that seems so unreal that you'll be surprised that it actually happened. Providing proper research and dedication, this documentary easily became one of the best documentaries I've seen. This may not suit everyone's cup of tea, but it is still worth watching to see that truth can be more bizarre than fiction and to see the amount of obstacles these men had to go through to get this movie out there.Also, I recommend watching the short film ""The Tickle King"" as it continues from after the premier and brings in the same tension that you will see in this film."
" Filmmakers were brave/RIP Jordan
",0.0,-0.928,2019-09-23 00:00:00,9,"I had stumbled upon the videos myself. Years before the movie came out. Mostly the audition tapes. The guys were about my age. Specifically the ones with the MMA fighters. I did notice as the audition tapes came out Jordan Schillaci became less enthusiastic about the process. That wasn't anything that seemed like a red flag though. I thought it was acting. It seemed like a bunch of young adults having fun in their spare time. I was very upset to learn some peoples lives were ruined by the whole experience. It didn't seem like anything bad to me. Just some guys who were barely out of their childhood years enjoying tickle sessions. I saw it as childish fun, not anything sexual. I'm glad the filmmakers helped put a stop to David D'Amato and his harassment, when he was alive.I know Jordan recanted some of his statements, but he seems terrified in those interviews with people from D'Amato's team. I recently found out Jordan died back in August (2019). I didn't know him, but it still broke my heart. His personality in the clips could pull people in, and his MMA fight clips are cool. RIP Jordan Schillaci."
" Terrific
",0.4767,0.7879,2018-10-15 00:00:00,10,"Yes, terrific, outstanding, because so weird, disturbing and real in the same time. The other users have told about told it far better than I will ever do. But no, I have never seen such topic about such a matter. They talk about tickling as if it was a Secret Defense issue, involving the National Security files. Or the Mafia, criminal nets...And the best is in the end, where everything is finally explained. On the phone, the step mother of the man guilty of all this explains, gives détails about the genesis of this behaviour. That's the best for me. 
I still can't believe it. 
Thanks Netflix for this gem."
" Why people on power wants to keep it no matter what?
",-0.2732,0.631,2018-09-20 00:00:00,6,"Impunity, might be the answer. And yeah, you could end with that conclusion by other means, but that's exactly what I was thinking when I watch this docThis probably isn't an elite doc, and yet, they really get you inside their experience uncovering one man's fetishes and his desire to keep them in the dark, and to what extent he would go to keep it that way."
" Interesting.

On a technical level, this is well put-together with some stellar cinematography, and some great music."
" Takes a surprising turn
",0.2732,-0.7096,2018-03-11 00:00:00,9,"Tickled is a captivating documentary that begins with a reporter's attempt to interview those behind an internet-based company that produces ""competitive endurance tickling"" videos. Taking surprising turns, Tickled reveals a dark story of one man's 30 year obsession with athletic young men who are lured into performing for money and gifts, only to become harassed and exploited when they no longer want to be involved with the ""sport"". Ultimately, this is a revealing expose of David D'Amato's psychological issues and his desire to exert control over the lives of the young men who he ensnared (Klaus Ming June 2017)."
" Tickled: Certainly more than meets the eye
",0.34,0.9669,2017-08-05 00:00:00,6,"Tickled is such a weird creature, a documentary about the ""Sport"" of competitive endurance tickling. Yep, you read that right.However that is merely the beginning, as the documentary delves deeper it gets dark. Really, really dark.Not to ruin anything but there is so much more and the subject matter is remarkable, trouble is its ruined by a very lackluster near spineless documentary filmmaker who squanders the potential.Within moments I felt like I was watching another scripted documentary alike Catfish (2010) the concept was too fantastical and everything just felt too convenient.However upon investigation it certainly appears to be legitimate and once you've watched the documentary you'll realise that is a really scary fact.Well made and truly fascinating subject matter but handled by people who were just out of their depth.We can only dream what could have been! Do hope this doesn't develop a TV show like Catfish otherwise my spidey sense will start tingling again."
" A compelling investigation that doesn't quite maximize the documentary feature format
",0.2263,0.9164,2017-06-28 00:00:00,6,"Some of the best documentaries start out seeming to be about one subject and turn out to be about something totally different. That is definitely the central tactic of ""Tickled,"" a movie that suggests a deep dive into the bizarre world of ""competitive tickling"" but surfaces as a film exposing one person's manipulative use of power and money.New Zealand journalist David Farrier and filmmaker Dylan Reeve knew they were on to something big when Farrier started to face threats and fierce legal resistance to his investigation of online tickling videos posted by a company named Jane O'Brien Media. They uncover a rather fascinating story, but whether the fish they caught is ""feature documentary big"" is the larger question that follows this movie around like a shadow.Bringing to light that some people have tickling fetishes certainly doesn't merit a 90-minute film, so the story Farrier and Reeve uncover has to be worthy of that time. To that end, you could make the case either way. Their investigation of the mysterious entity of Jane O'Brien Media is the bulk of the film's action, and they carefully unfurl the story, detail by important detail, to maximize tension. Some of these details seem obvious, making their deliberate withholding of information or of their key sources a little more gimmicky than journalistic.The story develops legs when we meet some of the young men who have been victimized by this company. Jane O'Brien Media deliberately seeks out young athletic men who will be incentivized by money; the problem is that when any of this ""talent"" tries to back out, the company uses the videos to ruin the young men's online reputations, i.e. making these videos high in search results about them and plastering their name all over the internet with the videos. What's unsaid is the way this exploits the homoerotic nature of the tickling videos as leverage for extortion.""Tickled,"" however, focuses on finding out the truth about Jane O'Brien Media more so than the power of using the internet to manipulate people, or about how casting young men in a homosexual light can do incredible damage to their lives. These are issues that warrant exploration, but Farrier and Reeve mostly use them to add stakes and tone to their investigation.Investigative reporting is also not visually interesting, which ""Tickled"" struggles with. Too many shots show Farrier or other subjects/sources in the documentary sitting at a computer, or hands typing on a keyboard with voice-over. This is also the limitation of a story that lives almost exclusively in a digital realm. All of Farrier's brazen attempts to confront the people he needs answers from seem like courageous, bold actions taken in the name of truth, but the flipside of that coin is that his documentary would be nothing without them. There's no action in this film without him taking it.A major newspaper report or a long ""60 Minutes"" segment would seem most appropriate for ""Tickled."" As fascinating as the truth they discover and the portrait they paint of the individual behind all this are, the documentary feature format feels like an exhaustive means of telling the story. Farrier and Reeve also ignore the most interesting questions in favor of the mystery narrative, though some of Farrier's voice- over toward the end reveals their awareness of these bigger issues. There's one attempt to tie together the film's main topics of tickling and a controlling, abusive individual, but it requires overt explanation, and when that occurs, you know a documentary has become a little too splintered.""Tickled"" tells a story absolutely worth hearing and raises important questions, but because its tellers discovered themselves in the middle of that story, they weren't quite able to see the big picture and tell that story in a way most fitting for the big screen and that best tackled the issues at its core.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" 1-or-a-kind cross between documentary and investigative journalism
",0.0,0.8604,2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"Such an amazing film that I prefer to sketch out the broader points in note form: 1. The story is well known. Obscure N.Z. reporter with limited funds stumbles across an odd story on social media, tries to investigate it, and in no time at all 3 ""thugs"" cross the ocean from the U.S. to intimidate him. Digging deeper, he discovers what APPEARS TO BE a lone sociopath with millions of inherited family money who has, just like a Bond villain, established a global network of ""tickling"" studios, not necessarily for the money but seemingly to satisfy odd personal desires. A pattern emerges suggesting that this individual has a multi-decade ""pattern"" of the most astonishing personal attacks (including identity theft and other federal crimes) against anyone anywhere who gets in his way. Yet (and this is never properly explained in the film) somehow manages to bend even the Justice system to his will.2. So how does the film-maker respond? By crowdfunding a documentary and then tracking down the arch-villain. (The film is really a cross between a true documentary and an investigative journalism piece, which is quite rare.) 3. That's all the spoilers for the story. The raw power of the doc, however, lies in its ability to tease the viewer's imagination about what lies at the end of the breadcrumb trail. By the time you meet the nemesis (who in fact passed away shortly after the premier) the viewer has already formed a ""mental picture"" of what he will be like. That's the real power and magic of the story.4. Possibly one of the greatest docs of all time, even has its own sequel. Highly recommended."
" not the greatest filmmaking, but the subject matter and the journey trumps all
",-0.2579,0.4566,2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"As with The Jinx, a simple take-away is this: you get someone who has a *lot* of personal identity issues and a *lot* of New York family money, and it makes for a ridiculously dangerous combination - emphasis on both ridiculous and dangerous.This was riveting material as a mystery-unfolds story, though the filmmaking is fairly standard as an expose (you can't help but feel suspense for the directors as they have to do literal stake-outs outside of places like the 'Tickle' video building, where as if out of the Joker's hide-out you can hear the barbaric sounds of laughter wafting out of the windows, or when they wait for days to find the one car that belongs to the now-late David D'Amato). It gets stronger and more disturbing as it goes along as the directors discover more and more in places they weren't necessarily looking; at first they were simply looking into another tickling-fetish video company out of Orlando not related to the group that was trying to ""sue"" the filmmakers (in quotes as it turned out to be a bust). Then this leads from one person to another, and it turns out to be aliases and undercover identities, stolen social security numbers from dead people, and a figure who was once an assistant principal at a school.I thought at first this was going to all be some sort of goof, even into the first minute or so of the interview with the first ""tickled"" subject who agreed to talk on camera (face and all, not in the shadows or only just a voice or so on). What this so-called 'company' did is mortifying, and all for what is on one hand a seemingly innocent and on the other hand is disquieting; think about the times that you have, as a child, been tickled by your parents or tickle siblings or friends, and all in a having-fun sort of way. The manner in which some of these tickling videos were presented, one expects the Gimp from Pulp Fiction might appear to either tickle or be tickled.And yet people going into this doc should know it's not an exploration of ticklers like, say, Hot Girls Wanted where it's about the subjects in the videos. It touches somewhat on the fetish, but this, aside from some curious homosexual aspects (and I mean that not in any gross way, simply that it's interesting that it's all men and that David D'Amato is one of those highly ashamed gay men of wealth and prestige and projects that on to others), is more about the depths of WTF that go into this ""Tiffany Tickle"" or whatever her name was and how she is really this one man D'Amato.It's about power and control, and how it corrupts and makes humans into monsters, which slightly, thematically, connects back to how tickling in these videos is about submission and domination and being emasculated under intense pressure (again they're *all* young, well-built men in the videos, never women, never men older than, say, 24). In that way, Tickled can't help but hold out attention - not to mention a final, devastating phone conversation with D'Amato's step-mother."
" jaw dropping mystery
",0.0,0.9368,2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"Believe it or not, this documentary about competitive tickling unexpectedly became one of the most gripping and intense films of last year. This film brilliantly sets out to expose some of the most bizarre evils in our world, as journalist David Farrier explores a secret, shocking underground world after stumbling across a weird, silly tickling video online. What follows is a series of twists and turns that feel like a slightly surrealist film noir, but it's ALL REAL!Although it works mostly as a bizarre thriller, ""Tickled"" is also surprisingly comic and tragic. There is certainly much humor to be found in such a strange story, and David Farrier's narration and personality can be naturally funny. Throughout the first half of the film, many witty quips are made from his charming, New Zealander mouth, and it really eases the viewer before tying them up in the mind numbingly crazy mystery ahead. The tragedy plays an even more important role in the story, as the audience is told tales of fraud, abuse, and destruction that will genuinely shock almost anyone. And then, the final phone call scene is one of the most powerful moments in any documentary film that I have seen, as we learn a hidden backstory that, like everything else in the film, is quite unexpected.My eyes were glued to the screen, and my stomach was bursting with butterflies as I was engaged in the shocking mysteries this film exposes. It is easily one of the top 3-5 films of last year, and is a true masterpiece of the documentary. It is extremely underrated in my opinion, despite the fact that most people who've seen it seem to really like it, because it just flat out did not receive the wild attention I think it deserves. I encourage everyone to go out and see this movie as soon as possible, despite the fact that it did not even get an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary, which is absolutely ridiculous!"
" Amusing and disturbing at equal doses
",-0.1779,-0.991,2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"The story unveiled by Tickled is bizarre, is weird, is scary and even horrifying. It starts as one of Ferrier's usual researches for an odd story. He found an odd tickling sporting competition sponsored by an American company, contacted the company and the abuse and threats immediately began. Being bullied and threatened didn't stop Ferrier, on the contrary pushed Ferrier and his cameraman Reeve to pursue the story further. They ended unveiling why such an innocent thing as tickling has some people in the USA angry about being investigated, and whom these people exactly are. Tickled unveils a sub-world that is equally amusing, ridiculous and disturbing, and that tickling movies aren't such an innocent thing.This is an indie documentary, made with not many means, and therefore, even more valuable, as the bullying and pressure these guys had could not be counterbalanced with, say, the support of a news channel or a corporation. The investigation is well carried out, and they really dig deeper into the funny-not-so-funny world of tickling despite the pressure not to do so. The lack of means also shows in the form of shortcomings to carry out the research. I found a few things I thought deserved a different treatment or more research and digging. Firstly, these guys didn't take enough precautions to protect some of the confidants, those willing to speak about the bad guy off camera. If you record a conversation of a confidant who is scared of the bad guy and then reproduce the conversation on camera without voice distortion and without protecting the identity of that person, you are turning that person into a target. Besides, I would have loved more details about the nasty guy, especially about his work as educator in different schools and his life in jail. Why not interviewing some of his co-workers at the High Schools he worked? Was he weird? Did he show any odd behavior with youngsters? Was he a problematic person? Was he in good terms with other teachers? Also, this guy was tried and sent to jail in the past, so there must be a humongous amount of information about him in the lawsuit paperwork, and plenty of people he met in jail who might help provide a better profile of this disturbed dangerous guy.Overall, this is an amazing story, and a very interesting and entertaining documentary. In my case, I discovered that tickling is fetish, and that the guy behind the company is actually a mentally disturbed person with some sort of sexual dysfunction and denial of his own gayness and, most importantly a bully with tons of money, a teacher turned lawyer, a ruthless person who punishes anybody who doesn't do what he wants, by destroying their reputation and their lives.Kudos to Ferrier and Reeve for such a great investigation. I hope they are able to get more money so they can dig further, get proper legal protection, and offered more privacy to their confidants."

",0.6808,0.5505,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"And it isn't even a thriller. The tenseness I felt watching this movie is something I never felt before. This movie is a prime example of true investigative journalism, starting with something seemingly innocent and it ending up being one of the most disturbing things I have heard about. I believe this movie is a must see, even for people who do not like documentaries. Because this story could have easily been fictional. David does a great job letting you see this movie trough his eyes and trough they eyes of the people affected by it, I can only imagine the dread and fear he and they felt making this documentary. I liked that David left in his struggles while making this movie, even though the movie sometimes slowed down because of it, and that's my only critique. I have great respect for the fearlessness David and Dylan had making this movie, and for the people they managed to interview. Tickled is a crazy adventure about something I didn't know I wanted to know about. Its frightening, Interesting and sometimes a little silly. The title might seem funny, but believe me this movie is no joke."
" Investigative journalism at its finest
",0.0,-0.5961,2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Please don't read this review if you want to avoid a spoiler.Documentaries like this are what make Netflix more than worth the money. This is an interesting exposé of David D'Amato, an obese, troubled and wealthy American gay man who has built up what can only be described as an international tickling-porn exploitation ring. For many years, his network has found and paid indigent young men to do these videos.The videos are not done naked, so somehow this gay man has (with bizarre homophobic logic) convinced himself that it is not gay. If a young man crosses him at some point (e.g. by stopping), he retaliates by doxing and humiliating the hapless young man all over the internet and by sending revealing, hateful and lurid correspondence to everyone in the young man's life, including his parents, his employers, and so on.The porn producers and tickle-porn actors are understandably terrified of him. In carrying out these activities, he has (apparently and allegedly) committed several crimes, including identity theft, impersonating a lawyer, extortion, visa fraud and so on.Our stalwart filmmakers include David Farrier, a New Zealand reporter quite similar to Louis Theroux, who stumbles onto all this and documents what he finds. He faces a shitstorm of rather intimidating legal action from this guy and his minions. However, he pursues it diligently, and with one or two really lucky breaks he succeeds in exposing the whole exploitation ring to the world and identifying this horrible man.At some point, this movie changed direction: what happens when a lowly and unresourced investigative journalist, taking on the role that should really be carried out by police and prosecutors, decides to expose the malevolent and possibly criminal practices of a wealthy scumbag to the world? David and Dylan turn out to have huge balls, because once the sh*t starts flying they just go after him even more.It really is a remarkable movie and a decent bit of investigative journalism. We should support David Farrier and Dylan Reeve for their bravery and professionalism, as they battle lawsuits initiated by this nutcase even as you're reading this. Fortunately, HBO and Magnolia picked up the movie and hopefully made it worthwhile."
