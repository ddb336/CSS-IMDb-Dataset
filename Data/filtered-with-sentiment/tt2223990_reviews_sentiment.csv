" Ok until the end
",0.296,0.9128,2021-03-26 00:00:00,4,"It wasn't bad until the end when it got completely stupid. Costner tells the Jacksonville GM that there's always one GM who looks like a total jerk at the end of the draft. Yeah, up until that moment, Costner was that GM. Of course they couldn't make Costner look like a complete idiot so then they scramble around and make the movie even more stupid.Earlier Costner had traded Cleveland's next three first round draft picks in order to draft a guy they could have gotten with their original pick. Besides being beyond stupid, the point is that Seattle, with whom they made the trade, had obviously made the decision that this was better than drafting the QB they had originally planned to take with the first overall pick. So naturally at the end, Seattle trades the three picks, plus some guy named David Putney, back to Cleveland for the guy they had already decided wasn't worth drafting. And the best reason they can come up with is, oh well, because he wasn't the number one draft pick anymore he would be signed at a cheaper rate. Baloney.If Seattle wanted the quarterback so bad, why weren't they on the phone with Jacksonville, or vice/versa, trying to move up a slot? Instead Jacksonville trades that pick to Cleveland for three second round picks. Seattle could have traded two of the first round picks they got from Cleveland and both they and Jacksonville would have come out way ahead. Instead the only way to not make Costner look like the biggest idiot GM of the century was to come up with this completely contrived ending. I mean, ever heard of sign and trade? Jacksonville could have drafted the quarterback, then looked around to see who wanted him - oh, wait, Seattle would have wanted him. Or they could have just called Costner's bluff, why would he want this quarterback when Cleveland supposedly already had a good quarterback?Beyond that, what about this quarterback in question that everyone passed on? The whole message seems to be that he's arrogant so that of course he's going to be a bust. But not so fast. Based on Costner's shenanigans, what's makes it so certain that he is going to be a bust? No one questions his talent, and maybe this is just the lesson he needed to learn in order to make him a great quarterback, to learn some humility and be a team player. How about just the incentive he would now have to make every team, especially Cleveland, pay for the fact that they passed on him? What goes around, comes around. I would say even in this pathetic attempt to make Costner look like a genius, in a few years he would still look like the dumbest GM ever."
" Good fun

" Generous ad for pro football
",0.5106,0.959,2021-02-01 00:00:00,4,"I'll start by saying I like all kinds of movies, about all kinds of things. This is pretty much a great big advertisement for the NFL, with some Costner and Garner office romance thrown in. Of all the things to portray in human existence, the 'drama' of picking some overpaid boys play games is significant? Don't think so... Felt like just one big promo for modern gladiators."
" Thrilling movie
",0.4767,0.9986,2021-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Draft Day (2014)The 2014 film, Draft Day by Ivan Reitman is an overwhelming film with a lot of emotion that you can hardly believe is because of a day where a bunch of kid's dreams are coming true. Kevin Costner is a great fit for the role of Sonny Weaver Jr. His co-stars as well such as Chadwick Boseman playing Vontae Mack create some great moments between the characters in the film. On the opening weekend the film made over $9.5 million and is still a major hit today. Kevin Costner who has been in at least 64 movies, but the script for this movie was favourable and compelling in his mind. This quote explains it all, ""It compares really favorably, and that's why I did it. I do not go looking for these movies. They come across my desk and, a lot of times, they just are not any good. A lot of times, the work has not really been done. And I am not gonna do the work, in this case, unless I'm directing it. And this movie came very mature, and I was really surprised, and I felt like, Yeah I would want to make this a part of my filmography."" I think it would stand nicely alongside other movies I have done."" The director made the actors compel real life situations that can happen to NFL executives on Draft Day which helped the viewer better understand where all the raw emotion from this movie was coming from.
Draft Day is based on how an NFL Gm goes through his day on the day of the draft. All the meeting he has, phone calls he receives and gets, players he talks to. Its supposed to portray what the staff of a football team actually have to do and what goes behind picking a player. All the Gm's around the league are making their calls to try and take advantage of other Gm's and all these conversations create drama and affect how the draft unfolds right to the end of the movie. From being taken advantage of and pressure from outside sources, this movie is nothing but thrilling from the beginning. After Sonny Weaver Jr finds himself with a good draft pick the movie hits a point of no return once everyone in the movie is affected by it. After everyone calms down from the move that's been made, there is a ultimate decision on what they are going to do with it and who there are going. This movie has a lot of twists and turns with emotional connections being made and people going back and forth for a decision. This movie will leave you on the edge of your seat to find out what happens next.
Kevin Costner portrayed the role of Sonny weaver Jr perfectly. After production had meetings with people from the NFL to better understand the role of a Gm and how it operates, Costner portrayed it perfectly with his passion and heart he showed through the film. The realness of this film made it more compelling for the audience as they could relate it to real life. A star besides Costner that really made the movie was the role of Ali played by Jennifer Garner. With this being Garner's biggest production, she was apart of, she brings a powerful voice for a female role on a male sports team, intensity, and the way she can read peoples emotions to help them make the vest decisions for themselves and the team. She was nominated for some awards for playing this part which is amazing considering this was one of her first big roles in a movie.
The filming techniques used for this film were very real. The scenes that are most intense are filmed in the most intimate areas. The scenes where Costner and Garner are in remote areas where they are alone, and the music and lighting make ever more intimate and compelling. This real aspect brings the truth to this story that everyone appreciates. The panning gives us great angles that really help show the true emotion every character is feeling and every point in the movie, which is crucial to this film because there are so many things happening with each character. If you have not seen this film, you should take some time out of your day and give it a look."

" Mediocre And Underwhelming
",0.0,0.9583,2021-01-21 00:00:00,4,"There's been a number of films that take place over the course of a day and aim to give you the feel of what it's like to be there;Draft Day is about the first day of the NFL draft. And making such a film entertaining requires true talent on many levels. This film doesn't excel particularly in anyway. The writing isn't bad but yet it's not really anything to get excited about. Outside of Kevin Costner(who this film is nearly wholly focused on)there isn't any member of the cast who gives a noticeable performance. And the one person who could make or break this film,the director,fails.
Split screens was a gimmick that became popular in the 60's and should have been left to lay. However, they are constantly implemented in this film in increasingly obnoxious ways. This is just one very conspicuous example of this picture's shortcomings. It can also be noted that the entire situations that play out don't feel very realistic and the final outcome is underwhelming at the least and stupid at the worst.With a well contained runtime this film can be passable entertainment to NFL fans but overall it's not much to get excited about."
" Very poor
",-0.5256,0.9393,2021-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I didn't expect much but I got even less. The script sounds fake to the smaller detail. In the mind of the writers the dialogues are shrewd and intense like they were in Moneyball, but seem like they were pasted from an encyclopedia of clich√©s. Same for the jokes. You've heard those plastic lines 100 times before in your below average, late night watch. The ""love story"" was totally unnecessary. The acting is very lazy. The best thing was the aerial views on the Nfl stadiums."
" Great for football fans
",0.6249,0.9956,2020-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Sonny Weaver Jr. is the general manager of the Cleveland Browns and today is Draft Day and such a day is set on a grand stage. The teams owner seems to be at wits end with the teams commercial-ability and lack of winning lately and appears to be putting an immense amount of scrutiny on Sonny's every move. He needs to make a HUGE splash not only for the betterment of his franchise but for the security of his position. Sonny is left with a crucial decision, go for the gusto and draft the big name QB whose playing ability is celebrated everywhere he's been but has a high chance to bust or go back to the basics and draft the lower ranked linebacker with a muddled past but a pure love for the game that could be the framework of a well rounded powerhouse. To leave his current QB as an afterthought or to build off of the surprisingly solid culture the team already possesses. Sonny has always been backed into a corner of which the successful reputation his father garnered before him but now the choice is his and solely his despite the detesting nature of the owner and loud polarizing coach. Moves will be made and relationships tested to the max on Draft Day!I'll be 100% honest about this film, if you're not a football you won't like this clearly. Any Kevin Costner fan will be all for this one as he really is at his best in this film just proving that the man can excel no matter the plot or subject matter he just too good in my opinion."

I knew before 1/3 of the movie was through and while I stuck around to watch the rest of it, I didn't watch for the ending. I already knew what would happen.

Costner was fantastic in this role he was obviously made for and ably supported by many other great cast member performances. The story of the 2014 Nfl draft where he dares and risks his job to get the team he wants. Its an original film focusing on the final 14 hours leading upto the draft, the deals and backroom politics what takes place behind the scenes the loyal fans never see.

" A dramatic look into the NFL draft from the view of the Cleveland Browns GM
",0.0,0.9845,2020-04-30 00:00:00,7,"Draft Day is a sports movie that allows the viewer to get a ""behind the scenes"" look into the National Football League and its annual event of drafting college players into the NFL. While this film has elements of drama/ love story genre, it still is a sports film at heart.
We follow the day in the life of the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns Sonny Weaver (Played by Kevin Costner) on the day of the NFL draft. Throughout the film, you get insight into all the decisions, people, and outcomes that Sonny must consider while the future of the Cleveland Browns hangs in the balance. Do you take the risk of the player who has been in trouble while in college? Do you replace the aging but proven quarterback on your team for the hotshot college rookie? Do you go with a defensive player or focus on offense? It is during this roller coaster of a film that we delve into all these questions and more.
And don't worry if you are not a sports fan because there are elements of drama and sexual tension between the General Manager Sonny and his salary guru Ali (Played by Jennifer Garner). Not only that element, but you also have the proven Head Coach Penn (played by Denis Leary) clashing with the GM Sonny over which players they think is best. It gets so intense at one point that Coach Penn lights Sonny's desk on fire!
You may have seen other sports movies like Hoosiers, Bull Durham, or Field of Dreams, but the drama and storyline in this film have a completely different feel than those films had. One of the most enjoyable ways the director (Ivan Reitman) was able to capture the drama of the back and forth conversations on the phone between teams and players and even parents of players, was a unique fade in and out between the people involved in the discussions. It is a method that I have never seen in a film, and it really helped show the reactions on both ends of the calls.
If you are looking for a movie that has sports, love, and drama with an insider's look at the NFL, then you can check all those boxes with this great question of who would you pick for your team in the NFL draft?"

If I am going to watch a movie about football, this is my go to. As I truly believe it is the best football movie ever made. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor you won't regret it"
" Weak, run-of-the-mill, pandering, brand-friendly fodder
",-0.4404,0.7785,2020-04-18 00:00:00,3,"If we assume the money printers behind the NFL saw Moneyball and thought ""hey, we should totally do that too,"" this is almost precisely how I'd picture the end result. Polished and slick, loaded with team insignias and familiar Sunday morning fringe-dwellers, and superficially authentic at best. Behind the glamour is a hollow pantomime, stuffed with eyeball-rolling character moments and bland dialog, completely missing the points that made MLB's effort click. It does manage to get some things right - the frequent nods at league history are interesting, and the production values are dazzlingly first-rate - but it all feels so pre-approved and chest-puffing that I had a hard time buying it as more than just a long-form bit of promo fluffer. Kevin Costner, at his most washed-up and wooden, doesn't do anything to move the bar, and the climax may as well have flashed the words ""dynasty"" over the Cleveland skyline... subtlety is not its forte."
" Costner knows sports movies, and this is another enjoyable one
",0.4404,0.9941,2020-04-14 00:00:00,9,"I've been an avid fan of the NFL for most of my life, and find great joy whenever watching a game. However, I've never been one of those guys who follows the off-season stuff, especially the draft. Since I'm not a college sports fan, I don't know any of the players, so watching a draft feels pointless to me. As a result, I was not all that hopeful that Draft Day (the film) would click for me. The NFL draft has always seemed like such a dull process and I could not see how they would make an interesting movie out of it. I should have trusted the magic of Kevin Costner in a sports film, which has only failed me once. I found this movie delightful. It presents the draft as a fascinating chess match that requires a ton of planning, and a team of advisers who try to explore every possible angle. Even with all that preparation, when the clock starts ticking it can rattle even the most seasoned professionals, and require a lot of thinking on your toes. I know dramatic twists like we see in this film are probably few and far between, but it's still fun to explore the possibility.There were a couple aspects of Draft Day that didn't click quite as well for me. The biggest problem was the family relationship subplot. It worked to show some of our main character's history, and it did establish one more point of pressure that he had to contend with while trying to do his job. However, it didn't quite have the impact on the central plot that I would have liked, and the payoff with his mother at the end lacked the strength of the other dramatic moments. It didn't bother me that any of this was included in the film, but I wish it added more to the story. My other minor nitpick is simply the Cleveland Browns of it all. Believe me, as a lifelong Detroit Lions fan, I know what it's like to root for a franchise that can never get it right. But having the Browns as the central team in this story had me chuckling more than once. It's just hard to buy into the fact that any manager (even in a fictional film) could do something special enough to make them a winning team. Needless to say, these are fairly minor nitpicks. I loved Draft Day, and I'm considering a re-watch soon."
" Great insight into behind-the-scenes sport stuff
",0.6249,0.8728,2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"An American friend of mine had recommended this to me to watch a year or so ago when I was talking to her about the Aussie Rules draft period that was going on at that time. I finally got around to doing so recently.I really enjoyed the movie, which gave insight into the huge pressure people in the sports industry can be under sometimes - especially with American sports that are incredibly wealthy, compared to our little Aussie Rules com. It also had the personal side which Costner's character was having to balance with that pressure of work.There is really some 'wizardry' that seems to go into draft and trade periods in Aussie Rules, and the same can be seen in this movie as well. It shows that people must do their due diligence in investigating potential draft prospects, and it'd be very easy to make mistakes that will turn out to be extremely costly (both on a personal level and at a team level, which can affect millions of fans).It's funny to think that something that might seem completely uninteresting to some (how players are drafted into teams) could be made into a great dramatic story, but this movie achieved that."

" Every Football Fans Fantasy! Draft Day!
",0.0,0.9838,2019-12-19 00:00:00,8,"If you are a football fan, NFL not MLS sorry, you must watch ""Draft Day"". It must be one of the most exciting, heart pounding, teeth grinding sports movies I have watched in a long time! ""Remember the Titans"" level. The story line is great, the drama feels real and just an all-around feel-good movie.
It THE day. Draft day, to me, is the second most important day in football. The Superbowl being the first. This is the day your team decides its future. The gamble of your first pick on any available player that can make or break your franchise. What a rush!
Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner), is the General Manager for the Cleveland Browns. With the major pressure of the draft, after a mediocre year, there is more problems in his life than just the draft. The owner, Frank Langella, wants to make a splash in the draft. Well Sonny has his own ideas. Add that along with the new coach and it's a perfect combination of someone's feeling being hurt! What do you do? Go with your boss or please the coach of the team? What about your own thoughts on the player you want? Well today is the day. Crunch time!
My favorite part of the movie is how realistic the draft chess match is. Trading picks, trading players, and making moves! That what excites me about the draft. When that clock starts, will you be ready? With ten minutes given to each team, the first round of the draft has to be heart stopping for some teams.
What makes this movie so great is how easily relatable it is. Even though these are people of power and money, you feel connected in the real life struggles they face. Even the players being drafted come from so many different backgrounds. I can only imagine what it would be like to sit at the table at the draft as a player waiting to hear your name called."
" Well-Made
",0.0,0.9809,2019-11-13 00:00:00,7,Strong movie that is well put together. The movie has a good number of surprises. The story plays itself out extremely well. Kevin Costner and his fantastic acting is arguably the movie's best asset. Very enjoyable and worth it for any football fan.
" A smart, fun movie with a ""super"" cast.
",0.7184,0.9956,2019-10-26 00:00:00,9,"This is not a football movie. This IS a movie about life, love, regrets, and redemption. It plays against the backdrop of the NFL, but is the story of a man trying to do the right thing on many levels. The movie is shot beautifully, uses production values well, making it slick and quick moving.
Them moving to the cast; The Black Panther, Electra, the father of Gwen Stacy, and the man who raised Superman. So many recognizable and respected people just abound. A film where a perfect Dennis Leary is nearly forgotten means there must be a lot else going on.
And for the record, Kevin Costner is a treasure. If there need be evidence; I could say Untouchables, Silverado, For Love of the Game. I would then bring up his own masterpiece, Dances With Wolves. My heart would then send forth Bull Durham, maybe his best work. Of course, saving the best for last, Field of Dreams must be regarded as a stunning achievement in the medium. How many legendary scenes can one movie contain? It reminds one of the The Dark Knight, which had so many transcendent times that blow all other works away."
" An Exciting Film which Keeps the Tension Going from Start to Finish
",0.2263,0.1073,2019-09-26 00:00:00,8,"This film begins with the general manager for the Cleveland Browns by the name of ""Sonny Weaver Jr."" (Kevin Costner) being told by his girlfriend ""Ali"" (Jennifer Garner) that she is pregnant. It is then learned that the Cleveland Browns have the seventh draft pick and that Sonny's secret plan is to select a linebacker by the name ""Volante Mack"" (Chadwick Boseman) at that time. However, the owner of the Cleveland Browns, ""Anthony Miller"" (Frank Langella) essentially tells Sonny that he expects him to excel in this year's draft which subsequently puts pressure on Sonny to do something dramatic-or else. As a result, Sonny accepts an offer from the Seattle Seahawks to acquire the number 1 pick overall for Cleveland's first three draft choices next year. This infuriates a number of people in his front office who believe that he has traded away the Cleveland Brown's future for a quarterback that they didn't necessarily need. To make matters even worse, Sonny secretly believes this as well and becomes determined to fix the problem one way or another. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that those viewers who are unfamiliar with the intricacies and pressure of an NFL draft may not quite appreciate the high stakes tension that goes into this particular situation. Fortunately, Kevin Costner puts in an excellent performance and maintains the tension start-to-finish. In addition to that, there is an interesting twist at the end which ties many of the loose ends together quite well. In any case, I really enjoyed this film and because of that I have rated it accordingly."

Kind of Transfer Deadline Day: The Movie, this watchably slight sports drama finds the manager of mid-level football team the Cleveland Browns taking risky chances to land the wisest picks of the college draft while his personal life collapses around him. So it's Moneyball directed by Ivan Reitman, light on its toes, but missing the bite and smarts of that Aaron Sorkin-infused cracker.

He wants to scramble the pieces and find a way to pick them up perfectly, as if swiping left and right on his regretful past. The owner was right to quarrel, seeing him play god with so many fates on the line. The ghost returns so they pass over the QB. The mistake was right, sort of the father's forgiveness. Often you get it with privilege or unexpressed intelligence, that desire to create problems since life can't match your pace or intensity; it ends, usually, in catastrophe and death. Costner is so right for that; and for how most actors his age now sleepwalk through roles, he's been sleepwalking them for three decades, for him somehow it still feels there's a careful craft. He is addicted to 'life as a game.' The love interest was him gone wrong. The other GMs are comically idiots and can't keep up with him and want to know what he knows that the rest of them don't--it's a scripting convenience, but the 'serendipity' is why we go to theaters.

Everyone believes in police procedurals, a few admit there are medical procedurals, but I think there can be anything. This is a Sports Procedural.And it works as such. A drama, wrapped around and constrained by the minutiae of the process such as the time constraint.It even has a sort of ""mystery"" of discovering what the right choice is, and why. It works for me.I assume it was set up for an international market as some clever plan to make everyone love American Football, by over-explaining stuff, but I think the intros to each city, etc. worked well actually. I assume some are annoyed by this however.The core actors do a pretty good job. Costner is a bit too typical Costner but pretty good, Garner is... well, her best role is certainly credit card commercials unfortunately, but Denis Leary is excellent (and not too much like himself), Frank Langella is surprisingly nuanced for the Evil Businessman. Aside from Sam Elliott who is always awesome, the supporting cast is really, really hit and miss, with way too many misses. I suspect - knowing nothing of football - a lot were stunt casting, or gifts to the league. A few people even seemed like they should have had lines, but were edited out because they were just too awful.All in all, a pretty good story, a pretty good script, but let down by some poor acting, and some odd editing choices (oh lord, that split screen crap)."

I'm a draft and college recruiting nerd so to speak and this movie scratched my itch! It was well acted and well written, I've seen it a 100 times and still get chills when watching Sonny(Costner) work the phones in the ""war room ""(not political). This was a different sports movie that everyone can enjoy even if you're not a huge football fan or know nothing about the draft, you don't have to be a expert draft analyst like my friend who seemed to not like it because he didn't find it believable because he's seen every minute of every draft.

Costner makes a deal he comes to regret, finding himself between the proverbial rock and a hard place and needs to do some dealing to keep his job.I did not find the fictional drama very engaging. A more fun film could have been quirky die hard draft fans showing up expecting their team to get Ricky Williams and winding up with McNabb.

Personal and professional life clash and the extreme pressure of the general manager of an NFL team manager was safe with Costner and Garner never looked more beautiful or sensible.

" The magic of the men in the background
",0.0,0.9348,2017-11-26 00:00:00,7,"""Draft Day"" is a movie with Kevin Costner, telling the story of a NFL executive working for the Cleveland Browns who prepares for the annual Draft Day and gets in real trouble when he agrees on what seems to be a fabulous deal but turns out to be a dangerous trade when the prime candidate shows some dark sides and the coach disagrees on the deal.This is indeed a strong movie because it manages to create a thriller out of seemingly rather usual executive actions and makes you root for a main character that is, objectively spoken, not the most sympathetic guy. Personally I would have preferred had they taken an actual example of a real draft rather than create a fictional scenario but nonetheless this turns out to be a better thriller than many titles that include horrible crimes and chasing scenes. Of course this one also comes with a set of A-class actors but it would also work without them and that deserves respect.All in all I was never bored and really wanted to see how the plot turns out in the end. Of course you should have some basic knowledge of the sport or at least some interest but this could also be a good way to introduce you to the fascination of the game and everything that surrounds it."
" A Surprisingly Good Move for a non-Football Fan
",0.7506,0.8955,2017-11-20 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie finally because it was made here in Cleveland and I know people who were extras in it. I want you to know that I am not a football fan, nor am I a Browns fan. I do not watch the games and could absolutely not care less who wins or loses. However, being a living- breathing being who does listen to the radio, I know a slight amount about draft day and am familiar with the hype surrounding certain players and our ever-hopeful for next year fans here.That being said, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much. It's not really a ""sports movie"" as other reviews have said; it's more an inside look at the big day, the rules and conventions, how life goes on for others despite this day and how the ""perfect choice"" is different for different people. You hope your coach chooses your guy, but what does he know that you do not? It's like choosing a spouse, in the long-run who will be best for the team?"
" A missed opportunity - Draft Day will only (superficially) entertain those who are already devotees of its subject matter
",0.5423,0.9936,2017-11-17 00:00:00,7,"This film was well-acted and competently shot, but it definitely can't be called a great sports film. Great sports films transcend the sport they portray. At many points, Draft Day finds itself challenged to even transcend the annual event of the NFL draft. Indeed, at times the film felt like a mere vehicle for promoting the TV extravaganza that the NFL has made of its annual rookie selection process. I was certainly entertained by the concept and plot, as I'm a fairly engaged NFL fan and an avid follower of the off-season moves that NFL personnel offices make in order to improve their teams. However, I think that this film is entertaining to people like me and no one else, which is unfortunate. There was real human drama and consequence that could have been added to the film if a few of the other characters were better developed. While Costner's character was fairly well fleshed out, Chadwick Boseman's, Dennis Leary's, and most importantly Jennifer Garner's were not, and instead felt like mere placeholders (and at times even sports movie clich√©s). In my estimation, the director and writers missed a prime opportunity to show the personal stress and grueling work hours that can accompany the high-profile positions these characters each hold in a multi-billion-dollar industry. A few scenes of how the demands of professional football impact their family relationships and how their lives are seasonally consumed with the work of running the organization (and in the case of Boseman's character, of trying to break into an industry that will batter his body but allow him to acquire wealth and security for his family). The scenes in Draft Day that attempt to touch on these issues are superficial at best, and didn't effectively convey the struggles these people face, even while they are scrutinized and shamed by the general public, and hounded by the media. POSSIBLE SPOILER: the scene that did partially touch on the fan reaction side was so detached as to be comical, with fans protesting outside the stadium of a GM who made a decision they didn't like.In all, I would call Draft Day a missed opportunity - The script was good, the cast was excellent, and there is a hint of the high stakes that the NFL Draft can encompass, but the movie fails to do anything to get the attention of those who aren't already at least casual fans of the NFL and it's Draft event. And in that, I would say that it even fails in its attempt (and I would argue that this is the real goal of the film in the first place) to attract an expanded viewership to the NFL's Draft Day event. For my part, even as a staunch fan of NFL football and professional sports personnel machinations, I was mostly bored while watching Draft Day."
" Fast based, story driven movie, that sucks you into the Draft universe.
",-0.3612,0.9693,2017-10-03 00:00:00,10,"First of all, I am very disappointed with peoples reviews in here. People are reviewing it bad because, ""it's not for people outside of America.."" ""It's only for people who likes the nfl."", "" It's only for Draft enthusiasts.."", etc.. In my opinion, this movie is a fast based story driven movie, that does everything right. I myself, is from Denmark, Europe, and I am very interested in the NFL, and American football. We actually have American football in europe, if people wanna know, and it is actually a big sport in some countries. (france, Big Britain, Germany, Finland, etc.I made it a tradition at home now, to watch this movie, before the NFL draft every year, and last time I did, my girlfriend watched it with me. She isn't much interested in sports, but she gave it a go.. I was telling her she could just go to sleep when she was tired, because the Draft would start at 02:00am here in Denmark. Pretty late on a workday. She gave it a change, and after the first 15 mins of the movie, she was sucked into this new univers of the NFL Draft. The movie is nowhere near Jurassic Park, (a personal favorite of mine..) but I am comparing it with it anyways, because, what Jurassic Park was so good at, was drawing the audience into the movie, to make it so exciting. That is what Draft Day does as well. This is maybe not a 10/10 movie, but I think it desserves some support out of all the bad reviews in here. It doesn't desserve a rating under 7.5. There is BY FAR!! a lot worse movies out there than Draft Day!The Point is, IT IS watchable for people outside of USA, and it IS watchable for people, who isn't that interessted in football, but just wanna watch a good story driven movie!

" Good movie, with flaws.
",0.4404,0.9839,2017-09-30 00:00:00,7,"There are some holes in the story, such as the owner, Molina, being able to travel almost instantaneously hundreds of miles, and having an unexplained change of mind regarding Weaver's moves, but all in all, this is a good movie. Kevin Costner gives an excellent performance as a football general manager who has to weigh loyalty versus expediency as he tries to put together a winning team. The movie does a good job in conveying the sense of pressure as teams compete with each other to parley draft picks. The movie shows how a mere rumor can effect the draft, and the critical role of the general manager in trying to separate fiction from fact when determining who to select. The movie also does a good job in dramatizing what happens when confidence in the general manager erodes. The movie shows the general manager, Weaver, making some really questionable moves, such as trading away THREE future number one draft picks for a number one draft pick that the GM has not fully vetted. Also, other stuff that's pure Hollywood is the quarterback trashing the GM's office (never would happen), one GM calling another GM an expletive, the GM's mother berating her son while he's deal making, the head coach negotiating behind the GM's back, and the GM having a sexual relationship with the team's financial officer (who just so happens to be a young and attractive lady). Nevertheless, the movie's basic story line, a general manager operating under pressure to make decisions that effects an entire football team, remains intact. For that reason, this is a movie that is worth watching. Just remember, however, that this movie is fiction."
" Draft Day Review.
",0.0,0.9944,2017-09-27 00:00:00,7,"Draft Day is a quaint, feel good sports drama, that focuses on the more mundane backroom elements that go into running a professional sports team. The film stars Kevin Costner as Sonny Weaver Jr. the general manager of the Cleveland Browns. At the start of the film Sonny is given an opportunity to trade his number 1 pick for three consecutive years, to have the ability to sign a highly rated Quarterback in this years draft. After getting cold feet upon accepting the deal, he spends the rest of the day wheeling and dealing with other GM's to get the best deal for his team and come out on top by days end.Right away it's safe to say that this film will alienate a large chuck of its audience. Especially those outside the U.S or those that don't follow the NFL. Ivan Reitman who directs this film understands this, so to compensate for this he uses a-lot of exposition to educate his audience. This is a useful tool for some, but for me, as someone that is a fan of American football I found it ear-gratingly cheesy. The fact that a GM needs reminding what number Tom Brady was picked at, felt silly. There were a couple of exposition heavy scenes like this that had me rolling my eyes.Whilst the exposition at times was irritating, I do understand why it was needed. The fact that Ivan Reitman was able to make a sports film that contained no sporting action, as fun and engaging as this film was, is a fantastic achievement. The screenplay whilst fairly standard manages to run along at a decent pace. Never at any moment did Draft day feel boring or dull, even if it was predictable in it's resolutions.Where the film triumphs is in Kevin Costners performance. Costner is at his charismatic best in this film. He brings warmth and empathy to his character that makes you root for him to come out on top by days end. He's also surrounded by terrific performances from a great supporting cast that features Jennifer Garner, Dennis Leary, Frank Langella to name but a few.Draft Day may be lacking in dramatic tension that most sports films have, but what it does do is shine a spotlight on an aspect of sport that isn't as sexy or cool to talk about. The fact that Reitman was able to have me root for the backroom staff is a wonderful achievement in my book."
" Realistic look at wheeling and dealing on NFL draft day
",0.0,0.9899,2017-08-15 00:00:00,8,"""Draft Day"" is quite unusual as a sports movie. It doesn't show any of the cast actually playing or coaching in practice or a game. It does have some film clips of great NFL games of the past. What it's about is the behind the scenes big business of building teams each year during the NFL draft. It includes aspects of caring about players, talent scouts and searches, player agents, owners, coaches and team managers.And, for the realism of this film, it includes scenes that show some of the NFL stadiums around the U.S. Other realism is added with the on-site filming of the 2013 NFL draft in New York City, and scripted reports by TV sports show hosts Chris Berman and others. While some may be put off by the backstage wrangling and big business aspects of professional football, this gives a glimpse of what that must be like. Without the NFL draft to regulate and help level the field for various franchises to build their teams, the sport would be chaotic and probably dwindle to just a few teams that had the backing to afford the salaries and costs. The cast all perform well. Kevin Costner, as Sonny Weaver Jr., gives a real sense of the angst a manager must go through around the time of the annual NFL draft. All of the cast give good performances. I thought it somewhat strange and out of character, though, for Sonny's mother to insist on spreading her husband's ashes on the field on the most trying day of the year for her son. As a football wife and widow, she surely would have waited until the next day. The film has a sense of reality about it. It's refreshing for not being laden with foul language. It has romance without the frequent Hollywood nudity or sex. It reflects the growing modern view of intimate relationships, including having children, with no thoughts or commitments for marriage. Most sports fan should enjoy this film, and others should find it interesting. It may help non-enthusiasts to a little better understand the scope of professional football. My favorite line in the film is Ali (played by Jennifer Garner) telling Sonny, ""There's no such thing as a sure thing. At the end of the day, all that matters¬Ö is what do you think?"" (sic)"

" For avid Sports fans
",0.296,0.9955,2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Draft Day (2014) is a film for which is mainly centered for the most avid of sports football fans alike. Being described as a ""sports"" film but this is technically not a sports film in that it is more so based on the event of the draft than the actual sport of football. Football is mainly very popular in American and the box office numbers of this film very evidently show that, as this film was non- existent in the foreign market (making less than $1 million). This is a main reason why this film has been considered a box office flop since most of the money it made was domestic, and with a considerable large budget of $25 million it was difficult in making back the money. Had this film had a better outing, it most likely would have been greenlit for a sequel as the ending of the film and overall tone suggested a sequel could have happened.About the film, Draft Day is quality in entertainment and the writing is quite well. Centering on Kevin Coaster, portraying a general manager of the Cleveland Browns (a team with many misfortunes within the last decade plus). Draft Day shows the behind the scenes of how much pressure is on the GM as well as the team in making the right choice to better their football team. It plays out somewhat of a documentary but remains entertaining and intriguing due to well thought out subplots and overall interest of the event. Being better than expected, there was a certain level of drama and intrigued throughout and the results did leave audiences well put. Such as we are engaged in the decisions the GM was to make for their team, even though we are not fans of the particularly team. We wanted to know which player Coaster's character would select in the draft, and it was not as predictable as one though, which is a plus. Another good thing is there wasn't any forced cheesy humor that we see a lot in these type of sports drama, this film kept it authentic and it worked. Memorable quote said by Coaster: ""No one can stop a ticking clock, the great ones always find a way to slow it down."" Overall, since Draft Day did not perform as well as it could have, this film remains for quality avid football fans and is quite underrated at that."
" Great Movie for NFL Fans (Basic Football Explanation Included for Reference)
",0.6249,0.9949,2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"This is one of the better efforts I've seen that depicts what goes on behind the scenes in the National Football League during the actual draft. The film starts with a quote which describes everything you need to know before digging in:""32 Teams, 7 Rounds, 224 Young men who today are about to become players in the National Football League. A day where lives are changed, fates are decided, dynasties are born. And the clock is always ticking. Of course, I'm talking about draft day.""Kevin Cosner is the real star here, giving an outstanding performance as the General Manager of a losing Cleveland Browns franchise. He is under an unbelievable amount of pressure to choose the best plan of action AND draft picks in order to correct the string of losses and inevitably save his own job.That's really all there is to it. This is a very accurate rendition of how a draft works behind the scenes, showing how coaches and GM's call one another to negotiate deals in a far less formal way than you may imagine. They all have a deep passion for this game, as many Americans do.What really won me over was the way that this builds up from the days before draft day right into the actual draft picks as the clock ticks. I actually felt the tension and was noticeably stressed out while watching them debate what to do next. The film was one giant crescendo to the very end.REGARDING THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH FOOTBALL:In much the same way that many Americans will watch films about soccer, rugby and cricket, this is no exception. I've watched the likes of ""Death of a Gentleman"" (Cricket), ""Invictus"" (Rugby), or Becoming Zlatan (European football) and managed to follow. Draft Day is no exception.Here are a few things for the unfamiliar that might help when watching:the way all these teams get talented new players is largely through a system set up by the league. Just like soccer teams have junior divisions, in football they take their picks from the best players on American college football teams. There really is no other way of finding high-quality athletes who can compete in this sport unless they were on a college team (generally, but there are exceptions).So on draft day, all football teams are given a number which determines the order for taking turns picking the best players all college teams across the country. This order is determined based on how well a team did the previous season (the last place team will pick first the following year, often getting the best college talent).This is of course is just the general idea. From that 1st pick, the teams all take turns selecting from remaining players to fill the positions they are in need of stronger talent. It's a giant game of strategy, trying to get more quality players that are needed at different positions before someone else comes and takes them.Hopefully this helps. There have not been any films that I have seen depict the strategy that goes into the draft (selection process) in the NFL. It is also a big deal for the players who want to be picked, because they are not allowed to make any money while playing football in college (don't ask why, it just works that way). So to be picked is likened to finding out you have won the lottery (finally going to make good money).And finally, regardless of opinion, this was made for just $25 million (USD) which is next to nothing comparing to your average run-of-the-mill budget.----- 7/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"
" Reminded me a lot of 1996's Jerry Maguire
",0.0,0.9661,2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"Oh well, this film is nothing special to rave about, but it is a good time waster and although an obvious aging Kevin Costner (62) who like many aging actors choose to color their hair in an unrealistic vanity color has an unrealistic sexual relationship with the much younger Jennifer Garner (44). I guess that was one way the producers were able to secure Costner in the lead role playing Sonny Weaver Jr., the GM for NFL's perennial losers the Cleveland Browns. Ms. Garner plays the teams financial guru Ali, who besides keeping the Browns books straight, Ali has also been keeping Sonny straight to the point that she is carrying his baby. As I said earlier this must have been another vanity project for Kostner as the stud GM porking the much younger and hotter bean counter Ali. I would have found the story line much more interesting and a lot less jaundiced if Kostner's love interest was someone more around his own age, someone like Michelle Pfeiffer, Jamie Lee Curtis or maybe Kim Basinger. I know this is just a sports film but if I am going to watch a film I want to at least feel as if the story line is somewhat realistic.Okay so now that Kostner's irritating vanity has been addressed I could not help but be reminded of the player/agent Jerry Maguire in the film of the same name (Jerry Maguire-1996) played by Tom (snooze) Cruise who stuck by his injured wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and so I quickly drew the comparison between Rod Tidwell and that of actor Chadwick Boseman as a college linebacker Vontae Mack. Boseman played his role to perfection not trying to be a scene stealer from the star Kostner but I must say my attention was on Boseman's performance more than anyone else's.It is also difficult for me to believe that competing GM's could actually pull off the scenario on draft day that Cleveland Brown's GM Sonny Weaver Jr. pulled off in this film. I don't want to have to add this as a spoiler but I will end my review with a common statement made by many sportscasters including that made by ESPN's sportscaster Chris Berman who opened up the film and what he should have said was ""Come on Man!!!!"""
