" Great Action Adventure Film
",0.7506,0.989,2021-04-07 00:00:00,8,"The Finest Hours tells the true story (with embellishments) of a sea rescue by the Coast Guard.Yays:Some of the best use of CGI I've ever seen. While you know it is being used you can't quite ""see"" it. It is never used in place of more realistic methods and is used only when necessary to achieve a much more effective telling of the story.Great showing of the reliance on self and team to reach an objective. Excellent scenes on and in the doomed tanker showing extraordinary measures of the men engineering make-shift solutions to try to buy time and save lives.Good acting, good pacing.Boos:Sappy love interest that feels rushed.Love interest (girl) who seems to know more more about everyone else's job than they do (man dumb, woman smart).Love interest (girl) who is the only one who figures out that shining her car lights out to the ocean so her man can detect home port at night in a storm when the power is out so that she can be a ""hero"" too is ridiculous... as if the Coast Guard wouldn't have a contingency plan for a power outage... even if shining car headlights off the coast is the plan.Summary-See it for the excellent CGI use that creates action scenes that are incredible. Try to ignore the fictional ""I'm a hero too"" Disney Princess."

" Worth while
",0.2263,0.9314,2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,So often the realities of professions that involve risking ones own life as a necessity in order to save others is told without focus upon the fact that often these rescues just dont happen because men will not risk their own safety Regardless of it being the purpose for which they are paid for. This is an Honest look at heroism & self preservation in the face of the seemingly insermountable.
" Really good watch
",0.4927,0.998,2020-11-25 00:00:00,7,"I know this movie has been criticized, but EVERYONE'S a critic, especially on the internet! I really enjoyed this movie, and I think my husband did as well, the scenes at sea were pretty darn good, similar to ""The Perfect Storm"". Casey Affleck and Chris Pines performances were really good as usual, and so were many supporting actors such as Abraham Benrubi ( from ER fame) Ben Foster, whom I saw in NYC at St Ann's Warehouse theatre in the round, in Streetcar Named Desire with Gillian Anderson (it was amazing and you were great Ben) as well as many others. The fact it was based on a true story was pretty amazing, how brave (crazy) those guys were to venture out in that storm but WOW, they saved them, or most of them, don't want to spoil more! Definitely worth watching and waffling between a 7 and an 8, so you should see it, even if just for the true story alone, I hadn't heard of it before the movie came out!"
" A solid movie
",0.1531,-0.1298,2020-11-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a very entertaining movie that would be suitable for a family movie night as long as very young children aren't involved. This movie will probably be to boring and frightening at the same time.
Most of the performances are on par with what is desired for this movie. Although there are some character persona choices that don't seem ""real""; mainly both leads Chris and Casey (their accent choice just seems off).
The action sequences are intense and I could not imagine actually having to go through that if it were in real life which makes what they do that much more spectacular.
My biggest gripe is how dark the movie is and really needs to be watched in the dark so that you can watch it properly and see everything. If you watch with the lights on you may miss what the graphic artists did to make this movie come to life."

Nothing more than that, but nothing less either.'The Finest Hours' is a little bit too on the nose in parts, I felt like some of the cast were overacting here and there - especially Casey Affleck (Ray), not that he is bad though. Chris Pine is enjoyable in the lead role. Pacing is iffy, but the effects are excellent - from the ships to the water scenes, impressive!

" All Hands Abandon Movie!
",-0.4926,-0.9321,2020-09-15 00:00:00,3,"Yikes. I just got done watching this movie. What a disaster of story telling. Somehow other reviewers tout this movie as a nice ""old fashioned"" style film. I love old fashioned films, love classic films, I am a huge film buff. I mean Ben Foster is obviously pretending to be a Van Johnson persona here. This movie is a disaster all in all. Its a waste of a good cast, waste of a true story. The script is downright boring, contrived as others have said, and bland. There is no character development so no investment. The efforts of the sinking tanker's engineer was the most interesting parts of the story, the premise of how to keep the tanker afloat and steer the tanker. I would say this was the most suspenseful building potential of the film, that is until the next cut which then spoils any momentum of this story. The damsel fiance wife ending up stuck in a ditch in the snow is probably the worst nail biting twist in the story. When you see this film...Please tell me how in the world a radio that has been drowned in sea water all of a sudden works!? I am not surprised that Disney made this movie. Seeing how they totally dismantled the Star Wars Saga at their first outing baffles the mind. They should just stick with animated kid stuff. This movie has zero suspense for a story that I am sure had real suspense as it was unfolding in the middle of the open sea. I give this movie 3 stars because it has no pulse."

" This was a fine movie

I assumed it was put in there to increase the screen time or make us more emotionally involved in the movie...it did the opposite for me. It just annoyed me. The rescue and the circumstances surrounding the event didn't require a contrived love interest. The actual rescue elements of the movie where entertaining and interesting enough.

Chris Pine was good and Ben Foster was ok. Casey Affleck acting was commendable. Holliday Grainger was charming but irritating.Screenplay was ok but special effects were not convincing and in some scenes it looked like they were filming in a pond.

I didnt know regular boats could shoot under the water like a torpedo for as long as they did. Oh and cant forget when they went submarining they didnt lose one crew member in the process. An open air boat going full on submarine and not ONE crew member floated away??? Hmmmm ok. Then how bout those epic waves they had to surf going over the Bar... Wait I meant to say Bah... They are from Boston so its not bar, but bah... Who would tackle those waves one in a small little dingy? C'mon man give us viewers a little credit for not being stupid or totally gullible Then the big ship sinks exactly where it beached itself??? Yup it sunk basically in the same place as it was beached. Okay then how about the water during this massive snow storm... With all the submarining they did you would think one would have a little hypothermia.. You know kind of like jack Dawson?? Nope not a one even looked cold during the entire movie. Like I said they embellished everything they could to make it more dramatic. It was almost unwatchable at times it was so hokey...

" Thrilling story sunk by conventional script
",0.4767,0.9866,2020-01-16 00:00:00,7,"As someone who has lived at various places on the British coast all his life I have tremendous respect for the men of our Royal National Lifeboat Institution - all volunteers - who are willing to risk their lives to rescue others, and I love sea stories. The US Coastguard is managed by the government and has salaried officers, but on the evidence of this film they have more than their own share of guts and determination.The best scenes in this film are undoubtedly those set at sea, the crew of the Pendleton jury-rigging a helm and nursing the hulk along until she can be run aground, and the men of CG 36500 fighting their way out to sea to save them (even if CG 36500 does develop the characteristics of a submarine a couple of times. I know lifeboats are designed to be non-sinkable, but not *that* non-sinkable). These scenes are truly edge-of-the-seat thrilling.Unfortunately, in order to make a film, the story has to be 'dramatised'. So the Coast Guard station is commanded by an outsider mistrusted by locals who matter darkly over every decision he makes, and the hero is partly shunned as a Jonah after a failed rescue the previous year. (Is everyone around Cape Cod so sour and miserable? Just asking). On the Pendleton there is some Alpha-Male tussling for supremacy among the crew until they accept the ""it's so crazy it might just work"" ideas of the Chief Engineer. These back stories feel very forced and detract from the true drama of the rescue itself.The film tells a good story, but not always in a good way. Worth watching once, but not a film to keep coming back to."
" Unrealistic to the point of laughable.
",0.0516,-0.5777,2020-01-15 00:00:00,4,"This should have been a good film. There was an interesting and action packed tale that could have been told. Alas, it was not to be. It wasn't terrible but it could have been so much better. The romantic storyline with Holliday Grainger should have been a minor detail, not taken up a third of the film. Her character was so annoying and wimpy, you just wanted to give her a shake and tell her to shut up. What really killed it for me, though, was the lack of realism with a lot of the scenes at sea. For the most part, the coastguard boat was sailing along as if it was in smooth seas. Despite this being a massive storm, they hardly moved. As a sailor, this drove me nuts - even in moderate seas, boats move back and forward. And in storms, they move a lot. The crew of both vessels involved would have been getting thrown around not calmly staying upright. It wouldn't have been hard for the filmmakers to have made this a bit more believable. Save this one for a rainy day, when you've nothing better to watch."
" It is awful at every level
",-0.4588,-0.8534,2020-01-13 00:00:00,1,This is a disaster movie and I mean a disaster of a movie. A true story is ruined by bad direction at every level.

" A decidedly mixed bag of a movie
",0.0,-0.9041,2019-11-25 00:00:00,6,"Some mild spoilers.I grew up on the east coast, and I know a little about the crazy storms there; I also am a sailor, and have had my share of vomit inducing rough rides in my current west coast location, but I have never seen *anything* like the storm described in the book this movie is based on, although I can extrapolate a little to get some idea of what it must have been like... a truly terrifying experience. Those are the spots of the movie I think they got right - you had a sense of the extreme cold, the wicked seas, the hopelessness of the rescue mission, the desperation and determination.What I thought was a failure were the personal portions, which were altered significantly and often painted people in a poor light, which angers me in a 'based on a true story' movie and was totally unnecessary. For instance - Miriam and Bernie were already married and she was sick with the flu and worried in bed when Bernie went out; the total drama and mockery of her 'asking him to get married' was unnecessary (she DID propose to him, apparently, but they had already been married for over a year at the time of the rescue) and didn't enhance the story, nor did Miriam's lecturing the commander, Daniel Cluff. Every military spouse I have ever met and spoken to knows the risks of the life and would never barge into the CO's office and demand he/she be removed from a mission. It seemed forced and silly because it was - it wasn't true, she never did it, and at times they almost made Cluff seem like a buffoon - which from what I have read, he wasn't.There was also no need to contrive the story about Ray Sybert and someone on the ship knocking heads - there was enough drama, and I think it detracted from what personally happened in a harrowing situation. Sybert stepped into the Captain's shoes when the boat foundered and there was enough there without concocting something ridiculous about a makeshift rudder and beaching when by the book's account that didn't happen, and I am not sure that physically it would be possible.It would have been better if the movie had stuck with the FULL story of that day - the attempt at a double rescue of crew of two oil tankers that had BOTH split in half. The Fort Mercer story had a lot of nail-biting moments too, and I think that movie that showed this double rescue would have been better than what was produced. Bernie and his crew were genuine, gold-plated heroes, and the Coasties rescuing men from the Fort Mercer were also, and I think celebrating them - people who go out in the worst conditions to rescue absolute strangers - is a triumph on it's own, especially considering the backdrop this record storm created."

" A Slow Methodical Action Thriller
",0.25,0.6461,2019-01-12 00:00:00,7,"14 September 2016. This slower paced action thriller doesn't quite have the intensity as its similar predecessor as The Perfect Storm (2000). This mostly by the numbers action thriller has it all though, the girl, the struggle against the elements and yet for all the histrionics the movie isn't has dramatic or epic as Titanic (1997). Perhaps, its the difficulty of transferring the real life story onto the screen in a way that maintains the authentic story of what happened and at the same time include the dramatic flourishes. Maybe its just the unbelievability of the plot points. Or maybe because of the imbalance between not a lot going on at times and the crush of too many things going on at other times. The movie however does proceed point to point, including all the requisite emotions, good guys, bad guys, romance even while there is for some reason distance between the characters. Unlike actually experiencing the involvement in the movie, the audience is more of a passive spectator unswept by the action-thrillers being presented."
" Finest Heroes At Sea...
",0.5106,0.9921,2019-01-10 00:00:00,6,"The Finest Hours is a film that went to cinemas and received very little attention or promotion. Even when the words ""produced by Walt Disney"" were used, the film gained very little interest at the box office. Why? Is is because this a bad film? Or did the world just simply miss a great film of 2016? Well, the result is a mix bag.The Finest Hours is based on a true story of a disaster where 2 oil tankers were destroyed and broke in half, one half left floating at sea during a huge storm in the year 1952.The cast line up at first glance is nothing to be disappointed in. Cast member includes Chris Pine (Star Trek), Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone), Ben Foster (Lone Survivor) & Eric Bana (Munich)The film begins with an introduction to Bernie (Chris Pine), a coast guard member stationed in Chatham. Bernie sits in his car with his friend from the station and expresses the nerves that he has as he tries to build up the courage to meet someone who could be the girl of his dreams. It's very evident that Bernie struggles to be confident in himself and is introduced as a considerate gentlemen. After gathering the courage, Bernie walks inside a local cafe and meets Miriam (Holliday Grainger). Needless to say the two fall in love and after a short time agree to marry.Meanwhile, Ray (Casey Affleck) is on board an oil tanker during the heavy storm. After the tanker is cut in half due to the storm Ray is required to make a stand as the surviving senior officer and lead his remaining team members to survive as long as they can until rescuers arrive at sea.On this same night, Bernie's goal was to ask permission for marriage by his station's commander. Instead, Bernie's night changes forever when he is called to lead a small team on what could be classed as a complete suicide mission. Their mission: to rescue the remaining survivors on the oil tanker with the assistance of three other men during the intense weather. Because of Bernie's nature, he nods and accepts the mission with no questions asked (even if he thinks it could actually cost his own life!), even when the men around him know there is very little chance of him returning. The three men who join Bernie for the mission stand as volunteers.Chris Pine as Bernie is actually displaying one of his better role in his acting career. It was great to see this actor play a character who wasn't so charming and up himself (such as what we've seen in Star Trek or This Means War). Chris Pine is normally the same type of actor in most films. This was a great refresher and reminder that Chris Pine can take on more of a challenging and inspiring role. Even the smaller details of Chris Pine's acting, the way he walks and the way he hangs his head low are different than his norm. Chris Pine was the strongest part of this film.It was great to see so many key actors in this true story film, but, in my option, their full potential is simply not used. This is something that I suggest may have come from the overall direction and from the film's script. The film's strongest point is also located in the third act where everything was simply a build up. The film's title I feel is also not appealing to anyone and doesn't represent the film's tone. I'll also state that when the film arrived at the big screens, I don't recall seeing any posters or a film trailer to promote the film (Am I the only one here?).The Finest Hours does overall deliver a truely impacting story that will leave pleased that you took the time out to watch it. While the film doesn't warrant a repeat viewing, it's still a film that I would recommend and shouldn't be ignored.6.5/10

More's the pity, as it tells a wonderfully engrossing and thrilling true life marine rescue on two levels; as seen from the rescued on the stricken SS Pendleton and their Coast Guard would - be rescuers.Touted as being the story of the Coast Guard's greatest small boat rescue, it just seems a shame that such a fine film wasn't seen by a larger audience. Movies set on water seem to frequently have as high a disaster rate, as do the subjects with which they frequently deal (Water World, In the Heart of the Sea, Cutthroat Island etc.) and this seems to have suffered much the same fate.The Finest Hours features a great cast with Chris Pine and Casey Affleck both outstanding, playing similarly shy, somewhat introverted leadership roles; the former as a junior Coast Guard officer asked to mount a small-scale rescue attempt and the latter as the doomed ship's chief engineer, improvising desperately to keep the mortally damaged tanker afloat as long as possible to afford a chance of rescue for the surviving crew members.I really liked the highlighting of Holliday Grainger's Miriam. Though she was arguably perhaps fictionalised more than some of the other characters, in creating this strong onshore female, a powerful emotional core of the film was established. On the flip side of this, Eric Bana did his best in a fairly thankless role as the Coast Guard commander Daniel Cluff. Even just a brief perusal of his Wikipedia entry, indicates that he wasn't the self-doubting, inexperienced head of operations, we see in the film, created no doubt to provide an idealistic counterpoint to Chris Pine's almost laconically casual, Bernie Webber. In addition to this, Ben Foster stands out in a supporting role, where though having few lines of dialogue to speak, he imposes himself indelibly through a terrific range of facial expressions, glances and general body language.Unlike a vehicle such as The Perfect Storm where one felt at times the special effects weighed down the (somewhat, slight) story being told, no such claim should be made about this movie. It achieves a very comfortable balance of CGI enhanced action, which never threatens to comparatively diminish the true elements of a remarkable story some 66 years old, that this film succeeds in recognising."
" A great storm movie
",0.6249,0.9228,2018-11-18 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you there are still heroes that are human. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Heartwarming movie
",0.4767,0.9325,2018-09-28 00:00:00,10,Fine story telling; cast well chosen; beautiful emotions; nice vibes; a pleasant surprise and a touching movie
" Rousing, visually beautiful rescue adventure with heart.
",0.8591,0.7495,2018-08-29 00:00:00,8,"I've seen this three times, and I've had time to think this over. It's well acted, tense, with exceptionally effective CGI and beautiful camerawork of the New England winter in the 1950s. The acting is solid, mostly low key, understated if not laconic, and well-paced, and for icing on the cake, I didn't detect a single false note that pulled it off the screen. I think its based on a true story. It's not Oscar fare, it's not a movie you'll want to discuss in the coffeehouse afterward, but it is a movie you'll probably end up re-watching on cable when it comes around. It is worth the theater bux. 8 stars."
" Overall a superb movie
",0.6249,0.9166,2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,I thought this movie was great and made very well. The cast were excellent and the storyline was well thought out. The fact that everyone in this movie was based on the real people who were actually in this situation was incredible. I'll probably watch this movie again and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I think every character had their own character moment to explain what they were going through making you emotionally connect with the characters. It was an epic journey and I can't wait to watch it again!
" Disney feelgood shipwreck movie based on true story. Only flaw is its sugarcoated sentiment, but that makes it ideally suited for kids and family entertainment.
",0.8519,0.9929,2018-07-21 00:00:00,6,"In this shipwredk film, the action was portrayed quite suspenseful, although some special effects were rather cheesy. But then again this film is defenitely targetted at families and kids, who wont be so critical if special effects dont seem true.Casey Affleck is a favorite actor of mine and he stands for quality just by his presence. I dont know any movies with him that I dont like. In this movie he again is the best actor, by a landslide. I still didnt expect much from a disney movie, but I got pleasantly surprised by the suspense of the story anyway. The only flaw of this movie is the fact that it is a bit too much sugarcoated. The story is about a shipwreck with men fearing for their lives, but it is fair to say that the director went for a smooth, nice looking feelgood picture, so there isnt much desperation or panic to be seen, because otherwise it couldnt be sold as a family picture anymore. Now young kids can watch this suspenseful film too, without getting too scared. There is also a budding romance interwoven into the story. Women/girls will love that, but being a guy I never care much for romances in action movies. Fortunately the budding romance scenes are not many.I wont wanna see this movie again, because now I know how the story ends, the suspense is gone. And the suspense is really the only thing that kept this movie afloat. It is an ideal family film though, which will be a thrill for young kids too. In the end I blame Disney for the sugarcoating of this movie and not the director. Adults who got a little bit bored at moments watching this disney movie, might wanna check out oscar winner ""I, Tonya"" from the same director that is definitely only suited for adults with all the swearing and drugs..."
" Maybe I should have stayed with it, but 40 minutes was all I could take.
",0.0,0.6782,2018-07-09 00:00:00,6,"Forty minutes in, and I've stopped watching to write a review. That's a bad sign.So far, nothing much has happened. A bunch of B-list actors (and a couple of minor A-listers) have been shuffling around mumbling to each other. A couple of oil tankers have snapped in half - we only saw the aftermath of one, the other we've just heard about. Nothing exciting or dramatic has happened visually, unless you're impressed by computer-generated waves (but if you are, you should watch ""The Perfect Storm"" which is excellent and what this film wishes it was).Right now they're all shuffling around mumbling to each other about mounting a rescue. Astonishingly, there is absolutely zero sense of urgency about anything. None of the characters seems particularly invested in the outcome, and no one's pulse seems to have increased even slightly. They all just seem bored and depressed.This is a very strange film! A non-action action movie; a non-dramatic drama; and oh yes, there's even a non-romantic romance element in there too. I'll keep watching, just to see if anything of note manages to occur before the end, but if it does I'm sure it'll be entirely accidental. Weird."
" The film moves at a dreary pace...
",-0.34,0.9068,2018-06-20 00:00:00,4,"All the characters seemed incompetent and self-centered, and the actors acted lazily. There wasn't much enthusiasm here. Is it just me, or did everything and everyone seem to move in slow motion? In any rescue mission time is of the essence, and I didn't feel that urgency - not from the pacing or the music. Yes, even the music seemed bland. The film really moved along at a dreary pace. Also, for anyone familiar with the story, they would have known how it was going to end anyway, so there are no surprises. During the storm, the waves were inconsistent. At times there were huge swells and then suddenly close-ups on actors revealed there were hardly any motion. The actors just didn't blend with their surroundings, rendering it unbelievable. Its still a heroic tale, though, and I did enjoy the film's final 35 minutes, and loved the ending."
" PLEASE CALL THEM BACK
",0.3182,0.9354,2018-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This film is based on a true story about Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) a Coast Guard sailor who was able to pull off what is considered the greatest small boat rescue in Coast Guard history. The film opens with our reluctant hero meeting Miriam (Holliday Grainger) a strong woman who knows what she wants. She is someone who you have your doubts about, but then comes on in a strong way that you have to love her. This is the best performance I have seen from Chris Pine.The film was able to capture the deadly terror the men faced who sang to overcome their fears. It shows ""the finest"" in humanity as everyone push themselves to the edge.No swearing sex or nudity."
" Decent rescue movie that I don't think I'll watch again.
",0.5106,0.991,2018-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Reading and watching the reviews for The Finest Hours, I knew I'd be going into it not expecting much, and I wasn't disappointed. Everything about the Finest Hours is ""Ok"". Acting, directing, editing, music, story, is ok. But everything being ok in this movie makes me not care all that much about the true story it's based on.The story revolves around crewman Bernie Webber, who is sent out with 3 others to rescue the crew of the SS Pendleton, which has been split in two by a massive storm off the coast of Massachusetts.Story short, they head out, save almost everyone, and return home safe to carry on with their lives. The film starts with the build up of Webber and his future wife Miriam. Sorry to the people who wrote the script, but I'm just not invested in these two. Keep it focused on the rescue mission, stop flashing back to Miriam every 10 minutes. At the end it shows the towns people putting every light they can on to help the survivors home, and we get scenes of multiple people in town other than Miriam and how they feel about their loved ones being in mortal danger, but show more of that. Have scenes of Miriam and how she feels, but make it even with the other family members. Focus a LOT more on the crew members than Miriam is all I'm saying. Other than than I liked Casey Affleck's character. I enjoyed his scenes helping the other crew mates to survive, and was overall invested in them making it through. Overall, a movie I won't watch again. It's not bad, but it's not ""The Founder"" it's not that engaging because the script and the directing ultimately don't know where to go with it. Shame because this true story could be handled so much better.I give it a 6 out of 10"
" The Perfect Storm on steroids
",0.5719,0.949,2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Hey, I didn't realise this was a Disney movie until I read other reviews. That is a statement in itself. Thoroughly enjoyed this actioner, and I have no problem with factual errors as I tend to watch movies for entertainment. If I want to be educated I pick up a book ... or Kindle. OK some of the dialogue was a bit stilted, but it was great to watch a manly film for once. Fine effects and the sound was superb on my soundbar."
" A beautiful well made movie
",0.7184,0.9946,2018-01-19 00:00:00,7,"The Finest Hours: Directed by Craig Gilliespie and written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric JohnsonThis is a based on a true story Disney film, one of the few rated PG-13. Almost none are ever released through the official Disney with the big castle channel with that rating intact. This was a fairly under the radar release. I remember a big standin located just outside of the arcade at my local theater. It looked fascinating from a disaster movie stand point. But this was a bit more than that. It does fit the mold of this type of movie to a T. This could turn a lot of people off but hear me out on this one. This one is different enough. It has the swelling music cues and you know how the arcs of the characters may turn out. Chris Pine is incredible in this movie. He transforms into this character completely. He still looks like Chris Pine but his speech, his body language and his demeanor feel completely Bernie Webber, a stauch rule following meek man. He believes in the system and the way of doing things. His character is the centerpiece of this movie along with Miriam played by actress Holliday Grainger. This is where the movie takes a different route. It is the way the movie opens that really changes how things are perceived when they head out to sea in this crazy storm to rescue the crew members of the Pendleton. The movie opens with a 20 minute scene where Chris Pine and Holliday Grainger meet for the first time. They just talk and reveal bits of themselves. The bar scene then reveals more. The dance hall scene after that reveals the true crux of their relationship. This is not to say that it's the only thing worth mentioning about this well made movie. The effects of the roiling sea and the split ship were incredible. They were so beautifully done that you believed every second of it. The crew on the ship also reveal their ingenuity in trying to stay alive long enough to rescued. This is a solid well made movie. It makes you believe in the situation and feel for the characters. It is beautifully shot and just a really good movie. I give this film a B."
" Effective, old-fashioned disaster drama
",-0.25,0.5106,2018-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Don't be put off by the Disney presence, as THE FINEST HOURS is a refreshingly old fashioned disaster-rescue movie based on a true story. The setting is 1952's Cape Cod, where a tanker is cut in two in a freak accident during a storm and about to sink; a rescue vessel crewed by rookies is tasked with helping to get the men off. The film cuts well between two concurrent plotlines, and of the two, the disaster stuff on the tanker is by far the better. The likes of Casey Affleck and Graham McTavish must use their wits to keep themselves afloat, and the CGI effects do a convincing job of painting the worst possible picture. Back on shore, the reliable Chris Pine and Ben Foster keep you watching, although I could have done without all of the sentimental romantic stuff with a shoehorned-in Holliday Grainger, only there to have the token presence of a woman in the film."
" A Squandered Opportunity **SPOILERS**
",0.4215,0.9925,2017-12-14 00:00:00,2,"QUESTION: Which of these two stories sounds more interesting?(1) A Coast Guardsman has to pilot a tiny boat into the middle of a storm in order to rescue a group of people stranded on a sinking ship.(2) When his ship is caught in a storm and splits in half, the bow sinking and taking with it the entire bridge crew, an ordinary seaman finds a way to jury-rig the stern half of the ship with a manual rudder steered by his surviving shipmates in an all-out effort to drive it to shore.If you're ""The Finest Hours,"" the answer is obvious - the first story.""Wait,"" you may be asking, ""what was that about some guy driving half a ship?""Oh, don't worry about that.Yes, this is the biggest problem with ""The Finest Hours"" - its fatal decision to tell the story from exactly the wrong perspective. It's a decision so bafflingly stupid I can't get my head around it. It completely ruined the film.Chris Pine plays the aforementioned Coast Guard sailor, and his arc takes up most of the running time. He's not a particularly interesting character, yet from the very beginning of the film, we see everything through his eyes. We see him fall in love with his wife in a first act that drags and drags. It lulls the viewer into thinking he's seeing some kind of romance rather than a heart-stopping real-life adventure. The actual plot ends up blindsiding the viewer.It's not until the second act that you really get a chance to meet Casey Affleck, who plays the seaman on the doomed freighter. Right away, we see he's not respected by other members of his crew, and in fact is a bit of a recluse. But when the storm tears apart his ship, he suddenly finds himself thrust into a leadership role. Taking the initiative, we see him come up with an insane plan to drive the broken part of his ship to shore. And, more unbelievably, it actually works - he even manages to beach the ship within sight of land.But the film doesn't care. I'd be generous in saying that it thinks that both Pine and Affleck's characters are equally compelling, but it just isn't true. Pine's story continually interferes with Affleck's, so much so that we miss some of the most interesting moments, such as the trial-and-error that must have happened as Affleck worked out his radical plan. In its place, we have to endure Pine's dull romantic subplot with his anxious wife, as if the story's really about them at the exclusion of everyone else.The ultimate absurdity is that the film seems to become aware that Pine's arc isn't as interesting, and has to reach to make up for it. The defining scenes are when Pine's boat is confronted with a single wave that is his biggest obstacle leaving and returning to the harbor. Both scenes of the wave are slowed down for dramatic effect. But it's laughable when you realize how small his boat is, and thus, how small the wave must be. It just doesn't compare to the borderline superheroics of Affleck's character which - it must be said - involves traveling much further than Pine ever does.Oh, and I forgot to mention - there are actually TWO ships in danger, which is the whole reason Pine gets stuck with the small boat. We don't see what happens on this second ship at all, or the rescue that takes place. Pine's arc makes it completely irrelevant.This film symbolizes a very real problem in America with regard to its hero worship. There's this mistaken belief that a man or woman in uniform doing his duty is every bit as heroic - or more so - than an ordinary person who goes above and beyond the call of duty. And, don't be mistaken, that's exactly what's going on here. Pine may have been dealt a cruddy hand by having to pilot a small boat, but he's just doing his job in going out there. Affleck, on the other hand, could've easily just given up or tried to save himself - after all, none of his shipmates liked him. But he didn't, and he went well above and beyond what was expected of him. Affleck is the true hero of this story - Pine is merely a supporting actor.Think of this in the context of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972) (spoilers ahead on this film, too). Though a fictional film, ""Poseidon"" chooses to focus on the normal passengers who try to fight their way to higher ground in a capsized ship. These Affleck-like characters are the heroes of the story, and everything is told from their view. The Coast Guard has a role as well, but they only arrive in the final minute of the film, after the passengers did 95% of the work in saving themselves. Just because the Coast Guard do dangerous work doesn't mean they're always the heroes. And, guess what - they're not as relateable to a typical audience as people like themselves.This is exactly how ""The Finest Hours"" should have been made. It should have started with Affleck on the ship and stayed with him for the entire film. We should've learned more about him, why he is the way he is, and why the others don't respect him. We should've seen every moment of his unbelievable courage, and wondered moment by moment if he would succeed. You can still put Pine in the story, but have him show up as one final obstacle. Think of the drama where, after all Affleck does, we discover that the only ship that reaches them is one too small to save everyone. Unbelievable! That would've been such a tremendous reveal and really added depth and action to the story.Who's to blame? Well, the writers, of course. How could they not have seen this? Maybe they wanted to show the heroics of both sides, but really, when you look at the story, the characters just aren't equal. The story demands better than what they gave it. A simple script revision would've fixed this. It's clear such revisions weren't attempted, and they rushed the first draft of the script. For shame.It may seem silly to criticize a film based on real events, but that doesn't mean there's only one way to present it. And if one-half of your story is vastly more interesting than the second half, why not feature it more? At the end of the day, big-budget films like this are entertainment, and you have to put your best foot forward.Two out of ten stars for Affleck's awesomeness, proportionate to how little of it the film lets you see."

The acting was excellent and the story line was inspiring. I definitely recommend this movie.

The actors, direction and whole production is excellent.The only negative is the female ""love"" interest who is mainly an irritation and to me is wholly unnecessary in the movie. Despite that, I can still say this is a highly exciting and entertaining thoughtful show deserving at least:8/10."

Though the events are based on reality the plot feels heavily scripted and the characters blown out of proportion. This, however, does not by any means hurt the film. Truth be told nothing in this movie, apart from maybe the score, actually under performs enough to make the film bad or mediocre. The actors play their parts well, certain shots are quite interesting and the film has a certain visual charm once you get used to the rain and darkness. It's just that nothing is truly... great.The rescue of the survivors of the SS Pendleton is an interesting story and the movie is a nice homage to the heroes and their actions. That's what the film set out to be and that's what it is."
" A Poorly Made Film About a Great Story
",0.6249,-0.7182,2017-10-15 00:00:00,6,"I was so looking forward to watching this movie. I'd heard the comments about all the nominations for awards and so it has been on my most wanted list.Chris Pine is one of my favourite (English/Australian spelling) actors, as is Casey Affleck, and that big Scot, Graham McTavish, what a real let down from Game of Thrones and Outlander for him.It was such a shame to see so many great performers being undervalued by lousy direction. Every element for a terrific suspense filled drama was there waiting for the right direction and timing. Instead we got left with all the high drama being dawdled up to and then let slide down the other side with a whimper. Even the music score was no help. Chris Pine looked like he just wanted to sleep and I can understand that it probably was his frustration with the director. He had next-to-nothing to do. Into The Storm this wasn't, but it could have been and maybe even better. Too bad, so sad."
" Not a good movie
",-0.3412,0.571,2017-08-28 00:00:00,2,This is not a good movie. It's pretty long and boring. I only give it 2 points because of the special effects. The perfect storm which is another disaster movie is 10 times better than this. This movie has too many jargons that left the viewers not knowing what's happening half the time.
" what works and what doesn't
",0.0,0.9896,2017-08-10 00:00:00,7,"Over all it was worth watching as an evening entertainment. The true story is very compelling on its own, with little added drama. I did not find the side story of Bernie and Miriam's ""love"" story to add to the theme, and in fact it was annoying. I understand they were already in fact married when this even occurred, and the writers should have gone with that. They frankly made Miriam out to be childish, not gutsy, having her run her car into the snow bank... what for? I am sure that didn't happen. They were trying to make her into some sort of proactive feminist and they bombed. Chris Pine did a good job, but he was too handsome for the part. They were playing up ""sexy"" and that was not a good choice. Chris Pine did a pretty good job of being a simple honest guy, but in the body of a sex symbol??? why? The actors of the ships crew were really compelling.. I think the writers tried to do a Titanic re-make instead of telling the real story which is interesting enough. I did find the movie to have good moments, but it wasn't brilliant. That was the writers fault, they could have been more true to the event and it would have been more interesting."
" The Finest Hours Lifts You Up Honourably
",0.0,0.9956,2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,"This is somewhat of a modern milestone for a Hollywood-style movie. A gut-wrenching story based on a daring, factually based, historic sea rescue. The screenplay, written by Award nominated Scot Silver along with Eric Johnson & Paul Tamasy proves a strong point - that a powerful story can be told without resorting to the now 'trendy' course language - making it an all age spectacular. And, spectacular it is indeed. Based on Michael J.Tougias and co-author Casey Sherman's book of the same name, this exciting story literally dumps the viewer into a tiny Coast Guard rescue boat as it's being pounded by the most deadly seas of all.Even though the CGI folk have overdone certain effects - some of the angry ocean scenes are often so convincing they leave you wanting to grab a towel to dry off or even check your life jacket is handy! A strong hand picked stellar cast convince all the way, while Chris Pine and Casey Affleck put in hard working performances as the heroic Coast Guard pilot and the engineer of a stricken cargo giant - that's been torn in two by massive winds and seas. Cynical viewers who have been seduced by hard-edged 'modern' scripts - need to be reminded that love in the 1950's moved at a slower, more thoughtful pace than the soulless in-your-face situations we see in movies today.Photographically, The Finest Hours features stylish visuals by Spanish born D.O.P. Javier Aguirresarobe and the well-paced FX are all brought together with some neat direction by Australian Craig Gillespie - along with a Carter Burwell score. The atmospheric end title song 'Haul Away Joe' performed by Kodaline caps it off nicely (not to mention all those remarkable 50s cars!). All up it's refreshing, quite believable, high voltage entertainment, for those who want more than the comic book situations we get thrown at us all too often. This one definitely deserves more attention and is recommended for a good night's inspirational entertainment - that most audiences should enjoy."

Totally distracting and annoying. Is it just me or is there anyone on the same page about this???

I also felt that there's should have been more set-up about the background story to this plot.

" Looking similar movies to Perfect Storm? Then this is the right choice!
",0.6114,0.9878,2017-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Yes. First thing first, like I said on the tittle, if you are looking good old and well made disaster movies, you WILL like this. Especially this one is almost ""identical"" movie to Perfect Storm. Both tells the true story about accident on the sea.But about this movie. It is true story of oil tanker, SS Pendleton, which broke into half near of east-coast of USA. This accident happened in 1952, so the movie and milieu is just like that. Like you really can see that like cars and clothing really is old. The crew manage to keep half of the ship on surface and soon Coast Guards hears about the accident, they'll have to do what they have to do. The weather is worst possible but they will start the massive rescue operation with small crew - and with the small rescue boat.The storm and the filming in the sea is really well made. It looks real and you really can feel that you are also in the middle of the storm. Acting is also very good.There still was couple things that took away those 2 stars. And that was the woman, and such a clich√© love story behind it. Well, this IS the production of Disney after all.. What can you expect.But if looking the big picture, this movie is totally worth of watching! It's really hard to say which one I would pick if I must choose between The Finest Hours and the Perfect Storm! I recommend both! These offers amazing experience of moments of disaster on the sea."
" Storm at sea, really not my thing, but nice movie
",0.5719,0.9819,2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"The fact that the movie is based on true events makes it a bit more special to watch. It's a nice story about courageous coast guards that risk their own lives trying to save an entire ship crew from a sure death. The movie is well made and if you are like me a bit afraid of big storms at sea then you will have the same feeling of anguish as I had during almost the entire movie. There are some cheesy moments as well, when it's more about their romance, but for the rest it's a good movie. If it was not for a couple scenes that I didn't like I would score it even more. Those scenes were unrealistic and bothered me a bit. Scenes where they are at sea in a major storm and have a conversation on a non rocking boat. That is simply impossible, but for the rest it's all good. Good actors, good story, and interesting due to it's historical facts."
" Nostalgia at its best
",0.6369,0.9886,2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"I am rather disappointed by all the negative and meh reviews about this film so I am chiming in with my two cents, for what its worth.Chris Pine was the hook that drew me into this selection when it popped up on Netflix. The movie starts with a romance that is refreshing in that the woman who captures the heart of the lead is rather pushy and a bit more assertive than we'd expect for the time period. It was a neat twist and I rather enjoyed watching Chris Pine's character tangle and be entranced by such a woman.After the love angle is squared away, the story turns to the heroic true story of Bernie Webber. Which, upon checking further into that story, I found it is definitely a tale worth telling and surprisingly the film doesn't stray too far from the facts.The film is a mixture of The Perfect Storm and Hacksaw Ridge. The perfect storm angle is that there are two tankers in distress during a big winter storm at the same time. The report of the foundering of one tanker is mistaken for the other. With all resources aimed at saving the first of the two tankers, the rescue of the crew of the second is left to Bernie Webber and the single remaining too small coast guard ship in the marina.The Hacksaw Ridge angle is that there is something so real about the people in this film--a real humanity to them. Also, there is a mixture of dignity, humility, strength and integrity in all of the characters and its not something I've seen in a film or on the page in a very long time. For me film was very nostalgic. Bernie Webber , as played by Chris Pine, reminded me of my father in many ways as well as all the men I knew and admired as a small girl. The story reminds of a time when people did the things they did simply because it was the right thing to do and did these wondrous things with humility and a quiet strength.Best scene....Webber's hands shaking upon taking the helm to try and return to shore.For these reasons alone, its a film worth seeing."
" Inspiring movie and FAMILY friendly!
",0.7424,0.9799,2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"I was surprised Walt Disney still produced a quality movie. Our whole family enjoyed it. We especially liked the fact that it was based on a true story. Folks kept their clothes and and every other word wasn't F this and F that. Self reliance and individuality was stressed instead of this over sensitivity and relying on group think. What some may not like is the respect shown towards rules and knowing when to over rule the rules. Gender roles are clear and defined i.e. women are women and men are men. Gasp,they even allowed praying in those days! It's the America we need to get back to in stead of this third world anything goes mentality. If you were not aware of the plot, you really couldn't predict the ending. There was suspense and the special effects were pretty good. It was very enjoyable. Thank you Disney! Produce more like this and we'll come back to being Disney fans."
" Out of respect for these men....
",0.4767,0.9792,2017-02-01 00:00:00,10,"If you read the history of this story and couple that with the quality of acting as well as the time and money that has gone into making this movie, it seems disrespectful that over 40,000 voters would give this picture less than 7 out of 10 stars rating. Excellent story and movie and acting. 10 stars as a means of correcting any previous disrespect.Both Casey Affleck and Chris Pine do a phenomenal job of acting. The harrowing scenes are breathtaking. A good piece of history to restore anyone's faith in humanity. Treat yourself to an important history lesson and good-old-fashioned entertainment.The greatest small boat rescue in history which happened in 1952....just over 64 years ago."
" Absolutely average in every single way.
",0.0,0.986,2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"The Finest Hours (2016) is absolutely average in every single way. Nothing in this movie was terrible, yet nothing exceeds the norm. The acting isn't really good, but it is certainly passable. The direction isn't memorable, but there is a distinctive mark left when it comes to the visual style. The special effects were very practical and convincing. The story is probably the most compelling part and is the only thing I found to be truly remarkable. Without that astounding real-life story, this would be nothing more than a run-of-the-mill rescue film. It was an entertaining watch and I wasn't bored throughout it. This is a story worth hearing about, but a movie worth watching when you've run out of movies to see on Netflix. Nothing more, nothing less."
