" Saoirse delivers an Oscar worthy performance in Brooklyn
",0.4404,0.5719,2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"When a young Irish immigrant lands in 1950s Brooklyn, she finds a life and navigates in a new land. Wonderful story ."
" Overrated
",0.0,0.5818,2021-03-13 00:00:00,1,I am shocked that this film received so many awards nomination and awards. I watched this film after seeing good reviews. While watching the film eilis 's character did get on my nerves. I don't enjoy the film if i start hating the main character. She is selfish and cheating girl. How can someone possibly like her. I don't know how this film is categorize as love story. This is not love. She never loved any of them .if she have loved her husband then should would never cheat. If she loved the another man she should be truthful with him. I don't know why people support such kind of films.

Then she went back to Ireland for a month because her sister died. In this month she caught up with old friends, and met a charming guy from childhood. Got threatened(?) by the old lady from the grocery store when she was about to cheat on her newly married husband, and then she went back to Brooklyn. Well, sorry, I'm not so into this kind of stories even though they made it looks beautiful :) The Italian guy's 8-year-old brother is the cutest."
" Eh, It's a bit overrated
",0.0,0.9615,2021-02-09 00:00:00,6,"The movie was very nice, but the problem is, it's toooooooooo short.
The plot is very simple, she wanted to work there. She met a guy loved him but then she had to go back and met another guy and loved him but wait she eventually chooses the first one. That's the whole movie seriously. Yeah it was nice and I don't really expect much more of such a story and it wasn't really emotional to be honest."
" Overly cliche, dry, and mundane
",0.0,0.4866,2021-01-11 00:00:00,5,"After watching Little Women and Ladybird featuring Saorise Ronan, I cannot count how many times i have searched her up on google. With high hopes for this movie, it left me feeling me empty and lost for the ending. This is not Saorise Ronan's fault, she accurately depicted her character's emotions, rather the STORYLINE and PLOT'S PROBLEM with making it CLICHE AND PREDICTABLE. I kept hoping for a twist at the end, and maybe this wasn't a waste of time, there was none."
" Beautiful and relatable film
",0.5994,0.9698,2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"What a beautiful and relatable film, I can relate to it as a relatively young person (26) who has experienced moving to and living in a new country. Whilst the film is set in the 50's, in an era where communication was not as instant as it is today, it speaks of the raw emotions, pain, joy and journey of growth that one goes through when moving to a new place. Eilis - Saoirse Ronan's acting speaks for itself. It is moving and utterly beautiful. I am in awe of the whole movie. It also made me feel and understand what it was like for my parents and other immigrants to move to a new country when letter writing and telephone calls were the main mode of communication, when travel was less frequent and distances were greater, and begin to understand what it must have been like for them to leave lives, parents and families behind to begin a new life in a country they would grow to call home. I love this movie and I will watch it again."
" Ronan and Cohen are super...
",0.0,0.9973,2020-12-23 00:00:00,7,"Saoirse Ronan is a young Irish girl who emigrates to America in the 1950s. She arrives knowing nobody, but fortunately finds work in an upmarket department store whilst lodging with a reputable lady (Julie Walters). She meets the gorgeous Emory Cohen (""Tony"") who has dreams of starting his own construction company, his idealism empowers her own personality and their life seems set fair. Suddenly, however, she must return to Ireland to deal with some family matters and her character faces a myriad of choices as she must try to reconcile the old with the new - and Domhnall Gleeson (""Jim"" ) only further complicates an already intricately balanced scenario. That scenario, in itself, is nothing new or complex - it's the stunningly delicate, charming and powerful performance from Ronan that shines brightly, here. She - as does Cohen - acts with the eye; the expression - both deliver nuanced performances that depict the best of human nature despite plenty of pressures - distance, family, gossiping neighbours etc. that could easily compromise the integrity of their personalities. Gleeson is also good, as is Walters who provides a gentle, but crucial anchor for the young stranger in Brooklyn. The overall look of the film is engagingly authentic and Michael Brook's score provides a delightful accompaniment to this stylish and captivating adaptation of Colm Tóibín's story of optimism, determination and love."
" Saiorse Ronan makes you forget the cliché
",-0.2263,0.9973,2020-12-17 00:00:00,8,"Many would probably be sceptical about this 2015 book adaptation by director John Crowley after reading the premise for the first time. A young, inexperienced woman from a small town in Ireland travels to the big and scary America where, after an initial rough road, she later meets the love of her life. Sounds like a classic tearjerker, but is much more than that due to its enormous depth and an outstanding leading actress.Saoirse Ronan almost single-handedly manages to put the cliché of the gushy romance to rest early on in the film. She starts off as an enormously shy newcomer who doesn't really know where she stands in life and in the social hierarchy. As she progresses, as she is able to confide in more and more people, she becomes more confident and also more extroverted in a very discreet way. This makes her performance very versatile and prompts one to follow her development closely throughout the film. Emory Cohen delivers a very emotional performance as the man by her side, but sometimes he falls into that very cliché of exuberance. Often his presence next to Ronan also seems rather indifferent, which is of course also due to her strong performance. Their chemistry is very natural in many moments and seems very real to you, but also somewhat unbalanced at times.Brooklyn starts off enormously well and is never really boring despite its simple plot. Yes, the film takes a lot of time in some scenes, but that is exactly what is needed to understand the romance and above all the protagonists tug-of-war. It is not only a coming of age and love story, but also reveals the contrast between two completely different cultures, namely life in the big New York and in the small Irish town where everybody knows and talks about everybody. For this, the film could well have been longer than 107 minutes. Towards the end, a lot of action is packed into a relatively short period of time, which makes the ending rather rushed. If this had been handled a little better, Brooklyn would have been a romantic masterpiece. As it is, however, it is a very beautiful film that is much more than a simple romance."
" It is a beautiful film but...
",0.5994,0.9886,2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed the film for its escapism & the final feel good factor.
The era it was filmed in was excellently done, the hair, the costumes etc.
I fell in love with the main character, she was pretty & I love her accent, though she might not be as honest & true as we would have hoped or expected.
Talk about the luck of the Irish, she must have found a four leaf clover or something, if the lottery existed in those days, then she would have surely won the jackpot, she was so damn lucky, as everything fell into place for her.
A special mention to Julie Walters who was exceptional as the landlady of the boarding house."
" waste of time, overrated.
",-0.4215,-0.3182,2020-11-07 00:00:00,2,"Every here and there I feel that watching a film was a complete waste of time.
The only feeling Brooklyn left me with, was this."
" Excellent Period Pic
",0.5719,0.9476,2020-10-10 00:00:00,9,The casting for this film was excellent. Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen really shined IMO. Google Play Movies gave me a couple of $0.99 rentals and I am extremely pleased that I chose to redeem one to watch this movie. It's 5 years old and hasn't popped up on any of the streaming services or cable channels I subscribe to. My guess is that it has fared so well based on word of mouth reviews that there hasn't been a need to move away from the direct online rental/purchase business model. If you have a few bucks laying around and are looking for something enjoyable to watch you can't go wrong with this one.
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.8481,2020-09-29 00:00:00,8,"Nice atmosphere, well played. Old fashioned good movie."
" Immy's review : Delightful
",0.5859,0.9971,2020-09-01 00:00:00,9,"A wonderful little movie about a young Irish woman who immigrates to America and deals with the emotional turmoil of leaving her old life behind. The film explores the themes of isolation, familiarity and what we consider home. Firstly, the movie has an incredibly warm, inviting and down to earth atmosphere, delivering a heartwarming tale about our strong attachments to home, and the conflicting obligations that may pull us towards two different countries. This was largely helped by Saiorse Ronan's incredible performance, portraying the plain yet humble Eilis. She perfectly captures the essence of her warm and familiar character, as we can all see a part of us inside her. When Eilis arrives in America, she first struggles to adjust and is bewildered by the unfamiliar city and faces, perfectly conveying the grief and emptiness that comes along with feeling homesick. However, Eilis slowly begins forming new connections and relationships, consequently creating a new life for herself and realising that Brooklyn is beginning to feel like home. It's for this reason that the movie wins us over, as it resonates with so many of us who have been in the same situation, and perfectly portrays the different stages we encounter as we create a new life for ourselves. I love how the film conveys to us how easily a once strange and unfamiliar place can become something so significant because of the people we find there. Eilis character development was subtle yet powerful, as we see her become a stronger, more confident woman who is not so afraid of change anymore. This was well portrayed through the cinematography, which later on presented everything around Eilis in a bigger, bolder light, thus conveying she had adopted a more diverse view of the world, no longer being confined to the familiarity of Ireland. I really loved when Eilis went home for her sisters funeral, and upon returning, realised what she had missed and all of the opportunities that had arisen from her old life, leaving her conflicted and having to choose between the two places. The side characters were fabulous, especially Tony who was incredibly likeable and romantic, and Domhnall Gleeson, who breaks our hearts with his love for Eilis, and his complete lack of knowledge that she was married, ultimately being let down in the end. This moral dilemma was necessary in making Eilis finally realise that Ireland is no longer her home, and that she can't just cling onto someone because of their familiarity. We sympathise with Eilis rather than despising her, as we relate to her feelings of wanting to be close to those who are from our own country or background, and it's how we feel attached to home. However, the movie teaches wholeheartedly to move forward, to not be afraid of new opportunities in our lives, and that home can be anywhere you want it to be. Overall, a delightful and heartwarming tale focused on the universal theme of leaving home, and the problems that arise with it. The storytelling was simple yet powerful, and ultimately created a wonderful experience. Highly recommend!"
" 1st Part vs. 2nd Part(Minor Spoilers, Some Might Consider No Spoiler)
",-0.296,0.9749,2020-08-29 00:00:00,6,"Saoirse Ronan's performance was fabulous and the cast was good overall. I really liked the first part of the movie, the conflict was simple(immigrating and adapting to USA) but well executed. The second part was really mixed. In the 2nd part you realize that the conflict hasn't appeared yet which completely changes the first part of the movie. You could even say that the first part had its own climax at the end, but because of how the 2nd part progresses; the 1st part becomes just a setup. The 1st part just sets up the character, which might sound okay but because of that the later part of the movie feels rushed. The side characters in the first part are totally different with the ones in 2nd part which results in the movie setting up different characters, and the climax arrives at the end and resolves rather quickly like it is in a hurry. Domhnall Gleeson's character is the same as Tony so it doesn't add anything to the story. Eilis is an interesting character but I can't say the same for other characters. They are all superficial and not developed at all. Still a good movie, could have been great with a few minor changes."
" Beautiful and passionate...
",0.5994,0.9639,2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"Guys, how beautiful and passionate this film is, so much delicacy, consumed me in love and longing ... And I cried your pains as if mine were, so simple, painful, beautiful and fun, a graceful and very well produced dramatic novel, photography , the costumes take us back to the 60s and recreates a beautiful, nostalgic and charming time ... Only the pain she inflicted on her mother was too unfair ..."
" Overrated
",0.0,-0.6921,2020-06-13 00:00:00,2,It starts off slowly. It proceeds at a pedestrian pace. It appears to be going somewhere. Then it goes nowhere. Then it ends. In the end I was left feeling it was a complete waste of time. The characters are not well drawn. Elis does things that are boring and other things that are inexplicable. The only interesting character was the small town gossip. In a word: boring.
" Another overrated movie
",0.0,0.9475,2020-05-06 00:00:00,6,"I just watched the movie. To be honest I didn't like the story. Lead character is very inconsistent, you don't go out dancing with your friends when you just lost your sister and while your mother is mourning for example. Also immigration process and starting a new life in a new country has very dramatic effects in your life which you won't see any of these in this one.
Fully cloth on sex scene was completely ridiculous. If the director too scared to shot a regular love making scene, it can be skipped rather than having your characters having sex fully clothed for the first time.
They used ""the year's best love story"" quote from rolling stone but believe me even twilight is better love story than this one. It was boring and unnecessary but not a bad movie at the same time."
" Not quite what I expected
",0.0,0.8184,2020-04-03 00:00:00,6,"I've always put off watching this film - perhaps it's timing. It seems there are far too many movies and shows which somehow glorify (or at least vindicate) having affairs and I feared this would be much the same so avoided it. I was half right. It is a love story, beautifully acted, which left me shouting at my tele on more than one occasion questioning what will happen all the way through. Are the people really this nice? Do they have ulterior motives? Will she go back to the man who very clearly loves her? (gosh, I hope so!). It's enjoyable enough but have to say, I'm not sure it was worth the hysteria."
" Boring
",-0.3182,-0.6705,2020-03-31 00:00:00,4,"This film is just plain boring. Takes forever to get to the main storyline, just wasted 2 hours of my life."
" Cinematic excellence
",0.6249,0.9851,2020-03-25 00:00:00,9,"Brooklyn is a wonderful movie that captures how it felt like to live in the Brooklyn many years back. It tells the story of love and adapting life after immigrating to America. It's emotional, it's laughable, it's makes you feel so great and happy. It feels very nostalgic in a very good way and I throughly felt true joy from it."

",0.0,-0.3612,2020-03-22 00:00:00,8,"The scenery along the way has been changing, leaving traces at every step we take, we can go forward, but it is difficult to turn back. Therefore, when accustomed to the original strange environment, it is the second ""home""."
" Cute and heartfelt, but lacking any real antagonist or conflict.
",-0.5499,0.6903,2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Cute and heartfelt, but lacking any real antagonist or conflict, other than the strange amount of opportunity both in Ireland and in America. While this film does a good job to tug at your heartstrings every once in a while, the main thing it really does is convince you that Domhnall Gleeson was in absolutely EVERYTHING last year."
" ok

" Great film with a great flaw
",0.8481,0.9974,2019-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Many people enjoy a good period piece with great actors and a good overall story. Brooklyn did extremely well at the BO for an indie. I will see anything with Saorise Ronan ever since Hanna, but the ending left me cold. It could have been easily remedied but perhaps the writer was tapping into a true story and could not veer from the facts, even though based on a novel.No critic I read had anything but praise for Brooklyn and I enjoyed it enough to see it in the theater twice, but it does have a serious problem. Ellis played by Ronan is the feminist heroine daring to be different and go against her mother's wishes and local customs by moving to America. She wants to have a better life and America is the land of opportunity. She falls in love with a boy she meets at a dance in Brooklyn. The boy urges her to marry him before she goes back to Ireland to attend a funeral. He does not want to risk losing her. She does not want to rush into the marriage but does so anyway. They marry secretly.In Ireland she gets a part time job bookkeeping (a skill she was trained for in the USA) and very much enjoys it. Her work is appreciated and Ireland is looking much better to her. A wealthy, good-looking man takes her out to dinner and then falls in love with her. She falls in love with him. She never tells anyone she is married but leads the man to believe she is considering marriage and a new home with him. She is apparently planning on becoming a bigamist when someone finds out she is already married. We get a speech from her about small-minded people in small towns and how nothing has really changed there. She decides to go back to Brooklyn and stay with husband number one. Ellis does not really have a choice, does she? She recognizes that she will be utterly rejected by everyone when they find out. The director uses several tricks to keep us from thinking about this problem, such as her letter of explanation we are never allowed to read.She is not a heroine because she was never honest. There was nothing wrong with the locals thinking she was a schemer and a shrew for never telling anyone the truth about her marriage and lack of availability. We are spared by the director from seeing the damage done to her new, prospective husband who was very much in love with her. So, it is a bittersweet tale.I accepted the story line at first because she was young and naive but that flies in the face of praising her as a ground-breaking and brave feminist."
" A movie, to the foreigners away home.

You gotta figure all out one way or the other. And you probably meet someone who will be part of your future life... What need to be afraid of is, better offers are given when everything just settled down. Stay with or leave? No matter which decision you make, someone let down anyway."
" Nostalgia and the hope for a new life
",0.4404,0.9827,2019-10-30 00:00:00,7,"Nostalgia is a feeling most immigrants must have experienced sooner or later. In this tale, Irish girl Eilis moves to Brooklyn hoping for a better life. She has left her beloved sister Rose at home. Also her mum, but there's not much space for filial love in this plot.After an indefinite time of loneliness and nostalgia, quiet girl Eilis starts to get involved with the Irish expats community and during a dance meets Italian boy Tony.Turns out, the solution to nostalgia is nothing more complicated than a love story. However, back home tragedy strikes and Eilis must go back to support her mum, after the unexpected death of Rose.This part of the plot is a bit thin, as Eilis does not seem to care much for her mum. She is out an about in no time, with nice guy Jim, double dating with her best friend and her fiancé.At this stage, Eilis must decide between the old (and reassuring) and the new (and exciting). Will the power of her roots and nostalgia win the game? Her future will be very different, according to her choice.Ronan is a great interpreter and the movie is carried by her performance. Also nice to see for once a female main character who is not bubbly, aggressive of slutty, like in most contemporary movies."
" What is that thing we call home?
",0.0,-0.7959,2019-10-25 00:00:00,5,"I hated the carachter, I couldn't accept her behaviours. She was never sure about loving tony. It seemed like it's the best chance for her at that time then why not?
This appears when she met Jem, she get confused that she doesn't reply Tony's messages and starts to give Jem promises while she is already married!
Then she simply leave saying that she is married.
I couldn't accept such action. If someone is not sure about his decisions, feelings, or himself, he must never give a promise to someone else..
The other people also have feelings and this is called ""messing up""."
" Italians in the film
",0.0,0.9085,2019-10-23 00:00:00,6,"As an Italian I can say that the Italians in this film don't look at all Italian, especially Ronan's love interest.
Scrolling the cast they haven't got Italian surnames.
One little kid has an Italian surname, he uses Italian gestures but not in the right way.
They drink milk at the table. No Italian would ever dream of drinking milk at the table.
My point is that if you get Irish (or British) actors to play the Irish you might as well get Italian-Americans to play the Italians. If you do things do them right..."
" A Damn Good Movie
",0.0516,0.9231,2019-09-11 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed Brooklyn thoroughly. The 2 leads and especially Saoirse Ronan are excellent. You'll laugh, you'll cry. Romantic and heartwarming."
" Interesting Movie
",0.4019,-0.8296,2019-08-15 00:00:00,7,"Just think about Eilis's mother, how is she gonna live the rest of her life and how's she gonna bear the neighbourhoodEilis made too many mistakes.Should have never married Tony just before leaving. She was having sex and getting married in NYC while her sister's funeral was going on in Ireland. She didn't think once about her mother before making the decision.Then she didn't tell her mother about the marriage staright away after reaching Ireland.Then she started ignoring Tony and romancing Jim despite being in a wedlock.Then she made the final decision in desperation and out of emotions after Miss Kelly told her about the letter. She should have bombed the bad out of Miss Kelly for interfering in her personal affairs.All in all, I would say Eilis wasn't a wise girl and that she made many selfish decisions. On the other hand, her big sister was a true role-model. The movie seemed very real.... very close to our real social behaviours..."

So if you like Hallmark Movies, you sure would love this Movie.The Acting is very good and the story is rather nice and calm.Not 10 Stars because there are definitely better Movies out there, but you can see and feel why it has been nominated for 3 Academy Awards."
" Inconsistent
",0.0,-0.7422,2019-08-11 00:00:00,5,"This is a pretty, glossy picture that makes a good popcorn movie. I haven't read the novel, so I can't comment on the movie as an adaptation of it. As a standalone work, I enjoyed it up until Eilis married Tony, which imo seemed out of character for her as she had been portrayed up until that point. The way that she carried on the pretence of being single until confronted by the horrible Miss Kelly also seemed contrived to me, and the very feeble reaction of Eilis's mother to her confession of being married highly unrealistic. I can see Eilish agreeing to marry Tony as a way of cementing her newly attained social status by giving her a reason to return to New York. But I don't understand why she didn't tell her mother or her best friend about Tony, or why her mother didn't probe for answers or get angry when she finally broke down. The way the situation resolved itself at the end just seemed too slick and easy to me, and I couldn't help judging Eilis for fleeing Ireland under a cloud of scandal and throwing her mother to the village wolves with the gossip. I couldn't reconcile this girl with the prim, conservative young lady we were shown at the beginning. I know people change, but the change in Eilis was too sudden and too drastic for me to find it believable, and this unfortunately ruined the movie for me."
" Superficial
",0.0,0.6243,2019-07-26 00:00:00,1,So looking forward to this movie but goodness me so superficial and complete lack of depth of characters. You cared about no one really and the final scene you hoped a car would cause some drama but no. The scene of of Frankie's 'song' and young Freddie's contribution shone the only light in this movie. The interesting Australian film Ladies in Black handled similar issues with so much more panache and care. Sadly awful.
" from the Emerald Isle to the land of dreams
",0.4019,0.9892,2019-07-19 00:00:00,10,"I heard about ""Brooklyn""'s release in 2015-2016, but due to my life situation at the time (it's a long story) I never got around to seeing it. I finally have. What an experience. There have been a lot of movies about immigrants and about Ireland - there could be an entire college course focusing on either of these - but I think that this particular film deserves special recognition. The story and performances are the main strength, but there's also the moral issue that the movie address (loyalty to one's roots vs. one's future).In the lead role of Eilis, Saoirse Ronan has the role of a lifetime. We all loved her performances in ""Hanna"" and ""Lady Bird"", but this will probably go down as her greatest one. Which is not to subtract from her co-stars. Everyone puts in their best efforts here and it shows. Without a doubt, this is a movie for the ages. A true credit to Ireland.As to the issue of whether or not it should've won any of the Oscars for which it got nominated, we can debate that forever. I'd say that every nominee that year had its merits."
" Should've been titled Eilies instead of Brooklyn
",0.0,0.9538,2019-07-12 00:00:00,4,"Based on the title I thought its a deep movie.. But it's a just a simple romance movie.. It's not deep enough to show all the struggles of her trying to start her life in a new country.. Everything is being planned for her.. The only struggle is the homesick.. The romance between her and Tony felt loose.. It feels like Jim is a better guy for her.. Her character is inconsistent.. In earlier part of the movie she is shown as a reasonable, kind and sweet person.. But suddenly she is mean to the new girl..and refused to reply her husband's letters.. The one who she hastily married.. And all of a sudden she realised she wants to choose him and leave her mother after she found out that Miss Kelly knows about the marriage..that's it..

Quality acting of this type doesn't come along too often these days and the cast does a really good job of pulling your heartstrings.
It's so nice to see wholesome people on the screen again,
(especially Italian/American guys) and it shows you how much we've been battered over the head with bad guys, that you're on the edge of your seat waiting to find out when things go wrong.It is, above all, a sweet and redemptive movie and it's not at all about Brooklyn
(the title was one of the reasons I watched it, because I recently spent a couple of miserable months there).
There's not much Brooklyn actually in the scenes (thank goodness), it's more a story of the frailty of love when distance is involved.A very pleasant production and if you're in any way inclined to shed a tear over lost love then this will be for you .. sniffle sniffle."

She is able to make a living and meets a man she wants to marry when the sudden death of her sister forces her to return to her lonely mother in Ireland. Once there, she is introduced to a charming Irish man, who soon falls in love with her and forces her to take a tough decision.In some elements, this movie is great. The intensity with which it describes this young woman being torn apart over two men is amazing and deeply touching. A beautiful acting does the rest to draw you into the story. Unfortunately a lot of the other elements of the movie are very much Hollywood and all in all look a bit too clean for my taste. It's maybe the will to tell a great cineastic tale that prevents a sense of nasty and brutal realism that could have added additional depth.All in all this still is one of the better Blockbuster movies. It has a story to tell, convinces with good casting choices and a touching dilemma. A bit less clean and this could have been even more than that."

However, the story is solid and sweet, and about real people... Not idealized people and situations, as so many romantic movies are.The characters are endearing, and I felt a real connection to them. Like most of us in North America our relatives and ancestors came from elsewhere, and in some cases not so long ago - so although I am a third-generation North American, this story was still very close to me.It's absolutely beautifully shot.

I didn't mind that the lead character didn't face many challenges and that overall everyone around her was kind as other reviewers have commented. I didn't even mind that the main protagonist, her ex-employer in Ireland was hardly a protagonist at all.
But what niggled at me in the latter half of the movie was the Main character's suddenly spineless uncharacteristic slippery slope into having an emotional affair with another man and toying with his emotions and ignoring her husbands letters when they had gone to such great lengths to build her character in the beginning as one of such fine moral standing, kindness and gentleness. Even more so that the slippery slope was a steep one taking place less than a full month after she had just been married in Brooklyn? That part of the storyline felt weak and uncomfortable.
That said, visually the movie was beautiful, most of the characters were likeable and it was a nice way to while away 90 minutes of an afternoon."

" A movie everyone should see.
",0.0,0.998,2018-11-29 00:00:00,10,"This is a story told beautifully with breath-taking shots, and powerful characters, the movie Brooklyn, a relatable, passionate drama, embodies great contrast between life in Ireland and America when the character Eilis Lacey immigrated to Brooklyn, New York for opportunities that weren't available for her in 1950's Ireland.This journey to self discovery was one with parts everyone can relate to. The choice to stay in the comfort of your own home, family, and culture or to jump into a life of uncertainty, but potential success was portrayed beautifully by the actress Saoirse Ronan. The actresses real connection to Ireland, being born and raised there and extraordinary acting of a witty, timid, but courageous Irish woman created an irreplaceable authenticity.The director, John Crowley, intensified the viewers relationship with the Character with long shots of Eilis with her pale skin and Irish red hair showing silently strong emotion. Just in time, when her homesickness is at her peak, she falls for Tony Fiorello, an American-Italian man that lifts her spirits in a magically pleasant relationship made this way through beautiful shots, and color arrangements leaving you wanting more.The story shifts when she was greeted with terrible news that changes her life and forces her to make difficult decisions. This event forced her to visit home, and when she gets there, it wasn't what it was for her before she left. She arrived to new opportunities that weren't there before, a new job, even a new man. This was emphasized by beautiful shots of Ireland colors, and beaches that weren't shown before she left. As she remembered what her home was like, she came to a realization that home can be made anywhere including Brooklyn, where she would go back to the open arms of her lover, Tony.Although there is this heart-warming love story, it's more than that. It shows that both men she meets in Brooklyn and Ireland are suitable for her, as well as both, America and Ireland are suitable for her but the choice is completely in her hands making this movie unlike other love stories. It's not a story about soulmates and her not being able to live without the other, it's her choosing a life that she wants. Something that wasn't normal for her in the beginning of the film, when she was uncertain in herself and in the future that was chosen for her.The last scene of her on the boat going back to Brooklyn showed hope, and confidence in her future. She grew into an outspoken independent women and saw that, making the decision to go to Brooklyn much easier. This movie is an eye-opening look to see how things have changed then compared to today. It let's us step back into a time where we didn't have everything like communication and knowledge right at our fingertips. Overall, Brooklyn is a coming of age story of a girl gaining confidence and security within herself. The theme of finding home in any place is understood and has been experienced by just about everyone."

" Sap, Reality, and Grit are Relative
",0.0,0.9977,2018-09-21 00:00:00,7,"There are different ways to judge a movie. Is it absolutely necessary for every film to be totally ""real?"" Or are there different niches in the market for different people?For someone who wants something less sappy than a Hallmark production, but not as a gritty or cynical as The Sopranos, Brooklyn may hit the spot. I've read several comments discussing the lack of edge or character development. They are correct, but perhaps some people just want to see a sweet coming-of-age love story without too much grit and gristle. Should they be denied options that fit their taste?Having said that, there are some pros and cons worth mentioning. It's true that our main character rarely changes her facial expression or shows much emotion. But she is supposed to be ""green,"" in most senses of that expression. There are such people. It's not unrealistic that a small town Irish Catholic virgin in 1952 may be quiet and obedient. Her ""pure"" look is not an invention. That actress really is from Ireland and really looked like that at the time.I thought it was interesting to see how despite ethnic differences, being Catholic can be a bonding agent among immigrant Irish and Italians. She doesn't date a Jewish guy or an Episcopalian. 
Although interestingly they chose what I assume is a Jewish actor with soft features to play the Italian. He didn't have the edgy qualities one often associates with those groups in that place and time, nor the facial characteristics.But that type of shy, inexperienced neighborhood boy definitely existed and still does in Brooklyn. Commenters have wondered why he was so accepting of her faults. But clearly he had very little experience with girls, and was overwhelmed with gratitude that she liked him. There are guys like that. They don't want to stir the pot by complaining, thereby risk losing someone they feel may be above their station.Although our main girl's behavior upon return to Ireland seems to have upset many commenters, please remember that movie characters don't have to do the right thing or be loveable. Ironically some of the same people who felt that this picture was unrealistic, were upset that she was too real!Because let's face it people. A young girl could easily get caught up in the moment of her first puppy love without taking in the big picture. Then when the initial excitement dies down, she may realize that she hasn't explored the myriad other options for love and life, that would be available to her if she remains single.I can totally see a newly confident girl going back home to a small pond from a big sea, viewing things through new lenses, and being tempted by options.Ultimately it comes down to this: How realistic do you need every film to be, and what is ""real"" to one person may not be real to another. I watched the couple eat spaghetti together and then walk home. I wondered if they felt bloated or had garlic breath, but like in many romantic films, there is no sign of that. In a Ben Stiller film, there would probably by overkill on that.There is some genuine homesickness, some mortality, some gossip and resentment, and a little sea sickness. But the grimy ruggedness of mid century Ireland and Brooklyn were probably not represented with attention to detail. On the other hand, this young woman had multiple chaperones to shield her from it, so perhaps she lived with blinders on. In conclusion, if you want graphic reality, you will be disappointed. If you want to look at a starkly beautiful face, recall at least the surface agony and ecstasy of early post-adolescence and feel good overall, you'll enjoy this. I was actually pleased to be entertained and not feel like showering afterward."
" Home is where the heart is.
",0.0,0.8937,2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"The apparent (perhaps 'largest' or 'most obvious') central conflict - and, indeed, the supposed 'plot', as advertised and spoken about by pretty much everyone involved with its production - doesn't actually begin, in the strictest of senses, until the final third of 'Brooklyn (2015)', which leaves little room for this new, much more outward struggle and ultimately results in much of it seeming rather rushed and communicated somewhat ineffectively, especially considering that the tensions and temptations tearing our protagonist between her two homes often feel tenuous at best and that her choice, which is supposed to be a difficult and ambiguous one, actually ends up seeming rather obvious. The picture is actually much more of a character study than anything else, though, and certainly isn't marked solely by this late-edition plot-shift - though it's definitely solidified and enhanced by it. The film conveys itself through universal and surprisingly touching themes of home, heritage, love and the ever-evolving, unexpected nature of life itself. It comes together to become an incredibly endearing and entertaining experience that enchants as much as it emotionally affects, often making you long for a home you perhaps never had by letting you into the heart of a person who somehow doesn't really exist. 8/10"

",0.0,0.9741,2018-08-01 00:00:00,1,"Honestly, can't get my head around this one. Standing ovations at Sundance? Really? For this?So Saorse Ronan plays an emotionally blank young woman with a perpetual look of slightly pained superfluity, who emigrates to New York from a picture-postcard Ireland, depicted as a pursed, gossipy village of church-on-Sunday piousness and coded snobbery. Once in the Big Apple she drifts meekly through a succession of not-very-interesting adventures, with the blandest supporting cast of cardboard cutouts assembled in any film since the 1950s. Eventually she ends up back in Ireland for a stretch, works as an accountant (the drama!) and walks on the beach a couple of times with Donal Gleeson, before having a teacup spat with the old cow that she used to work for and deciding, almost reluctantly, to return to her husband in the 'States.And that's it.While it's basically inoffensive fluff, the sheer volume and intensity of critical praise heaped on this picture completely beggars belief. Ronan, while watchable, is entirely one-note from start to finish. The entire supporting cast are pasted in from kiddult romances from the 1950s, with cheerful stereotypes taking the place of any meaningful character development. Slavishly constructed around Ronan's mooney presence, the film floats aimlessly across the screen, providing neither insight into its lead character's emotional life or throwing up any truly troubling obstacles for her to overcome. In the end, so little happens, and all the characters are so thinly drawn that the viewer (or this one anyway) finds themself asking, ""what did I just watch, and was I supposed to care? If so, why did they make the lead character so dismally, relentlessly uninteresting? Why did she ditch the quirky, outspoken girl in her boarding house for the shallow, mean-spirited bimbos she works with? Was she actually into the young bloke she was romancing back home, or was he just a pleasing distraction? Would she really have left her husband just like that? Why wasn't he more angry with her for not writing or calling?""Ultimately, with stakes this low, such an empty lead character and a story so devoid of dramatic incident it's almost astonishing that this even garnered a theatrical release, let alone the fulsome admiration of critics worldwide."

During a visit back home, she feels conflicted about whether she should stay there or return to her new life in the U.S.""Brooklyn"" is a sweet film that succeeds at being sentimental without being cloying. It has an old-fashioned warmth particularly when it is being romantic.There are other aspects to admire especially a scene when homeless Irish male immigrants are being fed a Christmas dinner. There are also two acting stalwarts who contribute well to the film: Jim Broadbent as a kindly Irish priest who helps other Irish immigrants; and Julie Walters who is quite funny as a strict Irish landlady of a boarding house of young Irish women.The film is not without flaws including a small-town bully seems too one-dimensional. The role of Eilis' mother could also have been better developed. While Eilis (pronounced Ailish) faces a major dilemma near the end, there seemed to be a hurry to wrap things up. When one must make a major decision in life (as Eilis does), there is often sadness at the choice left behind. Eilis's attitude seemed too one-sided. This inner conflict was better handled in ""The Namesake"", a 2006 independent U.S. film.Despite these flaws, ""Brooklyn"" is still admirable especially for Ronan's performance. In the beginning, Eilis is shy, awkward, out of place, and homesick. Her transition throughout the movie is believable and touching. As a child actress in ""Atonement"" back in 2007, Ronan showed great potential which is proven further in ""Brooklyn"". Let's hope to see more of her."

" Brooklyn - review, 7/10
",0.0,0.9567,2018-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Brooklyn is the story of Eilis, a young Irish woman crossing to 1950s America to start the life she couldn't find in Ireland. At first overwhelmed, she soon finds her feet and the love of her life until tragedy and an unexpected match leaves her torn between her lives in Brooklyn and Ireland.The focus of the movie is place strongly on Eilis and her personal struggles; her sense of loneliness and vulnerability being homed in on by the director in an effort to elicit an emotional response, the beautiful musical score went a long way ensuring this hit the mark most times (though the emotion of the opening scenes and some in the third act felt very contrived). The introverted personality that we follow for the opening of the movie made for an uninteresting protagonist, aimlessly plodding along until she finds love in the form of an Italian plumber (yes, really...no, his name isn't Mario).However, the slow start is soon made up for. Set in an idyllic alternate Brooklyn adhering to the stereotypical 'American Dream' holding a quietly romantic tone throughout (as dictated by lead Saoirse Ronan) as the couple fall in love in the most unabashedly cheesy but endearing way. It didn't feel like anything new but it did feel very well done, in large part to the charming performances of Ronan and Cohen throughout.Following this, the movie began to outstay its welcome, the effect lack of a fleshed out secondary cast were felt and my attention would waver a bit as the third act commenced, suffering from the same forced emotion of the opening scenes of the movie. While the dichotomy of Eilis' identity was well-established, the film was taken over by an oppressively overly-sentimental tone which made me feel detached from the movie rather than investing me deeper. Brooklyn is a slow-burning love story and a unique immigrant story centred on the identity crisis of Eilis, though it suffers from some drawbacks; most notably a lackluster secondary cast and contrived attempts at sentimentality in places. Despite this, it's still something I'd recommend for its lovable protagonists (Ronan and Cohen) and their winning performances."

Especially when in the film we find that the personality of the first character of the story, Ronan Saurice, as Ellis, is a highly introverted, conservative and literary human.
On the other hand, the situation for the first character of the story is such that returning home with a rotation of one hundred and eighty degrees of livelihood situation and working conditions.

It was a visually appealing film, and I did enjoy that more than the actual script. One thing that is a pet peeve of mine and very, very common in the UK setting movies and television mini-series, is everything is perfect: the clothes, the hair, the immaculate homes, the neatness. Never a hair out of place, or a home-made hairdo or makeup. Supposed to believe that this young woman is not rich, yet her hair, makeup and clothing are perfect. That annoys me so much in UK films. American films are much more able to portray the messiness and imperfection of real life when it comes to clothes, hair and surroundings."

Yet despite having all this, the film STILL frustrated me because of a problem with the plot. This problem is an easy one to work out...yet inexplicably it became monstrously huge. Eilis (Saoirse Ronan) is a young Irish lady who has just learned she's being sponsored to go to America. While she's thrilled with a chance at a new life, it's all so overwhelming and strange and you follow Eilis on her journey. The first half of the film is incredibly sweet and nice. I knew since it was a movie things could not stay this way but I sure was hoping it would. Sadly, Eilis' sister has died and she must go back home...and leave the lovely Italian-American man she's come to love and just married. Inexplicably, when she arrives back in Ireland, she doesn't tell anyone she is married and even leads a wonderful man on by making him think he had a chance with her. And, through all this I felt like screaming ""WHY wouldn't you just tell everyone you are married and be done with it???

Only to find it has become a record breaker of its genre. Perhaps screenplay writer, Nick Hornby and director, John Crowley may never top the level of perfection they have achieved with this mature production. Neither of these men lived through the 50's - yet have avoided falling into the trap of adding too many 'modern' touches - creating a near perfect representation of the life and times of that era. Art direction and cinematography add further important creative technical touches. Young Saoirse Ronan does wonders with her important role as Eilis, an Irish girl facing the challenging step of leaving home and country - to start a new life in a strange land. With a flawless cast this often sad tale is brought to the screen with all the nuances of real-life sparklingly intact. Good to see the always reliable Jim Broadbent being used to good advantage. Congratulations are certainly due to all involved with transferring Colm Toibin's descriptive novel to the cinema (and maybe even adding helpful touches along the way). A rich addition to the overall impact comes from Canadian composer Michael Brook's truly beautiful score.Strong recommendation for lovers of quality motion pictures examining the morals, difficulties, and times, of those who went before us."

A love story almost more between home than men. An Irish woman immigrates to Brooklyn, NY in the 1950's for a chance to get more out of life. While there, she falls in love with a down to Earth, normal, Italian guy. Upon a visit back to Ireland and with more life experience under her belt, she meets an upper class chap and another romance beginseven though she has a love back in Brooklyn. During the story many subtle events occur, which is fine, but none draw the viewer in and elicit much emotion. Perhaps, you can see the story arcs coming. What is less obvious, is that she is also wrestling with staying in her motherland vs going back to America. What will she decide? What events will influence her decision? The fact this nominated for three Oscars, which is coolthe one that scares me was one was for best adapted screenplay. For me, that was its weakness."

Not quite top 10 of 2015 material but one of the easier to watch and like films of the year, providing that the gentle deliberate pacing does not bother you (it didn't me). 'Brooklyn' has a slight and simple story that doesn't break boundaries, cover new ground and lacks edge, but this does not matter when it is as sweet, charming and touching as it is.Faults are few actually. The final third is a little forced with some of it feeling a bit too neat and a slightly passive indecisiveness, even for her conflicting emotions and difficulties with following her heart, in the lead character that wasn't there for the rest of the film. Despite a natural easy-going chemistry with Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen is a little too laid back in his role that he comes over as dull.Ronan however is terrific, she was a promising child actress as said, here in 'Brooklyn' she comes of age and gives her character nuance and pathos without weakening the character. In support, the standout is the sheer comic delight that is Walters while Broadbent is suitably robust. Domhnall Gleeson is charming.John Crowley keeps things beautifully controlled without slacking. 'Brooklyn' looks beautiful, the 1950s setting is austere yet strikingly evocative and the cinematography positively glows. Michael Brooks' score is subtle but very well suited to the period and the film's tone.Scripting is intelligent, emotion-soaked and has the right amount of charm and sweetness without going sugary or frothy. Some may find that story-wise it's small in scale, being slight and conventional somewhat, but there is no denying that 'Brooklyn' has a big heart and that the love story is beguiling that shows the film making successful efforts at depth and truth.It's as warm as sitting by the fireplace with a pair of slippers on your feet and drinking hot milk and am not the first to admit having tears of joy (there are some understated humorous moments without busting a gut, which was appropriate) and sadness (it's a tear-jerker but doesn't try too hard to be or manipulate people into getting emotional, the emotion is very much genuine). The characters are well written and for what they may lack in depth they more than make up for with heart and charm.Overall, a lovely, beguiling, warm love story that may be small in its scale but when it comes to the heart it couldn't shine any bigger. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" This is the best movie I have seen this year
",0.6369,0.9864,2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie is so good I don't even know where to begin, two years after its release.The story has drama, laughter and sadness. The mood of each setting in the movie is captured perfectly. Saoirse Ronan gives one of the best performances I have ever seen.As a middle-aged man, sci-fi and adventure fan, I never expected I would be much interested. This movie had me glued to the screen. I saw it twice in the space of a month when I recommended it to friends who came over for a movie. The second time I liked it even better than the first. They loved it.This needs to be on your to-watch list."
" Brooklyn is a simple story told with amazing beauty and depth of emotion
",0.8225,0.995,2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't really feeling this movie, when I first heard about it but, it had caught my attention. I finally watched it recently and it was perfect. I am very picky when it comes to romance moves but, Brooklyn blew me away. I am going to be reading the novel soon, Brooklyn is definitely one of my favorites.Really enjoyed it. Went from a perfectly pleasant coming of age story to some real deep meaning about identity, home, love, and career. Didn't see any problems with it. It got pretty dramatic and heavy at times, all while sticking with the same tone. I guess the only issue I had with it is that it was kind of slow at the beginning and I wasn't absolutely in love with it.--- From Yidioo"
" Good drama that could have reached greater heights
",0.7003,0.96,2017-04-29 00:00:00,7,"Brooklyn for the most part was a well directed film that showcased excellent acting and a great story. We see an Irish girl travel to America and then build a lifestyle that is hard to leave behind such as her marriage, job and new friends. In Ireland she has her mother, a job she can easily jump into and a well to do suitor. The film takes a unique look at the tug of war one can face with two lifestyles in different countries. It was a great story that looked at a certain period in history that involved large scale immigration. However the story's end was a let down. We see the main character almost going back to Ireland when an incident of potential blackmail makes her now want to go back home. The logic and emotion behind this was unexplained and could leave viewers scratching their heads. Why did she decide to return to America? What was the audience supposed to see and understand here? The story felt built up with her dilemma only to be offered a weird explanation in the end, its like the director didn't know how to end the film."
" An Irish Blessing.
",0.4939,0.9902,2017-04-08 00:00:00,8,"A charming story, with an admirable cast and lovable characters. Brooklyn narrates a very grounded, and even better; relatable, story in a very appealing and likable way.This movie is about family, home, loss, choice and of course, love, and it melds it all together so well. Saoirse Ronan is incredibly captivating and never drops the ball once. She is an absolute joy to watch, and this role was tailor made for her, and she executed it with class.Ermory Cohan, though he too was very impressive, I feel was just a little bit miscast. Ermory has a look about him that screams ""bad guy"", that had me concerned for the most part, that he would turn into an abusive dolt. If the character was meant to seem that way for the plot, he would've been perfect, but Tony is innocent and ""sweet"", and Ermory threw me off from time to time.From there, the character dynamics were a pleasure. Eilis and Rose, Mary and Rose, Eilis and Mary. Eilis and her boarding house mates. Eilis and her best friend, Eilis and Jim, Eilis and the witch and of course, Eilis and Tony.Brooklyn is a definite must watch. Its simplicity is quite simply, delightful. A firm 8/10."
" Great Dialoge, Good Acting and Standard Story
",0.7906,0.958,2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Brooklyn is in every way entertaining to watch. The Best thing about it, is the well written dialogue, which makes you laugh or grin happily. That's also just possible because of the often likable but always interesting characters, whether it's the quirky matron, the smooth Italian or the self-made women. The main character is more believable in comparison, but falls a little flat. Saoirse Ronan, nevertheless, is amazing in this role. She really should be in more movies. Don't watch the trailer of this movie. It's giving away too much. I read in another critic, that the main character has no real problems. I disagree strongly. Yeah, her problems aren't big social, political or economic issues or life-threatening in a direct way, but she has to struggle with big matters of her own life. Leaving her family, especially her sad mother, forever alone and deciding for her own life. It's not just a choice between two men. They are just symbols of two different paths of life. So in some way it's basically a coming of age story. This is not a new story nor is it the best depiction of it, however it's a good one. And if you're having a date, it's perfect."
" Last Exit to Ireland.
",0.0,0.9786,2017-03-03 00:00:00,4,"Brooklyn: 4 out of 10. For such a gentle passive costume drama about a 1950's emigrant from Ireland Brooklyn evoked a surprising amount of ire. First of I am surprised that Saoirse Ronan was nominated for an Oscar in this role. She isn't a bad actress by any means but her character is so passive and banal and inconsistent that it is hard to get a read on the performance. Leaving aside the main character for a minute the film has a few other issues. While the interiors are filmed well the exteriors (Particularly the ones that are supposed to be in Brooklyn) seem out of a made for PBS movie from the mid-eighties rather than a modern film. One-half expects Raul Julia to pop up in at any moment doing a riff on Casablanca. The remaining characters, with one notable exception doing her best Margaret Hamilton impression, are played as very nice people. Almost too nice. It is as if a Mary Sue convention let out next door. All the characters also only seem to exist to help, enable and be nice to our heroine. They rarely seem to have lives of their own. Our heroine, by any measure, is a horrible self-centered person. I am unsure if the film even realizes this. Ronan plays her as a passive aggressive social wallflower yet the script seems to have written her as a predatory self-centered narcissist. As a result, we have a character asking a man to walk her home not because she is interested but so she can abandon a new young immigrant girl she finds disagreeable (The film mind you gives us no reason to find this ancillary character disagreeable which makes her declaration even more jarring) Ronan's character then proceeds to tell bigger lies and inflict even greater cruelties on her loved ones and those whose only crime is being nice to her. Yet the film seems strangely oblivious to its protagonist's cruelty. A wisp of a film only promoted by a surprise Oscar nomination and a veneer of a decent date night film. It disappoints on almost all levels."
" It's not a matter of trying , it's what you have to do .
",-0.0191,0.9926,2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"I like this adapting movie , even-though i'm not into romantic movies nor classic , but i find this really enjoyable film because of its magnificent dramatic scenes , but i'm still wondering! why John Crowley didn't get nominated for this movie , in my humble opinion , i don't see that Nick Hornby has done any worthy of note changes, ""i mean from the novel"" that makes him worth an Oscar . and when it comes to the performance judging i say that i admire the marvelous acting of Saoirse Ronan in this movie , and i think she deserves an Oscar for it too , but i believe that Fiona Glascott ""Rose"" is better at sad moment scenes than her , and i hope she get opportunities for more leading role ,and about ""Emory Cohen"" i reckon he doesn't fit in romantic roles but i guess he can do action/drama adroitly , i don't want to forget that boy , Tony's brother the gossipy child , he's cool and i hope he gets attention in the future. also in terms of the movie shooting i noticed there once in of the begging scenes , they kept the camera still , toward ""Eilis"" face more than they should have , i mean obviously it was superfluous . the morals and lessons learned from this movie are :- 1-moving on and traveling can change a lot of one's habits , and many things in your personality , but not necessary everything , like ""Saoirse"" there's one trait in her character that didn't change which is amenability, i mean being amenable . 2-the world is small place and you can't hide a secret for too long . 3-as life goes on we will discover that our life isn't our choice . the third point elucidate the summary title i put for this movie . the earnings of this movie was satisfying . finally i still have two questions twirling in my head , the first is why she kept procrastinate reading tony's letters ? is it because she don't want to remember him or to miss him , or she just doesn't love him anymore ! the second one is was she going to go back to Brooklyn even if ""miss Kelly"" haven't told her that she knows about her marriage story ? Those question make the movie join to a third genre besides Drama which is Mystery . Thank you for reading this ."
" A Sweet Girl
",0.4588,0.9856,2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"The film was heartwarming and deservedly received Oscar nominations for Best Picture and for Best Actress for Saoirse Ronan. It showed the narrow-minded and dead-end society that Eilis faced in her native Ireland in the early 1950s and how she was able to expand her horizons in America. On a visit back to Ireland she is tempted to remain by visions of a better future there but then realizes that things haven't really changed that much and her future is still in America, where she returns to the husband that she had married for love but seemed to forget while back in Ireland. That said, the movie was somewhat disappointing for several reasons: while probably historically accurate, it seems a shame that a young woman would go from an Irish homeland to a similarly insulated Irish immigrant community in Brooklyn. When she meets her husband-to-be at a dance he is probably the first Italian-American she has ever met. When she is invited to dinner at his home, the more-worldly girls in her all-Irish boarding house have to teach her how to eat spaghetti, a dish she has never tried. This gradual breakout from an insular community to a multi-ethnic society was probably accurate for the early 1950s. It reminded me of an autobiography by a journalist who had gone to work for Fortune magazine at that time. He pointed out that the staff had, besides WASPs, some Catholics and even Jews, which they considered to be highly ethnically diverse at the time. And no doubt the children of Eilis, a bookkeeper, and Tony, a plumber, would go to college and become teachers, lawyers, and journalists, and be friends with Asians, African-Americans, and Latinos. And their grandchildren would probably convert to other faiths and even marry outside their traditional family. Secondly, the romance between Eilis and Tony is probably accurate for many couples, especially during wartime or when confronted with new and different types of people. But one wishes they had shared more of their interests and concerns, to see how compatible they would be later in life, rather than just go on the fact that Tony is a ""nice guy"" and Eilis is a ""sweet girl."" Eilis is a person of few words, but when she does talk her tone implies a wisdom and curiosity not outwardly evident. She is an avid letter writer and it's a shame she couldn't have shown more of that personality to her daily associates.Thirdly, I find period movies like this to be annoying because the clothes all look so new and clean, like everyone just stepped out of wardrobe (which they no doubt did). Could they put some of the clothes through 100 washes to at least make them look used? It's also the same with the period cars, like they borrowed them from collectors and wouldn't dare to get them dirty. Finally, why didn't it occur to Eilis to invite her mother to come live with her and Tony in America? That situation is not totally unheard of. In fact, there is a house design common in Queens, and probably Brooklyn, too, known as a ""Mother-Daughter home"" because it has a family living area downstairs and a smaller unit on the second floor."
" Slow, heart-warming movie
",0.0,0.988,2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"This is such a heart-warming movie! It does not display any of the fast pace often used in Hollywood movies. The plot unfolds slowly, allowing the watcher to share the protagonists' emotions. Myself not being an English native speaker, I enjoyed the different kids of accents (all very easy to understand!) used in the movie. Also, I always enjoy historical insights into entering the US (like Ellis Island) which is also very shortly covered in the movie. Also, the actors' immense beautiful acting needs to be praised! There is surely no overacting, no out-crying drama or over-joyous happiness like in a fairy tale. The movie displays an emotional range one might encounter in everyday life - which I found very intriguing.Since I do not want to spoil the movie, I can only recommend it! I'm wondering wondering whether a male audience would enjoy this film as much because the main protagonist is a woman. Nevertheless, it's a delight to watch!"
