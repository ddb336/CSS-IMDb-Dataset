" Comy and cliche.
",0.0,-0.6945,2021-04-10 00:00:00,1,"The script must have been written by someone with a mental age of 12 years. The characters are very cliches types: adults who have never come out of adolescence, marijuana, drink, fornication. That's too corny! The dialogues are silly. It is one of those films that the protagonists are so boring and sick that you cheer for the antagonists, who seem to be more ""good people"". So terribly boring and uninteresting that I had to speed up the play for 2.0x speed to support watch until the end."

" A satisfying popcorn muncher!
",0.5093,0.9948,2021-03-10 00:00:00,7,"Extraterrestrial is from the same stable as ""Grave Encounters"" which I suppose should tell us not to expect much from this low budget, teenage, cabin in the woods ET romp. However, this movie is both satisfying & entertaining as a B movie can get, It is far from perfect, but it certainly is not terrible either.We begin with an alien abduction of a young lady in a phone booth in an area where a group of young friends are taking a vacation to a log cabin. 2 girls in the group set out to explore only to find a tent filled with cannabis plants as part of a hideaway for a Vietnam Vet & family friend to one of the young ladies. The Vet has evidence that aliens are operating in the area & that night a UFO crash lands and an alien being begins to terrorize our teenage friends, with one of them shooting dead the alien, leading to the aliens taking revenge as 3 friends are picked off one by one...While reasonably good this movie does have some annoying faults. My biggest peeve here is an overly LOUD sound effects track. We go from whispered, barely audible dialogue, to ear-splitting, headache educing BANGS. The script is let down by F words every few minutes & the whole movie is clich√© ridden. The uncle Vet in the woods is very stereotypical, although the part is well acted by the superb Michael Ironside, which I enjoyed immensely. The sub-plot romance is distracting & adds nothing to the story. And the end is quite predictable. But overall this movie is well paced, well acted & gives us a creepy ride which is fun. The effects are imaginative & while not sophisticated, they remain creative & enjoyable.It is clear that this movie is aimed at a youth audience, however middle-aged horror/sci-fi folks like me will also find this an unsophisticated jolly romp. There are no sex scenes, but be prepared for an ""F"" heavy script. There is gore, but this is appropriate to the story & it is not excessive in my opinion. Finally, I believe this movie has been unfairly panned & should be rated a 6 at least on here, so my advice is, if you love the sci-fi/horror genre you will enjoy ""Extraterrestrial"" This movie is no ""Alien"" (1979) masterpiece, but it certainly entertains!"
" No fun at all
",0.2732,-0.4614,2021-02-21 00:00:00,4,"Here a young director has taken over again after he made a really good debut with a friend as co-director at his side with ""Grave Encounters"". Apparently the godfather for ""Extraterrestrial"" was Robert Lieberman's ""Fire in the Sky"", which is also a tough and at times unbearably unimportant strip of alien terror, but can reconcile it with an extraordinarily well-made and shocking sequence after the kidnapping by the aliens. With ""Extraterrestrial"" you wait in vain for this rewarding moment, this soap opera is just annoying, right down the line. A mainstream bore which ingratiates itself with the young target audience, which bobs around in a reasonably entertaining manner, tries to clich√© endlessly, in short, which is simply annoying and superfluous. What Emily Perkins has lost in this Schmonzette eludes me completely, well, actors also have to earn a living somehow, and it was great to see her in a movie again. All in all 4/10."

However I'm not sure if the director decided to scene-check his favourite films to make this more enjoyable. The references can't just be clich√© or accidental. The cabin setup is Evil Dead, the handheld shots of the alien encounter is Blair Witch, the scenes inside the spaceship are Alien 2, the abduction in the phone booth looks like Bill and Ted, anal probe is Independence Day and those are just the ones I noticed. But final scene where the anonymous government agency takes control is surely The X files - especially when the man in charge takes out a cigarette and inhales forever. There's also a nice cameo from Michael Ironside who's as kooky as ever."

" Formula filmmaking that does get some things right.
",0.0,0.8663,2020-10-17 00:00:00,6,"Brittany Allen ('All My Children') and Freddie Stroma (from a few of the ""Harry Potter"" movies) are girlfriend and boyfriend, college students who head to the old family cabin in the woods, his aggravating friends in tow. They're just in time to get caught up in strange events - namely, alien visitation and the abduction of various human characters. Things go from bad to worse in record time.Colin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz, a.k.a. The Vicious Brothers, keep the alien encounter genre alive and well with this fairly enjoyable tale. It begins well, with a bizarre pre-opening credits bit, then threatens to derail once Stromas' friends show up. They're hard to take for a while. Is it too much trouble for screenwriters to create non-stereotypical young adults? Anyway, the story strengthens shortly before the half-hour mark, as it keeps adding alien encounter material. I will give Minihan and Ortiz and their crew some credit for ratcheting up the intensity and otherworldly atmosphere. At times, this actually does get fairly spooky. The aliens themselves, looking every bit the classic image of extraterrestrial beings, are unspeaking, menacing and sadistic.For a film shot in approximately three weeks on a $3 million budget, this creates some pretty decent visual effects (not to mention sound design). Music, production design, and cinematography are all appropriate. The performances range from annoying (Jesse Moss as Seth can't die soon enough) to adequate to somewhat sturdy; Allen and Stroma are appealing in the lead roles. Gil Bellows is good as an unsmiling sheriff who, for once, actually comes to believe the kids' story. (In the vast majority of movies like this, the authority figure doesn't believe one word the hero or heroine says.) Michael Ironside gives the proceedings a shot in the arm with his colourful performance as an old family friend who grows pot out in the wilderness, but he's under-utilized. They could have kept him around a little while longer. It is nice to watch a contribution by actress Emily Perkins of ""Ginger Snaps"" fame.At first, this viewer wasn't sure how to feel about the ending, but realized that it makes some sense given the nature of some of Ironsides' dialogue.VERY reminiscent of ""Fire in the Sky"" at times.Six out of 10."

",0.4404,0.9455,2020-02-16 00:00:00,8,"There seems to be mixed reviews on this movie and I'm not sure why. I thought it was a great movie on a small budget. No complaints about the acting, nothing wrong with the plot, the music was pretty good, the scenery was pretty cool, etc. Imo, viewers are just hypercritical because they're expecting some not well known movie to be a hidden gem with a completely new plot idea that will blow them out of the water based on unrealistic expectations.Just relax and enjoy it for what it is! It's a great movie!The ending is one you might not see coming, but maybe should have. It sort of ties everything together that was present from the beginning. I can't elaborate without giving anything away, but, seriously, give this movie a try. It's really not as bad as some seem to think it is."
" Aliens obsessed with our behinds
",-0.1779,0.8339,2020-02-13 00:00:00,4,"It contains somewhat better special effects and acting than your typical SyFy fare. However, the story is kinda lame but it has a mild twist at the end. My low rating is because they are trying to be a serious movie, and dramatically fail. So, humans apparently came to an agreement with this far superior alien species, that the aliens will allow the human race to continue surviving if we allow them to randomly abduct and experiment on humans. But even after experimenting on thousands of humans for over 70 years, these aliens are still inexplicably obsessed with sticking probes up our behinds. If there really is an alien species out there, I am certain they would be offended of what we think of them!"

" Get ready to lose all the good things you expect from a good sci fi movie
",0.6808,0.8991,2019-12-31 00:00:00,3,"I have always been a huge sci-fi fan. Ever since I was little and watched re runs of the original star trek series. I always grew up with the original Star wars trilogy.( 4,5 and 6.) Which to this day are still my favorites. I always loved the Alien movies as well. In this film I felt as if they were going for a comedy not type of movie. The plot was full of holes and the acting was definitely nothing to write home about. Granted, yes the twist of the ending was clever but not amazing. I really feel this was geared more towards the younger generation who know sci-fi movies as the remake of Ca in in the woods. Kids essentially who don't know what they have with the special effects. You won't be on the edge of your seat ( unless you're waiting for it to be over) it's really just a really low budget film. When it was over I said to myself there's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back. But if it seems good to you after you watch the trailer by all means check and don't form an opinion based on my review."

As low budget horrors go this is okay. After the first 30 mins I was thinking oh no but this turned out okay. Some good creeps and jumps, the effects are decent and it goes where most ufo films don't.... gives you a good look at the aliens themselves, their craft and what they're up too. This is certainly one of the better ufo horrors."
" Too little, too late
",0.0,0.9313,2019-12-29 00:00:00,4,"Considering that this movie was made on a $3,000,000 budget (according to IMDB), they did the best they could with very limited resources.I believe rhe actors did ok with a mediocre script, and the addition of two veteran actors, Michael Ironside and Gil Bellows, helped quite a bit. There were some attempts at being intentionally conscious of some sci-fi cliches.In my opinion, the last 25 minutes of the film was the best, most interesting and imaginative part, with a not totally expected twist ending. Wish they would've been at this level throughout..It might be worth watching if you can keep your expectations on the low side."

It centres around a group of friends that end up in a cabin, that makes most cabins I've seen appear like a small shed.Things go a little pearshape when a surprise goes south, and then something appears in the sky.What I liked about this film, is that there is some comical bits (the camcorder bit made me crack up), and there are some parts that are what you probably think would happen, if aliens popped down for a visit.Michael Ironside is in it, which is good to see him in later films.But there is one thing that annoys me in films with 'young adults' in. I say young, as in 20's I'm guessing. Its the phrase 'Oh My God', and the other one that appears a lot 'Hey guys' or 'you guys'. Even though a guy is a male, but hey, its a new world out there.Just if this was a british film, substitute OMG with a few other choice words lol."

Beaming the friend up with friends watching, FITS. When she had escaped her pod and wondered around the space ship... Yup you guessed it, Fire in the Sky. Only difference, FITS was a true story.Dumb decisions... A few but I will pick one. The blonde friend who said, let's go now! We can't stay. I'm scared. Yada yada yada.... Gets out and stares into the ship and wow, completely taken by surprise... She beams up.The thing I thought was stupid
VERY BIG SPOILER
After surviving an impossible escape, she gets shot in the stomach! He gets shot a few times too. They both fall onto the ground and she takes out the engagement ring, from her tight jean pocket. She gives it to him and he puts it on her finger. She has a straight gun shot wound in the stomach and can do this??? No. He can do this after being shot multiple times??? No. They both did this without sleep all night, battling aliens and being abducted, with one of them already dying once....If the hadn't of copied Fire in the sky so much and the ending had not included that ridiculous ending, it may not have been that bad."

I was so surprised when I did. It's head and shoulders above the other alien abduction films. Good cast, nice Micheal Ironside character (underused) and great effects. It has a kind of slasher hunts teens in a cabin vibe through first half but obviously with aliens. ..........some nice shocks and an ending that kept me transfixed.

But this movie brings a refreshing feeling to this theme and the negative criticism that the actors got for ""bad acting"" is really far-fetched. The parts where there seems to be ""bad acting"" is really deliberate bad acting in order to create humor.

",0.0,0.9893,2018-07-19 00:00:00,7,"It's a shame that most viewers seem to have missed the boat on this movie. I think the whole intent was to EMBRACE, even celebrate the B-movie phenomenon. I fully expected it to be a stereotypical, low-budget alien movie . . . And yes, it WAS. Complete with cliche elements & characters: alien abductions; UFO crash; government cover-ups; cabin-in-the-woods; flying saucers; ""The Greys"" . . . the ditzy blonde; the cowardly idiot (boy, did they fix HIS little red wagon!); the pot-growing, paranoid, conspiracy-nut Vietnam vet, the heroic surviving (so you think!) young couple . . . . This movie employed every worn-out alien cliche out there, but with some dark humor & unexpected twists.
Folks, my take on it was that the cliches & stereotypes were absolutely intentional. I rather enjoyed the homage & nods to the scores of past alien movies (& even to ""The Smoking Man"" from X-Files).
Admittedly, many times throughout the film I thought, ""Yup, here we go - I know what comes next."" But then the darkly funny twists pulled me back in. While some of you found the ending disturbing, I think it was brilliant. It led viewers to the edge of an expected typical conclusion, with a feigned ""happily-ever-after"" sappy scene that had my eyes rolling . . . . Until the film kept rolling, & delivered its unexpected coup-de-gras.
If you don't appreciate dark humor - then this one's not for you. If you're hoping for a deep plot, well-developed characters, a sweet, happy ending, or a never-before-seen portrayal of aliens & UFOs - then this one definitely isn't for you. But I found it to be delightfully entertaining.

While director/co-writer Colin Minihan and co-writer Stuart Ortiz do successfully generate plenty of nerve-rattling tension, ably craft a strong and unsettling atmosphere of pure creepy dread (the scenes on the spaceship are positively nightmarish), deliver a few neat bits of nasty gore, and conclude things on a surprising downbeat note, this film nonetheless fails to score a complete bull's eye due to the extremely annoying and unappealing young adult main characters, lots of remarkably irritating excessive profanity, and an uneven tone that veers uncomfortably from stark horror to goofy humor without ever finding a steady balance between the two polar extremes. Fortunately, the always reliable Michael Ironside livens up the proceedings with customary aplomb as flaky Vietnam veteran hermit Travis. Gil Bellows likewise does well as a no-nonsense sheriff who's trying to figure out what's going on in his sleepy small town. Not bad, but it could (and should) have been much better."
" MEH (minor spoilers)
",-0.2577,-0.847,2017-12-30 00:00:00,2,"I'm a highly skeptical horror and science fiction fan (as two separate genres). I've seen a ton of them and a shockingly high proportion of them are utter failures and disappointments. So I went in with the lowest expectations. And by god it did not fail me. This was by no means the worst film I've seen but it was one of the biggest MEHs.At the beginning it was average until the sheriff asks the girl ""who did this to you?"" and she answers ""who do you think!"" Then there was the point when Lex gets out of the car and just stands there when all her horrified friends are screaming for her to save herself and get back in the car. From then on it was nothing more than a horrific nosedive straight down.I'm not going to go into the bad acting, plot holes, horrible dialogue, etc. There are enough reviews on here doing that. But what I will say is this: unless you are one of those movie-goers with a voracious appetite for everything sci-fi/horror, or both regardless of whether it's good or bad, take a hard pass on this on this one. There are other films out there worthy of your time and money."
" Okay types. No high hopes.
",0.3612,-0.8732,2017-11-07 00:00:00,5,"What I learned from such movies is that there is always one jerk who attracts trouble, there is always one bully who f****s-up the whole situation in the end and there is always on f***er who just walks underneath the spaceship or super curious a$$***le.Ôªø Even those aliens were kind enough to spare the lives of that girl and boy. It our own government who killed them. So, who is the monster ? Food for thought. The last two background songs were pathetic. Why that gentle policeman had to die ? and Travis too. Not everyone except lead characters had to die in a survival movie. Last but on the least, what's up with that bloody anal probe ? I know that guy was a complete asshole but simple disembowelment could have sufficed.Ôªø"
" Typical Bad Alien Movie
",-0.5423,-0.8299,2017-10-02 00:00:00,2,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie but the level of ridiculousness was over the top and the movie just couldn't gain its footing. From characters not breaking windows to get into places when running for their lives, to believing that boarding up windows will stop aliens from outer space, to using flashlights in the dark when trying to hide from aliens. I really could make a nearly endless list for this movie; it was almost impressive. This movie left me more frustrated than scared... sigh..."
" Great movies if you like B (C) movies
",0.765,-0.7626,2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,"Best movie I ever saw, got better as it went on. Watch through the credits. The hats nod to the x files smoking man was my favorite part! If you need a movie to be serious or make sense this is not for you! If you are guilty of watching the syfy channel movie special when everyone else is asleep then it is a must see! Not know what this flick was I went from ""what is this crap"" to ""OMG did that just really happen?"". All stops get pulled! I don't want to spoil it to much but from this review I think those who want to see it should know it is worth their time and those that don't appreciate this type of film (no hate, we all have different tastes) know to stay away! But without a doubt this is the guilty 2am McDonalds cheeseburger combo extra large of movies!"
" Unpolished blockbuster
",0.5994,-0.9716,2017-08-21 00:00:00,2,"This is a low budget, and a low in almost everything little movie. It is watchable if you don't care and have friends to talk to and a lot of popcorn.For example, it all start with a frenetic woman in shock who is running in pouring rain for help. She reach a store which is closing, so the responsible simply lock the door on her saying ""we're closed"" and don't give a heck that she is in trouble and urgently need help in that remote area.After that, we notice that she is not wet, even if she was running in the rain. She then run to a phone booth to call 911. We can see that she is in a light dress, almost a night dress with nothing else (she is running for her life). An alien craft then come over her head and suck her in. But by magic, the policeman that comes after to investigate the scene, finds in the rubble guess what¬Ö the woman's wallet with her picture! Where the heck was she keeping that wallet?Anyway, it is just an example in order to describe the lack of work in that movie. For the rest of it, it is again really bad aliens that violently kidnap people in order to torture them."
" stuck in B-movie
",-0.25,0.9056,2017-06-02 00:00:00,4,"Sheriff Murphy (Gil Bellows) of Echo Lake investigates the mysterious disappearance of Nancy McPherson from a seeming alien abduction as well as other strange occurrences. April (Brittany Allen) photographs the family cabin for her mother which is being sold. Her boyfriend Kyle (Freddie Stroma) joins her along with annoying friend Seth (Jesse Moss), Melanie (Melanie Papalia), and Lex (Anja Savcic). Melanie and April stumble upon their neighbor Travis (Michael Ironside)'s marijuana grow operation. Travis is a vet conspiracy nut. An alien spacecraft crashes in the woods.This movie seems stuck in B-movie territory. It's definitely set up as such and never gets beyond that. The young actors are not that charismatic. Bellows and Ironside are the two named actors but they are mostly support. Ironside goes a little wacky but nothing is actually funny. The script is lacking. There are some functional special effects which border on respectable. However, there is something missing from the directions and camera work. This is not scary nor particularly thrilling. None of it is that good but it's not the worst thing in the world."
" Another Cabin In The Woods Populated With Red-Shirts...
",0.0,0.9896,2017-05-28 00:00:00,6,"So here we have another cabin in the woods story with a group of red- shirt young people, and as always their justification for being there is tenuous. Evidently, the cabin was the vacation home for April and her family. Now her family has fallen apart her mother has conned her daughter into going to the cabin to take a few pictures of the shack so she can sell it; apparently, real-estate agents charge the earth for this service. From the first night, the stereotypical group of friends encounter a series of strange and scary events.So this sounds very familiar... and it is, though it does have some pretty good points... in the beginning at least. I loved the opening sequence which is Bill and Ted's Nightmare. The thing which surprised me most was how good Gil Bellows is as Sheriff Murphy, the scene when he pulls the ""let's go die'ers"" over was one of my favourite scene's and Bellows is very believable, I wouldn't cross the Sheriff.Then when Michael Ironside appears I was already enjoying the film and was looking forward to seeing how it would progress...Down the toilet... with a double flush!Ironside and Bellows aren't in the movie anywhere near long enough, and though the rest of the cast are okay it's their storyline which lets the film down. Brittany Allan and Freddie Storma aren't too bad as the lovers, April and Kyle, though they're going through a rough patch. Melanie, played by Melanie Papalia, is such a bland throwaway character that if she stood in one place for too long she'd just fade away. Then there's Seth who's portrayed by Jesse Moss; too well if truth be told, as the character is unlikeable and you wonder how anybody could actually be his friend... Oh, I nearly forgot Lex, Anja Savcic, who is Seth's eye-candy ""blonde"", at the moment, girlfriend - guess who goes first...The story starts it's slide into the pan when Travis (Ironside) recounts to the red-shirts that the human race knows about the existence of aliens and it's excepted that if we don't mess with them then they won't do anything too bad to us... Okay! Unfortunately, April has killed one of them and this action has put her friends on their hit-list.Though most of the movie is pretty unoriginal, there are some good scenes like the opening and the one where Murphy comes across a taped abduction and when he gets mind-melded. The special effects are above average too - the guy's even built a wrecked UFO, though when you see the size of the greys you do wonder how they ever fitted inside. My favourite effect is the tractor beam... I wanna go!Though it's the ending that really kills the film. For some strange reason writer and director Colin Minihan, along with writer Stuart Ortiz (under the pseudonym The Vicious Brothers) opt for an over-the-top unbelievable schmaltzy ending. Though Minihan is capable of filming nicely stylised shots, with some interesting angles, he's not too great at handling emotion. The penultimate climax is risible and instead of making me think, NO! you can't do that!, it had me giggling... and cringing... And the homage to the X-Files is more of an Oh No! than a Cool! moment. However, he nearly makes up for it with the beautifully filmed climax, the effects and cuts are seamless, I skipped back a few times just to watch that scene over again.If the Vicious Brothers had risked it all to give the audience a fresh approach to the ""Cabin In The Woods"" sub-genre with some original characters and a more realistic outcome, as well as filling in some gaping holes in the story, then this could have been a brilliant movie. Shame.I would recommend it for the reasons I've stated above as they just outweigh the negative elements, though I would say rent it before you consider buying... and only rent when it's cheap."
" Horror? or Horrible!!!
",-0.8433,-0.9744,2017-04-26 00:00:00,1,"Started out promising while the characters in the beginning seemed promising until I realized, they're all bland and boring AND are clich√© we have the Pothead, The Jock, Pretty girl, Dumb Blonde, Hipster and ALIENS!!! So at some point in the film, they're all partying and having a good time until GUESS WHO COMES TO CRASH THE PARTY? YOU GOT IT RIGHT!!! ALIENS!!!!! There's a lot of clich√© moments that had me yawning and nearly shouting ""F**king stop!!!"" There was a moment and *Spoilers* This blonde chick leaves the car during a serious scene in which a UFO is hovering over their car! she looks up at this thing while others are screaming at her and guess what, she gets abducted and guess what!! They obviously ripped some of that off of (Fire in the sky) (1993) The Aliens also look really, well, MEH. I hate this film, I HATE IT SO F**KING MUCH!!! Destroy it! Someone please destroy this horrible movie, wipe it from existence! 1/10, Don't spend nor waste data on this horrible ""movie"""
" Not Out of This World
",0.0,0.8816,2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"The best way to get anything out of Extraterrestrial is to watch the first 10 minutes and the last 40 minutes and so treat it as a solid X Files episode, because it sadly does not work as a full-length feature. While the alien action is sound enough (although it breaks no new ground), the film just does not hang together due to stilted scenes that often run on too long (including one or two botched 'jump scares'), and it is somewhat ironic that the Vicious Brothers were not vicious enough in the editing suite. Consequently, if the directors had pared the film down to around 80 minutes then it would work well. As it is, however, the tale loses momentum badly in the middle with the inclusion of a number of static and visually incoherent scenes, and the use of the always-watchable Michael Ironside handily revealing the alien plot to keep things moving and deal with any questions as to the purpose of the aliens (who are indeed plural, so surely the title of the film should be Extraterrestrials?). However, the last 40-30 minutes do go some way to redeeming the film, and while sci-fi clich√©s abound (although I suspect that they are conscious science fiction homages), the ending is satisfying (with a rather good intertextual link to a certain iconic TV show)."
" Teens in the woods meet aliens in this predictable thriller
",0.1027,-0.8038,2017-04-23 00:00:00,4,"EXTRATERRESTRIAL is a low budget, shot-in-Canada, sci-fi/horror movie about a group of teenagers holidaying at a cabin in the woods when they're interrupted by a UFO and a group of aliens desperate to abduct them. The film was made by the Vicious Brothers, who previously made the ultra-derivative GRAVE ENCOUNTERS, and like that movie this is a very familiar offering that mixes together bits and pieces of horror and sci-fi entertainment from the last few decades. The main source of inspiration seems to be NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, which is blatantly copied at times.It's the film's predictability that works against it in the end; the result is strictly routine and nothing you haven't seen before. The dialogue is completely unmemorable and the actors seem prone to shouting and screaming their lines rather than speaking rationally. After the slow set up, things play out in high tempo and it all becomes pretty wearying. Cast-wise, the only actor of note is the reliably odd Michael Ironside, but he has too little screen time. The rest is a mix of cheap effects, shaky camera-work, and routine plotting."
" Pros and Cons, like any film.
",0.3612,0.0018,2017-04-11 00:00:00,4,"I was at first totally uninterested in the film simply due to the way the teenagers acted. Typical modern day rich teens, all about alcohol, marijuana, sex and screaming for no reason. I will admit however that after about the halfway point, it tends to get a bit better. I do admit that the aliens themselves are genuinely terrifying, simply due to the fact that even in the film they have a strong Psychological influence over anyone they want to control. As another critic stated, the film seems to jump back and forth between an ordinary Science Fiction flick, to one of those ""lost footage finally uncovered"" films, because a good part of the film is shot from the perspective of one of the teens. The film leaves quite a few questions unanswered however, and the end is absolutely infuriating."
" UFO enthusiasts will like it . . . others - not so much.
",0.5994,0.9823,2017-04-07 00:00:00,7,"I scored the film quite highly because I genuinely enjoyed about 80% of, but I went into it knowing it wasn't exactly going to be a groundbreaker.Without wanting to give too much away, it incorporates a lot of UFO mythology and people who are into that kind of thing will probably enjoy it, as I did. The special effects are very well done, for a film without a huge budget and the UFO's are genuinely ominous and 'other - worldly'.The plot isn't too bad really, it ends in an interesting way that you probably won't expect and there are some scenes in the last 20 minutes that are actually quite spectacular.It's bad points though - the actors are a bit annoying and not very endearing. The main couple are quite nice and their story plays out well, but everybody else in it seems to just be there to add filler to the plot. One of the guys in it is actually very annoying, from start to unfortunate end.It's all a bit loud and flashy and over the top in parts as well. The musical score is definitely not up to a very high standard in my opinion.I think it deserves a little more respect than some reviewers have given it - but not much. ;-)"
" A different approach
",0.0,-0.9538,2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Though this film reminds me of Fire in the Sky on certain levels it did however manage to capture an essence not found in modern day abduction genres. Extraterrestrial is about a group of young folks who take to a cabin in the woods for a small holiday so Kyle can propose to his girlfriend except now as he is turned down a mysterious fire ball streaks across the night skies and crashes. Up to investigate the group finds the site only to learn it is an alien craft but without a crew. Soon grotesque killings start along with abductions which dwindles the group's size to just two survivors.I like how it ended. Though Kyle, and his girlfriend do get put back alive, and well... the idea that the aliens dropped them off near a military command post said that if they cannot kill them by their own means then it could be done by masked soldiers who cleaned up the site in order to cover up the incident, which included killing both Kyle, and his fianc√©e. Buried along with evidence no one would ever guess that a night in the woods would never happen at all. Michael Ironside who played Travis the ex-marine from Vietnam was a nice edition as the pot growing paranoid freak who lived in the very same woods. It stood to reason that it was the governments fault all along, and that an arrangement had to made in order for technology to be bartered just to extend the agenda for those in absolute power.It had moments of fright, visceral torture of Seth who only wanted to go home, and seeing inside of the alien craft that made me think that there are those who travel among the stars that do not see it as we do. Extraterrestrial is a statement which says... Not all aliens are friendly, that our existence is remnant of just cattle, and the owners are the US government along with their off world cohorts. The music was a nice touch with gritty songs of sorrow and sadness. All in all a nice flavoured movie all round."
