" a SOLID movie
",0.3254,-0.966,2021-03-19 00:00:00,6,"For me, the strength of this movie really lies in the acting. All members of the family and the villian are really really compelling. And then there's the very disturbing elements; I'm used to seeing movies with disturbing elements that have spotty acting, but movies that have very disturbing elements with immaculate acting are rare.6.5, but lost .5 because of a boring and cliched hollywood ending:**minor spoiler**When the lead stabs the villian in the final scene, it's made out to be this huge dramatic thing despite looking very stupid. The music swells and crescendos right at the moment of attack, the villian is killed by a weapon that is super ironic; it's really just crap. Thankfully it's only like 20 seconds of the movie. And while all this cliche crap is going on, everyone is being engulfed in flames including the lead's daughter, so maybe MOVE YOUR ASS instead of having your cliched dramatic hollywood moment. Yea, it was stupid. But every other aspect of this movie is awesome.It's also important to note that this is one of those super rare movies that really EARNS your fear. There are approximately ZERO ""loud noise"" jump scares in this one. We don't have time for that childish bs here. It's all just creepiness to the max, and I loved it.""Relic"" is another one of these movies that earns your fear, and I highly recommend."
" Surpsingly Impressive!
",0.5562,0.8939,2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Great little horror/thriller. Fun plot, excellent performances, and decent writing. Was entertaining all the way to the end credits. My only gripe is that goddamn CGI fire in the third act."
" A total waste of time
",-0.4215,-0.9759,2021-02-14 00:00:00,4,"There is something very curious about this movie : how can it be so high rated while also beeing so bad ? I really can't understand that. Alright, anyway you just have to watch it and you will see how terrible it is : bad acting, bad story, bad filming, plus atrocious music that will make you cringe... or turn off the sound !
With the best will in the world, there is nothing to save in this movie. Sometimes bad horror movies can be fun, unfortunately this one takes itself seriously. The only positive point is that it lasts only 79 minutes, even if it seemed to me twice as long."
" Very well-made, original horror film
",-0.3368,0.9693,2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"The story is original, the characters are original, and thrills are ongoing. The cast is great and the acting was very good. I really wish it was longer. There are lots of threads that could have been developed more, but weren't. However, overall, everything they presented was great. Edge-of-your-seat type of thrills. Definitely see it."
" Wasted potential.
",-0.4939,0.0407,2020-11-30 00:00:00,3,"It starts off very well and builds some expectations, but wow do those expectations fall so hard by the end. And the ending... It's probably what completely ruins this movie. I think it would've been a solid 5-6/10 if they had done a proper ending, although it still would've been a big wasted opportunity. This is far from ""horror gold"" like some reviews will tell you here, I recommend skipping this one, unless you like being disappointed."
" Rubbish.
",0.0,-0.9451,2020-11-29 00:00:00,1,This film is just bad on so many levels. The main character is just pathetic. The daughter is aite. The wife is irrelevant and all in all just bad. The ending just killed me off. Rubbish.
" Pretty good until the last 20 mins
",0.7269,-0.9011,2020-11-26 00:00:00,4,"It starts out very bland. A happy family moves to a haunted house in the countyside. A metalhead painter dad with his metalhead daughter. A very cool family indeed.
The devil^s servant mid-aged bald and out of shape guy breaks in and assault the girl and kidnaps her from the school and almost kills her on the bathroom floor of a motel room but she manages to escape the last minute thru the window.
Then the miraculous things come up: the policemen killed in front of the house of the family by the devil' servant, dad get shot in the lung but walks around, his daughter and he stay in flames and an explosion but they just do not burn and dad finds the bodies of the victims of the devil's servant buried in luggages by the house. A very happy ending after all"
" Average house slasher flick
",0.0,-0.8888,2020-11-14 00:00:00,5,"A family of drug addicted metalheads who are so condescending and self-infatuated are in a house that is haunted? Well it isn't really, just that someone who went crazy used to live there. I hated the characters, and I wanted the demonically possessed guy to kill them all. Oh no look you have to paint butterflies for a job, boo-hoo now everyone has poor taste but us. Seriously?Anyway, the imagery is OK and it is creepy enough in places. But the final attack on the house made no sense and there was too much screaming and loud noises to enjoy any of the tension. The music, such as the constant heavy metal is grating on the ears and not to my taste at all; and added nothing to the plot. The daughter character is annoying, and she acts way too serious for a little kid.The ending makes no sense and nothing is revealed at all, just implications that the main guy is special or something; like he is supposed to be some sort of metal head jesus.5/10 should have been better."
" Best horror movie in years maybe decades!! AWESOME!!!!
",0.3956,0.6279,2020-10-28 00:00:00,9,"Phenomenal story incredible cast extremely well directed, great soundtrack this is going to be a classic with a definite cult following my only complaint is I purchased the DVD should have purchased the bluray!!! This is a permanent addition to my extensive horror collection!!BRAVO!!!!"
" The devils candy cane!
",-0.6114,0.9691,2020-10-23 00:00:00,9,Wasnt expecting much from the trailer. Just a friday night horror to chill to and pass the time but WOW was i shocked and pleasantly surprised. The acting is great and the story line is gripping from start to finish. It doesnt drag and gets straight to business and the ending is nail bitingly suspenseful. You will be screaming at the tv during the last 5 minutes. It was like a heavy metal version of the witch! If you like satanic films with an artistic modern metal twist i highly recommend this original horror film.
" Satanic/Metallica Horror
",-0.5719,0.9245,2020-10-23 00:00:00,9,"This is a dark satanic movie, really good and uniquely creative with its story. The movie is filled with lots of metal music which matches the characters personalities and makes you feel already familiar with them. The creepy satanic parts are great, and keeps you gripped throughout. I love movies like this, that have no random boring ""filler"" scenes."
" Very intense, well made horror movie
",-0.1849,-0.7695,2020-10-10 00:00:00,9,"This is a very well made horror film, the horror is very psychological and you get a feeling of dread through out the film. It follows a family and a serial killer but there is something else going on behind the scenes, is it mental illness, is it the devil?You feel as though this dark force could be using this family and everyone else as pawns for ifs own amusement.Very good acting and the characters were great. Vince was a very believable killer and you felt for the family throughout the film."
" The Devil's Candy - 8/10
",0.0,0.9886,2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"I've known about The Devil's Candy for a while now and just never really got around to watching it. After seeing how divisive some of the ratings were, I decided to finally check it out for myself and I'm glad I did. This metal-infused horror movie from Sean Byrne sees a painter and his family relocate to a new house, but shortly thereafter strange voices and visions take hold of him and his painting makes a turn for the satanic. Just as grim, but slightly more complicated, than Byrne's previous film ""The Loved Ones.""To go into more detail would be giving away spoilers and I think this movie would be best seen going in blind, but be warned, some of the subject matter was a little grittier and more disturbing than I expected, but I wouldn't say it goes to far or anything. You could say it's a possession film, but it's not like any others I've seen and it feels very grounded in traditional Satanic themes.There's also an awesome soundtrack here that fits the movie perfectly. In fact, you can see the musical influence all over this film, from it's metal-loving father-daughter duo, to the NECA bobble-head of Kirk Hammett that they keep on the dashboard. Also, the camerawork's pretty good and there's a slowness to it that helps build up a feeling of unease.Overall, I had a good time with this. It's violent and dark enough, but leaves the most gruesome and disturbing parts up to your imagination. Ethan Embry is great as the painter and he has some really badass scenes, which is only helped by his grizzled appearance and tattoos. The movie does lay out most of the answers for you, but the devil's presence is pretty open to interpretation and never really honed in on, which I kind of liked. Worth checking out given the runtime, but I definitely wouldn't have complained if it was a little longer."
" I made this account to say not to waste your time watching.
",0.3252,0.0,2020-08-23 00:00:00,1,"Above says it all, I watched about half of the movie before I had to start fast forwarding to the end."
" A satanic posession movie that elevates itself.
",0.0,0.6348,2020-07-09 00:00:00,7,"The Devil's Candy was a pleasant surprise for me because it used effective acting and atmosphere coupled with a better than average script. I can't say too much without giving away the twist, but let me put it this way. You ever wonder what God's doing during the events of The Exorcist or The Omen?"
" Vastly overrated
",0.0,-0.0516,2020-06-11 00:00:00,3,"I had high hopes as this film utilises a lot metal music. which is great.BUT, near zero horror elements, the only real horror stuff is the dad painting spooky things...which is then picked up by a studio with a spooky name...which then doesnt seem to go anywhere.A whining daughter doesnt get picked up from school and Pruitt Taylor Vince is relegated to a deranged former tenant role - a bit of waste of talent.The best aspect is the old Metallica played over the end credits. Otherwise, its just a bit of hostage porn. Yawn"
" A decent man versus Satan showdown of a movie made in the true spirit of heavy metal music
",0.5423,0.8921,2020-04-22 00:00:00,5,"An artist moves into his dream home along with his family, but ends up possessed by satanic forces in Australian filmmaker Sean Bryant's follow up to 2009's The Loved Ones. Your enjoyment of this movie will depend entirely on your tolerance of heavy metal music. The dad and daughter are both huge metal heads, they wear Metallica and Slayer T shirts and have a Kirk Hammett bobble head on the dash of the family car. A serial killer played by Pruitt Taylor Vince plays doom metal riffs really loudly on a Flying V guitar in order to drown out the satanic voices he hears. Doom legends Sunn O))) were responsible for much of the movie's foreboding music. It received its premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival."
" Underrated horror movie worth checking out.
",-0.4215,-0.4215,2020-01-23 00:00:00,6,Underrated horror movie worth checking out. Also staring the kid from Can't Hardly Wait.
" Acceptable movie, though more about a killer than about possession
",-0.507,-0.1901,2020-01-04 00:00:00,6,"Simple but well executed with acceptable performances. It oscillates between the possession movie and the psycho-killer movie, although the latter feature is the most dominant. The supernatural possession just works as a explanation for the (human) actions that actually create tension and horror."
" Boring
",-0.3182,0.1298,2020-01-02 00:00:00,4,"As much as you want to like this headbanger's flick, it feels poorly constructed and formulaic. Painting as the outcome of a painful, preverbal and primal form of ""inspiration"" is such a ridicously sedimented romantic trope that""s impossible to escape, here it is taken to absolutely ludicrous heights."
" How are his vegetables?
",0.0,-0.9244,2019-12-07 00:00:00,5,Not a generic or particularly annoying horror. Just a rather forgettable one that never really finds its stride or any of our raw nerves.It's hard to know what else to say about it. It's story of familial harmony being strained under mystical obsession is sort of intriguing but it never stayed with me. There's a lot of heavy metal and macabre paintings to make up for the lack of chills the plot delivers. Horror should never mention that heavy metal exists. And it shouldn't rely on false images of macabre. It's just a cheat.The only really memorable thing is a rather striking performance as the Satanic Guitarist.
" ""I Need To Come Home, Now!""...
",0.0,-0.8192,2019-11-25 00:00:00,8,"Artist / heavy metal enthusiast Jesse Hellman (Ethan Embry), his wife Astrid (Shiri Appleby), and their daughter Zooey (Kiara Glasco) move in to their new, rural dream home, only to discover that it comes with a... complication. The Hellmans already know about the house's tragic past, but have no idea what caused it to happen. They are about to find out.THE DEVIL'S CANDY is a supernatural horror movie that works. It's what movies like THE AMITYVILLE HORROR should have been. Gruesome, macabre, and terrifying, TDC's effectiveness stems from its having authentic characters who are caught up in occult / demonic possession madness. Said possession is presented like a form of extreme schizophrenia, making it difficult -at first- to discern whether dark forces are truly afoot. While the finale takes a curious turn into action film territory, it's not enough to offset what came before it.Co-stars the always wonderful, Pruitt Taylor Vince as the VERY creepy Ray...P.S.- This movie has a great soundtrack, too! Extra points for the GHOST poster on Zooey's bedroom wall!..."
" Solid tension
",-0.1779,-0.8154,2019-10-26 00:00:00,7,"This is a short movie, my clock recorded only 70 minutes or so. Despite taking a while to get moving, the early part of the movie syncs some metal to proceedings and it works well. Alas, the metal sync disappears about half way in, not to reappear again until the credits. That was a shame. I would have loved the filmmakers to try and attempt a full horror movie with metal all the way. Still, it's not as if the movie ceases to be entertaining half way, quite the contrary. There are some tense moments indeed. This is a competent horror show, no-one will feel ripped off, but I can't help wondering if more couldn't have been made of the story, filling in to 90 minutes or so. And I missed the metal. Maybe next time ..."
" Solid disturbing horror outing
",-0.7506,-0.7351,2019-10-20 00:00:00,7,"This was a movie that gave me what I want from a modern horror film. A basic premise with a disturbing twist. I loved the art and music aspect of this and how, instead of it just being there, it contributed to the plot. I was sorely disappointed by the ending, which felt a little abrupt and not as dark as I wanted it to be. Besides that, it was the perfect length and a worthy, if a bit disappointing, contribution to the very mixed bag of the horror genre."
" A Bi-Polar Horror Movie
",-0.5719,0.7713,2019-10-17 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie. The acting was top notch. The scenes had a great sense of foreboding and spookiness. I loved the music and imagery. So much of this movie works.At the beginning, I said that it was going to be another ""house with a dark past"" movie. To some degree that is right. However, it diverges into two separate stories that really are not linked well. First, we have a story of temptation by the devil. This story has some great acting and great images, but it ultimately doesn't go anywhere. The devil turns out to be completely inept.The second story is stronger and links to the house's mysterious past. It has some tragic horror elements to it, but is best when it leaves the supernatural element behind.With better focus, this movie could have been one of my favorites. As it is, I was disappointed with the neatness of the end."
" Some kind of metal version of Amityville Horror?
",-0.5719,-0.4095,2019-10-01 00:00:00,4,"The disturbed man-child from IDENTITY plays another disturbed man-child who began hearing (and listening to) demonic voices in his parents' house, which continue to haunt him after he moves into a hotel. When new people buy the house, demonic stuff happens. *fart noise* Ugh. I probably would've given this a lower score if not for my little crush on Ethan Embry, who is the only reason I watched in the first place. I was annoyed that his character is constantly disheveled and sweaty, but this was apparently required to make the viewer understand that he is a serious metal-head. He really, really likes heavy metal, you guys!"
" Digital nonsense
",-0.4019,-0.5968,2019-09-30 00:00:00,3,"THE DEVIL'S CANDY is another cheap, cliched, predictable slice of digital nonsense with no redeeming factors so far as I can see. The whole thing was shot in the dark with zero lighting so good luck trying to make out what's going on. A family move into an old house and find themselves harassed by the great Pruitt Taylor Vince, the son of the previous owners. Poor old Vince deserves better than this. It all descends into shrieky torture porn-style shenigans, complete with bad CGI FX and a particularly unappealing lead in the form of the heavy metal-loving father."

I found this to be well acted, well scored (some classic metal tracks here), it has some good, fluid camera work and a few effective moments of horror. The only thing I think that let it down was the lack of backbone to the Satanic aspect of the story.
They say that the Devil has all the best tunes. He certainly has better movies than this."
" Disturbing

" ***DISTURBING***
",0.0,-0.8268,2019-07-17 00:00:00,8,I added this movie as one of the best horror movies of all time in my list. The movie is quite different from any normal horror flick. The director lets your mind do the unimaginable thinking by not showing the gore parts which makes it really disturbing. I bet most of the people who watches this movie had sleepless nights for some days. It gives you chills from the start till you are lying down ready to go to bed.
" Embry is definitely an underrated actor...
",0.4019,0.923,2019-06-18 00:00:00,8,"I honestly did not even realize who he was until I came here! ... That said, this movie was better than I thought it would be! Some seem to have misunderstood parts of it. As one other viewer said, the voices the protagonist and antagonist heard were 2 different voices... The one that the father (Embry) heard was one of warning... Where as the other hears a demonic voice... That alone makes this movie different from most that have used Metal as a focal point in horror.That said, I absolutely loved the score being partial to metal myself (Metallica in particular) and the acting was excellent all the way around. It was definitely not what I was expecting or how I was expecting it to play out upon reading the summary. In a good way! I figured it would be another ""Man gets possessed and slaughters his own family"" type of deal... It was a nice change in that sense. As was the real fight being between people and not against some demonic force that takes possession of others or form of its own. Leaving you not quite sure how much was real and how much was in their heads or warning premonitions. Either way, as disturbing as it was it was definitely worth a watch."

This is a fast past and open minded film that you have to wraparound the barriers of being possessed by the devil and the inner strength to overcome the devil himself.
Does it have some loose ends?
A few.
But it's easy to add 1+1 to know what the point of it is.
Is the ending so far fetched and over the top of comprehension for the closed minded individual?
Absolutely.
(Maybe the openminded also).
The plot is there and not hard to follow.
The acting is good and the possessed is possessed as you would expect and creeps the movie throughout.

Obvious and massive plot holes which cannot be filled are relied upon to fill the narrative.Fat weirdo in rural area snuck into our daughter's bed and tried to kidnap her...

Anyway, artist and family move into a new house, and he hears voices telling him to paint disturbing stuff. Meanwhile a really messed-up dude is on the loose, with a connection to said house. They might run into each other at some point. The artist is played by the kid from the 1991 movie Dutch, back when Ed O'Neill (who's not in this movie) had hair.

" ""This film could serve as mankind's best look at the beast himself""
",0.6369,0.9249,2018-10-24 00:00:00,9,"The Devil's Candy is written and directed by Sean Byrne, being his second feature film. To follow such a strong horror movie like ""the loved ones"" could have been difficult and lots of times u see directors second horror feature stoop in extremity and terror, but Sean Byrne's ""the devils candy"" is a very intense and powerful horror film with a terrifying overall feel. In my opinion it is better than ""the loved ones"" but definitely not more gory or graphic. Although much is shown off screen, I would still consider ""the devils candy"" to be an extreme horror film due to its dark ideas and mature themes. The cast is great and all do a fine job acting. Ethan Embry is perfect in his role all grungy and greasy and Kiara Glasco is phenomenal for this being her first film. Oh, shes also very pretty and is going to grow into a beautiful woman. Pruitt Taylor Vince plays the disturbed and psychotic Ray and he gives a chilling performance as he comes off as strong, confused, and unpredictable. He is really the driving force of terror here as the horror entirely revolves around him but this creates a very unique horror movie experience. This movie is indie but the best of its breed and one of the best IFC Midnight releases in some time. You can tell its created by a director with a strong passion. The only thing I can possibly criticize is the fact that the back story is never fully developed and when the movie ends there are many questions left unanswered but then if u sit and dwell u can kind of get to the bottom of some of the unanswered questions. Theres a big hole in the story as far as how is Ray Smile just running around if he is so crazy. I understsnd he went to juvie as a kid and got out, but if he was living with his parents at the time of their death, wouldnt he be the biggest suspect and figured out? The house wouldnt be for sale so soon and if it was awhile after, why was Ray stop wearing the same outfit and look as if it was just overnight? Usually this is a reason to drop a skull or star, but in this case the overall awesomness of the film makes up for the few plot holes. I now saw this movie twice and will watch it again before long. Id say 8 out of 10 stars but id say 8.5 if i could."
" Effectively Disturbing
",-0.1027,0.8212,2018-10-23 00:00:00,8,"This is a no frills, straight to the meat and potatoes kind of film. That's one of the benefits of having a short runtime. Once it's set up, it moves right along in a very creepy and effective manner. The acting's great, the film looks excellent, and I was honestly a little disturbed. That doesn't happen very often with me, so it gets point from me for that alone.Sounds effects play a big role in making this film work. Which is something I often fell is underutilized in horror. It can also be overdone, but this manages to find just the right balance. While the whole cast was great in this, Pruitt Taylor Vince makes this film what it is with his disturbing portrayal. It's so simplified, that it actually adds an extra layer of creepiness.If you haven't seen this yet and like well done, creepy, effective horror you should give this one a view.My Rating: 8/10Effectively Disturbing"

" The best Horror movie I've seen in years!
",0.2003,-0.6404,2018-10-10 00:00:00,10,"I don't write reviews - this is my 2nd one ever and I watch a lot of movies - I like the horror genre, but there are SO many bad one's out there I'm disappointed 9 out of 10 times - this was the 10th time. I can remember seeing this movie for rent on Amazon before, but I was put off by both the title and the cover - it looked like a cheap slasher flick. Usually the acting in them is so bad it's almost funny - if it wasn't so painful to watch, lol, and I can hardly ever relate to the characters that I don't care if they get their head cut off, and in some cases I'm rooting for it because they are so one dimensional and wooden it's like they are a Star Trek redshirt. And I don't like metal either - but the characters in this movie - the family, ring so true that you wish they were your friends or your friends were like them. I actually had to stop watching at one point when the daughter ... well, I won't leave a spoiler - let's just say I didn't want anything bad to happen to them, and I honestly can't remember when that's happened before.
It's not full of impossible jump scares, the fear and feeling of unease, that something is wrong, slowly creeps up on you, until you find yourself tensed up with your toes curled up. 
I am really glad I gave this one a chance - and it was because of the reviews here - normally, if a horror movie has a score over a 6, or even over 5.5, you'll find a lot of reviews that seem like they had to have been written by the crew of the movie, or one of their mom's, so that was another shocker, the highest scoring reviews seemed well written and thoughtful. This is a movie I think I'll end up buying because I know I'm going to watch it again. I don't get why authentic horror movies like this do worse at the theaters than found footage or a movie where the unseen human purely evil antagonist somehow also is a computer genius and can break into a chat room then find and eliminate the other characters as if by magic. Sometimes it's good to go into a movie and willfully suspend your sense of disbelief, but you don't have to do that with this one - so get a bowl of popcorn and a six and your movie buddy and be prepared to see the best horror movie you'll see all year - it's just that good."

It's not a TERRIBLE movie, but it's also certainly nothing above the ordinary. I can enjoy heavy music just fine, the music itself is not my beef here, but the whole ""heavy metal = satan"" is crap. It's just lazy. There's no real suspense, we can't see anything, and cool tattooed dad paints butterflies with kids' faces and many-eyed goats and all that = scary satan stuff, is just tedious. Andy Williams songs would have been more jarringly disconcerting. (OK, maybe not a great choice.) Nah, sorry.

" The bitter taste of lameness
",-0.5574,-0.9613,2018-05-19 00:00:00,3,"Honestly, the fact that the dude behind the amazing The Loved Ones started out with such a solid premise - and then proceeded to squander it with an unforgivably lame and worthless anticlimactic last act - means it deserves a way worse scourging than anything half-baked executed with spirit.This brew contains some heady ingredients: Texas, Satan, art, metal, a haunted house, a fat psycho in a tracksuit... From the unflinching brutality of his other film I mentioned, you'd think this sort of setup would be taken to all sorts of demonic extremes. But all the good ideas fizzle out and go nowhere. The haunted house, for instance - the worst it ever makes our painter protagonist do is lose track of time! The most fleshed out detail in the film is the family dynamic, but even that's vague and one-dimensional. Not to mention annoying. The minor characters are bland and completely forgettable. Even a good sense of place is missing - some locations have little congruity with another. Eventually, this is all drowned out by the boring and stupidly improbable climactic act. You'd think the entire area has, like, two cops. Or that you can be shot through the torso and still manage to get up ladders and beat people with creative objects. If this movie wanted to have some family dynamics gluing it together, then it should have gone in a very different direction - and gone there all the way. But it was way too scared to go there it seems. Too bad."

" You're cheated by this movie; characters not relatable, odd choices for actors.
",-0.3265,-0.9838,2018-02-28 00:00:00,3,"This movie seems to be produced or written by a speed or death metal music fan.
The writers infuse at least three characters with metal as a defining interest, yet this does not relate well to the suburban family setting.That was the confusing introduction to the primary characters.The rest of the film is slow to develop. Its difficult to tell who is possessed by what. The characters are flat, and the choices by the director for actors is odd. The primary character, a father , is heavily tattooed and resembles modern interpretations of Jesus. He listens to terrible music and paints mediocre art. His daughter is a cliche of a teeneager who listens to Metallica and dyes her hair purple. She wears the same rock and roll t-shirt get up throughout the movie. At least the costume people didn't have her wear a Ramones t-shirt as in the movie ""Mama""! Total cliched people, but not relatable to a family living in a farmhouse in Texas!The plot of this movie stretches credulity, especially in the ways the local sheriff handles the crimes in this movie. A known madman allowed to roam around freely and stay at a local motel? The known suspect from a serial murder spree not monitored though he lives in a town of less than 1000 people?Its difficult to take this movie seriously. There's the requisite religious imagery that is so popular today in horror films, and chanting voices and of course death metal, but all this thematic effort is overplayed and wasted. The CGI fire scenes are not convincing and the injuries sustained by the protagonists should be fatal!Horror fans have got to expect more from productions like this; cosmetic flourishes and iconic imagery combined with ""edgy"" characters does not a movie make."
" The Dull Devil and his Candy
",-0.7964,-0.9042,2018-01-31 00:00:00,3,"The Devil's Candy: Written and directed by Sean Byrne.This movie was highly recommended on various review sites. I saw it pop up again and again. I finally gave in and decided to watch it. Demons and heavy metal got my attention. I enjoyed Deathgasm and it seemed like this might be in a similar vein. It is not that at all. It is a slow paced artsy style horror movie that feels like it might be a supernatural haunting film. Right from the very beginning, the movie starts to lose me. This family moves into this great big farmhouse in rural Texas. It's in the middle of nowhere and they have only one car. It's as old as dirt. It's the station wagon from Vacation. The mother talks about taking the bus to the salon where she works. The dad is an artist. There's no way they can afford this house even with a murder taking place there dropping the price down.This movie loses credibility from the get go. It has me asking questions that I really should not be asking. The heavy metal stuff doesn't play as integral a part in the story as it seems from the beginning. It is just character dressing. It tries to make them different from your average person who finds themselves in this situation. It's a little unsettling in the presentation. I did enjoy the camera work a bit. But this movie is a lot of window dressing. It is a generic home invasion story with devilish elements. It is a short film but it feels so much longer. It is a dull movie. I simply can not recommend this one. Try again another time. I give this film a D."
" Very well above average
",0.3384,-0.9479,2018-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Metal music and horror .. although metal is often adorned with kind of horror or satanic imagery, for me personally .. those two things do not necessarily go together well.Well, here it does work. There is good chemistry between the father and the daughter (not so much the father and wife though) .. the acting in general is exceptionally well done. The movie is visceral and does not shy away from showing a lot, yet leaving a lot yet to imagination. In contrast with so many other horror movies, this one offers bright, vibrant colours, loud music and a family that actually seems to work well enough.All in all, the movie was fun to watch, not really scary though. There are no ""real"" jumpscares .. which i appreciate .. and the effects were subtle enough.However it is not without flaw .. it suffers from the very same problem most horror movie storylines suffer from .. poor communication between the characters.. for some reason the people in most horror movies fall for the very same tropes over and over again ... they do not openly talk to one another. It is just one of the points that i do not like much in horror movies.But i can fully recommend it as a suspenseful crime movie."

",-0.25,-0.5203,2017-12-01 00:00:00,7,"A film about Satan and the devil, how classic. There's an undercurrent of pure dread to this flick. It works its way through the film's veins using music cues, whispering demonic voices and haunting images. Ethan Embry's performance is superbly crafted. A well-meaning dad, that rocks out to metal and paints pictures all day. He feels very real and not like a caricature. (He also gets ripped for this flick, I guess because he paints shirtless for a few scenes. It seems unnecessary, distracting and unfitting for his character but sure).He begins to hear voices and see things and paint horrible stuff he doesn't understand. It's all very unnerving and convincing and seems to be leading to some inevitable catastrophe.But the film lets up in the home stretch. It becomes a bit of a supernatural home invasion flick. The film seems undecided about whether there are real demons at play, which unfocuses the movie and makes it seem unsure of itself. The film isn't exactly about investigating the place demons have in the modern world either. It just knows they are inextricably linked with metal. A lot of the build-up seems for naught in the end and it's a real shame. Byrne has great ideas, a wonderful grasp of character, atmosphere, tension, but maybe not enough to say?"
" Rather impressive and enjoyable haunted house effort
",0.4767,0.991,2017-11-22 00:00:00,10,"Moving into a new house, an artist and his family into a remote house and slowly succumbs to a dark, sinister force within the house that affects not only his relationships with everyone else but the quality of work he starts creating which soon puts the rest of his family in extreme danger.This was quite the enjoyable and chilling effort. Among the fine points throughout here is the fact that there's a typically creepy and chilling location at the heart of the film. These films are based on the type of setting being utilized and this has a spectacular one, as the old-school wooden construction, large open spaces and general feeling of darkness seeping through the walls of the house which creates quite a strong and chilling impression. That's even before it starts in on the houses' history that includes the original backstory and the overall manifestation that pops up throughout here with the ghastly voices whispering continuously in his head that brings out the new style of painting in his artwork. The slow descent into madness he finds himself as the artwork becomes darker and far more intense inspired by the time in the house is an exceptionally enjoyable slow-burn storyline that pays off nicely here with the way it works itself out in the darker paintings he creates. When it slowly starts to dawn on everyone that he's falling into the same traps as those who were in the house before him which lets this one maintain a rather creepy feeling throughout here. Once it begins to invoke the concept of the intruder coming into their lives who invades their lives in one of the finest scenes here in his botched invasion attempt which is a chilling concept that gets utilized effectively in here and leads into the emotionally draining and charged final half which just enhances this one with a flurry of disturbing concepts, frantic action and a truly vicious streak that's fun to watch. How it plays off the brawling and stalking taking place in the burning house gives this a strong element of action while the burning walls leave a fine visual impression during that time and create a truly enjoyable and memorable image at the right time. Given that this one manages to incorporate all this into the stellar family relationship angle at the heart of it all makes for quite an impression as well, and given the fun pace and quantity of gore these here all make for quite an enjoyable time here. There isn't much to bring this down, which mostly stems from the overall lack of conventional haunted house tactics throughout here. This one goes for the subliminal in their scare tactics rather than throwing tons of jump scares out there, and that might be somewhat problematic for some who go for a more traditional pace. Otherwise, there's not much else to hold this one down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and mild drug use."

While it's not perfect, it hit ALL it needed to and never overstayed its welcome.What started off as a roll-of-my-eyes quickly redeemed itself as the plot veered far away from the old horror movie tropes. A family moves into a bargain of a house after a murder had taken place. Not your average, every day murder, but that's the whole point.Naturally, they family (Mom, Dad, Teen) are not well off, but they got some artistic dreams. While the father hears stirs of echoes in his head, the most obvious creepy stalker of kids finds this teen as his latest obsession.There's a lot going on in the plot, but mercifully, the straight arrow – the one most interesting to follow – is on target to get this nicely wrapped up with an ending I always crave, though rarely see. Highly recommended. It feels small, low budget and simultaneously ambitious with what they were provided. Definitely a must for horror fans. Totally rocks!***Final thoughts: Here's another I missed during my horror-movie-month obsession of October.

There's a feeling there was more that could've been built on here and while it's nice Byrne lets us make up our own backstory as such, more time spent on his characters and building the groundwork of his story would've done wonders for a film that intrigues with its originality and set-up but ends up culminating in a fashion that feels like somewhat of a copout for what's come before it.Final Say – A promising and sporadically brilliant sophomore feature from Australian native Byrne with a killer soundtrack, The Devil's Candy is another fine calling card for the local director and hopefully another stepping stone for him on his way to a genre classic, a feat you can sense is well within his grasp.3 axe guitar's out of 5"

It stars Ethan Embry, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Shiri Appleby and Kiara Glasco. The slasher flick tells the story of an artist, and metal enthusiast, who's finally able to purchase the property he 's dreamed of, in rural Texas, for him and his family (the Hellmans). Things take a turn for the worse though when he starts to hear voices from satanic forces, and a former mentally unstable resident returns home. The film received an indie theatrical release at the Box Office, and it's now available on video and VOD. It's also gotten almost unanimous positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it. A struggling artist, named Jesse Hellman (Embry), is finally able to afford the dream house he's always wanted, in rural Texas, for him and his wife (Appleby) and daughter (Glasco). The property is a steal because of the fact that an old couple died there. What Jesse and his family don't know is that the couple was killed by a very mentally unstable former resident, named Ray (Vince). Ray has been hearing voices from Satan, for some time now, and he shows up at the house wanting to return home. Jesse also begins hearing voices, which affect his art as well. The movie is really effectively directed. It's creepy and quite disturbing, without ever showing much graphic violence. The lead performances are also all good in it (especially Embry) and the characters are also all likable too. The film is definitely a very well made little indie horror flick. I'd certainly recommend checking it out."

As a music fan, I was impressed by the soundtrack and was more impressed they got the rights to a Metallica song!

This movie is impressive enough as it is, but knowing it is only the director's second film makes it even more so.The story centers primarily around an almost unrecognizable Ethan Embry as Jesse, the grungy, long-haired, metal-loving, art-obsessed patriarch of a small family. Despite the fact that it means he will have to sell out a bit, he's ready for them to move into their first real home, a large farmhouse in rural Texas with an expansive barn that he envisions as a studio. His preteen daughter, Zooey (Kiara Glasco), is frustrated by the expected growing pains of starting at a new school, and his wife, Astrid (Shiri Appleby), is hesitant when she finds out that the too-good-to-be-true low price is due to the previous owners dying within the house's walls but onward they go. No time is wasted before Jesse starts being ""inspired"" by inexplicable urges and one of the previous tenants makes an unwelcome reappearance** SPOILERS! **I was hooked in to this film from the very first minutes and that's rare. The styling, the mood, the dread-heavy guitar riff I loved it all.Metal is featured heavily — almost exclusively — and the father-daughter bond that Jesse and Zooey share over their love of Metallica and headbanging in the car is really goddamn cute. I feel like I'm so used to seeing either fathers and sons bonding or fathers fumbling through trying to connect with their daughters that this was a refreshing departure. Zooey is beautiful but unapologetic with her style, and there's really no mention of her ""not fitting in"" aside from the universal apprehension to start fresh at a new high school.The entire thing felt sharp in a way I haven't experienced in a while. The acting felt natural, each of the characters seemed like they were well-cast, and the run-time was short enough that I never got bored or antsy. At only 79 minutes it was both pleasing to my ADHD mind that tends to bounce around if it has too much freedom to do so (and even when it doesn't) and impressive that Byrne was able to flesh out the characters so much in such a brief span of time.Everyone was fantastic, but Pruitt Taylor Vince — playing Ray, the possessed son of the house's previous owners — stole the show. As with many actors, I first discovered him in an episode of The X-Files (Gerry in ""Unruhe""), but he has a huge list of previous projects. He managed to be sinister and yet almost pitiful in a way, especially with it being unclear just how long he had been tortured by these growling, menacing voices. He brings such an understated sense of tension to every scene he's in, particularly the feeling of panic you feel when hearing his blaring guitar riffs (his futile attempt to drown out said voices).The concepts explored are vast and complex. We center around the idea of Satan being an ""active, violent, anti-God personal reality"", a force that moves through humans rather than a goofy cartoon character with red flesh and horns, and then segue seamlessly into the fear that every parent has of someday not being able to protect their child from all evil. We see Jesse dealing with feelings of inadequacy on all sides — not being able to support his family even when he compromises his artistic values, especially when it comes to his daughter, who, with age, is becoming increasingly skeptical of his ability to do (and provide) it all. Not to mention the juxtaposition of intense artistic inspiration being a form of ""possession"" in itself, with Jesse only able to get the attention of the high-end gallery owner when he completely loses himself in his work, at the expense of his family and their trust in him.And the final scenes? Oh man, the final scenes. I wouldn't have imagined myself loving watching Ethan Embry kill a man with a Gibson Flying V while flames encircle them and metal music rumbles so loud you think it will explode the TV itself so I learned something new about myself today.It's like a haunted house movie merged with a possession film and dressed up in the style of a serial killer flick and I freaking loved it."

This movie sucks you in immediately and you're stunned when it's over already.Ethan Embry and Pruitt Taylor Vince are just awesome in this.

Excellent movie!"
" This movie is metal
",0.0,0.954,2017-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Here's a good, creepy movie for you. A family moves in to a house cursed by The Devil, and the previous occupant returns to carry out what the demonic voice in his head tells him to do -- which just so happens to be the same voice the father hears that compels him to paint horrifying scenes.There's a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle things that make this movie really great. From the metal soundtrack, with all of its connotations to devil worship all the way to names and roles of certain characters and locations referencing the biblical devil, a lot of thought and care was put in to making this movie work on more than one level and flow together great.Rarely is the movie too heavy handed. The supernatural elements are treated with such a deft hand that it's almost possible a case could be made that this movie isn't even supernatural at all. It's there, around the edges, creeping in to your head, but never getting in your face. The scariest monsters are always the ones you cannot see.And, at its core, what really matters are strong characters. Though a lot of the family in this movie are metal heads, there are no stereotypes here. These are real three dimensional people, and they care about each other very much. It sounds so obvious, but you'd be surprised how many movies forget to make you invested in their protagonists. Not so, in ""The Devil's Candy."" If you're looking for a horror movie with a strong sense of personal style and you like heavy metal, I definitely recommend The Devil's Candy."
" The Metal-est of Movies
",0.0,-0.577,2017-10-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a surprisingly skilled and great looking indie horror film that far exceeds the confines of both independent and horror cinema. The cinematography, the sound design, Embry's character's supremely dark and unique artwork, this oddly authentic family going through hellliterally. And the horror is so real and empathetic, it's all the scarier for it."
" Intense and metal as hell!
",-0.68,0.9867,2017-10-01 00:00:00,7,"The Devil's Candy is a movie about a family that consists of a couple and a teenage daughter who move into a new house. Father and daughter are really into metal, father is also a painter and it's like he gets possessed when he's painting and he paints all this nightmarish imagery. There's also this creepy man who kills children that starts stalking the daughter and basically, it gets a bit messy.The main problem with this movie is that the plot just doesn't come together well. The possession part completely takes a backseat (even though it was shown a lot) and is never really explained, so we have a story about a family being stalked by this very creepy satanist serial killer who kills kids and thinks he sends them for the devil. It's like two plots and one unfolds while the other one is just kinda left hanging in the air. There could have been more, but there wasn't and it doesn't really hold up well.That's a pretty big flaw, but I liked everything else about the movie. It was well directed and very, very intense. I'm talking biting your nails kind of intense. It also has some sudden very disturbing moments that might be a bit too disturbing to some, but that's a win for the movie. I was surprised by how little gore this movie contained, but still it manages to shock so much in certain moments, so props to the director. The acting was also one of the best I've seen in indie horror movies for a while and it really helped bring us closer to the characters (father and daughter in particular). I wasn't prepared for how good the acting actually was. And also, the movie is pretty stylish and I felt that the director really brought that sense of a nightmare. And if you like metal, that's a good enough reason alone to watch this. The soundtrack and some of the themes are a metal-head's wet dream. And while I'm not a complete metal-head, I'm quite fond of metal and I must say that I really enjoyed those aspects of the movie.So, this movie might have had a weak script, but it was saved by good directing and strong performances."
" Potheads As Protags?
",0.0,-0.926,2017-09-19 00:00:00,1,"Immediately the viewer is asked to see a pothead family of three as protagonists, which is nearly impossible for most people since the whole lifestyle smacks of drug use and rebellion. This film in the first five minutes showed me how I, a former drug user and alcoholic, was once seen by people with their heads on their shoulders instead of so far up their asses that right seems wrong and wrong seems right. I just can't get behind any character who represents a societal dumb-ass with no intention of changing--and worse, with every intention of raising children with the same amorality."
" Unexpected
",0.0,0.9826,2017-09-17 00:00:00,8,"Do not pay any attention to rating and description on IMDb, cause they have nothing to do with reality. Although it uses well known horror premise, this movie is completely different than what we are used to. It last only 79 minutes and builds excellent atmosphere from the start, and then maintains tension to the very end, end atypical for genre. In my opinion, this is drama and thriller as much as it is horror. Story is simple but vivid, characters are unusual but convincing, acting, directing and camera are great, and music and sound effects are perfectly fit. And it uses music by few of my favorite bands. I loved it.8,5/10"

This movie was well done, lots of original material, well crafted cinematic horror, good acting, good plot, actually reasonably scary and suspenseful... it's a solid horror movie. I recommend it strongly to other horror fans and trust me I don't give that recommendation out easily, there is plenty of 'horror crap' out there, but this is horror gold. Good job."

The way you're supposed to be after watching a truly amazing horror movie. I wasn't sure what to expect as I'd never heard of this prior to watching it but I certainly wasn't disappointed. Beautifully shot, great acting, highly tense situations. Great film, definitely recommend watching this one."
" No coherent story to carry 80 minutes
",-0.296,-0.856,2017-08-15 00:00:00,3,Well made but virtually no coherent story that makes any sense. Somehow moving into a house a psycho that is alive used to live in makes the new resident have a connection with the psycho?! HUH?! Why? The last 30 minutes of the story was just a jumbled mess. Sometimes the psycho is just a human and other times he seems invincible but in the end he died and everyone manages to get out of an inferno unscathed. Just really dumb and I have no idea why people are giving this 10 and saying 'must see'.
" Cast Are A Cut Above
",-0.2732,-0.336,2017-08-12 00:00:00,7,"A really enjoyable horror, apart from all the dark scenes where even with all the lights out, curtains drawn and squinting like mad I struggled to see a lot of scenes, especially in the first 30 minutes. This is as annoying as straining to hear the dialogue when the music is blaring away. The story is credible albeit it lost some credence in the last 15 minutes and I would have been happy with and extra 20 minutes to flesh out the ending which seemed a bit rushed. However, this is a great watch, particularly and mainly down to the excellent cast. Normally in low budget horror the acting is atrocious, but the acting in this was way above average and carried the film."
" Great horror movie!

It is a nail biter, because Ray, despite how easy it is to feel sorry for him, is a very dangerous individual! I felt so scared for Zoey from the moment Ray showed up at his childhood home, pathetically asking to be allowed to live there again! Jesse is a great dad, who truly loves his daughter, despite his love for his art, and always tries to be there for her! I loved this movie from beginning to end!"
" Chilling!
",-0.1007,0.7269,2017-08-08 00:00:00,9,It is incredible to me that this is only the sophomore outing for Director Sean Bryne and there is no slump here.From the opening scene I knew this movie was going to be good. Pruitt Taylor Vince portrayal of Ray was incredibly creepy. After the film was over I was still thinking if he was truly possessed by the Devil or if he was just going crazy.I am happy I was finally able to view this film as I have heard about ever since it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival back in the Fall of 2015.
" The ending is just a disaster.
",-0.6249,-0.936,2017-08-06 00:00:00,1,Of course I'm not going to spoil it but it is sad that people will have to find out for themselves how dumb the end of the movie is. The whole last 15-20 minutes or so are just tragic. I suspend disbelief and love terrible exploitation movies but this.... I was eye rolling the whole last part of the movie.
" Not all that bad
",0.431,0.9125,2017-07-31 00:00:00,6,"I went into this thinking it would be another cheesy horror flick that did not impress me. It wasn't really cheesy and it had a couple familiar faces. The little kid from Dutch all grown up and rockin out. It wasn't gory, more of a psychological thing. Wasn't sure exactly where they were going with it. Not sure I understood the ending. The VERY end I mean so I would love for someone to fill me in on it. I would not watch it again mainly because it did not bedazzle me. I felt like it was definitely done on a budget. Long story short I am not much on devil movies because they usually come off as cliché. This one was average. To sum it up? I did not love it nor hate it."

",-0.0572,0.9534,2017-07-23 00:00:00,6,"The film starts out great introducing us to a heavy metal family. The head bob scene with the bobble head was priceless. The home they buy is haunted. Jesse Hellman (Ethan Embry), our heavy metal painter, hears the same unintelligible ""do ra-dee stee ter"" as did Ray Smilie (Pruitt Taylor Vince) whose parents died there, and now he is back. The film runs through the formula, gives us a Peter Townshend inspired ending, an ending that makes you say ""Noooo!."" It was intense, mostly because it was overly impossible.They created great characters, played with them for about an hour and then turned what was going to be a great horror/thriller into something inane. Not as bad as aliens in an Indian Jones movie, more like ending of ""Sharknado"" unbelievable.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."

But I never came across this flick so I had to see it and finally I did. I can understand that it won prices, for me this was indeed candy, to be honest it's a gem.Even as there's no gore or nasty moments it still gives you an unpleasant feeling. Due the way it was edited, the use of the camera, the soundtrack and the use of heavy metal, all of that makes it worth seeing. And did I mention the acting? All are above mediocre. Is there something bad too, for me it there isn't a thing but I can get it that some will turn it off due the way it was hot or due the atmosphere built. It's not your average horror but if you are open for a anti-Hollywood way of horror without many effects but purely based on the disturbing stuff then this is a must see. Underground geeks will overt, I did...Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

" Strong first half but leaves most of it's themes largely unresolved
",0.2846,-0.9996,2017-06-11 00:00:00,5,"I watched The Devils Candy largely on a whim and i can't say i wasn't entertained throughout it's run-time. As someone who enjoys a wide variety of horror movies - from slow burning psychological horror movies, slashers and outright gorefests i found what ""The Devils Candy"" was offering up competent but also incredibly forgettable. I've read that other reviews found it's ""subversion"" of classic horror tropes (haunted houses, possession, serial murder) satisfying and refreshing but i just can't see it. Maybe I've grown jaded, but from the movie's poster to it's opening title screen I thought I was in for something that would delve more into genuinely unpleasant territories.The movie tells the story of a metalhead painter taking his wife and equally metal obsessed teenage daughter to live in their new home in Texas, a house where the death of an old couple has taken place. Turns out the dead couples mentally-challenged son, who is implied to have some connection to satanic forces leading to the death of his parents, is roaming around the town, turning up at the door of the house not long after the family moves in. He plays a guitar loudly in the preceding sequences, presumably to keep the voices of what I can only assume is Satan from taking control of him and making him murder. He then leaves the guitar with the family, which then leads to him targeting their daughter despite his wishes not to hurt her. The movie deals well with the family's relationships. The father is a caring man, and seems to only want to please his wife and daughter despite continually messing up. He is driven to deface his original paintings, by either the acts of the killer son or the devil himself (I'm unsure) turning them into satanic images which then gets him a deal with a gallery (named the belial gallery - great symbolism guys!) but at the cost of his daughter (something the gallery owner drives home in a painfully obvious scene, stating ""nothing great comes without a few sacrifices"" to then make a toast ""to sacrifice"" as the daughter is kidnapped by the killer elsewhere). The scenes shared by father and daughter are genuinely engaging, and promises something more complicated than what the movie eventually delivers. The resolution with the killer storming the house and shooting (but not killing) the painter and his wife seems muted, something more akin to a bad terminator knock-off than a horror movie. I can suspend my disbelief in moments where characters with gunshot wounds shrug them off to fulfill their roles in the last act - I understand that having the main characters getting shot through their torsos brings ambiguity to their predicament, leaving the audience hoping they'll make it to the end safely, but from the general tone of the movie I was surprised they did. The killers motivations is left largely unexplained. Nothing is hinted at or playfully hidden in subtext, he seems to kill children solely because the devil tells him to (""they're the devils candy""). The killing is off-screen, which considering the fact that he targets children is weirdly inept. It seems like they where going for some sort of shock but it never delivers - unless you feel dread at the implied murder of uncharacterized children who have no screen time as anything but murder victims, and serve no purpose but to be killed off-screen to drive home that he murders kiddies. I understand child murder would evoke a pretty strong reaction from an average movie-goer, but i also feel like this is exactly what the story is taking advantage of, as we are never really shown anything that is genuinely off-putting. It's like the child murder was included to up the ante rather than to showcase anything of actual meaning. The killer is shown eating candy before the one solitary murder scene, not exactly layered imagery. I can make presumptions about the children serving as sacrificial lambs to further douse the movie with religious imagery, as the painter dad kinda looks like Jesus, i guess? And a goat is spotted in the back yard to allude to the devil being present, maybe? Or maybe metalheads have a tendency to have long hair and beards, and maybe a goat is about the most cliché thing to just ham-fistedly put in your movie to illustrate that ""the devil is here"", and maybe a fat guy with reduced mental faculties would just drive around eating tubs of candy.At no point does the movie go into any real nastiness. Nobody is killed beyond one disposable child and two cops, and these killings are handled as if it was aiming to be a PG-13 horror movie. There is no brutality to the violence, no point to any of the killers actions beyond feeding the devil his favorite treats, and no real consequences to the pain he inflicts on the protagonists. It's a shame, because the acting is good, the pacing is slow and engaging, and everything is competently shot and put together. Even as a story about Jesus protecting his family from a satanic acolyte with a double-digit IQ it delivers on few things, making me wish for a more realized movie with more consistent themes. The metal music seems included merely as an aesthetic accent, and beyond the killers first two scenes playing a red V guitar (which to my delight he keeps insisting he has to ""play. loud."") and the licencing of a few metal songs it has no impact on the movies tone or story. I hope I eventually realize I've watched a severely cut TV-version of this movie so I can finally understand why it's so highly rated on IMDb and rottentomatoes (disregarding the fact that it has less than 40 reviews/ratings) and maybe even watch it again. It's an enjoyable 80-minutes of squandered potential that i'd rather not repeat, even if it had featured more actual horror."

You could sell this as a family drama too.But of course it is horror and it has the shock moments to prove it. What it also does, is mix up art (as in painting) and some weird psychological mystery into a really good story. The family works nicely and it is all very relatable.

The entire cost was awesome - Embry gives Oscar-worthy performance, and I think he has one of the most expressive faces on the Silver Screen. Vince never disappoints, and proved to be a most emotionally tortured villain. He gets glimpses that what he is doing is BAD, but he cannot overcome his demon. The daughter is incredibly likable - not an obnoxious smart-a** like the character's of so many kids in movies these days. At first, I found the wife dull, but she rocks, and gave a great performance. I disagree with some of the others that this was not gory. It was quite gory and violent, both in imagery and played out scenes. This movie flew by in no time - you won't even have time to get a snack. It brings forth the notion that people -both good and bad - can summon up strength we never knew existed within us. To what purpose do we want to use it?"
" Sweet!
",0.5093,0.4651,2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Ray Smilie (Pruitt Taylor Vince) hears voices in his head, commanding him to feed children to the devil (i.e., chop them up, stick them in a suitcase and bury them). When struggling painter Jesse Hellman (Ethan Embry) and his family move into Ray's childhood home, the child killer targets Jesse's teenage daughter Zooey (Kiara Glasco). Meanwhile, Jesse falls under the influence of evil forces that compel him to explore darker themes in his art, including a prophetic image of terrified children, one of which resembles Zooey. As the movie progresses, Jesse's obsession with his new painting causes him to put his family in danger, his art coming before their safety, and a Mephistophelian art dealer tempts the artist with success (and brandy), distracting him just long enough for Ray to abduct Zooey from school.From Sean Byrne, who gave us the excellent The Loved Ones back in 2009, The Devil's Candy is a smart, tense supernatural chiller that benefits from terrific performances, confident storytelling and a large helping of heavy metal, Jesse and Zooey's musical genre of choice. As a fan of both heavy metal and Satanic horror, I loved all of the movie's little details: father and daughter casually throwing each other the devil's horns gesture, unaware of the evil forces at work around them; Jesse, looking more than a bit like Christ, being tempted by an agent of evil (the art dealer's business is named Belial); the metal posters Zooey loves so much adorning a wall where a crucifix once hung (extra points awarded for including a poster for Ghost, my current favourite band). All in all, The Devil's Candy is a thoroughly entertaining movie, even more-so if you're a headbanger (I even watched to the end of the credits to listen to Metallica's 'For Whom The Bell Tolls')."
" A Deal With The Devil
",-0.6597,0.9626,2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"The Devil's Candy is a predictable but likable film. I mean predictable in a good way. The cast of this feature presented themselves very clear and concise, meaning that you kind of knew what they were all about. With all that being said, the family felt very real and fluid, Ethan Embry is portrayed as someone you may look at twice on the street, sort of a ""Devil's Reject's"" look to him. But the father figure he presented to us was done very well. Pruitt Taylor Vince was creepy in all aspects, he has that sort of demeanour about him. Kiara Glasco that played as Embry's daughter did a great job, very believable. The word believable is the important thing here, that is what makes a good film, the characters have to be believable. There was a bit of bad CGI at the end but forgivable. Movie characters that may seem similar would be from the film Body Parts(1991), meaning Brad Dourif's character. Also the hard metal aspect to the film is a character in itself. There has been a long history of rock musicians making deals with the devil, a very interesting concept that this film delivers. It may not be perfect, but the characters were developed well, and I think the score and cinematography saves the film in the end."
" Disturbing
",-0.5106,0.3564,2017-04-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie is tense, disturbing, with some heavy imagery, gripping, and has great acting. It's not so much scary as it's disturbing - different things, the way I see it. Watching it was an intense experience. There's some lack of imagination in the underlying plot, in portraying evil and how it acts through people, but I guess that this would be asking too much of an already good movie. It lacks subtlety in key moments. Decisive scenes where the main theme of the movie are discussed are presented hurried way; they aren't properly explored. To be fair, this shouldn't be generalized, though. But I do feel the focus ended up being too much on the unfolding of the actions - a classic goal to goal rather aspect to aspect sort of thing.The scarcity of good horror genre movies is really saddening, few artists are willing to delve into the nature of fascinating subjects such as evil and fear, but I'd say this movie is one of the good ones and I definitely recommend it."

While not the most original of stories, the movie was an impressive debut, showcasing the talents of the young director. Fans of the film have waited, patiently, for a follow up from the director, Sean Byrne. It took him six years to make another movie, but my god what a movie it is.THE DEVIL'S CANDY is a haunted house movie, it's a possession movie, it's a serial killer movie, it's a metal movie and it's an artistic psychothriller all wrapped up in one canvas. There are so many things about this film that could have gone so wrong, but Byrne makes so many good choices along the way that it all ends up working incredibly.We open with a little bit of backstory, an odd man, of the Baby Huey variety, hears some very demonic voices. His method of drowning them out is to fill the air with the sweet sound of reverb guitar, blasted through his Marshall amp on a Flying V (those will both play integral roles to come). Mommy doesn't like the noise this late at night, though, but our disturbed rocker doesn't like to be told what to do. Fast forward to a family looking to buy the home. Dad is an artist, wishing to create art that reflects his dark interests, but stuck making butterfly commissions to pay the bills. His daughter is a little protégé rocker and Mom plays that role of the one stuck being the responsible one in the trio.Very early on, we start to see that all is not right in the house. Dad starts zoning out, awash in visions, which are resulting in some very dark and disturbing art that is also some of the best work he's done. The distractions are causing him to lose his tight relationship with his daughter, who is struggling at school and has become the fascination of our Baby Huey, which is where the plot strands start to tie together. The movie is an exploration of family, with a great cast who are not your typical Brady Bunch, but have their own tight bonds. This is, also, very much a rumination on evil. We look right into the eye of evil throughout the film (in literal ways) and the movie plays with the ideas of Satan and the devil, without ever resorting to the sort of cheesy pentagram lore that ruins so many indie horror flicks with lesser writers and directors. We have human evil, in the form of a child killer. We have symbolic evil in the name of the art dealer. We have very supernatural evil taking place within the house. All are forms of the devil. The movie culminates into a tightly woven finale that pits our family against the killer and plays cleverly with an idea that even something that might have seemed evil can be used for good in the right hands.The direction by Byrne is superb, using some broodingly dark images that could have seemed totally cheesy in the wrong hands, but work to craft a uniformly consistent aesthetic here. Ethan Embry is someone who has never really shown me much before, but does a great job of playing a father who starts unraveling and losing control. The soundtrack is excellent, using metal music in a way that doesn't feel like a tacked on 90s soundtrack, but makes the metal part of the core of the film, including some great ambient noise by the group Sunn O))))). I heard so many good things after this screened at HorrorHound and was pleasantly surprised that it met all of those expectations."
" Standard horror movie
",-0.5719,-0.9661,2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"There's enough going on to capture your interest but it's all done to the horror movie formula so there's no surprises.The direction is quite good. The acting and sets are fine. However, there's just too many plot holes to tie it all together.No real explanation of how the artist, (who is a Jesus look-alike metal head), is possessed by the devil (or is he just channeling the killer? Or is he psychic? Yeah, see, there's lots of questions and few answers here.Points given for atmosphere but lots taken away for the formulaic way the puzzle was put together. A bit cringe inducing in places and irritating nonsensical actions in others.Misses the mark, but watchable if you have nothing better to do."
" There's a reason that you never heard about this one
",0.0,0.9716,2017-04-12 00:00:00,3,"I'm a big fan of the Loved Ones, but this is just hot garbage.Filled with one cliché after another that sound like they're out of a Lifetime TV-movie, this film just piles on one generic trope after another disguised as ""Metal"" which comes off more as ""christian rock"". This is the type of film someone's square parents would make and call it ""edgy"".Each and every piece of symbolism blatantly smacks the viewer over the head like it's desperately seeking attention. ""Hey......did you see how the main character looks like Jesus?""........yes.....everyone saw it, understood the obvious symbolism, and yawned.Not sure what the director had in mind here, but I would bet that his next project is going to be on a much tighter budget. Perhaps he would be better served with a focus on remakes........much like some bands are better playing covers."
" There will be always a demon inside us
",0.0,0.795,2017-04-08 00:00:00,8,After this movie if anyone said they never scare demon they probably lying.The Devil's Candy (2015) directed by Sean Byrne is one of the best underrated horror movie i see this year.The plot of this movie is very genetic: A family moving in a house with a deathly history and the situation get very messy in the end but the thing help this movie stand out among of other cliché horror movie is the craft and the fantastic performance of Ethan Embry and Pruitt Taylor Vince.This movie not only a good movie for horror fan but also a movie for Metalhead when it featuring many great heavy metal song with a heavy Satanic symbols themes.The last arc of this movie which i not want to spoiler but it the best horror final scene i see in a long time.It seem like i praise this movie a little too much but when you look back this year horror movie you will be quite surprise to see how many horror series get reboot or being milking and how little original movie are make.
" Loved it!!
",0.6688,0.9878,2017-04-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie was excellent! I was almost put off by the cover, like another reviewer on here, but I'm so glad that it didn't stop me from watching it. Every single actor was amazing. There wasn't a dull spot in the whole movie and I loved it. It was one of those movies that when you finish watching it, you're energized because it was so well done."
" Sigh. Had such good potential...
",0.4588,-0.8463,2017-04-03 00:00:00,4,"What, to me, kept this film from earning higher marks was simply how silly the plot and direction turned out to be. I get that the father was weak and spineless (No gun in the house? In rural Texas? With a wife and vulnerable young girl in the sprawling, relatively isolated house?), but was he so weak that he couldn't fight off an overweight burglar? How'd he suddenly gain so much strength to suddenly go running through a burning house if he was shot several times and left for dead?The part about how the father came to be able to channel the killer's darkest, murderous thoughts on canvas needed explaining, too. How this is possible is a mystery, since Fatboy is just a regular human being who spent many years in a psych hospital for attacking local school girls with a brick, his M.O. Somehow, being in the hospital all those years endowed him with supernatural powers. The Pluses to this film was the ability of the studio to license Metallica songs. And the fact that the titles were written in Iron Maiden lettering doesn't hurt, either."
" Simply necessary
",0.0,-0.1264,2017-03-31 00:00:00,9,"Just watched it, and it blew me away, I will probably be thinking about it for a while, no doubt the best horror movie of 2017 so far, great performances, interesting characters and full of moments that will make you very uncomfortable (in a totally good way).. not mentioning the amazing sound track, see the family driving listening to Cavalera Conspiracy and headbanging was something. The relationship between the daughter and the father was so genuine and interesting that I just felt that I wanted even more of that, making this my only complain about this movie. If you into horror movies and also likes heavy metal, that's your movie, I absolute recommend."
" Horror Worth Watching
",-0.4215,-0.8414,2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Wow a great Horror Movie. I was slightly put off by the cover art of this movie and almost missed this one thinking it was a slasher film, it is not. I am not a fan of simple gore slasher movies and I visually categorized this as something akin to ""Devil's Rejects"" which is the type of movie I despise. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a good review of this movie which made me pick it up. Anyway, this may be one of the better horror movies of 2015. Pruitt Taylor Vince performance is very memorable and disturbing. Everything from his demeanor to that dirty red tracksuit. Ethan Embry (Late Phases, Incident on a Mountain Road) is no stranger to horror films but I barely recognized due to his long hair and grunge rock appearance, he gives an outstanding performance of a disturbed painter and father who receives an overwhelming urge to paint a sinister painting that is invading his mind. Interesting to note, the voices that the antagonist and the protagonist are hearing are NOT THE SAME. They are different which I think becomes apparent by the end of the film. This movie is full of tension with strong supernatural undertones. There is surprisingly little gore in this movie though we see multiple scenes of bloody aftermaths."
" A true sinister horror film with a tight script, solid direction n good performances.
",-0.3182,0.8615,2017-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Sean Byrne shud b applauded fr giving us a solid horror film aft his long break. I hav yet to c his torture porn, The Loved Ones. I saw this on a DVD. In this he had combined elements of haunted house, possession, home invasion, mental illness n a tale of Satanic influence. This movie is a truly frightening, tensed, well acted, well directed with a tight script. The Texas countryside is gorgeously captured. The farmhouse n the desolated fields were creepy enuff. The plot is nothing new but the execution n direction was superb. A family – a struggling painter with his wife n daughter move into an isolated Texas home which is on the market cheap because the former owners died..... Ethan Embry gives perhaps his best performance here and looks like he's probably in the best shape of his life. He was totally unrecognizable here from his previous roles like the ones from Late phases, Vacancy, The guest. But it was Pruitt Taylor Vince's performance which was tremendously disturbing n sympathetically innocent, as well. He shines as the most terrifying serial killer considering his deeds n innocently sympathetic fella considering his looks n physical n mental condition. I remember his performance from Identity n Captivity. The movie is complemented by pulsating musical energy. The soundtrack helps ratchet up the tension. The two things, the source of the demonic voice and the local art gallery is not fully explored. Nonetheless, the voice n the art gallery, specially its owner n the receptionist set up as a sinister n surrealistic imagery. The art gallery owner reminded me of De niro from Angel heart n the movie does hav shades of Amityville horror, The Shining, True Detectives S1, etc."
" I thought this movie was fascinating
",0.5423,-0.9969,2017-03-28 00:00:00,7,"""This is different. I've never had a muse before. I don't remember painting this. It's like it's, it's like somethin'.. It flowed through me.""I won't beat around the bush. I thought ""The Devil's Candy"" was unparalleled. And not because of the demonic story itself. But because of the appearance of Jesse Hellman (Ethan Embry). A true metal-head who throws himself, stripped to the waist, on a canvas cloth with spray cans during the night. A prehistoric looking guy with lank greasy hair, gleaming because of his with oil smeared muscles. He tries to put the energy he receives from listening to squealing and howling guitars into his artworks. In a way he reminded me of Rob Zombie. The day the family Hellman (appropriate name!) decides to move into a sweet-looking little house somewhere in Texas, Jesse doesn't realize that the dark forces that are present there, will inspire him in a very different way.It's never really frightening so to speak. No paranormal events or sudden jump-scares that'll spook you. The eerie part is developed in a more subtle way here. The demonic character of a former resident who's either possessed by satanic forces or simply mentally disturbed, is the thing that makes for some scary and eerie moments. I'm talking about Ray (Pruitt Taylor Vince). A somewhat fuzzy and labile-like person. Not long after the Hellemans moved, this retarded person shows up at the door and claims that he needs to return to his former home, so he can produce a deafening sound on his red Gibson Flying V again. Noise he needs to produce in order not to hear those adjuring voices. Voices that incite him to perform disgusting acts.Although it's a horror, it's not really bloody. You can imagine what dreadful murders are happening. And at some point when Jesse is painting again, you'll see fragments of red paint mixed with seemingly bloody fragments. But it's never explicitly shown. There are moments when you can feel the helplessness of a future victim. The powerlessness and the realization what's waiting for them, provide an uncomfortable feeling. Ultimately, you can ask yourself the question whether it's really Satan who's ordering Ray. Or is he just a mentally disturbed person who hears voices and is guided by them. More or less it's explained a bit by the preacher in a religious television program. Satan isn't only that metaphysical character with horns and a pointed tail. It's not only that mask that's being worn at Halloween or the character you'll see in a movie. It's an aggressive anti-Christ who lives among us and uses us to carry out his unspeakable deeds. In a less religious context it simply means the evil that proliferates in humans.The story isn't very original, but the undertone of the film is fascinating. The fact that the film is filled up with brutal metal sound, creates of course an extra satanic dimension. Personally I still think it's absolutely ridiculous, but the association of Satan with metal is never far away. Well, probably there still are some blockheads who think that Ray's actions are a result of listening to heavy metal. Ultimately, the film balances between a psychic, demonic story, and the story of a serial killer who's guided by an evil influence. I thought it was fascinating enough anyway!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" A bad horror movie if you really think about it
",-0.802,-0.8082,2017-03-27 00:00:00,2,"Thru out this movie my intention was to rate this around 6 or 7. But the more the movie progressed I realized that it depended to much on character development which in the end didn't pay off.A lot of the horror is implied and therefor looses a lot of shock value and a strong feeling of tension. Also the movie has a lot of plot holes and is really poorly explained. The whole movie thru I could not grasp how this was all connected or even what the point was of it all.The most tensed scene was the killer trying to set the girl on fire but that looked fake as hell (sorry for the pun)The actors and the chemistry between them was the best thing in this movie I blame the writing or the execution of it why my rating is so low.The same director made ""the loved ones"" and what I remember of it that's the better one by far.I hope to see all involved go on an doing something better and although i'm disappointed it is not a terrible watch.Maybe you get more out of this than me,if so...Enjoy."
" An absolute gem of a horror film...
",-0.5719,0.8853,2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"I have Chris Stuckmann, the youtube reviewer, to thank for putting this uncommonly good horror film on my radar. Also, I cannot recommend highly enough the excellent review here on IMDb from user jtindahouse - they have absolutely nailed on the head all of the reasons why this film works so well. Please do read that review...I completely agree with every point jtindahouse made.I have only one minor squabble - this film was just a tad short. In an era where so many films are overly, self-indulgently long, I wish this one was just a tad longer. Then again, the relatively short running time does lead to an incredibly tense experience, akin to reading a blisteringly paced short story or novella that you simply can't put down.Atmospheric. Fierce. Totally believable, likable characters throughout. Wonderfully shot. I simply can't see discriminating horror fans disliking this film.Highly recommended."
" Brilliant horror that never cheats
",0.3468,0.9816,2017-03-26 00:00:00,9,"The biggest problem modern horror films seem to have is making the audience care about their characters. Generally, they are so cliché, bland, dumb and unrealistic that within the first 10 minutes of the film no one cares any longer about their fate. So when I saw early on in 'The Devil's Candy' that the main characters were a family of hippy bogans, I'll admit I was worried for the sake of the film. I make no mistake about the fact that these are not people I can relate to in any way, and have had almost universally negative experiences with them in my life. On the contrary though, that turned out to be the strongest element to the film. I loved this family. They were charming, caring, relatable and down to Earth. I genuinely cared about their fate, and that is a large part of what made 'The Devil's Candy' a very fine horror film.The second thing I loved about this film is that is never cheats. No scare is a false one. Nothing is suddenly revealed to be a dream sequence. No super-natural elements were required simply to make the story work. That is incredibly rare in the history of horror movies, let alone modern ones. Writer/director Sean Byrne needs to be absolutely commended on this. It is a brilliant effort on his part.There really isn't a lot of negatives I can come up with for this film. The only thing holding it back from being a '10' was an unforgettable ending. Other than that it is basically flawless. Fantastic acting, a simple yet brilliant and effective story, genuine scares that never cheat and characters that are both likable and relatable. In an industry that is seemingly completely lost as to how to make a good horror film, 'The Devil's Candy' needs to be studied by everyone in Hollywood. It is a very good film."
" Devils candy is a unsettling masterpiece
",0.1027,0.9508,2017-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Where do I start . devils candy is a amazing indie horror film , from the cinematography to the great soundtrack choice. I found myself loving this movie the more I thought about it. Although this movie is most definitely not for everyone as it has violent towards kids and unsettling imagery , but this movie is a indie masterpiece and definitely going in my 2017 list of favorite movies."
" One of the most accurate portrayals of the devil
",-0.6597,-0.04,2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"The devil's candy is about a family moving in only to discover that they picked the wrong house, it's a place where Satan himself takes control. Does it pay off?Well considering this is a low-budget film, it's very impressive to see it done that good. It's well crafted and has a very eerie atmosphere. You won't be thinking about heavy metal the same way again after seeing this movie. Although there are some clichés just like any horror film,it still succeeds in being different and unique.The downside of this movie is the acting but it wasn't a big deal, won't ruin your experience.It's better to see it without knowing much so definitely go see it if you're a horror fan, it's one of the few movies that actually portrays the devil in a realistic scary way, will creep you out."
" scary stuff
",-0.4939,-0.0272,2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"this flick is not for the weak of heart. even as you see the holes in the plot, even when you're saying to yourself ""people don't act this way"", even when you ask yourself ""why don't they have a gun"", even with all that, you'll still find yourself horrified. it's scary all right, just as much for what you don't see. thankfully. jesse, astrid, his wife and zoe, their daughter move into a house where two people have recently died. jesse is soon hearing ""voices"" and starts painting weird tableaux, which find favor with a local gallery owner. I not giving any more away. just trust me. there will be times when you will just close your eyes. and there was a moment when I thought I would have to leave the theatre. it is very intense. and the thing is, incidents like this can happen in real life. bottom line-amateurish thriller. and you will be totally involved till the end. go. have fun."

In What it seem low budget locations and shots, The director seems to bring lots of emotions in his films from the main actors. I rate this one 8.6 and The Loved Ones 9.1 . As always, its best not to expect much and enjoy the movies."

A struggling painter is possessed by satanic forces after he and his young family move into their dream home in rural Texas, in this creepy haunted-house tale.OK first off, the movie starts and there's loud music and satanic voices but you can't see crap it's so dark. Not a good start. It literally goes on for three minutes and nineteen seconds. just horrible.Then there's all the loud music that is a substitute for anything good on the screen.It's such a distraction. And it really kills the movie"
" Was indeed a very metal horror film.
",-0.6096,0.9183,2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"The most Metal movie of 2017 so far.Although it's not hard for a horror movie to be metal, I feel a lot of them do without trying. However, The Devils Candy purposely does its best to be metal.Starting with a scene in which a man hears the call form Satan himself and then picks up a seven string axe and plucks it so deep it sounds like a bass riff, all in the name of the big D.The film is about a metal head who moves in to this man's house after he kills his wife than himself. This Metalhead begins painting disturbing images after hearing the Devil's call of the victims that that man's son, who is the monster of this slasher styled flick, starts to accumulate, and if this metalhead does not get his head right his daughter, who this monster has his eye on, will be next.Definitely appreciate the effort to be more metal. You have movies like Hellraiser (That just comes to mind) which is very metal with out attaching a Motörhead soundtrack for one of its sequels, and it's not even trying to appeal to the genre per say, like this movie does with the father and daughter bonding over their hate of everything cute and cuddly and poking fun of how light on the ears Metallica is.But definitely loved this more than most horror films these days that use cast that more appeal to the pop music crowd. Plus the movie goes for that no holds bared slasher horror feeling (Without getting too gory). This movie's monster's love of children (specifically the metalhead's easy on he eyes daughter) gives the emotion of that golden age Freddy Kruger, Micheal Myers era of slash without needing to actually see overdone kill moves.Completely disturbing, thrilling and suspenseful, and horrific without any of that.Devil horns up!http://cinemagardens.com"
" Better than the usual ""Devil"" films...
",0.4404,-0.9621,2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"Anyone as old as me will remember TV's ""Laugh In"" and comedian Flip Wilson's oft repeated line ""The devil made me do it!"" It became, like ""Sock it to me"" from the same show, a Buzz Phrase for the time.""The Devil's Candy"" certainly fits into ""the devil made me do it"" category as far as character motivation. Here the devil makes one character kill and another paint dark disturbing pictures of which they have no memory of painting. But rather than cliché us or bore us with the same old ""call a priest"" which we have seen a million times, the story plays out as a very human drama of one man dealing with what doctors would call a mental illness, and another dealing with an obsession that is costing him his family.Yet do not think the film is without chills. Indeed it has some extremely disturbing and violent scenes! However these are done with a modicum of gore and blood so they are not gross out horrors; rather than true horrors as they let you in on what is happening just enough to worry your mind.The film also makes a subtle statement about how we as a society fail to treat mental patients with violent pasts.Acting all around is top notch. Ethan Embry, Shiri Appleby (nice to see after not having seen her in a while), Kiara Glasco, and Pruitt Taylor Vince never once drop the ball; bringing us fully into their worlds."
" Disturbing on so many levels. The layers of fear in this are palpable.
",-0.7579,-0.9688,2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"Watching this movie, you get this sense that something isn't right. It doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the film, but the underlying themes presented within. The story of a demonic force that uses a persons talents as a means to channel evil is pretty original, but the way that the story just burrows under your skin like a lesion is just the tip of the iceberg. The acting is great, and each character carriers a nuance that is hard to find in the horror genre. The script is subdued, but what it lacks in any depth it more than makes up for in creep-factor. Like watching a satanic ritual as you hide in a corner, unseen, this movie forces you to witness madness, and how art can be used to channel some twisted and diseased emotions.This movie is reminiscent of The VVItch, in that both feature no real blood or gore, but still manage to disturb to the highest degree. The is no overt violence, but the few scenes that show it are haunting. I watched this film three nights ago and I am still thinking about it. That guitar riff has been sneaking its way into my dreams, and that in itself is an accomplishment. This is not a movie for everyone, and gore hounds will be sorely disappointed. What it is, however, is a private look into the mind of those affected with psychosis, and how the world seems to bend and warp around you as you battle mental illness."
" An Excellent Original Horror Film
",0.3182,0.9544,2017-03-18 00:00:00,9,"I was anxiously awaiting this film's release because I loved the director's previous film, The Loved Ones, and this movie had a really cool trailer. So I watched it last night and absolutely loved it. I really enjoyed how it played with a lot of the common horror tropes, as a result creating something very original and different. The set-up of the movie has been done hundreds of times, where a family moves into a new house after the previous occupants died. At first you think it's going to be something like Amityville, but The Devil's Candy switches things up by having the murderer of the previous occupants still being alive. There are also some very interesting things where it seems like the father, who is an artist, might also be hearing voices, and maybe the house is haunted, or perhaps he's just catching a glimpse into the mind of the crazed killer and/or his victims. Whatever it is, it's inspiring him and his art in a way nothing else has. So there's a temptation to embrace whatever's happening or fight against it.All of the acting in the film is very well done, and I loved how every character was unique. The father and daughter have a really interesting relationship, and they're both metal heads. The mom has a little less characterization, but she's still definitely not generic. The killer (that kind of looks like an evil Santa Claus) was great too; he was definitely a creepy demented person. My only problem with the film is that it is a pretty short movie at around 1 hour and 17 minutes. I would have liked a couple of more scenes with the family just existing before everything gets weird, or even more of a buildup of the evil presence or whatever it was before the end of the movie.Still, I'd highly recommend this film, especially if you're a fan of original horror movies. If you want to see my video review for the film, here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO9-dBTeClU"
" A remake of THE LOVED ONES, with a GREAT first hour, but then...
",0.694,0.9883,2017-03-18 00:00:00,5,"What I find maddening is how Sean beats his characters to death...but then they can crawl back from gunshot wounds, beatings, etc to rise up and save their loved ones. And these people are REALLY beaten row. In LOVES ONES, a drill to the brain, feet hammered to the floor and thrown in a cellar...and he can STILL do a full body pull up out of the cellar, drive a car at 140 mph (with those busted feet) and do all of this with a hole drilled in his head. REALLY? In CANDY, a room on fire actually explodes...and our two heroes survive AND can climb down the ladder---this after the father was shot several times. Sigh. It all is very disappointing but so well done. I hope Sean gets out of the horror genre and moves into thrillers since he's great with suspense. And he shouldn't write and direct his own films; he needs someone to day, ""This is just silly and needs to be cut/revised."" Like Ti West, he needs an objective viewpoint to help with the climax of the film. He can do a GREAT first hour...but then it just collapses. Terrific talent and I'll keep watching; just hope he doesn't make the same film for a third time."
" Fast-Paced Tale of the Devil Inside
",-0.6597,0.9972,2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"A struggling painter (Ethan Embry) is possessed by supernatural forces after he and his young family move into their dream home in rural Texas (just north of Austin), in this creepy haunted-house tale.First and foremost, this film deserves credit for working in the metal-horror connection. You don't have to enjoy metal to enjoy this movie, but I think it helps. One reason the 1980s were a great decade for horror is because it was also a great decade for punk and metal. ""Devil's Candy"" doesn't try to be an 80s throwback, but does offer something of a modern equivalent.Leading us through the film is Ethan Embry. Like many others, my love for Embry is strong. Not to pigeon-hole him, but he has been in a number of horror films in the last decade (such as the brilliant ""Late Phases"") and as part of the horror community I'd like to claim him as one of ours. Fans of ""Grace and Frankie"" may fight me, but we would all agree he is a great actor and truly underrate. Casey Affleck an Oscar contender? Really? Embry emotes with his eyes in way that few others can -- we have seen him sensitive, petrified, terrifying, and everything else. Some of that we see in this film (though luckily for us he is more on the good side this time around).And countering Embry is Pruitt Taylor Vince, who unfortunately is probably best known as a ""character actor"" who has one of those faces you have seen 100 times but don't know the name. If this is you, make this the movie you start remembering Vince for. Holy smokes. He has had a handful of ""idiot"" or ""incompetent"" roles, but he really turns it on here, making us wonder just how much he is tormented inside and having pity on him, even though we know within the first five minutes that he is a tool of the devil.The plot is thin, but not necessarily in a bad way. Rather than get bogged down or become too cerebral, ""Devil's Candy"" prefers to keep the pace moving so we can get punched in the face over and over again in its relatively short running time. You like cerebral horror? Great, we can watch ""Frailty"". This is not that film. But it is one filled with rich atmospheric cinematography and a dark, yet vibrant color palette (if such a combination is possible). With all due respect to writer-director Sean Byrne, it is cinematographer Simon Chapman who sold me on this film.The only thing that left me wondering, is why did the film take so long for a proper release? Beginning in 2015, it was floating around film festivals, receiving praise. The journey continued throughout 2016, and we finally see a release from IFC in March 2017. I suspect maybe it was securing the music budget, as getting the rights to put Metallica's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" on DVD is probably not cheap. But what do I know? Regardless, IFC must be thanked for getting this out to the masses. Perhaps not the best horror film coming out on home video this year, but I assure you it is far from the worst. Any horror fan who has 90 minutes to spare would be investing their time wisely with ""The Devil's Candy""."
