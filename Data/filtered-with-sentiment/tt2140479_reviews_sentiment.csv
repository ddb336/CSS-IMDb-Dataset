" Engaging
",0.34,0.9429,2021-03-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie is great. It's story keeps your engaged, and makes you do your own investigating.
Ben Affleck delivered an amazing performance that wasn't expected. The first time I watched this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was blown away.
As you get farther in you start to piece together the puzzle, and figure out how it all fits.
Figuring out Brax is his brother who also happens to be in the business of killing, or in actuality, protection, blows your mind. And I was able to figure it out before it was actually revealed to us.
J.K. Simmons adds to the story with how he knows ""The Accountant"", through his past run in and why he has wanted to figure it out before he retires. With the help of Agent Medina, he is actually able to do so.
Anna Kendrick is a good actress, and helped drive the story. Specifically why Wolff would want to stay behind rather than leave after being figured out.
Overall the movie is great, and the story is interesting.
It deserves 8.5/10."
" Doesn't add up
",0.0,-0.0644,2021-02-26 00:00:00,4,"An initial premise that could have led to exploring how an accounting genius leads a charmed existence amidst terrorists and major crime gangs cops out and comes up with the crass accounting that sees mental illness balanced with prodigious combat skills, a lethargic implied love interest and flaccid twists.

The final action scene is admittedly too long, yet didn't manage to ruin the overall impression.What sets The Accountant from the average action movie is a view on autism, showing that is isn't ""worse"", but merely ""different"" to what we consider normal.Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick deliver some fine moments."

" The Accountant review (2016, Gavin O'Connor) Autistic Assassin vs. Plot Holes Galore
",0.0,0.9816,2021-02-07 00:00:00,3,"The Accountant (2016, Gavin O'Connor)
If I turn off my thought process temporarily I can enjoy 'The Accountant' for what it is. At its core is a movie that sounds utterly intriguing. A high functioning autistic child raised by a tough love militaristic father is given hard lessons early on to teach him that he needs to survive in a world that is not designed to accept him. His autism leads to an outstanding mind for math and thus accounting yet somehow he gets introduced into the murky criminal underworld where he serves some very high profile bad guys while keeping himself safe from them and the authorities. Christian Wolff, our accountant in question, played by Ben Affleck, is brought in on his latest gig to dig out some possibly missing money from a high profile tech company sniffed out by an intrepid, young number cruncher played by Anna Kendrick. He finds the missing money in a predictably savantish way but also angers the bad guys attempting to disguise that fact. All the while he must also attempt to keep an up and coming FBI agent off his trail. So the setup all sounds pretty decent but if you engage your brain for any length of time the unbelievability of the plot becomes almost too much to bear. From logic leaps to coincidences to nonsensical devices it all weighs down this sleek product immensely. From the company who hired him, to the bad guys chasing him, to the pseudo love interest to the FBI attempting to corral him it all swirls into too convenient a package. Not too mention his savant skills at mathematics smoothly translate, perhaps too smoothly, into skills as a cold blooded assassin. But ah yes, his dad raised him and trained him to be hard. Problem solved. He is a badass seemingly without rival as presented here which, while good for the screen, is also somewhat problematic. Ben Affleck seems to play autistic like a normal person would think autistic people are and not like they actually area. Really he is just kind of socially awkward, although he can somewhat disguise that, he is very neat and his only affectation seems to be blowing on his fingers. I may not be giving him enough credit in this arena as they did have consultants who presumably advised him on how to act authentic. It is a tough sell though having a protagonist who really can't connect but in order to make him likeable and the story function they need to show him connecting to some degree. All the convoluted outlandish plot points lead to a few twist revelations that are so ludicrous (although predictable within the confines of the story) that they make you want to leave the theater laughing at their ridiculousness. So while have a very smooth, well intentioned, well functioning exterior including an amazing cast this film is so full of holes that it sinks faster than the Titanic.

" Unbelievable.
",0.2023,0.9871,2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"I rarely give high grades on movies.
But this one...An extremely important cast, an intricate storyline, full of ""WHAAAT?!"" moments.It's definitely one of those movies that deserves to be watched at least twice, to fully comprehend and enjoy its facets.Ben Affleck surely was one of the best choices to interpret Chris Wolf. Serious, emotionless, cool. Just perfect.
Probably, they could have developed a bit more Braxt story too.Still, I guess there could be room for a second chapter.Great movie, highly recommended."
" Great film

" A multi-level, interesting and surprisingly good movie!
",0.7959,0.9292,2021-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Somehow I was expecting a little more action, but even though I was disappointed with that expectation, the story and its growth story still succeeded.While I began to watch the action leffaa which this at least to some extent, advertised, then the first half of the drama, and trillerim√§inen half inspired, but of course this was the odd in the style change, which essentially the last 20min of actual operation.However, these factors did not live up to expectations too much, although it did not make this a very good film. I still recommend giving it a chance."

Also the story is kept asynchronously. Screenwriters have obviously changed in Christopher Nolan. In general the movie would turn out much worse if the leading role wasn't played by Ben Affleck. He pulls on himself all movie. What is strange, the cast isn't bad. The plot just turns rubbish when the rat in the company becomes clear. Totally ludicrous. Cinema on once."
" As good an action you'll get. A bit of drama, but that's worth it too
",0.5106,0.9485,2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"The acting is impeccable all round, if they do drama they do it well and it suits the story. Sometimes it's hard to include meaningful plot lines in action movies, usually coming across obligatory, paper thin or forced but implemented well om this movie which gave it a solid all round 'epic story' feel.The accountant creates not only great characters but a believable world from every perspective. I would be surprised if they don't take advantage of this for a sequel.TLDR
If you are after a classic dad saves the world Bruce Willis action or light hearted sort of action comedy then this isn't it.. but it does what it does well. If you like Leon (also known as 'the professional') and are in the right mood for a treat as such, you won't be disappointed."

Because telling the story would destroy too much.
This is not only a good actioner it has his silent moments; all actors are very good and I was glued ot the screen from the 1st minute.

As someone who has a family member with autism and I have a lot of experience with the Autism Spectrum, this film did not deliver.

Most disappointing."

While it isn't chock-full of surprises, it certainly contains some significant ones. And it has a solid and believable ending.If you like action films with a fair amount of gunfire, then this is for you."
" Simply put, I love this movie.

" Ten things you didn't know you could do with an abacus....
",0.0,0.9686,2020-09-14 00:00:00,7,"This is a bit of an hybrid of a few other films - a sort of ""Daredevil"" meets ""Good Will Hunting"" so perhaps that's why it works with Ben Affleck as ""Christian Wolff"". He is a whizz accountant well paid to sort out highly complex issues - of varying degrees of legitimacy - whilst acting as a sort of Robin Hood for some ordinary folks. When he is asked to investigate the books at a state-of-the-art tech company, he discovers a complex fraud that causes his extremely well ordered life to descend into chaos. It turns out that he had been an autistic child who, along with his younger brother ""Brax"" (Jon Bernthal) had been highly trained by their militaristic father and this training is now put to good use as he finds himself a target not just of the fraudsters, but also of J.K. Simmons' pursuing Treasury agents. It's a well constructed, exciting, fast paced - if unremarkably written - action thriller which Affleck delivers well with decent support from Anna Kendrick, John Lithgow and Jean Smart and with plenty of twists en route to a rather unexpected ending, it has plenty to keep it interesting. Maybe 20 minutes too long, though?"
" The success of this movie is due to the actor.
",0.5719,0.9573,2020-09-06 00:00:00,7,"I was drawn into the story even though it didn't really tell me what the main character wanted to do. I thought that Ben Alec is an actor who only plays very intelligent roles, but this movie made me rethink it. I was intrigued by this particular role so well that I was curious to see what would happen to him later, and it got even more interesting after about half an hour, when he does a job that he thinks he's going to do temporarily. That episode showed the potential of the protagonist, his character was clearly defined, and the objectives to be resolved in this film were established.
The story as a whole dealt with money laundering, and as I'm not a fan of money, there were parts that I couldn't follow. Does this mean that ordinary, straightforward businesses were helping the mafia to launder money? I felt like the details were more contradictory than I could understand, but... I was involved in the overall atmosphere.
I don't want to say too much about it, but I don't like the way the climax was built. It was boring."
" Ben Affleck as an on the spectrum killer accountant. If that doesn't draw you in...
",-0.6486,-0.8641,2020-09-03 00:00:00,6,"An autistic man (Ben Affleck) has an extraordinary ability to run numbers and is used as an accountant by legitimate sources as well as illegimate sources, where he fronts a money laundering business for the mob. A shadowy figure, he is also a killing machine, able to take out his enemies and those who cross him. The FBI are also after him, but there also seems to be something good about him.An unusual twist on the action film genre with autism unusually becoming one of the drivers of the plot and character. There is a danger of course of generalising about the condition and something not comfortable about using it as a driver for action and crime. Having said that, this must be the first film to use the condition in this way, even if it is somewhat problematic. Affleck is not altogether convincing in his portrayal of someone with Aspberger's, but suspending any other concerns it's a good fun action film."

" Finally a unique look on Autism
",0.0,0.2937,2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,"I love as diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at 15 years old, and in the 11 years since my diagnosis all the media I've seen surrounding autism has never been pleasant. The stories usually revolve around the family, showing how autism has ruined their lives or made their lives unbearable, dramatic messes. And the autistic person is played as a stereotypical burden on their lives. This film, is a much needed breath of fresh air to the typical autism stories, showing that Ben Affleck's Christian Wolff is not badass in spite of his autism, but because of it.
This film tackles many things that other films surrounding autism have never been able to handle right, if their handled at all. Throughout the film, Christian is shown ""masking"" (basically making his autism traits less obvious for neurotypicals) in such subtle ways that might not be caught on the first viewing, such as his tactic of avoiding eye contact by only looking slightly away instead of up in the air like most portrayals, or his pretending to be joking about not understanding sarcasm (I myself have done that one so many times it's not even funny).
They even handle the controversial style of ABA therapy (thought to be abusive by most autistics), and the positive and negative impacts it may have on a person.
As if making a ""high functioning"" (as NT's would call it) autistic person badass, they also defy a long held stereotype that non-verbal autistics lack the ability to communicate, and even show how badass they can be as well.
This is a film that I needed to see when I got my diagnosis. A film that showed that neurological differences can actually make your life better."

Being able to uncook books is a sure way to have the Treasury Department trying to unwind your ways. Wolff is employed by a tech mogul (John Lithgow), who is wanting to eliminate clients that are secretly manipulating his company's records and trying to destroy his empire. Wolff is slick with rearranging ciphers and bottom lines as well as erasing sharp shooting killers. Plenty of action and Affleck is outstanding in the lead role.

" Forrest Gump is a CPA
",0.0,-0.3182,2020-07-06 00:00:00,3,"When making a movie about an accountant who is boring, has no people skills and has autism you have 3 actors to choose from: Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner and Nicolas Cage. As was said by someone else years ago, those actors can express every emotion from A to B. The movie sucks with a near impossible to follow in real time convoluted plot. The only thing potentially interesting here is the actual character Affleck took money to play who is basically a more educated Forest Gump. The CPA takes incredible risks to accumulate tons of money that he evidently has no use for other than to buy ""collectibles"". Ok. Elsewhere, Anna Kendrick again plays the skinny version of Audrey Hepburn, the guy from the drum movie (Simmons?) looks like he's going to digress to an insurance company commercial at any moment, and John Lithgow opens his eyes W-I-D-E at every line. This movies fails in most every department."
" Superb action thrill ride
",0.765,0.9801,2020-06-28 00:00:00,9,"Well done, Ben Affleck and Co.! I start with Ben because he is so awesome in this movie. It's delightful to see how he's progressed over the years, and how he continues to grow as an actor and filmmaker. This film rests heavily on him, and he carries the weight on his beefy shoulders with ease. The rest of the cast in equally brilliant, with a typical scene stealing performance by JK Simmons. I swear, the man can make any movie his own with as little screen time as possible.
I especially loved the relationship of the father with his sons. Sure, some might think that the dad was too hard on his sons, especially Chris, but that type of upbringing really helped and turned Chris from a potential victim into a champion.
The one thing that didn't work for me - hence 10 stars and not nine - the ending, the confrontation between Affleck and Bernthal. I'm not sure if the fact that Bernthal plays Aflleck's grown brother was supposed to be a surprise or not, but how was Affleck's identity a surprise for Bernthal? How many brilliant accountants with military training are there in the States? Perhaps this will become clearer upon another viewing, which this film clearly deserves."

It apparently tries to have everything in one place - story of a genius, sensitizing for autism, love story, father-son relationship, fierce action scenes, backstory of Ray King (JK Simmons' character), backstory of Dana Cummings (Cynthia AR's character), ins and outs of offshoring and accounting trickery - and falls short in delivery. These storylines have all had the potential and well selected cast to entertain in themselves, but all of them together was just too much for a 2 hr movie. Speaking of casting - Ben Affleck is a one-sided actor, especially for this rather overcomplicated character, for me he was mostly authentic for the coldblooded and professional accountant role."

People with savant syndrome should not be pushed aside by our society at all but rather educate them. teach them, how to live. His father taught him how to live in this mundane. Taught him how to defend, fight to survive. Really thrilling and enjoying."

The problem isn't the action parts, or the acting.
Actually, Ben Affleck, nevertheless, does some interesting and good acting here, playing an (partially treated) autistic accountant..whose role varies during the film, most of the time incomprehensibly (not that this affects the acting).
So unfortunately, the plot has numerous holes, and unbelievable leaps in its screenplay.
Sometimes, it gives you hope that it will get better, but it goes endlessly and totally disappointing."

" The Accountant
",0.0,0.9847,2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"The Accountant is a rare film which have some accounting and also character study.The film overall reprises the unique Gavin O'connor Directorial style and builds on a criminal accountant's life and how it closes.A spiral and a confusing child hood with an amazing highly trained skill set, but lack of social skills Christian Wolff is an amazing character study.But the film gets loaded up with too much depth of unnecessary aspects making it carried away.Anyway this is like a super hero film for accountants.Because Ben Affleck reprises his Role of batman in this film as well. Because he kicks ass in this film.A great take on a very niche character.Personally loved the film due to it's take on accountancy and the character.And I'm an accountant in training so this is basically motivation.
Overall - 3.5/5"

Full of twists are are either too predictable or too corny or both.
But at least the last scene is actually pretty good.Overall, it was alright.

I think that no matter how different we are, we're all trying to do the same thing.""Only a true math savant may be capable of connecting the film's many plot threads in convincing fashion, yet this violent action-thriller still entertains for a jam-packed 128 minutes. Gavin O'Connor's skilled direction, highlighted in several well-choreographed action scenes, barely keeps this runaway train on the rails as he's fighting the screenplay's identity crisis, with two or three better features bursting at its seams. The overall picture, like our protagonist battling sensory overload, is stifled by a lack of focus and stuck in second gear, most evident with one noir-influenced sequence in the third act that could have been left on the cutting room floor, or revived in a rumoured TV series. What keeps audiences engaged and on the edge of their seats is a dedicated and sincere performance from leading man Ben Affleck, the ever-charming Anna Kendrick and a who's who of character actors having a ton of fun (look out for the forever shackled-up Jeffrey Tambor, bringing a certain arrested sitcom to mind)."

Maybe less chatty with Anna, since that wouldn't happen as immediately as it did here. And Anna...girl, wrong role!!! You have to stop this cycle! It's the same role as ""A Simple Favor.""

No music all the time, so boring in SO many movies. Nice image, good photographyThen the movie. I had a poor copy given by a friend and after seeing it I bought the BR straight away. The characters I enjoyed them, the action I enjoyed, fight, guns, killings, we know from the beginning the accountant is not a ""normal"" person, so when he acts I expected a sort of coldish way of punching heads and death gunning.

" The Accountant is A well Deserved 10/10!
",0.3382,0.637,2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"When I watched The Accountant the first couple of times, I originally rated it a 9. Now, after like my 5th watch, I believe this movie deserves a 10.Everything from the storyline to the acting and the scenery is amazing. The movie made me feel happy, sad, worried, mad, enlightened, great full, and joyful. I loved how the creators gave Christian Wolff a disability, it makes him so original. Although his disability comes with challenges, he also used it to his advantage which helped him in both his accounting and hitman careers. Although his disability makes him seem awkward and different, it's so inspirational how it gives him an urgency to accomplish his tasks and focus on whatever he's working on. No drugs, just a very intelligent man.All of the actors and actresses deserving a standing ovation because everyone was so convincing. They gave the audience a chance to dig deeper into their personal lives so we could see a glimpse of how they got to where they were.In a way, it sort of seem Shakespearean. I love how they introduced his brother, Brax. At first, I thought he vanished but when he confronted the stockbroker, he immediately caught my attention. Brax's crew were solid and it showed how powerful he was. The build up to their final fight was incredible. The fight was emotional because you could see in Christian's face that he was wrong for going to his mother's funeral and that he didn't really want to fight his younger brother. But, there was no escaping, he had to fight him.The Accountant was phenomenal and Honestly, I'm going to school for accounting which enhances my viewing because I learned some things from this movie."

",0.0,0.9888,2019-11-03 00:00:00,10,"It amazes me to see people give this film 1 star and call Ben Affleck's performance ""wooden"". That makes it obvious to me that 1. they didn't pay attention to the details of the film, the story 2. they don't understand autism whatsoever.
I have a daughter with autism, which doesn't make me an expert, but at the very least puts me in the category with of a horse in this race. The mannerism and psychological makeup of Affleck's acting is on point. What they consider ""wooden"" is actual Mr. Affleck doing a hell of a job character acting. When some people give this film 1 star and I give it 10 and believe it should have won best picture over Moonlight any day of the week, it give me pause as to how our numbers can be so off. And the only thing I can imagine is personal bias on their part. I could imagine bias on my part, yet I'm giving the film the rating is deserves. But to have a difference of 8 stars there can only be a few possibilities. Mood effects enjoyment and bias against the story and or actors on screen. The story was solid from start to finish. A solid plot with no holes in it. The acting by all the actors was wonderfully executed.
There is no need to go into details about the film as many others have done this for me and I don't feel the need to repeat what's been said. But just know that this film will hold up over time. It's a film I've watched over a dozen times with enjoyment each and every time. Noticing something new with each viewing. And so long as you're willing to be entertained and not bring your own baggage to the viewing, you'll enjoy this film over and over again as well.

" Intelligent thriller
",0.5267,0.986,2019-10-04 00:00:00,9,"Liked this one a lot, a smart movie, makes you think, slowly unfolding characters twists and reveals. I had a couple of oh wow moments.Ben Affleck is very good in this role as an autistic math genius who works as a financial consultant for criminal organizations. No emotion required for this role which I guess works in his favour because I just watched 'Live By Night' and he was terrible in that, showing zero emotion and one facial expression for the entire movie, Anyways I digress.This is an intelligent thriller following Ben as he agrees to help Anna Kendrick, an accounting clerk look into fraud at the company she works at while at the same time being investigated by the treasury department. Way more action than I was expecting, believable action scenes though, lots of bullets flying 'John Wick' style, it works, is explained in a manner I believed, he doesn't just become an action hero for the sake of the movie. Good use of flashbacks there.Big cast, everyone is awesome (J.K Simmons, Jeffrey Tambor, John Lithgow, Jon Bernthal) I liked the relationship with Anna K, liked Anna K very much. Loved the surprises and twists towards the end, the voice on the phone.Appreciated that this story made me think, slowly unfolding and revealing, answering my questions -whatever happened to..? oh of course."

" ANOTHER GREAT AFFLECK PERFORMANCE & A GREAT ACTION THRILLER
",0.8625,0.9986,2019-09-17 00:00:00,7,"Ben Affleck is becoming one of my top favourite actors, well I've always been a big fan since ""Deception aka Reindeer Games"", ""Changing Lanes"" , ""The Sum of all Fears"" ""Daredevil"" & ""PayCheck"" but then he didn't really do anything that good until his ""The Town"" back in 2010, he directed that excellent gritty-urban heist thriller & catapulted him back into the spot light as a great actor & director!!!
I was always a huge fan of ""Daredevil"" it's still one of the greatest super hero films in my opinion it's an underrated cult classic.
Anyway Affleck has become a huge star again with excellent movies such as ""Argo"",""Gone Girl"" , ""Triple Frontier"" ""Batman vs Superman"" ""Justice league"" & this ""The Accountant"", he was fantastic as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the underrated ""Batman vs Superman"" & gave us the best version of batman ever put in screen, his Dark knight was really dark, gritty & tough as hell, exactly how he should be just like the gritty graphic novels & exactly how a ""real"" Batman would be, so Affleck really has grown as an incredible actor & director!!!
He gets alot of unnecessary hate but i think he's a million times better than the likes of ""Tom Cult Cruise"" or boring ""Brad Pitt"" so that bit was about how good Affleck actually is.The Accountant is an Action-Thriller that stars slow but builds up nicely until it explodes with bullets & blood, similar too ""The Equaliser"" or ""John Wick"" or even ""Taken"" in some ways, as we have a pretty ordinary guy or what's seems ordinary but is abit of a genius & highly trained killing machine but Affleck here as mr.Wolf has a form of Autism that makes his character much more complex & interesting as he appears emotionless & zoned out but he's a genius at maths & accounting!!!
This is a smart, stylish & thrilling action Thriller with a standout performance by Affleck, also the rest of the excellent cast are all great especially ""John Bernthal"" as Brax, he gives an intense performance.Just watch this Thriller unfold & don't find out too much about it, just watch it & enjoy a solid, well acted Thriller"

Affleck plays this autistic Rambo math wiz who uses his non-descript accountant business as a cover for his true job. Yet he is able to land an accounting gig for a significant robotics company and he finds some interesting things while running the numbers....as only his special math-tuned mind can. The more he uncovers the more shady people enter the scene requiring him to also utilize his 'convenient' childhood military training. For an action movie, there is ample bloodshed but not much tension. The plot was moderately intricate and engaging enough. Something to pop in as you peruse the evening sports scores."

The characters development is amazing! It's hard not to feel for both the good guys and the bad (although sometimes it's hard to know who's who). The pace is good and there are a lot of moral questions involved. I loved how it gives you a whole new way to look at what's ""different"". At how we see, feel and measure those who are different from us. It's a great thriller, it might not be perfect but it sure is close! Highly recommended!"

Good production - where even the night-time scenes are perfectly lighted, for a change. Sound was remarkable.Not usually a fan of Anna Kendrick, I was very surprised in my first viewing that I really enjoyed her performance. Kudos to the script writer/s for not falling into the rut that I expected with Kendrick and Affleck.

Christian Wolff is freaking human, and that's a big plus for an action thriller. The device of autism is quite crude, but in my opinion it worked very well in giving him humanity. Also about humanity, the five main relationships between Wolff and other characters (father, Anna Kendrick, villain, JK Rowling, girl on the phone) are all given time and depth, sometimes reaching the point of moving the audience. I can't remember an action movie giving (or attempting) so much depth in such a short time. Lastly, I liked the ending very much. I recommend this to anybody who likes this genre. You will be surprised."
" Well worth watching

The only change I would have made , were I the one casting it, would be to have a different actress other than Anna Kendrick. I find her character depth to be shallow and she is without substance in her performance."
" Actually a very good hidden gem that cruised under the radar.
",0.4927,0.7064,2019-04-05 00:00:00,8,"This movie did not receive much publicity when first released, but is actually one of the more effective Ben Affleck movies. The thing that is most fascinating is Ben's portrayal of his character, which I found ironic: most people consider him kind of a dopey, less than intelligent actor, and I think that he unwittingly plays on this perception in a smart way, by playing someone with some mental deficits who nonetheless is very highly functional. He is an accountant who conducts shady business for some very bad people (ie drug dealer clients, assassins, organized crime, etc.). This means that he himself is a sometime-assassin in his own right, and has military training, due to his father's strict upbringing. There is a third wheel, a Fed who is trying to unravel this man's misdeeds. Unknown to him until the end, his own brother, also in the same lifestyle, is actually his main antagonist for most of the movie. He, with the help of a cute secretary, who plays nothing but a tease, uncovers a double-cross in the current firm that he is working at and attempt to undo the conspiracy, which involved killing the secretary and him in the cover-up."
" Acting quality and directing quality vs. concept/source material
",0.0,0.9513,2019-03-16 00:00:00,7,"An adequate acting performance manages to avoid detracting from the quality of the character it portrays. A good acting performance enhances it. In ""The Accountant"", there is only one good acting performance of note, by Anna Kendrick. She is extremely sympathetic and relatable in a very limited role. J.K. Simmons, among others, makes a valiant attempt to elevate characters from irretrievably poor material that doom them to be mediocre at best. Cynthia Addai-Robinson gives a poor performance, adding vagueness and inaccuracy to a character that would have been far more vivid if we just exclusively read the screenplay. There is one adequate acting performance of note, Ben Affleck. Unlike the movie ""Argo"", where he detracts from his character, his performance in ""The Accountant"" is perfectly serviceable.
The film unfolds in a number of different story arcs, each of which could easily be an entire film unto themselves. This plentiful material would be a boon, but only one of the story arcs, the one that directly follows the main character with his personal history and relationships and choices, is well executed. For the rest, we are left to soak up massive amounts of plot and character exposition in short scenes near the end of the movie. Again, we would do almost as well reading this material in screenplay form as by watching it in the movie. Worse than that, the movie includes far insufficient material to begin to make sense of or sympathize with these massive and complex plot developments, leaving the viewer with a lot of incoherence. A common misconception of art analysis will surface here. Some audience members will argue that they can fill in the blanks with their imagination and come up with excellent results. But if you the viewer are forced to essentially write material yourself that is vital to the quality of the movie (unlike, for example, the audience imagining gratuitous exposition to add to an already great movie), then that is a credit to your imagination but an indictment of the actual movie's quality.
For the quality of the main story arc and of Kendrick's and Affleck's characters, I give this movie a 6.5."
" A twist on the thriller genre
",0.1027,0.9322,2019-03-10 00:00:00,7,"THE ACCOUNTANT offers a fresh twist on the action thriller genre for a film which is just as much a character study and drama as it is an action flick. In fact, those looking for Bourne-style hijinks are likely to be disappointed; there's an intense bit in the middle and a solid climax, but otherwise this is about actors doing what they do. Ben Affleck gets a chance to play a very interesting character, an austistic protagonist (how often do you see this?) who gets involved in a financial plot depicted in an interesting way. The film is generally quite gripping and involving, although it's a little slow and talky in parts and certain aspects are badly handled (Anna Kendrick's character has no purpose being in the film, really). Overall, I enjoyed it."
" Fine Way to Spend a Couple Hours
",0.2023,0.8689,2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,Predictable. Fun. An enjoyable way to spend a couple hours. Affleck does a nice job with the lead character...better than I would have expected with the half accountant/half-Rambo personality.Go ahead and watch it; it's a fine way to burn a couple hours.
" A satisfying twist to the action-spy genre.
",0.4588,0.9872,2019-03-08 00:00:00,9,"When this movie came out a few years ago, I missed watching it because it seemed like just another generic action-spy film. Sure, the main character might be smart, leading to his professional ""skills"" (in more than one realm), but the trailers never really hinted at the reason for this attention to detail. Having now seen it, The Accountant takes an interesting approach to the action-spy genre while also including a number of twists that were as satisfying to figure out ahead of time as they were to see revealed on the screen.I will say that the plot of The Accountant was sometimes confusing, but only because I felt like they glossed over some plot holes and leaps in logic. Even if I was asking myself, ""Hey, what about . . . ?"" I didn't have much time to dwell on it. The somewhat frenetic pacing of the movie helped to push the plot forward to some well-done revelations that had just enough foreshadowing to be fulfilling. I also wasn't completely sold that the Treasury Department was functioning more like the CIA in regards to this federal manhunt. Either way, the strength of the rest of the film helped to gloss over these rough bits.The highlight of The Accountant, I think, is the main character, portrayed by Ben Affleck. In a world that's trending ever forward toward full inclusion, this character's particular condition could undoubtedly lend itself to the attentiveness needed for accounting, as well as fast-paced action sequences. I do worry that the representation of this condition might be more along the lines of the stereotypes usually associated with it, but I think it also shows that such a condition can be lived with and used as an advantage. At the very least, it lent itself to a few hilarious moments as the main character didn't necessarily know how to deal with the people around him.A satisfying twist to the action-spy genre, I give The Accountant 4.5 stars out of 5."

Some plot twists in the end of the movie felt unnecessary and gave a feeling of making twists just for the fun of it and not to make a wholesome movie.

Jon Bernthal was quite good, J.K. Simmons was once again terrific after I'm seeing his acting in Whiplash,
Anna Kendrick was felt doing something new for her and she was fine with performance, John Lithgow and Other Actors (I Don't Know They're Names) was really supported the film with there acting.Problem of this movie is slow pace which people may not connect with it and story telling is way more unconventional that audience may feel lost...Still I prefer it for brilliant acting, direction and technical support of the film..

" OK but you've see it all before
",0.2421,0.8923,2019-02-14 00:00:00,7,"'Christian Wolff' (Ben Affleck) is yet another √ºber-efficient killer, this time the gimmick is that he is a high-functioning autistic with an aptitude for math (and assassinations), who does forensic accounting for crime lords, cartels, rogue-states, etc. The premise is a bit of a stretch and the film relies of a lot of coincidences, especially in the last reel (the 'twist ending' is contrived and ludicrous). Affleck is fine playing Hollywood's idea of an autistic-savant and the rest of the cast serviceable in their 2D-action movie roles. There is lots of reasonably well-done carnage as various evil minions are mowed down, but in the end it all starts to look the same. Wolff is refreshingly cold-blooded but his nemesis, played Jon Bernthal, is pretty bland. There are a couple of unnecessary subplots involving: 1) a young women (Anna Kendrick) Wolff finds himself protecting, and 2) a guilt-laden Treasury Agent (J. K. Simmons) and his mentee-with-a-back-story (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), both of which slow down the film. If you like the 'unstoppable killing-machine' genre, you'll probably like 'The Accountant', just don't except anything novel, edgy, or clever."
" Surprisingly good
",0.6249,0.8236,2019-02-08 00:00:00,8,"Whilst some elements of this story are far fetched such as the skills displayed by Afleck, the acting was of a good standard and I was particularly impressed by Afleck's acting of an adult with Autism. A decent movie that I wouldn't discourage anyone from watching."
" Solid action and some good twists
",0.5423,0.9479,2019-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Christian Wolff is an autistic savant with a skill for numbers. His clients are among the most disreputable criminals and now he is in the sights of Ray King, the director of Treasury Department's the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Looking for a more reputable client Wolff takes a job investigating an accounts discrepancy at a robotics company. He quickly finds that there is indeed a problem but his contract is terminated after the 'suicide' of the company's Chief Financial Officer. Soon both he and Dana Cummings, the company accountant who first suspected something was wrong, are targeted by killers. They hadn't banked on a mere accountant being proficient in martial arts and a crack shot... it isn't long before they are the hunted.This is a solid action thriller with some interesting characters. Ben Affleck does a fine job as Wolff making us believe that this is a man who can both solve complex mathematical problems and dispatched trained killers with ease. Anna Kendrick was solid as Dana; it was refreshing to have a film like this where there is no romance between the leading man and leading woman. The rest of the cast are good too; notably J. K. Simmons as Director King, Cynthia Addai-Robinson as analyst Marybeth Medina and John Lithgow who runs the company Wolff investigates. The use of flashbacks to show Wolff's childhood, and how he came to possess his skills were entertaining and made the character more believable. There are plenty of action scenes; these are all well handled with a dynamism that keeps things exciting. The final twist was perhaps a little too far-fetched but it didn't reduce my enjoyment of the film. Overall well worth watching if you enjoy action films with a decent plot."

" A new breed of hero (that isn't a duck)
",0.5574,0.9957,2019-01-30 00:00:00,7,"As much a Ben Affleck has come in for criticism over the years, it's fair to say that, given the right script (and/or the right part or director), he is actually capable of being more than just a passable leading man (even despite what that song said about him in 'Team America: World Police!'). Therefore, it's no surprise that he'd want to keep the momentum of his acting ability rolling by taking roles that may require a little more than just showing up and looking good.We've seen plenty of films about hitmen and plenty of those involve a - practically indestructible - leading man taking on scores of faceless bad guys with precision accuracy and never so much as getting a scratch. 'The Accountant' could quite easily slip into this kind of genre. However, what sets it apart is that our protagonist (Affleck) is both a hitman, due to his overbearing father taking extreme measures at getting him to 'toughen up' and ensure he doesn't spend the rest of his life getting picked on or taken advantage and also an accountant. If you're wondering why those two professions somehow work so well, it's because Affleck plays an autistic hitman/accountant who's therefore not just a bit socially awkward, but also amazing with figures on balance sheets and killing people with sniper rifles.And, our heroic pen-pusher gets tangled up in a job that involves both his professions when he audits some shady company's books and gets more than he bargained for when the company's director (played by the seemingly ever-evil John Lithgow) decides to 'fire' their new accountant (in more ways than one!).There's definitely plenty of like about 'The Accountant.' It's not just the run-of-the-mill action/hitman story that it could have been, as the whole 'autism' element does add an extra layer as to why Affleck's character is like he is. However, an accountant-hitman's life is never easy and a fellow hitman (Jon Bernthal) is hot on his case. I've been a big fan of Jon Bernthal since 'The Walking Dead' and he really does seem to be having a lot of fun in this role and it's a pity he's not in it more than he is. Instead, much of the plot isn't taken up with the Affleck vs Bernthal, but with the 'love interest' for Affleck played by Anna Kendrick. I have nothing against her as she's a perfectly capable actress, however it just seemed that this element of the film really was crowbarred in, just to add a love story into something that didn't really need it.Overall, 'The Accountant' is certainly different enough to be worth a watch if you're a fan of Affleck or the genre itself. However, whereas the premise is slightly original, the execution does contain the usual clich√©s you'd expect with a film like this."

Sweet.Don't know if the characters Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick playing Anna Kendrick) or Marybeth Medina (Ms. random FBI agent nobody) were required, or if the universal plot was even fully there-let alone stable-in the first place, but the underground lore of what The Accountant envisions keeps it adequate enough. I think this premise and this eye-openingly intriguing character known as, Christian Wolff, has more potential in a more feasible, transformative sequel-maybe even franchise (if they don't gazump up that sequel I'm crossing my fingers for!!!). That aside, this singular on its own thrives as each act progressively becomes more tempting than the last, building and building until it roars off with an uncommonly quick, yet, white-knuckled finale that hatches sternly unpresentented results.Once again, I must reiterate. Let's have ourselves a sequel to The Accountant (and a formidable one at that). Please. (Verdict: B-)"
" A New Twist on the Action Thriller
",0.1027,0.9343,2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,"15 January 2017. Take a high functioning Autistic adult, a brutal and demanding father who requires such a son to be able to take care of himself, and using a familiar action thriller plot and you have The Accountant. While the potential of such a movie might have been pretty manipulative, exploitative, and mildly stupid, somehow the director, Ben Affleck, and the screenwriter put together a consistently, well executed action thriller with a new take on a Bourne Identity profile.With echoes from Keanu Reeve's Constantine and Matt Damon's Bourne proficiency in getting the job done, Ben Affleck gets to handle himself in a similar, but distinctly different style that is as riveting as Keanu and Matt. There are actually two story lines, possible even an emergent third storyline that are intertwined all in a mysterious cloak of investigative convolutions that begin to be unraveled in a delicious unclocking among the fascination of Ben Affleck's autistic performance.This is an entertaining and illuminating experience of both action and revealing psychological unveiling of the mental human differences."

I cannot praise this film enough, it has everything you want; Superbly written layered characters that grow and evolve throughout the film, a strong, gripping, tense and highly entertaining storyline, highest quality acting and a thourougly satisfying ending.Coming off 'The Town' I didn't think I'd see Ben play such a deep emotionally damaged but tough as nails character for a long time but this film truly brings out the best in Afflecks acting abilities.Unlike the Muhammed Ali jigsaw puzzle this film takes its time to lay out all the pieces on the board, never missing a step in turning up the heat at just the right moments to keep you wanting more. It's like all the best moments from Taken, The Equalizer and John Wick rolled into one masterpiece of a film.The hurt you feel for Christian Wolff and what he's had to endure makes you understand exactly why he lives the life he does. He's a survivor and a man seeking justice at all costs and damn does he deliver justice to the guilty.What I loved was the characters never felt too over the top, they always felt real and true to who they were, which is difficult to do with people like Wolffs brother Brax and Anna Kendricks Dana but they were written perfectly and slotted into the story in just the right way to help Wolff grow and understand more about life outside his bubble.He battled with his condition and succeeded and can solve even the most complex maths equations but you don't need to times 298,567 by 92 to realise this film is a masterpiece.10/10."

" Convoluted and confusing mess, but it does entertain
",0.1901,0.9916,2018-12-30 00:00:00,6,"Here's the puzzle: what's it all about? What just happened? The Accountant succeeds in that it entertains, holds your attention and intrigues. It behaves as if it is making a significant point, but doesn't get around to making it. OK, if the point is that those with autism are no lesser mortals than those of use who aren't autistic, all cheer to that, but forgive me if that isn't a rather trite point to build a film around.As for that film, being intriguing shouldn't mean being confusing. I can settle for not being spoon-fed - in fact, I rather like it when I'm not - but there is an obligation on a filmmaker (or writer) to supply all the bits from which we the viewer (or reader) can piece together what we are intended to piece together. The Accountant doesn't do that. Worse, it pulls that rather sneaky trick of pretending to be more than it is.Convoluted doesn't begin to describe The Accountant, and that it doesn't end up being something of a mess is probably more luck than judgement. The questions mount up but are not just not answered, but are given a spurious significance. Why is it important, or rather how is it relevant that the junior Treasury analyst should have a criminal past she never disclosed and which fact her Treasury boss uses to coerce her into a covert investigation? Why does that investigation have to be covert? We are given a confusing scene in which the boss 'explains' what motivates him, but blow me if I understood. Perhaps I'm just a little bit thick. Or perhaps I'm not and the film is cheating.Who is the British women who organises the accountants work? How come she is somehow omnipotent? Who is the accountant's brother and what is his line of work? And on and on. Yes, it is good to be intrigued but there must be a pay-off line of some kind.Irritatingly, these huge flaws are to a certain extent offset by the film being very entertaining (these even a long gunfight in the dark in which our hero takes out about a dozen heavily armed men).

J K Simmons is always good (OZ), and this role is no exception. Affleck is fine in the lead role, and I don't think Mel Gibson would have been better (he likes the three stooges too much). However, he would have been funnier than Affleck with the Coen Brothers directing. This film cried for some satire, but only got crumbs in that area. Everyone in the film plays their roles straight; and, of course, that could never happen in a Coen film.

",0.0,0.9415,2018-12-05 00:00:00,10,"I love a good movie, especially one with a good story. I am not relegated to a particular
genre, but I tend to lean more towards action/suspense. Nothing better than being
sucked into a different world and keeping you wondering, what is going to happen next. The
movie; The Accountant, does not disappoint! Written by Bill Dobuque, directed by Gavin
O'Connor and starring Ben Affleck as Christian Wolf, Anna Kenndrick as Dana Cummings, Jk
Simmons as Raymond King, Jon Bernthal as Braxton, Cynthia Addai-R.obinson as Marybeth
Medina, Jeffrey Tambor as Francis, and John Lithgow as Lamar Blackburn. I personally enjoyed
the story line of The Accountant, it takes you on a journey of two young boys raised by a single
military father who's mother leaves when the father refuses help for their autistic son, simply
stating ""He doesn't need a sensory environment safe place, he needs to learn to adapt and function
as the real world is not sensory environmentally safe"", Christians Father. Christian and Braxton
grow up with a variety of special training, which is told in a series of strategically placed flash
backs woven into the story line to bring it all together. Leading two completely different lives
Christian Wolf (Ben Affleck) becomes a forensic accountant usually hired to find financial
deceptions and embezzlement for criminal organizations. While Braxton (Jon Bernthal) becomes
a gun for hire.
I was somewhat skeptical when the trailers were first released about ""The Accountant"", but
it did not disappoint. There is sufficient character development and the story has a good amount
of twists and turns. There are several intersecting story lines in this film and one branch of that is
the federal department tracking The Accountant. There is ample amount of action, both gun firing
and hand to hand combat. The headshots are brutal, the body count is high. Every question raised
in this movie was answered by its conclusion. It was so entertaining and creative. the movie ended
well leaving room for a much needed sequel. But it is not your typical action like John wick or
The Equalizer. The movie is engaging and entertaining. The suspense and tension was maintained
throughout. The slow moving scenes are carefully crafted with the right sound, camera, and flash
backs designed to help us feel how deliberate both Christian's need for routine and isolation are.
Director O'Connor succeeded in normalizing autism and showing that behavioral conditions
should not get in the way of anyone's life. For those of you that are not a big fan of Ben Affleck as
an actor, I can say that, that does not take away from the story at all, in fact the movie cast him
perfectly with his wooden, emotionless, intellectual yet tough look. Ben nailed the behavior and
mannerisms of someone with high-functioning autism.
The turning point for the movie; Christian took on an accounting job for Living Robotics,
when the accountant Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) finds an embezzlement of 61 million-
dollars within the company, Christian is hired to audit the company by the owner Lamar
Blackburn (John Lithgow) and his sister Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart). During the night, Chilton
the financial director of Living Robotics is murdered as if he had committed suicide and Lamar
finishes the audit affecting Christian since he has not completed his job to his satisfaction. Rattled
by this, Christian heads out to a farm where he is goes to shoot his guns. In the middle of a flash
back of his childhood, two guns for hire show up and take the older farm couple hostage. In the
process of the farmer's wife (gun to her head) is trying to call Christian back to the house, bad guy
one's head explodes causing bad guy two to take the couple around back and try to escape in the
old farm truck. Christian shoots the radiator and proceeds to engage bad guy two in a hand to knife
combat. Right before Christian kills bad guy number two, he learns that more men where hired to
go after the other accountant, Dana Cummings (Anna Kenndrick). Christian's moral code has been
broken so he continues to search and take out the people involved.
The Accountant proceeds to add on more intrigue as the movie progresses. Though
relatively predictable there are a few twist and surprises right up to the end. I really enjoyed how
the last scene ties back into the beginning of the movie. It is a movie that will leave you with just
enough questions to make you want to go back and watch it again."
" Not Impressed
",-0.3724,-0.6854,2018-12-04 00:00:00,5,"This came as highly recommended. IMDb score is more than 7. But sadly the movie fails. It fails to portray the story in a believable way.
It is as though a three minute idea has been made into a movie. And the makers were taking no chances. They threw in Asperger syndrome, mathematical genius, expert in Indonesian Martial Arts, military training, expert in weapons and a sniper shooting accuracy of an elite, a father and son relationship, a half cooked love story, a story of two brothers, a story of friendship, a company duping millions of money. Phew!
I rest my case."

" Entertaining and occasionally boring
",0.2247,-0.7964,2018-11-25 00:00:00,8,"In the intro we meet a family with an autistic son. The father refuses to have him checked in to some specialized center. It takes a toll on the mother who leaves her two children with the father.Then we meet the autist, Chris, as an adult. He's high-functioning but lacks all emotions. He's an accountant who gets his assignments from a woman calling him on an encrypted phone and with a scrambled voice. His new job is discovering some missing money from the books of a big robotics/prosthetics company. There he quickly discovers what happened and meets some girl who works there. Elsewhere some hitman goes after an accountant in Switzerland. And the Treasury Department is after Chris. They know him is the accountant of drug cartels and terrorists. But he also was involved in a mafia massacre.Suddenly the hitmen now are after him (and the company girl) and that reveals Chris to be Rambo as well. In flashbacks we learn that the father was military and instead of isolating the son got him and the brother trained in martial arts, forced them to attack street gangs and so on. Chris realizes that there something crooked going on at the robotics company and decides to go after the company big shots just as the hitmen army waits from him. In the meantime, Treasure discovers his identity and something is revealed about the guy running the investigation. There's also a surprise awaiting Chris as he meets his nemesis.The Accountant has a pretty good concept and does a good job combining brains and brawl. But it also wants to do too much. The nearly-romance is unnecessary. The action though is pretty brutal and entertaining. But it takes a while to get there and we spend an awful lot of time with Chris in his youth, which can be unpleasant--watching mental/neurological illness in a movie always is. He also does some stint in jail where he first meets a mafia accountant. The story ties up all loose ends and then some. No coincidence is too absurd. While most movies don't bother telling us much about their characters, this one gives us a background about every character. Near the end one we learn in yet more flashbacks everything about the Treasury guy and how Chris came to his attention. Chris also gets a full profile; we witness his too lives, the overt one and his secret life. He's into art, has some terrible routines to deal with his condition. The ending draws out forever as there are more and more revelations. At more then two hours this movie is too long and would have benefited from a tighter editing."

" Movie Truly Accounts For Greatness
",0.4404,0.6939,2018-10-09 00:00:00,9,"I actually thought this movie was directed by Ben Affleck, but it wasn't. It feels like it is. Nonetheless, this is a refreshing and original film, and bloody exciting too, in not the clearest of story, although we get the gist of it, but this only makes it more enthralling. Affleck, great as a Maths wiz, with a slight form of autism, and a big case of OCD, one would say, plays a closeted accountant who cooks books, some for quite dangerous organizations. In the earlier part of the film, we can't really ascertain if he's good or bad, which makes for a curious as hell, engaged audience. I really liked Affleck's performance, and I know quite a bit about OCD myself, especially where we see in flashbacks, how Affleck's child character has to solve puzzles or equations, or go ballistic or nuts in the process. I myself suffered a four month hell, involving number sequences, scrawling them on paper, then fishing them out of a bin hours later. The rest of the cast deliver, but it's Affleck, who has our main focus. There's one hell of a backstory behind The Accountant, which too, has the right doses of action, and a twist, but for better purposes, which I really, really liked, as well as watching Affleck, avidly, obsessively, obsessively, avidly turn four glass windows of a room, into four full ones of deconstructed mathematical equations- prices, which makes Will Hunting look small fry. Everything about The Accountant, makes for a so refreshing new film, superior to other thrillers lurking about.I wish to hell, Affleck had directed this in it's natural state, and believe me, you don't want to tamper for the perfection of this film. A must see."
" I liked it
",0.4215,0.9878,2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"I liked the movie but had some strange stuff in it where they tried to do a movie checklist I guess. 3 things I'll point out. 1. You can't make accounting ""fun"", there's a part where he's looking at the books for the last 15 years of a huge company and you know they try to ""eye of the tiger"" the scene, making numbers look fun with up beat music and such. C'mon be realistic... We all know accounting isn't fun, you can't fool the audience when it comes to that, that scene could have been better handled and still make the guy look like he's amazing at his job.2. The female love interest was handled very poorly. Made women look desperate and needy, willing to change their views on stuff to align with the males view. She can clearly see something is wrong with the guy but continues to put herself down to impress him even tho she can tell he's no good for her. It was just a really weak portrayal of the female psyche. 3. Last scene that bugged me is that at the end they tried to do a ""The moral of the story"" scene where an autistic woman is a pen-pal to the lead character. The scene is trying to say if you have an autistic child, that they can still lead a semi-normal life but the scene has a child wondering in to a room in a house of autistic children and there is an older woman there laying on a bed (I guess her and the main character remained friends from a 2 minute scene from when they were children shot earlier in the movie) and when the boy enters the room the woman goes in to a fit, the parents walk in and are disturbed by what's happening and then the ""doctor"" walks in and says it's ok, she communicates by machine and then cuts back to the autistic woman typing on a computer, writing to the main character. It was just a stupid and totally unnecessary scene that made zero sense. ""Your child can live a normal life"" and their example is a woman who lives in a ""nursing home"" that lays in bed all day, goes in to fits whenever she is in contact with anyone but have no fear, she can correspond with a sociopath on a computer, whoop-de-doo dum dum dum.Again, I liked the movie but it seemed like there were 2 different creative styles going in to it and it didn't blend well together."
" Cracker movie a must watch

" The Accountant
",0.0,0.992,2018-10-08 00:00:00,5,"The first forty minutes or so of ""the Accountant"" are interesting. As someone on the autism spectrum, I can say that Ben Affleck does a competent job at depicting Chris, an accountant who is capable of great feats of financial wizardry and yet is socially inept due to his autism. Moreover, the set up with Chris working for some of the most evil people on the planet (after all, even villains need superb accounting services ) is amusing. Yet the movie does not work because of one fatal mistake: the filmmakers decided to make Chris into an action star and put him in a generic action picture. What I would have liked is a movie about how someone with highly functioning autism could navigate the real world, create networks, and maintain highly lucrative working relationships with drug cartels, terrorists, and other truly dangerous characters. He could succeed in this world not through violence, but by using his brilliant gifts and tendency to be loyal to gain the respect even of his most unsavory clients. A plot like that could have plenty of funny and witty dialogue and hilarious scenes which make the most of contrasting an autistic person with the personalities of hardened criminals.Yet any possibility of doing something truly creative with this material was thrown away in favor of a purely formulaic plot. What a shame! The only scenes I liked were between Chris and Dana (Anna Kendrick), but sadly they get little screen time together and the action scenes take over. Then the filmmakers appear to cynically hedge their bets by showing a home for autistic children in order to reassure us that ""The Accountant"" is not an action picture really; but instead is delivering a heartfelt message that autistic people are unique human beings. This message comes across as phony because it is so incongruous with the rest of the movie. In short, ""The Accountant"" had interesting possibilities, but it sadly did not make the most of any of them."
" Interesting thriller
",0.4767,0.6249,2018-10-07 00:00:00,7,The Accountant is a unique work with a special message to the autism affected individuals. It helps the audience also to understand their problems.

I watched it on Netflix.

" A Dangerous Accountant
",-0.4767,-0.6794,2018-09-03 00:00:00,8,"Diagnosed with a form of autism as a child, ""Christian Wolff"" (Ben Affleck) has acquired a mastery of accounting that few people in the world can even imagine. To that end, he amasses a fortune helping criminal organizations handle bookkeeping problems. Prior to that, however, he was locked up in prison during an altercation at the wedding ceremony of his estranged mother. It's there that he meets ""Francis Silverberg"" (Jeffrey Tambor) who becomes his only friend in the world. Unfortunately, upon his subsequent release from prison, Francis is killed by members of the Gambino Family in retaliation for turning state's evidence. This infuriates Christian who takes revenge upon everyone involved and then vanishes into thin air. After assuming another identity he then opens up an accounting office in a strip mall and when word gets around about his unique talents he is hired by a large corporation to track down a large sum of money which has apparently been embezzled. However, the closer he gets to identifying the thief the more dangerous it becomes for him and the firm's accountant ""Dana Cummings"" (Anna Kendrick). What nobody fully understands, however, is that Christian is much more dangerous than any hitman alive and because of his condition operates with absolutely no emotion or regret. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie due to the outstanding plot and the acting of Ben Affleck who performed in an excellent manner. Likewise, the surprise ending was equally superb as well. That said, I wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who might be interested and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average."

Worth a watch to kill some time and watch a less unbearable Ben Affleck."
" A hidden gem?
",0.0,0.9961,2018-07-13 00:00:00,8,"I completely wrote this film off when it came out in theaters 2 years ago, maybe it was the title, not exactly the most enticing of occupations, I don't even remember watching a trailer, and I never heard anyone talk about it or hearing much fanfare, so just assumed it was something Affleck was contractually obliged to do by WB while bulking up for Batman and churn something out in the interim. So I ignored it.Cut to today where I'm kind of on some serious downtime coupled with a 4K iTunes binge slash addiction, and catching up on those films I missed out on. I read the reviews and they were extremely positive, I'm a fan of Affleck in general, he's simply a likeable lead even when he's miscast or not quite hitting it, he's just watchable. I used to dislike Anna Kendrick, but became a total convert after Pitch Perfect. And who doesn't love JK Simmons? Seemed like giving the film a shot was a no brainer.The film has some rough edges, and at times it balances that line of feeling smarter than it really is, and I'm sure there are some plot holes that may appear on a repeated view, but I wouldn't know or care right now because I was completely caught up in the film and enjoyed it immensely. It may not have the immediacy of 'Taken', but in terms of being that smart action thriller you don't expect, I would liken it to that. The 3rd act and climax is really great, the film, the subplots and the lead character in general completely begin to gel in a very satisfactory way. I really enjoyed the film. I'd compare it to 'John Wick', less over the top, but it has a similar tone and feel in regards to a stoic lead, excellent action choreography, a considered sense of humor and likeable characters. if you liked those films you will definitely get a kick out of 'The Accountant'. A solid script, solid performances, solid everything. A truly solid 8/10."

He plays the role of a mathematician with autism significantly well, and the supporting cast holds the weight of his performance. 
The story is unique and surprisingly sentimental. The back story laid perfectly. If you watch carefully, the 'twist' isn't much of twist, but it's none the less a wonderful watch. Highly recommend it."

All actors play extremely good and I tried to see one more time some other movies like Jack Reacher (2012) but it bored me to death.

Simmons, Anna Kendrick, and John Lithgow. Just some of the great actors in this gem.Mention that a movie has any one of those names and I will be interested in watching it. Put them all in the same movie and I will have no hesitation in watching it. In this case multiple times on repeat it is so good.The one thing that gives me goosebumps every time I even think about this movie is the sense of honour the main character has, he will do anything for those he loves or he thinks deserves his protection. 
In my opinion this is all down to his father and the way he was brought up. Real genuine friends are hard to find and when you do find one you do everything to protect them.The chemistry between Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick is as clear as day and that was another thing that makes this movie so good for me.This is a must watch movie, I highly recommend it.10/10"
" Messy
",-0.3612,0.9802,2018-06-02 00:00:00,5,"'The Accountant' may have a great acting ensemble and entertaining action sequences, but the messy and disjointed plot confines this movie to being just good. The definite highlight of this film is the acting, which is superbly done by every leading cast member. Ben Affleck portrays his complex character well and is supported by stand out performances from J.K. Simmons and Anna Kendrick. The action sequences, as infrequent as they are, are well choreographed and entertaining to watch but ultimately stand out from the rest of the film. The themes of finance, autism, crime and borderline-romance do not mix well in this film, and these one-too-many tropes cause it to be quite disjointed. The results in the film being rather difficult to enjoy, as you're never quite sure what genre you're really watching. This film would be far more interesting to watch, had I been the type of individual to be intrigued by accounting and financial crime-solving. However, this was all saved from being a bore of a movie by the great acting and engaging action scenes."

He starts working to unravel false accounting at a prosthetics/electronics firm just as the FBI start to intensify looking for the mysterious Accountant who works under the aliases of various mathematicians.This film is a bit difficult to classify. It has a bit of action, some mystery and suspense, and even a touch of comedy. It is a thriller and a character study. If you're an accountant (koff koff), there's even a bit of accountancy in there for you to slaver over. And you often don't know where it's going while it shows you multiple story threads until, towards the end, they begin to come together.But the journey through this mystifying confusion of seemingly disparate narrative strands is never less than entertaining, for a number of reasons. And the main one of these is Ben Affleck's performance as Christian. We see him initially as a child, full of OCD, with a rift between him and the rest of society, and an inability to cope with things like a task left incomplete. Only his brother is able to calm him at such times. Meeting him as an adult, he has clearly developed strategies which enable him to cope in society, but he still remains seemingly emotionless, able to imitate some element of emotional connection but not really experiencing it. Affleck, who seemed to lose his way as an actor, has found it again here: he is first-rate, and an Oscar nomination looks likely (Oscar does seem to like characters with handicaps). The rest of the cast is also excellent.The action and direction are very good and the story is immensely satisfying, albeit you are left with unanswered questions (who is the mysterious woman on the other end of the phone, an intermittent dea ex machina?) and, perhaps, an idea that not everything makes as much sense as it ought to.Nonetheless, this film merits strong recommendation."

I love this movie and I agree with all the good reviews it got. The negative reviews I can't believe. My ex-husband was a CPA and while we were married all those guys would have loved this movie. He would have too but he passed away in 2015 so he didn't get to see it. One way I Judge a movie is how many times I'll watch it on cable. Whenever this is on I watch it! It's far better than most of the stuff that's on. The first time I saw it I was so impressed with it that I wished I had seen it at a theater. 
I enjoyed reading all the trivia notes about this on IMBD and it looks like they really researched everything intolved in it. All the actors did a great job too especially JK Simmons and the girl who played Dana. ( I'm a senior citizen and can't remember her name right now and if I turn back to the page I'll lose this review!). Really everyone was terrific including the boys who played young Chris and Braxton. I wonder if there will be an upswing in autistic boys getting training in martial arts!"

Though Ben Affleck's acting has much improved since the ""Saving Christmas"" days, this movie was a reminder of just how ordinary of an actor he is (not that he had anything to work with). One moment he is not making eye contact, the next he is excitably talking about what he found out with an audit as if he and Kendrick's characters are besties.I can't imagine how they talked J.K. Simmons and John Lithgow into being in this movie. J.K. Simmons seemed bored and embarassed to be in it, and Lithgow had a look of surprise in every scene as if he was realizing just how bad the movie was going to be.Like most Hollweird movies nowadays, the whole thing is just a poor mishmash of bits and pieces taken from other movies, then thrown into a pile.Lamest scene? Probably when his character says matter of factly he doesn't eat donuts, but then is later seen making breakfast with pancakes. Isn't a donut and a pancake the exact same thing except with a hole in the middle of it? They're both made out of flour, sugar, and water. Kind of like this movie is made with similar ingredients as a lot of other movies that came before, but without bringing anything new.Someone very gullible with poor taste would love it, but for the more diserning moviegoer there is nothing new here to see."

The attempt at a romantic interest is non-existent, in fact, she's really annoying. A very contrived story with contradictions, e.g. Dad gets accidentally shot at funeral of his ex-wife, where, not only for totally unknown reasons a gang of funeral-goers decided to throw them out, but super soldier decides to fight them all & then also the cops. All so that dad can get killed poetically & with angst near the wife who abandoned him & his autistic kid...who is now a grown man & cold-blooded mass killer. Then, by another HUGE coincidence the guy defending his next target just happens to be his brother. And they have a fight where just stands & takes a beating from his brother, but seems totally invincible, like the guy is just slapping him with a small fish. The amazing savant accountant who's a genius at money laundering, somehow manages to get all his own money laundered through companies that are all in the same block where he has his own practice.Lets not mention (or lets mention) small geek annoyances, loose ends & magic happenings: like sniper bullets hitting at exactly the same time as the noise of the shot, or the guy just running around in the open while in a firefight with 5 men. Its like the A-Team. The huge thing about the Airstream trailer which is there so he can quickly disappear...except...throughout the whole movie, including when he disappears, he's driving around in exactly the same pickup truck. Law enforcement procedures too in this film are just 'convenience' or imagined procedures & lacking any kind of believability.Everything else, like the acting, is so-so (professional). Except, Jon Bernthal as the brother is great, as are the child actors. John Lithgow, his usual charismatic self.If you're not the sort to notice these sorts of things & is happy with a bit of super soldiering, mass killing, good guy with troubled life, then its probably a 7/10 movie."

Like why is every autist in films a savant? But i was able to see past those things because at the end of the day you have to write a movie and making Ben Affleck's character in this film merely socially awkward wouldve felt disrespectful.Other than that it has a great cast, J.K. Simmons is great as always, also its always nice to see Jeffrey Tambor. John Lithgow as well, even tho he is barely in it. I personally dont really care for Kendrick but she isnt a bad actress by any stretch so it didnt bother me.One last thing: I saw this film because of a youtube essay on plot twists, naming this movie as an example.

" High-functioning Ben Affleck stars in a fairly low-functioning film
",0.0,-0.9426,2017-12-06 00:00:00,4,"Ben Affleck stars as Christian Wolff - a high-functioning number-crunching accountant whom, unofficially, launders money and cooks the books for some of the most dangerous organisations in America. When he begins looking in to the accounts of one of his clients he discovers that the books don't add up and starts carrying out his own investigations; with the help of Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) whom is one of the firm's employees. However, as Christian continues to dig the body count continues to rise and matters are further complicated when the Treasury Department start to take a keen interest in Christian's activities...In many ways, The Accountant is a fairly standard action thriller (with the exception that the protagonist suffers from autism). This is an interesting set-up and perhaps in different hands this could have been an interesting film; the title character has a disorder that is difficult to diagnose and is probably something that many people don't have a great deal of knowledge about. Sadly, because The Accountant's autism isn't really explored or delved into in any way it often meant that I found myself watching Ben Affleck being mean and moody and listening to music every evening for 20 minutes as some kind of coping mechanism for his disorder. It's not particularly insightful, entertaining, or interesting, and sadly, when there isn't any focus on the action I found it to be a little on the dull side.In fairness, whenever Affleck has a gun in his hand the film is quite good - there is some tension here and there and some of the action sequences aren't bad. But when you sit there waiting for the next action scene to come around because you don't care about any of the characters, or any of their relevant investigations you've got yourself a problem and that's how I felt about The Accountant. Things are made worse at the end by the very lazy and contrived way that the film wraps everything up - I'm specifically referring to how it brings the brothers 'back together.' Like I said The Accountant himself may be high-functioning, but I wouldn't say the same thing about the film itself."

",0.0,-0.8263,2017-11-10 00:00:00,1,"How this movie gets 7 stars and not 2 or 3 at the most, just shows how moronic the modern movie audience is. This movie has the most ridiculous premise ever. A boy with severe autism grows up to be an accountant by day and an assassin by night?? Yeah right!! And as a kid whenever he is upset he has violent fits an starts destroying things around him. First of all kids with autism never become that aggressive. Second of all, a boy with autism that severe does not grow up to be an accountant and an assassin. He will need caring for the rest of his life. I happen to know people with autism and this is complete crap. And what kind of a mother leaves her family, because her son has autism?? The answer: no mother would. And whats with the apparently mute but normal younger brother? He never says a word. *SPOILER AEAD* The mute brother is actually one of the villains in present day film. Played by Jon Bernthal, the only actor, giving a good performance in this crap. And a man that is as good a shot as Afflecks character, should not need to wear glasses. Making people look smart by putting glasses on them is a cliche√©. Especially when he had to wear glasses all the time as a kid, but only when he's doing accounting as an adult. Teah right. And no, autism cannot be controlled and used through strict military training. The Karate Kid like scene in Indonesia is clich√©'e as well and ridiculous. I could, if not forgive, but maybe accept, this great insult to real people with autism, if this movie was even mildly entertaining. But after the most wooden acting I have ever seen from Ben Affleck, who looks as bored as the audience and 50 minutes with no action at all, I almost gave up watching it And since this movie tries to be realistic in its portrayal of a person with autism and their parents upbringing and it fails even at that, this movie just doesn't work. And the screenwriter should be taken outside and shot for writing a script this bad. And the moron comparing this crap to John Wick is well, a moron. John Wick 1 and 2 are action movies. A movie with the first 50 minutes consisting of people talking and Ben Affleck phoning in his lines and performance is not an action movie. And it's not a drama either. Just a pile of pretentious bullshit. The first action happens after 50 minutes. And an actual explanation of what's going on, you have to wait 90 minutes for. The other actors are just dull and actors like JK Simmons and John Lithgow are wasted here. Im just glad it was on Netflix and I didn't waste money watching this in a theater. Do not believe the wannabe-intellectuals that praise this movie and calls it an intellectual, smart, entertaining movie and best movie of the year and bullshit like that. They are as dumb and full of crap as this movie. And they clearly know nothing about autism and they have never seen good acting, since they praise Ben Afflecks terrible performance.

My opinion of ""The Accountant"" has not improved : it is indeed as messy and contradictory as I thought.The messiness is caused by a number of factors. Firstly, there is the plot, which is over-convoluted and over-rich to the point where it could supply two or three movies. Secondly, there is the protagonist's backstory, which tends to disappear where and when it becomes most interesting or compelling. Thirdly, there is the character of the Accountant (the said protagonist), who does everything and anything. And then he goes and does the opposite - or not. It's like watching a drunken contortionist trying to invent yet another way of reaching his right knee with his left elbow while scratching both his ears with his feet.While we're at it, I was pretty amazed by the education which the protagonist, an autist, received at the hands of his father. We're supposed to believe that the father's approach (think Tough Love military style) saved the boy and allowed him to grow into a relatively normal and well-adapted adult. It's more likely that the father's approach would result in creating an even more unhappy, stressed-out and conflicted child.We're not two hundred miles removed from a father fearing that his son might grow up gay - the horror ! - and dragging him from Manly occasion to Manly occasion : think football, rugby, deer hunting, horse riding, picking fights in bars, etc. Of course the child still grows up homosexual, albeit an homosexual who has learned to fear his parents and loathe himself. But to return to the movie : it's not a total loss. For instance, Mr Affleck gives a good performance and there are well-choreographed and well-executed fight scenes. If only the rest had been as well-thought- out and inventive..."

Throw in several sub-plots, and you've got complex story with some faults, but an overall pleasing experience. Director Gavin O'Connor (""Pride and Glory"" and ""Warrior"") weaves an intricate story of a man, born with Asperger's Syndrome, who uses his talent to become an exclusive financial consultant and auditor. His childhood exposure to martial arts, as required by his militaristic father, prepares him for a unique side-career. A very good cast includes Anna Kendrick, J.K. Simmons, John Lithgow, Jeffery Tambor, John Bernthal, and Jean Smart. In the title role, Ben Affleck gives a restrained performance, showing a victim of autism correctly. When he has to, he morphs into his violent side, as honed by his childhood training. The problem with this film is a matter of timing and flow. At times, especially in the scenes devoted to the accounting and applied math sub-plots, tend to get bogged down in unnecessary minutia.

" Ridiculously Good
",0.128,0.9985,2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie is 'RIDICULOUSLY' good! Ben Affleck plays Chris Wolff, an accountant living with a kind of autism that allows him to super focus on whatever he sets his mind to. His mind seems wired to solve puzzles and equations with ease. His only weaknesses: people skills, and an inability to stop things once he's begun them. Pairing the ladder with the years of physical training forced on him by his military father, you end up with a very capable man.Affleck is excellent in this role. His attitude and mannerisms are authentic, and he makes this frank, monotonous, stoic character extremely likable and easy to root for.Anna Kendrick plays a relatively small, but important role in the film as Dana, an accountant working at the robotics company where Wolff is hired to locate the problems in the books. Her character, having found the error in the books on a more superficial level spends a lot of time interacting with Wolff. As her role begins, she's used as a tool to make the lead more likable, but in the second act of the film she becomes Wolff's motivation. I thought she was great. Throwing aside sarcasm, she plays a character similar to her role in 50/50 (aka awkward and cheery). It's a role she does well, and I thought she was great in the film.Then you have Jon Bernthal who plays Braxton. I thought he was great in this film. He handles the physical scenes fantastically, as always. What really impressed me with his performance was the final scene between him and Wolff, in which his character is portrayed as vulnerable. In the past, I have always seen him as the tough guy (Baby Driver, Daredevil, The Walking Dead, etc.) and it nice to see how versatile his acting is. I know that the Punisher character was at times portrayed as vulnerable, but I think this was even better, and I loved him in Daredevil Season 2. I really believed his character in this film, and was glad to see him grow as an actor.Bernthal's character, however, did play into one of my big problems with this film, which was the predictability of it. I called it from the first scene in which he was introduced that they were brothers. I also knew from Lithgow's first scene that he was Bernthal's client. My only other problem with the film was the Treasury Department story going on throughout the film. I really didn't care what was going on with them, and to the best of my recollection, all their scenes could have been cut out without hurting the movie. Don't get me wrong. JK Simmons was great in this movie, as always, but his monologue did seem extremely scripted and stale.I also want to mention quickly the kid who played Christian Wolff, Seth Lee, who was fantastic. I have a nephew who is autistic, and I thought Lee did a great job portraying the personality and mannerisms of such an individual. I can only imagine how physically and emotionally draining the part had to be, and I have to give him credit for his work.All in all, I had a great time watching this movie. The story was compelling, the characters were likable, I never found my mind wandering. This film, with the exception of the Treasury scenes, was really tight, smart, and engaging. The action was pretty solid, and the direction was fantastic. With the minor problems I have with this film in mind, I'm giving The Accountant an 8/10."

Years later, he works as an accountant, but secretly fiddles the finances for various nefarious people and organisations. He eventually finds himself working for an honest one, in the shape of a robotics company, where he strikes up a relationship with co-worker Dana (Anna Kendrick.) But, as FBI agent Ray King (J.K. Simmons) closes in an investigation on him, Christian discovers corruption lurks everywhere.The world of autism gets another rare light shined on it, in this latest action thriller from Gavin O' Connor. Affleck's character feels like a force for the Autism Equality Movement, being a persona it's hard to accept as being accurate with the condition, which in O' Connor's mind is an ass-kicking, hard faced killer. That said, Affleck's portrayal feels just as hammy and forced as it's been in countless other on-screen incarnations. So, it helps no more, that while it's a fairly exciting and promising idea, the execution results in a flat and undelivering film.The mood of the film seems designed to reflect the world of the character, blurry and drowned out, with minimal to no humour throughout. Instead, it seems fixated on the story which, though intricate and fairly complex, is just not engaging or exciting enough to hold your attention throughout. A wide support cast, including Kendrick, Simmons and John Lithgow, further fail to make things any more worthy.While he may have been playing an accountant, for Affleck, this wasn't a worthy investment. **"
" Great movie - intriguing and entertaining
",0.7906,0.8689,2017-08-26 00:00:00,8,"The US Treasury Department is searching for a man who is the accountant to several global crime figures. They know him simply as The Accountant. The man himself is living a fairly inconspicuous existence as a practicing accountant. He is hired by Living Robotics, a tech firm, to go through their accounts after a junior accountant found some abnormalities. What he finds makes him a marked man...Great movie. Good plot with heaps of intrigue, twists and turns. The writer and director do well to not reveal too much too soon, aiding the suspense. Good action scenes too. Not overdone, and reasonably plausible, i.e. not your impossible, perfectly-choreographed stuff.Solid performance by Ben Affleck in the lead role. Good support from Anna Kendrick."
" Excellent, well crafted movie!
",0.7263,0.9665,2017-08-25 00:00:00,10,"This is an excellent film in every sense. It is finely crafted in every aspect that makes a film great. The plot is intricate and clever. The acting is superb. The atmosphere keeps the audience spellbound from one scene to the next. The story revolves around a brilliant accountant who has Aspergers and his struggles to get where he is, his family connections, a young lady the accountant falls for and two FBI agents who search for him. The usual bad guys are part of the mix as well. The audience questions what is really good and what is evil as the lines are blurred at times. I have seen this movie twice and enjoyed it even more the second time as it is filled with thought provoking ideas and challenges. Connections between the present and the past provide a rich layer to the film. It stays with you and you find yourself mulling over different scenes and find yourself thinking about connections especially family."
" some potential
",0.0,0.3143,2017-08-23 00:00:00,6,"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an autistic accountant with special skills. He works for shadowy criminal figures as a forensic accountant and has honed military skills using his autistic attention to details. Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) is a lowly accountant in Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow)'s robotics company. She has discovered some inconsistencies and Lamar's sister Rita (Jean Smart) hires Christian to do an audit. Brax (Jon Bernthal) and his men are murderous villains set to cover up the crime. Meanwhile, Ray King (J.K. Simmons) at the Treasury Department is hunting for the mysterious accountant. He blackmails analyst Marybeth Medina into the dangerous investigation.The setup and the first half promises a simple easy action thriller like another John Wick. My first complaint is the attempted romance with Kendrick. She may be in her 30s but she still looks like a teenager. It's odd to have her make the moves. The bigger issue is the need to build his history and deliver his portfolio. They're better off to leave some of that unspoken. It's also problematic to tie in Brax with his history. It should be an easy action climax but it gets too complicated for its own good. King and Medina would be better off cut out of the movie entirely. The damn thing is over two hours anyways."
" A Really Good Movie
",0.4927,0.9937,2017-08-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie is not what I expected. I assumed it was about a former assassin hiding out as an accountant who gets mixed up in some plot where he has to untangle the web in order to save himself and the girl. Affleck is fantastic as Chris Wolf, a functioning autistic who also is an accountant. He is hired to do forensic bookkeeping jobs by major corporations, including illegal ones. This brings him to the attention of Simmons' treasury agent, Ray King. Ray is retiring so he brings in a young Treasury agent, Cynthia Addai-Robinson's Marybeth Medina, to help him track down Chris. There are several flashbacks to Chris' upbringing by a stern, military father with a background in psy-ops. When Chris is hired by a robotics company to look into missing funds that were found by the company's in-house accountant, Anna Kendrick's Dana Cummings, it sets off a chain of events that put Chris and Dana in the cross hairs of assassins led by a menacing Jon Bernthal.Affleck does a really good job of portraying Chris as autistic and obsessive. He doesn't overplay the role and does it justice. He is kind, lonely, and struggles with his inner demons, but at the same time longs for human companionship. He befriends Dana as well as a an elderly couple whose taxes he did and they become his surrogate family.J.K. Simmons is great as always in the role of the retiring agent who has a few secrets of his own. Bernthal's assassin is both menacing and charming, in a way. Robinson does a decent job with the role of the idealistic agent brought in by Agent King, but she was a bit too stiff for my taste. The role made her almost as anti- social as Chris. Being driven is one thing, being boringly intense is another. They tried to give her some depth with a backstory but it felt really tacked on.Kendrick is a fine actress and she's cute, perky, and a bit frenetic, which is her charm. But she is wasted in this role of the damsel in distress. She serves just to provide someone for Chris to save and to move us on to the next action sequence. She did well in the role, but it should have been more weighted.The action is top notch. In a way it reminded me of Clive Owen's Shoot 'em Up!. The killing is mindless, brutal, gory, and so much fun. The stunts are great and Affleck is really settling in as an action star, like his best friend, Matt Damon. The plot is well written and while it was a bit confusing trying to follow all the accounting lingo, it was interesting. Numbers don't lie and I enjoyed the accounting class I took in college for the same reason Dana mentions in the movie: ""I like the balance of it.""The Accountant is a top-notch thriller as well as a fun action romp. I'm looking forward to the sequel."
" A modern Robin Hood, Dirty Harry and Superman
",-0.4404,0.8947,2017-08-10 00:00:00,8,"""The Accountant"" is an interesting mystery-crime-action film with a different twist. The hero has an autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome. While having difficulty with social skills, he has extremely high cognitive skills. Added to that are highly trained skills in self- defense and fighting, and in knowledge of arms, weaponry, security and computers. To boot, he's an ace marksman with a high-powered sniper rifle. This is all a bit far-fetched for someone with autism ‚Äì for so many exceptional skills (where one or two are usually the order). But it makes for a more interesting movie. And, we learn that the hero comes by the arms and fighting skills as a result of training. His dad was an Army colonel. He says Christian will be looked down upon, mocked and bullied. So, he trains Christian and his brother (who doesn't have autism) to survive.As the film progresses, we learn that Wolff is a sort of combination Robin Hood, Superman, Dirty Harry, and self-appointed vigilante. He deals justice as he sees fit. In this case, it's bringing down the corrupt entities within huge corporations. He mixes that with some pro bono tax accounting work for common, everyday folks. Ben Affleck plays Christian Wolff. A further interesting aspect of the plot is an FBI agent who has been tracking the accountant. He admires this guy who is exposing and bringing down crooks in the corporate world. But Ray King (played by J.K. Simmons) has been frustrated because he hasn't been able to identify the accountant. Other key characters in the story are Dana Cummings (played by Anna Kendrick), Marybeth Medina (played by Cynthia Adai-Robinson), and Lamar Blackburn (played by John Lithgow) The acting is good all around, and the production values of the film are all very good. Even with the good-guy aspects of Wolff, the amount and level of violence and seeming indifference to killing earn this film its R rating. It's not a movie for everyone. But mature adults who enjoy this type of modern action film with considerable violence will enjoy ""The Accountant"" for its unusual plot twists. I found one humorous line in the film, though I'm not sure it was intended to be such. Dana Cummings says to Christian Wolff, ""Why would your clients follow you? You're an accountant."""
" Decent Watch, Give it a go certainly.
",0.34,0.9494,2017-08-08 00:00:00,6,"I found 'The Accountant', as I have stated above, decent at most. The movie starts with some decent action, then it goes into a little drama, of which I found a little slow moving. The action scenes are all fantastic. The special effects, props, acting..all great, however I just feel the drama scenes in the storyline dragged on a little, just a little. All and all a decent watch and you certainly wont be disappointing with this title, but you will not be blown away either. Enjoy! :)"
" Not much Accounting
",0.0,0.9687,2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"Being along time fan of accounting movies can mean a long time between drinks, so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I have to say I was a little disappointed, sure it has a big 'set piece' accounting scene about a third of the way in but that's you lot really. In all honestly its more of a wrestling movie than an accounting movie.Still the acting is nicely understated and the story rolls along OK on the Debit side I give it a 8.45612 and following the traditions of double entry bookkeeping (totally absent from the film) It gets a credit 2.7123 giving a balance of 5.7 (correct to two significant digits)"
" An one-actor based creation, with incoherent script
",0.2732,0.9259,2017-08-07 00:00:00,7,"When some actors get both fame and seniority, they are eager to choose scripts where their character has heavy domination, both by time on screen and intensity. We all know e.g. Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio entering this path, and Ben Affleck has definitely followed them. Without any doubt, he measures up to in the Accountant as in many previous movies, but why include many splendid character actors (Anna Kendrick, J. K. Simmons, John Lithgow) to perform small and static parts? Not speaking of odd script with lots of been-there/seen-that stuff, predictable angles and odd ending? Several flashbacks added confusion, and the level of autism seen when Chris was younger and at present do not correspond to the real course of this disease. Pointing out more inconsistencies would simply need to tick the spoiler alert - that I do not intend to...So, The Account as such is not a bad movie, but based on the cast, I did expect something more solid and integral. Or, perhaps, the problem lies with the director whose most works have been ""flawed"" in many ways?"
" Rating: A-
",0.0,0.999,2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this film, once again my Christmas' movies are not disappointing me. Amazing action scenes, good characters, a great cast with an excellent performance from Ben Affleck and an unconventional narrative that brings a story full of twists. It does have some problems, but not enough to take me out of the captivating entertainment.The Accountant is not a movie for everyone, it has an extremely non- linear way to go through the plot (flashbacks, sequences out of order, ...) and that can make a lot of people dislike this film, which can be proved by the huge number of mixed reviews. Not me, not at all. There are a couple of scenes that are shown at the very beginning and only explained at the very end, which I love because it made me THINK! This isn't the usual ""action"" movie where I just watch it as it rolls without really thinking about it, this one actually needs and expects me to go through the details and all the clues that it gives. There are a lot of twists throughout the film and since I actually thought about a lot of the plot's little hints, I was able to figure it out most of them before the heavy exposition scene (more about this at the end of the review).Ben Affleck keeps proving to every hater that he's an amazing actor. Ever since he started directing as well that his actor's skills improved a lot, he's able to capture everything someone with his character's conditions would have and I couldn't get enough of him. I felt super invested in his backstory, I wanted to know him better, how he got to where he was, how he became who he is and how he dealt with his family response to his special gift. What a performance! What a character!The rest of the cast doesn't fall behind: Anna Kendrick is sweet, charming and lively as always; J.K. Simmons plays Ray King, who runs the Crime Enforcement Division department, and he's as brilliant as one would expect; Jon Bernthal plays Brax, another badass like Christian that gives some delightful action pieces. Speaking about this last topic, Gavin O'Connor does a beautiful job directing the action sequences throughout the whole movie, exceptionally well choreographed and well shot. A lot of scenes made me exclaim ""ouch"" out loud since the stunt work is so realistic. Well done!The pacing is slightly off sometimes. I love the fact that the movie takes its time to develop its characters and it does it elegantly, all the characters have great depth to them, but there are some small moments where it does drag a little bit. Still, this is a minor issue. The real problems come below.This is such an unconventional movie that it's hard to place it in any genre. It has action, comedy, romantic comedy, drama and some thriller-like moments, which if not well-balanced, gives an uneven tone. The balance is indeed off, the film's tone goes around and around, which isn't able to be smoothed out because there are also a lot of sub-plots that seemed main plots, but these are dropped by the end of the movie ... It's just more unbalanced details that don't help the movie flow as it should.Finally, I get to the huge exposition scene near the end. I don't feel that it isn't necessary, I know it is, but not like this. Many of the information received is unnecessary and it's soooooo long. J.K. Simmons basically explains the whole movie in five minutes and it took away all the mystery and intrigue that the film was having until then. It's such a lazy way to show the twists that it kind of lost the impact that it should have had. By far, my biggest problem with the last act.Even if The Accountant's flaws are there, they don't overcome the great cast's chemistry and the wonderful narrative. Amazing action stunts, well-developed characters, a magnificent third act (which has a final twist that blew me away, I was completely surprised by it) and a pitch-perfect Ben Affleck. Overall, I see myself watching it again, it has a big re-watchable touch to it.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Not sure if B movie or not - but I liked it
",-0.5391,0.995,2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"Don't have the money to make the super-production of your life? Can't afford big booms, expensive equipment, CGI scenes? Doesn't matter - just take a pair of Hollywood-standard federal investigators to assist leading a criminal story and help extending the runtime, add some shady background to the main character with his family and don't forget about some good old fighting scenes. Scratching the surface of some topic unknown to the average viewer (accounting, mathematics, autism) might work too. But hey, what is Ben Affleck doing here? Honestly, I have no idea, but I'm happy that Hollywood scrapped the likes of Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal for this role. I tried my best to not categorize The Accountant as a B-movie, but no other marking seemed to fit it. Very typified locations and actions, lack of detail, average cinematography, perfect headshots that even the best snipers would envy. Yet in the end it works. What amazed me that even the supporting actors showed their best. Hope this movie can earn them higher profile roles in the future - they deserve it. So this might be a B-movie, but a masterfully implemented one. Definitely worth a watch, there are some twists in the story, but don't expect too much surprise."
" This Excellent, Original Action Concept Takes a Wobbly First Step
",0.7184,-0.5823,2017-07-19 00:00:00,6,"Ben Affleck plays a highly-functioning autistic man who cracks books by day and skulls by night, squashing threats of both a physical and financial nature for a wide range of criminal enterprises. I appreciate the basic concept, of a man with zero social capabilities who finds rhythm and peace in his very precise, specific line(s) of work, but the surrounding story is so worried about pulling one over on the viewer that it often feels too clever for its own good. Character motivations are a major issue, for example, with many players making an absurd, nonsensical about-face at crunch time. Even the anti-hero protagonist isn't immune to this, having less than no time for his female counterpart (Anna Kendrick) one day, then suddenly risking life and limb for her the next. That disconnect badly affects their on-screen relationship, far more than the abundant personality quirks brought about by his disorder. Affleck is great in the lead role, delivering precisely the mix of nerdy intellect and rough physical wherewithal necessary to bridge the two core aspects of his character. He works very well as both an antisocial genius and a ruthless, methodical, cold-blooded killer, and makes us forget about how unlikely a pairing that really is. That makes me think there's potential for more films in this franchise, even if its gimmicky, over-twisted first plot was a letdown."
" (Spoilers) - an underrated and misunderstood film
",-0.34,0.8835,2017-07-18 00:00:00,9,"Underrated and highly misunderstood. It's been unfairly rated by some reviewers stating that this film makes Aspergers a superpower. The main character's skills are the result of his unique upbringing by his father and years of honed practice, not his Aspergers. As shown by the other kids in the School who DIDN'T become assassins. Anyone else (let's say his brother) would have turned out the same, brought up under the same conditions, without Aspergers. Some reviewers clearly don't pay attention. It's well paced, told a good story, had a good level of action and a touch of humour."
" Ben Affleck is PERFECT as The Accountant
",0.6633,0.6756,2017-07-15 00:00:00,9,"If you cross Rain Main with The Terminator the result is The Accountant... someone who can not only focus on the intricate details of what he is doing, he can take decisive (sometimes violent) action when he thinks that such action is the proper course of action, proper according to his moral code Becoming a criminal because his only friend was pushed into a situation where he was killed, horribly, he was still human enough to pause his life to protect an innocent woman... I would have added another point to my rating if he and the woman had done more than talk and look at each other, leading to a situation where he had to fight with himself over keeping her with him, or leaving her behind... maybe the sequel (if there is one) will show him taking the next step into opening himself to that life particular experience I don't know if the producer or director considered any other actors, but if they did... they made exactly the right choice by casting Ben Affleck... he was PERFECT as the Accountant"

Because of that, I don't always run to see his movies. I definitely didn't jump on the chance to see this movie and watched it only recently because it was on HBO and there was nothing else on TV. I wish I hadn't waited so long to see it, because it was surprisingly a really good movie. So much so that I watched it again the next day and am thinking I may watch it again tonight. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, the characters and the acting. Ben impressed me this time and Anna was as charming as always."
" Numbers and weapons
",-0.4404,0.9906,2017-07-04 00:00:00,6,"The Accountant is an action film starring Ben Affleck a man with some unusual skills for an accountant. He's good with numbers in the same way that Dustin Hoffman was good with them in Rain Man. He's a savant with a lot of social skills lacking. But he's great at martial arts and has the expert shooting eye of a trained marksman sniper. Romance is kept to a minimum in The Accountant.Tycoon John Lithgow hires Affleck to find out where money has been disappearing for the past few years. Affleck traces it down, but then bodies start dropping and Affleck himself comes in harm's way.There's an involved prologue in The Accountant showing Affleck's background as a kid in a military family. The only friend he really has is a younger brother. In the end the reason for the prologue becomes clear as Treasury Agent J.K. Simmons explains his peculiar relationship with a numbers who can double as a killer.The plot in The Accountant gets a bit over involved but there's enough action to make up for it for fans of action. Look also for good performances from Affleck's assigned assistant Anna Kendrick, Cynthia Addai Robinson as Simmons's assistant at Treasury and contact hit man Jon Bernthal who has a most unusual relationship dynamic with Affleck.Enough action to satisfy."
" Not a mystery
",0.0,0.9724,2017-06-24 00:00:00,4,"At the end the movie seems to want to make a positive statement about the character (as a ""a math savant"" or something like that) but in fact it makes him look awful.This is not a mystery. I thought it would be; I thought that a movie about an accountant would be a good mystery. In fact the fact that he is an accountant is irrelevant. This is about 95% action and thriller and about 5% mystery.The IMDb description of the movie says that Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is a math savant. Ben Affleck is not believable to me as a ""math savant""; he does not even try to act like one. He says his lines that are supposed to make him a math savant but does nothing more to act like one.The explanation that Christian Wolff needed extraordinary military training is not logical to me. We all need to defend ourselves but most ""savants"" like him don't get the extraordinary military training that Christian Wolff got.Anna Kendrick is cute. I like her, especially in this movie but this is the only movie I have seen her in. In this movie I think they show her (her character) on an ID card or business card and if so then I don't understand that part.At the beginning of the movie there is a boy with problems, such as autism, but they are intentionally vague about what it is. I think I understand who the boys is supposed to be later in the movie but there are too many things like that that are too vague for me.This is the second movie I have reviewed recently that has 9-star and 10-star reviews in the first page and then the second page of reviews have some that are less than 8 stars."

He takes a job and discovers millions are being skimmed from this company. Well, it's the guy at the top that is doing the skimming, so he's willing to hire assassins to kill the accountant, Wolff, and the assistant, Dana. What he doesn't know, is Wolff has a lot of dangerous clients, like the mob, so he's equipped to handle himself. And what doesn't make sense is Wolff's brother is involved and is the killer hired by the bad guy. Sorry, I don't buy that coincidence. So, as I'm sure you can guess, he takes care of the bad guys, changes his identity, and is on his merry way.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, decent story.

I was very confused about it's intentions when it was over. This a movie in a very tiny and odd genre like Tiptoes with Matthew McConaughey. Tiptoes was at least kinda funny.

" The Super Accountant
",0.5994,0.9081,2017-06-17 00:00:00,2,"The Accountant, attempting to actually develop characters and attack questions of morality by introducing nuance, shortly becomes reduced to the typical action movie conspiracy poop. By adding a backstory to the clich√©d hero protagonist, played by Ben Affleck, the creators hope to add depth. What they do add is ruined by everything else in the movie.The story involves a super accountant that is supposedly better than any other accountant in the world, has superhuman fighting abilities, is rich enough to support an autistic service center with cutting-edge technologies, is more talented than James Bond at being a spy, and can't make small talk at all. However, he has a troubled past, which is surprisingly well done, excluding the acting. This horrendously ridiculous and amateurish plot includes a half-baked love story, which makes no sense whatsoever, between Kendrick and Affleck; forgotten brotherly relationships; strained parental connections; and confusing, horribly introduced, plot-twisting conspiracies. If this film had any potential whatsoever (and I think it did), it was completely obscured by the events of the movie ‚Äì and then the acting.Ben Affleck is played by a stone statue in this movie. If the accountant he plays has more than one emotion, I would be incredibly surprised. The director could have hired a puppeteer technician to attach strings to a stone look-a-like of Ben Affleck and just use that. Instead, we have Ben Affleck to stare through the screen with his completely empty and expressionless eyes. Somehow Affleck managed to turn in a worse performance than the child actors used in the flashbacks. Affleck and his counterpart in his flashbacks should have been striving for something like Leonardo DiCaprio in What's Eating at Gilbert Grape (1993), but they should have just hired DiCaprio to play both the older and younger Christian Wolff. Talent is wasted in this film (like any other action movie) with the likes of Anna Kendrick, J.K. Simmons, and Jeffrey Tambor. I never thought I would see a more robotic performance than Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator (1984), but at least Arnie was supposed to be a robot.With nothing exceptional in the technical categories, the director and writer fail with everything else. At certain moments, the movie seemed to have the qualities of an actually good film. Unfortunately, the good parts of this movie met Ben Affleck and the rest of the movie."

You can see quite a few things and predict them coming. That doesn't change the impact they are having on the movie watching experience. Also Anna Kendrick is in this.Alright maybe not everyone is as amazed by her presence as I am, but I did not make that part of my rating. I would have gone higher if I had (no pun intended). And while she is sort of the Damsel in distress, she also carries her own weight character wise. There is a reason Ben Afflecks character does what he does of course and why he seems so cold from the outside. It's almost as if he saw Heat and took De Niros advice to heart ... Almost"

Watched this off of my DVR recently, really not expecting much. Honorable mention to Kendrick, she was really good in her role and the chemistry between her character and Christians was palpable. There are honestly no bad actors in this film but Ben knocks it out of the park. So intense and over the top was his performance, exactly what it needed to be, I was mesmerized. Oscar worthy, in my opinion, an acting master class."

Despite the action/body count the average person will have much trouble connecting all the dots in this far-fetched flick that just serves to inflate Affleck's ego even more. Charles Bronson perhaps could have pulled this off but Affleck is a lame, limp substitute that should stop trying to show how macho he is. This movie got 2 stars just for J.K.

" Affleck's vigilante accountant superhero is strictly for comic book aficionados
",0.0,-0.9481,2017-06-11 00:00:00,5,"Critics on Metacritic got it right when they gave The Accountant a mediocre rating of ""51."" It's a story that wants it both ways. On one hand, Ben Affleck's Chris Wolff, a high functioning autistic math savant, is the victim of his army psychological warfare father, who has his son trained in martial arts and turns him into a virtual killing machine. On the other hand, Director Gavin O'Connor, writer Bill Dubuque and star Affleck, are all complicit in serving up a protagonist who really is nothing more than a one-dimensional vigilante with a heart of gold.The Accountant has trouble building suspense in the beginning by flipping back and forth between a series of expositional scenes. Not only are there flashbacks to Wolff's childhood but there is also a subplot involving Ray King, the director of FinCEN in the Treasury Department played by the ubiquitous J.K. Simmons who conscripts Marybeth Medina, a young data analyst, by blackmailing her over her juvenile record on a Federal Employment application. In addition, there's a secondary subplot involving Wolff's brother Braxton, a murderous hit-man, as well as a flashback to King's encounter with Wolff who easily exacts revenge on a bunch of Mafia cronies at a New York social club.The love interest here is Dana Cummings, the in-house accountant of ""Living Robotics"" played by girl-next-door Anna Kendrick. It's Cummings who discovers financial irregularities in the books and Wolff is called in to figure out what's going on. In perhaps the film's best scene, Affleck does his Clark Kent impersonation as the mild-mannered accountant utilizing a prodigious memory to uncover the $61 million embezzlement during an all-night bender replete with calculations plastered on the walls and windows of the office he's working in.Meanwhile brother Braxton forces the diabetic Chief Financial Officer of Living Robotics to commit suicide by taking an overdose of insulin. Behind this is the two-faced CEO Lamar Blackburn, played by a highly effective John Lithgow. The action ramps up when Blackburn's goons (including Braxton) go after Cummings and of course she is saved by Wolff, who throws off his Clark Kent mantle and now operates in full Jason Bourne mode.Wolff never rises above a typical comic book action figure as the film's scenarists soft pedal his past associations with a host of murderous thugs. Wolff's past bad interactions are only alluded to when Medina shows her boss surveillance images of Wolff with the bad guys in various exotic locations throughout the world. It seems that Wolff accepts payment for his services on a non-cash basis‚Äîcomic books and rare paintings are payments he accepts.It's soon revealed that Wolff landed in a Federal penitentiary not for his dealings with thugs but for an argument that erupts at his (divorced) mother's funeral resulting in shots fired and his father's death. Wolff befriends a federal informant while in prison who ends up being tortured to death by Gambino crime family associates. The massacre at the social club is Wolff's payback for the torture of federal informant friend. Not only does Wolff easily escape federal custody (off screen) but also easily gains entry into the social club where he dispatches the Mafioso. Good guy Wolff also fails to kill (then) agent King and starts funneling tips on criminal activity to King, who is promoted to director at the Treasury Department.If this isn't ludicrous enough, Wolff (now in full comic book mode), guns down a slew of bad guys back at Living Robotics and bonds with brother Braxton after a convenient fistfight. Both Wolff and Braxton are seemingly forgiven for their past indiscretions and walk off into the sunset practically hand in hand. The cavalier manner in which Wolff dispatches Blackburn is the final straw in elevating vigilantism to time-honored practice as extrajudicial action is justified in the name of the protection of the community.The Accountant's ultimate attraction is the variation on the Superman theme‚Äîa Clark Kent nebbish turning into a man of steel. Due to its dubious morality and comic book underpinnings, it never rises to the realm of a serious character study."
" Action Movie With A Twist.
",0.0,0.6385,2017-06-11 00:00:00,5,"The accountant as Robocop. Multiple flashbacks tell us that Ben Affleck was either an autistic child or the autistic child's brother. I couldn't which child grew up to be Ben Affleck but it doesn't really affect the plot. In any case a treatment center offers to take in the autist. Ben's father is an army officer and adamant about seeing to it that BOTH his young sons grow up to be hard chargers who never quit. Dad is a tough-minded kind of guy, straight out of an unholy interpretation of Friedrick Nietsche, a testicle with legs. ""Was mich nicht umbringt macht mich st√§rker."" Affleck the man punishes himself like a flagellant because whatever doesn't kill him makes him stronger. In Southeast Asia Dad teaches little Affleck the manly art of getting the hell kicked out of him by a huge martial arts master, who objects to the treatment of the bloodied and exhausted boy, struggling to get to his feet. ""Carry on,"" says Dear Old Dad to the martial arts master. Affeck can shoot flawlessly. ""You have a choice: be either a winner or a victim. The choice is yours,"" says Dad, echoing some current political figure -- I forget whom.I suspected that Affleck used to be the autist -- I nodded out towards the end -- because he is withdrawn, taciturn, and literal minded but I may easily have been wrong. Both the young kids are treated with equal brutality. The movie also promotes the notion that autists always have some hidden superhuman talent. In truth that's not actually the case. Most autistic kids grow up to lead highly ritualized and socially disengaged but otherwise relatively normal lives, capable of holding certain kinds of jobs. In Affleck's case, he's a mathematical wizard, and accountant who can do in an energetic flash what it would take a Krey computer ten million geological epochs to accomplished. He makes a fortune but lives a hermetic existence, holed up in a trailer in a self-storage park. He keeps bundles of unused cash in his drawer and gives much of it away to charity. His only indulgences are one genuine Matisse and one genuine Pollack, one on the wall, one on the ceiling. You can tell there is still some lingering abnormalities here. How would you like to get in bed every night, lie back, and stare at a Jackson Pollack painting as you drift off. ""Who knows what dreams may come?"" I was confused upon learning this because he shows no interest in anything but his job in everyday life. He's an uptight rude kind of accountant for hire, all suits and ties with no eye contact. Maybe, just maybe, he's also a hit man because he slaughters evildoers by the dozens. As I said, I nodded off, and maybe all the exposition came at the end and I missed it. What I DID watch was a more or less ordinary action movie. It could have been Steven Seagal. He beats the crap out of those with no morals and shoots their brains out. Those we see him kill are all bad guys who work for the head honcho, John Lithgow, whose roles lately have tended towards villainy. The reason Affleck kills these guys is that he's discovered some high-echelon scheme to skim money out of a robotics firm, and Lithgow, who now runs the business, wants the secret kept, so Lithgow kills everyone who might try to help Affleck finding out what, or who, is under the rock. That includes the winsome young secretary, Anna Kendrick, who is precisely half Affleck's height. After he saves her, the director mistakenly allows her to become angry, shouting at Affleck, while he shuffles nervously around his trailer with a gun in his hand. She's in a position to know better than to do that. But later, when he puts them up in a gilded hotel room, she puts moves on him. He avoids the engagement by repeating some distracting childhood rhyme and sliding away from her. It's a difficult binary role: arid accountant or superman. Affleck handles it surprisingly well. One or two of the supporting players also are satisfying. J. K. Simmons and Cynthia Addai-Robinson are both outstanding as a team from the Treasury Department trying to track down ""the accountant."" What the movie appears to be is ""Rain Man,"" in which the autist is yanked out of a light-hearted comedy, turned into an invulnerable Robocop and thrust into an ordinary action movie. As an action movie, it gets the job done, but the underlying message, if there is one, is a little worrisome. Do the people who greenlighted this production expect us to ADMIRE Affleck's life style, his philosophy, such as it is? Are they trying to tell us to MAN UP? Should we think more of ourselves if we were able to decapitate someone with a .50 caliber sniper's weapon at 200 yards? If so, I'm content to be a Nietschean weakling. I'm too tired to beat anyone up."

" Some great parts in the second half, but it struggles overall
",-0.1779,0.988,2017-06-04 00:00:00,6,"The Accountant (2016)The second half of this movie is terrific. That's a fair warning if you start and find it confusing and slow. It's also a shame, because the first half intends to create a lot of set up situations quietly and with complexity. The direction (and editing) couldn't handle pieces of the plot and it's an unnecessary muddle.Having half a good movie isn't all bad, and Affleck is decent in his role as a functioning adult with Aspergers. This is sometimes presented as an important feature of the movie, but there are so many other movies who give insight (and sympathy, if that's the idea) to people with emotional or functional challenges, this one doesn't really stand out. You might wish the first half of the movie had some kind of magic, a mood or cinema magic, to make this a really special film. But director Gavin O'Connor is an undistinguished action picture kind of director not inclined to anything too artful or new. Instead the movie shows straight up movie making, not bad, not worth noticing. The point is to get to know the characters and the plot so that the second half can make sense and be effective. And that's not enough, with fairly obvious character types and a plot that has layers but depends on convolution rather than original thinking to succeed. So take this kind of smokescreen movie for what it is, with patience."

It went a long way toward selling Ben Affleck's math savant by day, ripped vigilante by night. That's some serious B-movie potential right there.The actual movie doesn't live up to that promise, primarily because it's juggling all manner of subplots divergent from that main hook. Subplots involving J.K. Simmons' low-rent Treasury agent, a tech firm's corruption angle and a forbidden romance with Anna Kendrick. It's kind of all over the road.You've gotta give Affleck credit for hurling himself into this; he really brings to life an autistic character, even making it somehow believable that this guy can be a badass. And it's a lot of fun when he goes to work, moving directly into Batman beatdowns and John Wick head shots. The downside is that the fun isn't consistent.6/10"

Behind those eyes is a man who can turn on the charm in a second - but doesn't. Behind those eyes is a man who can play a sex symbol. This man can play an assassin - and does - but how difficult that must be, given the roles that come to mind just seeing the guy on the screen?Ben Affleck does it well. The story is clever, simple, straightforward with some twists the viewer will appreciate.Above all, the very fact that such a good movie can be made with this title makes accounting - possibly sexy.

In The Accountant, he got to play both and do some of his Batman to boot. Despite the silly title, Affleck's unconvincing depiction of an autistic person, and a plot that sometimes lost focus, this was a surprisingly good film. Making up for these deficiencies were the great action scenes, graphic violence and satisfying conclusion. It's your basic action film with a few interesting twists but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining."

The early scenes from his childhood show a tough upbringing from his father who teaches him self defense and martial arts because he knew he would get bullied because he's autistic. Affleck's character does shady book keeping for drug lords and is paid off in expensive gifts and artwork. He takes a job digging into a law firm's records and as he nears the truth about what is going on, assassins come after him to try and kill him to keep from uncovering the truth.All this wrapped up in a love story as he falls for the main female character played by Anna Kendrick and fights to protect her from the killers.This is an exciting movie, very similar to other thrillers, and there are some intense fight scenes, but all in all the movie ties together nicely at the end with a surprise ending."
" ""The Accountant"": Murder and Mayhem with a Message
",-0.6908,0.9724,2017-05-17 00:00:00,6,"Some of you may have gathered by now that I am not a big Mega-Cineplex-Spectacular Whiz-Bang Kick-Butt Multi-Screen Obscene-Budget Boffo-Box-Office-Buster kinna flick fan. I tend to migrate more toward the smaller, stranger sentient stuff myself. Not that Colossal=Crap necessarily. Perhaps it just turns out that more often than not, or certainly then it OUGHTA be, it does. Which is by way of leading into my short and sweet review of last year's audience fave ""The Accountant"" starring the oft-maligned Ben Affleck in the most unusual title role.Ol' Ben seems to be the go-to whipping boy for movie critics and patrons far and wide. And I really can't put my finger on exactly why this is. Nevertheless, it is. Maybe it's just that the dude is perceived by many as coming off ""too perfect"" and, at times, even a little smarmy for some. I get that, I guess. Kind of. Still, I find myself liking most everything I see him act in, direct or both act in and direct. And this now includes ""The Accountant"".Affleck does a more than admirable job with a weird role of a financial analyst genius who doubles as a paid hit man. Oh, by the way, did I mention that he's also autistic? This fantastical story grabbed and held my undivided attention for over two hours. That right there should tell you something of a reasonably redemptive nature.I also admire the fact that this film makes a game attempt to explore and investigate the mysterious world of an autistic and the myriad of challenges and frustrations that are inherent within it. Now granted, the manner in which Affleck's character is presented, and the way in which the actor chooses to portray him, may or may not be entirely medically and/or clinically accurate here. This notwithstanding, however, the enduring message that recognizing and diagnosing autism in children has undergone nothing short of a paradigm shift in recent decades is made poignantly clear. And yet, despite these giant and commendable strides forward, ""The Accountant"" also helps to reinforce the unshakable reality that we've still got a helluva long way to go."

But, admittedly, I'm not too convinced that Ben nailed this character, though I don't necessarily have a problem with his portrayal. Jon Bernthal's delivery however, was wonderful and fun to watch. Anna Kendrick, sadly all I ever see when watching her, is ""that fairly annoying character from Twilight"".All in all though, even with being able to predict its twists long before they happen, The Accountant is incredibly enjoyable and has the potential of being much more, that what it is now.

The story is about a special needs person who is a genius but as an adult becomes an accountant for the mafia and is forever troubled by his upbringing so can justifiably murder whoever he likes.

But I was very pleasantly surprised that it wasn't. Ben Affleck plays the accountant in the movie, a very different type of man, but an extremely gifted man too. Anna Kendrick plays a woman who briefly works alongside Affleck and kinda gets dragged into all the mess he gets into. The movie has an intriguing plot that is interesting and entertaining to see unfold. There are things we are unsure of until the ending, which is what kept me watching to be honest. Knowing that there was probably going to be a good pay off at the end is what kept me engaged and focused on this movie. At the beginning I did not think I was going to like it at all, just didn't seem like my kind of film, but I was wrong. You don't have to love action movies to enjoy this movie, in fact the action aspect of the film is not a very large portion of what the movie is, it spends more time getting to know the main characters and giving backstory to them so you can connect with them better. The good writing does that for the characters too. The interactions between Kendrick and Affleck are well done and I also liked the interactions between Affleck and his brother in the film. Overall it's a smart well done movie. 8/10."

",0.4767,0.9669,2017-04-20 00:00:00,8,"The Accountant surprised the heck out of me. I expected a boring, simple plot with average acting. Instead this film has a great plot and outstanding acting, especially by Affleck and JK Simmons.Affleck plays Christian Wolff, a highly functional autistic man who has genius-level mathematical skills, but very limited social skills. Affleck terrifically holds the emotional line down to almost flat line levels. You learn that Affleck uses his skills to figure out how very nefarious organizations are losing money. He ""uncooks the books"" as they called it in the movie.You learn that not only can Wolff use math skills, but he also has terrific self-defense and weapons skills thanks to training from his family. There are many complex relationships with so many characters. The director does a masterful job of bringing you to someplace, then pausing, then bringing you someplace completely different, emotionally. Happy, sad, frightened, and back to hopeful.This story is not super complex, but has many twists and turns that will have you saying - ah ha - many times. It had me cheering several times as the plot seemed sometime similar to the old Death Wish movies of Charles Bronson, where a good man starts extracting revenge on bad people and morphs. Add the autistic overlay and that was genius.The only fault I found is the somewhat predictable ending. Also, some of the killing seemed to fall to the level of the Commando movie from Schwarzenegger in fact. But the autistic overlay made you just say, OK, this guy has no emotions. I loved The Accountant. Had it been a better ending, it would have been considered a masterpiece. As it is, it's a super solid entertaining movie with lots of actions, plenty of violence, an outstanding plot, and superb acting by all characters. Bank on it - you will enjoy The Accountant."

It was definitely more of a clap than a gunshot ... over and over and over ... and that sensory overload sequence ... I get it, I don't need it waking the neighbors.Doubtful Ben will win an award for this. Sure he played a person with a disability and that's usually a shoe-in for awards, but he needed to be more ""special,"" lets say. Lack of expression is not good acting. This reminded me more of Kurt Russell in Soldier, one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I couldn't help imagining the pitch meeting. Agent: ""No acting at all, no dialog either. All you have to do is walk around completely expressionless and shoot people."" Kurt, ""I'm in."""

There is plenty of action and not the kind of overly exaggerated action like in most of the action movies. Ben Affleck is the accountant, a highly trained mathematician wonder, a result from his autism as a kid. Raised by his father to weapon himself in life against people who could mock him he becomes a fighting machine. Due to his autism he lacks emotion, something he would like to change in his life. The story is well written and entertaining, with the right balance of action and drama. The cast is also well chosen, with all actors that bring something to the story.

Ben Affleck has recently moved up in my favorite actors book after watching this movie, Live by night and also some of the older Ben Affleck movies I must say he is really a multifaceted actor. This movie in the beginning shows the emotional strains of dealing with a child with mental disorder and the coping mechanism employed then it turns into a hit-man type movie, it's like a drama/action.

The story is absolutely amazing. It should touch everyone who appreciates intelligent writing and although revolving around the challenges autistic people experience to adapt to the world, it should uplift the spirits of everyone who is ""different"" and struggles to be accepted! Christian Wolff is a man with high-functioning autism. One of the characteristics of HFA is the exceptionally high IQ. Individuals with HFA often have difficulties in areas of communication, expression, and social interaction. That is the case with Chris. His father, a military psychologist, afraid that his autistic son may be taken advantage of, decides to prepare him for the world by putting him through strenuous military style-martial arts training and exposing him to everything which Chris has difficulties coping with.Tough and at times flawed fatherly love but gives results and Christian becomes independent, self-sufficient man. He decides to put in good use his extraordinary capabilities in math and begins to work as forensic accountant for some of the scariest people on earth - cartel, mafia bosses, e.t.c. The big money he earns, he donates to support Harbor Neuroscience Institute in New Hampshire, research facility dedicated to Autism. How he gets out alive from working for his criminal clientele and how he escapes CIA hunt for him, I won't give away. You will see in the film. A subtle and poignant romantic subplot is expertly interwoven in the plot. When Chris is hired by Living Robotics corporation to audit their books, he falls for Dana Cummings, in-house accountant who has discovered suspicious financial discrepancies. Chris quickly finds that substantial amount of funds is missing due to embezzlement. From that point an impressive body count begins, which leads to the climax with triumphant showdown. There is a scene in this subplot that is profoundly moving and memorable. While Dana is sleeping, Chris writes a little card to say good bye to her. He longs for her love, but the words of his dad echo in his mind: ""Sooner or later ""different"" scares people. You are different."" Chris shuts the door slowly and the image of Dana segue in black as his dream is shuttered by reality!Ben Affleck is tremendous as the autistic Christian. He builds his character to perfection. Anna Kendrick is lovely as Dana and child- actor Seth Lee, who plays young Chris is a nice surprise.The soundtrack is mesmerizing. I can listen to it all day long and will not get bored for a second.The Accountant is simply superb film and I recommend it without hesitation."

Trust me, it's very entertaining, nothing wrong with it at all, as long as you leave your suspension of disbelief at the door. Yes, it's preposterous, but who cares? Affleck is believable both as an autistic man and as an assassin. The action sequences are great and the little details more than make up for the plot holes.Credit has to go to the director for elevating way above a lot of similar genre films. Before watching I had no idea it was the guy who also directed the exception Warrior. Proof he can take an idea that shouldn't work and make it human and real.

If Christian was sensitive to light and sound, he needed more light and sound. The world was not going to accommodate him. He and his brother Braxton received training in self-protection and other skills so that they could make their way in the world.Treasury department director, Ray Kinghas (J.K. Simmons) calls in Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), an efficiency expert with the department who has a police record she lied about. He blackmails her into locating this accountant and shows her pictures of him meeting with all sorts of mob bosses. He is retiring soon and he wants the man's identity known before he leaves.When a young woman, Dana (Anna Kendrick) at the company Living Robotics finds a $61 million discrepancy in the books, Christian is hired to do an audit by the Blackburns (John Lithgow and Jean Smart), who are brother and sister.The audit is soon called off after the financial director is murdered and it's made to look like a suicide. Dana and Christian are hunted by hit men.Medina finally learns Christian's identity and she and Ray are soon on his trail.This is an excellent film with a couple of very neat twists you won't see coming. The film goes from flashbacks of Christian's turbulent childhood and other events and then back to the present. The director, Gavin O'Connor, does an excellent job of pulling it all together.Ben Affleck isn't my favorite actor, though he is certainly a smart man and talented in other directions. He does a good job here - it's a role that requires no emotion, and while I think he's capable of more than that, he handles it well. Plus there's always something likable about him.Some wonderful actors in this cast: John Lithgow, Jean Smart, Cynthia Addai- Robinson, Anna Kendrick, and of course, J.K. Simmons - you really can't miss.Highly recommended - intriguing, sometimes scary, sometimes exciting, and surprising."
" Exposition Overload Confounds a Good Try at Something Different

It Tries to be Different and for the First Half Succeeds in taking the Audience to New Places and as the Puzzle Pieces Fall into Place the Film Falls Apart.The Third Act is so Crammed with Verbal Exposition and ""Oh come on!"" Contrivances that even the Non-Neuro-Challenged could Convulse and Scream Uncontrollably.Ben Affleck, in what could be Called ""Zombie-Superhero"" Mode is OK and the Supporting Cast Walk Through the Thing trying not to Trip on all the Motivations, Explanations, and Flashbacks, but the Plot is Overwritten to a Fault and that Drags Down the Better Aspects of this Good Try at Something Off-Beat.It's too Complicated for its Britches and would have been Better Off Staying where it Belonged and Forget all the Subplots and Superfluous Surroundings. It Works just Fine when it gets Personal about Personality Disorders and when it gets Visceral with its Violence.All that Other Stuff is too Confusing for those among us with Average Abilities, Skills, and Coping Methods.

" Engaging n entertaining drama/thriller. Ben Affleck's best performance.
",0.8591,0.9701,2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"When it released in theatre i dismissed it thinking it might be another dull movie on an accountant. I thot another Bourne rip off or shaky cam stuff. Boy i was so wrong. This movie is a very good drama/thriller. Saw this recently on a rented DVD. Affleck stars as The Accountant who has some dark secrets and illegal dealings. He had a rough childhood as an autistic kid who was raised by his army dad who made sure that his kids learn military training n Indonesian martial arts so that they r not exploited. Affleck credibly adopted the traits, behaviors and symptoms of autism. His performance was very good. The movie starts slowly but its not boring. There is sufficient character development n the story has good amount of twists n turns. There are several intersecting story lines in this film and one branch of that is the federal department tracking The Accountant. There is ample amount of action, both gun firing n hand to hand combat. The headshots r brutal, the body count is high n the movie ended well leaving room for a much needed sequel. But it is not ur typical action like John wick or The Equalizer. Thankfully it is not shot in hand held camera a la Jason bourne n Taken style jus to make it appear fast paced. The movie is engaging n entertaining. The suspense n tension is maintained throughout. Director O'Connor succeeded in normalising autism and showing that behavioural conditions should not get in the way of anyone's life."
" a good drama /triller/ action movie
",0.4404,0.9823,2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"i enjoyed watching this movie, the script it's original, the movie it's well directed the cast works very well. Ben Affleck gave a very convincing proof tho be a good actor. What convincing more about this movie it's the script that as i said it's fresh convincing and not preventable. The movie itself works with not too much imperfection , maybe the action scenes where Ben Afflesh seems more then a terminator are a bit too much, they remind me John wick but this movie wanted to be something different than just an action movie like shot them up. the storytelling it's really well done and editing to so everything flow in an easy way. Don't want to say too much because i don't want to spoiler at hall the story and the development but i really say you can enjoy this movie that it's a good mix between drama thriller and action"

Idea that people with disorders, people who are most of the time can not fit into our ""normal"" society can have their own way of getting their disorders turned into advantages and ways to overcome normality and become even greater was just heart warming."

One of my favourite aspects of The Accountant was his marksmanship with the badass .50cal M82 Barrett Sniper rifle. All the scenes with that were absolutely epic! Overall, The Accountant was very enjoyable to watch and that's what matters!"
" In arrears
",0.0,0.9778,2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Ben Affleck plays an unusual forensic accountant who can take apart a company's books to find problems with the finances.Unfortunately the script of ""The Accountant"" needed something similar. It starts well, but by about half way through I felt the books were being cooked.Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has high functioning autism, which in ""The Accountant"" is not a liability, but instead gives him almost superhuman powers.In fact, as it unfolds and drifts more and more into implausibility, ""The Accountant"" feels like those films based on graphic novels. The action sequences are well-staged, but seem to go on for one karate blow and one burst of gunfire too many.The most fascinating aspects of the story are actually the investigative elements. One strand is where Christian uses his accounting skills to find where embezzlement has taken place at Living Robotics, the company run by Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow). The other is the investigation by the Treasury Department led by Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) ‚Äì reminiscent of Carl Hanratty from Spielberg's ""Catch Me if You Can"".But the story has another strand; a hit-man scenario seemingly inspired by the real life Richard Kuklinski (The Iceman).The most appealing characters in the story are the two women; Dana Cummings played by Anna Kendrick who is attracted to Affleck's character, and Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) who is trapped by Raymond King into pursuing the treasury investigation.I'm not sure if the film sheds a helpful light on autism, but there just seems to be too much story. Although the final revelations are complex and give some closure, they also seem a little too pat.I can see why the film received mixed reviews from the critics; my feelings about it are mixed as well. Although ""The Accountant"" seemed cashed-up at the beginning, by the end I think we were definitely short-changed."
" Original and Above Average Action Film
",0.3182,0.9659,2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an efficient accountant that is usually hired to find financial deceptions and embezzlement for criminal organizations. His point of contact is a woman's voice by phone and the means of payment are sometimes valuable paintings or gold bars instead of money. Christian was an autistic child that received a rigid military training with his brother Braxton from their paranoid military father. The director of the Treasure Department Raymond ""Ray"" King (J.K. Simmons) has been unsuccessfully hunting The Accountant for a long period and he blackmails the efficient analyst Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to identify who he is before his retirement. When the accountant Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) finds an embezzlement of 61 million-dollars in the Living Robotics, Christian is hired to audit the company by the owner Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow) and his sister Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart). The financial director Ed Chilton (Andy Umberger) tells that Dana committed a mistake but soon Christian checks the books and confirms the embezzlement. During the night, Chilton is murdered as if he had committed suicide and Lamar finishes the audit affecting Christian that have not finished his work. Soon Dana and he are hunted down by hit men and Christian protects her. Meanwhile Median finds his true identity and Christian is hunted by Ray and the FBI. Who might be the person behind the embezzlement? ""The Accountant"" is an original and above average action film. The cast has great performances; the screenplay using flashbacks is intriguing since the very beginning and the plot point in the end is a great surprise to the audiences. The ratings indicates that viewers usually like this film that has elements for a good franchise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Contador"" (""The Accountant"")"
" Excellent

Well written script and good acting by all. Nice use of flashbacks for character development. Many twists and turns and a bit of a surprise ending. Watch it! You won't be disappointed.

We get a rare insight and angle to Asperger's Syndrome or ""AUTISM"" as many know it"
" One unique action movie with a great story line and some classy acting
",0.7906,0.9455,2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,It's not that often a great story gets translated into a classy script and then benefits from top level acting. Thankfully this film manages to do all that and more. The unique story line combined with some excellent acting and action scenes is a triumph and is not just for those who crave some realistic looking action. Ben Affleck does a great job and makes the unusually talented and afflicted 'Accountant' believable. After this performance Ben Affleck must surely be at the top of the list to play '007'.
" A Great Script, An Iconic Performance
",0.6249,0.9912,2017-02-24 00:00:00,9,"This film is so good I hope it is just the first in a series. First of all, the script is excellent. The story is intelligent, complex, interesting, engaging, and surprising. The main character--the one I would like to see return in a sequel--is Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck), a nondescript, socially-backward accountant who is not what he seems.That is one of the themes of this film, that things are often not what they seem or incongruous.I think the film is best understood as a superhero story, complete with origins story. Our hero has no supernatural powers, he just relies on his impressive abilities, like Batman or Jack Reacher or Leon in ""The Professional"".Though Ben Affleck's performance dominates the film, the entire cast is strong, including Anna Kendrick (as the woman who tries to pierce his veil of anonymity), J.K. Simmons, Jeffrey Tambor, John Lithgow and Jean Smart."

Even Affleck himself gave a great performance; in order to pull this off had to make an autistic man seem human, caring, relatable and even sympathetic...something he did with subtle expression and timing. I wasn't expecting a lot maybe.. but I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I gave it a 9 because I can't think of a way to have really made it a better story or gain a better performance out of the players. It was entertaining and that is all I really see movies for... good entertainment."
" Not your normal accountant
",0.0,-0.8409,2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"The beginning of the movie is somewhat confusing. You hear some dialogue and noise but there's no image. It's done on purpose. It would be explained later. Actually if you ignore this part, the movie would work just fine.The movie is about an accountant (played by Ben Affleck), who normally work for the mobs, decided to take on a normal accounting job from a normal-looking business. The business is trying to find million dollars of discrepancy. When the accountant got close to finding the cause, one of the business owner was murdered, and he was fired.But this account is mental. He doesn't like to quit and on his own tried to figure out what is going on. Before long he found he is being targeted by professional assassins. And what do you know, his dad happened to have trained him in combats and weaponry, so the rest of the movie is about how he deals with the assassins and how he figures out why he was being targeted.Oh yeah, there is a female co-star. She's the accountant of the business that hired The accountant. Apparently she is not able to figure out the accounting discrepancy. This role is non-essential. If they deleted her from this movie, the movie would pretty much remain the same. But it is nice to have a female co-star, a damsel in distress for the leading man to rescue."
" Body Count
",0.0,0.9711,2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I love a good thriller, action film, mystery or any combination of the three. When you can not only join those three together but add a new twist to it, something not done before, it makes it even better. So it is that I can't recommend the movie THE ACCOUNTANT enough.Ben Affleck plays Christian Wolff, a high level autistic man with an incredible ability to work with numbers. But he's more than that. Christian also has the skills of a master assassin. Those skills are put to use but not in the way you would think.The film moves back and forth in time, showing Christian as a young boy learning to deal with the autism that is a daily part of his life and then as adult Affleck. That's the real twist here, the story of a man with what many would consider a disability who puts it to use for good in the strangest way. Christian works for numerous illegal enterprises handling their books. In return he makes plenty of money as well as being paid in various items. It also gives him access to people in need of help.As the film progresses we discover that the Treasury Department is searching for Christian, not by name but as the Accountant. He's been spotted in the background of those illegal goings on, been named and now they're targeting him. Special agent Ray King brings in Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to lay the groundwork and do the investigating. He's found out about her checkered past and uses that to force her into doing this for him. In return he'll help her career and ignore her history.Christian is hired by a robotics company to delve into their books, trying to find discrepancies that were noted totaling into the millions. He is aided by a young bookkeeper at the company, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick). He finds the problem but before he can dig deep enough to find out who is responsible he's taken off the job at full pay. Due to his autism this digs at him and his compulsion to complete any job given to him.But then people start dying, none of natural causes. Soon Christian realizes that his life is in danger as is that of Dana since she helped when she could. Now both are on the run from the killers while trying to figure out who is behind it all. As they do so Dana begins to discover that Christian isn't the mild mannered accountant that she thought at first.This may seem like giving a lot of information about the movie but in truth it is the bare basics. As much could be learned by paying attention to the trailer for the film. But the combination of writing, directing, acting and more make for a riveting thriller that holds you captive until the credits begin to roll. Everyone involved here have come together to make a movie that I for one will want to watch more than once.Affleck does an amazing job as Christian displaying his abilities as an actor when it comes to showing the autistic side of his character and then switching up to the action sequences smoothly showing the other side of the character. Kendrick does a fine job but isn't given much to do here. Simmons turns in his usual well done performance but offers a few surprises of his own. And Addai-Robinson, a new face to me, shows that she has what it takes to get more featured rolls.At the heart of it all is the story that captivates the viewer. It takes a topic that is usually reserved for disease-of-the-week status and inserts it into something completely different. Then it twists and turns the story around that basic concept and makes it something unique. For me this movie was one that held me in its grip from start to finish and caught me off guard as well. That's rare these days and make this a movie that I can't recommend highly enough."

Simmons and Anna kendrick.Affleck's performance here's one of his best next to his amazing role in Gone Girl 2014 (which i highly recommend you to watch), he really brought to the character everything and show to us how people with autism live.the action scenes are the soul of the film, i enjoyed them very much especially ben's head shots they were very funny and enjoyable and his fighting skills were really amazing( i just which they had put a little more action to this film, but i guess due to the flashback scenes and the difficult story it would have become too difficult to focus.As for the brother role it was OK in the flash back but when it came to present time it was a little bit bad and the reason of it is choosing an actor who is totally different in race and physic and i just kept looking at him wondering what the hell they were thinking when they chose him to play the role (even his body figure was totally different from the child's body!) for me that was the only bad thing in this film.Final rate :8 out of 10"
" Ben Affleck Stars In Some Pretty Good Films!
",0.75,0.9784,2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Ben Affleck stars in some pretty good films and ""The Accountant"" was no exception. ""The ""Accountant"" was actually everything I expected it to be and with the little plot twist, a little more. This film was brilliantly written which gave it a great story-line and plot that easily kept the viewer interested without going over board with everything. The acting in this film was great. With Ben Affleck, J.K. Simmons, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, and Anna Kendrick making up some of the cast of this film, it called for some pretty good acting. In a film like this one action, along with a good story-line, is pretty much what drives the film and ""The Accountant"" had a decent amount of it, not as much as I hoped it would have but just enough to make me happy. If you're into crime dramas I would definitely recommend this one."

" it's got the cast, it's got the director, not so much the script
",0.0,0.9978,2017-02-15 00:00:00,6,"The Accountant, featuring Ben Affleck in one of his most interesting performances (whether that should translate as ""best"" is hard to say, he still has a lot of years left in him as a performer), is an autistic man who got trained as a boy by his father (along with his brother) to overcome his ""disability"", as the old man saw it (ex-military, duh), to become a take-no-prisoners-I-will-kill-you badass killer. Except that the autism doesn't go away just because of the extra killer-training, so he spends his time when he's not ""cooking"" the books for drug cartels and mobsters and even some terrorists (maybe) working as a mild-mannered CPA (emphasis on mild, sometimes people in front of him can't hear him he talks so softly). All should be well and good, but while he is having to deal with an account that goes bad - a little in the vein of John Wick, I suppose, someone who doesn't give two f***s thinks they can mess with/kill this 'Christian Wolff' (not his real name) - he also has to deal with conventional screen writing.Okay, that last part is me trying to be too clever in this review, but this is a movie where clearly the hook (or the logline) is amazing: what if someone like a Jason Bourne or a Wick or somebody, a man who comes on the scene, shoots people in the head, and has not an exactly friendly/James Bondian personality, and was fully on the ""spectrum""; from childhood this character got traumatized by his militaristic father (and where was the brother? Um, sort of spoiler, but here's a hint: as an adutl his name is on the poster). This, along with the script getting on the Blacklist, sold the concept to Hollywood, though I think the script still needed some work. It's a film that is juggling a lot of balls and may be too long because of it; while JK Simmons is a national treasure among character actors, his role in this film, though with some gravitas and (occasionally) some surprising emotion, is there mostly as a 2nd-turning point exposition dump, with information that would've been helpful to another character (also given a kind of 'you must do this or else' mission that makes little sense, in the circumstances I mean, it never comes back to it).In other words, this sub-plot, which seems to be necessary for some reason, is there mostly to provide us with a man-hunt element for Christian Wolff that isn't necessary. There's enough story there with Wolff and the plastic-cyborg boss (John Lithgow), and Anna Kendrick as the fellow accountant who is probably the closest to an audience surrogate (Affleck is our 'hero', but is such a blank canvas at some points and other times such a wounded creature that it's hard to put ourselves in his position, aside from empathizing with overcoming pain of course if one's had it). It's as if there's a more compelling drama about the breakdown of a family and the trauma that's brought on by it, mostly seen in flashback, and then the main storyline with Affleck trying to protect Kendrick, while engaging, is not something we necessarily haven't seen before.The only truly original element when it comes down to it is the autism, and to the filmmakers' credit it is handled with both sensitivity and even a playful sense of humor. Affleck and the writer do understand that there can be, in the right context, some awkward humor to mine from a character that not so much can't relate to people like the one Kendrick plays but is not using the words one usually does in the social contract. And Affleck is doing so little here, but that makes for a striking change of pace - he isn't having to do the overly AFFLECK acting that sometimes tripped him up when he was younger (sometimes it worked well, like Hollywoodland, other times not). Here he wipes his emotional radar clean and the audience can put themselves on to him, up to a point, and then when there is the hesitation, those little cracks, it resonates.It's like the movie has the ingredients for a strong director, with O'Connor getting how to make a hit-man (or hit men with Bernthal) move quickly with action that is intense and intelligible, yet also pace it so we can spend time with the characters, and the cast is pretty much on point (also Addai-Robinson, *TV's* Amanda Waller, is good as well, for what she can do), and the script is hit or miss. There are a lot of excellent scenes here, little moments that stick out (notice Dana's reactions to Christian's paintings), but there's a lot of silliness and things that we have to buy that don't quite gell; it even leans into the superhero territory of a comic-book movie as far as just how precise Christian can get. And near the end, there's one twist too many - one of them I could actually buy, sort of, and then there's one final one that is flat-out unconscionable.So it's good. But it's also unfocused and a little too proud of itself, nearly self-importance. It pulls back enough to be entertaining, but its mixed up as far as giving us too much backstory way too late, like it either needed to be a half hour longer or 20 minutes shorter, if that makes sense."
" Very well done
",0.3384,0.0173,2017-02-15 00:00:00,9,"Im not a huge fan of Ben Affleck or new movies typically, but once it a while they all come together in such a manner that leaves me satisfied after the show ends. This would be one of those movies, it has well done plot, several twists, the story is well played out and Affleck's character proves to be very believable as many people I know suffer from his same condition(s) and they act in the very same manner. He (Christian) could very well be a person functioning in society at this very minute. The story is filled with lots of action but not to a manner that its overdone or that hes superhuman as typically seen in other movies such as the Bourne series. There's no huge gore factor, major death scenes, sex or nudity either. The action is fairly realistic and the way he just waives and walks off was humorous and emphasized his characters condition as if nothing had happened. I suggest watching this movie, it ended not how I thought it would and didn't leave you hanging in thin air for a second movie to be continued later on."
" Rainman That Handles Guns
",0.0,0.962,2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"The Accountant was one of those rare movies that delivered on its promise--if we can consider the trailer the promise. I was expecting a clever assassin film and that's what it is.John Wolff (Ben Affleck) is a high-functioning autistic individual that chose accounting as a career path--but he's no ordinary accountant. He chose a more lucrative, albeit more dangerous, life of accounting for well-known criminals. Throughout the movie there is exposition given in the form of dreams or reverie so as to inform the viewer as to how John became the person he is (i.e. how he got into accounting for super-criminals and how he became a badass). The drama comes when John takes an accounting gig for a legitimate business.The movie offers a lot of backstory and even side stories. There is some mystery and misdirection. Nothing was real jaw-dropping but they didn't try too hard to set the viewers up for a big reveal either. I think the oddest and probably most detracting part of the movie was the love-interest/chivalrous element. Almost as if to force the action they introduced a female character, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), as the odd and highly annoying ""love"" interest. I'm using the term ""love interest"" loosely; she was the damsel in distress hence the default love interest.Barring that trope, the movie was really good. It was a progress step for autism (I guess) and a new way to show autistic people in a light other than that of a Rainman."

The story of a freelance accountant who was hired by a company to find the financial frauds. But when he's on the verge to uncover the names, the company rolls back over one of its member's death in the following day. It does not stop there, the life threat tails him and all who were involved with him. Now the film reveals his real identity going back to disclose his childhood days, like how he grew up. In the meantime, he has to find those people who are after him before they do and so with a twist the film comes to an end.Coming from a DC film, now Ben Affleck proved he can be like any other top actors from the industry. His physique was great for the role he played. Thanks to Batman role. This is like his version of 'John Wick' or 'Jack Reacher'. Definitely we can expect a sequel here. Anna Kedrick was great in the recent time with all her films, particularly the box office wise. In this she did not get bigger role, but one of the main and in the follow-up, she might get more opportunity. The film was almost perfect for a crime-thriller. Especially the characters make the film finest of its kind. An outstanding film, so recommended for those who seek entertainment fullest.9/10"
" Rather disappointing i am afraid...
",-0.4939,0.8951,2017-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Having heard good things about this movie i happily went to see it thinking that after a rather long time i was again and at last up to watching a promising thriller. Perhaps this is the reason of my disappointment since this is not a bad movie especially for a non demanding viewer. Yet i am afraid that for the ones who insist on expecting something really new and genuine when in front of a movie screen, this film won't fulfill their expectations. The accountant does not at all deviate from the normal clich√©s Hollywood embeds in almost all its productions: The ""good guy"" who proves to be even better in the end is there, the bad guys are there, the childhood traumas are there, the love story is there, the ""unexpected'-yet so terribly predictable- wannabe twist (the lost brothers/opponents...reunion) is there, babbling scenes of film characters chattering about their own life dramas are there, and of course a happy ending is there as well. The ones who are really very much familiar with all these clich√©s - actually it's very much for them many Hollywood films are so far-fetched - may just oversee them and are welcome to accuse me of fabricating them, yet not being bothered by clich√©s and stereotypes is one thing, pointing them out is another. After all i am not the one who denies ""fiction"" elements in films, what i find annoying is their overdose."

I enjoyed the whole 2 hours of this movie till the very end though the ending where he met his brother was bit clich√© but and I think it should have a sequel or at least a TV series like the new Dare Devil on Netflix.

To me, anytime that long of a scene is used to explain the first hour of what you've already scene, is a clear indication that the writers are lazy in their writing.Next, the climax of the film is so damn ridiculous, and stupid, you will want to put a bullet thru your television. It involves two brothers who haven't seen each other for 10 years.JK Simmons and Anna Kendrick are wasted. The most moving part of Ben Affleck's performance is his hairpiece.Save yourself the time and the money, and avoid this movie.4 out of 10"
" Great action movie, great message!
",0.8588,0.9857,2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"With ""The Accountant"" we have the opportunity to attend not only to a good and intense action movie but also the life of someone who learns to deal with neurological limitations, a person who, on first view, couldn't ever lead a successful career. Instead, Mr. Wolff (Ben Affleck) manages to surpass himself and starts using his skills on a peculiar way leading a life quite radical and even eccentric. I also appreciated very much the leaps in time during the film that helps to understand all the factors that will construct the current personality of the protagonist character, how his father educates him and his brother in a violent mode. I've to talk about all the routine scenes too, typical of autism, in which we perceive the trend of a methodological person with Asperger Syndrome. Apart from this, and not to be exploring the story of Mr.Wolff in a spoiler way, I emphasize that I really loved the introduction of the characters of Treasure in the story, agent Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) and the department head Ray King (J.K. Simons), both characters with a central role in the story. Congratulations to Anna Kendrick and Jon Bernthal by their fantastic plays too. Nothing more to say, great rate for this movie I advise anyone who enjoys a good action movie to watch ""the Accountant""!"

This movie takes the premise that the father of the protagonist uses his military expertise to guide his son to adulthood by training him in extreme forms of violence. No surprise that the son, a math genius brilliantly portrayed by Ben Affleck, becomes a killer as well as an accountant.Plot twists galore, fine acting on the part of the entire cast, make this a fascinating movie which I highly recommend.Ben Affleck should have received a Best Actor nomination.The only reason I did not give this movie a ""10"" was because the editing could have been better at times. Even re-watching certain scenes (thank goodness for DVD!) did not clarify ""What just happened?"" or ""Why did he do that?"" Although many questions were answered by the end of the film, some of the ""What just happened?"" and ""Why did he do that?"" questions were still unresolved."
" The story of a mathematician sans logic doesn't quite equate, but the entertainment factor as the variable solves that puzzle.
",0.7469,0.8467,2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"A rather pleasant throwback to the escapist action movies of the '90s that should be watched for pure popcorn entertainment but falls apart if you try scrutinizing its logic. I sometimes wonder how Ben Affleck chooses his movies as an actor especially after he started part- timing behind the camera. Apart from 'Gone Girl' which is rather similar to his choice of movies as a director, rest seem to just make money for him to produce his next venture. Doesn't sound like a bad idea at all!!Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) suffers from high-functioning autism but a gifted mathematician who takes up high profile jobs across the world from terrorists, failed states, mafia, cartels etc. to process their accounts. He also maintains a very low profile when he is back home in a small accounting firm as his front. When he takes up a new normal client which is a robotics conglomerate to uncook their books, his discovery leads to putting him as well as the young accounting executive of the firm Dana (Anna Kendrick) who initially identified the discrepancy in danger. All the while the US Treasury Department comprising of Ray King (J.K. Simmons) and Medina (Cynthia Robinson) are closing in on identifying him from his past deals. Can he put himself and Dana out of harm's way and identify who is behind targeting them?Ben Affleck gives a somber performance which is apt and fits the role perfectly that doesn't require him to emote beyond his poker face. Anna Kendrick doesn't enjoy a meaty role here and she is just for a distraction. The best part of the movie are its screenplay and editing which brings together different threads of the story in the most entertaining way possible. When I said that it is one of those many movies which would fall apart with a little scrutiny on logic, this one rather has way too many holes to ignore and at times they are too glaring. The big climax revelation can be guessed from far away but it does end up entertaining. The writers seems to be suffering from the same condition as that of its title character to obsessively cover all the loose ends to bring a logical conclusion and that leads to unnecessary footage which hampers the experience. Especially the story behind the robotic voice he keeps hearing throughout the movie. Despite its runtime the movie is rather breezy and doesn't feel dragged at any point. Another best part was the director's ability to capture some genuinely good moments which makes you forgive some logical misgivings. The story of a mathematician sans logic doesn't quite equate, but the entertainment factor as the variable solves that puzzle."

The subplot of the movie is what threw me off. I thought the secondary plot was a bit messy but yet still engaging.The acting in this movie was excellent. I think Ben Affleck as Christan Wolff is the best character he's ever played after Batman . Affleck's performance is both engaging and mesmerizing. Everyone does their job here, but Affleck steals the show.The violence feels ultra realistic. I love action movies, but none have felt as real as this in a long time. When The Accountant kills people, he kills people, and it's not pretty.There's a lot of jump cutting that's present here.

'The Accountant' is just as bland and unimaginative as the title suggests - an instantly forgettable and bang average film.The film is 2 hours long and it takes half that for any sort of plot to emerge. The excitement and suspense is disappointingly low for a so- called action thriller film, not helped by a frankly boring and wooden acting performance by Ben Affleck, who doesn't change his facial expression in the entire duration of the film.One thing is for sure, if there's a film that comes out titled 'The Economist', I'll take it as a hint that I should avoid it all together, like I should have done with this one."

We were hoping for something greater than just an Affleck led action/suspense movie, and we were not disappointed at all.Of course there is a good deal of action and violence, but where this movie really shines is within the background stories of the most involved characters.To make characters endearing the movie must make you feel a believable emotion to create the desired affinity. Without going into any spoilers, I can say that this movie made a very consistent effort to tie all roles and values together, in a logical fashion. The reasons behind all actions within the movie were complemented heavily by little sub plots running at the same time. Everything was tied together very well, and the characters were found to be very likable by the end.The movie definitely touches on some sensitive real life issues, and provides an open minded view which can be thought provoking for some.All in all, this movie exceeded my expectations in many ways."
" Would feel frustratingly over-stuffed were it not so utterly preposterous
",-0.4588,-0.932,2017-01-27 00:00:00,6,"Audiences are obsessed with superheroes these days. Perhaps it's down to these caped crusaders offering a more straightforward answer to crime and corruption or the genre's lack of grey morals in our increasingly confusing world, but it's nearly impossible to avoid coming across a meta-human of some description in the multiplexes. While he may not have been bitten by a radioactive spider or possess the mutant gene, Ben Affleck's Christian Wolff is every inch a superhero. His power, as he describes it, is high-functioning autism, which means that he makes sure everything in view is at its proper angle before tucking into a meal, and tends to freak out when he doesn't see something through to the very end. Oh, and he's also a master of hand-to-hand combat and owns an arsenal of weapons so ridiculously huge that even Chuck Norris would blush at the sight of it.Gavin O'Connor's The Accountant begins by introducing us to Wolff, who at first appears to live a low-key life for a small-town accountancy firm, eating dinner alone every night in what is clearly a strict routine. He's also a mathematical genius, using his skills as a mental calculator to cook the books for some of the world's wealthiest and most dangerous criminal organisations. His latest job is to audit the books of expanding corporation Living Robotics, whose low-level employee Dana (Anna Kendrick) has found numerous discrepancies when conducting her own audit. Christian ignores Dana's months of work and finds the missing money overnight, turning the office windows into a huge equation (seemingly the go-to quirk for movie geniuses). The company's CEO Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow) decides it's case closed when the chief financial offers turns up dead the next day, apparently of a deliberate insulin overdose.There's also much more going on away from the central character. Ray King (J.K. Simmons), a director at the Treasury Department, knows of Christian's alias as the 'Accountant', and has pictures to prove his association with some incredibly powerful and scary men. He blackmails data analyst Marybeth (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) into assisting him after exposing her petty criminal past, with only the photos and a few known alias to work from. An unnervingly charming hit-man named Brax, whose motivations and true intentions are kept hazy at best, keeps popping up every now and then, and he is played marvellously by Jon Bernthal. There's also Christian's backstory to get through - the discovery of his 'disability', his strict military father who wants to toughen his son up so he can function in the real world, and his combat training. It's a hell of a lot to cram into 2 hours and 8 minutes, and this would be frustrating were in not for the distraction of the movie's willingness to take its character into such increasingly preposterous situations.To put you in the picture, Christian Wolff is the combination of two of Affleck's buddy Matt Damon's most iconic characters: Jason Bourne and Will Hunting - although Bourne was never so eager to shoot people in the face. It could certainly be argued that this is Affleck's fourth outing as a superhero (after Daredevil, Superman and Batman), and at times he may as well be donning the cowl as he effortlessly punches and blasts his way through hoards of bad guys. After all, it's been theorised that Bruce Wayne suffers from a form of autism. The action is incredible at times; a mixture of The Raid's Pencak silat and John Wick's hyper-stylised gun porn. Yet, 'entertaining' is all that The Accountant aspires to be, and any suggestions of a more studios portrayal of autism raised during the quieter and more humorous first half gives way to generic audience- pleasing. It survives on its tantalising and original premise and the strength of its lead's subtle performance, and I would certainly watch a follow-up."

On top of that, he's a wicked sharpshooter and hand-to-hand fighter, so he's basically a genius Jason Bourne.There were quite a few unconnected and unresolved plot threads, so the movie didn't feel too cohesive, but it was entertaining enough, and certain events towards the end almost made me tear up. Did not expect that. Some threads, though, are connected by the end and you finally understand everything.Some themes: the morality of killing, the ""proper"" way to raise a child, especially an autistic one.I do recommend if you're into action flicks with an unstoppable lead character.

" Solid Action; Solid Acting; Solid Direction - Worth a watch
",0.5719,0.9946,2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Overall: It's a solid action movie and one of the better Ben Affleck movies of 2016. It's worth a watch if you just want a good time.Good: Ben Affleck is just incredible in his role of Christian Wolff and his was portrayal of autism was very well done and not overly done and over bloated like it's displayed in movies these days. In addition to this, the character of Christian Wolff was very cool and interesting. You wanted to know about him. The premise is quite strange but works quite well in my opinion. The action scenes are excellent and very well choreographed. The cinematography was pretty darn good and the music was probably non-existent(I didn't notice any). There were a few scenes which made me laugh. I hope this was intentional so I don't go to hell but I laughed regardless. Easily one of Affleck's best movies of 2016.Bad: There is a moment in the movie where a minor character takes a 3-4 minute break to dump exposition on the audience so we knew what was going down in the finale. We needed to know this information but how it was handled felt very amateur and badly done. The story was pretty uninteresting and could have been written better. You have a pretty decent premise so all they had to do what use a little more imagination and give it a much better story. The 'twist' ending, which I shall not spoil, had little to no build up and didn't affect me at all. It was just there to 'spice' things up. The villains are boring and uninteresting and just plain generic. Also, up until the last 30 minutes, it was essentially just a dot-to-dot of events with no real method to them.Best Part: The siege on the villain's fortressMVP: Ben Affleck as Christian Wolff8/10"

The theme in the air was not obvious and it took a while to really understand that the biggest thing in this movie is family. Even that there was a lot of other things happening.Acting was phenomenal. J.K. Simmons once again left me speechless and i have to give a lot of credit to Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthall who had an amazing scene at this movie.The action scenes were great. They reminded me a lot of John Wick. Which is great, because that was a good movie. The characters had depth, the plot was great and there were some very good twists.

The only reason I don't give this a 10, was because Afleck doesn't quite cut it, in this role. Nonetheless, it was a good enough performance. I don't think too many actors out there in the right age range, could have pulled off this rather difficult role anyway. The acting was otherwise of the highest quality. The story was extremely well crafted. Calling attention to a medical condition, is the icing on the cake. It is somewhat convoluted, but comes together rather nicely. It even puts in some believable pathos as well. I highly recommend it for fans of good suspense, acting, as well as action."
" Ben Affleck, you da bomb in The Accountant YO!
",-0.5411,0.4487,2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"'The Accountant' is not just about someone who does people's taxes and saves people money? It's so much more than that with Gavin O'Connor's (Miracle, Warrior) film 'The Accountant', starring Ben Affleck or as we all know him now as 'Batman'. 'The Accountant' is a mix between Jason Bourne, Rain Man, and John Wick as we follow a man named Christian Wolff (if that's his real name?) who was diagnosed as a high-functioning autistic kid at a young age. He had an affinity for numbers and solving puzzles, and was super quick to do so. He might have just been a superhero from an early age.His father raised him to harness his abilities in unorthodox ways, such as teaching the young ""accountant"" kung-fu skills and how to shoot a number of guns. Instead of running off to Las Vegas to count cards, this kid grew up into Ben Affleck and is a legit account, but for a ton of drug cartels and super criminals around the world. No, he's not a bad guy, as he has a heart of gold, and will take out the bad guys one by one if they try and come after him with great ease.That's where we enter our story where John Lithgow hires Ben Affleck to look at the books for his robotic company and all hell breaks loose when people start ending up dead. Meanwhile, J.K. Simmons who works for the CIA wants to know who this ""accountant"" is and why he's hanging out with another timid accountant (Anna Kendrick). Bullets fly by at an incredible rate throughout the film and there is some excellent fight choreography that will make yo believe Ben Affleck is indeed that BADASS! I mean, there are certain scenes in this film where Affleck should have just worn the cape and cowl and been called Batman.On the other side, Affleck's character is awkward, shy, and monotone, but you can tell that the character desperately wants to fit in and be normal, which Affleck shows on screen in every scene. There are a ton of genuine and even funny moments with him and his ticks and it all plays out great. J.K. Simmons does a hell of a job here as someone who has a haunted past, as Anna Kendrick, Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Lithgow all turn in excellent performances.The film as a whole is fairly predictable, even though Gavin O'Connor tries to pull the sheets over our eyes, but if you were paying any sort of attention at the start of the film, you could tell where 'The Accountant' was going to tally up the sum (apologies). For a two hour action film, the stories, performance, and script all have a bit of depth and charm to put it above the rest and should really give the 'Bourne' franchise a run for its money. Come on, it's what we've always wanted. Affleck vs Damon in a steel cage match somewhere in Rome. Think of the possibilities.RECOMMENDED!"

" Silly, forgettable action flick
",0.0258,0.8769,2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"In ""The Accountant"", Ben Affleck, who is forever linked with his erstwhile partner Matt Damon, gets to play both of Damon's most famous roles: he is a mathematical genius (an autistic savant) like Will Hunting and a weapons expert, like Jason Bourne.The movie is not as memorable as the ones that feature those characters, however. It's shallow and predictable, with unnecessary bookends and a hard to follow plot. You don't need to follow the plot, though; the movie is a well-oiled machine, and I guess that's part of the problem. Nothing takes you by surprise, nothing jolts you. It's a good time waster, nothing more.That the movie attempts to be a statement on autism outside of its absurd thriller plot might be the only original stroke. But then, the fact that it's a statement that says nothing new or interesting - autistic people aren't stupid, just different - shows that it's just another play in the hack director/screenwriter's handbook. It's a ploy to make you think you've seen something more important than a lacklustre action movie."

If you make a good film, most people will like it, even if you don't specifically aim for them to like it.This film doesn't add gratuitous sex or gore to appear edgy. There's no chase scene. The action is there because it advances the story.Don't be deceived by its modest (but honest) rating (7.4) - the majority gave it an 8. Compare that to Batman v Superman (6.7), a film for one type of moviegoer, which ""earns"" its 6.7 rating through an impassioned young fanbase giving the film 10. The Accountant has fewer than 3000 votes in the 4, 3, 2 and 1 star buckets. Compare that with Batman v Superman's 56000. You read that right. 56 thousand giving it less than 5 stars.This film is basically the anti-action hero film. He is, in a way, a superhero that doesn't make a name for himself.

Doesn't have a butler or a fancy car. He drives a pickup truck. He is rich, but doesn't use the money. He is not this super good, super moral person. He works with criminals, cleaning dirty money, but he doesn't keep it for himself. It's not black and white with a good action hero in a spandex suit fighting someone called Dr. Evil who wants to poison the city's water supply for no good reason.At the end, he doesn't get the girl. He doesn't get the fame, the credit, or anything. He lives on the run. He gets nothing. He lives a sad and lonely life.

Christian offers his services to Living Robotics who claim to have lost $61-million. Christian with the help of another accountant, Dana (Anna Kendrick), discover how the money was lost, but not really lost, but just reinvested into other company accounts to make the business look more successful to attain more investors. Living Robotics now believe Christian and Dana have succeeded in discovering how the money was ""lost"" and now their lives are in danger. They hire The Assassin (Jon Bernthal) to take them out. Oh, oh!This is told via flashbacks to Christian's childhood with his autism and the present day with autistic ticks he tries to control. There are a lot of bits and pieces that seem unconnected, but stay with this because it will all make sense later on. The acting throughout is of the highest caliber and in some ways Christian Wolf will make you think of John Wick (the movie with Keanu Reeves) as he goes about killing bad guys. This is a thoughtful and very suspenseful story and Ben Affleck does, perhaps, the best job of his career ever. An Oscar? Hmmmm¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö possible.

",0.6597,-0.9794,2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"This thriller directed by 'Warrior' mastermind Gavin O'Connor is nothing particularly original, or at least entirely. But for a film boasting Ben Affleck in the lead role, it is an entertaining vehicle with a solid array of violent action set pieces and suspense. Calling this film an action film does feel slightly of an overstatement however, as it is a bit a slowburner with action sequences lightly sprinkled throughout it's 128-minute runtime. Thus, it is easier to categorize this movie as more of a thriller with action-heavy moments than a straight-up action flick. After all, the protagonist is no ordinary action hero highly trained with firearms and hand-to-hand combat, he's a man with highly skilled mathematical skills supplemented with a hefty hand on the gun trigger. Director Gavin O'Connor takes this ""Good Will Hunting meets Jason Bourne"" type hero and draws him into an intense battlefield of gunfights and corporate conspiracy, with Ben Affleck breathing life into the role. Affleck plays Christian Wolff, an autistic public accountant who's suffered from social anxiety as a child and domestic abuse from the hands of his father. He possesses an incredible set of math skills he puts to use for his everyday life. When he's not working, he is forming financial operations for a string of criminal organizations. This grabs the attention of the Treasury Department director Ray King (played by J.K Simmons) who goes on the hunt. When Christian dips further into the truth of these secret organizations, bullets starts flying and the life of his fellow accountant Dana Cumming (played by Anna Kendrick) is put in grave danger.Gavin O'Connor may not be a visionary but he at least knows how to keep things moving even for the parts that don't work. In this case, this film doesn't jump straight to hyper-kinetic action. Instead, Gavin O'Connor takes his precious time on fleshing out the characters including the lead character's autism which he greatly endured during his childhood. His backstory is freshly painted out in a series of sporadic flashbacks showing his tumultuous relationship with his hard-nosed father who often forced him and his brother to learn how to fight. It is around the halfway point when Ben Affleck's lead character begins unloading his guns on the baddies, and when it happens it is lot of fun. These sequences do not come very frequently as they serve more as tools to propel the plot, the biggest gem the film has to offer is the suspenseful atmosphere which is generated by the grimness of the plot. Characters are brutally murdered and Anna Kendrick's Dana Cumming is threatened by a group of assassins who take part in a suspicious criminal organization run by Jon Bernthal. Ben Affleck stands strong as the lead character, channeling his mental autism with authenticity rather than over-the-top. Anna Kendrick, J.K Simmons, and Jon Bernthal as well portray their character pretty solidly, although nothing special to speak of. Arguably the biggest shortcoming standing in the way of this film is the final twenty minutes when following a loud, climatic shootout sequence in the mansion. Concluding the story is a twist involving one of the main villains that may offer a little surprise but comes off rather underwhelming.The Accountant is a solid thrill ride with standard performances and a sleek hodgepodge of action, energy, and riveting suspense. Although this movie falls to underwhelming results in a few areas, Gavin O'Connor nicely makes up for these blemishes with a direction that mostly works. It is not a groundbreaking film for it's genre, but at least gets the job done."
" A good movie that works around Ben Affleck's acting ability
",0.6369,0.9913,2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I almost skipped this movie because it starred Ben Affleck. I have always been amazed that he can get so many rolls and is considered one of Hollywood's A list actors. In all of his movies, he is a non emotional, bland character that lacks even the most basic facial inflections. In this movie, they have made him a character that embraces all of his shortcomings-and it works. Casting him as an autistic adult allows him to make the role work. The fact that he is surrounded by some stellar actors and the good sense of the writers to not give him an overabundance of lines also works well.Now that I have bagged on one of my least favorite actors. I must say this was a pretty good movie and I was pleasantly surprised. There is some good acting, enough violence to satisfy all but the most action/violence addicted fans and a well written screenplay. There is actually a story line and some character development. As the movie progresses, there are some flashbacks to fill in the characters. Best of all, there is even a well written ending with a bit of a surprise twist.Pros. Good acting, good plot, good writing, good action and good ending.Cons. Ben Affleck - Sorry, this movie did not change my overall opinion of him. Still one-dimensional."

I found the movie a bit boring...At the end, the hero does not get hit and manages to kill everyone. He could've been sniped multiple times at moderate to close range while he was engaged in firefight with other forces. But no, no one happens to be there and shoot him while he is fighting hand to hand on with others on the ground with no firearms. And only after he recovers does anyone show up with a gun.

I was right. This may well be the last Hollywood movie I watch. It was hard to believe that each and every scene was not made to be intentionally funny. At one point, when I couldn't take it anymore I actually called out ""I cant believe I am still watching this!!"" All the acting was mailed in from 1989. Along with the terrible, ridiculous 'story' a martial arts trained, autistic accountant,.. comedy maybe, nothing more. The acting was so poor, you can almost imagine each facial expression being given as an instruction, ""Now go like this :)"" then ""Go like that :O"" - ""Then when you say this line - go like this :("" It was such an ego trip for Ben Affleck who was obviously trying to compete with Matt Damon as Jason Borne. Near superhuman moves,.. yawn,. so childish to watch grown mens egos so obviously spewed at you, yet some people obviously love this .. It was like watching Affleck pleasure himself in the mirror for two whole hours, yet to see a 7.5 average rating at the moment makes me wonder what I have in common with the self-congratulatory majority who applaud such superficial, shallow, and meaningless values. I hope I have the sense to never pay for another Hollywood piece of tripe like this again."
" Close but no cigar
",-0.4215,0.9652,2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"This movie had a lot of potential, an autistic accountant who knows how to kick some serious ass could have made for one heck of a ride.But it ends up falling a bit short and ends up just being decent.The first half moves on pretty slow but the biggest problem with it I found was the fact that even though Ben Affleck is the lead of the film, the focus is too often switched on other characters that have little to no significance to the plot but are there more or less to work as narrators in order to give us a bit of the puzzle pieces to figure out who he is.But could we not just have had more scenes with the man himself instead? I get that Affleck's character is a man of few words but there is multiple ways around that, plus Ryan Gosling in 'DRIVE (2011)' hardly had any lines in most scenes and that's a great film so it's definitely doable. And if they did that they could have dug into the depth of the character more.And although I normally like Anna Kendrick I felt like her quasi- relationship with Affleck was forced and overall it just doesn't come together as good as it could have had.So, all in all not terrible by any means but could have been so much better."

Plausible? Most probably (99.9%) not. But it's OK! This guy was as bad ass as it gets! Loved the action scenes, loved the plot and the flashbacks throughout the movie, loved it all! I even forgive the apparent plot twist which I suspected. I liked the fact that the director and writer kind of knitted together lots of the aspects of the movie. I liked all the small coincidences that kept everything together, and especially being a person that really believes that the world is a tiny tiny place, I also believed every single one of them. J.K. Simmons was nothing short than amazing as was Ben Affleck that really needed a good film like that I think. Anna Kendrick was mediocre and I really can't see why she's in so many movies lately. I would have liked for the movie to work a bit more on this part of Affleck's character though (women). Having said that, this is a movie that is best watched with the audio really loud, and with company. It's a wow movie in more than one moments. Nice one!"
" 'I have a highly functioning form of autism'
",0.0,-0.9325,2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"It is not often that using a mental impairment is used as the key behind a main character's actions, but writer Bill Dubuque and director Gavin O'Connor have teamed to show how adult sate autism can become a convincing key player in the creation of a highly controversial character about whom a complex film plot is based.In a back and forth manner the film looks at the childhood of Christian Wolff (Seth Lee as the youngster who will become Ben Affleck) and his little brother Brax (Jake Presley who will become Jon Bernthal) under the rather extraordinary aggressive abuse of their father (Robert C. Treveiler) who teaches his boys that 'Aggression, correctly channeled, overcomes a lot of flaws. Tapping into that aggression requires peeling back several layers of yourself.' Slipping into contemporary timeframe we discover that Christian Wolff (now Ben Affleck) is a math savant with more affinity for numbers than people. Behind the cover of a small-town CPA office, he works as a freelance accountant for some of the world's most dangerous criminal organizations. With the Treasury Department's Crime Enforcement Division, run by Ray King (J.K. Simmons), starting to close in, Christian takes on a legitimate client: a state-of-the-art robotics company where an accounting clerk (Anna Kendrick) has discovered a discrepancy involving millions of dollars. But as Christian uncooks the books and gets closer to the truth, it is the body count that starts to rise. And the film begins to dive into the kill feet that the trailer seemed to emphasize.Adding to the superb cast are character roles well performed by Jeffrey Tambor, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, John Lithgow, Jean Smart, Alison Wright and Andy Umberger.The violence is excessive but the concept of using autism as a starting point for the future of The Accountant makes sense in the manner in which it is managed. Not a film that lives up to its expectations, but a solid thriller with a fine cast nevertheless."
" The Accountant
",0.0,0.1764,2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"""The Accountant"" is a nicely told tale of Christian Wolff, an accountant by day, who ""cooks the books"" for some of the most dastardly people and organizations in the world. He is paid rather handsomely for his efforts; he owns an authentic Jackson Pollock work and (I think) a Renoir. He lives a rather unassuming life until he becomes aware the U. S. Department of Treasury may be on to him. His next ""client"" is a rather innocuous local robotics company. But as he discovers a massive fortune is unaccounted for (through his personal) audit, people begin to die.I thought Ben Affleck was simply amazing in this movie. He plays an autistic person. To be able to go through an entire movie and NEVER display any emotion regardless of your situation takes some acting chops. Anna Kendrick is also very likable as Dana Cummings, the innocent accounting worker at the robotics who accidentally discovered the missing monies.""The Accountant"" held my attention from beginning to end, which most movies have trouble doing. It tells a simply story and delivers it very well on-screen. There is also a major twist that smacked me up beside the head. Rated ""R"" for language and violence, check out ""The Accountant."""

And the best part, the same actor is playing both of them, so it's hard not to see the resemblance between the two stories.The main character is gifted in many ways and with a huge potential, set aside by society and lacking social skills, caught in his own reality and habits, fighting his own demons while being a guardian angel for others. A man with a mission to finish his job. I didn't see any trailer before seeing the movie so I was expecting a good movie (since everyone was recommending it), with a good story, but I was not expecting this. This movie has it all: action, drama, a good story, intrigue, all seasoned with a little humour, good acting and a good ending.

Oh, what's his name.. the guy from Walking Dead and who plays the Punisher in the Daredevil series is really starting to get on my nerves. He is the only thing I did not like about this movie and the only reason why I am giving this movie an eight out of ten stars instead of ten out of ten stars. The man is a one note actor who plays the same character over and over again. The character he plays does work in the confines of this particular film, in other words he isn't miscast or anything like that however, I am literally sick of watching him do his little dog and pony show for every single one of his roles."

It's not a coincidence that the cast includes terrific performers and great character actors; they all bite into these roles with juicy histories.Wolff played by the new Batman ""Ben Affleck"" in particular comes with all kinds of styles and stunts.

Simmons hire someone to find him when, once they found him they didn't do anything anyway, so what was the point?The movie just ended and didn't really tie up any loose ends, so I was really disappointed in the movie.But overall, I really liked the movie.

This is a movie I was looking forward to. I was expecting a tense assassin movie, but I was not 100% correct. The movie is very good and I recommend it, but it is also all over the place. It never really settles in on what it wants to be. Once it settles into a plot it changes and becomes about something else entirely. The movie ends up being a mix of many different movies.

Anyway, it is a long movie.The plot is a bit too convoluted to explain why and how all the main characters in the film, played well by very good actors, are connected to each other. But other than that it was pretty fun.Imagine that John Wick and Batman had a teleporter accident and you get the main character in the film. When a seemingly benign job turns sour he has to hurry to solve the issue. And since he is an accountant, he closes it. Well, it doesn't really make a lot of sense, as 80% of the scenes are all about Affleck kicking arse and about five minutes of actual accounting, but go with it.Bottom line: while well acted and executed, something was slightly off. I enjoyed the film, but there was never a ""Wow!"" moment (pardon the pun). I blame the overly contrived plot and probably the editing. Other than that, fun action movie."

Inconceivable!I thought I might like this, especially after all I heard, but I truly loved this 90's throwback/action flick that kinda reminded me of John Wick from another actor I used to hate: Keanu Reeves. Ben Affleck never impressed me as an actor, but lately, he's shined. Namely as the Dark Knight.It helps that he does, in fact, look like he walked off the set of Batman v. Superman to this. That might be a negative, normally for me, but it fit here. And I enjoyed the sh|t out of his action segments regardless of the background, insider knowledge.The Accountant tells the tale of said title who apparently helps out the baddies of the world to help his own inner issues/demons and shows some kind of anti-heroics.

" Doesn't add up

This is a ridiculously contrived movie starring Ben Affleck in the title role as a sort of Rainman meets Jason Bourne, sometime book-keeper to the mob, sometimes, out of the goodness of his heart, for ordinary hard- working folk too. Affleck's character, a maths savant who can fight like a ninja keeps a low profile, unless provoked when trust me, a small army couldn't stop him.On his trail are an ageing Federal Agent and his newly recruited young female forensic detective with the young whippersnapper, as you'd expect, finding sufficient clues out of airy nothing to track down Affleck. Affleck's difficult background is explained in extensive flashback scenes, his difficult childhood made tougher yet by his autistic condition, the strictures of his military background father and his always being considered an outcast by society. Also in the family mix is his younger brother and a young girl (a sister or cousin?), the latter of whose spasmodic fits render her incapable of speech.Although the plotting and structure of the story are confusing in the extreme, you can like me guess long in advance that three things are going to happen, firstly that John Lithgow isn't likely to be on the side of the angels, secondly that there's bound be a reckoning with his errant brother and lastly that all the fighting is going to be of the martial-arts variety. With them all go any semblance of credibility as the body-count mounts up higher than any Sly / Arnie / Bruce movie you can think of from the 80's.Ben Affleck carries across his bulked-up, inscrutable persona from his recent Batman role, Anna Kendrick is the geeky whistle-blower insider who befriends him and Jon Bernthal is the long-lost brother but none of them shine in this strange, highly contrived movie, with no single character warranting any sympathy never mind attention. When he returns to his compact, treasure-packed mobile-home after a hard day's work, Affleck's accountant gains relief from the stresses of the day by bizarrely listening to ten minutes of deafeningly loud thrash metal and hitting himself with a metal bar.

This movie coming from the modern era of United States with the new model system of banking, investment, and industries, so I guess that the movie idea highly probably inspired by true events. Based on the title, this movie is telling us about The Accountant story, but not that part of counting numbers in the boring seat. More of that, the plot is unpredictable until the end. But here I will not cover all. I just want to give review of the ideas and the characters. The idea of this movie is unique, intriguing, and fantastic. You will see Accountant job is really closed to the criminal world and finally law and order of the state related to Accounting things. Besides, this movie has highlight of military family dealing with their children with some health problems. I think Ben Affleck and Anne Kendrick are match each other. Ben Affleck has some kind of serious faces to handle as the main actor and Anne Kendrick has some awkward personalities to complete the plots. I do suggest to watch this movie to fill your time with your family, so that your family knows the values of money, morality, criminal mind, and finally ""family first"" quote is still valuable. Thank you."
" Better than expected
",0.4404,0.9886,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"When I went to watch the accountant I was prepared to watch an action film, no better than any other of its kind, simply blood gunshots and nothing deeper. Surprisingly in the movie where touched more than one social matters as the value of family, the importance of friends, how difference makes you a target, what the society thinks of autistic people and how we act like they are unwanted. My point is there was some sense there Ben Affleck rocked, he was at its best, still was Ben Affleck though, must admit not the best actor in the world but I never thought he could be that good, Also Anna Kentrick was at her best, she never was that special an actress but in this film she showed she has capabilities of becoming one. On the plot the characters were very well rounded, they could actually people, and the story line was fast enough not to be boring but slow enough not to be tiring. There was quite a lot of suspense that made you want to watch the film. Generally it was a film easy to watch that had a point and that was dark enough and bright enough, it gave much hope and happiness as well as sadness. The negative parts were that the movie was quite predictable at some points and the scenario wasn't very imaginative."
" Very Crowded But Not Bad
",0.5824,0.9861,2017-01-06 00:00:00,8,"The Accountant Hoped to do what hadn't been done, he tried to deal with more than one subject which the story line interfere with each other but not in an amusing way. If you felt a little bored in the movie it's your problem but it's the movie problem, Precisely it is the screenplay problem.Gavin O'Connor managed to take some amazing scenes for both Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal and I don't find any problems in his work except maybe in Lighting.Ben Affleck was really great and manged to perform in the Autism in the best way ever. Also Jon Bernthal was special as he always is with his spontaneous expressions.J.K. Simmons did a really nice scene which may be his best scene this year. Cynthia Addai-Robinson wasn't bad & Anna Kendrick was really bad.Give it a chance and live with Christian Wolff for a couple of hours and you will live a new experience about Autism which in my opinion was good but it could have been better My rating is 7.5/10. 2 points are lost because of Bill Dubuque (screenplay) as every mistake in the movie is his fault."
" Good Story Shitty actors
",-0.1779,-0.8862,2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"The GOOD:good story, smart conversations, good stunt & action, camera & effects are great, background music is good. The BAD:Ben Affleck struggles to suck his stomach all along the movie that he was unable to act properly. Ben Affleck acting is weak, Anna Kendrick does not have talent. Story is over crowded with middle eastern names of criminals to an extent that it feels lame & for those familiar with middle east it reveals that writer has not done enough research that he doesn t know the difference between Indians, Arabs, Pakistanis & Afghani's. My guess is that the writer;Bill Dubuque, and the director; Gavin O'Connor, are that stupid type who would probably call ALL Asians as Chinese. The UGLY:Anna Kendrick has no looks and no talent. She is just an uglier version of Barbara Streisand or Sarah Jessica Parker; (the horse-face)..she s another example of Hollywood labelling an ugly talent- less Shylock descent woman as being beautiful, insulting common taste. The same goes for talent-less Ben Affleck. Finally, if you want to vomit, looking and a talent-less & ugly person, look at Anna Kendrick in this movie. This movie could have been far more worthy if it was played by Leonardo Di Caprio who is insanely talented together with Olga Kurylenko who is both graceful & talented."
" Afflecks Bourne
",0.0,0.9599,2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"The Accountant was action packed, had some good twists and was fairly entertaining. I feel that this was Afflecks response to Bourne. It had a similar feel. I am not surprised considering the Damon/Affleck friendship. There were good plot twists in this film, although they were all pre-determinable. If you are looking for a good quick action based movie, this is probably a suitable fit. Affleck was solid, but do not expect him to accept an Oscar based on this performance. A solid film, and does what it's supposed to do. I appreciate a movie that is what it is however, akin to a roller coaster. Get in, strap in, raise your hands and enjoy the ride. But it is only a limited time."
" OK but it went overboard
",0.2421,0.2382,2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"If I was Ben Affleck and handed this script for the movie, I'd take it as it sounds like a good plot, however I'd refuse the part to play an Autistic person whose got super-human powers, an ace sniper shot, excellent heavy machine gun skills and a maths whiz because that's just gone over-board. They've practically made Ben Afflek untouchable, even worse than Jack Reacher because at least Jack Reacher gets a few hits to the face. This accountant has become something like the Equaliser, just out for revenge that can single-handedly take out a mafia. Why have the Directors not got any realism anymore in their scripts? I know this isn't a non-fiction movie but its becomes unbearable"
" Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
",0.0,0.9891,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"""As a math savant uncooks the books for a new client, the Treasury Department closes in on his activities and the body count starts to rise."" Now this is a movie we can definitely relate to. After all, Aspergers Syndrome and Autism is what Jay and Nick (The Autistic Reviewers) have, and my god...what a great performance Ben Affleck pulls off on acting as an autistic man! Christian Wolff is exactly how people with Autism behave. Not aware of other people's feelings, and always doing things their way instead of the ""human"" way or the ""right"" way. In the end what people struggle to realize in the end is that people with Autism always get the job done, but it has to be done their way, hence why they get fired, go from job to job etc.Ben Affleck's performance was way better than being in Pearl Harbour. Heck, he's better in this movie than he is at playing Batman. Anna Kendrick's performance is good. She wasn't playing the typical, over the top ""annoying"" girl...she was really serious in this one. J.K. Simmons was great, but with very little screen time. Would've been to see more of him. Haven't seen John Lithgow in a lot of movies these days, and he once again proves he is a good actor.The movie is predictable, but it moves along at a fast pace always keeping you intrigued or just enjoying the action and suspense. We highly recommend it. No Oscars for this movie, but it's still a great movie nonetheless. GO and see it or buy it. 4/5 stars- 8/10. Check us out on facebook- The Autistic Reviewers."
" a place beyond the pines....
",0.0,-0.2848,2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"wow...who expected this to be the outcome of the movie? There were portions of this movie that I didn't understand....mostly the tragic death during the mothers funeral..where Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthals dad gets killed? and there you have it...finding out that Ben Affleck and Jon bernthal were brothers was the big weird revelation. how entertaining or exciting was this movie? not very...cuz why are all the corporations closing business people getting killed? The story is interesting for a fanbase looking for something really really unrealistic...which too just more or less dumbfounds an audience. GONE BABY GONE in my opinion was like 100 times more entertaining, as was too the Departed...but the film did its job, blinding my eyes from the outside world for a few hours while in a theater seat."
" Too many O's in the title.
",0.0,-0.9516,2017-01-03 00:00:00,2,"In general, I tend to trust IMDb reviewers - but this is one movie where I think they have it spectacularly wrong.Much Like ""John Wicke"" (a travesty of a movie) this has a great concept - but it's let down by arguably some of the worst casting decisions in movie history; a terrible script; totally non-sensical situations; abysmally predictable resolutions and the growing trend in Horrorwood to try and be clever and avant garde - but fail miserably in the process (ref: Batman,Inception, James Bond etc). Contrasting the savant of Geoffrey Rush in ""Shine"", Hoffman in ""Rainman"" or DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" - leaves Ben Affleck with a long legacy of superb acting to live up to - and he simply does not make the effort. This left me instantly instantly let down by his poor attempt at conveying a precise and seasoned killer with high functioning Asperger's syndrome. It's a bit like watching Costner's Robin Hood - you know how Costner starts off for the first 3 mins trying to do an English accent - and then just simply abandons it to play Kevin Costner instead? Well that. That's what Affleck achieves here. What Ben Affleck does well in this movie is play Ben Affleck. That's about it.I cannot - cannot - fathom why on earth they do not cast Haley Bennett as the accounta-clerk-something-or-other who kicks the whole thing off - but one thing is for certain - if there was ANY doubt in anyone's mind that Anna Kendrick cannot act...like.at.all - this drivel must put paid to that debate. Her performance is utterly un-compelling - she comes across as a high school senior -a very, very annoying high school senior who got the part because daddy is in the industry or something (use your imagination here.) She does not present a convincing Anna Kendrick - let alone a convincing nerdy accountancy type. The Plot holes and inconsistencies are pretty much the only truly consistent thing about this movie - for example - and rather remarkably - despite conveying the concept that the accounts the accountant deals with are insanely complex - Kendrick's character inexplicably unravels the plot as quickly as Affleck's alleged super genius does. Add in the very simple fact that her character is utterly extraneous to the entire movie - you could literally remove her from the whole movie and it would still work out pretty much the same - it was just a disastrous piece of casting for a terrible role of little value to the ensemble.BUT - it is a phenomenal flashback movie!! If you don't mind being force-fed background in flashback after flashback after flashback after flashbac...you get the idea - then this is THE movie for you. Very, very few of the flashbacks (and flashbacks make up most of the movie really) are even remotely needed - or add anything at all the film. They are just lame padding for an incredibly weak script.The only real piece of entertainment in the whole show is the 1980s approach to the plot - ""uselessness for 1h 50m - cram the entire plot explanation into the last 3 mins"" - that and the fact that you will, I promise you, finish the movie questioning 90% of the decisions made by 100% of the cast. Nothing makes sense in this respect. I sat with my mouth open at the end of the movie with a ""how stupid do you think they public are?"" look on my face - the decisions made by the characters are THAT ridiculous.I try never to review a movie that leaves spoilers - so I can't even get into the nitty-gritty of what makes this such a hideous movie. Now - if you go into it with the above in mind - you will enjoy the movie. If someone had said to me - ""think John Wicke levels of utter rubbish, but with some idiot casting Anna Kendrick in an effort to make it worse"" - I would have enjoyed the movie immensely - my expectations would have been low enough. But I like Ben Affleck and thought it couldn't possibly be as bad as Reeves' John Wicke (or *shudder* Affleck's Daredevil) - but it truly, truly was.It's not ""Intelligent""; it's not well acted; it's not a ""great"" script - it's not even a passable C movie. It has some adequate action scenes (hence the rating of 2) - but for the most part - it drags, it sucks and you should avoid it all costs.The ludicrous, airy-fairy resolution of two of the supporting cast will leave you hating this movie. If the above issues don't already do that.And no - not even John Lithgow could save it."
" Different Yet Excellent Movie
",0.5719,0.9603,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"The Accountant is a very different movie; sort of Rainman meets The Equalizer. It's a bit of slow burn at first as the characters and background are established, and perhaps a tad confusing - however, never boring - and the second half of the movie comes to life as the action ramps up and everything falls into place, including a couple of nice twists.Great job by Ben Afflek and Anna Kendrick very ably backed up by good performances from John Bertham and veteran actor John Lithgow. The story line is a tad out there yet strangely convincing. Stick with it, that's my one and only piece of advice, and I'll guarantee you'll end up agreeing that The Accountant, while different, is a great movie. One of the best movies I've seen in a long while."
" Great Action Movie - Can Watch On Repeat
",0.6249,0.9955,2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"i loved it. action film junkies would love it too. in general, it's a story about a reclusive accountant (Ben Affleck) with extraordinary problem-solving skills, who is also managing a personality disorder, until he encounters a fellow problem-solver (Anna Kendrick) who has gotten in over her head and needs his help. it has a great balance between emotion and action. Affleck is brilliant in the role. he employs beautiful nuances in his performance and he's hilarious. (my theater was clapping and oo-awwing the whole time) i hope to see sequels. Anna Kendrick was her usual witty self, but i think Affleck trumped her a bit in this one. i never saw her as an action girl, but she did great. serious credit goes to the editors, because the storytelling was powerful mostly due to the way the visual pieces fit together. everything was harmonious. i could watch this again and again, and learn something new about the characters. isn't that the hallmark of a great movie? well, i highly recommend it. in a nutshell, it was an action flick about thinkers, and it was fun.9/10*Potential Spoiler* only thing I did not like about the film was having Kendrick as a potential love interest. she looked like a child in comparison to Affleck, and that made it a little uncomfortable to watch. but they are still a charismatic, funny duo. maybe she could play Robin??"
" I must have watched a different movie...
",0.0,0.3391,2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"... because Internets gave 7.5 stars average to this???The whole thing is predictable and if you have at least half of a brain you will figure it out within the first half an hour including the ending.I watched it with my girlfriend who happens to be a special needs teacher, so yeah, she knows her stuff. Me, I just know few things about autism spectrum, but I called bul1$!t on most of it anyway. I can't imagine how hard it was for her to watch. She went out to the kitchen to brew a cup of tea and especially asked me not to pause it for her...Movie is bad, really bad, I mean you are re-thinking your existence through out and wonder if your time has so little value that it is OK to waste it on Cr4p like this... Acting was lame, but like fake on purpose lame. Affleck could be excused because he was playing an ""autistic"" genius, right? But why the rest of them forgot how to act? I had more fun writing this review than watching this movie :DDon't watch it. Go out with your dog. Play scrabble. Do few push ups maybe? Anything, but not this..."
" Formulaic and passable
",0.0,0.9805,2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie had so much potential and yet, it falls flat on it's face. I mean you have Batman and the future Jim Gordon being directed by the guy who directed Warrior. What else do you need? Oh ya, a believable story.DIRECTION - At the end of the movie when I saw the name Gavin O'Connor and rechecked how I felt about the movie, I felt even more disappointed. This wasn't what I was expecting. Nowadays you cannot trust a movie on the basis of trailers. Truth be told, I was expecting this movie to be the amalgamation of 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Jason Bourne' but it falls into the category of passable action movies that I've seen in last few years like, 'Dead Man Down' or 'The Drop'. The whole just felt so bland and formulaic. It was like he tried to present us a puzzle but didn't have the capability to construct one. Every single thing fell right into it's desired place, without explanation. The director delved so much into the back-story of the accountant via flashbacks that he shortened the time to explain what is happening in the present day scenario. That obviously led to glaring plot-holes and very less character development.SCREENPLAY - You bring in a complex character with a troubled past into a shady scenario. Now tell me, why would you want to decode the character through flashbacks? Let him stay that way because he is the accountant. We don't need to know what he was and why he became what he is through flashbacks. The 1st scene itself was enough to show the rift between the mother and the father and also the relationship between the brothers. There are so many flashbacks that I don't even know what the current plot was. I could have watched it a second time but I don't have the courage or the energy. As I mentioned earlier, these recurring flashback scenes didn't leave space for the characters who are involved in the case. Anna Kendricks' character felt so poorly written and unnecessary. The dialogue was very flat and didn't have any weight. When you're building a drama then conversations are very important or the characters don't pop-up. On top of that, what did the investigation lead to? If you think about it, if you subtract J.K. Simmons and his side-kick from the entire film it wouldn't make a damn difference.ACTING - Ben Affleck is absolutely at his best right now. You give the man anything now, he will absolutely nail it. Despite of the plot- holes and no character development, this man stayed in character the whole movie. Rest everyone was passable. Jon Bernthal is a great actor, as I've seen his acting skills in the Daredevil, but here he is just meh! Seriously, every other actor just played a few scenes to get their paycheck and that's it. Ben Affleck had the most work and like I said, he nailed it!FINAL VERDICT - Nothing much to watch here. Very sad to see so much potential being wasted as if it doesn't matter. That's what bugs me. If the producers have so much money, then hire good scriptwriters and make a proper movie. I mean, you make an average movie and put up a good trailer, the movie will remain in the theaters for what? One week? You make a great movie, it will remain in everyone's minds forever.P.S. - I noticed the little Easter-egg, if it was one, of the Superman comic in Wolff's cupboard."
