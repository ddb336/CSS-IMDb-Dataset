" Good movie, but, ....
",0.2382,-0.34,2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,Got wrong ending (Redford decides to ignore postcards from friend Nolte and write book) for moral (enjoy family and friends).
" The hundred year old man hobbles through the woods
",0.0,-0.6115,2020-12-30 00:00:00,3,"Where to begin? Robert Redford, his hair dyed a shocking orange/red, looking every day of his 80+ years attempts to portray a man literally half his age (Bryson was in his 40s when he wrote the book/took the journey) with little success. The film bears little resemblance to the Bryson tale in the characterizations. Severely implausible that either of these elderly gentlemen would sustain more than a couple of days ""in the woods."" Just too hard to suspend disbelief. Yuck."
" Patient!
",0.0,0.9459,2020-12-21 00:00:00,7,"Bill (Robert Redford) and Katz (Nick Nolte) are seniors who go on a hike through the Appalachian mountains together by re-uniting after a good 30 years, the last time they met was in Europe as students. Redford is married to a British lady and quite settled as a book writer in the Jersey area but is looking for a new idea.The men wish to be close with nature once again covering 2118 miles on this trek but also connect with ordinary people on their trip, all the while surviving a grizzly bear attack. Looking like war veterans and learning about the changing times and a new country, they are nostalgic about past times.But when Bill returns, he can feel the fear in his wife's eyes as she cries in his arms. By the end of it, he gets the chance to write another book and is thankful for it. And Katz is content with the cleansing of the soul.Overall, the film reminds us about the spirit of teams which is more poignant toward the end scenes. It could have had better dialogues and with some effort, become a good film from an average one.I recommend this to all Redford fans and those who like trekking!"
" Moderate adaptation
",0.0,0.743,2020-11-30 00:00:00,6,"It's as though they appeased Bryson for leaving out much of his book by including a couple of his direct quotes. It's understandably difficult to match the book. A nice solution would be a series, similar to what was done with Catch-22. Nice casting and scenery."

" Good attempt -but read the book
",0.2382,0.9882,2020-10-05 00:00:00,6,"A writer, feeling age creeping up on him, decides to walk the Appellation Trail.
This is based on one of my favourite books so the movie had a lot to live up to.It didn't do too badly but you lose an awful lot from the book.This is well made has a stella cast (just about everyone is in it) and tries to stay faithful to the story.Bill Bryson's books tend to be humorous stories with lots of interesting and pertinent facts sprinkled throughout.
So in the book you get notes on how the Forestry Commission loves to chop down trees or notes about bear attacks.
It would be very dry to include this in the film so a lot of the dialog relies on laddy-banter between the two men. With nothing to break this up it makes the leads come across a bit sleazy.The film focuses on the characters, which is great, but means you lose any concept of what the Appellation trail is as the two men bumble through it.
The film doesn't convey how long and tough the trail is.
It is almost impossible for a mortal to complete in one attempt.
Areas of it are really wild, some shut down and other become impassible due to flooding or snow - so even if you are super fit the chances are that the calendar or the weather will catch up with you.A good film but I would recommend reading or listening to (there is a great audio version) the book first."
" Classy
",0.4404,0.8957,2020-10-03 00:00:00,8,"Classy. As the actors. A movie with messages for who understands these messages with a nice, sweet, gentlemen's sense of humour almost at every scene. Classic somehow from a time machine."

" Everything just seemed wrong.
",-0.4767,0.5194,2020-09-30 00:00:00,2,"Knowing the synopsis my first impression was surely Robert Redford is too old.
When he went home to Emma Thompson I thought she must be his daughter.
How wife? No, that can't be right.
So, Redford and Nick Nolte set of to walk the Appalachian Trail, the latter looking like a trip to a hospital would be more appropriate.
It just looked all wrong, then Redford was flirting with Mary Steenburgen ... really?
So looked I up BIll Bryson ... and he was in his forties when he had this adventure, not 79 as Redford was, and his real wife is 2 years his junior not 23 (Thompson) and 17 (Steenburgen).
As producer, Redford has only himself to blame for this miscasting and the telling of a tale which should have been so much more accurate and interesting. It also could have been a family film, but the profanities compromised that."
" Everything sounds big in the woods.
",0.0,0.9792,2020-09-23 00:00:00,6,"If you want to watch this movie for an accurate representation of Appalachian Trail and/or hiking culture you will be disappointed. If you want to watch this movie for interesting plot or relatable characters you will probably also be disappointed. If you want to listen to a good soundtrack.. no this one is also pretty bad :)So what's good about A Walk in the Woods? Well it's always good to see Nick Offerman on screen, Kristen Schaal (or Mabel from 'Gravity Falls') manages to portray the hiking companion from your nightmares and Nick Nolte's voice is so gritty and coarse you could substitute him on Tom Waits album. Best character in the movie is played by Emma Thompson but she has about 5 minutes of screen time. Ending is also quite surprising.To summarize, if you are into hiking or Appalachian Trail you are probably better off watching a documentary on YT, if you like Robert Redford well perhaps watch him in a different movie. If you want to watch a comedy about two old friends reminiscing about past while pulling off their 'one last' big adventure then give it a go."

" Enjoyed It More than I Anticipated
",0.5106,0.985,2020-09-16 00:00:00,6,"I have read the book and loved the book. Bryson's wit, humour and whimsy shine throughout. It is also agreeably informative in a way that is not didactive; another of Bryson's talents. For the film I always saw a more serious John Candy play Katz and a younger Richard Dreyfuss play Bryson.Reading other comments I knew that the film did not particularly reflect Bryson's book, and was therefore primed to dislike it.True, the two main actors are far too old for their parts and are physically unconvincing, which is perhaps why the title of the book/film is taken literally by the director (no demanding hiking here). It is also true that too much of the film is made up and does not reflect the book. Bryson's wit is also largely absent (would some narration of his thoughts have got across his wit?).Having said all of that, if the viewer regards the film merely as inspired by the book, then this can be a pleasurable and reasonably amusing viewing experience. I quickly adopted that mindset and consequently enjoyed the film for what it was, a light-hearted ramble of physical and mental exploration for two old men reconnecting for a last hurrah."
" Great story based on a great book

It's not exactly the same as the book, films rarely are. But it's great none the less.Bill is a man in his early sixties who after attending a funeral realises there is a long distance walking trail at the end of his back garden. He decides to walk the 3000+ km long Appalachian Trail along with a former friend he hadn't seen for 40 years.The story is quirky and well paced with plenty of beautiful scenery shots of the trail."

" Movies are Movies, Books are Books
",0.0,0.9684,2020-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Neither the two meet up exactly. Nor are they meant to. Fact and Fiction can intertwine: both can be a form of entertainment be it in a book or in a movie. I always measure a common or same story by it's weight as either/or a book or a movie. The book is great reading, classic ""Mr. Bill"" writing. I have read it five times. The movie is great light hearted viewing with two great actors. I have viewed it 3 times.
The book relies on the reader's imagination to build the picture, the people are words as described. The movie gives you a picture, the characters become real replacing the words of the text with action, visual and auditory.
Both are great entertainment. exactly they are meant to be. Nothing more nothing less. although, Mr. Bill does make some astute and serious observations based on facts about the parks and forests.
The movie needs special consideration by me. I was born in 1951. Near to the same age as Bill Bryson and Nick Nolte. As a baby boomer, I can relate to the portrayed acting by Bill and Robert. It is clear that they also relate to the roles. For later personages born in the next groups, there may be something missing. But that is life. We all have different takes on life and what is entertaining.
So just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is, and read the book taking in your own interpretation for what it is. Signed, ""Mr. Lee"""

" An enjoyable movie!
",0.4926,0.9908,2020-07-19 00:00:00,8,"I loved watching this film for many reasons but the best reason is that it was a feel good movie.
I have also listed more reasons why I thought it was a good one:
It's Robert Redford.
It's Nick Bolte.
Its funny in quite a lot of ways.
It's down to earth.
It's also inspiring!Here's a list of why it won't match up to the book:
These guys are in there 70s when the film was made. In the book they are in their 40's (speaking for Bill).
Also nothing ever matches up to the book, so what chance is there?! (Can I get an Amen?)In response to the resounding 'why is it important that this film was made?' that I regularly hear shouted out from street windows as I walk by...It's important because these producers wanted it to be made. I can now see why it's important to produce a film if you have the idea and will to produce it. This may seem obvious but what I mean is that if these guys didn't produce a Bill Bryson movie, who is to say that anyone else definitely will (although Bill's books are surely worth it).
If these guys didn't make the adaption now then it would have gone by to nothing and it's a blessing that they did make it.Hope you like it!"
" with nature, i'm in

Even though his wife Catherine (Emma Thompson) doesn't want him to hike and considering to his age, but he thinks that hiking to The Appalachian Trail reconnects him to the life. And he calls nearly everyone he knew for walking with him but he keeps taking ""no's"". However Katz (Nick Nolte) who is a slightly whacky and drunken fella that is a man who hikes with Bill a long time ago reaches Bill and with that call, Bill finds himself a hiking partner.Questionable and unfit duo, Bill and Stephen, hit the road together and it turned to be an adventure that is actually enjoyable and quite eventful one.This film is in touch with nature and it is a film about hiking the trail, that reminds of these kind of films such as; Wild, Into the Wild and Captain Fantastic. If you like the movies which is in touch with nature and foliage, you'll love the movies which i said hereinabove.And i have to say that Nick Nolte fits the character of Katz, performs incredibly well and especially in sense of humour way, he's an absolute must for the film.And also, i gotta say that Mary Steenburgen is a beautiful and nice lady who ages like a fine wine.By the way, i've learned the movie which is an adapted screenplay that is based on the book ""A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail by Bill Bryson. In real life, Bill Bryson was mid-40s when he went to this adventure. I just say that because you can think about Robert Redford's age after watching the film. lol"

" A fairly mediocre adaptation, salvaged by a wonderful Nick Nolte performance
",0.5719,0.9771,2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"Taken at face value, A Walk In The Woods is a very pleasant, enjoyable and humorous film highlighted by a charming performance by Nick Nolte and a great cameo from Kristen Schaal. For Bryson enthusiasts however, I can understand that this may have felt a little flat and underdone.The setting is obviously stunning but I do feel they could have emphasised the glorious backdrop a little more. Redford is underwhelming as Bryson and it seems like he isn't challenged at all by this screenplay. Given how strong this cast is, the writing is a bit disappointing and the film should have been far more compelling."

The film hardly bothers to let you know which state you're in, and completely misses all of the Bryson humor contained in his love of detail - particularly in the way he describes their meals and snacks. I read the book 15 years ago but the funniest bits ( especially the bear related stories) are still with me. I could manage the first 45 minutes of this insipid film before abandoning it. Nothing memorable here folks, except to acknowledge that it's actually possible to dumb down a great piece of work this much. Lowest common denominator territory; keep walking."

The two couldn't be more different and that's what makes this film so wholesome.The acting absolutely great, Robert Redford does great, but Nick Nolte is just as good.
Music choice: perfect. If the film by itself didn't give you a warm feeling already, the combination with the music most certainly will.This is the perfect film to watch with your family during the winterdays, altough it still will be great in the summer obviously.8/10"

",0.0,0.9395,2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"A Walk in the Woods was supposed to be a reteaming of Robert Redford and Paul Newman. The project was scuppered when Newman died.However it was belatedly resurrected with Nick Nolte playing the Newman part. Interestingly as Nolte must have spent a lifetime accepting roles that Redford rejected. For Example, Martin Scorsese was desperate to have Redford as the lead in Cape Fear.In this fictionalised tale based on true facts. Redford plays travel writer Bill Bryson who has returned to the USA after a spell in Britain.Getting older, bored and restless. Bryson finds that old friends are dying one by one. Not wanting life to pass him by, he decides to trek the 2000 miles Appalachian Trail. His wife is not keen on this adventure and insists he does not go alone.The only person who accepts his invitation is Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte.) As young men they toured Europe together where both ended up being hostile to each other. Now Katz is old, out of shape and a recovering alcoholic.Both men with little training go out on their hike unprepared. They are exhausted a quarter and a mile later. They only have several more months and thousand miles to endure.A Walk in the Woods is a gentle amiable and given the star power a low budget film. You can tell some of the stars only signed on so they can work with Redford. It is amusing and fun.Redford is effectively playing the straight man to Nolte, who plays the grizzled lothario still summoning up enough juices to get a little bit of fun."
" Not Every Movie Has To Be Non-Stop Action
",0.0,0.9974,2018-08-31 00:00:00,7,"If you're the sort of movie goer who needs non-stop action, or never ending comedy, or glitzy CGI or mind-bending special effects then you should really avoid ""A Walk In The Woods."" It is, essentially, exactly what the title suggests - a walk in the woods. A very long walk, but a walk nonetheless. And there was something about the premise that appealed to me. And then, of course, there was the cast - which is essentially Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. How could you go wrong with two successful, veteran actors like that? And, well, you can't. And what you end up with in ""A Walk In The Woods"" is a pleasant, often funny and sometimes even educational movie that's just nice to watch. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.Redford played Bill Bryson - a real travel writer who hiked the Appalachian Trail in 1998 with his friend Stephen Katz (Nolte.) The movie is loosely based on the book. One of the major differences between the movie and the book is the age of the hikers. The real Bryson and Katz weren't that old. Bryons was in his late 40's when he undertook the journey. So, really, this isn't Bryson's story. It's Redford's take on Bryson's story, imagined from the perspective of two pretty old guys. In the movie Bryson overcomes opposition form his wife, who doesn't want him to walk the Trial, and reconnects with Katz - an old friend he had spent time in Europe with years before but who he had lost contact with. They set out from the southern end of the Trail in Georgia with the goal of making it the whole way to Maine. They're old, they're not experienced hikers, and so they have a lot of adventures along the way and a few memorable people to meet. There's a lot of humour - most of it pretty gentle humour but enough to elicit a laugh or at least a chuckle.The supporting cast (who play relatively small parts since most of this is Redford and Nolte) all hold up their ends well. Emma Thompson is probably most important as Bryson's wife Catherine, and there are memorably funny performances from Kristen Schaal as fellow hiker Mary Ellen and Susan McPhail as Katz's almost ""hook-up"" Beulah. Mary Steenburgen also has a small role in this as a woman running a hotel/cafe where Bryson and Katz eat.In the midst of it all, you learn a little something about threats to various species of trees along the Trail, and you get some breathtaking shots of the Trail itself.I doubt this would have much appeal to anyone under the age of 50, but for the over-50 crowd (I qualify on that count) it should be an enjoyable watch. Perhaps nothing particularly memorable or unique - but enjoyable. (7/10)"

They walk on the trail and talk about old times that was rather boring. If there was any real meaning or theme in what Nolte was slurring I missed it as his drone was putting me to sleep. They were probably the only two hikers to ever encounter a non-native Grizzly on the trail. Mary Ellen (Kristen Schaal) made the film interesting for a bit, but then she left the picture. She describes the people she meets as ""boring boring dumb dumb."" And that pretty much summed things up. I would recommend ""Wild"" if you want to stay awake during a hiking film.

" Forget this film-read the book instead!..
",-0.2942,0.9826,2018-02-01 00:00:00,1,"I have just finished watching this, and wish to record my critique of the film while it's still fresh in my mind.
First, let me say how disappointed I was. Bill Bryson himself has purportedly stated on record that he was impressed at how the film captures the spirit of the book. I disagree wholeheartedly. As a huge fan of all his writings, this work is one of my favourites, and I have read it many times. The film completely misses the warm and engaging nature of the book. We are subjected to preachy lectures from Bryson (Robert Redford) at various stages of the film, which are a world apart from the concerns that Bryson expresses in his writings about the current state of preservation of flora & fauna in the book, and specifically how the National Parks Service have actually worked to the detriment of these. 
Other reviewers have spoken of the complete miscasting of Redford in the leading role, with which I agree, but I also think Nolte was miscast-I've always pictured Jon Lovitz in the role. Emma Thompson was woefully underused-if you've cast an actress of her talents, use them, or cast somebody less well-known in the role. The same could also be said of Mary Steenburgen.
Huge chunks of the book are left out, which is perhaps to be expected when making a film, but it's puzzling why certain sections were chosen, and others left out. There are also parts of the film which are complete invention, such as the bears invading their camp, and the falling off the trail, and one section which has been lifted from one of Bryson's other works (The Lost Continent). Bill Bryson is a much accredited writer, whose works have drawn praise from all sectors of the professional world, so why did the screenwriters (Rick Kerb and Bill Holderman) think they could do a better job?..
Finally, the AT winds its way through some of the most breath-taking scenery in the Eastern USA, and yet the film does very little to illustrate this, and feels more like a student production in its editing and cinematography. At least in 'Wild' (2014), when Reese Witherspoon did a similar thing and walked the Pacific Crest Trail, albeit for very different reasons, the scenery was one of the stars of the film... Lovingly and beautifully filmed by Yves Bélanger under the direction ofJean-Marc Vallée-perhaps Canadians do it better, eh?.. The acting from the two leads is stilted and wooden-another sign of poor direction.
So, in summing up, I've said it before, and I'll say it again... Forget the film, read the book instead-you'll enjoy it far more, and it'll make you want to read his other works (I own the complete collection). Unfortunately, Mr Redford, you've let yourself and all the rest of us down badly on this occasion.Yves Bélanger"

The film is not quite about Bryson (Redford)'s mid-life crisis (as he's now in his 70s, not 40s like the book), but he and a formerly-estranged friend, Stephen Katz (Nolte) set off on the Appalachian Trail, which spans America's east coast, from Georgia in the South to Maine in the North - 2,100 miles (~3,500km)!From the director of 'He's Just Not That Into You' and 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants' - not a promising pedigree! - Kwapis nonetheless does a good job of keeping the pace up, which can be hard when it's mostly two guys just walking and talking! But therein lies the beauty of the film - it's simple and sweet, with plenty of jokes and wit between the two old friends, some quick interactions with other hikers on the Trail (such as Schaal, gratingly funny!) and some breathtaking wilderness shots.It did remind me of my time in the U.S., when I did visit the Pisgah Forest in North Carolina and the Great Smoky National Park in Tennessee, where they start their hike. The scenery is helped by Lord Huron's soundtrack, which is folky, but upbeat. The final third is not as engaging as it could be, but there's some sincere moments to be found amongst the humour and everything is propelled by Nolte & Redford's enjoyable chemistry."
" Not the book. Not even close.
",0.0,0.959,2017-12-27 00:00:00,3,"This book was informative and hilarious storytelling...Bryson at his best. The movie? It's pleasant enough, I guess. But turning this classic hiking story into the equivalent of ""Last Vegas"" definitely dampened things. This should have been more than old guy jokes and slapstick. But it's the perfect movie for when your parents come over, and the scenery/acting are good enough to pass the time. Realism? No."
" So Dull
",-0.4576,0.8855,2017-11-08 00:00:00,3,"I haven't read the book, so I wasn't expecting anything in particular from this film, but I *did* expect it to be interesting, full of spectacular scenery, and to have some decent dialogue. At best, this movie is inoffensive, and at worst, it is just boring.The premise looked promising and the stars looked reliable, but in the end the film lacked bite and the characters didn't hold my interest. There's a reason I don't watch Hallmark movies, and this one is on par with those, unfortunately.Oh well, there were one or two shots of nice scenery."
" A pleasant, uplifting viewing experience
",0.5106,0.9862,2017-11-03 00:00:00,8,"I had a group of 6 friends over for a movie night. We all enjoyed this movie very much. Apart from the humour, there were moments of pathos as well as the wonderful scenery. Bryson's book is my very favourite non fiction book. It has been a hugely popular best seller. I think that explains a lot of the disappointment and criticism that the film version has attracted. Naturally, there's a lot more in the book and the film has a couple of inaccuracies. Unfortunately this is true of many movies based on books. Admittedly Redford and Nolte were too old for the roles. Bryson and his friend Katz were only in their mid 40's when they did the walk. However, as our viewing group were all over 60, the older ages of the two actors added another dimension to the movie that we could all relate to - the challenge of a last great adventure before senescence really starts to set in. All in all a pleasant uplifting movie, which I could watch again."
" Practically perfect!
",0.6114,0.9967,2017-09-26 00:00:00,9,"Retired travel writer Robert Redford is bored. He has a beautiful house, a loving wife, Emma Thompson, and semi-affectionate grandchildren, but he's bored. His idea? Getting together with a buddy and hiking the Appalachian trail, or as he phrases it when he calls all his friends, ""going for a walk in the woods."" Hence the title.The only snag in his plan? None of his friends want to join him—except Nick Nolte, whom he hasn't seen in decades. They don't see eye to eye on much, but they're stuck together during this hilarious and sweet movie about finding happiness. When you're not laughing yourself silly from every line Nick Nolte delivers, you'll be able to appreciate the beautiful nature that surrounds them, and it's always great to see Robert Redford in a setting he loves so passionately. He gives a little speech about how important it is to appreciate and protect nature, and the movie wouldn't feel complete without it.I absolutely love this movie, and I can't think of anyone I wouldn't recommend it to. There isn't anyone in the world who hates Robert Redford, and there's nothing offensive in the script. It's funny, clever, thoughtful, touching, and wise."
" Very disappointing
",-0.5413,0.1103,2017-08-16 00:00:00,3,"All I could think to myself during this movie was: Bill Bryson must be so mortified.First of all, I have read ALL of his books and the Robert Redford portrayal was NOTHING like how BB comes across in his very witty and intelligent books. NOTHING! And like many other reviewers have noted, he was also much younger than RR when he did this walk.The movie was too slow and I didn't get a good feel for the main star: The Appalachian Trail.The book is a million times better in every respect. Just bypass this awful movie and read the book instead."
" Sideways Geriatric
",0.0,0.9074,2017-07-15 00:00:00,4,"There's a classic (though probably unintentional) homage when Robert Redford, as a bored travelogue writer, and Nick Nolte, as his once-wild companion, are staring off the edge of an Appalachian Trail peak with nowhere to go but way, way down... Well the younger SUNDANCE could have survived but these guys are just too old to take risks... Though not entirely...The hike is quite a chore, especially so late in life, and the first twenty minutes doesn't really develop the characters but plays a sort of hesitation game while learning about other people that don't matter much (like Emma Thompson as a wife so open-minded she's just not interesting)... So once the journey finally gets underway, it's all about Redford's classy-wise Bill and Nolte's shaggy, weathered Stephan.Feeling catered to a mainstream audience and taking on a BUCKET LIST plot without Cancer, the movie itself hikes from here to there in a breezy, safe fashion. So when a load of misadventures happen (and keep happening) to the boys, from an annoying female camper to a jealous small town husband, the results feel contrived. But there is one particular scene (led by Nolte) where they not only genuinely bond with each other, the audience gets to see past the cliché ""we're too old for this"" template and the two veteran actors get to finally... act their talents."
" Cute.
",0.4588,0.9458,2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"Robert Redford plays author Bill Bryson as he and his friend Stephen Katz (played by Nick Nolte) walk the Appalachian trail. I've not read the book - I'm not awful keen on Bryson's stuff - but the movie is cute enough. Couple of old guys on the trail reflecting on life. It's a little uneven trying to tackle too many of the threads from the book.The Journey Aging Humor Environmentalism/ScienceIf they had left out the ""Environmentalism/Science"" which comes across as oddly placed footnotes it would be a tighter movie.Don't take it too seriously and it's OK - cute."
" Amusing little movie
",0.3818,0.986,2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"As far as awkward buddie movies go, A walk in the woods is relatively safe terrain. It doesn't have a great deal of charm but it is amusing, and the scenery is nice. Nick Nolte is an actor that doesn't do much for me. I have always found him hammy and unconvincing but his fits like a glove into this movie. He brings a great comedic touch to his over the top personality, and is the perfect contrast to the strait man of Robert Redford, who may be a little too straight for this movie. They hike the Appalacian trail together. Redford chooses this unlikely escape in the hope that it will help his writers' block. The two of them Huff and puff their way through the hills during the day and camp at night. They encounter snow, quicksand, bears, and the angry husband of a seduced woman. They have some exchanges that will make you laugh, and some others which are supposed to be insightful but aren't reallyA walk in the Woods is perfectly content to be a small movie, and thats what it is. It might have gone further with another actor playing the Redford role. Even the straight man needs to acknowledge that he is in a comedy, but Redford is too composed and takes himself too seriously."
" Lovely, warm, funny and sweet
",0.891,0.9744,2017-04-27 00:00:00,9,"It's slow, focused, full of nature. It's the opposite of Hollywood-style, extended, overfilled story, where one sentence can reverbarate for several minutes, and let's you think for a moment. It's almost like you can meditate in the cinema and you leave the theater refreshed and calm and happy. It's a lovely story, very funny at times, romantic in terms of our connection to nature and the universe. I love to come back to it from time to time, became one of my 'allways-must-haves"" on the video shelf."
" Too old to rock 'n' roll, but not to hike the Appalachian Trail
",0.0,0.9562,2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Released in 2015, ""A Walk in the Woods"" stars Robert Redford as an over-the-hill writer who decides to hike the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail. After his wife (Emma Thompson) insists he get a partner, the only one who's up for it is an old overweight friend with a drinking problem (Nick Nolte). Kristen Schaal and Mary Steenburgen have peripheral roles, amongst others. I rate movies according to what they are and aspire to achieve. This is a consistently amusing drama/adventure starring two seasoned veterans and it thoroughly delivers the goods as quality entertainment spiced with worthy mindfood. Some people complain that Redford and Nolte were too old for the parts (they were 78 and 73 during filming) in light of the real Bill Bryson and Katz being in their 40s in the satirical 1998 biography, but without them the movie wouldn't have been made and, besides, they're eminently effective in the roles and drive home the point of out-of-shape, mature wannabe hikers. It's vastly superior to Emilio Estevez' similar ""The Way"" (2010). The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot along the Appalachian Trail in North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, as well as Sharon, Connecticut. It was directed by Ken Kwapis from a script by Michael Arndt & Bill Holderman from Bill Bryson's book. GRADE: A-"
" Enjoyable and funny
",0.7003,0.9962,2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie today on Amazon Prime. I hadn't come across it previously, but I had read Bryson's ""A walk in the woods"" book a few years ago. Bottom line is that I really enjoyed the movie. It isn't a complicated plot, just a buddy movie about two ageing pals who go off on a walking adventure on the Appalachian Trail. They are mismatched on various levels, and pretty unprepared for the trek, but they get through quite a lot of it. Bryson's books are light-hearted easy reading delights, probably never envisioned to become movies, but I do feel that this movie does fair justice to the spirit of the book. The actors are perfect and do a great job – albeit that they are probably rather older here than Bryson and Katz were at the time. The movie isn't supposed to be a kind of guide to the Appalachian Trail – as some reviewers here seem to think. It is just a bit of fun centred on these two men and their adventures on the trail as well as their reflections on the earlier days of their friendship and the ways their lives have worked out. It is genuinely funny, and I laughed a lot.One small gripe - and this really applies to all movies where characters are required to carry backpacks. It is just too blatantly obvious to me that the packs have been filled with nothing heavier than a block of polystyrene. Maybe it would be a bit cruel to load these ageing actors with 20kg packs, so I will let them off with that here."
" Just a down to earth hike
",0.0,0.9839,2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"It's just Bob Redford and Nick Nolte on a trip, walking in the woods. That's pretty much it. I thought it was amusing and had some nice moments.I liked the landscapes the choose for the film. You get a little feeling that you kind of wanna take a hike there yourself. I've been on a lot of hikes before when I was younger. I was reminded of that while watching this. The two main characters were all right. They had some good banters and chemistry. Redford and Nolte seemed to have had a lot of fun making this. It didn't feel like something done for the money.Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. The music is relaxing and it worked well with some of the montage scenes. So, yes. It is just a neat down to earth little movie about some friends walking in the woods. I thought it was all right."
" They're off on the road to Appylasia.
",0.0,0.9955,2017-01-19 00:00:00,4,"The first shot of Robert Redford in this film is rather surprising; the 80 year old glamour '70s boy looks like he should be darkening his hair and play Ronald Reagan after he left the White House. Yes, those first few moments are very jarring, especially when it is established that he is married to Emma Thompson. A supposedly popular expert on travel, he wants to hike the entire Appalation trail (from Georgia to Maine) and ends up bringing along (reluctantly at first) the out of shape, drunken, raspy voiced Nick Nolte. Along the way, they meet a bunch of mostly annoying people, deal with all sorts of inclimate weather and a series of wacky, unbelievable situations that would make Hope and Crosby blush.So the idea of traveling down the Appalations or the continental divide has crossed my mind (and passed me by), but at least here, I get to see what part of the east coast trail looks like. I don't know that I'd be pleased dealing with braggarts claiming that their style of hiking was better than mine. I certainly would not be allowing someone like Kirsten Schaal infiltrate on my vacation for more than 5 minutes. I could have done without big bad Bertha who asks Nolte to help her untangle her parties that super glue couldn't repair. I could have done with more of the still beautiful Mary Steenburgen, wasted in a five minute space. Thompson, too, underused and obviously not believable as the aged Redford's mate.This is supposedly based upon a true story of younger characters, and after getting used to Redford's flabby face skin and Nolte's whiskey soaked voice, I still had the issue of them being just far too miscast. What is on screen are not the lovers of two of Barbra Streisand's greatest romantic films but what remains of them, two leading men far past their prime and trying to be Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey even past their prime. It is not a dignified look at the desire to stay young, with them pretty much acting like fools, especially when Redford repeats a similar scene from one of his first hits that doesn't hwbr the impact more than 40 years later."
" the movie has failed the book
",-0.5106,-0.702,2017-01-15 00:00:00,4,"I love the book, so I was understandably excited when it was announced that there would be a movie based on it, with Redford and Nolte, no less. Turns out the movie has nothing to do with the book, and it feels as if nobody involved in the movie read the book, or understood it. The book is about hiking, about how the scale and distances acquire totally new meaning when your'e on foot. It's about the Zen of making one step after another. It's about having the time to notice the details in the landscape. It is about hating the hiking, and being enthralled by it. It is also about curiosity, and about self-mockery as a constant background hum.In the movie all of this turned upside down. The hiking becomes an afterthought to motels, restaurants and poor attempts at jokes, the character of Bryson comes across as self-righteous and narrow-minded, the curiosity has been replaced with didactic and pompous recital of facts. The addition of the ""Ledge scene"" is worst of all, the conversation among the protagonists jarringly out of sync with their supposed characters.If I hadn't read the book, I'd probably look at the movie as simply a mediocre comedy. But if it presumes to be based on the book, I have to say it has let the book down. Sad, really."
