" So... much... shake... im gonna throw up
",0.0,-0.7675,2021-03-08 00:00:00,3,"The movie is a rather unremarkable action thriller following a famed protagonist on yet another quest for answers. It's nothing new, but hey, that's not something too terrible. Obligatory round trip across several European cities, a razor thin plot, just to have something to connect the action.What makes this movie almost completely unwatchable is the camera direction. This thing doesn't stand still for a single moment. Incredibly short cuts, permanent violent shakes. Many dark scenes where its hard to make one object from another and combined with the lightning fast camera work, it makes for one nauseating experience."
" An Enjoyable Action Film
",0.4404,0.9339,2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Sure it basically plays as a greatest hits montage of Supremacy and Ultimatum, but those elements are still enjoyable. I actually think the shaky cam is much more effective here than in the other Bourne films. The story is a lot weaker and the decision to kill a certain character off towards the beginning annoyed me, but the action is still really strong and Damon is still really good. The villain is decently intimidating and, despite it being longer than any of the OT, it pretty much flew by. Overall the story isn't great and none of the characters are particularly well developed, but it works as a very enjoyable action flick, and I would recommend it, particularly if you liked the other films in the franchise."

",0.2382,-0.9863,2021-01-23 00:00:00,5,"It is an interesting legal and philosophical question but there's no true privacy by 2016.
The Fact that the US is depicted of having the only desire to infiltrate social media is moronic and a Turn that Hollywood has taken since the mid 90s.
The sad reality is if everyone went of these moronic platforms you'd have significantly reduced global tension with these controversial platforms, speech issues, trolling etc...political revolutions that go nowhere. The most obvious clear example of this was ISIS (and I don't know why people think they're gone)...
This obsession of blaming government regardless of party thought it tends to really give a lashing to the GOP, and the overall lack of trust in the media and the system are a direct result of people's need to be on them.
Read the NYT or the NYP in its own app...why via Twitter?
Then forget the deleterious results of society and normal social behavior GLOBALLY... but there's a huge rise to a sophisticated criminal. It's like the extreme in Die Hard 4 is very realistic...market manipulation, online banking...online DMV if you think you have real privacy...anyone...you're an idiot.
I have to say it....The first amendment shouldn't have to be questioned and reevaluated because people are addicted to these platforms...posting their infants...data mining, targeted advertising tailored to you.
A private company whether we like it or not can block whoever they want. When you work for a company you're Freedoms are gone...you want to vent how much you hate your boss you don't do it in the office...
Back to this, it's entertaining but not needed the first three told the story, the problem with it is I don't know why these security nuts remain when the previous nuts were arrested.

It is there to cover the other middle finger : the fact that you're just watching characters walking down halls all aggravated. When there's some chase or crash, It's so fidgety and poorly cut together, that even that's not fun. 80% of the scenes are shakier than Blair witch. Even if the actors are just standing there doing nothing in particular. It's an unwatchable pile of garbage."
" It was allright
",0.0,0.976,2020-12-22 00:00:00,6,"Coming off the Bourne Ultimatum from 2007, this movie should have been excellent. Matt Damon comes back and so does Paul Greengrass. The main plot with the social media thing goes absolutely nowhere. Matt Damon once again is great as Jason Bourne, but doesn't have a lot of material to work with. Vincent Cassell is great as a psychopathic assassin looking for revenge. The movie would have been an 8 out of 10 if they switched tommy lee jones, who looked like he didn't care at all( how can he not care, its a Bourne movie?!) Alicia vikander was allright in it as well. The main problem is that the cast doesn't have a lot to work with and the movie didn't feel full, if that makes sense. It felt like a cash grab but it had some great moments in it so well.... don't watch this movie expecting a movie like the Bourne ultimatum, watch it and except some great action and good acting from Damon."

If they didn't keep hounding him every time his name flagged up somewhere, it would save a lot of problems and deaths.Honestly I'm not sure why they bothered with this one or why Matt came back for it, let alone produced it. Maybe he was jealous of Jeremy taking over? But it doesn't add enough for me. It's too much of the same old, same old. It reminded me of being forced to watch ""24"", it's just variations on a theme every time.To start he is fine on his own, until for some reason he gets roped back in to the fray and because of that he needs answers and or revenge. Along the way there are a lot of gun fights, car and motorbike chases and a lot of call tracing and tracking systems. Ultimately it all works out fine for JB, but the corrupt government (By the way, don't they vet these people properly? They all seem to be maladjusted?) comes off badly in some way. That's not a spoiler, because if you've seen the first 3 and what I call the spin off number 4, then you will already know how this s£!t all goes down.There are some good things about it though. Mr Damon is as good as always and we finally get to see him at least topless.
Tommy Lee Jones was made for parts like these and although he's generally playing a grouchy guy in most films, I think in real life he's probably really nice and that we'd get along. Great performance by him.
I was surprised by Alicia Vikander, having been incredibly let down by her ""Tomb Raider"" film (I'll stick to Angelina thanks), but in this film she is perfect.The stunts are bigger and more destructive than ever (I hope they've all got insurance), but for me they are far too over the top and I find it very hard to believe that people are surviving these crashes and collisions and it's a shame, because I think until now it has been the right balance.It's not a bad film in its own right and perhaps if I hadn't watched them all in one week and gave myself time to forget the one that had gone before, I might not have been so bored by this one, but I doubt it.
In fact, at the end I wanted Jason to hand himself over to the police and be put in Prison to ensure that the series came to an end.I'd say it's a bit repetitive, but I'd just be repeating myself."

" Legacy was better than this
",0.4404,0.9045,2020-11-15 00:00:00,6,"This movie is just a complete drag. I wasn't expecting ultimatum, or even supremacy level. Or even at least a identity level movie. I was expecting a solid movie at the least. And although this film does deliver on a lot of ends and it's great seeing the original Bourne return back to formation... it just did NOT work at all. It would have been more interesting if they just continued the Legacy series. Although that movie wasn't as good it at least had some originality and refreshed story to do moving forward. I would have liked to se a trilogy of his, who knows it probably would have been better. Because the Bourne trilogy gets better as it continues I'm sure the legacy trilogy could have been interesting. I feel they felt way too nervous to continue it and just decided to do a cheap cash grab to get people back on the train but I'm glad they're not buying into it. Now this just tarnishes the franchise. Making there be a 4th movie apart of a already legendary trilogy... turned into a shit quadrille trilogy.... it's not a bad movie I give it a very light 6/10 but that rating is skating on thin ice... very bland."

" ""Matt Damon is"" Getting to old for this crud!
",0.0,0.9681,2020-11-08 00:00:00,5,"(Jason Bourne 2016) is meant to be a continuation of the original Bourne movie trilogy which starred (Matt Damon) as Jason Bourne. The trilogy ended with (The Bourne Ultimatum) back in 2007 which was meant to be the end of Bourne's story with the final movie ending on a high note that surpassed the expectations of both fans and critics. Then in 2014 came a new Bourne movie (The Bourne Legacy) which stared (Jeremy Renner) as a completely new character who has little to no connection to the original Bourne movies. The movie was a complete letdown which failed to capture the complex characters, smart storyline and memorable action sequences of the original Bourne trilogy.This movie was clearly made to try and revive the series by bringing (Matt Damon) back as Jason Bourne and by continuing the original storyline in an effort to try and create a new Bourne trilogy which would see the Jason Bourne character in similar situations as before trying to discover more about his past aswell as fighting a younger generation of the CIA while killing off the old bosses. The problem with this ""new storyline"" is that it's all been done before we have already seen Bourne tackle the CIA go into hiding then come out of hiding and go after the CIA again it's been done to death. The storyline is very predictable and boring there's nothing really new or original in this movie even the chase scenes that were a big part of the original movies have now become so easy to predict that you never really feel like Borne is any real danger. The original Bourne trilogy was fantastic it was smart, fast, action packed with interesting and likable characters aswell as having a thought provoking storyline with cleverly written dialogue that's both smart and sophisticated.(Jason Bourne 2016) is an unnecessary sequal to an already awsome trilogy. The only reason this movie exists is the same reason most movie sequels exist because producer's in Hollywood got greedy and decided to just make more of the same product in order to sell tickets no more no less.The movie isn't terrible by any means it still has plenty of enjoyable action scenes aswell as great acting by (Matt Damon) who even after nine years since playing the Jason Bourne character jumps right back into the action that he's known for in the series he may be a bit older and greyer than he was nine years ago but he's still a badass in this movie. The movie also stars (Tommy Lee Jones) who gives a solid performance as one of the older CIA directors who will do anything to take down Bourne even if it means sacrificing his own people.I am a huge fan of the original books by Robert Ludlum and I am also a big fan of the original movie trilogy and while I found this movie to be a bit of a disappointment it's still worth watching at least once it has some decent action scenes and some new backstory to the Bourne character which is somewhat interesting."

I'd never really been a big fan of anything Matt Damon but this movie actually captured my attention, provided a thrilling and sometimes tense watch & was packed full of action which is more than I could have asked for really.The casting was equally as impressive as the film with names like Tommy Lee Jones. I was especially pleased to see the inclusion of British Asian actor Riz Ahmed in this blockbuster & also the added touch of Alicia Vikander.There were some stages that were hard to follow & I couldn't help but think that maybe you'd understand if you've seen the previous movie in this series but all in all a solid plot, lots of action & it made for one evening's good entertainment."
" Bourne runs out of steam
",0.0,-0.9845,2020-10-25 00:00:00,6,"The first Bourne instalment of films may have been made back in the early 2000s but this one titled Jason Bourne was the latest as Matt Damon reprises the role of the namesake character. It's nothing new about this thriller with the usual plots and may I say several corrupt departments within the secret service as if there are Big Brother bits and pieces. It was directed by Paul Greengrass whom directed some of the previous films while co-scripted by Christopher Rouse but simply lacks the quality of the earlier films. If some of the Bourne films usually contain ridiculous plots, this one is a classic case with the tracking systems that seems to be everywhere and automatically keeping pace with Bourne whenever he's on location . It's not always very good as I think that co-scriptwriter Christopher Rouse whom stood in for the usual Bourne scriptwriter Tony Gilroy and with no previous ""Bourne experience"", was said to have done a very poor job. Some of the Bourne films were brutal but this one doesn't get to the point by being more brutal for brutality's sake and it's a shame the film didn't live up to expectations."

Even though I did score it a 5, it was because of Matt Damon, Paul Greengrass & Tommy Lee Jones though he didn't even look like he was trying.
Jason Bourne should have retired, he's older & doing things he would have never done in the years gone by and sometimes I found myself shaking my head in disbelief!
The final act made it a good ending & the sort of twist that made the others thrilling throughout, just too little too late."

",0.0,0.8008,2020-10-24 00:00:00,6,"I have to say that on the whole I have enjoyed the Jason Bourne series of films including this one. However, one has to despair at the scriptwriters falling headlong into a clichéd computer scenario right from the start.Nicky Clark enters some computer facility having had to give a passphrase to the door guard and then...1. While scanning the room one woman is heard to say ""Use SQL to corrupt their database"". Presumably the passphrase to get in and the room full of computer users was insufficient to alert the viewer that this is some clandestine facility and this throwaway comment was also needed. Could it be that the 'hacker' at the keyboard was so dumb that they needed to be told what language to use??2. Having used a backdoor to access top secret files, Nicky finds that they are in a folder helpfully called 'Black Ops' with subfolders using the Operation names! Not attempt whatsoever at obfuscating this precious data.3. For some strange reason Nicky doesn't use a VPN allowing the CIA to trace her exact whereabouts.4. The CIA operative types the command 'run predictive algorithm' at a command prompt. I guess she's running a script called 'predictive' with a parameter of 'algorithm'. What nonsense!5. Within seconds a message stating 'Malware uploaded' appears because that's exactly what happens when an intruder uses zero defences against malware.The whole scene is utterly preposterous for anyone who knows anything about how computer systems work and is just lazy scriptwriting that perpetuates a movie cliché. 4 stars off for an otherwise entertaining film."

" Jason Bourne shows up
",0.0,0.9222,2020-10-12 00:00:00,5,"Paul Greengrass really thinks he's Gillo Pontecorvo and Costa-Gavras, and he let that flag fly here in Jason Bourne. This is also the first Bourne film that does not involve Tony Gilroy (who apparently delivered a subpar first draft for The Bourne Ultimatum which really angered Matt Damon), and Greengrass himself has a writing credit. This is probably the most purely Greengrass movie of the Bourne franchise, and it really shows in not a very good way.That being said, Jason Bourne actually starts off surprisingly strongly. I mean, for almost forty minutes this is close to my favorite of the franchise. Jason has become a vagabond fighter, wandering the armpits of Central Europe as an underground boxer, dead to the world because of the realization at the end of The Bourne Ultimatum that he volunteered to become the assassin he ran away from in the first movie. His only objective is to hide. In Greece, Nicky Parsons tracks him down right after she hacked the CIA and got files about Treadstone, Blackbriar, and the newest form of the black on black ops that succeeded them. She gets him to meet her near the center of a riot in progress in Athens at night, and Greengrass managed the single best sequence in the entire franchise, bar none. I mean, I adore the Moscow chase in The Bourne Supremacy and the Waterloo sequence in The Bourne Ultimatum, but the technical execution of the riot in Athens is flat out amazing.There's never any feeling that the edges of the frame aren't spilling with chaos. Fires, crowds, tear gas, and troops are all always populating the frame around the characters as they try to move through and out. All the while, of course because this is a Jason Bourne movie, the CIA is watching and trying to track Nicky and Jason while they send another assassin in. The controlled chaos as Jason walks in, steals a motorcycle, rides around, picks up Nicky, and rides out, all while an incredibly realistic portrait of rioting chaos erupts around them is amazing.And then the movie trips. You see, Jason has no reason for getting involved in this movie's plot. He has no motivation to try and rip down the CIA again, so they have Nicky die, killed by the assassin. As soon as I saw this coming, I felt like I was watching a Death Wish sequel where increasingly tenuous relationships to Charles Bronson get beat up by local thugs which lead to Bronson deciding to clean up the streets. Nicky was never a close connection to Jason after his amnesia. There were implications in The Bourne Ultimatum that the two had a romantic relationship before Jason lost his memory, but this Jason never felt it, rebuffing the idea of even revisiting it because he was still consumed by the loss of his own love Maria. So, Nicky, a person he's met about three times in his entire living memory and hasn't seen or heard from in about six years, suddenly dying feels like really poor justification for his decision to get back into this game. It's thin, and it doesn't work.It's about here in the film where another major problem develops: there are simply too many stories floating around. A lot of this is rooted in Greengrass's desire to turn this into a topical social commentary, but he doesn't integrate it with the narrative particularly well.So, the CIA story is told through the eyes of Heather Lee, an ambitious young cybersecurity guru who uses Nicky's hack as a way to make herself seen and known to Robert Dewey, the CIA Director. She heads the operation to track down the hacker and then Bourne. The assassin is The Asset, and he is possibly the source of some of the worst of this movie. It's not that Vincent Cassel is bad (though he does feel a little old to be an active duty deadly assassin), it's that they shoehorn him into yet another series of flashbacks for Bourne that is designed to alleviate Jason of his guilt for choosing to join Treadstone. You see, the CIA killed Jason's father right after Jason was offered the post, but Jason's father actually conceived of the program himself and was going to talk him out of it. The murder of Jason's father was designed to convince Jason to join. This is designed to absolve Jason of the guilt he had been accumulating, but everything about it, his father, his father's place in the CIA, his father's design of Treadstone, and The Asset's hand in the murder are all simply too much when it comes to late franchise additions to Bourne's past. The Asset's hand in the murder is the worst part, trying to give Jason some kind of emotional connection to The Asset to play out in a final fistfight that, because everything came so quickly and so late and so thinly, ends up feeling flat.The action moves to London where Jason tries to track down a former CIA analyst who had connections with his father, but things go awry, of course, putting Heather in The Asset's sights as well as Bourne when she begins to turn on Dewey. The CIA Director, at the same time, is trying to expand an Internet spying program with a Google-like company that they helped set up while the CEO of said company is getting cold feet. This is the part of the film that feels the most removed from everything (even though the third act literally revolves around it) and the reason that Greengrass decided to make the movie. It's the most socially conscious part of the film, and it is a couple of major steps removed from the central (and title!) character's motives.Why does Jason Bourne go to Las Vegas? Pretty much because the move demands it. Bourne stops having motives in this movie pretty much the moment he meets the former CIA analyst in London. The movie needs to go to Las Vegas for a gun fight and a car chase right after some speechifying about Internet freedom, so he does.Everything from this point is perfunctory at best. The action scenes are as well filmed as anything, but they're empty exercises in technique. Jason's fistfight with The Asset feels tacked on. The Internet freedom stuff seems to come from another movie (the one that Greengrass seems to have wanted to make instead of all the other stuff).Really, this movie just completely falls apart after a certain point, torn apart by several different stories going in different directions, new backstories that feel regressive narratively, and a whole bunch of computer wizardry that had my cybersecurity wife frustrated at from beginning to end. But, holy crap, that first thirty minutes is kind of awesome. It definitely doesn't hold the rest of the movie up, but it does stand on its own. Just turn off the movie once Nicky gets shot, and you'll be happy."

",0.0,0.6956,2020-10-06 00:00:00,6,"As a massive fan of the James Bond franchise, I have always seen Jason Bourne as the perfect antidote to the 007 hiatuses. We've had imaginative titles, courtesy of Robert Ludlum, such as The Bourne Identity; The Bourne Supremacy; and The Bourne Ultimatum - each chapter with a similar plot, an ex-CIA operative with severe memory loss trying to rediscover his past and seek revenge for those who manipulated him. However, after the series' own hiatus, and after the disappointing spin-off chapter, The Bourne Legacy, with Jeremy Renner, which, for all intents and purposes, may as well disappear, comes the unimaginatively titled re-boot, Jason Bourne. This film teams Matt Damon (Bourne) with director, Paul Greengrass, a collaboration which lasted through Supremacy and Ultimatum. So, then, a tried and tested recipe for success? No. This really is Groundhog day. Trying to remember anything really distinctive or eye-opening about this film is a challenge. I was led to think that I was the amnesiac, not Jason Bourne. The only recurrence in the film that I welcomed was the incredibly catchy Bourne theme over the end titles, Extreme Ways, by Moby, which never gets old. Perhaps the film could have redeemed itself with its high-octane car chase on the Las Vegas strip, but the editing was so fast that the sequence was more headache-inducing than visually satisfying."

Unlike the other famous spy from the initials J.B., the character out of Robert Ludlum's books was someone who could really exist.

With his documentary-style camera in hand and his concern for what was going on in the world, he influenced a generation of action filmmakers. Here, the duo incorporates elements of today, such as cyber espionage and world instability after the economic crisis of 2008 in a plot that resumes the good times of the series.Off the radar as a street fighter, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is surprised by Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), who seeks him out by offering new information about his past. Initially resistant, he ends up returning to the United States to continue the investigation and is targeted by former chief Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), who fears yet another data leak. Inside the CIA, however, newcomer Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) believes that trying to recruit Bourne for the agency is the best solution.In his first films, Jason Bourne seeks to know his past and, mainly, who he was. For that, he ends up investigating an absurd operation built by the CIA, Treadstone, which was intended to command first-rate assassins to complete political missions favoring the United States. In the meantime, the character ends up poking the hornet in such a deep way that there is no turning back. Upon discovering the operations commander and exposing the truth to the public, it seemed that Bourne had fulfilled his role and that he could now move on, but no ... and this new film works on that idea.Like many soldiers when they return from the war and can no longer lead a normal life, Jason Bourne outlines a kind of half-life that escapes reality. The character finds himself without any perspective, doing only what is necessary to try his hardest to disconnect from his life as a murderer. The film clearly demonstrates that Bourne is trying at the same time to hide from everyone who wants to kill him, and also to stay out of trouble so that he no longer needs to hurt innocent people.Nine years after the Bourne Ultimatum, the last film in the first trilogy, times have changed completely. We live in an era where technology is the basis for obtaining all knowledge and information in a quick and easy way. In addition to the usual conspiracies and tours in different countries, the feature brings current discussions, such as the issue of security x privacy, which makes the story a little closer to the viewer, even if this is not the focus. A place where social networks create profiles of practically everyone in the world, who know where we are, have been and will be. The feature features privacy concepts for the connected user, coupled with the ideas that a social network allows you to be watched at all times. In two moments of the film, Edward Snowden, an American considered a traitor who made public important documents that addressed a global surveillance program of the American Intelligence, is mentioned, which attunes the viewer to the idea of the new government programs. To what extent is it moral or not that the government has access to this data? Unfortunately, the feature falls into the American cliché of freedom and patriotism. Instead of adding to that discussion, it just shows us all the arguments we've seen before. The whole arc involving Aaron Kalloor, the CEO of Deep Dream, and his doubts about the morality of handing over access to the CIA is very poorly explored.It is also interesting to check the generation shock within the CIA itself, where the director still acts the old fashioned way, while Heather, (Alicia Vikander) pupil of the director and a mysterious girl who has the profile of a double agent, uses technology to her advantage, causing occasional conflicts in the plot.
Jason Bourne's exquisiteness lies in the character's maturation. Nine years after his last official adventure, since Renner's feature is ignored, Matt Damon knew how to show the weight of age in Bourne. Less agile and more strategist, his ploys to take down the villain are well elaborated. With fewer lines and more observer, the agent has his skills revamped as well as the action scenes directed by Paul Greengrass who manages to propose something new to so many films of the genre. Speaking of action, the film delivers what it promises, it has all the elements that we saw in the previous ones: the choreography, scenes of tension, the camera that can't stand still, everything is there. But without getting boring or repetitive, it manages to keep you very excited in the cinema. In addition to Damon, we realize that Heather Lee, played by Alicia Vikander, is one of the new characters featured in the feature. She is intriguing, extremely intelligent and an essential feature in the plot. From the first moment she appears on the scene, you can see that there are many more layers to Heather than the one she lets on. The actress is one of the highlights of the plot.From Iceland to Las Vegas, through Athens and London, the plot features Bourne (Damon) trying to recall his past as he tangles behind the scenes of the filth of the CIA director (Tommy Lee Jones) and the secret agent to whom he entrusts his missions. excuses (Vincent Cassel). A point for Greengrass and broker-dealer Christopher Rouse: the villain is the US government itself, and the good guy, his persecuted foe, in an inversion of the logic to which Hollywood has accustomed the contemporary public. This fourth part does not lose anything in the adrenaline. The feeling of imminent risk is constant and the director manages to pass a tension with characters who are deliberately calm and not very expressive. The cuts in the action scenes are very well thought out. The rhythm of the film is tireless, always making the protagonist jump from one tense situation to another. This helps to make sure that the audience does not have time to blink during the fighting, nor to question the points where the script is not so well worked, being in constant motion and allowing the ellipses of time to pass almost unnoticed.The initial half hour is filled with a frantic chase involving motorbikes and cars through the streets of Athens - having trouble filming Jason Bourne in Greece, Universal rebuilt streets in the capital of that country, Athens, occupied by thousands of extras, in the Spanish city of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. This sequence culminates in the death of an important character, who is also the starting point for the whole plot of this fifth chapter of the franchise.We still have interesting sequences in London and the big highlight goes to the third act in Las Vegas. That's where the thing gets going in a frantic way. Greengrass returns to, once again, leave that good old trademark of the films of the franchise: An absolutely incredible car chase. The scene in question shows a Swat car driven by Asset being chased by a sedan, driven by Jason. Together, they devastate the city where the elite US police car destroys everything and paves the way wherever it goes - it is a bit exaggerated, but extremely exciting. As a matter of curiosity, the Las Vegas chase sequence took five weeks to film. In total, 170 cars were destroyed by the production, which was only allowed to occupy the city streets from 0 am to 6 am. As if that were not enough, the chase ends in a visceral struggle between both - and detail - with bruises that remain. Here, you seem to feel every punch and all the pain that the characters feel. There is something somewhat cathartic about seeing a car falling apart during a collision with another. These are scenes in which practically nobody gets hurt, but the trail of destruction left is remarkable.Jason Bourne is a film that has modernized, used elements of today to contextualize the viewer, touched critical points in society, but it still had the true DNA of the first trilogy, where the spy / ex-assassin more 'badass' of planet continues to seek the truth and, in its own way, protect citizens from the hands of those who intend to rule the world. Paul Greengrass's direction delivers exactly what fans expect in terms of action, even if the script has some slips. He is competent enough to make the public not want to forget that character, but it is not the best film in the Bourne franchise."

The 2016 version of ""Jason Bourne"" is all computerized and digitalized, modern technique dominates the whole picture, and all the actors in it are experts on it, especially Matt Damon, Bourne himself, and his relentless persecutor and chief Tommy Lee Jones, who has aged into almost a wreck during the last 30 years, but he is still the same and acts as well as ever. The story this time is highly international and can vie with James Bond in its spread of chaos around the world in highly advanced and sophisticated techniques, but never gets lost but sticks to its main problem: Bourne's doubts as to his calling, in which his father now is involved by his traumatic death. Bourne is an agent in top standing with the CIA, which he tries to cut ties with, which his bosses won't let him, since he knows too much and is too clever, so if he doesn't return they feel they have to ""put him out"". They try desperately, but ultimately no problem is solved, and the case continues, preparing the way for new films in the same line.There is a bit too much happening at the same time, it's difficult to follow all the twists and turns around constant turmoil in the wake of Bourne's course, but if you can follow, the film is interesting.

Back in the day the Bourne trilogy basically usurped Bonds title as top spy franchise. It was fresh it was modern. The fight choreography and car chases and total feel of the movies made it a must see. This resulted in Craig being cast as the new Bond with an edge. The Bond franchise upped its game completely challenging Bourne for supremacy (excuse the pun) again. Bourne disappeared and the ending of him floating in the rice felt a fitting end to the hero. Now his return unfortunately feels dated. It can't compare to the John Wicks of this world and even recent Bond movies. There were some great moments such as the Vegas car chase and some great characters like Vincent Cassel but these were few. The fight scenes from previous Bourne movies were original and thrilling, these seemed tired and clunky. The plot was pure cheese and I found myself not caring really about Bourne. The female CIA agent was a really annoying character also. I just think this was a real shame and has somewhat ruined my nostalgic memories of a really great hero and movie franchise."

There's a lot to love, the photography and Greengrass' direction, Nicky Parson's genuinely scared face. But the super-soldier amnesiac, globe-trotting, and slam-bang action always rode the fine line between blockbuster thrills and indie realism, and with each film it seemed to veer more in to the gloss and contrivance and cliche of hollywood blockbuster, and Jason Bourne veers palpably close to jumping the shark.
Bourne is now full emo, illegally punching dudes for no good reason other to wear the 'emotionally damaged' buff hero moniker shorthand; there's some hamfisted 'current' hacking and leaking that mostly revolves around computer systems that look way too advanced and visual and unrealistic for the government, and the action feels more like practised professional's expected interludes rather than electric out-of-place interjections.
Alicia Vikander And Tommy Lee Jones are emotionless husks and as foils, not a patch on the prior CIA incarnations. It's painfully clear there's no good reason for everyone to be back, and despite all being on top form, Jason Bourne is missing Tony Gilroy's magic way of folding character and intrigue inbetween the action and the code-talk."

Nevertheless, Jason Bourne doesn't quite live up to the expectations of the original Bourne trilogy, so franchise-wise, this movie is only beneficial if you really are craving more Bourne. Even then, think twice about it.The movie contains a few flaws in terms of plot holes and excessive shaky cam, so viewers picky or sensitive to those elements might find this movie a bit below average. Still, just like The Bourne Legacy, it features acceptable action sequences and is time to time fairly exciting in between the tedious plot expositions.

But this time - I didn't buy it.
It lacked the personality, the character development and the writing. The Vegas chase was definitely impressive to look at but other than that the script was ruined by cliches and tech nonsense. When do writers start to reach out to security experts who can tell them especially what is NOT possible? It's frustrating to see them getting away with agencies being able to hack about anything, within seconds, using fancy interfaces and laughable, bespoke terminal window commands. You can write your way out of about anything!
The chases weren't as interesting this time and felt they were there just to keep us busy. People staring at flat monitors and yelling things like ""block exit A"" or ""Deploy Bravo Team"" gets repetitive fast and silly.Also, the flashbacks that conveniently pop up in Bournes head based on whatever character motivation should keep this story moving is tiring.I think what essentially bothered me most is that the story was simply over already and this movie had no reason to exist. Bourne is Matt Damon, but for any future installments of this film, side storylines with new characters and more interesting plot devices will be needed, or else just stop!

You know that scene where they jump a car from one tower block to the next. You roll your eyes in pity of the lack of intelligent writers and accept the pure action movie.Well that wasn't how Bourne used to be. Bourne used to be an intelligent franchise.Used to be."
" A decent continuation in the franchise
",0.0,0.5423,2019-07-05 00:00:00,8,Anyone who has seen the original trilogy will simply straightaway feel comfortable when it starts like an old blanket. The movie covers the same formula as before just with different actors. The only addition is some background on Jason's dad and his apparent involvement in the recruitment of his son. The end even leaves open a possible continuation in the franchise which surprised me as I assumed that Matt Damon would insist that the character be killed off.

" A Boring and Unintelligent Sequel
",-0.6486,0.1779,2019-06-24 00:00:00,3,The same plot as the other three Bourne movies. Which is just stale at this point. If nothing new is being done then what is the point of making a sequel in the first place. The first borne movie to feel stale mostly because in the other 3 there were interesting characters to hold up the repetitive plot. Jason Bourne does not have that luxury.

Weren't there people ... families as well as couples ... in all those otherwise unrelated passenger cars destroyed?And the surviving girl in this one turns out to be both ambitious and evil, personally taking out the previous administrator and blackmailing the DNI into making her CIA director.A disturbing detail was CIA Dir Dewey threatening to have the one fellow's family murdered, if he told Bourne the truth about his father ... which the fellow did. It recalls the real-life ""murder-suicides"" of 9/11 whistleblower and former CIA officer Phillip Marshall and his teenage children and even their dog as well as the same of ""The Gray State"" whistleblowing film producer David Crowley, his pretty young wife, and their 5 year old daughter ... and their dog.In sum, it portrays and seems to confirm the CIA as being a profoundly evil cut-throat Deep State bureaucratic jungle."

The fight scenes are so badly filmed it is hard to follow what happens. How does Bourne always have the right keys to doors he has never seen before? How does the hitman mage to outpace the motorcycle on foot? Bourne also seems to get shot by Dewey's body guard but there is no sign of blood and he goes on to fight with the hitman as though nothing happened to him. The last scene where Vikander's duplicity is revealed (no indication of how he recorded them as far as I could see) seems to foretell another sequel. Let us hope it is much better than this but I think the franchise has outlived its usefulness."
" No Revival Here...Hollywood Killed It In The Worst Way
",-0.8957,0.8942,2019-05-05 00:00:00,5,"Frankly I'm predisposed to snark at the Hollywood bombast used to ramp up the cat and mouse game between Jason Bourne and the director's minions. It gets too ridiculous too often. Like the ""control room"" seeing virtually everything during the big demonstration chaos in Rome. Not just that but putting ""the asset"" right into the center of the hunt without so much as traffic jam. Good spy intrigue shouldn't insult one's intelligence when it is suppose to be being played straight.The most compelling thing is how low the agency will go to get Bourne. Tommy Lee has never been more of a rat. His character believes in total state surveillance without any care for how it squashes that old American virtue of Freedom. So with a knowledge things will be ridiculous you watch to see how Borne outfoxes the director and his dark agenda. It's really not enough and Damon's Bourne isn't either. This movie needs to jettison the Hollywood overkill. I like my supposed real spy stories to feel reel and not cartoonish. Yeah lots of money has been thrown at this continuation of the Jason Bourne story and instead of getting grounded in realism it's pure fantasy as presented. It's a fail because the character could have been made more real instead of whatever dreck this is. Please someone give us a good fictional spy flick that we can invest in because it feels possible every step of the way. This certainly ins't that. It's a Hollywood hack job. Even when Bourne lives he dies because they've ruined the character with a stupid over the top screenplay."

So, I stopped watching.Overall, I don't like this film and thus, I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it."
" not as good as the previous 3 sequels
",-0.3412,-0.8131,2019-04-11 00:00:00,8,"I am bit disappointed. Although we have the same main actor, unlike in Bourne Legacy, and few other same actors and some other actors I think I recognized from some other movies, they are too old, tired, ugly, and not the same anymore. Although they still had some energy in them, there is noticable forced acting, and lack of interest. They must have forgotten their original acting and story. Had they made this movie much earlier, it would be perfect. The good side of this movie is extreme action and stints. Swat, police, hacking, chasing, shooting, all that any action movie should have. And it's all done in our current time, no old things. I did not like that that girl died too early just like that too. And these 2 girls could make story progress in much more details and sequels, but there is no romanticism unfortunately. Bit too extreme, harsh, and abusive movie. Maybe just as good as The Bourne Legacy, but not as good as 1st 3 sequels with actor Matt."

This time it must be proper, regarding the previous nonsense of the universe. Now Matt Damon is at the helm, so the ship should conquer even the wildest storm.It is extremely easy to overcome the remains of the franchise, burnt by the 4th part, but in this fallout we still have memories of good old times. Saying this I was pleasantly surprised following brisk and youthful pace of the movie. Although as always, the reasons of Jason's return have been tailored by a ten-year-old, I focused only on the RETURN.Remembering last parts I didn't expect this to one to jump right into the action, which stops only because the movies have a limited time. Following the events, I couldn't stop admiring the well-rounded approach to everything: fighting, chasing, hiding and connecting present to the past.Matt Damon didn't show any sign of getting older: in that scene of shooting on the run he might have sent a bullet right into my heart, cause now I genuinely admire him. On the contrary, the weird touch was given by Riz Ahmed that kind of put the ""cliché"" label after the second ""innovative billionaire"" role on his account.Don't know whether this is caused by warm feeling of the past or just because 2016 'Jason Bourne' is an awesome movie, but one thing should be said: the franchise has been fantastic and groundbreaking; I wouldn't mind watching another sequel... But creators, bear in mind the Bourne is Damon and Damon is Bourne. The man immortalized himself and we have all seen what happens when you replace freshly cooked pasta with some canned atrocity...Even if there will be no continuation, the return of the original spy was sublime and personally I consider it as the best part of all."
" Disappointing compared to the rest
",-0.4939,-0.9766,2019-03-10 00:00:00,3,First of all Alicia Vikander as national head of security(!) is totally ridiculous and not convincing at all. Not saying she's a bad actress but it's just not a good cast she seems way too insecure like a scared little kitten plus she looks like a teenager. The hacking scenes are so cheesy and embarrassing to watch. Camera work is distracting difficult to follow at times action scenes very messy. Worst of all there is no twist nothing this film just goes on and on. Good thing Tommy was in there at least they did that right.
" Another great Bourne film with a contemporary twist.
",0.6249,0.9914,2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Back in 2002, The Bourne Identity redefined not only the action film aesthetic but the modern spy thriller as well. While some elements of the Bourne films have been good for action films, others are now trite and cliché. If you were to break down the ""Bourne formula"", these four elements could be used to make any action film in the ""Bourne-style"":Car chases with spectacular driving in ""common"" vehicles
Brutal hand-to-hand combat using everyday items
Shaky camera movement during action sequences
""The chase"" where eventually the protagonist gets away, achieves his objective and escapes into the shadows once again
Because the Bourne films are so formulaic, I found Jason Bourne (2016) to be no different. That being said, the film was still a fun and intense ride to watch. Now nine years later from the last in the ""true"" Bourne storyline (we'll just forget that The Bourne Legacy (2012) happened), technology has vastly improved, making this film seem more like a crossover of James Bond and Person of Interest. This, I feel, was Jason Bourne's strength. Casting the incomparable Alicia Vikander (hot in her burgeoning career), was a smart choice and made this film enter the ""new era of espionage.""Furthermore, including the subplot focusing on technological privacy pulled straight from our current events helped to pin this film into the collective popular culture in which we now live, instead of just being a series of chases in foreign lands. I also appreciated the inclusion of some semblance of a plot in this film, as it felt like Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) had not gotten very many answers in the last three films. At least this time around we learn something about him and his motivation; since the amnesiac super-soldier archetype can really only go so far.Another great Bourne film with a contemporary twist, I give Jason Bourne 4.0 stars out of 5."

" Misses out on being a Great Spy Thriller
",0.5574,0.9823,2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,"28 July 2016. As a standalone movie, Jason Bourne would have been a good movie, but it's difficult to replicate the originality of the original trilogy. What this newest version has going for it is the fascinating high-tech surveillance backdrop, the decent self-contained plot, and a real trooper in Julia Stiles who again agrees to put in another appearance (albeit surprisingly looking distinctively older). What also stands out unfortunately, is the absence of disguises and what might to considered lazy fight scenes somewhat reminiscent of The Dark Knight (2008). The sharp, stylized, crisp fight scenes from The Bourne Supremacy (2004) are missing. It's debatable whether or not the quick transitions between supposedly emotional scenes are too brief to really offer the audience a sufficiently visceral connection to the characters and relationships. This newest Bourne version however offers up a fascinating chase scene though Las Vegas that brings up ""how did they do that"" in such spectacular fashion, it was a real, creative, fresh take on an old generic scene (yet the use of the SWAT vehicle was probably overly fantastic) and offers up a gritty and powerful mob scenes that are shot in a gripping and authentic manner. The basic structure of this movie was sound, it had chilling thrills, good pacing, yet it seems to omit the necessary care and refinement that could have made this Bourne movie into a great movie."

" Nail-biting and thrilling follow-up with frantic and noisy action from start to finish
",-0.128,0.9982,2018-12-11 00:00:00,6,"You know his name . Matt Damon is Bourne again . Outstanding follow-up and with a similar premise to original movie , including the moving camera work by using efficiently steadycam with numerous European/American locations . In the film there are shootouts , emotion , suspense ,thrills , driving car pursuits and from start to finish the bustling action is unstoppable. It happens years after the happenings of The Bourne Ultimatum, former CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon , his acting as a hard-rock , two-fisted agent is top-notch) resurfaces just as his former employers are implementing a new program aimed at hunting him down. Nowadays , he is utterly recovered from his amnesia, and a decade after he exposed Operation Blackbriar when he was disappeared . Now Jason Bourne has ultimately recovered from his amnesia, isolating himself from the world and making a living by taking part in violent , bare-knuckle fighting bouts in Athens . Meanwhile , in Reykjavík, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), who has been collaborating with a hacktivist group , hacks into the CIA's mainframe computer server to expose its black ops programs . In the process, Parsons finds out documentation regarding Bourne's recruitment into Treadstone and his father's role in the program. She then travels to Athens to meet and inform him.
This alerts Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) , the head of the agency's cyber security operations division, and CIA director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) . Later on, Bourne joins forces with Nicky Parsons to discover the truth behind his father's death and other dark secrets , but both of them suffer a hot pursuit .This exciting follow-up packs intrigue , emotion , frenetic action, crossfire and violent fights . This installment is an astonishing following with similar premise to former entries . From the beginning to the final the noisy action and fast-movement are unstopped. This is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a tough hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the former films. The picture bears remarkable resemblance to first and third installment , as action as storyline . The movie is longtime , two hours and some , though is neither tiring , nor boring , but entertaining ; and packs a lot of bemusement . Unlike The Bourne Identity: Bourne case (2002), screenwriters Christopher Rouse and Paul Greengrass read the book this time and claimed that he did a re-imagination, not a particular adaptation, of the novel . Rouse wrote an original script using key elements and roles from the novel as a framework, though he replaced the traditional Carlos The Jackal-type villainous with Asset/Vincent Cassel .Matt Damon interpretation is excellent as a hard and strong spy without identity , while simultaneously exacting vengeance and evading the government forces hot on his trail. Alicia Vikander is cool as expert agent Heather Lee who finally helps Bourne . Both of whom carry out dangerous action scenes . Matt Damon and Julia Stiles are the only actor and actress from the original trilogy to reprise their roles as Jason Bourne and Nicky Parsons, respectively. While David Strathairn, Joan Allen, and Edward Norton's characters are still living when we last see them, they are never spoken of, or referenced . Very good support cast plenty of familiar faces such as : Vincent Cassel , Julia Stiles , Riz Ahmed , and , of course, the always great Tommy Lee Jones .Musician John Powell composes a stirring , rousing soundtrack . Adequate and colorful cinematography in semi-documentary style by Barry Ackroyd and steadicam and there are several locations : Reykjavik , Athens , London , Berlin , Las Vegas . The motion picture was well directed by Paul Greengrass ,though it has a real likeness to the previous entries . This is a thrilling fourth part completing perfectly the splendid quartet . The motion picture lavishly produced was professionally realized by Paul Greengrass . Producer Frank Marshall selected Paul Greengrass as director after he'd seen Paul's Bloody Sunday (2002). Marshall was after a filmaker who wasn't intrinsically associated with the action genre, feeling that Greengrass would impart an original focus of his own to the screenplay , as Paul wrote and directed the previous ¨Bourne supremacy¨ and subsequently he directed this ¨Jason Bourne¨. Greengrass became a great director of action and thriller movies, such as United 93 , Green Zone , and Captain Phillips .The Ludlum's novel have also spawned a television series and several more books ; other films of this exciting saga are the followings : First TV recounting 1998 ' The Bourney identity' with Richard Chamberlain , Jaclyn Smith . The cinematic first rendition was 'The Bourne Identity' (2002) by Doug Liman with Damon , Julia Stiles , Franca Potente , 'Bourne supremacy' 2004 by Paul Greengrass with Damon and Franca Potente , ¨Bourne ultimatum¨ by Paul Greengrass with Damon , Edgar Ramírez , David Strathairn , Scott Glenn , Paddy Considine , screenplay by Tony Gilroy. And a spin-off : The Bourney Legacy¨ with Jeremy Renner , Rachel Weisz , in which the deeds in this film take place at the same time during the events in the previous movie ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", thus making this picture a peculiar continuing to the Bourne trilogy , here an undercover agent and a Doctor are pursued around the world in a relentless chase . Rating : Acceptable , passable , and decent sequel , well worth seeing . The movie will appeal to thriller fans and suspense lovers . Rating: 6.5/10 . Good . Well woth seeing ."

Just silly.In the original Bournes the only supernatural
skills where personal Bourne skills, ingenuity, foresight etc.Also I like Alicia Vikander but she is terribly miscast in this. A very young women, seemingly in charge of operations, technology, missions etc in the CIA. Just not realistic. The older woman in the early movies was much more convincing.The over repeated plot line of Bourne trying to know his past is rather overdone and a bit tedious.Some fun action though and Matt Damon is always good."

",0.0,0.8562,2018-11-08 00:00:00,2,"When I saw this title pop up on Netflix and noticed that it starred Matt Damon, I figured I'd check it out. I was a big fan of the original trilogy, and despite the bad reviews, I figured how bad could it really be? It's got some of the original case, as well as some new reputable actors. Well, as it turns out, it really is that bad.
It's hard to believe they convinced Damon to come back for this, although it appears his acting is being done at gun point, and I'm not referring to the plot. Julia Stiles was so flat that I actually thought her lines were dubbed. Not sure what is up with Alicia Vikander's ""accent"", I just found it hard to understand what she was saying.
The dialogue sounds like it was written by a thirteen year old. It would be interesting to count how many times the terms ""asset"" and ""copy that"" are used in the first thirty minutes. I wouldn't know beyond this because this is when I stopped watching.
As others have mentioned, the shaky camera effect is really annoying and overdone. Despite the fact that I was watching this on a 4"" iphone screen, I had to frequently look away because it was making me nauseous.
I had a few laugh out loud moments, like when Vikander was somehow able to delete computer files using a landline telephone from the other side of the planet, or when the hacker character randomly just decided to attack Bourne for no reason. I guess the director felt like there couldn't be more than two minutes without someone getting punched or clubbed with something.
If you like lots of explosions then the first thirty minutes should float your boat. Virtually every second of the scene in Athens has some kind of explosion happening, which even still can not distract from the fact that the plot and acting sucks.
I can only recommend this film if you need to kill thirty minutes. If you have more time to waste than that, you really should find something more productive to do with it.
The only reason I gave this film two stars is because I have seen worse."

Now since it reprises new characters we can tolerate.Usual Bourne films are filled with mystery and JB or Jason Bourne was never a story driven character, he survives. Like the viewer of the film character himself is confused makes it a mutual experience.Now this is deviated in the new installment. He gets to remember things and he becomes obsessed with finding his past, and true.... that is what anyone would do.But the problem is when you go revealing the past we need old characters and we less in this movie, but what we see is a whole new universe of CIA and global espionage. Which previous films never had. JB never was a hero. He was a runner.Here he becomes idealistic a more objective driven. And yet the film concludes with no answers.Action sequences lacked the uniqueness the prior films had. More like watching a typical action film Like ""Taken (2008)"".Anyway it's JB he survived things for 2 decades giving the viewers the thrill of a lifetime and this deviation is not a big deal.But it really screwed the stories arc.Hope they'll recover the story in coming installments.Overall - 3.5/5"

This movie is very similar to the second movie in how he is involved in the plot so expect to get a feeling of laugh deja vu. How they differentiate it is they made the story even more personal to him. I was bewildered as to how the lies surrounding him, within the movie CIA, were just taken as fact. It was if nobody even read any of the case files surrounding the actual events of the series plot. I was hoping to see Pam in this movie since she was an excellent character from the earlier movies but they didn't have a problem finding a capable female lead, and man was she viscious. This movie may have been the same formula which made the first three movies incredible but that doesn't make this movie bad or less than. It is absolutely worth a watch if you are a fan of the series. It also makes me want to read the books the films are based on. I really hope they don't take 9 years to make the next entry, Matt Damon isn't getting any younger and the long time between films is why it probably didn't get such a good reception. The one thing I didn't like about the movie is the main spy/goon. In all the other films they all had at least some depth, they were written in ways that made them at least believeabke movie spies. In this movie he started out as a believable spy but as the flick went on he was basically just a psycho murderer. He was walking around murdering people in very unstealthy manners in some scenes in plain view of the public. At least they didn't write Bourne in that way thankfully. Again, definitely check this movie out."

The whole thing seems really predictable! Seriously, who could not have seen the shooting of Nicky Parsons on the motorbike by a sniper on the roof (same stuff launches the second film). What about the car chase finishing in a last great push of the big SWAT truck on Bourne's car? So many other telephoned scenes that did not make them elegant reminders of the serie but rather good old recipes mixed together in one big coffin-cocktail to me!We could also talk about the characters, but I'll leave you the pleasure to mock Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent Cassel and Alicia Vikander who all three have zero personnality in this movie.It is not a terrible movie, but it certainly is not a good one either.

" There Isn't an Original Bone in This Film's Body, But It's Still a Fun Action Thriller
",0.6777,0.9738,2018-08-07 00:00:00,7,"I don't get the hate for this film. It was fun, with plenty of cool fights and two absolutely incredible car chases (one in Greece and one in Las Vegas, where Matt Damon and Vincent Cassel practically demolish the Strip). Director Paul Greengrass's notorious shaky-cam shots were toned down substantially by my reckoning; I could always tell what was going on, and the direction was quite straightforward. If anything, THAT's the issue with ""Jason Bourne"": it's kinda plain, kind of ""been there, done that."" Absolutely nothing unique or original happens in terms of plot, and there even seems to be a bit of retconning going on in an effort to add more secrets to Bourne's past. There's a halfhearted attempt to add some metaphorical meat to this mostly empty-headed action romp by inserting actor Riz Ahmed into the proceedings; he's a Mark Zuckerberg-type who secretly received funding from CIA goon Tommy Lee Jones when his company was just a startup. This subplot ultimately goes nowhere, providing only a facile, skin-deep exploration of privacy and security themes that were explored far better in previous Bourne flicks (especially ""The Bourne Ultimatum"").I do agree with critics that Tommy Lee Jones's performance is listless and flat, even though it's possible that he's just trying to portray the character as calm and unperturbed under pressure. It's still disappointing, given the fantastic government spooks who have hounded Jason Bourne in previous movies: Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn. Those actors were giving it their all; hard to believe Tommy Lee Jones is here.Alicia Vikander is cool though, sorta-kinda taking Julia Stiles's place as the new young CIA upstart working to track Bourne down. I liked her performance a lot - supremely driven and confident. And Vincent Cassel plays the Asset, an expert assassin tasked with helping the CIA take Bourne down; he plays it straight, and perfectly sells his character as a remorseless killer.At the end of the day, this is an average action movie. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, and yeah - it's weaker than previous Bourne films. But it's hardly the travesty some people have made it out to be. If they do another one, the filmmakers would be wise to get really ambitious and do something truly original - not just with the action setpieces, but with the plot and story as well."

In the first half of the movie things are going to fast,and out of proportion. I want Bourne to fight his way out of all the terrible situations, but at first they can follow every move he makes. The CIA could have done this before, but apparently there had to be a sideline for characters to be taken out of the storyline. Second half is more enjoyable when he's able to make his way out, making the moves we love about him. There are still questions that can lead to another movie, but I hope the scenario of that one will be more thrilling, building up tension and such."

Alicia Vikander is impressive and worth watching out for. Others are also in a top form, and with the screenplay avoiding unnecessary subplots and sticking only to the main plot, this film also impresses on the writing front.Technically, this is a stronger film in the series.

The action sequences are more stylish and top notch, and have been filmed in a way that can make anyone feel like a part of the sequences!While it can be said that overall it's not that great as the trilogy, there's no denying that JASON BOURNE stands out as an example of a masterfully crafted action thriller which improves even more on the best aspects of those movies."

Tired, disinterested, checked out. What dialogue there is, is handled with the kind of unsurety you'd expect from a read-through, and most of the leads sizzle with a kind of barely repressed disdain for each shot. It seems like a movie made in the minutes stolen between takes of a better film, that the actors cared more about, where the script was rushed into their hands shortly after having been written. The color palette is grim, and dour, and whole stretches of the movie are lost to green shadows - the rest is kodachrome washed out, with the sort of gravitas one expects from a handheld vhs recorder. I suspect there was music, but I don't remember a single thing about it. I laughed during the somehow-we're-doing-a-car-chase scene near the finale of the flick, simultaneously evoking the Fast and Furious movies in its relative gaudiness, but also devoid of the charm and style that franchise imparts into its moving pieces. This flick is bleak, bored with itself, and regrettable. I am confident there was a plot, but, again, I dont remember a thing. Just...do not watch this."

" And so what?
",0.0,0.9904,2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"After detouring in the 4th movie, where we discovered that Jeremy Renner took super-hero pills, Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne, reluctantly taking on a CIA which is up to its old tricks again.Nicky Parsons, Bourne's old contact, finds him and tells him that the CIA are still running black ops operations like Treadstone. Though reluctant, Bourne is drawn back into the world he thought he had escaped, and finds himself pitted against Tommy Lee Jones as head of the CIA, Alicia Vikander as an ambitious rising star, and Vincent Cassel as a CIA ""asset"" with a grudge.
Despite having Bourne discover some unknown aspects of his past, and despite there being an ""is she/isn't she?"" aspect to the political machinations of Alicia Vikander's character, there isn't actually a vast amount of plot here. But there is a huge amount of action, much of which is chase sequences - no great surprise there, as far as Greengrass on Bourne is concerned. And it must be said that Greengrass certainly knows how to choreograph a chase sequence - despite the ubiquitous jittercam, it is never difficult to follow what is going on during the chases: the geography of the chaser and chasee is always absolutely clear. If only other jittercam exponents would follow the example!
I felt that the action had been deliberately softened, perhaps in order to get the film a more widely accessible certificate.Damon certainly dealt with the action well, but Bourne has already been on his voyage of discovery and was little more than a cipher here. Alicia Vikander, however, who is rapidly becoming one of my favourite actresses, brings a degree of duplicitous uncertainty to a character who is following her own highly uncertain agenda. And Tommy Lee Jones puts that wonderfully crumpled face to great use as a CIA director managing several difficult and challenging problems.I just wish there had been a bit more story and a bit less chasing."

We have a real void in our lives that we try to fill by consuming all these movies that hollywood keeps rolling out. We spend billions of dollars to fuel this entertainment industry. Sure it's nice to see a great movie, but how many great movies are there really ? Pretty much the same stories are getting churned over and over. It even seems foolish or sad that we buy into all these make believe stories and spend so many hours of our time because we have nothing better to do. I'm just as guilty of it as anyone else. But after watching this poor, poor movie I feel I really have to get a life. If anything I credit to this movie I would say that it is pretty amazing how they do these realistic looking action scenes where dozens of buildings and cars are destroyed in a place like Las Vegas. How they do it I don't know. If it's done on computers it's still amazing it looks so real.Thing is they can really do anything in movies and make it look realistic, but they rarely use this ability to present wonderful & meaningful stories. There's only so much you can be entertained by merely shooting & explosions. Hollywood has a serious creative void and pretty much all the great stories have already been told. Terminator for example, one of the all time great movies, and Back to the Future; the concept of time travel is wonderful and these movies did it great. But there's only so many times you can do it. DC's Legends of Tomorrow is cranking out a whole tv series based on time travel, and it's pretty ok but after seeing several episodes it gets to be a bore. Perhaps if you're a tv/movie junky you never get bored with all this stuff, but for me there's only so much I can take. And after seeing this Jason Bourne I just feel fed up with movies. The other Bourne movies were pretty good, but the only good thing about this last one is that it served as an awakening that I need to get a life. That goes for the vast majority of movies and tv, just a waste of life.Even some of the all time highest rated movies considered as classics like Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas, I don't get it. For me it's total rubbish. Yeah Goodfellas did a nice job portraying the old school Italian New York neighborhood, but otherwise just a bunch of profanity and violence. How great, how legendary. And our society just eats it up and basically glorifies criminals. And we wonder why our world is so violent. President Obama even gave an award to DeNero for such performances. Anyhow, enough ranting I just gotta give movie watching a rest and find something better to do."

Meanwhile, wherever in the world he happens to be, there is a CIA team located minutes away, ready to arrive on scene and shoot him dead.

Thankfully, the film holds up well as an action film in its own right, if you're not comparing it to the other films in the franchise. It starts Bourne, now in his mid-40s, living off the grid in Greece and bare-knuckle boxing for fun/penance. Unbeknownst to him, Nicky (Stiles) has hacked the CIA and copied all their black-ops files, including ""Treadstone"", and finds Bourne to tell him what she's found. From there, the hunt begins!It's kind of like the 'Mission Impossible' and 'Bond' films now, in that if it isn't broke, don't fix it - it's comfortable getting back in touch with the characters and hand-held camerawork that Greengrass uses as Bourne goes around efficiently dismantling the ""bad guys"" - which usually turn out to be rouge CIA operatives. The Asset (Cassel) is sent to ""take care"" of Bourne by Dewey (Jones), the craggy old CIA Director. Heather (Vikander) is the up-and-coming CIA cyber-expert and does well to keep you guessing who's side she's actually on.The fight scenes are fast and furious, the score is great - always pounding away in the background, so you feel like there's never any respite, which there isn't for Bourne - they tick off about six countries, there's an interesting debate on security vs privacy in the digital age, and best of all, the cars chases are exceptional - shot from all different angles, plenty of destruction everywhere and no CGI to be seen!

",-0.2263,-0.906,2017-12-03 00:00:00,2,"Another horrible mess by Director Paul Greengrass.Direction, script, story, action etc are simply dire. Greengrass sinks to new lows in using his 'shakey cam' cinematography. He needs to stop using it in every scene. He should do an Earthquake movie where it may actually be appropriate.Shockingly unwatchable!"
" Incredibly weak and lazy.
",-0.7146,-0.9793,2017-11-29 00:00:00,3,"Disappointed in why Paul Greengrass signed up for this one. The story is incredibly weak and the movie overall seems to be... redundant. My first complaint with this movie is that you feel that the action sequences come first and the story almost is serving that need, instead of the action sequences serving the story. I don't have any problems with the shaky camera - it fits with Bourne having to watch his back all the time and the need to keep moving - but this time around it feels as if Paul Greengrass is doing this just because it's become his thing. It feel contrived, possibly because of the weak story. My second main complaint is the fantasy technology used. Even 10 years ahead things won't work as they are portraited in the movie. Lazy, sloppy writers seek solace in the ability to rely on being able to hack any CCTV camera in the world, or enhancing a blurry mess into a tack sharp focused image of their target, which is impossible if the data isn't there to begin with. Writers have to start working with tech people to vet their ideas! This is not the 90s anymore.Let alone dumb mistakes of opening files that have been infected by malware (non- executable files can't have malware but whatever), exposing their current location multiple times. A tech savvy person who acquired these files to begin with would instruct people to open these files only when the laptop is disconnected from the network. Or at least check the files for issues. Jason Bourne should know as well. Or moronic things like visualizing which devices are inside a room of a total stranger (knowing the exact layout of any given building in the world) and then hacking a phone remotely so it can then be controlled to do other nonsensical things... come on, man. We want to see Jason Bourne's wits! Not tech fantasy that lazy writers can fall back on to solve their little narrative problems.Lastly this movie lacks soul. Matt Damon is disappointing. He has this serious cold smirk on his face for the entire duration of the film, doesn't talk for most of the time. At least the first films were interesting because he had a weakness, a human side, a man in conflict. Just a guy who wanted peace. The girl he met and became his girlfriend... their lives on the run. That was interesting to watch! And it made the action sequences so much more natural. Not 110 minutes full of ""agency is trying to pinpoint and execute Bourne""."

I really enjoyed the comeback of Bourne in action and I also want squeals to be made.To me, if the trilogy deserves 10/10 this one deserves 9/10. If you are a Bourne+action film fan, Stop listening to the too much negative reviews and have a good time with Jason Bourne.I can't say this one is an action masterpiece like The Bourne Ultimatum, But it's a good one. My actual rating for this title is 8/101 extra to welcome back Matt Damon in one of his finest character and I really want this to go on. Also, to counter the too much negative reviews.There is some camera shaking during action sequences and I'm okay with that. This made me feel those actions to be more real."
" editing
",0.0,-0.9114,2017-09-22 00:00:00,5,No where near as good as the first 3 but not bad. The main issue is the horrendous editing. Camera jumping all over the place and cutting rapidly from scene to scene whenever there is any sort of action. If I had motion sickness I probably would have went nuts or puked. Its an unfortunate result of many movies today either CGI'd to death when not needed or editing like this.I completely understand it takes more time more shoots and more money to get it right but those are the movies worth watching again.If you seen the first 3 then yes give this one a one shot just make sure to bring a garbage can if your weak of stomach.

Tommy Lee Jones, looking like he should be in a zombie film, takes over as the agency director. Bourne is underground in a Serbian fight club when he receives information that (plot spoiler) his dad had not only started the program, but was killed by the agency. It is revenge time. Alicia Vikander plays a CIA insider who thinks she can bring Jason in.The tactics are the same. Bourne creates chaos and moves through a panicking crowd like a hot knife through butter. The film includes sniper action, bike chase scenes, a car chase scene that was too long, and no roof top jumping. The film uses modern day issues such as the Snowden release of information and government agencies demanding back doors into privacy. While the film touches on the privacy vs security issue, it doesn't come down on either side. I still like Ultimatum the best.Guide: No sex or nudity. No F-words noted at IMDb, but something that sounded like one was spoken quickly while someone off screen was shouting in Greek."

",0.0,0.9813,2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this film for what it was - a fast moving thriller with bags of action. I certainly do not think it was as lousy as many other reviewers on IMDb. My main gripe was the awful ""song"" which they used over the first part of the credits. How could they choose something so very cheesy? Moby is not a good songwriter just a compiler of sounds. Matt Damon must be rolling in money the franchise has been so successful - I guess one could describe them as modern day Bond movies. When the series started Damon would have been my last choice as an action hero but he has acquitted himself well and I have gained a lot of respect for him as an actor. Alicia Vikander is a real beauty who enhances the movie though it is a stretch to see her as a high tech member of a secret service. Tommy Lee Jones sleepwalks his way through this film as it is the sort of part he has done often before. The action sequences stretch ones belief, particularly the climactic chase. Overall though an entertaining film."

I'm not going to waste more of my time to give a detailed rundown of why it didn't work. As a lot of other reviewers have stated, we just don't find ourselves caring about the main characters. Especially Alicia Vikander, she really needs to work on her American accent. She sounded somewhere between Irish and German if you ask me. And when you add the shaky cam with some of the ridiculously stupid stunts you want to just turn it off."

If you want to get rid of Bourne, find him with the gadgets and destroy him with a precision drone shot. Why all of these chases and fights and shootings and hocus-pocus CIA plots?No suspense, no plot, no story development, just a lot of gratuitous action. Is Matt Damon so hard up for money that he must destroy his reputation appearing in this trash? How could this movie possibly gross over $400 million?"

Alicia Vikander, who I think is a very good actress, is either horrible cast or completely misplays her character as an overachieving upstart, with a distracting accent, who thinks she can bring Borne in or capture him while T.L. Jones watches from above making snarky comments. Car chase scene fail: there is a swat team truck that plows through a street full of cars and literally comes out scratch and dent free. Really?

Just when you think you've seen the ultimate car chase, there's another wilder one. Paul Greengrass does a fine job of directing, though there's some dizzying hand-held camera action that may or may not affect you adversely.Good performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, and, of course Matt Damon, looking quite buff.The story could and should have been stronger, but as pure entertainment, it's great.

Car chases, sneaky beaky spy stuff (with the obvious movie prop ear pieces), the classic bourne battle royal at the end. Yes it's not real world espionage and no, even the most impressive SWAT truck will not cut through traffic like paper, but even so, I think we can admit we all had a good time. Now if only Hollywood would stop being such box office grabbing, greedy b****ards this coulda shoulda woulda been a great movie. I don't know a 12 year old who has followed the Bourne movies from start to finish, so let's just make this a 15 and be done with it. Let's build up a bitter dislike for the bad guy when he kills someone and for gods sake let's have a better end to the final scuffle. Maybe with Jason showing him the pointy end of a knife, instead of a slightly blurry hug, whereby the baddie just gasps and it's all over. There's good stuff here but for money reasons we've had to put up with an expendables 3 watered down version. But even so, solid 7 by my reckoning."
" Yet Another Good Addition to the Bourne Franchise that keeps you entertained with nostalgic elements of the series showcased in a different package
",0.6808,0.9951,2017-07-05 00:00:00,8,"Thanks to YouTube,i suddenly got to know that a Bourne movie is coming and Matt Damon is coming back as Jason. Here my curiosity increased as i was waiting for a movie in the Bourne Series to be watched in theaters that too wanting to see Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass combination to enthrall me again as how The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) did when i saw it.To watch this movie, i would recommend to anyone that they should have watched the first 3 movies in the Bourne Series and at least read about the same in wiki. Why because Jason Bourne (2016) is connected to events which takes place in the first 3 movies ( Identity, Supremacy, Ultimatum).Coming to the Story and Plot of this movie, It follows the similar pattern of CIA, Hacks, Surveillance, Assassins, Fist-Fights, Thrilling Chase Sequences and much more elements which anyone would expect in a Bourne Movie, but the movie keeps you in the Edge Of the Seat till the last moment as this time Bourne is not only evading death, running away from the people who made him a Ruthless Killer and recollecting his past.This time he seeks answers for why, for whom and for what he was recruited to become Jason Bourne from David Webb which also involves Jason more personally this time as stakes are raised a little high this time.The movie begins from Serbian-Albanian Border,travels across Virginia, Athens, Berlin, London and Las Vegas. The movie also focuses, questions and speaks a little about Information Security, Patriotism, Privacy Concerns Of an Individual using Online Resources and Confidentiality of Data.Coming to casting, Matt Damon excels as Jason Bourne and delivers an apt performance throughout the movie. Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Julia Stiles reprising her role as Nicky Parsons perform their duties well to make sure that Bourne and the Movie are going places. The latest addition is Vincent Cassel who now takes avatar as an Assassin tailing on Bourne to close the case.Coming to the Technical Aspects of the movie, Kudos to the Cinematography and Background Score departments as they combine to give the adrenaline feel for this movie be it in Crucial Moments, Action Sequences and most of all the Stunt/Chase sequences.Anyone would be Entertained and Enthralled while viewing the Thrilling/Nail-Biting Chase Sequences which takes place in Athens/Greece. The whole team should be applauded for picturing such a sequence in a best way to make sure the viewers don't feel fatigue while watching the same on big screen.This movie may not be the best in Bourne Series, but the Movie is Definitely Worth Watching in theaters especially for Action Movie Lovers and for the fans of Bourne Series, This is a Must Watch and a Bang for your Buck."
" ""You don't have any idea who you're dealing with.""
",0.0,0.9693,2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"I guess by the preponderance of negative reviews for this film that I wasn't supposed to care for it much, but I actually enjoyed watching it. To be sure, a couple things didn't make sense to me, but that will sometimes happen. The main thing that wasn't made very clear was why Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) turned on the agency. Granted, she didn't care for Director Dewey's (Tommy Lee Jones) methods, but there could have been other ways to work around his interference, and there was. Of course, when it appeared she was questioning his commitment to eliminate Bourne (Matt Damon), all bets were off.I got a kick out of the statement Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed) made to the Deep Dream convention attendees - 'No one will be watching you'. Yeah right. It seems each passing day reveals more and more horror stories of internet surveillance and radically intrusive policies to place more burdens on internet freedom. They all support an early personal decision I made to avoid Facebook, Twitter and the like. Although I'm on this forum, so who knows who's counting the keystrokes? For devotees of the original Bourne Trilogy, this one doesn't appear to rise to the same standard set by the earlier films. I've seen all of them, but so long ago that the comparisons against the film in question here don't stand out as glaringly as some other reviewers state. Besides, I'm not that invested in the characters as some movie watchers, learning as long ago as watching the Bowery Boys, that film continuity is a mixed bag at best when capitalizing on the success of a critically acclaimed franchise."
" Pretty good but was it actually necessary?
",0.4678,0.9466,2017-06-30 00:00:00,8,"Out of the blue and into the black, the Bourne franchise gets another entry by the successful partnership Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass after two movies - Doug Liman commanded the first film. OK, not totally out of the blue because the Hollywood gears run into business and the house must always win just like the casinos, and they wanted more energy (and cash) into the franchise thinking there were ideas to be explored and they couldn't end the whole thing with ""The Bourne Legacy"", which for them was kind of disappointing. They got back Damon, Greengrass, Julia Stiles and Christopher Rouse (editor from previous films and now working as a writer here) and the result was ""Jason Bourne"", you know how things go: fast-paced action, awesome car chases, plot filled with twists, lots of Kung-Fu or Jeet Kune do fighting styles where the camera and the editing ruins the whole thing....but the dramatic arc is always interesting. However, this entry was the lowest in the series - at one time, I was really disappointing with ""The Bourne Supremacy"" - which by the way, this film has plenty of similar plot points and it's almost a copy - but I gave a second chance and end up liking it. As usual, Bourne disappears and then gets tracked by Langley and the CIA folks. Their mission is always the same: terminated the man who at the same time knows too much but in fact knows too little about his life and murders as a trained special agent. This time, a CIA director (Tommy Lee Jones, in a sort of self parody of Sam Gerard character) and one young curious analyst (Alicia Vikander) are trying to find him with help of a deadly killer (Vincent Cassel). Meanwhile, Jason gets more and more news about his past, memories are coming back and he discovers that some really closer to him was the one who put in this dangerous situation. There's some other characters in between such as the high-tech pro (Riz Ahmed), who feels like a mixture of Snowden and Zuckerberg, who has ties with the Agency and now wants to get rid of them because he's launching a new social media that doesn't follow its users - bad idea for Langley. If that was a social commentary about our times, I gotta tell you, it wasn't clever enough to hold a relevance. It wouldn't be fair of me to say Mr. Greengrass didn't come up with exciting sequences and nice dramatic sequences, because he actually got some sauce in there and it was special - the whole tense hotel convention was amazing; and there's one death scene I can't reveal here - what a shocker. But for the majority of the film he couldn't sustain a decent shot (as usual in his career, when will this man ever learn? He acknowledge in one audio commentary for another film that he does the shaky camera thing which people hate it but he loves it - the Vegas chase sequence was so boring that I almost hated it) ; neither an important dramatic device that can make audiences feel as if seeing something slightly new in the series. When the revelations start to come you either think it's predictable or you'll go like ""Ooh...meh, it wasn't all that cool"". It's not a total disaster because Tommy Lee always manages to play a good ""hunter"" - basically the villain here; and Vikander excelled with dignity and presence as the agent who might see things in a different way and most likely to become a supporter of Bourne. However, the script managed to leave Damon absent from most of the sequences and he doesn't speak much - it's almost they're trying to make an art-house action film for him. That was weird. Despite the load of criticism, I liked the film. It was nice seeing Damon returning (despite the age, those boxing scenes at his first moments actually show how much he aged but he still can get it), I was involved in the dynamics that involved Bourne's acts and how he used everything on his favor - though the ultimate revelation to form his identity wasn't any supremacy in cinematic terms (the trilogy got it so much better and should have stopped there). It was fine and manageable. You'll have lots of fun with it. But Greengrass cannot film a fighting scene without cutting each time a punch or kick goes by, definitely destroying martial arts. Those are arts man, and art was meant to be seen and not felt each frame goes by because it ruins the spectacle. And my message to Universal: stop right now and no reboot is acceptable at this time. Grow some brains and embrace new ideas and writers, you won't regret. 8/10"
" Not worth caring about
",-0.5096,-0.9847,2017-06-28 00:00:00,2,"I shall make some general points as the film does not repay close examination. 1- presumably it is meant to connect with the previous two Matt Damon Bournes, but I don't see it. 2 - good cinematography, but the hand-held camera gets old very fast and the chase scenes hold the interest for less than half their length. 3 - who is meant to be the villain? Does the villain even appear in the film? It's lazy to assume the audience will just go along with rooting against Evil Faceless Gibbermint. 4 - anyone spot any real suspense or tension? Difficult to claim spoiler warnings for a script that runs on tramlines all the way to the failure to resolve anything."

" Better than expected but even more pointless than 'The Bourne Legacy'
",0.2382,0.9937,2017-06-21 00:00:00,5,"It wasn't until fairly recently when finally getting round to watching the original Bourne trilogy, after being behind with my film watching for various reasons and not being sure as to whether they'd be my cup of tea.The good news was that they left me with the sense of how on earth did it take so long to see them. Really liked 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' and loved 'Ultimatum', even if neither were one hundred percent perfect and had a couple of flaws between them while having a vast number of strengths. Expectations were low for 'The Bourne Legacy', and while it was nowhere as bad as feared it left me feeling what was the point when it really should have stopped at 'Ultimatum'.Judging from the relatively mixed reviews, there was the uncertainty as to how 'Jason Bourne' was going to turn out. Despite Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass returning, again the point of it was questioned and there was the worry as to whether it was going to lose a lot of what was so great about the original trilogy.Finally seeing 'Jason Bourne', like 'The Bourne Legacy', it was better than expected and there are good things. However, even with the involvement of Damon and Greengrass what worked so well before is lost here and it is even more pointless than 'Legacy'.Starting with the good things, there are moments where the film has a slick and stylish look with great locations. Some of the action is exciting and fun as well as tense.Damon makes a very welcome return and is one of the not so many elements that still work, bringing steel, authority and vulnerability to a role that was originally quite a departure from his previous roles. Alicia Vikander acquits herself well being sympathetic and with guts. Vincent Cassell has an underwritten role but is still awesome, dripping with menace.However, Tommy Lee Jones has the most underdeveloped character of the film, and perhaps the most clichéd and dullest character of all five films put together. He's a talented actor but does nothing with the role and looks disinterested.Greengrass' direction doesn't work this time round. There is very little tension or thrills, and while the camera work and editing weren't as big as made out in the previous films (but there were times where the hand held shaky cam did distract) it is very excessive in 'Jason Bourne', so much so that the worst of it should have come with a seizure inducing warning, speaking as an epileptic parts did make me feel nauseous.Writing here is even less intelligent and sharp than 'Legacy' and there isn't any hint of subtlety in sight, some of it is talky and muddled. The story is not just convoluted and too reliant on the action (enough of it working but the thrills and fun don't come consistently), but there are big pacing issues, with some scenes going on for too long and others feeling rushed.In summary, not awful but not particularly good and leaves one questioning is there a point to all this. Promised a lot, didn't deliver enough and a significant drop in quality from the original trilogy. Of course it should stand on its own two feet, it is just hard to not compare when the difference in quality is so drastically vast. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
" I really wish I hadn't watched this film!
",0.5081,0.9774,2017-06-11 00:00:00,4,"I absolutely love the original trilogy and have watched them all numerous times. This film is not just nowhere near as good as them, it actually goes some way to ruining the original films. Bourne is almost unrecognisable from the character in the first films, and this is never more apparent than one of the films ""important"" final scenes near the end with Tommy Lee Jones' character. As a stand alone action film it is average and relatively entertaining. But in all honesty I wish I had never watched this film as it really does sour the excellent original trilogy. I would have much preferred another instalment of the legacy films, as at least that was heading off in it's own direction.I would caution fans of the original to avoid this film at all cost.

Second I don't like the development of Jason Bourne. In the old films he was hunting his lost past and the audience was thrilled with it. Now in this movie the motivation of Jason Bourne is very predictable.Third some scenes, especially at the end are a little bit to excessive and unrealistic in my opinion.To sum up, if you like the old Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon, you will like this movie.

" Review – Jason Bourne (2016) ..An unnecessary but entertaining sequel! [3/5]
",0.63,0.8154,2017-06-05 00:00:00,6,"By now, the audience that has watched 'Jason Bourne' would be wondering why a fourth sequel was even made when the storyline was never that strong enough to bring Jason back from exile. Yes, the big question on everyone's mind. When Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon were set to join hands for yet another Jason Bourne outing, who wouldn't have been excited in the first place?In many ways, films in the Bourne franchise (barring Legacy) were a marked improvement (with regard to overall quality and execution) in comparison with contemporary action flicks of their respective times. The CGI application was kept at a bare minimum, and the realistically choreographed action sequences were a definite strong- point. The franchise peaked at Ultimatum and like every other person who loved the series, I too believed that Jason better be kept under wraps unless something exceptionally brilliant came along maybe years down the line. And here we are!Unfortunately, this film cannot come close to topping Ultimatum or its prequels in terms of basic plot or thrills. But that doesn't mean 'Jason Bourne' is a bad flick. It holds firm ground as a decent standalone, with a couple of mind-blowing action set pieces. The Las Vegas car-chase scene at the end was pure eye-candy for action buffs. The cinematography is yet again as shaky as it gets (in typical Bourne style!). The drawback here arrives in the form of the storyline. We, the audience, are asked to empathize with Jason over the conspiratorial death of his dad many years ago. The scene involving Jason and his father (in a flashback) lasts about two minutes to be precise. Meh, not enough to extract enough interest from an average viewer. While the reason for his murder and the proceedings that follow (such as the social media-surveillance connection) aren't convincing by a long- shot, director Paul Greengrass tries to compensate with pulsating action played out by a cast that includes Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Vincent Cassell and Julia Stiles (returning as Nicky Parsons and seems to have aged gracefully).Vikander is the new-gen addition here but surprisingly her role is mostly restrained to giving instructions from a surveillance point, up until the climax. Still, she gels with the Bourne franchise vibe quite easily and could be an interesting character to look into, in case further sequels or spin-offs are made. Cassell's character remains that of a typical assassin for most part and he fits the bill. Damon looks old and tired, but still got the goods when it comes to doing action scenes. In fact, no serious issues at all with any of the casting choices. I also had major hopes with regards to the storyline (when Greengrass and editor Christopher Rouse were said to be penning the screenplay) but this is where I kind of felt letdown. The only scene that brought a smile to my face was at the very end, right before Moby's 'Extreme Ways' started playing and the end-credits rolled up.Nonetheless, 'Jason Bourne' is still several notches above your CGI filled nonsensical actioners that are churned out by Hollywood week after week. It never bores you, but it fails to top its predecessors."

There is no denying that it is great to see Matt Damon back as Jason Bourne after all these years, he is still in great form as ever, keeping that level of passion and dedication that is required for a part like this. Paul Greengrass also does a stellar job back at the directors chair, delivering some mind blowing sequences that fans of the franchise will be pleased with.I think the main reason it is a bit of a let down is because the title character has full realisation of who he is now, which takes away a lot of the excitement. The main fun of the films, such as Supremacy and Ultimatum, is that we only know as much as Bourne does, and feel a part of the mystery in trying to uncover secrets of his past. Now that he knows everything, we are left feeling a little underwhelmed. As well as that, it is a lot more typical and predictable than the previous movies. Every event that is going to occur can be seen from a mile away, every twist and turn throughout. It gets tedious, to a certain degree when you know everything that's coming. It's a visually pleasing film, albeit not very stimulating one. Action packed, and at times a bit tiresome, fans of the movies should check out Jason Bourne, or even if you are looking for an easy action, just do not go out of your way to see it. Bourne comes out of hiding to discover more truths about the organisation and his past. Best Performance: Matt Damon"
" Love it!
",0.6696,0.9945,2017-06-01 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie and would rate it 10 out of 10, but the only reason I don't is because I've gotta compare it to the original three Bourne movies and compared to the original three (Identity, Supremacy, and Ultimatum)...it's not as good. That being said, my true rating is technically 10 out of 10 while I rate the original three 1,000 out of 10 each. Since I can only give a max of 10 out of 10 here on IMDb, I've rated this a 9 out of 10 and the original 3 a 10 out of 10 to show that I love the original three more. I loved seeing Jason Bourne (the character) again after all these years after The Bourne Ultimatum. If you are a fan of the original 3 then I'd say you should definitely see this at least once. Whether or not you want to watch it again is your choice, I can only speak for myself when I say I've already seen this movie about 5 times at least after seeing it in the theaters. In conclusion, this movie is amazing but Identity, Supremacy, and Ultimatum are extremely extremely EXTREMELY EXTREMELY amazing."
" The least awesome Bourne movie
",-0.5096,0.9947,2017-06-01 00:00:00,5,"I'll start with a simple answer to what many people are wondering--this latest Bourne movie is the weakest in a famously strong series. It has a little of the fantastic espionage, chases, and fights that made the first three movies so great. There is not as much as fantastic stuff as the other movies, but there is a little bit. It also has many, many flaws. I will now go through a few of the flaws that I found most glaring.Why exactly was Jason fighting all those guys? If he is doing it to make money, that's a poor choice because he has an abundance of skills that he could easily use to make money in other, less punishing ways. Plus I never saw him collect any money after he finished winning his fights. The best I can figure is that he was fighting so he had a reason to take his shirt off.The movie had a lame premise. I imagine there's a good chance that literally the first idea pitched for the movie was the government surveillance angle. Then they just said, ""Cool. That's pretty good. We don't need to try to come up with something more creative. We'll just go with that."" - Some of the movie's framing appeared to intentionally make it difficult to see what was going on. That doesn't make the movie smarter. It's just kind of annoying.Why is the incredibly old CIA guy (shouts to Tommy Lee Jones) heading a project clearly better suited for a younger person, you know, someone who actually understands this new, potentially beneficial technology and isn't afraid of it? - A big part of the story was Bourne seeking relief from guilt for the people he had killed in the past. He also sought a renewed sense of purpose. At movie's end, he had found neither of those things. This supports my position that movie is a waste of time.To me personally, the ending of the movie didn't really feel like an ending. I'd love to explain this in more depth but I would have to give spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that.All that said, I still enjoyed a few of the classic moments featuring Jason Bourne evading death, rigging up cool stuff, and winning fights. So I wouldn't call the movie a total loss.I just care about these movies, so I want them to be great. It hurt me to see a movie Bourne movie that wasn't great, the way watching my favorite team lose in the playoffs hurts. I'm still a fan. I will still root for my team. All my criticism comes from a good place. I want the Bourne series to return to its former glory. If it does, I'll be the first one to sing its praises. Sadly, after watching this most recent Bourne movie, I didn't feel like singing."
" Don't listen to the whining children
",-0.2263,0.8591,2017-05-20 00:00:00,8,"There are plenty reviewers here that complain about the quality of this movie. I don't know what they're talking about. They're spoiled brats, way too much pampered with high quality products and demanding ever more. What have they themselves to give, except for unsaturated desire? I tell you people, this is top notch movie making. Bourne has matured, and comes to a conclusion point. There's something to think about, and you can feel the tragic of the life he has to live. Nonetheless, there's still enough point of your seat action, and intrigue, and the astonishing depth of digital world control. So the plot is intelligent and exciting. A worthy continuation of the Bourne cycle, and with high class acting. I enjoyed it very much - as much as its predecessors."
" Bourne looking back
",0.0,-0.0745,2017-05-20 00:00:00,5,"Bourne is back after almost a decade but this is a tired retread, almost a greatest hits package.We have a Wikileaks type opening as Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) in Reykjavik has discovered some hacked black ops relating to Bourne and how he got on to the Treadstone program and goes off to Greece to find him, but the CIA led by director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) are not far behind.Bourne is off grid making money by street fighting but haunted by memories of his childhood and the death of his father. However once Parsons contacts him and they are under attack, Bourne is back to get more answers and is on a collision course to meet that man who killed his father and who is now looking to do the same thing to Bourne.Alicia Vikander plays Heather Lee, head of the CIA cyber ops division and ambitious enough to figure out that Bourne could be useful in exposing Dewey's role who she believes is a dinosaur. Vincent Cassel plays the super bad guy assassin who can seemingly walk into anywhere and find the most convenient vantage point.Since the Bourne Ultimatum in 2007, the spy genre has had Mission Impossible films reactivated by Tom Cruise doing ever more elaborate set pieces and the granddaddy of them all, James Bond finding his mojo in Skyfall, winning Oscars and joining the billion dollar box office club.Now it is Bourne left behind, competently entertaining but giving the impression everyone just turned up to the party for the money. Just look at the car chase sequence at Las Vegas Boulevard, we see them heading towards the Paris and it takes them ages to reach the casinos in the vicinity even though it is a high speed car chase. I could had reached there faster on foot."
" too many chases and...
",0.0,-0.6547,2017-05-19 00:00:00,4,"the plot was too convoluted. Simply put, this was a film that did not need to be made. First Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne after another actor took over the role. That right there should indicate this movie should not have been made. And there are just too many chases, running or motor bikes. And I couldn't stand the voice of Alicia Vikander, it was too monotone, and I just didn't like her character because of it. And this movie expects us to believe everyone in the CIA is corrupt. I don't believe that.FINAL VERDICT: There didn't need to be another chapter to Jason Bourne, just too much of the same and the ""action"" just not that interesting with all the running. Skip it."
" Only one flaw but I can live with it.
",0.0,-0.4767,2017-05-14 00:00:00,10,"Paul Greengrass returns to guide Matt Damon in this 5th installment of the Jason Bourne series and the sequel to The Bourne Ultimatum. Damon plays the main character, ex CIA assassin and psychogenic amnesiac quite well. My only problem was at the end Heather Lee convinces Intelligence Director Edwin Russell that Tommy Lee Jones methods are outdated and offers herself as his replacement as CIA Director and Russell's eyes and ears within the Agency. She outlines her plan to use Bourne's trust to bring him back in, then tells Russell she's even prepared to kill Bourne if he refuses. Then she meets with Bourne, promising him that the CIA will become what he thought it was when he joined. Bourne asks for time to consider the offer and walks away. She returns to her car and finds a recording of the conversation she had with Russell about what she'd do to Bourne. For 30+ years stuck in Federal Government work at the cabinet level I continuously warned my staff about NEVER boasting or speaking out-of-school because what is said or texted WILL come back to hurt you - as Malcolm X said ""The chickens do come home to roost"". So, when Heather Lee allows herself to tell Director Russell what she'll do to Bourne I was deeply troubled that someone of her status would actually say such a thing since she of all people should know about surveillance."
" What was Damon thinking??
",0.0,-0.3787,2017-05-14 00:00:00,3,"I just saw this on HBO last night (05-13) . I was embarrassed for Matt Damon just 10 minutes in. What a disgrace to the franchise this garbage is. It is a two hour chase scene, with no story, a cute girl, a CIA where everyone is a criminal, computer errors and baloney technology that couldn't work even if wiki leaks tried to use them, almost no dialog, more mistakes than a day in the Trump White House, and nothing original to offer.Then, three hours later, I tried to watch it again to make sure I wasn't unfairly rating it poorly because of the three incredible franchise films it followed, and I couldn't sit through it a second time. It was THAT BAD. If you hadn't seen any of the prior Bourne movies, you would rate this at 1.5 stars out of 4.If you watch it as a sequel to the other three, it gets 1 star for the cute girl. It has so many goofs in it, I found myself laughing out loud at the screen as if I were watching a comedy.To Matt: Matt, I love most of your prior work, so I'm going to give you a pass on this poor excuse for a paycheck endeavor of yours here, but please don't disappoint like this again, or I will start having real concerns about your judgment."
" Stop moving the camera!
",-0.3595,-0.9644,2017-05-13 00:00:00,4,"Trying to watch ""Jason Bourne"" on HBO, but I'm getting motion sickness! Every shot is a moving camera...EVERY STINKING SHOT! Back in the day, crap like this would have gotten an ""F"" in film school! It sucks the enjoyment right out of the movie! It is bad enough these days when they do it in action scenes, but this flick does it in dialogue scenes and throughout the whole damned movie. Add the current editing style of weasel on speed butcher cutting and you have one dizzying experience. Greengrass is a horrible visual director and all of his films are shot and edited in the same crummy way! he needs to be tied to a chair, like Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange"" and forced to watch classic, well made movies. Enough of this filmmaking style already. Stick a fork in me, I'm done!"
" A Classic Bourne Film Filled with Flaws
",0.0,-0.9595,2017-05-09 00:00:00,5,"Jason Bourne follows the character of Jason Bourne as he is brought back into his old life to discover who he was before he became an assassin, meanwhile being hunted by the CIA (I think). I actually don't know who was hunting him. All these undercover law enforcing agencies have such fancy- shmancy names, it's hard to remember them all. Similar to the last three movies, Jason Bourne is very much a Bourne movie. It's shot largely the same way and it uses the same music at the same times, and all around it is pretty reminiscent. In addition, the action is, while done almost completely with shaky cam, still kind of exciting. Sure shaky cam is the easy way out, but there's a reason why people still use it. It's kind of exciting if done right. However, I had two major problems with this movie. One of them was the directing. Sure, it is largely shot like the other Bourne movies, but that doesn't mean that it always was, nor does it mean that other Bourne movies were, shot well. There were a few scenes where I actually laughed out loud at how dumb it was. On occasion the camera would zoom in on Matt Damon suddenly, as if it were some kind of kung fu ninja-type movie panning on a character's eyes to show intensity. The only problem is is that here it was completely out of place and just plain goofy. My second problem with the movie was the acting. In particular, the handful of scenes in which Julia Stiles appears alongside Matt Damon. Damon is already not that great in this movie or any of the ones before, but with her he just sucks. Oh yeah, and she's also terrible. She's absolutely awful in this movie, I'm happy she didn't stick around.Overall Jason Bourne kind of sucks. Sure, it's consistent with the other Bourne films technically speaking, but with the performances of both Matt Damon and Julia Stiles weighing it down, the occasionally goofy directing and bad directing as a whole, this is one worth skipping. In the end I wouldn't recommend it."
" Sadly a disappointing sequel of the Bourne series
",-0.7184,0.9477,2017-05-07 00:00:00,6,"I was a big fan of the Bourne series since watching the first movie. Matt Damon did an excellent job in playing the role as Jason. However, after the first three, exceptional titles, this last one was nothing more than a good action thriller. However, I was quite disappointed after watching Jason Bourne. It just don't felt that dense and enthralling like the first two movies with Damon. Yes, it was thrilling to some point but it seems the director wanted way more action than other elements in his movie. There was something missing. The point of the i, the little drop that makes the barrel slop over, that feeling that the other two movies had. Even If I'm a huge fan of the series I would recommend the producers to just stop here and let the series become history instead of wasting it for another action movie that maybe ruins the whole series. Also, Damon is becoming older and even if he seems quite fit in Jason Bourne, I could bet he won't cut out a fine figure in a possible sequel. If they really decide to work on another title, I really hope they take their time and push out a masterpiece of a thriller, not a James Bond-like action flick."
" Very favorite movie
",0.5095,0.9309,2017-05-02 00:00:00,9,"One of our best favorite movies, hoping a lot for another sequel.We love you a lot Jason Bourne a lot and a lot.Live forever and God bless you forever and ever along with all your team...!!! At first we don't like Matt Damon but after watching The Bourne Identity,he became one of our favorite actors of the world."
" Just Watch The Original Bourne Movies
",0.3182,0.8992,2017-04-27 00:00:00,2,I do not have a single positive thing to say about this piece of crap. Matt Damon must have needed a paycheck in a bad way to be involved in this mess. The producers are also the writers and just made this to tag on to the Jason Bourne franchise that was done so well before. But they do not write well and this should not have been made. In fact the director is heavy-handed and I do not like his direction either. I understand an action picture takes many liberties to move the story along and expects the audience to accept that fact and let it go. I can't do that with this picture as the liberties they took made me lose the story line as they were far from believable. Case in point: satellite and CCTV images that were able to follow characters anywhere they went in or outside of buildings in a city half way around the world. Come on guys...just write a better story. And I am amazed that Paul Greengrass did such a poor job directing this one as he seemed much better at it before as he directed the second picture. The scene where Bourne enters a theater and knows right away where to shoot to hit the hidden gunman behind a second story grill was so incredibly unbelievable it was almost laughable. Do yourself a favor the give this a miss. Watch the Bourne Identity or the next two films and forget this obvious crap that is only taking your money.

" The super spy Bourne has never looked so amateurish.
",0.5994,0.9963,2017-04-13 00:00:00,5,"The perplexingly titled Jason Bourne arrives nine years after the last entry of the series, and honestly, doesn't deliver anything new.When Nicki, an ex-Treadstone operative, uncovers new secrets about the closed operation and the existence of a new one, she calls on Jason Bourne to look into it. The super agent has all but vanished into obscurity, but Nicki has him at a disadvantage the secrets pertain to Jason's father's involvement in Treadstone.I am a huge fan of the original Bourne trilogy (2002 – 2007) and I consider it one of the most well defined and consistently excellent trilogies ever made. So when The Bourne Legacy was made and turned out to be a cash-grab by Universal Studios, I had reservations about a return for director Paul Greengrass and actor Matt Damon this yearBut I had hoped my intuition was wrong.This film has a fair bit going for it too. Tommy Lee Jones (another favourite of mine) joins the cast, as well as rising starlet Alicia Vikander and familiar French face Vincent Cassel. Yet one quickly realises while watching, this film has very little fresh about it. It feels like Bourne has less at stake here than in the previous films, and even the CIA's interest in him seems less convincing than before. Bourne's past, before training at Treadstone, is a legitimate question; even Ultimatum didn't cover the why behind Bourne's initiation, it only answered the main overbearing questions: what and how and even who. But even the why isn't explained in any great detail here, the film feels compressed and muddled, almost refusing to focus on Bourne's new question and preferring to follow a young tech mogul revealing a new app that the CIA want to use to monitor the public. I honestly don't know; there are two stories at play and neither gel together. One is Tommy Lee Jones' Director of the CIA and his attempts at corrupting this new app into a tool for use of spying on the nation, the other is Bourne looking for answers about his father and the history of Treadstone.It all feels tangled when the two meet.Personally, the one thing Jason Bourne lacks is an especially skilled Jason Bourne. Supremacy and especially Ultimatum championed Bourne's increasing skillset and understanding to thwart capture. Here it is a steady action movie / revenge plot. Vincent Cassel's hit-man wants revenge on Bourne, but that story gets lost in the screenplay squeeze.It is sad to say, but nothing stood out for me. There was no definitive moment of ""wow"", like Bourne's skills of espionage, or a colossal chase. There are two, but they just don't feel particularly original. I can safely say that the consistency with the trilogy exists otherwise; it is Paul Greengrass doing his thing, John Powell was still involved with the score. So it isn't a terrible film; it does entertain for two hours!In light of being a fourth part from an excellent, well rounded trilogy, this entry simply wasn't unique enough to stand with the others. It ultimately feels unnecessary. Not quite the cash-grab Legacy was, but certainly lacking."
" Bang, crash, wallop
",-0.4019,-0.9548,2017-04-09 00:00:00,3,"More action than ever this time in the Bourne franchise, and this time the lead Producer credit is given to star Matt Damon. He has a lot going for him, not least the fact that without him there can be no more Bourne films. And so we have non-stop action with barely a heartbeat between drastic events. The film contains possibly the most elaborate and fantastic car chase sequence in cinema history. I hate to see all those things smashed up, at enormous cost. Couldn't they have saved a few tens of millions of dollars by just smashing up half as much? Is it really necessary to try to get into the Guinness Book of Records for smashing up the most cars in a film sequence? And what happened to the story? There is barely time to sketch a story line, squeezing in a few expository bits of hastened or gasped dialogue here and there between the cracks of all the action, action, action. The film is like a kind of violent computer game made by people high on cocaine. Surely this is an expensive religious offering laid upon the altar of testosterone, mindless violence having become the new god of Hollywood. We have occasional anguished moments when with fuzzy images seen in montage, repeated several times, Matt Damon as Jason Bourne remembers that he was once really David Webb. He holds his dying father Richard Webb in his arms but cannot remember that it was really Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassell who had him assassinated. So they are the bad guys, closely modelled after their real life counterparts in the psychotic world of black ops and of rogue security agencies run amok. Vincent Cassell as 'the Asset', namely the most ruthless assassin for the CIA imaginable, shoots so many people casually as he rushes about that we really do wonder, in those split seconds when we are permitted the slightest degree of thought: what about all those bodies lying around? Are we to assume that they have all gone unnoticed? Everywhere he goes, bang bang bang with his silencer, and bodies drop like that white stuff that comes out of pigeons. No one cleans up. Why should they? This is a computer game where bodies disappear automatically. The excitement intended to be generated by all this non-stop violence and murder reminds me of that generated at raves, where everybody just goes wild and thrashes around. Yes, this film thrashes around like a basket of snakes. And if more than five minutes passes without somebody getting shot, well then the producers seem to think they have failed. The motto seems to have been: 'Give 'em no time to think, just keep the hearts pounding and the bloodlust up.' Is this the kind of thing we should all be watching? Is this good for society? Is this what you should be letting your kids see?"

",0.0,-0.7248,2017-04-08 00:00:00,3,"I loved the Bourne trilogy and thought the final installment, Bourne Ultimatum, concluded Jason's story very succinctly and well. This movie did not need to be made and the entire film felt like a cash grab to a very big fan. I call the Bourne movies my favorite movie series just abouts, so watching this film hurt more than a lot :\ I even didn't watch this on purpose for years, knowing I would dislike it. I only watched it with my Dad because he wanted to bond, and ooooooh did we bond making fun of this terrible movie. Cliché at this point car chases for no reason at all, people dying left and right that you couldn't care less about, and a cyclical plot surrounding Jason Bourne where the writers torture his story to death then revive it then torture it again....just let him have some semblance of happiness, geez. Don't see this movie and tell your Dad we'll watch Avengers or something. Time to forget I ever saw this excuse for a Bourne storyline."
" Terrible
",-0.4767,0.8116,2017-03-30 00:00:00,1,"Spoilers....What a complete piece of crap. The most cliché Bourne movie to date. What is with these movies with the shaky camera. Do they really think that bouncing a camera around makes for good cinematography? As for the story, you have the same old unimaginative plot. First you have the CIA cyber woman who suddenly becomes an expert on operations, oh, and also seems to be a forensic psychologist as she predicts Bournes moves. Then these CIA agents act with complete loyalty, never questioning their orders...except when this woman just changes her mind for no apparent reason and warns Bourne. Next, You have the completely telegraphed murder of Nicky Parsons. The incredible ways they acquire a target isn't even believable. I get it, it's a movie. I can watch the original ""The Bourne Identity"" (1988) with Richard Chamberlain and still be on the edge of my seat with a fraction of the action of a newer movie. I can't help but think that people in the real intelligence community watch these movies and laugh their asses off."

""Hey, we need to show our hero early on has fallen on hard times. What can we do?"" Then we get the standard spy-movie scene where the hero has a big handful of passports. How about when there were about 10,000 angry protesters in a massive riot, but Matt Damon and Julia Stiles were still able to find each other, no problem. And then they were able to talk to each other with their normal voices, and still hear each other perfectly among the chaos. Then of course, we continue the clichés when we find out one of the ""good guys"" was bad. Seriously, was it any surprise to anyone on earth that Tommy Lee Jones wasn't legit?

People see Matt Damon as something less than what he portrays in these movies and he is so much more. I know of no other Actor that I admire, remember and find pure, honest, ability, not the jacked up hype of a long time loser like Tom Cruise. Matt doesn't try to be younger and more handsome, he is just playing the character and you get lost in the story, that's the whole point. So, for those ""nay Sayers"", open your eyes to true acting and stop with the personal attacks. I don't want the unbelievable, because it is unattainable, I want the attainable because it is believable. Thanks Matt."

I liked the effort to tie together the other movies and the slight twist of the father being involved.But the camera work killed it for my wife and I. She got dizzy and I got an upset stomach. Tommy Lee Jones said it all in the interview. ""The camera never stops moving"". While this is the latest trend in film making, we hate it. I think this is cheap ""in the face"" action as you can not see anything clearly. I have to say it is clearly geared for the younger generation, which grew up on video games with the very fast scene switching constantly. I gave up games years ago because of the seasickness. Yes, I am a baby boomer. So since I am on the way out, I have to suffer the new trends as best I can.The movie is rated 6.7 at time of my review which is way below the 10/10/10 of the trilogy and even the 8 of the Legacy. It falls down in not being quite true to the spirit of the originals with very tight clear cut action. Giggling cameras and tight shots may be easier to make a good take, cheaply, but make for very poor action. Back up and hold the camera still and show us how skillful the scene unfolds. Watch Jackie Chan. I actually thought they got a different director and camera operator to make the movie, it was so different.The required car chase and multiple destruction is getting old but I guess it fits a little. One thing I could never understand in the trilogy is why Bourne never does much in the way of disguise. A baseball cap is the best we get. Simple paper wads in the mouth make the computer face recognition fail, as do glasses, lipstick, eyebrow pencil,etc. Very easy to acquire and apply and shows sophistication worthy of JB. It would have helped the movie at little cost.The updating to more modern computer era was good but not too well done in my book. My suspension of belief was nearly lost on the ""prediction of escape route"" scene. I could have lived with it if the rest of the movie was better. And too bad Nicky is dead.I gave the movie 6 out of 10, just barley above average, and I was very disappointed. I would have given it less but I like the trilogy+1, the cast, the relatively decent story and usually the director. The obvious last scene setting up for a new movie looked like a cheap ad. If they make it, I hope they go back to the old style. Lock down that stupid camera."

Unnecessary and definitely a wrong move for the franchise. 2. All the shaky and close up camera shots were very annoying, and did not do justice to the choreography of the fight sequences and stunts (better see the making of the scenes in the bonus materials section). Very bad direction and editing there. 3. The story is weak, cliché, trite and banal. (The father was the inventor of these black ops?... Please! For $120 million dollars and they come up with that (seems very desperate) reason for Jason Bourne to resurface?) 4. Tommy Lee Jones (a very old, haggard, alcoholic looking - he isn't ageing well.) is definitely not as good or memorable as Noah Vosen by David Strathairn ; just like Alicia Vikander is definitely unconvincing in her role as a replacement of Pam Landy by Joan Allen. 5.

",0.5255,0.9924,2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,"I went to see Jason Bourne in the theater on its opening night. Like many other fans of the Bourne trilogy (Identity, Supremacy & Ultimatum), I came away unimpressed. I left the theater that night feeling disappointed as I thought the film was redundant and uninspired. That night I logged into IMDb and gave the movie a ""6"" rating.Over the past few months I've had numerous conversations with friends about this movie and they were surprised I didn't like the film...especially knowing that I'm such a huge fan of the original trilogy. At their prodding I decided tonight to give the film a second viewing.8 months later and after watching the film for a second time my opinion of the film has improved quite a bit. I increased my rating from a ""6"" to an ""8"".This time around I appreciated the complexity of Heather Lee character. First time around I thought her character to be too young for her responsibility. Now I realize her character represents a counter to the Tommy Lee Jones characters's ""old thinking"" as well as a philosophic counterpoint to the Aaron Kalloor character.I also found myself sucked into the action much more this time around. The Athens riot scene in particular is amazing and ranks right up there with the best action scenes from the original trilogy. The Las Vegas convention scene is also very effective as is the final battle against the asset. The pacing of the whole film seems to be better upon a 2nd viewing. The only negative I can report after the second viewing is the Las Vegas car chase borders on being too over the top...especially when the SWAT vehicle plows thru all those cars...Seriously?All in all I am so glad my friends convinced me to give ""Jason Bourne"" a second chance. Did I enjoy ""Jason Bourne"" more because I watched it in my Home Theater without distraction? Or is it because I had lower expectations? Whatever the reason, I found ""Jason Bourne"" to be much better after a second viewing.I recommend a second viewing if you were disappointed with the film when it premiered last year. Hopefully your opinion of ""Jason Bourne"" will improve just as mine did!"
" Action-movie Bourne - not really a Bourne movie
",0.0,0.6575,2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"This is, most certainly, one of the more controversial Bourne films. The question is, whether it is a Bourne film. Lacking the usual thriller, plot development and coherence, it explores things past, but possibly looking to a different future. Unfortunately, the technical side of the film is lacking, with occasional mumbo-jumbo and the infamous ""enhance!"" tricks. Still, the themes used a fairly contemporary, if only they were presented better. If I were to rate it purely as a Bourne movie, it would score lower. However, scoring it as another installment of an action franchise, which is what it is, brings it to 7. The ending was certainly the better part of the whole film, and Alicia Vikander, while not her best performance, was a fairly interesting character to watch."

The story is very weak and I don't get why it has still such a high rating. It's nothing compared to the first ones. Even though we all know Big Brother is already always watching us, in Jason Bourne there are plenty of ridiculous scenes that are absolutely impossible. Just as an example when the CIA searches for Bourne in the middle of a big riot in Athens and manage to find him and follow him between the smoke bombs, Molotov cocktails, thousands of rioting Greeks, it's too ridiculous for words. And to know exactly when he's going to pass at one point it's just too laughable to watch. I get that it can be entertaining for people that don't care about details like that but to me it's just not enjoyable to watch. I almost fell asleep a couple of times and the end could not come soon enough. Despite good actors like Matt Damon and Vincent Cassel the movie is just not good enough. You can have the best actors in the world but for a good movie you have to have a good story-line what clearly is not the case here. Tommy Lee Jones is also not good at all in this movie. Just don't bother watching it."

It's used so many times it loses meaning.Clay Face, the blonde killed in the beginning, is awful.Swede Girl, playing Tommy Lee Jones' protégé, tries to hide her accent, but she frequently fails.The movie is confused. It's shot with a fast cut style that makes you scream ""hold the camera still, I want to see what's happening!"" The plot is so convoluted that at one point Tommy Lee Jones, bereft of his usual swagger, has his ""asset"" kill Jones' own men. He had to stop them from doing what he didn't want them to do. So, instead of ordering them to do what he wants, he kills them. It makes sense.The characters speak in misplaced jargon so often that it sounds like a bad fan film. They refer to their counter Bourne killer as ""the asset"" so often, it seems they call him that at dinner. ""Hey, Asset, can you pass the peas."" Agents have eyes on people, keep asking for the sit rep, answer the phone with ""go"" or ""yeah"" - it's like watching people at a convention cosplay re-enact their favorite TV show.Go away Bourne."

You wouldn't see most of the elements portrayed in a cartoon. There are some fight scenes where it is legitimately difficult to discern what is even happening due to the rapid editing.

Even without a story, I would have given it another star if there were, say, a real cool skateboard chase, maybe with some leaping over cars, twisting 180 degrees mid-air to fire a few rounds, etc. There were plenty of bullets but, alas, not enough to qualify it as a proper art movie..."
" Not even for the fans of the franchise - uninspired, lacks intelligence and poorly acted.
",0.4767,0.9943,2017-02-04 00:00:00,4,"Jason Bourne became a household name when Matt Damon stormed into the big screen as a man with many capabilities who has forgotten his past. The world has since got hooked into this new age action full of high octane chases, intense hand-to-hand combat sequences and a human element brought in by Matt Damon. There may have been moments in the trilogy where the script might have faltered a bit and immediately comes the next action set piece to completely distract and make you lose your train of thought. While this isn't in the same league, I might go as far as calling it a pale imitation of the Bourne movie imitators.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has secluded himself to a life of torture punishing himself for his past. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) hacks into the CIA network and steals the details about all the black ops files including the latest one - 'Iron Hand'. When she contacts Jason Bourne to help her get this content public, CIA director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones), Cyber Head Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) along with an Asset (Vincent Cassel) unleash the full wrath of the agency into finding them to put an end to their nemesis.Matt Damon is a very unorthodox actor and I never saw him play a role very convincingly. Good Will Hunting was an exceptional movie, but I never felt that he was the best person to play the title character. In fact I feel the same for most of his movies. But not while he is playing Jason Bourne. For me, he is Jason Bourne. However this movie shows that he is clearly past his prime to play that character and just comes off as a brooding sociopath who just likes to play cat and mouse with the Agency.Alicia Vikander seems to have extended her role Ava from Ex Machina, in fact she shows much more emotions there. Tommy Lee Jones character is one of the most clichéd characters played over and over in Hollywood where his persona and skill makes it watchable, rather bearable. Riz Ahmed is going from strength to strength and is building up an impressive filmography, he suits the role of a young tech billionaire. Vincent Cassel just joined in for the brooding contest and his role is uncooked and inconsistent. So far from the review, I have definitely made the point that it is a partially boring, heavily predictable and poorly acted Bourne movie, it is also the most logically unsatisfying, contemporarily lost one. To describe a few instances - the analytics and customer personalization abilities speech by Aaron Kalloor is at least 15 years too old, why does a Cyber head run field ops, the final chase has the Bourne's Dodge getting knocked around by so many vehicles and the air bags doesn't pop out, all the top secret black ops files are present sequentially in the file system of CIA servers, in fact anything to do with technology seems to be done by someone who doesn't understand it or not updated with the current ways, the manner in which the previous agents cause mayhem when they run amok in the traffic chasing each other in the name of collateral damage (reminded me of Transformers). These are just a few that I could recall when writing this review and I am sure there were a lot more. The chases, hand to hand combats, especially dialogues are uninspired. The editing department should have chopped at least 30 mins runtime off the movie that could have made it at least a little more bearable. Paul Greengrass is not someone who just made the shaky camera cinematography famous but has made some excellent movies too. Greengrass, Matt Damon and the rest of the crew should have stayed off this project. My next dream Jason Bourne movie would be to have him placed living a peaceful life in a suburb and he needs to use his skills to save the day in a small domestic environment as an action comedy.Not even for the fans of the franchise - uninspired, lacks intelligence and poorly acted."
" A steady decline in Bourne campaigns
",0.0,0.9685,2017-01-28 00:00:00,4,"Jason Bourne starts off with a bang. The initial 20 minutes or so are simply superb. There is a fantastic chase sequence in the background of public unrest in Athens, Greece. The chase itself ends with a powerful scene. At this point, expectations run high, I mean, really high.And then it fell apart. The movie spirals down into set of sequences that are both naive and silly. CIA Director is giving orders to assassins directly, people are getting shot in live TV, etc.Honestly, the Bourne movies had their best ones till 2007 Bourne Ultimatum. 2012 Bourne Legacy and now, 2016 Jason Bourne are testimony of what happens when the freshness in execution and intrigue in the story disappears. Jason Bourne could have been lot better. This is one more Bourne movie we will all love to believe never existed."

Unfortunately, this franchise now seems very tired. Jason Bourne searching for answers about his past, assassins trying to kill him and the obligatory city car chase. Matt Damon is fine as Bourne and Tommy Lee Jones re-enacts his role from 'The Fugitive'. Alicia Vikander, as a CIA operative was the most memorable thing in the movie. There is nothing wrong with the movie, but there is nothing that good either. When Bourne first came out it was a wake-up call to the Bond franchise, and they answered with a new type of Bond in Daniel Craig. For Bourne to continue they need to do something different, because this was stale."
" This is not the Jason Bourne you're looking for.
",0.0,0.9931,2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"Hey now. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne in the new film that is simply titled, 'Jason Bourne', which teams up Damon and director Paul Greengrass once again for the spy thriller who seems to never remember who he is or where he came from. In addition to the usual losing sight of Jason Bourne, then spotting him in a big crowd, to losing him once again, the writers added HBO's 'Silicon Valley' show to the element without all of the fun or comedy. I'll get to that in a minute though.If I remember correctly, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' solved Jason Bourne's memory loss and got to the bottom of his backstory, but here, the writers cleverly added a little more information that has been missing from his mind in how he was recruited and what just happened to his father. This time, Bourne is a little older, sporting a few gray hairs in his beard and is easily winning bare-knuckle fights overseas to make money to survive, while still having Vietnam inspired flashbacks to his earlier days with his father. New CIA director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) and his protégé Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) come across Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), who hacks the CIA to retrieve a ton of sensitive information about 'Treadstone', their underhand dealings and practices, and Bourne himself, which plays out like a form of Wikileaks in reality.Parsons and Bourne meet up to expose the secret information with the CIA on their tale as well as Dewey's right hand assassin called 'The Asset' (Vincent Cassel) to take out Bourne and then again everyone else in his way. Going back to the 'Silicon Valley' aspect, the writers have added a character named Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed from the recent HBO show 'The Night Of'), who is the CEO of a social media platform called Deep Dream that has almost two billion users. Kalloor wants to keep the privacy of his users private, where Dewey wants a back door to the platform to spy on everyone using it, which all culminates on Las Vegas, where all the main players end up at a tach convention that plays out similarly to 'The Manchurian Candidate'.The story has a ton of plot holes and doesn't really all add up even though the premise and set up could have been amazing. If you know Paul Greengrass's work, you would know that he loves to film his action scenes and fight choreography with a ton of shaky cuts every couple of seconds, giving a chaotic feeling to the intense fights and setting. Rarely it works and with 'Jason Bourne', it only works in one excellent scene. Perhaps, it's the best scene in the movie where Greengrass has perfectly staged a huge violent protest in Athens against the police with fire bombs and chaos on every street. He films Parsons and Bourne weaving in and out of all the violence, bullets, and fire bombs on foot and on motorcycle with high intensity, while also capturing everything going on in the surrounding streets and extras. It's top notch filmmaking in this action area and what Greengrass does best.Unfortunately, the big climactic scene in Las Vegas is sub-par, as well as the rest of the big action chase scenes, which just seem redundant and less than thrilling between Bourne and The Asset. With too many shaky cam cuts every few seconds, you never get fully immersed in the action or situation. If Greengrass could film a chase scene or fight scene between two people and leave the camera rolling for more than ten seconds without cutting, it would go a long way as to truly show the talent and story to these action scenes. Instead, it's just a jumbled kind of mess. Bourne himself seems cut off this time from the whole world and lacks really any personal interactions or humanity, which was what made him so likable and relatable in the previous films.Here, he literally only has a few lines of dialogue in the movie, where the rest of his time is trying to escape the hands of The Asset or the CIA. There really is no emotion here whatsoever as he has evolved into some form of the Terminator, but hey, even the Terminator smiled once in a while. Tommy Lee Jones does an excellent job as the villain here as he always does, where Alicia Vikander turns in a solid performance, but the script hinders her from showing a real side of humanity, but rather just a stereotypical cold and lifeless government agent.Vincent Cassel is excellent in everything he does and has himself and Damon returning to Las Vegas again. Cassel's character is violent and brutal throughout the film and delivers a hearty villain dose to the story, but his last minutes of the film seem out of place, as he goes from calculated and intelligent to chaotic and unpredictable. It just didn't translate well, which is not his fault of course, but the scripts. 'Jason Bourne' is very underwhelming and isn't necessarily the high octane action picture you would expect. That being said, if you love Paul Greengrass's choppy style, I'm sure you'll enjoy this addition into the 'Bourne' universe.WORTH A LOOK!"

While I enjoyed the first film, the character Jason Bourne is just not particularly interesting enough to carry an ongoing film series. He learns little about himself and his identity as the films progress, most of the time he is just *there*, standing quietly, stone faced most scenes. He walks, punches, or crashes cars through the film, and by the time it's over with, I don't even care how or why it ends, I can't wait to leave, so I can get on with my evening, and so I can maybe take some aspirin, as I now have a headache from the close-up shaky cam. Many scenes are shot as close-up, with the camera violently shaking frantically. The third act car chase seemed like there might have been some good stunt work, but it is largely incomprehensible, not only due to the shaky cam, by also the close crop framing or every shot.At the end, there is not much closure or resolution to the plot, just the seemingly contractually obligated sequel bait ending."

",-0.5106,0.9978,2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"I adore the Bourne franchise it's one of my favourite action trilogies and I was extremely excited for Jason Bourne. If I'm completely honest I knew this film wasn't really that necessary but honestly as long as it continued the franchise in a respectable way I didn't mind unfortunately this film doesn't do that I found this to be an extremely disappointing film and unworthy addition to this series but at least it was miles ahead of Legacy which pretty much failed on every level. There are plenty of positives with this film that carry over from the previous films like Matt Damon, he's perfect as Jason Bourne and clearly hasn't forgotten how to play this character, he was fantastic in this film and proves to continue on as his most iconic role. Alicia Vikander was also really good in this film, I liked the unpredictability of her character and she pulled it of perfectly. One of my only complaints with the original trilogy was Nickys role, her character had been used to much at this point so I was glad that they decided to reduce her role in this movie. The massive action set piece in Athens was fantastic, intense and was a great re introduction into Bourne as a physical presence. Vincent Cassels character was very well done he had excellent and very clear motivations that made him a more satisfying antagonist. However there are far to many flaws in this film that stop it from being great. For one the whole CIA sub plot that worked well in the original trilogy did not here, it was dull, it subtracted from the main story and ultimately just wasn't interesting to me. Tommy Lee Jones seemed like he'd be an excellent fit for this role but he comes of as a cliché bad guy with Jones not really giving much to his performance. This film also relys heavily on exposition through reading, this happens constantly and was a bit lazy. While most of the action sequences are very good the final car chase in Las Vegas was just stupid, it was unrealistic and did not fit into the realistic grittiness of this franchise. As much as I hate to admit it this was the film where Paul Greengrass' shakiness got to me, it didn't always fit and made some scenes inconceivable. This was one of the most disappointing movies of 2016, Damon and Vikander were both fantastic in this film, some of the action sequences are good but the pacing is terrible, other than Cassel most of the villains are cliché characters, its subplots just don't work. I would like to see a sequel to this film that learns from the flaws of this film and makes for a better new trilogy. 5.6/10: C (Mediocre)"

I think it'll depend on the viewer whether this is a return to form or a backslide (I tend toward the latter) since it's entirely conventional. Bourne's pressed back into the open, the CIA's omnipresent, and a misunderstood secret is at the heart of all of this. And then there are the chases, one after another. What made the shaky cam work in the prior sequels was the extra shot of adrenaline they added to the escape. But those movies also had good stories. Here, every character's a new version of one we've seen before. Seriously, you can swap 'em right out.This could've been great, but it also could've been awful, I guess. But with ""Ultimatum"" having so nicely wrapped things up, this story wasn't necessary. If your idea of a 2016 Bourne movie is finding the man all beefed up on the underground brawling circuit (flagrantly taking a page from ""Rambo III"") then repeating past plots . . . well, then this should fill the void nicely.6/10"

In that case, he had had enough pounding and just quit. In this case, viewers of the Jason Bourne series have reached post-saturation on the same endless, pointless chases. (Would someone kill this guy already? Please?)At this point, Bourne's endless genesis revenge against the CIA is really starting to seem like whining. Yes, he was brainwashed and driven to the point of a psychotic break. But on the other hand, he volunteered; plus, he was trained to be very handy. If he doesn't want to kill, he'll make a kick butt electrician because he's always popping open a circuit board and in seconds working wonders. Just imagine: the next time the fuses blow at your house, you call ACME Electric and Jason Bourne shows up. And that's the only time I want to see him ever again."

The story-line and plot was good but I think this film should have had more action scenes and more intense chase scenes to compliment the story-line and plot. There was a little too much camera shaking and zooming in and out in the few action scenes this film had to make the action look more intense than what it really was. What really kept this film afloat was the character of Jason Bourne. As usual he could not be contained and he out smarted anyone who tried to take him in, rather they looked like a friend or not."

Jason became a superspy after the death of his father but it turns out his father wasn't killed by a runaway sled named Rosebud but by his Uncle played by Tommy Lee Jones. Who then marries his mother played by Julia Stiles which means that his mother is now both his sister and his aunt. So Jason starts therapy but it goes sideways when it turns out that the therapist is a double agent and a ghost. I am pretty sure that synopsis is fairly accurate. The movie starts with a decent action scene in what is both supposed to be and clearly is not Athens and ends with a great action scene in what is supposed to be and clearly is Las Vegas. In between these two tentpoles I have a couple of issues besides the incomprehensible plot (see above). First of all, if you are going to put up a title card for Berlin, London, Athens or Las Vegas you really don't need to give us the country. Second, while the dynamic shaky cam is useful during dynamic chase scenes, though honestly I am not a fan, it needs to be turned off when characters are looking at their phone or just having coffee. Third yelling enhances computer monitor will not turn a dozen blurry pixels into Julia Stiles. And last what is it with modern movies showing our intelligence agencies murdering all their henchmen like some particularly demented James Bond villain. I noticed this silliness in Suicide Squad of all things but it is even sillier here. You just can't go killing your own agent's willy nilly. Workplaces simply don't work like that. Everyone is going to call in sick if the boss is whacking their cube mates out of plot convenience.The action bits make this certainly watchable and the scenery is nice (except for that graffiti hellhole Berlin. Seriously Germans clean that up will you. Nobody is impressed). The acting is decent and entertaining. Only real shame is the plot is such an incomprehensible silly mess."
" Smokey and the Bandit: The Bourne Chronicles
",0.0,0.8776,2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"Having admired the first three Bourne movies, I was excited about watching Jason Bourne. But I was sadly disappointed as the movie progressed.The scenes in Athens were quite compelling, and all credit to the CIA for having their own camera crew positioned wherever Jason is located. I can only imagine it would cause cost overruns given the overtime work of these crews that are available 24/7 wherever Bourne travels. But then the rest of the movie seemed to be like Smokey and the Bandit mashed up with any of the Fast and the Furious flicks. Sure, the special effects were convincing, but what about plot exposition? Deputy Dewey, sorry Director Dewey was played by Tommy Lee Jones, and I can only imagine how his elimination would be explained to the Congressional oversight committee."

What happened to the smart operatives?The chase scenes were so stupid that my wife left to put a load of laundry in during the ridiculous swat truck chase (Could have done it with a train that had a snowplow on it).The super villain was stupidly reckless and the CIA is filled with evil people, yet the good guys come from the same place? The best part of the movie is that little something he recorded at the end.I hate it when somebody takes a movie, and takes what made it good over the top.I have always liked Matt Damon and wish him well, but this director did not do you justice.Glad I got it for a $2 rental.

" Bourne. Jason Bourne.
",0.0,0.9975,2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"When it was announced that a new Bourne movie was coming, I was giddy with excitement. Trailers looked fine - and then the reviews started pouring in. Oh boy. But to be honest? For the most part Jason Bourne does work. It is NOT a terrible movie, as many here seem to claim. Let me explain.The soundtrack is good. Not too on the nose, not too forgettable. Well shot, at wonderful locations, each being distinctively different. The casting and acting is wonderful. The script worked well given the thankless job of continuing a story that was done. It extended the Bourne lore with additional revelations and back story. It's not perfect, not as smart as previous installments, but does the job. The set pieces and big action scenes are mostly spectacular. So what went wrong?One criticism I've seen here was that Bourne used to plan his actions much more, and now he doesn't. Sort of, but it's not bothering me too much. In the previous movies he is more of a driving force, while here he is forced into action by Parsons. And to be honest, he is still planning ahead, though more does happen by chance - to which he adapts in an instant. Classical Bourne. When he sees an opportunity he seizes it. He still connects the dots. It stays believable, I still buy that he is a super spy.However in two and a half key areas the movie IMHO falls apart.The appeal of Bourne has always been the writing, and the realism. For some odd reason we buy this super spy, brawly but with brains, a masterful chess player. The tech, while certainly spy stuff, stayed believable. And Jason Bourne for the most part tries to follow the trodden path. That makes it so much more jarring when (spoilers) the CIA hacker hacks into a phone to erase files on a computer that's off the internet. It's good that the computer is offline, anything else wouldn't be believable in that moment. But while after watching the movie I recalled some pretty amazing research work that might explain it if advanced several years into the future, the movie makes NO attempt at selling the concept to regular audiences. Thus I was pulled out of the movie. That truly wireless hacking may be barely acceptable for 007, but not Bourne. People have too much of a grasp of what is possible for hackers. Oh, and did I mention the malware on the thumb-drive, which, simply by being there - Bourne doesn't even run it! - manages to send the CIA the exact location, down to the house number? In less time than it takes a GPS receiver to get location data out in the open, let alone inside a building? On a computer that doesn't have GPS, let alone internet connection? Does Greengrass think we are brain-dead? And there is also a particularly violent/painful moment, that is survived by that character. How? I mean, seriously. HOW? And it wasn't even necessary. Maybe Tony Gilroy could have fixed the script, but alas he sadly wasn't involved. Just keep in mind what Gilroy was able to do in the same situation as Greengrass and Rouse, but without getting to use Matt Damon/Bourne?And the second area? Action. I always loved how Greengrass does action. It was intense, fast, and you could still follow it. He was one of a few directors who could pull the frantic shaky cam style off. The Waterloo station scene in Ultimatum is my favorite action scene ever. But somehow Greengrass seems to have lost it in this movie. For one, there seemed to be less shaky cam, but more long lenses. The Greece riot scene is good, but it feels like with such a great backdrop it could have done more. Don't get me wrong, it was beautiful, but somehow the pacing didn't feel right, and it just feels a little lacklustre. And then the final chase sequence. I've watched a behind the scenes featurette showing how they shot it (without commentary, cuts or anything). And it was amazing. Mind blowing. Wonderful. A beautifully choreographed ballet of destruction and near misses, done in one go, not shot by shot (which makes it more impressive). And what ended up on the big screen? A mess, shot on ridiculously long lenses and with no tension. If the car fills the entire screen it might as well be stationary (it wasn't though!). With no backdrop or sense of location it just doesn't work. Now, I would understand what ended up on screen if this had been a low budget production that had tried to fake what didn't happen. But it DID! At high speed, not at 20 km/h. I saw it. It was marvelous! The editing was... well I can't say terrible, but at times bad, as pointless shots are inserted at the wrong moment - yeah, I'm talking about you, ""look at Bourne through a steering wheel""- shot! Despite all of that it was still an entertaining and almost ridiculous action scene. Imagine Fast and Furious levels of car action you'd actually believe, done without CGI! But how much better could it have been if someone had given Greengrass a wide angle lens and a less frantic editor? It's sad when brilliant people who should know better, who've done much better, screw up like this. When they start imitating those who copied them in the first place, without the talent.Finally, 2 1/2: Politics. Now, I'm liberal, anti-surveillance, pro- Snowden, ... and yet I think it went too far. It was too on the nose. Clearly Greengrass has an agenda, and boy does he want you to agree with him. Especially in the first half it seriously lacks subtlety, and it hurts the movie. Captain America: Civil War deals with the same subject, and does it so much better."
" Jason ""Boring""
",0.0,-0.7856,2017-01-07 00:00:00,4,"Lots of boring talking, driving, more talking, sitting, more talking. Stupid dialog. Did I mention this movie is boring. The nonstop music score I guess is supposed to create 'tension' and 'suspense' but instead it was really really annoying. The first chase scene was so boring I kept wishing they would crash already. What's happening in this movie, what is the plot, who cares. Jason Bourne, the invincible fighter with memory issues and there is some big secret that no one cares about. And how stupid the CIA is portrayed in this movie. The characters just standing around saying stupid things. The play by play directions ""He's going left, he's going right, bravo 2.....""more annoying music, I'm getting a headache, now my husband has fallen asleep. So glad I did not go see this in theaters. I am mad I watched it for free."
" Just like the later Rambo. And both remind me of Any Which Way You Can... or was it Loose?

Garbage.I might buy the others crashes were necessary, but that one he went out of his way to be a d!$k.After all this time you still ask, ""how will I find you?""?

" Unrealistic, same tired storyline
",-0.4404,-0.6106,2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"I am a big fan of Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy. Felt Ultimatum required a bit too much Willing Suspension of Disbelief, and this movie picks up where Ultimatum left off in that department. There are moments that do feel Bourne-ish and it is kind of entertaining to watch in a brainless way. Hence 5 stars. There are certainly worse movies out there. But Jason Bourne is simply too unrealistic, the primary villain storyline is the exact same as Movies 1-3, there is no real character development on anybody's part (and what development that's attempted is thin, the moments of reckoning are rushed or nonexistent, and the personal transformations just don't make sense), and Bourne's magic intuition is completely not believable. Damon is respectable in his role, and all other actors each give a good effort. Action/special effects/stunts are decent. Storyline is absolutely horrid."
" Pretty much what I expected from any fourth sequel
",0.4939,-0.2023,2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"I just watched ""Jason Bourne"", and as I hadn't read anything about it all, including who was in the cast, I had an open mind going into it. Of course there was the usual high octane action sequence to start it off, and I was reminded of the inherent formula behind this franchise. As the cast revealed itself I was impressed at the top notch talent that appeared in this particular ""episode"". I wouldn't say that there were any miraculous performances, but taken in context, I certainly didn't expect any.The main reason that I'm writing this review is that I saw what other people had to say about the film, and the sheer disgust and utter disappointment that some of the viewers had expressed. I just think it's interesting that anyone would expect anything other than exactly what it is. It's the fifth Bourne movie, after all... It's not even an adaptation of a Ludlum book. The screenplay was based on known characters from the series."
" Disappointing to say the least
",-0.4939,-0.9169,2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"I am a huge fan of The Bourne series but this was a disappointment from start to finish. It felt like that one last drink you had last night at that party which you really didn't need and it made you sick and kind of ruined the rest of the night for you. I still absolutely love the pentology (except for this one of course) but this is just a bad movie in whichever category you're evaluating it in. My personal advice is don't watch it because you will never get those 2 hours of your life back, yes it's that bad. Another thing i noticed is that this movie brings nothing new to the series as it just brings no new ""tricks"" to the series, it's just awful."
" Must I Be The Only One Who Sees The Artists' Message?
",0.0,-0.2064,2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"My lands, you critics should look deeper! The 4th installment of the series brings it home. Previous episodes were play-action stories, for the most part taking place in obscure theaters of activity. This one brings to the viewer serious questions about privacy and citizen surveillance. I saw nothing contrived about that message.When I picked-up the rental, I also wondered whether there was enough unanswered questions to make this worthwhile. Well, there sure was. To avoid spoilers, I must be a bit vague, but this story had me guessing the whole time. One character has you puzzled over motives. Another sounds reasonable, while spewing evil. Intentions are found to have multiple layers with yet another character. The B.Ultimatum had a 4-layer chase. This one has a nice multi- dimensional chase too, and for a change of pace we have Bourne bearing down on his prey.Between this and the TV series, Person of Interest, someone in Hollyweed is trying to warn us about something.My favourite Bourne. Come for the action, then think about the message."

" Jason Corn
",0.0,-0.3396,2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Have the Bourne films overly influenced D. Trump? He and V. Putin must have the boxset. After this instalment I again wonder who the good guys in the world are supposed to be and feel that everyone is out to destroy someone or thing, including the drivers behind this project to flog an apparently dead horse.A thin tale of bullies and cyber bullies with lashings of chases and fights, conflating all kinds of fact and fiction. Chunky Bourne again played by Damon is drawn out of the shadows by director Greengrass, sorry, a sudden reawakened longing to establish the reason for his existence now and previous, and a recollection of his fathers' death finally established by a jpg. If corny music had been added and the violence reduced the film's premise would've been on a par with a soapy storyline from Neighbours or Dallas. Treadstone has surely been well trodden by now? The nice people at the CIA in the US show how damn clever they are by deleting those files he was looking at in Berlin by linking up to a non-smartphone. The millions of destructive dumb nutters in the world can breathe easy with US security busy chasing its tail as portrayed here. The UK DVD warns of ""moderate violence"" but neglects to warn of ""excessive brutality"". While the product placement won't influence me to go out and get another Dell laptop, oh no! The acting was generally believable, especially so with Vikander but craggy Jones' character was the King of Bland. The obligatory chase sequences are eye popping as usual, and those in Las Vegas now make those in Diamonds Are Forever look more akin to a stroll in the park. Although the final fight made me unintentionally laugh as the style has so quickly become so mimicked and clichéd.I enjoyed it overall as pure escapism sprinkled with forgivable plot holes – as I expected it was nowhere near as good as instalment #1 and still as engrossing (and grossing) as ever; but not as I expected, borderline corny. After all the destruction, to be constructive: It kept a lot of people in thought and in work for a while making it and a lot more people in pleasure watching it. As repeatedly adjured during the film, Copy that!"
