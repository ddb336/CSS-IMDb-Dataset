" Love BMS! Hated this!
",0.0,-0.2784,2020-09-30 00:00:00,1,"I remember watching this when it first came out, and I didn't really care for it. I just tried to watch it again, couldn't make it 20 minutes in. I'll always love the series, but they missed the mark on this big time"
" High school puberty
",0.0,0.2732,2020-08-13 00:00:00,1,"Supposed to be a comedy. Not even close to funny.
A bunch of students who never left high school puberty behind and went through college to reach the last senior year.
With all their stupid drugs, booze and sex fantasy one can ask how they got there..."
" Too much
",0.0,0.9119,2019-11-17 00:00:00,4,"The Rise of Thadland is a fantastic example of trying to make something a more extreme version of an already extreme concept. Another example of this is NPH as Barney in later seasons of HIMYA. When HIMYA found out people loved Barney, well they tried to make him more Barney-ish. It became very hard for the audience to view Barney as redeemable after this. When you make yourself a parody of yourself you risk becoming unrelatable and annoying.BMS took characters balancing on the edge and gave them a shove with a Mack truck. It was like adding speed to an energy drink and wondering what went wrong. All of your characters became like the extreme guys from Harold and Kumar, and nobody likes those guys."

" An anemic follow up to a great series
",0.6249,0.9263,2018-12-23 00:00:00,2,"Blue Mountain State was a series that was absolutely hilarious, celebrating the college campus drinking culture of many US establishments of higher education, bro culture, near complete disregard of women beyond their physical attributes and despite purportedly being about a football team a single game was seen across 3 complete series. Backed up by a cast of 1 dimensional characters the TV show BMS was a hedonistic feast for male 13-20 something viewers everywhere.The Rise of Thadland however did not capture this same magic in any respect. Although featuring that same cast of characters they seem slightly out of place in this new feature, hollow renditions of previously well loved caricatures. The plot of the film is simple enough and totally predictable in as many aspects of a traditional BMS episode. However where the TV show's plot lines were funny the film's felt as though a single BMS episode had been stretched to the 90 minute mark. Unfortunately such stretching left the film mostly mirthless and in many respects just plain sad as there weren't enough jokes to go around despite some brief moments of hilarity.Overall I give credit to the showrunners in trying to milk what was a very entertaining golden calf. However they ended up merely flogging a dead horse."
" Pointless film
",0.0,0.9479,2018-10-10 00:00:00,2,"Why build the hype? This movie felt like the cast had a big party and got some videos of some awful one liners. The plot is simple, Alex Moran is on verge of loosing the goat house so he goes to Thad to get help and Thad says he'll help only if Moran throws him this huge party. Then the entire second act is just the party. The whole Donnie being gay didn't move the story at all. There was no closure from the great series, the football team was in it for maybe two minutes. This film really didn't have a point and I can see why the show was canceled."
" The show was really good, the movie just went too far.
",0.4927,0.8704,2017-06-06 00:00:00,2,"As a fan of the show I was expecting more of the same -- low brow humour. With relatively low expectations going in, I have to say the movie exceeded my expectations in how bad it was. The story was over the top. I mean the whole party over football thing is great but I would've liked more football in the movie instead of a ridiculous story-line. Was actually expecting the movie to be about Alex Moran's final season at BMS and not about how the goat house had basically turned into a distopia. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because I was a fan of the show and it was nice to see the characters again. But yeah, this movie just stretched everything too far. That's all I have to say, don't waste your time with it, it may actually ruin the show for you."
" I wanted to like this movie.
",0.3612,0.9952,2017-03-10 00:00:00,2,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just wasn't what I expected after watching the series. I got into the show after it aired and I was happy to see that there was a movie to cap it off. I thought it would be a cherry on top of a sundae, this turned out to be an olive soaked in grenadine. The movie had some funny moments, drug induced hilarity, Thad screaming, and some typical Thad behavior. My issue is with the over the top stuff and the lack of show inspiration. The party was too ridiculous, the show had a lot of partying but it was not to this level. It felt like a stretched out party episode that just went too long. The show had a football centered plot, and this had little to no football. It relied too heavily on Thad and his comedy (while I loved Thad on the show, it is better for him to have limited screen time), and it made the other characters (main characters from the show) fall to the wayside. Alex and Sammy were completely different characters from what they were on the show, and Thad just became dumber. I liked that characters like Donnie and Harmon got more screen time, and it worked, but it felt like they had more time than both Alex and Sammy, who were the main characters on the show. I won't even get into how they ruined Coach and the whole Dean situation. Also taking it away from the original locations took me out of the movie quickly. Not having the actual GOAT HOUSE and the original field was really distracting, especially since they used a bright white house, when the original house was brown. Like I said, I wanted to love this movie like I did the show, I just couldn't enjoy it, mainly because it lost the spirit of Blue Mountain State."
