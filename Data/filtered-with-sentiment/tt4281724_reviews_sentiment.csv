" what I think about the moive Terrifier?
",0.0,0.8225,2021-04-10 00:00:00,10,"I love his work it is incredible, Terrifier the clown is unique and the best horror movie i have ever watched i hope to see more ❤"
" THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD
",0.4927,0.6652,2021-04-06 00:00:00,9,I have seen many horror movies but this one is one of the best thriller-scay movies . Go watch it it worhts.
" Disgusting fun!
",-0.1007,0.7964,2021-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Listen, if you're watching Terrifier looking for great acting, big budget production values and great writing, you're doing it wrong. If you're looking for a film that has a terrifying, murderous clown, blood and guts and a woman being hung upside down and getting sawed in half, you've come to the right place. This is shlocky, b-movie goodness at its best."
" This is just bad...
",0.0,-0.9195,2021-03-26 00:00:00,1,"With many stolen scenes from other movies, no plot line, no explainations or story, bad actors, and dumb things that make no sense, overall this film is just a waste of time to watch. It has gore but not in a good way, bad special effects and mistakes of where and what injuries happened and a scene where someone was bOnKeD like a literal meme. Wow it is bad."
" INSANELY Gory Love Letter to 80s Slashers
",0.6369,-0.9237,2021-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Terrifier is one of the scariest movies in the modern era of horror movies. In a time where cinema has toned down horror movies and made way to ghosts and demons, Terrifier is an insanely brutal and bloody throwback to the good old days. Speaking of blood and gore, this film has TONS of it. Again, I'd call it one of the bloodiest films in history. Everything is done practically and it looks amazing (Especially that one scene. If you know, you know)! Another highlight is the film's antagonist Art the Clown, AKA a horror movie icon in the making. He is played with perfection by David Howard Thornton, adding just the right amount of twisted black comedy to such a nightmarish character. However, the movie is not flawless. Aside from the gore effects and Art, everything else is mediocre. There is some plot holes (but they just may be unexplained and will be in future films), and at times the acting is awkward, and even a bit cringe worthy. But that almost adds to the campy 80s charm. And those elements are easily blown away by the good things. Terrifier is a brutal 80s slasher throwback, with a horrifying antagonist. Just don't watch if you have a weak stomach!"
" Low budget but slick
",-0.1406,0.969,2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,This is a throwback to gory movies from the 80s and it shows. But its done very well especially for the lower budget side of things. Good gorey bits and the guy playing the clown is great in the role. Yes they were doing good scary clowns here BEFORE pennywise made it all fashionable. Theres a dark sense of humor to this which makes the movie all the better. Check it out
" A truly wretched film
",0.4404,-0.9878,2021-03-14 00:00:00,1,How should how should I explain this film. It is probably one of the dumbest and you useless. Films I've ever seen in my life. Usually when it comes to horror there's a story a plot and narrative. But with this thing there's none of that. Just tons of body horror without any real story to speak of. And nudity and grotesque violence that's all there is. The film goes into some very dark and perverted and frankly sick Things. That when I witnessed some of these things. It truly made me realize just how evil it was this was the worst film I have seen in a long time. Don't waste your time on it don't even look at it
" Terrifying. No, really!!
",-0.7568,-0.6136,2021-03-01 00:00:00,5,Weak actings and ambiance. I expected much more from Art's debut. It doesn't even feel like Halloween.
" The Villian makes this move GREAT!
",0.729,0.5977,2021-02-13 00:00:00,7,"This was obviously a very low budget film, but ultimately I was impressed with what Damien Leone was able to pull off. David Howard Thorton does such an exceptional job at playing Art the Clown. He has you captivated every single move he makes. The kills (One in particular... you all know what I am talking about) were extremely memorable, and I can't wait to see more from the Terrifier gang!!"
" Art for Arts sake

" A majestically moronic and momentarily marvelous splatter movie!
",0.126,-0.7081,2021-01-26 00:00:00,6,"Killer, laughing-on-the-outside clown slices up skeezey chicks for sleazy kicks and bodacious blood drizzles!And Lickety Split! Artless Art puts his big ol' knife right up her...."
" Terrifier A Low Budget Horror That Is Great
",-0.1779,-0.9497,2021-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Terrifier is a low budget Horror movie that came out in 2016 in the USA and it came out in the UK in 2018. The movie is about these two girls who are hunted and stalked and then killed by a killer clown on Halloween Night the clown being named Art the Clown.
The effects of the movie are very well made for a low budget Horror movie since it is mostly practical effects like in one of the scenes one of the characters stabs Art in the leg and that was practical when it comes to Horror most fans would probably say that practical effects are the best witch I agree with.
Art the clown is a very different type of Slasher Killer he does not have much of a back story or anything like that he does not talk but is creepier with the facial expressions he uses his smile is very unnerving he does not just look out for his victims he finds people who are out at night and stops at nothing to kill them using any weapons he could find or weapons that that he takes with him.
The tow characters that Art goes after mainly are more there to just be his victims then survivors as we learn nothing about them just that they are friends and are out on this Halloween night but end up being stalked by Art the clown and then they are attacked by him both being murdered. One of the girls has a sister who comes to find her who in turn is chased by Art and attacked but she does survive but is very disfigured. At the biggening of the movie we see this girl's sister kill a news reporter as she was making fun of the way she looked.
In conclusion the movie is very well made for its low budget it just goes to show that you do not need a very high budget to make a good horror movie. The effects the story the characters are great, but Art is the centre piece of the movie as he is shown as this very unstoppable force within this world and if you did not know there is a sequel in the works so I for one can does not wait for that as a horror fan and to review it on my YouTube channel."
" Boring...
",0.0,0.4659,2021-01-17 00:00:00,3,"First of all, I enjoyed the mask and the acting of the creepy clown.
But that´s all, I can't even tell if there was a story or what´s the background story, motivation of the clown. Also there are some plot holes in the story, that it is at least sometimes hard to follow.
So if you are into the usual jump scares and some slauther of people, which one can see in x different movies in a better quality, go for it. But I´m quite sure that you -like me- will have a look at watch and ask yourself how long will this movie take, not because of the horror but because of the boredom."
" A genuinely creepy clown!
",0.0,0.8983,2021-01-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie was unconventional in many ways, particularly pertaining the characters, which made many parts unexpected and thus not necessarily predictable.This was way better than I thought and as I say, the clown was super creepy! He gave me nightmares LOL!"
" Disappointing attempt at the genre
",-0.4939,0.7619,2021-01-04 00:00:00,3,"First off, I have to say that the opening title is pure genius. A poster quality image that reminded me of the 1979 classic 'The Zombie Flesh Eaters' for some reason. It really gave some idea of just how gritty and surreal a journey you were about to embark on. Unfortunately, that promise is the best the film had to offer me.Personally, I didn't find Art the Clown terrifying. I thought he looked silly. I started questioning why it was even called Terrifier. I don't know, It just felt like the whole movie was trying too hard to be best in class, and it failed for me. I wasn't feeling the insane killer clown, more just your common garden variety insane person, who writes on walls with faeces, wearing a clown outfit. I found his movements to be too contrived and done purely for effect. I didn't find the gore to be realistic. I could see flaws in the gore make-up. It had the gritty look and atmosphere, but again, it felt contrived. I guess this was a homage to earlier movies, so I'll leave it there.I give it 3 stars for the opening movie title (which truly is a classic image put up on screen) and the promise of what this movie could have been."
" Great if you Love Gore
",0.8519,-0.7774,2021-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Terrifier is a great movie if you watch movies strictly for the gore instead of the plot line. There's really no rhyme or reason for what is happening throughout the movie. The acting is sub par, and the characters can be pretty dumb, but if you want to watch a movie strictly for the kills and gore, look no further than this movie."

" Too dumb to live, apparently.
",-0.5106,-0.9706,2021-01-01 00:00:00,5,"Do you ever watch a slasher film and the characters make SO MANY DUMB CHOICES that you stop hoping they'll get out of it and hope they're put out of their misery instead?Yeah, this movie is like that.Art the Clown is a plus because he is truly terrifying-great costume/makeup and great characterization on his part. But the victims ultimately committed the sin of making me not care if they lived or died. They weren't bad concepts, just poorly executed (no pun intended). The film harkens back to some traditional slashers in the mystery of who the killer and his motivation, so that doesn't bother me at all for a slasher film, but the characters' dumb choices are awful no matter the kind of film."
" It's absolutely terrifying!
",-0.6468,-0.9912,2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,It's Halloween. Dawn the blonde and Tara are going back home after a night out drinking. Before that they stopped by a pizzeria and saw the terrifier. They left and the clown killed the two man and one of the guys head was on the counter burning like a big candle. Then they noticed the cars tire had been slashed and Tara called her sister Vicky to come over to pick them up. They waited in the car in front of a creepy old warehouse. Tara needed to go to the bathroom and asked the guy smoking in front of the building. She saw a lady with a doll thinking she's her daughter. The guy was an exterminator and there for the rat infested warehouse. The clown was back and she ran into the basement. She was bound to a chair with duct tape and dawn was there upside down. It tore dawn in half with a saw from the crotch to head and Tara managed to run away. It knocked the exterminator guy out and the doll lady found it with the doll in its hands. She seemed to convince it of giving the doll back but it ripped her hair and breasts off and they were both naked when And then he stabbed the second exterminator guy coming in the head. And then shot Tara in the head multiple times. Vicky arrived and the clown replied her messages saying come around from the back. She entered the building and saw the bodies. and then Vicky found them. It acted like a woman when Tara hid in a closet. It looked extremely creepy with the woman's hair and breasts. The rats were all around and it was disgusting. Finally she found Tara sitting in a chair dead and almost got killed before the exterminator hit it in the head. They called the police but didn't wait and moved on. It crushed his face and Vicky managed to run but it hit her with a truck and ate her face while policemen arrived. And it shot itself in the head before getting arrested. It was sth supernatural because in the morgue it also killed the coroner it was alive! And one year later Vicky was discharged from the hospital with her disfigured face. In the opening scene they showed us Vicky was on tv and she killed the woman because she mocked her appearance behind cameras on the phone. I would watch tens of sequels of this. It was a whole lot better than I expected it to be.
" Little Lackluster
",0.0,0.1073,2020-12-02 00:00:00,5,"The character of Art the Clown is definitely a good addition to a long list of cinematic horror characters such as Pinhead and Myers.He is suitably creepy, unstable and quirky.But...the movie itself was a little dull and surprisingly slow. The story is incredibly simple (which is fine) and the kills are somewhat entertaining. However it lacks punch and any true scares that would warrant a higher score.Worth a look but no classic :)"
" Wish there was more... And less
",0.4019,-0.9685,2020-11-21 00:00:00,1,"Terrifier is the MOST disgusting movie I've ever seen for the following reasons: He ate a girl's face, he sawed a girl in half as her friend was watching, and he dressed up in girl skin.
Also, there is no plot whatsoever, there's no backstory to Art the Clown and there's no decent ending. Cool, he got ""arrested"" but he came back to life? What is that? Is he Michael Myers but Pennywise at the same time? I don't get it. It'd be nice to have at least a backstory, same with the Cat Lady! Why is she homeless? Why does she carry a doll? Is the doll a baby she lost? Why does she want to be a mom so badly? She deserves her own movie.
I hated the flickering lights as well... I walked away with the most disgusting feeling of myself for what I just witnessed and a pounding migraine from the flickering lights at the end."
" Omg pls no pls

Bro what could they have spent that money on I could have made a better movie with a Halloween costume and my IPhone camera. Watching this movie is like having your eyes burnt out."

" The only people praising it are low IQ gorehounds
",0.34,-0.9754,2020-10-26 00:00:00,3,"Directed by Damien Leone, Terrifier is a B-slasher film based off of a segment in the 2013 anthology film, All Hallow's Eve. Let me start off by saying that my expectations for this were slightly high to say the least. That being said, I gave it a watch, and I honestly found myself quite intrigued; at least, during the first fifteen minutes. But after the second act, I virtually stopped giving a damn.From what I've heard, there was quite a lot of hype surrounding this flick. But after having watched the whole thing, I really can't see how that's possible. All it is is an hour-long splatter-fest. Don't get me wrong though, I didn't hate it ... at first, and that had to do with the two central girls, Tara and Dawn. Now I will agree with everyone on the platform that Dawn was pretty annoying, and I knew the moment she appeared onscreen that she was going to get axed off. Tara on the other hand was the one who stood out the most for me. I was in fact rooting for her every time she appeared onscreen. But as soon as she herself got put to rest, I (like many others) felt completely cheated.So right after Tara gets axed off, the rest of the film focuses on her sister, Vicky, whom (believe it or not) we no jack about. She of course survives at the end as the only thing she contributes to is being the hideously disfigured young woman shown in the very beginning.And last but certainly not least is David H. Thornton as Art the Clown. All I can say is that this man clearly gave it his all in this role, especially during the restaurant scene. That being said though, as menacing as Art was, he isn't interesting ... at all. I will go so far as to compare him to the titular clown from Stitches. As boring and dumb as that movie was, said character at least had some funny one-liners and used his special CLOWN POWERS to murder all of his victims. This is more than I can say for Art as all he does is walk and sit around with that stupid creepy smile and uses the generic serial-killer tools to chop up and slice his victims; he also uses a gun at one point which is apparently more significant than I make it out to be.All that being said, do yourself a favor and avoid this one, unless you're an edgy teen or adult who just wants to see a bunch of pointless dimwits get sliced and diced. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that this is literally a gorno. After all, I've seen a whole bunch of reviewers praise it simply for it's bloody effects and sadistic killer and nothing else.I've also seen comments arguing that ""It's supposed to be tongue-in-cheek"" and ""It's a throwback to the 70s-80s slasher films."" Again, do yourself a favor and watch Scream instead. When I watch a slasher film, I'm not watching it just to see helpless people get stabbed to death. I want to see depth, I want someone to root for. And if you seriously say that you were rooting for Art the clown the whole time, I seriously question your mentality.All in all, the people calling this the ""best slasher and/or scariest movie to date"" just for its GRUESOME CONTENT (and/or simply because of its antagonist) really need to learn the difference between horror and SHOCK VALUE. With that said, I rate it 3.5/10."
" Serious horror fans, do not pass on this one

" Not that Terrifying... just a bit, misunderstood
",-0.34,-0.9895,2020-09-02 00:00:00,5,"Directed and written by Damien Leone, this 2016 film runs at 82 minutes and is classed as a Horror/ Thriller film. It primarily stars David Howard Thornton as Art, the killer clown. For the purpose of the film though, we follow Jenna Kanell as Tara Heyes, and then Samantha Scaffidi as her sister, Victoria. Catherine Corcoran plays Tara's best friend Dawn, while Pooya Mohseni and Matt McAllister also play substantial parts too.It's Halloween; Tara and Dawn are on their way back from their night out. While at their car they see a clown, but they think nothing of it and debate who is the least drunk so that they can drive. They decide to stop at a pizza place to get some food to absorb the booze; it is here they meet the clown again. When they return to the car they find that a tire has been slashed, while they wait for help from Tara's sister, Tara herself goes into a nearby building to use a toilet. By this time, Art's bloody rampage has already begun. Will the girls be able to survive the killer clown?The premise of this film is simple; it's a hide-and-seek style slasher film that's in one building; people can get into the building, but can't get out. There is a lot of blood and gore throughout. There is mild use of bad language, and one scene of partial nudity. This film never really tires to be anything other than what it is - a slasher film. There are moments that it appears dumber than it needs to be and some things seem hard to believe. Characters who seem to be crippled or killed are suddenly able to run around again at times. It's hard to work out if there is some supernatural element to the film due to the wounding Art takes and then comes right back to the fight as if nothing happened. He also displays lots of strength at times too, especially in hoisting up CorCoran's Dawn character. The inclusion of some characters made no sense, other than presumably to add to the kill count. Also, the wrap-around which stars and ends the film seems pointless and not needed.The acting is average without ever being stand-out, sometimes it's wooden and un-emotive and sometimes it's over acted and cheesy. David Howard Thornton does well as Art the clown; I'd suggest that his background of mime and playing other clowns has helped here. The pace of the film is mostly good, but when it slows down it trudges rather than flows. There is no character development, no back story, no reasoning. There was a lot of potential in the film, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to the promise. This felt like a bad slasher movie from the 80's where events just happen and nothing is really explained. It's better than some of the bad horror movies from the same year with similar budgets, but it's still only ever going to be an average film when it feels like it was aiming to become a cult film, which it is not. Decent cheap film for late night cable channels, but I really can't see this lasting the test of time. 5 out of 10."

However, there's one scene in this movie that makes me so damn uncomfortable I kind of wish I had never watched it in the first place. I went get into too much detail but it involves a naked woman, a chainsaw, and being sawed through an unholy place. Good lord that image still haunts my brain."
" Cliche, the Movie.
",0.0,-0.9601,2020-08-20 00:00:00,3,"This movie is a slog to get through after the first 10 minutes.
It tries so hard to be an old school slasher flick, but misses all the charm that those movies had. I ended up watching it over the course of two days, because after 45 minutes it had felt like I had been sitting there for 90. When Netflix told me there was still another 45 or so to go I just NOPED and shut it off. (I did finish it the following day).It is very rough, with the only writing being cliches to the point you can literally count down to ""and this is going to happen in three... two... one..."" and be correct. The acting for the most part is dreadful, leaving really no one to root for by the end.
Characters make dumb decisions, and die painfully. Some of the kills are quite original, and the gore is really well done for the indie budget film this is.The only upside to the flick is David Howard Thornton's portrayal of Art the Clown- who will terrify with his facial expressions, movements and presence. However even that does save the movie."
" I have mixed feelings about this one.
",0.0,-0.963,2020-08-19 00:00:00,5,"This is a low-budget grindhouse horror film and I generally like these kind of movies when they're done right. You don't need a big budget to make a good horror film. Unfortunately, the bad acting and lack of a storyline puts you in a state of mind in which you don't care about the victims at all so you don't care when they die some horrific death. The one redeeming quality of this movie is the absolutely terrifying and creepy Art the Clown. He's more disturbing than any horror villain I can think of, even iconic ones like Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger, hence the mixed feelings about this flick. I'm glad I watched this movie and I'll never forget Art the Clown, but I probably won't ever watch it again because everything else about it is completely forgettable"

I don't mind a movie that's gory, but at least have a COHERENT storyline. Definitely don't recommend this and would recommend people to watch Hostel or SAW if they're into gore because those movies have a coherent and captivating story instead of this garbage."

The plot is simple and, to be honest, not a lot really transpires beyond creepy clown being creepy. I won't spoil anything, but don't go into this looking for anything more than a creepy clown movie. Where this movie ABSOLUTELY shines is the gore and effects. Yes, the clown is amazing, but the gore effects are phenomenal (and graphic). So while I give this movie a 4ish overall on plot (etc), it deserves an extra star for the clown, twisted stuff, and effects."

The film has zero story line, piss poor acting, and the most overuse of gore in such a generic and unscary way, this film is so predictable its sad. And this film sets the record for most cliches in a horror movie and one of the dumbest protagonist in history.
Terrifier has no suspense, no fright, and in no way at all is this a good film.
Please if you gave this a good review please never review a film again. You don't know anything about it."

" Fun, Silly, and Terrifying.
",-0.0772,0.9602,2020-07-26 00:00:00,8,"A lot of viewers take movies, especially horror movies, too seriously. Some try to find what it means, or how it portrays to our lives or others around us. Although the profession is important and is what can help progress us as a society, Terrifier is a perfect example of what movie industries sometimes need to strive for. Instead of creating big blockbuster movies with fifty-million dollar budgets, Terrifier transcends that with a cast of nobodies and has fun with a small budget. It's timeless feel and the laughable ditziness of characters makes it to be a fun, entertaining movie. Although far too gory, the intentions and execution of the director make a movie captivating, engaging, and scary."

" Sort of Gross
",-0.4767,-0.9574,2020-07-11 00:00:00,4,"How much you enjoy Terrifier depends on how compelling you find the design of the main villain, because he's the star of the show here. This is one of the film's main faults, because what's truly terrifying in short glimpses becomes almost comical when you keep seeing it in garish light.None of the other characters make much of an impact and they're unfortunately not immune to making typical dumb horror movie character mistakes and lapses in logic. There's also a far too long scene of the villain splitting a totally nude woman in half that felt utterly disgusting (and not in a good way). I'm not usually one to call out slasher flicks for misogyny, but there was something particularly ugly about that scene."

",0.5106,0.4019,2020-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Terrifier is a low budget, clown slasher film, which certainly delivers well on everything it promises. It's packed full of gory, violent deaths and has a mute killer clown at the centre of it all. The fact that Art the clown doesn't speak at all in the film, and is extremely creepy adds to the overall scariness of the film. Tension is built very well, and the eerie music leaves you awaiting nervously the next scare. The death scenes and the gore are spot on and perfectly executed, it's just the character building which slightly lacks. But this film is everything you'd expect and definitely is worth the quite short running time of around 80 minutes. Definitely watch if you would like a scary film that really does make you jump."

I also liked how Art the Clown did not talk; which separate from other horror clowns that do. However the plot was awful. Definitely low budget. Just random kills, no aim or direction of Art the Clown. He's simply an aimless homicidal maniac."

The gore is good. But the storyline is pretty much non existent."
" Copious gore and dark humor make this grindhouse B-movie worth the watch
",0.4588,0.6057,2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"To pull off many scenes in Terrifier, most of the people involved in its making have to fall on the sadist spectrum--which is great news for us gorehounds. Filmed with a budget of just $100,000, Terrifier is surprisingly impressive and entertaining.There isn't a complicated story here. Terrifier doesn't need one. The film basically follows a day-in-the-life of the homicidal mischief-maker, Art the Clown, as he causes shenanigans that end in a laudable kill count. If you like splatter films, you'll love this. As expected on a budget like this, sometimes things fall short; the acting, while competent and better than most films of this caliber, leaves much to be desired when people are screaming (I never believed these people were actually in danger or pain). Sometimes you can tell the practical effects are special effects, if only because bony body parts ""squish"" a little too much or open cavities have an absence of chunky viscera. The film never scared me, and the gore never felt overly realistic, but it's amazing that Terrifier has better kills than the vast majority of modern horror films with a fraction of their budgets. The third on-screen kill of the movie is quite possibly the most gruesome and dementedly creative I've ever seen put to film. Kudos!Terrifier's shining star is Art the Clown, played by David Howard Thornton, an ex-mime in real life who is having so much fun in the role. I need more of this character! Art combines his sadistically brutal murder methods with dark humor by mocking victims with dances, creepy-cheesy grins, and child-like little waves that had me grinning and chuckling out loud quite a few times. He is quite the little stinker, and I found myself rooting for him just to see more.I hope to see Art the Clown return in future films. Until then, Terrifier entertained me with its unique mix of copious gore and dark humor more than other B-movies of its type have, and I recommend it to anyone with the stomach for splatter and gorno films. Special shout-out must go to James A. Janisse from the Dead Meat YouTube channel, whose video on Terrifier talking about its kills got me to put this on my watchlist."
" Great 80s slasher vibe clown film
",0.6249,0.977,2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,"This is definitely the film for you if you love gory/slasher 80s-style film. While the acting isn't that bad, and the story is pretty basic, it's relatively decent. Art the Clown is a sadistic mute clown. He has no background story as to why he is the way he is... which makes him more scary. He's one of the scariest clowns I've come across in movies. The music is pretty good. This gets extremely gruesome pretty fast, so beware of that, and don't eat anything while watching this. I find this to be rewatchable and a great movie for Halloween-time. The ending is pretty crazy too! Definitely check it out!"

This movie is very creepy and full of terror, the clown makes for a good antogonist. There a few great shots in this movie that really envoke a sense of gross-out horror. It would be too much of gross out for some. Those who can handle it will welcome Art into the rank of seriously creepy clowns."

A clown chases and kills a bunch of characters we don't care about. The gore is so over the top, it could have worked as a comedy if it wasn't so mean spirited.At this point, I think people are so tired of CGI, they are willing to give positive scores to any movie using practical effects 'like the good old days'."

Made like an old 80s slasher flick, but unfortunately the effects and props were also from the 80s. Props looked fake.
Many people find clowns creepy, so great start. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver.
Also the characters show the audience what not to do if being chased by a psychopath. Stupidity kills."

I would also wish for more charachter development as the situations of the characters such as the mother were not entirely explained.The deaths are good and creative and there are lots of jump scares and suspense.

" Sleazy junk
",0.0,-0.9562,2020-03-04 00:00:00,2,"TERRIFIER is a filmic spin-off from an indie horror anthology called ALL HALLOWS' EVE. One of that film's segments featured a sadistic clown murdering women so here we have the same ""plot"" for an hour and a half. I might have appreciated this kind of back-to-basics slasher format back in the 1980s, but nowadays it just seems trite and sleazy, a film seemingly made by morons for morons. A mute clown wanders around, indestructible as usual, and kills everyone else in the film off. Plenty of effort has gone into elaborate and nasty gore effects, but there's no discernable characterisation, wit, plot, atmosphere, suspense or viewer involvement. In addition, the scene of the naked girl being dismembered goes way beyond the boundaries of good taste. Not for me."

I feel it is meant to leave you disturbed on just how warped this killer clown is and I feel it succeeds at that! Gives me hatchet vibes along with a creepy clown in the mix. This movie just has a select audience and I feel does a great job for being a low budget splatter show.

I've been a fan of hardcore-gore however, struggle with finding good movies but Terrifier is the best i've seen in the entire horror genre. The cinematography is excellent for a small budget horror. Art the Clown definitely a silent killer which made me enjoy him more as most horrors like West Cravens Scream and The nightmare on elm street they have speaking killers so i do find some occasions the body-language is terrible. The acting in this movie isn't the best but suits the low-budget vibe as most big-budget horrors are over the top acting and gore.I highly commend the cast and crew for creating this timeless classic of the 21st century. If you enjoy bloody gore with guts, and saw like kills this movie is for you. However, i didn't rate it 10/10 as same parts I expected jump-scares and i fell slightly bored.Goodluck if our scared of clowns this will defs make my fear of clowns more gruesome."
" Nasty little slasher
",-0.5574,-0.4699,2019-12-18 00:00:00,7,"This one really took me by surprise: for a film made in 2016, it had a feel of a production from the 70s/80s to it. It is basically a B movie without looking really cheap like a lot of them do. It owes a lot to Herschell Gordon Lewis with a lot of over-the-top blood and guts and not bothering with any explanation why Art the Clown goes around and simply kills everyone. It also borrows quite a few bits from the early Halloween films, especially the last scenes.There aren't really any edge-of-the-seat scenes and scenes that make you jump as right from the start it's clear that no one is safe but especially the latter makes it interesting: as soon as you think you know who the heroine/hero of the film is, she/he is usually slaughtered. This makes it difficult to identify and hope with any of the characters which is usually a staple of horror films, but that's also quite refreshing.As it is not that original, I wouldn't give it really high marks, but among all the disappointments that modern horror films usually are these days, this one is definitely entertaining."
" Anyone who rates this higher than a 5/10 probably has never seen a good movie.

However much of what happens in this movie is just too unbelievable and far fetched. I found myself forced to suspend disbelief way too many times during this film. The acting also goes way downhill as the film progresses. The scene near the end has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Also, be prepared to suspend disbelief because the location, near the end, isn't believable either (you can't put a flower in a room that looks like it's been left untouched since the early 1900s and expect people to buy that it's somehow a newer place that only needs a bit of construction). The acting in the beginning was okay for a B-horror movie and the clown was scary (he/she/it also stayed in character even if the rest of the movie sucked). If you want a good horror movie that's low budget then watch Splinter (2008)."
" Mindless

The main issue with this film is that it fails to be creepy or scary. It just comes off as unimaginative. With great thrillers like Midsommar and The Witch there is no reason to watch this. To be fair, the opening scene was well done."

Not for the effeminate type who can't handle graphic gore sequences and need an intricate plot to stay stimulated. It's simple and to the point but doesn't follow the typical horror cliques. Top notch practical gore FX by director Damien Leone and Art the Clown played by David Howard Thornton was absolutely amazing. Art the Clown is the newest horror icon!"

Almost using a hatchet, then not, to see the terror on someone's face is more nerve-racking than burying it in their head."

Not to mention a grab-bag of creative weaponry that he has no compunctions on using on his chosen victims, whether to kill them outright or to subject them to a prolonged torture session.I might add that this movie has no problem with breaking the rules of conventional horror movies, so those of you expecting a particular outcome at certain points might be in for a surprise.This movie should be a Halloween standard, if it isn't already.

He just kept smiling while doing this terrible stuff.Loved the gore. It was very well done. The acting was pretty good for a low budget movie but this one is all about the cool kills. Can't wait to watch part two.
" So not a horror fan but decided to give this a shot
",0.1344,-0.9897,2019-10-18 00:00:00,5,"*contains spoilers*So during Halloween as the years pass I decide to watch something scary to face my fears. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. This falls in the middle bc there were memorable scenes yet the movie as a whole is pretty forgettable.Memorable: the clown itself (Art was pretty scary looking and intimidating), one Mind boggling, frighteningly horrible scene in particular (ladies u know which one I'm referring to; even tho when I break down the mechanics of the scene it becomes less scary)The bad: everything else(there was absolutely no plot), purpose of the 1st victim killing the interviewer (y have her kill if it wasn't gonna further the plot), y make Art ""invincible"" and have him live AFTER we saw him with a self inflicted gun shot wound, the victims made multiple crucial errors (they had weapons & Art pinned down at least 3 times!), what was with all the poked out eyeballs?, how did he manage to inflict that much damage to the sister's face b4 the cops arrived?. All in all, outside of a few moments, I'm sure I'll forget this B level gory movie."
" Oh boy.
",0.0,-0.9517,2019-10-17 00:00:00,1,"The worst qualities of the slasher genre stripped down and focused into one violent and meaningless movie. Terrifier is not simply unsettling, but it is upsettingly cruel and, worst of all, predictable."
" The clown is terrifying
",-0.5719,-0.9406,2019-10-16 00:00:00,7,Yes it's low budget but that's what makes it so good. This movie is very brutal. The one killing I had to even turn away and I can handle just about anything. The clown is terrifying. He also appears in the movie All Hallows' Eve. If your into low budget horror you'll love this one. I read another is planned for 2020.
" SOLID 8/10
",0.3254,0.8555,2019-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Hear me out. I'm rating this high on a ""Horror Scale"" and going in without any expectations.I keep seeing this on my Netflix queue. The title ""Terrifier"" is so generic, it's laughable and I immediately judged the book by it's cover seeing a crazy clown guy felt comical and borderline try hard to me. But I digress...Movie was better than I expected! I have a thing for Halloween where I watch nothing but horrors. I decided to give it a try.Think 80's horror flick. There's no CGI. It's all heavy duty special effects. The people that do them in this movie should be awarded. This is one of the most gruesome horror movies i've seen to date. The deaths are absolutely brutal.The antagonist of the movie, The Clown aka Terrifier, lives up to it's name. The actor who plays him plays him very well. It's almost method acting as if he studied a mad man and clown to incorporate it all together resulting in this Terrifier character. Some of the things he does in this movie is downright hilarious in a creepy kind of way.Do yourself a favor. Watch this movie. You will not regret it. Like an 80's horror flick, it's a great time. I'm hoping I see more of this Terrifier! Really good for a B movie horror flick!"
" Art the Clown isn't just the Slasher we NEED... He's the Slasher we DESERVE!!!!
",0.0,-0.9814,2019-10-16 00:00:00,10,"Get ready to fall in love all over again...If you're anything like me and grew up in the late 80's and 90's... A time where horror movies consisted of unstoppable Slashers, full frontal shower scenes, and that creepy guy that always seemed to warn you that everyone was going to die if you proceeded onward... Then you're probably also in the same boat of missing those types of horror bobbydazzlers.Well, ladies and gentlemen... I present you with Art the Clown. Art is a demented, fecal smearing, tiny top hat wearing, horn honking, murderous clown that always seems to get the most enjoyment and pleasure from murdering his victims. He's raw, extremely violent, and has a wonderful taste for gore covered in more gore.As a slasher style horror movie villain, Art gives audiences everything they're looking for in a horror movie icon, but with a new, modern take on the role.
First of all, we have absolutely no idea where Art is from, how he got here, or even what he is for that matter... and not knowing just makes him all the more intriguing. And if that's not creepy enough for you... he's also a completely silent character. Yep, no talking from this guy; however, with his subtle movements and sinister grins he somehow embodies all the charisma of a young Freddy Kruger.
This is in a large part due to the amazing acting of David Howard Thornton as Art the Clown. Thornton is a huge fan of, not only the horror icon greats, but the like of such silent film stars as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Rudolph Valentino. His classic comedic acting style, alongside his creepy mannerisms, gives Art an identity like no other.So grab some popcorn, gummy bears, and that extra large cherry coke... then try to keep it all down as you watch Art stab, shoot, strip, skin, murder, maim, and massacre his way into the hearts of horror fans everywhere.***Side Note: Art Originally appears in the short film ""The Ninth Circle"" and the later short film ""Terrifier"" which are also must see films. If you can't find them on YouTube or floating around the net somewhere... You can catch both of them in their entirety in the horror anthology film ""All Hallows Eve.""I give Terrifier, and Art himself, a very loving 10 out of 10!!!!"

True gore and very bloody. If you want an OG style gore horror film this is it. They don't make 'em like this no more. The main character clown does an excellent job of being creepy af and plays his role amazingly. If you like blood & guts, this is for you. The clown is very creepy in a good way for a film like this. Give it a chance."
" A return to video nasty territory
",-0.5574,-0.9753,2019-09-18 00:00:00,4,"Ive been watching horror for about 35 years now and my fave genre is slasher which this defintely falls under however I found this to be all gore and no substance. Sure the practical effects are good for the budget and the kills creative (kind of) but there is absolutely no plot other than mute clown kills people. A lot of talk about Art the clown being a new horror icon. Not for me. This guy doesnt come anywhere close to Freddy, Jason or Michael and never will IMO. This is basically 90 mins of mindless violence which maybe 20 years ago id have been lapping up but they could have at least attempted a story here. My advice, watch the various kills on you tube Etc and skip to the next thing on your watchlist. A generous 4 for effects"
" Fun filled clown murder flick
",-0.34,0.7994,2019-09-18 00:00:00,6,"First off, this is not a great film technically speaking, but goddamn this movie is fun. Art the clown is seriously the coolest slasher villain we have had recently. He feels like a cool new through back to the 80s horror icons we love. This movie knows what it is and doesnt take its self to seriously, which is why it works. I think if the would have actually had good actors I wouldn't have anything to complain about. Well, I take that back the characters outside of Art could use some depth. But other than that, I really do love this movie"
" Better than I expected
",0.4404,-0.1926,2019-09-12 00:00:00,6,"I've seen better horror/slasher movies, but I've also seen much worse. I kept seeing this on Netflix and finally gave it a shot. My only complaint, and one part that didn't make sense was Tara gets shot in the face roughly 6 times and is dead. About 30 minutes later, her sister is in the warehouse and Tara has been scalped and had her torso sliced off, but she's alive telling Victoria to run?? Other than that, dude that plays Art did great with body language. His movements said more than any cheesy lines he would have been given."

" Disturbingly misogynistic
",-0.5106,-0.9921,2019-08-18 00:00:00,3,"First, the good points: Art the Clown is truly creepy. The mime aspect of the character add another level of creepiness beyond your typical murderous clown. The scene where Art stares at the girls in the pizza parlor is satisfyingly unsettling. The music, lighting, and cinematography are all good as well. It doesn't look or sound like a low-budget movie.Now the downsides. I found the violence in this movie to have a disturbingly misogynistic theme. The ways that women are dismembered and killed in this movie are very gender-specific, often involving female parts of the anatomy. On the other hand, the ways that Art kills and dismembers his male victims are very generic.Because we learn nothing about Art's motivations or back-story in the film, it's hard to see the gender-specfiic violence against women as an intentional plot point (I use the word ""plot"" very loosely with this movie). Rather, it seems more likely that the particularly brutal violence against women comes from conscious or unconscious misogyny on the part of Damien Leone, the film's writer and director.There is one particularly brutal female killing (you'll know it when you see it) that seems to highlight the identity of women as sexual objects. It's hard to imagine a director having a male victim killed in an equally sexualized manner.Even the film's opening scene reduces one of the film's strongest and most important female characters to a one-note caricature who is primarily concerned with the loss of her facial attractiveness. The pointless woman-on-woman violence is set up as a ""twist"" but in fact completely flattens the character who had the most potential for any bit of complexity. Did she really survive a brutal attack only to throw away her future by committing an impulsive attack on a woman she barely knows who insulted her appearance?In summary, come for the clown, and stay for the righteous feminist anger you'll feel at the treatment of the film's female characters."
" Very enjoyable movie

" Art is the New Boogeyman
",0.0,0.296,2019-08-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie is twisted, creepy, over the top, cringey, gory, and at times funny. When I was a kid, watching Halloween or Friday the 13th gave me a similar thrill as Terrifier does now. Art the Clown is bigger than life and badder than the devil. Good fun for horror buffs and a real low budget gem of a slasher film."
" So brutal OMG
",-0.659,0.2501,2019-08-14 00:00:00,8,"Couldn't finish it, couldn't get half way through and for that I commend it. It excels as a brutally gory slasher flick, with a very creepy killer. Not for me, but it does what it's supposed to do very well."
" Lol
",0.4215,-0.7246,2019-08-14 00:00:00,1,I like horrors but this movie is garbage. It's a B movie..to be honest it could've actually been better with better production and if the kills weren't so over the top..I think the kills being so over the top made it seem incredibly fake and lame. Seems like somewhat of a low budget SAW ripoff...like what if the little clown on the tricycle got up and started killing people. If you want a laugh watch it...but if you're looking for a good horror movie look somewhere else. It's a solid 1/10.
" Underrated
",0.0,0.5256,2019-08-13 00:00:00,8,"This movie was actually very entertaining despite being a low budget horror film.
It's very well acted and believable, especially Jenna Janell (Tara) who is excellent.
Camera angles and cuts are well done.
Genuinely scary and creepy."
" Who needs a plot?
",0.0,-0.2991,2019-08-10 00:00:00,9,"So there's not much of a plot. Hmm. This is a slasher flick, folks. The plot is this: it's Halloween night, and there's a maniac killer dressed like a clown on the loose. People get killed, there's lots of blood and guts, including a really nice money shot of a naked girl getting sliced in half. And there are hot girls too. What were you expecting, ""War and Peace""?It was edgy and done quite nicely with the dark, gritty 80s slasher flick effect. I also appreciated the tiny bit of comic relief when Art The Clown crapped all over bathroom in the pizzeria and the guy who handles food had to clean it up."
" Hilarious!
",0.4574,0.9904,2019-07-27 00:00:00,8,"That clown has some character! He's really refreshing from all the other evil clown movie villains.It's also cool that the movie cuts right to the chase. You know what you're in for and you're getting it. Classic slasher movie stuff. The suspense and the bar scene in the beginning of the film are the highlight of the whole movie for me.
Most of the acting was good too, which you wouldn't expect from a clearly low-budget horror movie. Both the clown and the main girl were really expressive and awesome.The pacing and writing weren't great though. You'd like the thing you're watching to make some sense but it doesn't. Does the clown have random supernatural abilities? Can we get some consistency? Better, more intriguing writing? I'd love to see that in Terrifier 2. Some character development that explains the clown's motives to kill would be nice. Nothing dragged on, just a bit of story. Because he's visually fantastic, but his reasoning, actions, abilities - hella underdeveloped. And at one point he used a gun which was ridiculously out of place.Overall it's definitely worth watching for slasher film fans as the actor who plays the clown is fantastic, giving that character an even better feel than high-budget clown murderers like IT, etc.Again, most of all I'd like to praise the man two actors. Brunette girl was fantastic and believable more so than protagonists in other slasher films and Art the Clown - deserves sequels up the butt."
" Her acting helps to kill it.
",-0.4767,-0.529,2019-07-25 00:00:00,2,"The bad acting makes this film hard to watch. There is this one burnette chick in here that can not act to save her life. That is the biggest drawback about these low budget deals, there are limited resources for special effects and stuff so when you have a fish mouth actor or actress who delivers nothing but flat lines, you notice it a lot more."

I was extremely frustrated watching this as the movie became a drag towards the second half. I think the scriptwriter should have focused only on the clown, Tara, Dawn, and Victoria."
" Terrifying

" Uniquely Twisted
",0.0,0.9333,2019-07-02 00:00:00,7,"A friend said they watched this movie alone, and it freaked them out... so of course I had to give it a go. I'm rating this movie 7 out of 10. Honestly, the acting was decent; the kills were awesome; and the level of creepy was on point. This movie featured some of the best kills I've seen in a long while in film, and I give them kudos for being inventive.The reason I personally am not scoring the movie higher is based on a few things that were flawed. I felt that sometimes the body props that were used during scenes were not proportionate, taking away from the realism. I also think they could have had the people who were the prey be smarter, making the chase more unique. It was a bit cliche in that sense.Overall I would actually suggest this movie to any horror fan; especially if you enjoy gore. It felt like a blend of the movies Wizard if Gore, IT and the Saw series combined. Give it a watch.**If your a horror person you probably won't jump at all. Just watch in enjoyment. Teens might actually get scared..."
" Terrifier is terrifying
",-0.5719,0.6064,2019-07-01 00:00:00,10,"For a slasher/serial killer movie this is by far the most brutal of a movie by far, it feels like it belongs in the 80's other that the gore but The movie does sometimes go over the top with the carnage candy gore. but isn't that what people (like me) want go out to see. It delivers everything you want from a slasher movie, but if you don't like over the top gore, this isn't the movie for you."
" Above average shock flick, but not much to write home about
",-0.2023,-0.9181,2019-07-01 00:00:00,5,"The movie seemed to have something of a reputation so I gave it a try, and while it wasn't a BAD shock movie, it missed a lot of what makes a really GREAT shock movie. The practical gore effects are SUPERB, but sadly there's not much else going on outside of that. None of the characters are grounded with any kind of back story, or even, well, story. The clown exists solely to be a brutal killer, and the victims are just cookie cutter slasher victims with no grounding to make you care about them outside of simply being basic human beings.It not particularly scary or shocking, although there are scenes that are clearly intended to be so.Its a decent shocker flick with some amazing practical gore effects, but it really didn't do anything with it's characters, and so nothing makes any sense narratively, and there's no impact to the kill scenes."
" Pretty good
",0.7269,-0.8061,2019-06-27 00:00:00,6,I have to say this was a pretty good clown horror as far as they go. The clown is pretty scary looking and quirky in his ways. Not the best horror movie ever but if your looking for a decent clown horror to watch with the lights off and some pizza this will sort you right out! Solid acting.

" More Art the Clown? Please! The movies could be better, though
",0.6696,0.9229,2019-06-16 00:00:00,8,"Art the Clown is the best thing about this movie.I thought Terrifier started out really interesting--the pizza shop scene seemed like it was done exceptionally well to me. I think the high points of the film are the initial encounters with Art--the characters being creeped out/confused by him have to be my favorite parts of the film. Where Terrifier falls apart for me is when the film transitions into the dilapidated building for the rest of the film. I feel it drags in a lot of areas and I could do without some of the cliches. I would like more variety in settings, more victims, and better acting, but considering the budget of the film, I can forgive a lot of its shortcomings. I also don't get the ending. It goes from realistic to supernatural? I'm not sure if I like that direction. My only critique of Art's appearance would be replacing the nylon on the forehead with something less see-through like rubber.Anyone who watches Terrifier not expecting a low-budget, B horror film are going to be disappointed."

" Just a fun slasher for horror fans, and a heart stopper for the coulrophobic.
",-0.1027,0.8876,2019-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Ascetically pleasing (in a horrifying way) and coupled with a voice of silence, Art the Clown is an awesome character in a fun slasher. Art's origins are unknown, and as any decent amateur filmmaker will attest to, the unknown is a tried and true element of effective storytelling.Aside from the film's main antagonist, the rest of the characters, along with the majority of the dialogue is largely unimaginative and cliche.One of the more interesting minor characters is a woman with a ""baby"" named Emily, solid performance from her.Some of the more grotesque scenes of the film will make the squeamish cringe, but the more veteran of horror fans may find the scenes hardly original, but fun nonetheless, however there was one particular unexpected method for a kill in this movie that gave me a SPLITTING headache. (thank you, I'll be here all night) If you haven't watched this movie yet, then you'll know what I mean when it happens.All in all, Terrifier is a fun 1 hr. and 24 minutes, I recommend this to any fan of a slasher, and especially to the coulrophobic."
" Terrifier: Brutal but generic
",-0.3716,0.6064,2019-05-18 00:00:00,5,"Art the Clown started back in 2011 with a short movie by the same name, truth be told I didn't like it. The creator Damien Leone would keep Art around in his feature film All Hallows' Eve (2013) but as a small role.Now here we are and Art has his own movie, but is it any good? Honestly, not really but it's better than his last solo outing.It follows the standard slasher formula and sees a couple of girls on Halloween night come under attack from a psychotic clown.So again this is generic stuff, it embraces all the usual tropes and though not predictable certainly has no surprises. It's also pretty ugly and oddly paced throughout.What Terrifier does have however is sheer unadulterated brutality. This is gory nasty no holds barred merciless stuff, I was quite shocked actually. Considering the budget they make all of it look really good, so kudos to the sfx department.I love clowns as antagonists but Art doesn't seem to tick enough boxes for me. He's less of a clown and more of a mime and doesn't seem to be an interesting enough character to carry his own film.Passable stuff but by this time next week I'll have forgotten it.The Good:Impressively grisly visualsJenna KanellUnpredictableThe Bad:Doesn't exactly flowPoor cinematography"

",-0.1531,-0.9216,2019-04-30 00:00:00,7,"Pro's and contra's on my side for this flick. If you watch this being a teen you will turn it off for so many reasons. If you are an old school geek like me then this offers a lot.Starting this ultra gore one you will notice the color grading, a pure throwback to the heydays of the slashers. And once the opening credits are shown you will get it, this is going to be an ode to the slashers and seventies horrors.Let that be the reason why teens will turn it off. Not used to see straight in your face horrors full of on-camera effects without the use of CGI. Is it all good, sadly it isn't. Some scene's are too long and there isn't really any suspense. Once the clown comes in you know what is coming, gore. Some reactions are strange or victims doing really stupid things that's what lowers my rating.For lovers of seventies, eighties horror pick it up. Gorehounds can pick it up too, it's full of red stuff and torture that some will be disgusted.Nice try this flick, and it was really a time ago that I've seen a horror with gore and effects like this."

Has a B movie kinda vibe to it but it works well. Some genuinely creepy and really f'cked up moments that make Hostel look childlike.Overall I actually really liked it. Much better than the first in my opinion. Give it a go, because there aren't many decent horrors made nowadays.Solid 8/10"

" Throwback to old Slashers, But infuriating to watch
",-0.6808,-0.9807,2019-04-24 00:00:00,2,"I'm a fan of the old schlocky B grade horror films, The video nasties come to mind. And this one looked promising to say the least. However it suffers from one of the most common pitfalls of modern movie making, infuriating the audience.There's no plot to the film, that's ok really for this kind of movie. It's the kind of guilty pleasure we get at the cheesy low budget slasher that exploits with the gore. That part it gets rather right. Where it goes horribly wrong is where too much is demanded of the audience for the indulgences of Damien Leone [the director of the film.Basically the flow of events are incredibly trite with every cliche of slash movie characters displaying mind numbing stupidity all for the advantage of the killer clown. The characters actions invite frustration rather than sympathy. This brings a horrible predictability to the film and were just waiting for the end credits to roll.David Howard Thornton does an excellent job as the demented clown. He brings a surreal quality to his roll, and it's easy to see why he was cast as the Joker before. His entire performance is dumbshow as he doesn't have a single line of dialogue. Still, with no fault to Thornton, his menace was wasted as his cat and mouse stalking followed by his kills were a tedious slog rather than tension. With the forced stupidity of his victims, we end up being angrier at the victims rather than the clown himself.Everything is just so pointless in the film. I ended up rolling my eyes in frustration than feel any fear or fun... It could have been a fun old grindhouse type slasher, But instead we get a tedious slog to go through."

Although the violence is very good, I can say the script is a little cliché. There were also logic errors that we were familiar with from bad horror movies. The main character, the Clown, is very good. In short, violence, blood and visually satisfied me, but the script part could be better.⭐ 100/52"
" Terrifyingly Ridiculous

Don't get me wrong, I was terrified. I was terrified to realize that someone had actually sat down and made this movie. Please, everyone, don't let this become a cult classic. It's not even worthy of that title! No character is memorable besides the clown. Every horror movie stereotype is shoved into this film with nauseating fervor. One character's name is even credited as ""Cat Lady"". The directing is college entry level and the acting is high school level. Never ask a noob to act drunk. You might as well actually get them drunk or you're in for some horrific fake drunk acting. The filming is boring and the editing is choppy and makes it difficult for us to know where we are. On a brighter note, the costumes are not completely awful and Art's clown makeup is genuinely eerie. The music does not stand out as bad and they have fun with a little circus music here and there. People comment that the gore is great, but that's misleading. There is a lot of gore. That does not mean it is great gore. This movie definitely went for quantity over quality. Did I mention the script is painfully terrible? Well, it is! There is no character development, characters make stereotypical, idiotic choices, and there is so much padding that if you fell off a fifty story building and landed on this film, you'd feel like you just landed on a big fluffy cloud with a million cute bunnies cuddle up next to you. I personally feel that this movie deserves one star. Yet, these people have made a movie. I have not. And, there are some good moments in this movie. If you do watch it, watch it to laugh like I did, but don't come back here and lie to everyone saying that it's a good movie. It's just not a good movie. If you're looking for a genuinely good movie or even just a decent movie, don't waste your time watching this one."
" At least I was entertained I guess

It was entertaining in that aspect, because there was lots of gore, and Art the clown was extremely creepy. However, every single thing that the actors did was the opposite of what normal people would have done.
This entire thing could have been avoided if they just called the freaking cops after seeing the clown for the second time. I mean, that's when I would've called the cops. ESPECIALLY once they realized their tires were slashed to bits. I would've called 911 SOOOOO quick, let me tell you. Even if they thought that would be embarrassing, better safe and stupid-looking than sorry. It's just frustrating to think that the entirety of this movie was based around one really dumb, small decision made by a couple of dumb girls. Sure, they were, ""drunk"" (poor acting too, btw), but people JUST DON'T act like this. Additionally, since all of the characters were unbelievably stupid, I did not feel bad for them one bit when they all died. They had no character traits or personality aside from just being hot girls who would add to the body count of the movie."

I feel compelled and obligated to warn everyone how incredibly bad this movie is. Decent start. Keeps you interested. But once the clown starts killing, it's horrendous. Some of the worst acting I've ever seen, incredibly dumb protagonists, even terrible special effects with the violence. You'd thing that a movie made in 2016 would have better blood effects than a film from the 70's or 80's but no. It's right on par with movies made 40 or 50 years with its special effects. Maybe this is why the director found it necessary to over-saturate the entire film. Red's, blue's, yellow's. All of them way too sharp. Makes it look like a movie made by gore crazed teenagers. Pointless watch. Avoid it at all costs."

The performance of the clown-murderer is obviously the best part of the film, amusing the viewer with creepy glares and hilarious body language.

",-0.3824,-0.9975,2019-03-17 00:00:00,5,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I think it's a good horror movie but it's not a movie that I can say I enjoyed. Or one that I would watch again. It's a slasher with gory scenes that will shock, disturb, and possibly even traumatize you. I consider myself to have a strong stomach when it comes to gore and among the many horror flicks I've seen, there's not much gore that bothers me. This movie had a scene that was so bad I had to look away...also, you can never relax while watching this movie. The killer clown is so mad and unpredictable that it will make you tense up in anticipation of what new messed up thing he will pull next.One thing I did enjoy about this movie was the dark humor. The killer clown is messed up, but there are some things he does that are just so bizarre that you can't help but laugh. The guy that played the role does an excellent job at striking the right balance between creepy and funny.Overall, it's not my favorite kind of horror. I didn't exactly like the movie because it disturbed me in all the wrong ways (unlike, say, Sinister or The Descent). But if you like gory splatter-fests and want to traumatize yourself, then go for it."

" MUCH better than expected. Nice little blood-filled, creepy clown flick.
",0.6908,0.9853,2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,"There are plenty of synopses about this film, so there is no need to rehash storyline here other than to mention that it was far better and more enjoyable than expected. Not only was Terrifier well written but the overall production was a pleasant surprise, from the decent (though not exceptional) acting, to the special fx, editing, and cinematography. Nothing is what would be considered top notch or award winning, but everything was at the very least average, and in some cases good. In the case of David Howard Thornton (who plays the clown), he was darn near superb. Overall the film is an enjoyable watch, brining some new twists to an overused concept. Having some decent (though not excessive) blood and gore was a treat as well, since so many killer clown movies stop short of actual carnage and terror.Having read through all the reviews, I am surprised at the low ratings from a handful of reviewers. Though, upon watching the film and rereading these reviews it is evident that the reviewers had one or more of the following issues:
went in to the film with different expectations for what they would view, most notably from reading reviews that claim it is too gory or not gory enough. People tend to forget that these are very subjective terms, and what one person finds exceptionally gory might be tame to another,made some false comparisons to other films; doing so is always a mistake unless there are connected elements between the films. Most notably, there are a few reviews that specifically mention 'It' or 'Clown,' and while some critics' reviews made these comparisons, viewers were obviously not able to view Terrifier without carrying in the preconceived ideas of what it should/would be,lots of complaints that the story offered nothing new and followed similar formulas to other killer clown movies.With regards to the first two, it's always a bummer when a decent, enjoyable movie is panned because of a viewer's preconceived notions and already-established expectations. There is some truth to the story being a bit formulaic, but that shouldn't mean it can't be enjoyable. The plot & story are different enough that it hasn't been told a million times over, even if it's a bit formulaic. Viewers watching this for the first time can be aware of this, but for crying out loud...don't judge Terrifier on the merits or content of other films. Watch it for what it is, and enjoy it."

I don't understand how this has any positive reviews because the acting is garbage supreme, the dialogue is brainless, & the film is an hour and a half of unnecessary torture porn for wannabe future serial killers to watch in mom's basement. If you want to see an unfrightening, predictable clown continuously win against innocent people (mostly women) in disgusting fashion, then look no further. Horror films like this are detrimental to my favorite genre; contributing nothing new, while poisoning people's minds."
" Embarassing for all involved
",0.0,-0.6542,2019-02-13 00:00:00,1,"Watching Terrifier, after all of the hype, was an embarassing experience. Horror fans really need to have higher standards if this is what's hitting their spot; like a nice well intentioned girl you see in a relationship with an abusive sadistic scumbag with an IQ akin to that of pencil shavings.Terrifier is not a film. There is no plot and you could find a better cast in a summer camp production of Grease. The lines of dialogue from its generic characters are delivered with no effort making the whole film feel like a lazy aimless excuse to watch people tortured by a clown.From what I've gathered, this director has been trying to make this Art the Clown happen for years, through various shorts and anthology films. Well some words of advice: if as a filmmaker all you have in your deck is a mute clown with scary face paint and a twisted smile who butchers up one dimensional non-actors, (really, they might as well be mannequins), you should stop making films. This director clearly has no inspiration, and is trying to carve a career for himself off of one half baked idea, poorly executed. Maybe he should be a costume or makeup FX designer, but if this is the future of horror, I hope Art the Clown hammers a knife through my skull ASAP."

" Gory fun

When the interview is over, someone attacks the interviewer.Then two girls leave a Halloween party, go for some pizza. At the pizza joint they meet Art the clown. He's just sitting there giving everyone a hard time. Eventually the boss kicks him out. After the girls leave we learn that Art killed the boss and his employee gruesomely. One of the girls needs a restroom so she asks some guy she sees in front of a building to let her in. He agrees. He's about to fumigate the building. There's some crazy lady in the building...and Art. Soon the girl runs into her friend as Art is cutting her apart, literally. At some point the girl called her sister to pick them up, she eventually also ends up in the building being chased by Art. When the cops arrive, there's a surprise turn of events, and a not so surprising surprise at the morgue. There's a final revelatory scene.Terrifier is a lower budget horror movie where all the money went into the brutal gore and there's plenty of gore, more than in any recent horror movie. Art (and Leone) sure has something against faces as he loves destroying them. Usually I don't care for clowns, in horror or elsewhere, but Art is a genuinely creepy and disturbing looking clown, much more effective than the downright stupid looking clown in the new It. The dialogue, the little there is, is pretty good and natural. And overall the story is pretty good and shows some effort. I could have done though without a near-naked Art.Unfortunately there's a lot that is necessarily formulaic in Terrifier. The whole thing takes place at night of course. The location is awful. It's supposed to be an empty building with an abandoned auto repair shop or some such thing and most of the action takes place in the basement. Once the action starts, dialogue stops. There are few sound and no music. Art is also silent, even when he's being attacked and getting hurt. When you have no dialogue things also get boring quickly, and even though this movie is shorter it does feel longer, even more so since Art isn't exactly a quick-moving fellow.I sure look forward to a sequel. One can only imagine what Leone could do with a bigger budget. Overall, Terrifier is a recommended horror flick."

" Aptly named
",0.0,-0.9974,2019-01-15 00:00:00,3,I didn't want to watch this one so I just ignored it every time I did a search of horror films. I have been trying to find a truly terrifying horror film for a long time now and haven't had much luck. Finally I decided to give this one a go as I was getting desperate for something to watch. I'm not gonna laugh this one off and say it was stupid etc...like I usually do after I see a horror film that is rumored to be truly horrifying. For me truly terrifying movies are ones that deal in some type of reality. Most of the horror films out there deal with ghosts and supernatural stuff I don't believe in and the likelihood of those things happening are slim to none. What makes me truly scared is stuff like this. Granted this was torture porn BUT this kind of stuff has happened and does happen. There are sick people out there who torture and kill people. The fact that those people walk among us is what keeps me up at night. I am one step away from never leaving my house in general due to all of my fears and neuroses (irrational or not) so to see something like this just confirms some of my deepest fears.The Terrifier is an actual person (well until the end when they make it supernatural) not a ghost or anything like that and is killing for no other reason than because they are mentally disturbed. I think the most terrifying scene was the one with him and the fake baby. You see this moment where he seems to be softening only to see him wearing the skin of the woman the baby belonged to in the next scene. He has no feelings and no remorse. When someone is truly unstable like that it is really scary because there is no appealing to them or their human side.The pizza scene was truly horrifying as well. If someone came into an establishment I was eating in and sat there and looked at me like that clown did to Tara I would get the heck out of there so fast I wouldn't even bother paying for my food. I'd call 911 and deal with the restaurant later.The scene where the clown is naked except for the skin of that one homeless woman was disturbing as well. The creepiness of his movements was just something you can't unsee.I know most of the reviews state that this is dumb and blah blah and I do agree that this was stupid and the acting was atrocious BUT the overall idea is truly terrifying because realistically it could happen. The movie shows a scenario that seems unlikely and most likely probably is BUT it is not out of the realm for it to be realistic if the clown were to kidnap one person and torture them to death.I do not think that movies like this should exist. I don't really know what purpose they serve. I think that if someone is already a little mentally unstable and sees this type of movie it might give them ideas. The world is already a scary violent place. I don't think we need to go searching for more things to add to that in our free time. I DO like scary movies BUT this is just unnecessary. I really don't know what the point is.I do give credit to the actor who played Art the Clown. He was super creepy and made this terrifying but I can't say I would recommend that anyone watch this. Once you see things like this you can't unsee them and they stay with you. I think it's better to focus on things that won't keep you up at night or more afraid to leave your house.
" A fantastic homage to the slasher genre
",0.5574,0.9669,2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"It seems every bad review, and even a few good ones, is looking at this movie without context. What I got out of it was an incredibly passionate love letter to the Slasher flicks of old. Like those films, it lacks in plot, logical characters, honestly the villain makes stupid decisions as well. And I can definitely see why people would be frustrated watching the characters run about like aimless turkeys with absolutely no common sense. However, when you put it into the context of being a tribute (as I am entirely certain it was meant to be), you get a brilliant movie that really does justice to the genre. It's campy and fun with plenty of gore. It's self-aware and still manages to be creative and pretty darn scary at times.I would say, go into this expecting an entertaining gore-fest, but if you're looking for something with intelligent characters and plot, there are plenty of other things being made that would be more to your liking right now."
" Something Wicked-er's overview of Terrifier 2017
",0.0,0.9057,2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,"Since the day I saw Terrifier's antagonist the Creepy Sadistic Art the Clown in his previous outing the Anthology 'All Hallows Eve' 6 years ago, being the scariest Horror Movie Clown I had ever witnessed, I knew he would be perfect for a full length outing so when I heard that's what director Damien Leone had planned for us I was one very excited Gore-Geek and knew Art would find his rightful place amongst the greatest of Horror icons and I've never been so right. Art played expertly with passion and relish by new comer David Howard Thornton is as hardcore and unstoppable as Haddenfield ghoul Michael Myers and has a wicked sense of humour that would make Freddy take notes, he's a mysterious entity with Supernatural abilities hinted at but wisely left for the inevitable sequels to fully explore. Art never says one word for the features duration which is a factor that definitely benefits the character relying on demented expressions, twisted body language and his signature silent mocking laugh. He is unnerving unpredictable vicious and remorseless with his trusty dustbin bag proudly swung over his shoulder full to the brim with a versatile set of both conventional weapons and hand crafted torture devises that could cause John Kramer to turn green with envy and with these and any item he grabs along the way he creates some of the most elaborate and gruesomely depraved murder set pieces seen since Ryan Nicholson's 'Gutterballs'. The effects are all practical and look absolutely fantastic and are as realistic as the highest budgeted torture porn outing that you could imagine. Terrifier has a tone all of its own but in some ways has a dark feel and look similar to scummy 80's city slashers such as 'Maniac' and 'Driller Killer'. The 80's Slasher Throwback appeal is most definitely rife in this Flick but it doesn't feel or look dated in the slightest infact the picture is extremely crisp and beautiful to behold with a very suitable cool ambient Synthwave sound track that feels exciting while giving a real sense of dread as well as some very bizarre non sync jazz horn music which Art seems to enjoy immensely as he does literally slicing people apart and boy we get to see a lot of that! As Mike the exterminator (the closest we get to a hero) played by Matt McAllister states he is ""A total Fu*king Maniac"" and even that's an understatement! The camera never shys away from the most disturbing of deaths and there is one without a doubt that would have been declared a notorious banned video nasty probably never to be decriminalised had it been released back in the day, I won't ruin it for you but you'll know instantly what I mean when you witness it! Guaranteed you won't forget it for a long long time to come - yes it is that extreme, take the nastiest scene in 'Bone Tomahawk' and multiple it by 10 and you might be somewhere close! The tagline from Tobe Hopper's notorious 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' springs to mind considering this movie ""Who Will Survive & What Will Be Left of Them"" but rather than the marketing ploy that was, you can take those words literally with 'Terrifier' as absolutely every protagonist is fair game and everybody loses body parts along the way. This is a fully accomplished Horror film that balances the scary creep factor and unbelievable hardcore gore perfectly, bravo to all involved."

" Gore galore, but hard to sit through
",-0.1531,-0.9879,2018-12-13 00:00:00,5,"I admit going in to this film with a trying to like it mindset, I have to say I believe some of the films downside is to be blamed on budgetary restrictions, which is why I am rating this a bit higher than I would a larger studio production churning this grade of cinema out, not to mention some of the people behind this film are pretty stellar individuals, but that said, this isn't a film I would recommend to audiences look to feel scared.But let's start with the obvious, Art the clown itself, is terrifying, creepy and grotesque, he is truly a well crafted killing icon, who unfortunately just does not receive the calibre of film he truly deserves with this one.The plot is quite simple, which is not a flaw for this genre of film, deranged clown on a psychotic and gruesome killing spree, on Halloween night, which means people in costumes, and a whole lot of capability to get away with, murder, literally. The film has an interesting start that I did not expect, unfortunately it is upon pressing play immediately that you have to decide if you're willing to stick with the film as its budget shows immediately, and the actress in the opening scene, needs more time to hone her chops before taking on another opening kill type of role.Now for the male horror fans, there is some decent nudity if that is what draws you to the film, albeit with a sinister sensibility, and the gore for the most part is top notch, well done especially for its lower budget, but unfortunately it is the acting which truly drags the film itself down, with the exception of the actress playing Tara, the presumed lead of the filmDawn does good during the films most truly horrific sequence which I did find hard to sit through, which I give them props for, very ballsy scene, impressive. The film makes its biggest backstep when it attempts to throw a plot twist at us and kills off the only character with enough acting prowess to cause us to care for her wellbeing, Tara, to refocus the rest of the story on meaningless muder and the sister who is not wholly bad in her role, just isn't strong enough to have us worry for her, and in this kind of film that's quasi problematic.The film itself has decent audio, score and there were a few moments of tension through out, however it does not leave you in the edge of your seat but after killing off Tara, any of those kind of sequences are thrown to the wind, simply because we truly don't care about what happens after that, at least not nearly as much as we tried to care before it.I watched this film two times to see if maybe it was just my mood the first viewing, or if maybe it was just the plot itself. I was in a good mood the second viewing, so you do the math. I must say I really really wanted to love this film, I pushed myself to enjoy it but at the end of it all, it was just subpar, which again I must admit I think has a hell of a lot to do with its budget.A higher budget could have afforded higher calibre cast and crew as well as possibly someone to say hey, we don't have a strong enough second lead to kill off the first one, let's maybe not do that.I rated this a five despite the negatives because to me it was different, not a remake and an indie feature which I think all horror fans should try to be more supportive of otherwise all we will ever see are remakes and sequels to the same tired franchises which ultimately disappoint us.Most of the movies I've reviewed have been below five, so this does not fall into the worst films I've seen this year category, but even with me understanding it's budget, and sympathizing with that, it is nowhere near the top films either and falls slightly to the middle, forgettable unless gore is the only thing you need to entertain you, because then you may love this film, because it does its gore well, and has plenty of it.Please do not hate me.

" Simple and effective
",0.4767,0.6202,2018-12-06 00:00:00,9,"If you're a fan of the Friday the 13th series you'll like this. The plot is bare bones, but it shines because of it. This is no psychological thriller. A silent killer stalks his victims and picks them off in various ways. The gore is present but not over the top (for horror) and the cinematography surprises you by setting up cliche shots only to surprise you with the unexpected. The actor playing the killer does a great job at being creepy, terrifying, and even humorous at times. The rest of the cast are pretty convincing for the most part (minus one or two characters), but they're small roles. I'm definitely coming back to this one."
" A missed opportunity
",0.1531,-0.9244,2018-12-03 00:00:00,2,"One of the taglines on the cover art for Terrifier reads ""Makes Pennywise look like Krusty the Clown."" While Terrifier certainly offers more blood and gore than both the 1990 and 2017 adaptations of Stephen King's IT, there is very little ""Terror"" to be experienced. Pennywise is a full-bodied character, psychologically torturing children before he devours them. Art the Clown has no back story, no depth and no motive to kill other than the apparent benefit of the audience. One of the biggest problems with Terrifier, regardless of the creepy aesthetic of Art the Clown, is that it's plot less. The various killings are used as mechanisms to stitch a film together and while the deaths themselves are nasty in concept they leave much to be desired in execution...excuse the pun. The blood and gore is overdone and executed with hokey glee. This would be fine if Terrifier was meant to be a horror comedy or spoof (see Brain Dead, Housebound) but it isn't. The acting leaves a lot to be desired for the most part and one barely has a chance to connect with any characters before they are offed. Add to all of this pointless would-be horror a silly final sequence and you have Terrifier, a missed opportunity that could have been truly disturbing and vicious if developed properly."

Very rarely do you see a truly original kill scene such as in this and it will either turn your stomach or make you cheer on the brutality. It isn't terribly predictable in the sense that there isn't a known protagonist which is such a staple in slasher films. It bends some of the rules, changes things up. The villain, Art the Clown, is scary in his own way - mainly he's truly a maniac, lacking humanity and emotion, only finding enjoyment in torturing his victims psychologically and physically. This ended up being a hidden gem for gore lovers like myself. It's been a long time since I've watched a movie and immediately wanted a sequel."

His appearance lends itself to a few pretty frightening images, and his total silence extends to movement; it's unsettling to hear not even the creak of his bones or a rustling of fabric.It's also horrifically violent, heavy on facial mutilation, and I liked how the movie didn't restrict Art to any one tool, it gave him a trash bag to lug around just about anything with a sharp edge or blunt force.However these small decisions regarding Art are exceptionally lacking in the film's other aspects, which include bland actors, cheap lighting, and no grounds on its sense of place. The bulk of the movie happens in some gross, nondescript apartment/warehouse hybrid, and it just looks like total poopy. It'd be impressive for a student film, only in that it actually got made."

" Masterpiece of brutal visual horror
",-0.5719,0.9667,2018-11-08 00:00:00,9,"But, N.B., nothing more than that.""Terrifier"" is a nonsensical film where a nameless guy in a truly spooky clown costume commits a variety of atrocities. The atrocities, as well as the spookiness of the clown himself, are the purpose of the film. Two faces get wrecked in the first half hour alone. The film embraces the ethos of exploitation, specifically as developed in low budget horror films in the 1970s - 1980s, and exceeds any reasonable expectations you can have from that perspective.Incidentally, though the real draw is the frequent and copious gore, there's a bit of subtlety as well. When re-watching a couple of key sequences, I was surprised to notice how rich the sequences were beyond the immediate dismemberment. For example, in an early face-mangling sequence, there are quick cuts away to beauty products, emphasizing that this isn't just a physical injury, but also a sentimental injury for a victim who takes great pride in her physical beauty.Anyway, it's bloody and spooky and worth your time if you've watched classic gore movie and wonder why they don't make them like that anymore."
" This movie made me want to punch my own Television.
",0.0772,-0.9972,2018-11-08 00:00:00,1,"Where do I start? I guess I'll get straight to the point, this film is a steaming pile, it's a seriously strong contender for one of the worst horror films I've ever seen in my entire life. I stand by my statement when I say that nearly all of the positive reviews on this site are the cast and crew trying to promote this abortion.I watched this so you don't have to (please for the love of god don't), but I watched this for free and I still want my money and time back. The film opens with this extremely awkward attack scene where Vicky, the sole survivor of the Halloween massacre, attacks and mauls the newscaster interviewing her to death for mocking her disfigured face, and that's it, it has no relevance to the plot and it's just an excuse to throw in some more gore, and the gore effects aren't even good, this has to be some of the fakest looking blood and guts I've ever seen in a slasher, and all of the kills are accompanied by this really bad electronic music that adds no mood or atmosphere to any scenes, it's seriously one of the worst music scores I've ever heard in a horror movie.Next is the acting and characters, oh boy. I'm sure these actors are nice people in real life, and they look like they're having fun, but they really need to ask for a refund from whatever acting school they graduated from because this is some really amateurish and flat acting, not once did I ever believe that they became their characters and they even suck at looking scared. Their characters aren't any better, this is one of the worst scripts I've ever encountered for any movie, period.These stupid characters have hundreds of opportunities to kill this deranged clown but they knock him down once and they just run off, giving him plenty of time to get back up and try again, and this clown, contrary to even negative reviews praising him, is not scary in the slightest. There's only so many times you can see a deranged and bloody clown with a toothy smile to the point where you're desensitized and it's not frightening anymore.Last but not least are the production values, there's not a single set and everything appears to have been filmed on location, which is okay I guess but everything else is an inexcusable fault. The lighting is incredibly over saturated to the point where some scenes looked too bright or the actor's faces looked like they were smeared in Vaseline, it's really that bad, and that's not even mentioning the extremely bland and basic cinematography. Every single shot is flat and uninteresting, there's no memorable scenes or shots to remain in your nightmares.So yeah, this film is painful to endure and absolutely clueless on how to create horror. It can't even be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure because the gore is so cheap and fake looking (newsflash: buckets of fake Walmart blood doesn't constitute as horror) and it's not bad enough to be good. I give it an F."

A lot of what makes this one work so well is based around the central clown who is one of the more impressive figures in the genre. The concept of the silent, emotionless style of clown make-up as well as the design of the creature itself is quite terrifying by itself, but to add it together to the mime-like antics and sinister looks he continually gives off while stalking really helps to make for quite a creepy persona. That is added onto the other scenes here where he simply spots them out on the streets or toys with them in the various buildings around the warehouse which are exceptionally creepy and chilling. That there's plenty of fun, brutal kills that pop up as a result of his demented attitude provides the main part of the fun here, featuring the stalking to get these scenes set up from the initial encounter with the clown at the restaurant that goes back to show him slaughtering the staff later on, the first encounters at the abandoned building where it all takes place with the stalking in the basement or the various floors of the building taking out the random interlopers that appear along the way and leading into the two major centerpieces that show up. The scene of the character hanging upside down and the eventual outcome is unquestionably the highlight of the film, and along with the final battle in the underground with it there's plenty to like about this which is all about the inadvertent luring of the other sister and then detailing their wholesale struggle to get away knowing full-well what's happening around them. From meeting up with the skinned yet still alive victim, getting beaten down continuously by the deranged clown and then seeing the final resolution that really holds up nicely as well, there's some fun to be had with the big finish to this one and really helps to hold this one up over it's few minor flaws. The main factor here is the fact that there's not much in the story at all here, going from person to person as they randomly happen upon the killer through sheer circumstance that the film really doesn't have any real point at all throughout here. The swerve in the different characters surviving doesn't even give this a plot as to where this one centers simply on showcasing one big gore-gag after a while which is where the film really stumbles. That just ends up making the film feel pointless and repetitive, rendering a lot of the killer's appearances into a bland series of scenes that's simply there to kill someone graphically and leaves this one on the whole rather redundant. This might not be as big a flaw as it really is since that might put off others more than some really do, and is the biggest factor to hold this back.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity."

People go into horror movies expecting a script with possibility of being an Oscar contender. Those people really need to watch a different genre...I don't even bother listening to their reviews because they obviously don't understand that slashers aren't supposed to be watched for their script; they are meant for blood, gore, kills; you get the gist.
Now, as for my review, I loved this movie. You get all the above with pure brutality. Most horror movies lately dumb down the violence, blood, and gore to appeal to all audiences. If I watch a horror/slasher movie, I want to see that in all its glory and this delivered! It was refreshing seeing a filmmaker go back to the roots of 70's and 80's horror films.
I'm one who loves practical effects in horror films and an excellent job was done in that department. The acting was good, better than some slashers. We're bad decisions made by the characters as others have claimed? Of course, but what kind of horror movie would it be if the characters made smart choices?! You can't go into a movie like this and pick it apart. The movie would only be 15 minutes if the characters made decisions like they were in the real world! Critiquing a horror movie based on character decisions is taking a movie like this way too seriously. Maybe these people need to watch a different type of film.
I would like to give extra credit to David Howard Thorton who played Art the Clown. His portrayal of a sadistic clown was amazing. Seriously, he was really creepy. I don't give spoilers, but I'll hint at one particular scene when a character was hiding in a metal cabinet. When you see it, you'll understand. All I'll say is he must be a fan of Buffalo Bill. This says a little, but you can't fully understand the creepiness of it until you see it. Mr. Thorton deserves most of the credit for making this movie stand out. But as I said before the acting was good for this type of movie.
I highly recommend that fans of slasher films watch this movie. Please don't go into this movie to pick apart every flaw like it's supposed to be an award winning film. Unless, of course, it's a contender for a Fangoria Chainsaw award. Watch it for what it is; a superb, hold back nothing, horror film. One of the goriest movies I've seen in a long time. Sure, I've seen gorier, but this is definately up there with the goriest films. Definately a must-see for fans of the genre. If you don't like slasher movies, blood, gore, violence, then don't see it just to give it a bad review. Fans only please."

In many, many parts of the film, you can see the actor who plays the killer's skin. Youcan see his plainwhite neck skin as he sits in the diner, you get a shot up his sleeve a bit later. Those are total immersion breaking shots. They ruin any ideas you could come up with about the origin of this killer. It cheapens, an already cheap plot twist. All the money and time spent on special effects and they couldn't either makeup his skin that showed, or stopped it from showing. Just an aweful movie.

" Stop asking for a plot. This is a SLASHER HORROR
",-0.7672,-0.9803,2018-10-23 00:00:00,8,"I've never understood why people demand a thorough plot to be executed in a slasher horror film. The point of the movie is not to introduce and establish characters and personalities beyond a superficial level. To do so would mean to sacrifice the terror and tension itself which usually eats up the latter 2/3 of a movie... OR else you'd be watching a three hour+ movie which is not most peoples cup of tea. Also, when a maniac killer crosses the paths of his victims, he does it suddenly and without warning. He doesn't stop to elaborate on the why he is doing it. He just does it. There is no story or explanation why. This is what makes a horror realistic, grisly and what makes a horror movie acceptable. This is one of the few slasher movies I've ever seen where I actually liked one or two of the protagonists. They don't act like cliche idiots. Most of the time after turning on a slasher film, the first words out of my mouth are ""well I personally wouldn't care if they get killed anyways"" because the main characters are a mockery of any reasonably intelligent person. You can already tell they're going to get themselves killed ASAP. To be fair, there WERE some royal blunders made by the main characters later in the movie but by that point you've already decided whether you like them or not.

",0.0,0.9017,2018-10-19 00:00:00,1,"I hopped right onto the bandwagon with this movie. It appeared on quite a few lists for underrated horror movies and Netflix gems.
You start being introduced to a very terribly deformed woman and by terribly i mean her face looks like party city had an after Halloween discount sale, boohoo sob story, murder.. jump to the main characters, your dark and brooding seemingly intelligent protagonist Tara and her ditsy blonde bimbo side piece Dawn. I can tell you Dawns death was the highlight of my night. The acting is...terrible lets just be honest i have seen better acting in high school short films on YouTube where they ask their parents to play along.
I cant begin to tell you how horrible some of these lines are in the movie.... humor me and picture this. woman's face has been shot repeatedly her bereaved sister collapses at her side. insert crying...wake up....no....then they hit you with the Oscar winning line.....""look at me"" LOOK AT ME! SHE DOESN'T HAVE A FACE ANYMORE!! Who wrote this! Its like asking a blind man to walk across the freeway its not gonna happen...
Art the clown is definitely a creepy character and I will say there is one great scene with him that involves wearing someone else body parts but other than that...imagine a clown running around killing people and you have the entire movie congrats.
If you want to have a good laugh at a corny slasher this is the movie for you. If your trying to sleep with the lights on....look else where."
" Thy Art is Murder
",-0.6908,-0.7717,2018-10-14 00:00:00,7,"A thrilling amalgamation of old school slasher tropes and modern day torture porn. The grindhouse aesthetic is meticulously crafted and the set in particular leaves a pervading feeling of unease down every hallway. The story is serviceable and whilst the second half does tread the line between just sticking with traditions and protagonists making questionably stupid contextual decisions, the main cast is well acted. However it's the antagonist himself, Art the Clown, that steals the show and cements his place as a believably sadistic clown and more than just the emo Charlie Chaplin he initially appears as. A great watch if you're into janked up antagonists and the games they play."

However, my morbid curiosity already piqued, I wanted to see what ""all the fuss was about"".

Being that this terminology has been thrown around loosely for years. This film does no favors for a dying genre. I fail to see where any deeper meaning is being inferred or implied here. Saying that the plot line is shallow is putting it lightly, as the plot is non-existent here. Garish effects, not even B movie grade acting, and yet some how, simultaneously dull throughout.

I would say The Terrifier definitely has terrible acting, tons of plot holes, and little to no character development. But you have to ask yourself, is it really necessary? Do you really have to expect some deep back story about why the clown does what he does? Without giving too much away. I am an avid horror film guy. The gore is a 7/10 for me. The clown is a 7/10. The acting, story, and characters get a 1/10. Overall it was creepy. I would describe it as the movie ""It"" meets ""Texas Chainsaw"" with a little bit of Ed Gein (inspiration for Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs as well as Leather face). Its creepy, comical at times, and if you are bored and aren't squeamish when it comes to some gore, its fun to watch."

So do most of the slashers we love and cherish. I'm of the opinion that a lot of the negative reviews are either from A. People who'd rather see another Saw sequel or B. Wannabe filmmakers who haven't managed to make anything themselves and probably never will. This is a super gory, glorious piece of low budget horror with a genuinely creepy killer. There are also some surprises you won't see coming, one in particular that really threw me. Don't listen to the negheads and see it for yourself. I am in no way involved with the making of this film."
" That is one FREAKY clown!
",-0.5461,-0.995,2018-10-07 00:00:00,4,"This movie has some true horror filled moments with some of the most gruesome murders I've sent. The special effects are really good and (mostly) believable. It seems gore movie makers are always trying to raise the bar higher. 
I think this movie would be great for teenagers that want to be scared. The director has done a great job at building tension in a lot of moments. And Art the clown, played by David Howard Thornton is fantastic. His prior experience with mime has really given the psycho clown a freaky, unsettling edge. There are a few moments that are disturbing to watch but I think there are a few people out there that would enjoy the movie for that reason. 
There are a few reasons that this movie didn't do it for me.
Spoilers below:
What is the logistical possibility of sawing a girl in half longways with a rusty old hacksaw. The scene in question took about 30 secs but really, I think it would've taken someone a lot longer. Regardless of how strong a person is, or how sharp the saw is, there are a lot of bones and tendons to try to get through. Maybe I'm being picky, but when these thoughts are going through my head, it reflects on the movie's ability to keep you engaged. 
I don't know about most people but I like my horror movies to have some kind of story. This movie does not. There were a bunch of contrivances that allowed more people to come into the scope of the film, and then get killed. The body count for the film is almost total. I think that when you watch the credits, there are more dead cast members than survivors. I watched this movie without watching the Terrifier (2011) short, or All Hallow's Eve 2013 so I'm not sure if there is any back story for the clown. I didn't understand why he was killing everyone, other than being mentally unbalanced. 
I liked the main girl, Tara played by Jenna Kanell. Well I thought she was the main girl. I felt a bit cheated that she died half way through the film. I'm sure the director was trying to keep you guessing, but when you get your audience to develop a relationship with your actors and then you kill said actor without a suitable replacement, they lose interest in the film. Once Tara died, I didn't really feel like watching the rest because I didn't really care about the other characters. Jenna Kanell did a great job and I feel like her acting was the stand out of the film. 
I am a horror movie fan and generally I like actors in movies to act according to the motivations of their characters. What I mean by this is that if a girl is running for her life, the actor needs to be able to show this in the film. You need to be able to believe that that actor actually fears for their life. When an actor is believable and act like we all feel we would act in that situation, we keep engaged in the movie. We don't question whether it's real or not. Some of the characters had a trouble convincing me that they weren't acting. Or I just didn't understand why they did the things they did. I don't understand why the clown decided to kill people; I don't understand why the various victims didn't take the opportunity to hit / slash / stab / club the clown when he was on the ground; I don't understand why the sight of a body cut in half didn't cause Vicky to run for help at the end instead of investigating further, to name a few.
Also the ending was kind of dumb. There was no supernatural inkling until the end of the movie when the clown comes back from the dead. That moment has cause me to drop my rating by a few stars. Also the tie in to the beginning with the deformed girl killing the pretty talk show host was pointless and contributed nothing to the movie. 
Overall the movie was horrifying in places and plenty of scenes that will stay in my mind. Quite visually disturbing, but in a good way."

" Gory fun
",0.5106,-0.9978,2018-10-01 00:00:00,7,"So I watched the new horror film Terrifier on Netflix. I wasn't really expecting much, but I must say I really enjoyed it for what it was. The plot of the movie is incredibly simple. A killer clown is on the loose to murder people in a vicious and gory spectacle of blood and guts. That's pretty much the entire movie. It's not exactly the most complex of films, but it still makes for an entertaining blood-soaked slasher. I will say that there were a couple overused horror cliches peppered throughout the movie though. Of course it's rare to find originality in the horror genre nowadays.The central antagonist is a creepy clown that does nothing but grin and murder. His murderous antics all around made him a memorable villain. I could easily see this film spawning a few sequels. If you are looking for a complex backstory or character motivation look elsewhere. The villain is a killer clown who murders people because he's a killer clown. What can I say, clowns are creepy.For any gore fan out there this movie certainly delivers. The violence is over-the-top and in your face. Every new character introduced is an excuse for the clown to murder them in some creepy manner. The movie wasn't exactly working with A-list actors, but I didn't find any actor to be distracting.While I did enjoy the creep factor of the antagonist and the level of gore, the movie didn't provide much suspense. I would have preferred more genuinely scary moments then the shock and all spectacle the movie provided.All around Terrifier was a surprisingly well made low budget slasher. It wasn't the smartest movie in the world and could definitely use some polishing, but it provided a creep factor and lots of blood and guts. Recommended viewing for this Halloween. A 7 out of 10."
" Art the Clown needs a better movie
",0.4404,0.9675,2018-10-01 00:00:00,5,"I'm giving this a 5 purely because I think Art the Clown is legitimately creepy. He's a great character and I even have to give props to the actor who played him. There was great physicality with him. He's got an iconic look and Im sure the character will gain some kind of cult status in the horror fanbase. If he was in a different movie with a different director, I could see this being a mainstream success. First of all, the writing is cliched. The characters are one dimensional and for the most part not likable. They make stupid decisions. And to top it off they didnt hire very good actors. I also feel there was loose threads that never got tied up. Early on (in a flash forward if you will) one of the characters says that he's dead and ""she made sure of it"". But that never pays off or comes to fruition. I dont know if they planned something else and maybe due to budget/time or studio interference that got changed. And while I dont think every killer needs some huge backstory explaining why they are what they are, it seemed like they were setting up in the beginning that he was human and then by the end, its seems they wanted to suggest that maybe he's supernatural of some kind. I wish that had maybe more explanation or felt more coherent. Production wise, it comes across as a cheaply made movie...which hey....it probably was. I think the kills were pretty decent in terms of the make-up effects. Can't say they were always at 100% ( a couple times its obvious a dummy is there) but overall decent for the kind of budget this film had. And if you like brutal kills in horror movies, this film definitely has it. Definitely does not shy away from the gore. It's not a great film in any stretch of the imagination. But I think if you're just looking for a crazy film to watch come Halloween and you dont want to think too hard....this might be up your alley."
" A Must See For Horror Fans!!!
",-0.6784,-0.943,2018-10-01 00:00:00,10,"Terrifier is one incredibly entertaining, bloody goriest horror flick that has no boundaries in a positive way and it's purely a tribute to old school 80s horror! A new face of horror is here and his name is Art The Clown played by David Howard Thornton who badly needs an Oscar for his performance. Art is the most twisted and creepiest killer clown I have ever seen and he even makes the new Pennywise look like a friendly cartoon character from the Disney channel... LOL...

Apart from Art the Clown, no other character was written well but it doesn't matter because this movie still manages to live up to the gore and jump scares you'd want out of an old 80s horror flick.

I don't mind the bad acting, actually adds to the charm of the movie (EXCEPT for the clown...damn David Howard Thornton is good!), or the low budget set (also serves the flick well), and the gore was brave...going where a lot of flicks don't have the guts to. (Literally and figuratively ;0). But not introducing the supernatural aspect 'til the second to last scene in the morgue, was too much too late. (Lights flickering post mortem) The film shows him in the beginning applying his makeup as if he's just some sick mental, ""regular"" human serial killer. Perhaps I need to watch the 2011 prequel to understand this. Also, I was left confused as if the survivor was the same lady in the first interview or if history was repeating itself. The interviewer recalls it was the ""Miles County Massacre"" but I have no idea if the story was about that particular death toll or his motivation for his next Halloween killer rampage. I re-watched the beginning, but still can't figure it out. All in all, I watched it all the way through, and in this day in age of SO many choices, and short attention spans, that counts for something."

" Best Thing About This Movie: THE CLOWN!!!
",0.7249,-0.8283,2018-09-24 00:00:00,3,"This movie had some elements with great potential but unfortunately fell short.It's sad to see a horror movie that could've been great not executed correctly. Horrible writing, bad directing, and amateur acting. The cinematography was also very amateur, I could've gotten past it if everything else was in order, but unfortunately it wasn't. It's ultimately just another cliche horror movie with characters that make dumb choices and scenes that lack logic. There are other insanely stupid factors in this movie but you will see what I mean when you watch it (If you still even want too).Personally I think the only upside was the clown. I found the clown to be rather original as far as appearance. I feel like the creators behind the clown (the actor, writer(s), and director(s)) also hit the mark with the clowns personality. I found it to be the perfect mix of comedic, psychotic, and straight up creepy which in my opinion is the perfect combo for a horror clowns personality. Too bad that he wasn't used in the proper movie though, because if so, I feel he could've been an iconic movie character. Who knows, maybe he'll inspire future horror movie clowns and contribute to a great movie to come."

More so than myself, horror fans seem to forgive a lot of things in these movies and really just care about whether or not the damned thing is actually scary -- and I have to say that, despite all its flaws, it made me uneasy when I went to bed after the viewing.You can't start reviewing this without talking about the clown. He's exceptionally uncomfortable and disconcerting. The costume design is killer, and mostly I thought the actor was doing a fine job. At times I thought his performance was lacking something, but I can't really put my finger on what it was -- sometimes it didn't feel clown-y enough to me, but I didn't hear that complaint from my movie partner. Maybe I'm being too harsh!Speaking of the acting, it was mostly on point, although there are two actors who can't really hold it together. The first is the Cat Lady who just didn't convince me and was kind of superfluous anyway; the second is the older sister upon whose shoulders rests the latter act(s). She was a convincing older sister: a cool, self-assured attitude and guardianship. But she was not great at playing a young woman who was scared for her life. Clearly she's not a bad actor but this didn't really play to her strengths.Final thoughts: The movie runs a little long and could have benefited from more discipline in writing and editing. The gore effects ranged from really fun to stomach churning. It didn't really play with the formula of the genre at all."

Too drunk to drive, they go to a pizza parlor for food... enjoy from there...The movie overall had a poor script that lacked character development which kind of takes away the viewer from connecting before seeing their fateful end. The villain has no character development; he's just creepy. The overall gore torture, and violence in the film covered up the weak story line; the stupid protagonist decision making, etc. It prevented the film from being another bad movie you watch with friends and laugh. It has some really twisted moments. I mean really twisted moments. But I feel like the director was torn between making this a psychological film, and 80's slasher. His direction seemed to be lost and/or shifted in the middle of making this. Plus the so called twist at the end was not needed. It caused a ""Huh?"" moment.. it didn't make sense."

Later on we find the location that is the main focus of the film, a seemingly abandoned building that is being seen to by pest control as what has to be past midnight? (But I'm not going to get into that). Along with the many confusing plot holes, you never feel any real connection to any of the characters and they are killed off before you get the chance to. The main character you should be rooting for is killed off in the first half of the film leaving you with nothing but more gory murders. The reason only reason I've given the film 4/10 is because the visual effects are done extremely well and Art the Clown has an amazing screen presence that pulls you in. It just would have been better if he didn't appear in the right place at the right time and actually reflect the injuries he was receiving."

" Reviewing With Josh! ""Terrifier""
",0.0,-0.9684,2018-09-19 00:00:00,4,"Before I actually begin to review this new horror film I found on Netflix let me just say that this movie is beyond gross. This film is so gross that not even myself, a huge horror fan could not even cope with, and I have seen all eight Saw films. Terrifier truly lives up to its name and the clown is genuine creepy but the thing that this film is missing is a perfect story line and less disturbing gory scenes. This film released in 2017 was picked up by Netflix a year later to hoping to traumatise its audience like the film ""IT"". However this clown film surprisingly had me running.....for the toilet. I have seen many gore films but this one tops my list, literally. You don't get as much gore in a regular movie due to MPAA concerns but this film goes way beyond. Avoid this movie if you have a very uneasy stomach.Anyways the film Terrifier takes the story of an evil and very creepy looking clown named Art who then sees some new victims and begins terrorising and torturing the poor souls. By torturing I don't mean stretching or dunking or tickling a persons feet in the stocks, I mean literal bloody torture. What I thought about this film was that it just all over the place. There were too many scenes which I thought were pointless and did not really have me paying attention to the whole plot line. Even though there were some scares and tricks up their sleeve I just think that it was not as good as the director hoped. Terrifier is truly a one of a kind film that is perfect for the people that love a good ol clown horror film and especially for those with strong stomachs and their love to see a bunch of blood and guts coming out of a person. But if the film was more properly taken seriously and given it a better story line then this film would have been perhaps one of the greatest clown films every made. Unfortunately it does not live up to those expectations."

They knock the clown out several times but no one makes sure hes actually dead.

Character development is very important in any movie... you need that in order to connect with the story... maybe that's why I found the film so so so BAAAD....

One of the girls takes a selfie with him and he gives the other one a ring out of a candy machine in the corner. Not long after this the mean owner kicks him out, and the girl throws away the ring, and Art sets out for revenge. Or is there no motive, no rhyme or reason to his madness? What follows is 90 minutes of sheer terror and pure black comedy, as the characters wind up in an abandoned apartment building with only an exterminator and a mentally ill woman, and Art stalking them all. David Allen Thornton is absolutely brilliant as Art. He's unpredictable. Unhinged. Completely silent even when injured. Truly frightening. A surprisingly great clown performer. He has a bag of toys and he'll use anything at his disposal to dispatch his victims. Shocking gore and twists abound. My jaw dropped many times and I laughed out loud at so many of his awesome mannerisms. The lighting, cinematography and editing are all on point too and the whole thing has a very grindhouse feel. There's so much personality. The practical gore effects are excellent and the film doesn't shy away from showing you anything. And the moments of tension in between are palpable. This is a textbook great slasher film and I hope to see a lot more from this character and this director!"
" Art The Clown is the Next Freddy and Michael
",0.0,0.9804,2018-09-17 00:00:00,8,"This 2016 horror/thriller let's you reminisce in the feels of 80s/90s horror. Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton) can easily be the next Freddy or Michael Myers, with a very twisted pleasure in extreme torture. It's next level psychotic and just what this era of horror needs.
 We follow two girls, Tara (Jenna Kanell) and Dawn (Catherine Corcoran), on a late Halloween night. After a night out, they stop at a diner where they are faced with the psychotic clown who, little do they know, will show them what it means to be terrified.
We don't get the opportunity to learn about the clown in the film but from the end credits we learn his name is Art the Clown. His name isn't important in the movie at any point, but it definitely adds to the question, 'what is this clown's problem?'
If you've never seen Director Damien Leone's previous films, Terrifier (short film, 2011) or All Hallows' Eve (2013), I highly recommend them to be watched first. I didn't personally, but I went back full circle, and after watching all three films, I understood some more of Damian Leone's process in making Terrifier. He pulled a lot of the best scenes from the short film and adapted them in the full length film. The full length creates a more terrifying gorier version than the short, not because of the time differences, but the story that's told as well. Even if this 2016 film is the better version, I still recommend watching the short film for the fun in comparison.
For those of you who can't stand the sight of blood, or clowns for that matter, this film isn't for you. But if you crave all the sinister mayhem like myself, Terrifier is one you'll be sure to love."

He literally shoots himself in the head and then sits back up but he gets knocked down by a woman who sticks him in the side with a small knife. A typical horror movie will have someone who starts at the beginning and makes it to the end. That doesn't happen here.

Everyone rates this film and says there's ""no story"" or its ""pointless killing"", UM ITS A DAMN SLASHER WHO CARES. A killer doesn't need a backstory or a reason that's what makes Michael and Jason so terrifying, they just do it, to do it!

",0.0,0.9253,2018-09-15 00:00:00,4,"Stumbled upon this one on Netflix because the image of that clown was pretty creepy. I was able to sit through it without ever really wanting to turn it off, because being a fan of the slasher genre, your expectations need to be lo pretty much 95% of the time... The weakest aspects with TERRIFER are for sure the incredibly formulaic, unoriginal script with bland characters who make dumb decisions the entire time. The lead actors somewhat pull off the mediocre dialogue they're given to work with, but aren't strong enough to pull off the higher stake, emotional scenes. Based on the acting alone, it could have been a high budget student film for all I knew. On the bright side, Art the Clown is pretty unforgettable. The costume, the make-up, the whole vision of that villain makes the movie. He really does make you forget about Pennywise altogether. This is a truly sick, twisted, unsettling character to watch and it works because the actor (who I truly hope to never meet in real life) commits full heartedly to it. He really nailed the movements and facial expressions. Without mentioning any spoilers, there is a scene of him purely making faces at the lead girl, that is perhaps the scariest part of the entire movie. Yes, it's also got a retro 80's thing going on which also helps elevate the product a bit - I just wish they'd gone a bit more ""House of the Devil"" on it and focussed much more on building tension and creating a dark atmosphere than relying on cheap gore and mediocre effects. So if you want to see it, definitely don't expect to be emotionally invested with anything or anyone - but appreciate the birth of a (most likely) new horror icon in Art the clown."

What I didn't enjoy was the brutality for the sake of brutality; a good horror movie doesn't have to leave you feeling disgusted afterwards. Leaving some things up to the audience's imagination is how a good horror movie should be shot. The antagonist was menacing, although he was practically in every scene. Again, this doesn't leave much for the audience to wonder where he is or where he's going next. The movie kind of ended for me when the ""main"" girl died. It was so anticlimactic. I half expected she would have got away somehow, and like multiple characters in the movie, she had several opportunities to kill the clown but seemed persistent on hitting him once and running away. There wasn't an excessive amount of cliches (there's definitely a few), but the ones I did notice were really unforgiving *cough cough that ending*.Should you see this movie?

As I said, nothing new, but well done for what it is. Some of the visuals in this movie really bring it together with some excellent shots of violence and haunting creepiness that will stuck with most viewers after the credits roll.

Deciding to give the movie a chance, I expected bad acting and a non-nonsensical plot but was pleasantly surprised by both the acting and storyline. Art the clown was especially well acted, considering he doesn't speak the entire film. The actor's gestures and mannerisms made the character for me (especially in the restaurant scene), and I found him both gruesome and funny. While the plot wanes a bit the second half, there are standout moments - the scene where Art wears another person's skin a la Buffalo Bill, for example. While I enjoyed the film and the acting, I would have liked to have seen more character development for the sister and cat lady. Phenomenal acting by Pooya Mohseni (the cat lady) - she really brought depth to an underdeveloped character, and her desperation to care for ""Emily"" (a doll she thinks is her child) is palpable on screen. If Damien Leone makes a sequel, have the cat lady come back and give her a lead role. :)"
" Crazy Clown
",-0.34,0.4246,2018-09-11 00:00:00,8,"I was Bored so I came across this FILM. It didn't look That good but I was Bored how much more BORED can I be LOL. 
So i Watched it I give it a 8 out of 10 WHY?
Much better than I thought. It was Fast past, Very Creepy Clown, Very KIND of ridicule 80s KIND of Surprised and Camera Work on Cross Effects on MOVIE Fans we Love. The man that Played the Clown was only in like 5 MOVIES. But PLAYED the Creepy, Killing, Weirdo, Not Talking, Ugly, Slim, Clown. He didn't have to say anything but just the site of him was enough. So in my option that was GREAT in the FILM. It KIND of took you back a bit to the 70s and 80s FILM'S AGAIN. You didn't know what to expect.
Another reason why I give this FILM a 8 out of 10. Is because Low Budget and the Chicks and Staff still PRETTY HOT. But Fairy NEW and PRETTY AVERAGE. 
I also liked the scenes like old times. When your watching the Movie and you know what's going to happen. EXAMPLE ""OK DUMMY ONE CHICK WAS KILLED, RUN THE OTHER WAY, DON'T WALK MORE INTO THE BUILDING STUPID""
I love STUPID senses like that. It KIND of makes you giggle a bit. Then when the DUMMY gets KILLED. You KIND of feel BAD Lol. Like saying to yourself ""OH MAN SHE IS SO HOT""
Anyways I can go on but this in my option is a must watch FILM. If you have nothing to do AND want to WATCH HOT CHICKS. And STUPID GUYS, Get MURDED BYE a CRAZY ASS Clown."

" Cheers to the FX...and that's it.
",0.4767,-0.9905,2018-09-10 00:00:00,1,"First off I want to say cheers to the practical effects artists. It's not often anymore that you see a film not gushing with an overuse of digital effects, and this one certainly excelled in that respect. Great, believable effects that had some real substance to them.The rest of the movie? Misses every mark possible to make it an enjoyable experience...Let's start with story: there is none. Not bad, not poorly written....NONE. Now for characters...honestly there was one good character (the only one with even a shred of depth) and they killed her off at the halfway marker in the movie. From that point on they just kept ""introducing"" new ""characters"" to be mindlessly slaughtered in a very formulaic way. But at this point the killings were useless. You didn't know any of these characters so you couldn't possibly care if they died or not, thus removing all tension from the rest of the film. I literally didn't care at all what happened in the movie after the main character died, because she was the only one I knew. Some severe continuity issues...there were many but the biggest one was when the elder sister is trying to escape the clutches of the clown. She drops a pipe that she used to bust open a lock, and grabs on to the clown's hands in an attempt to stop him from choking her. In this scene you can clearly see her hands are empty (and no camera shot showing her picking anything else up), then it cuts to her throwing an empty fist backwards and towards the clown's face, and then it cuts to him being stabbed in the face??? Even framed through it....somehow made less sense that way. And finally..the ending....wow. First off, at no point did the script even hint at the realm of the supernatural. Then all of sudden, right at the end of the movie, the clown comes back to life?? It was a cheap ploy to ""setup"" a sequel, and as an audience member it just made me feel betrayed. Oh, and the older sister turns out to be the one who kills the reporter in the beginning of the movie??? Where's the motivation?If you want to strictly see some great practical effects and love gore then definitely check this movie out, but DO NOT watch it if you're looking for an enjoyable film experience."

Regarding Art's back story that people complain not knowing about, I don't mind. I enjoy mystery, especially with villains. It makes them more interesting. I really enjoyed the scene where Art has a empathetic moment with the homeless woman. He shows some vulnerability which I thought made him even more charming. The script had some cheesy parts and the homeless woman was too pretty to be homeless but not everything can be perfect so overall I thought the movie was awesome.I think if the director had a little more time to pay more attention to little details, like script and homeless woman for example, it would have enhanced the movie more. I loved it though!"

There's more blood and guts than you could ask for. There were parts of it that were suspenseful and creepy although overall it had this somewhat comical, gory 80s horror movie atmosphere.I really enjoyed the main character's look and his mannerisms. He's a really interesting looking fellow and I think they did a great job with his look. Aside from the killer clown, there are other main characters who happen to be attractive ladies and there's some nudity.Some parts of the movie were predictable although it does kind of have some surprises. Also there's almost borderline too much stupidity on the main female characters' parts, although I just assumed they purposely made it satirical.Another thing that was enjoyable about this movie is the fact that it starts off gross right from the beginning. They don't hesitate to jump right into it, so you're not sitting there waiting an hour for something to happen.Overall I thought this movie was funny and entertaining and I don't regret watching it."
" Drops the Ball
",0.0,-0.9747,2018-09-09 00:00:00,5,"All Hallows' Eve was an enjoyable, if a bit flawed, anthology, but Art the Clown was indeed the highlight. Throw him in an 80s-styled slasher as the main antagonist and the movie should already have an advantage. This could have been awesome. Unfortunately, it wasn't.I won't go into the gore and atmosphere. The movie isn't a complete loss in those regards. Where this film (and many other slashers lately) lose footing is the failure to formulate a story incorporating protagonists we can pull for. The problem was not at all Jenna Kanell's Tara or Catherine Corcoran's Dawn, our two leads who find themselves being followed by the clown from Hell on Halloween night. Until these two were captured and subsequently killed off, things were moving along quite nicely and eerily. I feared what was to come for these two, and they developed a level of likeability where I didn't want to any harm come to them.Focus then shifts to Samantha Scaffidi's Victoria, who COULD HAVE been a great surprise final girl. Yet, when it came down to it, the character continued to make completely stupid decisions to the point of frustration. This I will never understand about these movies. Sure, some have themselves an incredibly creepy, capable antagonist (and, make no mistake, the scenes with Art the Clown were GREAT), but the characters we are supposed to root for are created with little to no regard. My opinion is that behind every boogeyman, there should be a resourceful final girl to pull for to balance the forces of good and evil. All the good slashers have that component, but many lately seem to be going for shock instead and fall into obscurity as a result.For that reason, I say bin this one and hope that the next one will be better. 5 out of 10."

" No Better Title
",0.1779,-0.7762,2018-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Nice to know: Evil never dies...as in the Evil Slasher.Just when I still think the horror market is too heavily aimed at the specific subgenre: Ghost/Haunted House stories - heck, the ghost story, The Nun, opens this weekend, I applaud filmmakers who step out of the box to make films for real diehard horror fans. In this case, my favorite horror subgenre: the Slasher.The absolute only thing that Terrifier changes from the Slasher subgenre is the stereotypical woodsy setting. It is on-point perfection with handling this once great horror dominator. So, if you love the Slasher like I do, you MUST see this film.Not much to say for the synopsis, it starts with a twist and then dives into the hunter stalking its prey. For what's unoriginal in the script, it makes up for it tenfold with extremely effective gore FX and the twist.Frankly, one of the two twists is easy to see but the second one did get me. Also love to see non-CGI, practical effects and this looked like straight up heart from filmmakers...despite the budget.And talk about a mask. Slasher films have constantly tried to reinvent the killer's mask. Of course we have the big three: Michael Myers' William Shatner, Jason Voorhees' Hockey Mask and Leatherface's, well, Leatherface and a fourth could be granted to Scream. But, since then, they haven't been all that impressive. In fact, one of my favorite modern Slashers, The Final Girls, had an obnoxiously bad mask to mock the previous and failed attempts. Most recently, Happy Death Day's was also fairly bad.But, DAMN... Terrifier's is one of the best. Sure, it's part American Horror Story: Freak Show, but Terrifier totally took it to the edge and went over. Recently, I attended Arizona's Mad Monster horror convention and the actor playing Terrifier, or ""Art the Clown,"" David Howard Thornton was there. I got pictures, but sadly, didn't introduce myself. Also, regrettably, I hadn't seen the movie at the time. I probably definitely would've spoken with him and praise his performance as the mute, funny and absolutely terrifying clown. Not much more to say other than this is HIGHLY recommended for real horror fans.***Final thoughts: Funny how the mouth of Terrifier COMPLETELY works on me and the similarly looking mouth on The Nun just cracks me up. Perhaps it's the lame CGI on The Nun or the fact that story couldn't happen. But, damn, not even comparatively speaking, Thornton deserves an Oscar for his facial expressions alone and the Nun should just brush her computer generated teeth."

That way, I can be surprised when it's actually good, and this one was!Obviously it's built around cliches, the acting isn't top notch, the writing is nothing special, it's a horror movie. You're not watching Nolan here. The thing that makes this movie great is the mime/clown/whatever he is. It's no exaggeration that he's one of if not the most terrifying killer clowns in film history. He makes you laugh with his extreme creepiness.The other reason to watch this (kind of messed up, but some people love it) is the gore. Practical special effects were used for all of the numerous shots of some truly messed up stuff. Easily some of the most vomit-inducing gore effects I've ever seen. The saw scene? Holy mother of god, there's a limit they surpassed that I've rarely seen before. I was cackling uncontrollably for most of the gore scenes in both disbelief of what I was seeing, and absolute disgust. The cliches and some other sub-par qualities add some good fodder for a bit of riffing, one of my favourite things about watching horror movies. Sure, comparing this to the greats will score it very low. But compare it to most of the horror schlock that gets pumped out every year and it's definitely better than many."
" Solid
",0.1531,0.847,2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"Very solid, considering the budget. Never playing it safe. Ok use of practical effects. More entertaining than 85% of what Hollywood is pumping out, with their massive budgets. Has the ingredients that somewhat reminesce older style splatter, with the acting and gruesome gore, even the background 80's style synths in some scenes. The lighting was atmospheric within a lot of scenes. Very unsettling performance from Art, and at times entertaining as hell. props to the actor. You can definitely see his mime background shine within the character and it works incredibly. Facial gestures were not what you see in most scares, the Pizza Inn especially. I really loved the actress' performance who played Tara, and the moment she died was when this movie went up a couple notches, stake-wise. It was a damn shame that she did, but it stayed real. Those 2 were the best performers in this, in my opinion. 
The pest control guy should've stomped Art's head in when he had the chance. Instead, he received that said fate LOL. Dumbass!"

It really brings back that ambience that 80's slashers created around you when you watched them years ago. Cheesy enough to remind you that it's just a silly scary movie but with the brutality and ingenuity to keep you interested. This movie is gory, and the killer is legitimately scary. They did a great job with his look and mannerisms, so much so that as I scrolled through Netflix I did a double-take as I passed by Terrifier like I was a teenage boy admiring a pair of double D's. I had a gut feeling this movie would be impressive the moment I saw it and I was right. Spend 82 minutes with Art, you won't be disappointed unless you are a basic b."

" An awesome villain but not much story
",0.0644,-0.9936,2018-09-08 00:00:00,6,"Terrifier:
Written and directed by Damien LeoneI was drawn in by the hypnotic grin of Art the Clown. Those angular features, that little hat perched to one side on top of his head, his wicked smile. Art the Clown is an incredibly well designed villain. He grabs your attention almost immediately from appearance alone. That is the main reason I decided to give this horror flick a whirl. This movie is gross. It features over the top and intense gore scenes. The gore is so excessive that things become rather comical. I'm not entirely certain it was meant to be comical but I think it might have been. Art is the hero in this film. They open the movie on him donning his costume and loading up his weapons like the beginning of a superhero film. So much was put into this character and so much was put into the gore effects that there wasn't much left for the rest of the movie.The story falls flat completely. The acting is abyssmal all around. The lines they're given to say hurts your brain. Now this is not necessarily a deal breaker in horror movies. It doesn't ruin this movie. What ruins what good will the character design and effects gives you is the utter stupidity of the main characters. They do things that will make you second guess your thought process if you're thinking even a little bit. Art gets to them way too easily so any suspense the movie seems to be trying for fails miserably. We're just stuck sitting there waiting to see what horrible death Art has planned for them. That's not much of a story and even the one that's there is filled with a whole lot of hot air. I really do like the design of Art the Clown. I think he's an interesting, creepy character and I truly believe this has the potential to be finessed into a workable horror franchise. The actor playing Art is so expressive in just his body language. I'm torn about this one. The hazy camera work that showed its ugly head in the middle of the movie onwards til the end bothered me because the beginning didn't have that problem. The victims are dumb as a headless chicken taking an oratory class. There's no story and no real tension but the effects and kills were superb and the villain is really cool looking. I'll give this one a C."

Surprisingly all the characters who have opportunities to kill the clown, act the same and run away instead of killing him like they all have the same personalities , which obviously represent the lack of characterizations.
However, lack of using many dialogues and musics could be a distinction point of this movie with others of this genre; Although, in order to make this matter look more professional, it absolutly needs more effort and knowledge from the director."

He falls. Girl runs. Clown catches back up.Clown was awesome. As brutal as this was, he had me chuckling. Hes the reason I kept watching. He pushed the rating to a 6.

" A lot of gore and good gore.
",0.4404,0.9687,2018-09-04 00:00:00,7,"I love gore movies. I don't watch them often, but occasionally I'll feel the itch. When I do, I look to movies like this. Just pure gore, no fillers or preservatives. Don't worry about anything else. Hatchet and its sequels have done a nice job bringing gore back into the mainstream horror genre. Or somewhat mainstream. The use of real bodies and no CGI is a great thing to enhance the idea of the gore. The characters are mainly bozos running around with empty heads searching for their brains but not remembering that they have phones in their hands and could call 911 at any time. Like Tara's sister. She sees Tara's friend sawed in half. She then proceeds to spend the next few minutes running around with a cellphone in her hand. Hmm. Cops maybe. I know, then it would be more realistic. I know. If this college student couldn't think to call 911 after seeing a girl sawed in half, then better off for the viewer. It is funny how frigging dumb people really are in horror movies. Just plain idiots. Other than the obvious moronic characters, the movie is a gut spilling delight with lots of blood and body parts. Fun times for all!"

I'd love some more background info on Art. Definitely hope for more Art sequels.

Well, Terrifier holds your answer.If you are afraid of clowns, stay away from this movie.If you are squeamish about gore, don't even start watching it.Basically, just know that this one goes all the way. And then some. It's like someone told the filmmakers that they were in Italy in 1980 and had bought stock in latex, food coloring and corn syrup.Al the Clown first showed up in the anthology film All Hallow's Eve. Now, he's back, as the film opens on a talk show hostess interviewing the only survivor of a massacre where she was the only survivor. As the host asks if the woman saw her attacker die, we pull back to reveal Al the Clown destroying a TV set.Following the interview, we hear the talk show host make fun of the mutilated victim, who soon shows up to gouge out her eyes.If you've made it this far, you haven't seen anything yet.After a night of partying, Tara and Dawn are walking down the street and encounter Al carrying a bag of weapons. Dawn yells at him as Tara tells her to settle down. They decide to sober up at a pizza shop when the clown shows up again, leading to Dawn taking selfies with him. Al gets up and gives Tara a toy ring before the owner kicks him out.The girls return to their car to find their tires slashed and have to call Tara's sister for a ride. They're going better than the pizza shop employees, who are quickly butchered and decimated by the sinister clown. Soon, Tara and Dawn are captured by Al and Tara is forced to watch Dawn get...well, I don't want to ruin it. But I will say that this was the exact moment that Becca got upset and shut off the blu ray. It's that unexpected and intense.Needless to say, this is the slasher for those of you who have been waiting for a modern version that can live up to movies like The Prowler. My disclaimer above is no joke: this is one brutal movie filled with gallons upon gallons of teh red stuff.David Howard Thornton, who plays Art, is amazing. He imbues the character with sheer menace and you can see that his mime training really pays off. He's creepy just sitting there or walking on by. Once he gets on a tricycle or starts killing everyone in his path, he gets downright terrifying. Hey - the title makes sense. Director Damien Leone also directed All Hallow's Eve and Frankenstein vs. The Mummy and is someone to watch. Unlike so many modern horror movies, there's definitely attention paid to mood, pacing, color and lighting."
" My Review Of ""Terrifier""
",0.0,0.5602,2018-09-03 00:00:00,9,"""Terrifier"" is an atmospheric, all out gorefest. The film is a total tribute to 80's horror, but it is so much more. Where most throwbacks mimic, or recreate the 80's vibe, ""Terrifier"" redefines what a successful throwback should do. Damien Leone has taken the style of early giallo, filled with gritty, low-fi concepts, and mixed in an almost grindhouse level of brutality and gore. And he does so while making it look natural and original instead of ""copycat"".The acting is sustainsble beyond the typical low-budget affair. Limited in dialog, what is utilized is the classic, slightly camp appeal of traditional characters. The cast know their parts and play them well. Void of the heavy, often times cumbersome, back story, or info-rich dialog, ""Terrifier"" gives the right amount of character study to set them up as affectational victims. Art is the centerpiece and his psych-centric stylings are enough to mesmerize and disgust. Kudos to Thornton for taking what could have been a death nail character, and creating a truly skin crawling, terrifying clown killer.The special effects areaeesome, minus a couple CGI blood splatter moments, ""Terrifier"" keeps with quality, practical effects. And Leone gives it to us in full frontal, gory gratuity. Not shy or intimidated by lack of effectiveness, the camera keeps focus on the carnage as it happens. It is 100% a top-notch gorehound celebration in visceral, bloody fun. This movie has American giallo eyes with a slasher smile. A definite watch for horror fans who think a stomach turning moment is a plus."

Michael Myers was terrifying because he was just a soulless little boy who became a soulless man. No background or explanation needed. Dr. Loomis laid his backstory out there for us. Terrifier had creepy moments but I was never invested in the characters. It had plenty of gore and that's fine, if that's your thing but torture porn and genuinely scary cinema are two vastly different things. Comparing this movie to 'Halloween' is an insult."

His character had no lines, so no words were spoken by him which made him even more chilling. Psychotic killers with big smiles will always be disturbing, and this film did that well. He was the star of the film and managed to keep me interested the entire journey. His face is one that will haunt my dreams and probably yours.."

But that material only takes about a few minutes of the total running time, and if you take that away, what you have is a completely worthless movie. Other IMDb comments that the movie is plotless and thin with its characters are correct; this is just one person after another being slaughtered, with no new angles, and no story. It gets really boring very quickly. It's even more painful than it sounds, one big reason that the movie has some of the ugliest cinematography that has ever been presented in a movie. I hope the filmmakers don't clown around on a future film project."

Its very disturbing, but its not a gore fest (i hate those). Nice horror flick for those who love this genre, for all others - you better stay far away from this movie."
" Killings without any story, but the scariest horror-clown ever!
",-0.4664,0.4166,2018-08-17 00:00:00,4,"This is a movie without any purpose or coherent story: it's just about killing again and again, in the most cruel and gruesome ways, visualized as graphic as modern special effects can produce. If you are into gore, you'll have a real ball, but if you appreciate at least some background or characterization you will be disappointed. The first say twenty minutes were promising enough, the way the clown was teasing both women was very inventive: funny and extremely creepy at the same time. And surely: this must be one of the nastiest, scariest looking horror-clowns ever, I grant them that! But when the cat-and-mouse game turns into a killing-spree, it's a fast down-hill ride: characters are not important anymore, there are no dialogues whatsoever apart from the screaming, and the feeling of repetition prevails. It's hard to judge any acting abilities: although both girls do an adequate job in the introduction, they are soon reduced to crawling and screaming victims. But the clown is great in his own weird and scary way, his mimics are top of the notch. So just for him and the special effects I still rank it 4 out of 10."

The acting is subpar and at times the attacks were not even convincing with bad editing and lazy movements, 2 *'s instead of 1* the only redeemable features are the clown having a unique style that could of worked in another film that had a good story, some of the shots are semi-decent and I appreciate the use of real gore effects over CGI.

Especially because horror film presents the tension, fear and struggle of the people who are the victims of the evil character in the movie.Why is it fun for me to watch? Maybe it's because I enjoy challenges and likes to see someone who struggles and finally overcome those challenges and difficulties.Therefore, I feel so much disappointed with the way of thinking of this filmmaker who did not give a chance to the people who struggle to survive from that evil clown.This film is full of despair and tends to side with evil. This film does not make a person have a passion for struggling because any hard struggle seems to be in vain before that devil clown that is not even explained from where it came from.This kind of film is not educational nor entertaining at all. I tend to think that only people with problems in their souls can make a movie full of despair and no-hope situation like this.I strongly recommend that this kind of poor quality film never be watched again."

The woman cut in half jiggled like rubber and I am not sure you can cut that much bone with a hacksaw blade. It would have been good if the clown had a pantomime act. Tara (Jenna Kanell) comes across as the final girl. Without a back story the film was rather plot-less. Blood, clown, disfigured face. Guide: F-word.

There are seldom low-budget films that actually deliver, and this is my current favorite. Art the Clown is far superior as a horror villain because he has more style and personality (albeit silent) than the other offerings that are currently available (I'm looking at you, Victor Crowley). The masterful use of practical effects also elevates this film from the current IT incarnation. Murderous clowns have been done many times, but Art is the real deal; just when you think he may have some humanity he proves otherwise: ""Oh, he's not so bad...wait...WHAT?...holy crap, he's pure evil and loving it!"". I know the end somewhat set this up for a sequel, but I kinda hope it's left as a great ""one and done"". There's a lot of crappy horror movies out there, and this is destined to be a cult favorite.

The owner throws him out after he fouls the bathroom and it was a serious mistake. Buckets of blood ensue, with many innocent victims. They all wind up in a warehouse where more mayhem ensues. A woman is hung upside down and cut in half with a hacksaw, so if you are looking for a fun film, this ain't it. Overall, just some bad acting and a sub par script make for an average horror movie."
" Not seeing how this movie rates an 8!! *SPOILERS*
",0.0,-0.9895,2018-05-06 00:00:00,5,"I grudgingly give this film a 5 for it's opening 1/2 hour or so and some fairly creepy moments, but it all goes downhill from there in my opinion as most films of this kind do. Ok yes, the clown is pretty creepy and yes there are some downright gruesome scenes. At first, him being a mime lends to the creepiness, but as the movie goes on it tends to take away from the creepiness in my opinion as he just makes funny faces and bloody teeth smiles, not to mention giving the finger to one of his attackers!! But the movie contains many if not most of the tired cliche's we are used to in these kinds of slasher films. 
 This includes the OFT repeated phrase ""Hello, is there anybody here?"".....great for letting the killer know your whereabouts of course. Having the killer dead to rights flat on his face, stabbing him once in the back, and then stabbing him 20 more times till dead...right???....NOOO how about running off!! And of the course the ""indestructible villain"", who continues to live after being stabbed multiple times in different parts of his body and bashed in the head HARD numerous times with 2x4's and several other different objects. Isn't this just a guy in a clown outfit?? AND OF COURSE coming back to life at the morgue after blowing his brains out in the previous scene. I don't think any of this lends to the films feel or creepiness, which at times does work and makes one squirm. 
 The acting is passable, especially in the first 1/2 hour or so...fairly engaging and believable. But some characters who appear later just don't make much sense and the acting regresses to B-movie fare. Those working and living in the what is seemingly an abandoned or shut-down warehous include a seemingly homeless woman who caresses and carries around a doll acting as if it is her real child?? Ummm, why?? An exterminator who happens to be working in the wee hours on halloween exterminating rats in said warehouse?? He is pretty much only there to allow access to the warehouse bathroom (and the domain of the killer clown) for our main female character to relieve herself after a hard night of partying with her flirtatious and fairly mindless companion. A companion who oddly seems to take a shine to the creepy clown (shooting selfies with him in the restaurant towards the start of the film), as opposed to being repulsed by his leering and creepy ways. How about a cliche' scene where said exterminator is wearing ear-buds listening to music as our protagonist SCREAMS LOUDLY for help as she is being whisked away by Art the Clown?? Convenient noise cancelling on those headphones...lol!!
 To me, the film really goes downhill once the action turns to the warehouse. The killer clown who finds his victims no matter how far they run from him or how well they hide, the nonsensical addition of the crazy homeless woman, the bumbling exterminator's boss who comes to try and rescue him after getting a distress call on his cellphone, and the sister of our main character who sets out to come to their rescue when the car they are driving receives the obligatory flat tire. She obviously gets roped into the creepiness at the warehouse after the clown himself texts for her ""to come around the back, your sister is sick"". She lives to tell the tale even though her scalp and breasts are skinned and worn by the clown in one of his more creepy scenes. She then is revealed as the horribly disfigured girl shown in the opening scene, who is being interviewed by a female journalist and being labelled the ""only survivor of the massacre"".
 Very good first half- hour to 45 minutes give the film a real chance, but the director seems to fall into the same old horror tropes and types no matter how gruesome the blood and gore gets. Watchable, but don't expect any ground-breaking ideas or outcome!!"

Then comes along this boneless spin off & an all to bad of an excuse to have that clown, Art back again!The film is about Art the clown. But is a typical cat & mouse film with no plot or even a point other than the sake of Art himself. Pointless. Now I'm not usually the one to complain about films having points or reason but this film took the pi$$ so much, I felt adding a review & saying that was justified!The film had the gore, the bloody violence, the sexy babes, the viciousness & the epic kills! The works! The only hing or 2 things it lacked, were the plot & of course the damn POINT!!Withe exception of the gory violence, kills & fear, not to mention, Catherine Corcrocan! (Hottie!!) This film failed to justified its existence! Sadly! It was like a human body with bone! Even as I watched the film I was expecting the 2 babes at the start to die & then a the main story to break in. But it didn't! The film dragged & dragged! Even with the gory horror action violence, it simply didn't cut it!3/10 is generous enough given the content! But it sadly lacked the point & plot to justify it!"
" The creepiest clown in movies.
",0.0,-0.9493,2018-04-19 00:00:00,6,"I must say, Art the clown is far creepier than any other clowns in horror movies. Pennywise from the 2017 IT can not compare to Art. The design and the way Art mimes and taunts his victims are extremely well down and unsettling. But, the movie on whole is just above average, it starts out great, with the clown stalking to girls late Halloween night. The first part is way better than the second half, although the kills are extremely violent, it's so cartoony and over the top it's almost laughable. The atmosphere is alright, it takes place is some type of abandoned warehouse. Like I said, the second part of the movie somewhat drags and their are many cliches and dumb character decisions that are typical in horror movies.
So, I would probably recommend this movie, but mostly just to see how creepy the main clown antagonist is. I really think this is by far the scariest clown I have seen, and I am not one of the many scared by them."
" Art the Clown for me takes #1 spot for cinema's scariest clown. Pennywise, beware!
",0.0,0.9889,2018-04-18 00:00:00,9,"This film was amazing. It's a low budget film, but this movie does not let that take away from how great this movie is. The kills are very gruesome and all practical. I love the cinematography in this film. It really shows that you don't have to be a big name director with millions of dollars in Hollywood to make something amazing and impressive. This film is very reminiscent of 80s slasher flicks, and there are references throughout the film. The soundtrack even says it. I loved the music in this movie. It really makes me wanna buy the soundtrack for myself. I have like two grips, and they aren't as big. One, the beginning to me was king of weird and doesn't make as much sense (not talking about the intro into the film. I loved the intro. A little after the intro). And two, one of the characters were weird to me, and kind of felt a little out of place. Like, this character feels a little underdeveloped. Besides all of this, I loved this movie. Art the Clown is seriously an amazing Horror villain, and I really wanna see more of him. He is the scariest clown for me, and he really gives Pennywise a run for his money. I really want him to get his own franchise."
" One will be terrified of this clown
",-0.6124,0.8035,2018-04-17 00:00:00,6,"'Terrifier's' cover looked very cool and eerie. Furthermore, the concept was really intriguing and one of the best for any film personally seen recently. There are some halfway decent killer clown films out there and have an appreciation for horror. So yes 'Terrifier' was watched with some anticipation and want to like it, as well as some apprehension with so many wastes of potential on recent film viewings. While it is an uneven film, where the first half is better than the second half, 'Terrifier' turned out to be much better than expected. Considering the budget and there are also a fair share of killer clown films that are not good ('Clowntergeist' was a significant recent example in this regard), it could easily have been a bad film if executed in a way that wasted its promise. Luckily, 'Terrifier' didn't fully live up to its promise but it doesn't waste it either.Quite a lot to like here. 'Terrifier' starts off really well, great even. Despite the slightness of the story that doesn't really do anything new, the first half was tightly paced and genuinely scary and suspenseful with well-timed shocks. The killings are gory, without being gratuitously so while not holding back, nail-biting and inventive. Enjoyed the 80s throwback feel to the atmosphere.Visually, 'Terrifier' looks pretty impressive for a film made on a high-budget. It's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and atmospherically lit. The make-up and effects were surprisingly and refreshingly good, seeing as there have been so many recent film viewings where the make up and effects looked terrible that was a real pleasure to see. The killer clown Art is truly freaky and is up there with Pennywise actually as the stuff of nightmares.Acting from the main cast is better than average, with a likeable lead actress and a fiendishly good David Howard Thornton. It's all competently directed and there is a real eeriness too to the music score. However, 'Terrifier' sadly has a second half that is not up to the same level. Although there is creepiness, suspense and a few of the killings are inventive, the thinness of the story affects the momentum and things become dull, silly and repetitive, there is a pattern here and one that repeats itself so often that it becomes very predictable quickly. The ending felt rushed and incomplete, leaving the viewer in dumbfounded confusion. Not that 'Terrifier' was perfect already, it wasn't, but the flaws are more apparent and more problematic in the second half than the first. Not enough of the characters are rootable or interesting enough, with the most likeable characters disappearing too early and any development is sketchy and cliched. The lead character and oddly enough Art are the most interesting characters here. Although the main cast are fine, the side characters are very annoying in how they are written and portrayed. There are also too many annoying and illogical actions and decision-making which made parts hard to swallow and ridiculous. Too much of the script is limp, ridden with clichés and too often underdeveloped and silly. Overall, pretty decent with a lot of good merits although with significant problems. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

First off, this film is a hardcore slasher/gore film. In this department they do pretty well.Also that retro/80s hipster tint is getting overused. Overall a decent movie to put on for a slasher horror with guy friends."

",0.3612,-0.9857,2018-04-13 00:00:00,3,"Is it a decent watch? I'd say yes, for the gore and the kills. Is it a good movie? No. Just too many dumb moments made by the characters. I understand that's majority of horror movies having the dumb decisions some of the characters make. In this movie though it's just ridiculous. Tara (The dark haired main character) has plenty of opportunities to kill the clown over and over. Also killing off the main two characters basically in the first half of the movie was a horrible idea, different yes, still horrible though. The only two people we somewhat started connecting with and caring for get killed early in the movie. Overall this movie isn't worth the 1HR 22Min runtime. Cut it off halfway, after the main characters die and you won't regret it."

" Move over Pennywise.
",0.0,-0.9675,2018-04-12 00:00:00,9,"Expanded from director Damien Leone's 2011 short of the same name, Terrifier stars David Howard Thornton as silent psycho killer Art the Clown, who turns Halloween into a nightmare for several unfortunate victims, including friends Tara and Dawn (Jenna Kanell and Catherine Corcoran), and Dawn's big sister Victoria (Samantha Scaffidi).Although you might reasonably think that we need another scary clown movie like we need a pie in the face, Terrifier actually takes the clown horror sub-genre to a whole new level with a grease-painted maniac who makes Pennywise look like Krusty Krustofsky.Not only is Art one of the creepiest looking clowns in horror, but he's also one of the most violent, making a real mess of his victims. While the plot of Terrifier is about as original as a water-squirt flower, and features characters who make dubious decisions that inevitably put them in further peril (including that old favourite, not finishing off the villain when given the chance), it is the that gore maketh the movie, Art making good use of a variety of tools. The gruesome highlight sees an almost naked victim (I won't say who) suspended upside-down and sawn vertically in half, starting at the crotch (nasty), but there are plenty of other incredibly splattery moments, including bullets to the face and a very bloody decapitation. The prosthetic effects (no CGI here folks!) are excellent and guaranteed to please avid gorehounds.The film ends on a predictable note, with Art returning from the dead Jason Vorhees style, but if that allows for a sequel, then that's fine by me.8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."

" "" TERRIFIER "" kept me pretty Terrified the whole way through. NOW THE TITLE MAKES SENSE.
",-0.2023,-0.7054,2018-04-11 00:00:00,7,"This film review will be my shortest review because with horror slasher flicks it's pretty hard to not give away spoilers but I always thought the clown from the film "" IT ""was in a league of his own but I would dare to say he now has some company. From the opening credits until the credits end and roll this film 
does the trick of keeping you terrified. Albeit the title ""Terrifier"" but it doesn't stop there the movies antagonist we'll call him terrifying clown is not only a psychopath but the mystery behind why? his look, his walk how he moves on screen keeps your horrified meter on atleast 8 all the way through. This feeling will continue to grow more and more as the movie progresses. 
Now there are little things as far as the ending seemed rushed and forgettable and thats something writers and directors battle with in post production but hey for a movie to come out of left field and smack me by surprise i was highly entertained AND SO therefore that makes this A GOOD MOVIE RATING. 
IF you like horror slasher flicks and hate clowns like me try 
"" TERRIFIER "" on for size it won't disappoint."
" Terrific!

Wow! I only just read an interview with the films director Damien Leone today and managed to stream it online and boy was I impressed! It's obviously low budget but this is proof that in the right hands it doesn't matter. This is a relentless and very gory killer clown slasher flick that makes good use of it's filming location and also packs in plenty of tension. It also makes IT look incredibly tame."
" Creepiest Clown Ever!!
",0.0,0.8538,2018-04-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie was creepy from start to finish! Could the plot have been better? Sure. Was there even a plot to begin with? Yes. The plot was a clown trying to kill everyone in his way because he lives to kill. It's a horror movie and it excels in being a horror movie because it creeped me out nearly the entire way through. The clown is the same clown from the movie All Hallows Eve and his name is Art. Art makes Pennywise look like a children's birthday performer. Terrifier has a great feel to it. It feels like an 80's slasher flick with a modern twist. Almost the entire movie has a dark feel to it with dark sets such as the old rundown apartment building. This movie is excellent in my opinion. I hardly ever get scared or creeped out by a movie but this movie achieved what many other horror movies didn't: it creeped me out. The facial expressions of Art are one of the things that makes him so scary and he doesn't have to say a word. I really hope that a Terrifier 2 comes out in the future. If you're a horror fan than I say see this movie. It's great. It was so good, in my opinion that I'm making my very first IMBD review. Go see it and enjoy!"
" An awesome nod to 80s horror!
",0.1759,-0.5239,2018-04-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a great new horror film, let me start off by saying that. I did watch ""All Hallows Eve"" and it wasn't terrible but it wasn't the best. It was lacking in some parts for example the costumes. Seeing the trailer for this movie though made me want to see this. Clowns do not scare me, I find nothing scary about them at all however this villain; Art the clown makes me rethink that thought. This clown was brilliant. He does not speak; he only moves in a comedic yet creepy way. He is like the Michael Myers of killer clowns. The actions are all you get; no silly lines or catch phrases. So bravo to this new movie villain! The acting was pretty good, the special effects were awesome (no CGI that I despise) and overall a great story. A basic story idea that is something out of the 80s slasher universe but maybe thats something us horror fans have been waiting for? This is a breath of fresh air from all the garbage remakes and unoriginal horror films out there now. This movie will make any horror fan scream for joy as it is original, weird at times and never boring. There are many nods to various horror films of the past (from Halloween to Silence Of The Lambs) Its bloody and creepy. Two thumbs up from this horror fanatic!"

Until the moment Tara and Dawn are abducted, the film works reasonably well. However, when Victoria drives to give a ride to her sister and Dawn, she hears that there is a serial killer in the area. But even being aware of the dangerous situation, she begins to take a series of very stupid e clichés attitudes culminating in the awful conclusion. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): Not Available"

This movie unfortunately did that and it bugged me. You have no background history on the clown either. Being Halloween, you don't even see kids on the street trick or treating, no parties, no Halloween festivities. I would have liked to know who the clown was, what his/her background was leading up to what they did in the movie. The ending also left much to be desired. Ok, it was evil, but where did it come from? I am being generous with a 4 only because I love gore and this movie did not come up short on that at all, probably the best part of it."

I'm not saying this is necessarily bad - Terrifier has a kind of directness and purity that I'm sure many slasher/horror fans appreciate. I just need a bit more than violence for it's own sake. I like a villain with a bit of a back story - any story - any story at all? No questions are answered - who, what, when, where, why? Again, I'm sure that someone could tell me why none of this matters with regarding this particular movie, and what Terrifier actually does. Which is?Horrific violence done with incredible, practical effects. These effects must be seen to be understood. They are effects that make you feel emotion, horror and true discomfort. Can't remember the media reference: book, movie, TV show - but the villain talked about the space between when someone is alive, and when they become an inanimate thing. This can happen in infinite ways, and the writer director of this movie prefers intense physical trauma. His ability to first introduce an actor, then show a brutal death with gory effects, then show the corpse being mutilated? This movie is at the top of that list! No small feat to be sure. I can't even imagine the work that goes into these scenes, and how to make it work in the editing room after the fact. These scenes are the work of a master in this specific area - practical fangora style effects. This guy needs more jobs in Big Budget films!But that is my opinion, and what I feel Terrifier brings to the table in terms of merit. But also, in my opinion, get this guy a script please! His direction isn't bad! I thought the actors had a kind of believable nature with their dialog and actions. His effect work is jaw dropping (maybe jaw removing?). But this movie has very little content, and almost zero point or depth of meaning. For some, this approach may be admirable, even ideal - but I want a more rounded film with something to actually say.great effects/shallow content: 6 out of 10"

",0.2755,-0.9765,2018-04-03 00:00:00,10,"I have to say Art The Clown is the most terrifying clown I have ever watched. He's without conscience. He's unmerciful and methodical. He's sadistic, there's no telling how far he will go because there's no limits to his evilness. Art grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go. This is why there's a phobia of clowns. If you looked up upcoulrophobia in the dictionary his picture should be right beside it. He's unnerving to say the least. One look at him fills you with dread and dispair. The movie IT was great but pennywise didn't fill me with fear where Art did. Art is psychopath on a relentless quest of death and torture. Enter Arts world at your own risk because you will never look at clowns the same way"

" It will take you to places you didn't know you wanted to go
",0.0,-0.9021,2018-04-03 00:00:00,10,"I saw the trailer for 'Terrfier' about a fortnight ago and thought it looked good, but had been burned by low-budget horror movies with promising trailers that turn out to be rubbish too many time before. So I decided to give it a miss until last night when I heard it getting some positive buzz. I was surprised anyone else had even heard about it, let alone enjoyed it. So I decided that was enough for me and put it on to watch. What I ended up witnessing was one of the most unique and brilliant horror films I've ever seen.It should be known that very little ever bothers me any longer in the way of horror movies. I want them to effect me, they just don't. I feel like I've seen it all and have become numb to anything the movie-making industry can throw at me. So when I say that 'Terrifier' had me on the edge of my seat, make no mistake, that is a glowing endorsement. The film was creepy as hell. 'Art The Clown' is one of the best created horror movie characters I can ever remember. The film clearly has a low-budget, but I think that helps it in a lot of ways. An unknown cast and a creepy abandoned warehouse setting are ideal for a horror movie because it leaves the audience with no comfort to fall back on. When you think you're getting scared in a movie and then Nicole Kidman enters the frame and reminds you of how much you liked her in 'Just Go With It' it can completely take you out of the film. There is certainly none of that here. The other thing I liked is that absolutely no character feels safe. Too often with horror movies people are dying left, right and centre, yet there are the characters that you know are untouchable, and thus every scene with them in danger loses its edge. You have to watch the film to appreciate how far from the case that is here. Let me guarantee you though by saying - more so than any film I've ever seen before no one is safe. Writer/director Damien Leone clearly knows horror and what makes people tick. He's put on a masterful display here and I can't wait to check out his previous film (also featuring 'Art The Clown') 'All Hallows' Eve'. 'Terrifier' has some of the most unique, brilliant, disturbing and somehow thoughtful scenes you will ever see in a movie (let alone a horror movie). It is a must-see."
" YES!! Amazingly disturbing!
",-0.2584,-0.4753,2018-04-03 00:00:00,10,"Damien Leone hit a homerun with the much anticipated full theatrical release of ""Terrifier."" I've been patiently waiting for this ever since I saw the short back in 2011. Genuine horror at its finest. Disturbing sequences start right away. Leone holds nothing back during the full runtime. The kills are as gory as can be and the sheer creepiness of Art the Clown throughout keeps you entertained the whole way through. True horror aficionados will love this flick as much as I did. Looking forward to anything Leone touches. Solid 10 from me. Well done!"
" What Horror Should Be
",-0.5719,0.9962,2018-04-02 00:00:00,7,"This is the way horror should be, creepy, unnerving, gory, and most of all a great time! Terrifier is something I have been waiting for since my first time watching Damien Leone's All Hallows Eve, from the very beginning of that movie I was obsessed with this Art the Clown character, and I truly couldn't get enough of him. Now finally Art has arrived in his own feature length film, and after watching Terrifier I am still wanting more of the most terrifying clown ever put to film.
The plot is not unlike that of other slasher films, we follow two girls the lead played by Jenna Kanell, who come across a menacing clown named Art, after their car tires are slashed the night turns into a nightmare as the evil clown will stop at nothing to torture and torment his victims.We will start by talking about the cast and acting. For the most part the acting is solid, or at least as solid as a campy 80's, low budget, slasher movies acting should be. The main characters throughout do a good job of seeming either dunk, scared, or just plain stupid. Of course some of the supporting casts acting wasn't quite up to par, but it never hurts the film, a movie of this breed should have a certain cheesiness to it, it can't be taken too seriously the entire time. Art the Clown is played by David Howard Thornton and not enough can be said about how amazing he is with the role. He perfectly captures the creepiness that Art has, his facial expressions at times make it hard to even look at him, especially if you suffer from coulrophobia, more about the clown later though.The gore in this movie is so much fun, it's not ultra-realistic, but it is just a fun time to watch, it's the cheesy type of gore that cult horror movies of the 80's were known for, squirting blood, decapitations, etc. If you are into these types of movies than you will love it, if you are overly critical and unrealistic than you won't enjoy these effects. In the age of CGI I love seeing these practical special effects, it really does flash me back to the glory days of Tom Savini and Rob Bottin. I don't know what the budget on this movie was but I'm sure it wasn't high, so personally I think the special effects crew did an amazing job of bringing the gore to life. With all that about the effects being said I will mention that the kill scenes in Terrifier are absolutely awesome, they aren't anything we haven't heard or seen before, but watching Art carry out these depraved, disgusting deaths is pretty astounding. There are a few kills that aren't only done well from a technical point of view but are honestly pretty brutal and not for the squeamish, it's nice to see an independent film maker in the U.S. bringing his form of extreme to the viewers, it's something you see a lot of in other countries, but in the States not so much.The score of the film is good and really helps build the suspense, the editing is great, the only mark down I have for Terrifier is the writing. It's nothing big and I don't mind it but I just noticed that the final half hour or so seemed a little choppy in terms of plot and storyline, but it's the closing sequences we get some of our best kills and most intense scenes with our antagonist Art. Having those exciting moments with at the end help the writing and think if we see more Terrifier films from Damien Leone the flow of the conclusion will be better.Now finally to the one thing that I wanted to talk about the most. Art the Clown. The name of the film captures what Art is, terrifying. Every moment he is on the screen he is captivating, one thing that I think works for him is that you truly don't know what he is going to do next, Art is the most unpredictable movie slasher that the horror community has ever seen. If you have seen All Hallows Eve or this movie than you will know that Art is much more than just a man in a costume, I won't dip into any spoilers in Terrifier but even in All Hallows Eve, Art defies logic constantly by showing up in places that he couldn't possibly be. It's like all the things that we criticize other slashers for like always catching their victims but only walking, being invincible, being resurrected, are all things that Art gets a pass on and the reason for that is simple, Art is cloaked in mystery. We have no clue who (or what) he is, where he comes from, how old he is, nothing, we literally know absolutely nothing about this character. That lack of back story is what makes him so compelling and scary. I hope for Art's sake we never learn anything about him because whatever explanation Damien Leone could give us wouldn't be enough to satisfy the fans. That's my advice, keep the mystery! Art for me is the scariest clown I've ever seen, he beats the likes of both 1990, and 2017 Pennywise, this is high praise and he deserves is. I hope that Art will eventually become a mainstream horror icon to the likes of Freddy and Jason, I think he could be the revival of the 80's horror sequel craze, I would love to see 3 or 4 more movies with Art as our focal point.Terrifier is an extremely fun, gory, 80's throwback. It's the perfect example of the direction that I want to see horror go, the idea of a killer clown isn't original by any means, but if you take your own spin on it, and execute it with your own style it could be done a million times and never get old! All the independent horror film makers need to watch Terrifier, take notes, and follow in the footsteps of Mr. Leone and the crew of Terrifier. It's not easy to make a movie and get it seen by viewers but the marketing and the select theater approach of Terrifier seems to have worked quite well, also the cover art is awesome and looks fantastic in any collectors collection. I would recommend this movie to both horror and non-horror fans alike, I think it has aspects that need to be seen in today's word especially by younger horror fans, so that they know what true horror is all about. Final score 9/10."
" Twisted fun
",0.5106,-0.913,2018-04-01 00:00:00,7,"This was a creepy one, but not on a deep level. It was macabre in a fun sense. While certain parts of the movie were very unique, the chase scenes and fight scenes were predictable. The characters were a step above the usual drunk girls and jock guys we see in these types of movies. Two drunk girls in costumes are ready to go home after a night out on Halloween. One is quieter and the other is more annoying, funny in an obnoxious way. I enjoyed both of them as well as the other secondary characters. Overall, I don't really find Art the Clown terrifying, more just entertaining to watch. I didn't feel that deep sense of dread that comes from deeper character development, which we didn't get enough of here. But the characters are refreshing at times with their dialogue, and the acting is great. Unfortunately, they're all a little too helpless and that is frustrating. It also caused me to lose interest during times when they were in peril. The violence was over the top, but it wasn't cheap. It was gritty, bloody, and quite inventive. I wish the story had more heart. I could have really gotten on board with a smart heroine who was an actual adversary for such a demented villain. But for what it is, this is a respectable horror with it's very own vibe that stands out from the others in the genre."
" Like watching hide & seek for 90 mins; tedious & a bit dull
",-0.2263,-0.854,2018-04-01 00:00:00,4,"This film really needed a PLOT. And characters, some people to root for. Instead, the poor pacing, lack of tension and suspense made for a kind of dull film experience. Yes, Art is a crazy, vicious clown killer. If that's all you want, then you'll see it here as he wounds, kills and dismembers people. The problem is, he will injure someone--a woman's ankle is almost torn out--and the next scene, she's running. People have their heads bashed in...and later, are able to get up and function. It really doesn't make a lot of sense and since Art seems to pop up in more places than possible, he's never really a surprise--he's overused. Clearly the director knew the story was thin, so every few minutes, Art pops up to attack someone. It really is disappointing since the short films showed some potential but when a whole film is given to Art, he's boring and predictable. I'm sure there will be another one--I hope the screenplay is given as much attention as the gore effects."

" How to use a hacksaw
",0.0,-0.8904,2018-03-31 00:00:00,7,"Art the clown from All Hallows Eve is back, this time more evil and maniacal than ever before. David Howard Thornton creates a monster so horrific, so diabolical, he makes Freddy, Jason and Michael look like the three little pigs!
This film will go down in history for the ""hacksaw scene"". It's so nasty even MY stomach did a slight heave!
The acting here is really good. The practical make-up and gore effects are outstanding and the action doesn't stop. But the star of the show here is Art the clown as he chases and kills and disfigures. 
No explanation is given for who he is or where he comes from, but at the end of this film you realize that he is way more than you have been lead to believe."

" Art The Clown -- Making Both Pennywise's Look Like The Biggest Wussies On Your Block
",-0.1027,-0.9893,2018-03-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not for everyone -- and that should become very obvious, very quickly. But for Hardcore Horror fans, it's what you've been waiting Decades for. Not only is it the Goriest of the Gory homages to classic Slashers of the late-70's, early 80's, it will likely enjoy a following all its own...and Soon. I don't want to give too much away, but Art the Clown is quite simply The Last Killer on Earth you would ever want to run into...and this includes Leatherface, Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger, and yes, BOTH Pennywise's. He has no regard and could care less what you think of his various violent methods of dismemberment. This is the first horror film in 15 or more years that actually, genuinely scared me. 
So much so, that I strongly suggest it be watched it in a Large group of people; not only for the Event of it, but for basic, human companionship. Trust me, you'll need it.And I don't go around giving many movies a 10 out of 10; in fact I frown upon it. But you could look for years (literal DECADES), and not find a bigger achievement for a single genre. I really believe that it will solidify itself as a Modern-Day Horror Classic. And we haven't had one of those since Scream in the 90's. And Ghostface? Please! He wouldn't stand a chance. GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND SPREAD THE WORD to other serious horror fans. We all need a sequel (like 8-12 of 'em, minimum). I want to know Everything about Art (okay, maybe not everything -- definitely not everything!). But clearly, there's a backstory here. And if you don't like pure, unadulterated, unabashed Gore, Mayhem, and Carnage -- make other plans."
" Wasted opportunity....
",-0.4939,-0.9814,2018-03-30 00:00:00,5,"Off to the good stuff first.
* The killer clown is the creepiest and scariest i have ever seen.
* Considering its budget, the cinematography, gore, effects and make up are outstanding.
* The killings are amazingly enjoyable. In this part the movie does not hold back!
* It starts out very promising.Now for the bad stuff:
* They kill the main actress at the half of the movie. So.... there is no one really to care about.
* The killer clown could have EASILY been killed AT LEAST 5 times during the movie. Once you realize the pattern as a viewer (the clown hurts the victim, victim fights back, knocks off the clown, runs away, the clown re-hunts the victim), it becomes extremely boring and predictable.
* They put supernatural stuff crap at the end of the movie, so the clown can be resurrected at any time, hoping the producers to have an easy sequel excuse. The worst thing of the movie is the ""pattern"" as i mentioned. I ruins a movie that had the potential of becoming a cult classic."
" A Real Horror Treat
",-0.25,-0.9381,2018-03-30 00:00:00,6,Finally we have a horror that kicks ass on almost all levels. Right from frame one you see how sick this one is going to be and how awesome.Done as a throwback horror we follow a sadistic mime (the dude from All Hallows' Eve) who likes to give people vile deaths. The gore is top shelf as well as the score. This director doesn't hold back on anything. When he colours he really goes outside the lines which makes it rock that much more. For a good tense and twisted time check this one out. If you're a horror fan this will be one of your new favourites.
" Finally genuine horror

Terrifier brought my fear of clowns to a new level, without hearing Art the Clown, I found him incredibly intimidating, and more terrifying then even Pennywise or CLOWN. He's a charming murdering psycho which kept me interested and even scared! I loved how Art has charm to make even the most scared watchers, smile! 
 I look forward to more incredible films with legit fear factors, from Damien & his wild mind. I hope David Howard Thornton is on board as well with his beautiful work of bringing Art the Clown to life! Bring it on, Guys!!! We are all ready to take this journey with yous!!"

" Has its flaws but still one of the creepiest killer clown movies out there
",-0.7876,-0.9975,2018-03-29 00:00:00,9,"This obviously low budget killer clown flick had me in two minds. Finding out it was a re-imagining of the horror short or the same name, that eventually found its way into the horror anthology film ""All hallows eve"" kind of put me off. I saw that film a while ago and although Art the clown was a terrifying clown to look at, the film itself did nothing for me. Then after reading all the reviews on here, most of them completely glowing I was even more sceptical. Most low budget films on here are riddled with 10 star reviews from the crew and cast members so it's hard to trust reviews from people who have written ONE glowing review on a new movie.However, this film deserves all the plaudits it is getting if you are looking for a gruesome, un-nerving and downright bonkers horror film. Makes Pennywise look like Krusty was one of the comments I read, yeah right, then I watched it and was like, ok, so it actually makes Pennywise look like one of the Grumbleweeds, nevermind Krusty.Art the clown is freakin terrifying in this, I don't know who the guy playing him is, I've never heard of him before but he deserves so much credit for bringing this evil beast to life. He is so creepy and brutal, it's difficult to watch at times and the death scenes in this film make Saw and Hostel look tame.Yes it's not perfect by any means, the acting from some of the side characters could have been better (the main cast are fine) and one of the female victims in the second half of the film does some really stupid things that got on my nerves a bit and it is one of those films where (this always annoys me with horror movies) several victims have the villain at their mercy, lying on the ground while they are standing up holding a weapon, and what do they do? They run away and leave the villain to get back up again, really? You've just seen this clown brutally murder your friend and has attempted to murder you, you have him lying on the ground, completely at your mercy and what do you do? Finish him off and then make your escape? Nope, you leave him breathing, discard your weapon and run away, it's cliché and tired.However, people who watch films like this generally come for the atmosphere, the scares and the gore and in that department, Terrifier delivers in spades. everything reeks of the 80's despite it being set in modern times from the way its filmed, the music, the camera work etc but it really does have to be one of the most brutal, unforgiving and absolutely relentless horror films I've ever watched.Art the clown is great and is easily one of the most memorable movie monsters I've seen, despite the fact he never speaks or makes a noise, his screen presence is immense.
There is no CGI in this film and all the special effects are done practical and they look great, it shy's away from nothing and the effects look as realistic as they could have done. The effects team put a lot of effort in here.If you're one of those people who watch movies and pick holes in them, then you might not enjoy this as there are holes to pick at and if you don't enjoy torture porn like Saw and Hostel, again, avoid, but if like me, you like good slasher films, brutality in all its glory and a film that makes you squirm in your seat, then chances are, you're gonna love this.Low budget, lovingly made for its target audience, brutal, creepy and an absolute blast of a horror film.8/12 10"
" Where the Clown Wants Your Guts
",0.0,-0.7237,2018-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Ashy, slashy, trashy, gory - a good bloody nostalgia for all lovers of blood 'n' guts, in its best moments it shines like all those gore classics of the 70s and 80s (even the gore effects look like taken right out from 70s zombie movies or Evil Dead etc.).What to expect: violence, blood, torture, total war. What not to expect: sophisticated storytelling, well written dialogues, acting meant for an Oscar nomination.Recommended - but only for the aficionado of movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre etc. - but this one got a clown on full terror mode. Fine B-Horror. Refreshing."
" Total Crap!
",-0.4389,0.5861,2018-03-29 00:00:00,2,"What a waste. The movie starts out pretty good, with decent cinematography but quickly turns into a tedious bore. The killer clown is eerie at first but then it becomes apparent he's gonna be another Jason or Michael Myers, meaning you can't kill him no matter what you do. However, where the filmmakers really screwed up is by (SPOILER ALERT!). killing off the best character in the movie by far, Tara, the dark haired girl. I thought that the actress was very good and sympathetic and by killing her off in the first half it just wrecked it. We had no one else to care about.. After that all you have is super clown killing everybody. Some of the reviews make you think that you're seeing another great horror classic but I don't think so. A lot of work went into the gore effects but I wish they would have spent as much time on the story. It really goes bad in the second half and I was happy to see it end."

I really liked Art the Clown in All Hallows Eve, but this one amps it up in quality, acting, and gore. Visually awesome and such and 80s slasher feel! I was so pleasantly surprised! I expected to like it, but I loved it! Jenna Kanell is absolutely gorgeous, and I hope that Damien Leone directs so many more films! He's got a huge future in Horror!I'd say it's Not for the squeamish, but why would the squeamish be here anyhow? The gore and the atmosphere are Amazing! A+"

If you like gore, a little bit of nudity and a killer clown that kind off pulls of crazy without saying a word then this could be for you. Don't expect a Spielberg plot though. Better than the wonky cam, let's run through the woods movies."
" TERRIFIER brings HORROR back!

The aesthetic of Art in AHE made me wanting more which is why I enjoyed this movie so much and boy oh boy did we get more!!For those of you NOT into gore, guts, and nudity-this movie isn't for you. But for my fellow horror fans that grew up on 80s horror flick gore, you better add this to your watch list!!! It is FULL OF IT!From watching horrible (I emphasize horrible haha) deaths to TERRIFYING Art The Clown encounters, this movie did hit home for me. There was not a moment I was bored...seriously. From the art direction to the costumes, I give it 10 stars.We experience more of the iconic underground character and the team behind this movie have made it clear how scary Art actually is.I highly recommend this to any horror slasher gore lover. Don't say I didn't warn you-Art's diner scene is quite memorable and stays with you, at least it has stayed with me!Bravo work here.-DisneyMonster (Rylan)"
" Probably the best clown slasher, ever...
",0.6369,0.9884,2018-03-28 00:00:00,9,"It really is better than any other clown movie. I hate clown movies, not because they''re scary, but because they're crap. This isn't. From the opening 30 seconds, you know you are in for something special and genuinely creative. All the actors are solid, the script is actually reasonable, the stock used is the same like in the Aviator, and it really works with non-stop hyper-realistic blood and gore, the clown is actually scary and a strangely interesting character despite being mute, the deaths are creative and ""Uggh"" initiating throughout, the score is suitably atmospheric, lighting and direction are perfect and the pace is high throughout the movie. I don't know what else you want me to say - it really is one of the best slasher movies ever, best clown movies ever and best horror flicks for a ****ing age - there are literally no bits where anything has been skimped on. I don't have anything to do with the production, I know I seem to be brown nosing a lot - but anyone with a slight inclination towards horror in general has to be impressed. This is not hyperbole. Its just a - quite literally - bloody good movie!"
" Clown-sploitation at its finest!
",0.0,-0.7418,2018-03-28 00:00:00,10,"TERRIFIER is a merciless, unforgiving, and filthy example of a perfect clown-sploitation movie.From beginning to end your attention will be rapt by the mesmerizing tension that borders on camp and absurd. For the most part, Art the Clown is a breath of fresh air in a genre that is rife with lack of originality and iconocism. Art is a new breed of slasher -- one that movie goers will quickly fall in love with like they have Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees. I dare say that Art the Clown is the new face of horror!The effects and the kills in this movie are brutal, disgusting, and soothe the appetite of horror fans who can't get enough blood. Art the Clown proves just how menacing and evil he truly is.""Terrifier"" is a movie for the horror fan who loves (or hates) clowns, and should be approached as a film and story that will entertain as well as disgust. With a hint of grindhouse, ""Terrifier"" will immediately become a part of any horror fan's Top 10 list of all time favorite cult films. This movie commands a fandom unlike any we've seen in decades!"
" Savage
",-0.4588,-0.9748,2018-03-27 00:00:00,4,"""Terrifier"" is a continuation of the story of Art the Clown and his evil doings on Halloween. I will say this: this clown not only looks scary, but is one sick, twisted individual! He is out to do harm to anybody that gets in his way. It seems once he lays eyes on you, there is no escape. This movie also does not skimp on the gore. There are two kills that are as graphic as anything I've ever seen. In fact, it went a little overboard for my tastes. I'm sure the gore hounds will love it, though. To each his own, I suppose. Unrated but this is not a movie for children, so parents be WARNED. This film contains savage violence, language, and nudity."
" The Terrifier is The Tormentor!
",0.0,-0.8578,2017-10-28 00:00:00,7,I watched the horror film Terrifier tonight and here is my review for the movie that shall contain some minor spoilers throughout.The movie is based around Art the black and white clown who is even more deadly than he is serious.During a Halloween night out two friends Dawn and Tara decide to go for something to eat and whilst doing so see a strange and creepy looking clown along the way.The situation changes when Tara needs help from her sister Victoria and then things rapidly go from fun to chaotic and it is then that people are going to be affected in a selection of different scenarios and many vicious and even crude ways! I did like that there was an evolution in many ways of Art the clown coming from the short film Terrifier in 2011. This feature length film delivers in many departments for horror fans from extreme violence and blood to comedy and atmospheric music.Terrifier does attempt to be like many other post modern horror films with certain references however it does add some things that make it stand out from other more recent films whilst still managing to keep you engaged and entertained.I would rate the Terrifier 7 out of 10!
