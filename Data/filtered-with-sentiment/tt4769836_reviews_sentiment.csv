" Very funny, solid plot
",0.6214,0.0258,2021-04-04 00:00:00,9,"With Hollywood abandoning actual comedy in lieu of socialist messaging, this is a breath of fresh air. Negative reviewers are mad this is politically incorrect and actually funny. Spade and Sandler deliver many funny moments."
" Ouch
",0.0,0.1779,2021-02-24 00:00:00,2,It's like the creators made a list of how many desperate shock-value things in existence they could make fun of and their goal was to check every single box. Absolutely an eye-roll and waste of time.
" in the end, thumbs down
",0.0,0.381,2021-02-22 00:00:00,3,"I was in the mood for a good comedy and as I'm starting to become partial to Adam Sandler (something I thought would never happen) I decide to give this a shot.As many have said, it started out with great promise. However, as it began to wrap up, it became a ""message"" film, with the usual anti-business, Big Bad Pharma theme. At this point the humor evaporated. I wanted comedy, not social meaning.I also have ambivalent feelings about the sexual humor. It is well-known that this is a central feature of Sandler's movies, but in this flick the sexual humor was so over the top, so outrageous, so in-your-face that I couldn't decide whether the writers were lampooning our culture's obsession with sex or exploiting it.In the end I think there are better ways to spend a couple of hours."
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.9272,2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,"This day and age I don't watch a lot of comedies anymore because most of them are just liberal trash.However, I was surprised this movie was quite good and kept my attention the whole time.Good plot and acting was mostly good. I grew up watching Tommy boy, billy Madison, happy Gilmore, black sheep, mr deeds and joe dirt. This movie felt original and not new age whatsoever"
" nothing to spoil
",0.0,0.4588,2020-12-10 00:00:00,4,A boring and very predictable movie with no original humour.The best that can be said is that there is a minimum of Sandler's usual corny schtick.
" I will never be able to unsee this film
",0.0,0.4482,2020-10-22 00:00:00,1,"Started watching this film on netflix as I've always found Adam Sandler to be slightly amusing. Let me save any interested prospective viewers the pain of what I've just gone through watching this horrible game excuse for a film. It is not a film, it is pre-pubescent:adolescent shlock. There is one scene in this film about 1/2 way through that I will never be able to unsee, and I'm haunted by it. David Spade & Luis Guzman have a threesome with a woman and the camera captures Luis Guzman's ass and testicles from behind Luis Guzman while he gets pleasured by the woman in front of him. I ask: why was this specific scene even necessary to forward the narrative? And funnily enough, the film is rated MA? Do yourself a favour, don't watch it. I turned off after this scene"
" Can never go full Magnum
",0.0,0.9933,2020-10-15 00:00:00,6,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the comedy The Do Over (2015) where the Sandman and David Spade play two old high school friends who catch up again during a high school reunion. Spade lives an unfulfilling life, with a dead end job and a crap marriage. Both characters decide to have a fresh start by faking their own deaths and starting over with new identities. They both find out their new identities may be even more troublesome. Both actors have great chemistry and their comedic timing is on point. This film is Sandler doing Sandler, but it's the great Sandler like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore days. This movie unexpectedly has quite a few laughs along with great life messages including life itself is too short and this movie delivers that message with a punch. You have great and surprising cameos from Catherine Bell, the Jag lady and Luiz Guzman, the shooter boy. You have plenty of dick and fart jokes, but they are more funny and less tasteless than I have seen in recently. The plot is as always silly but it a Sandler film. The concept of cancer treatment however is smart and sad at the same considering how many lives could be saved if it wasn't all about the money. The funny scenes include the three-way etiquette and the snake-delivery. Overall a funny flick 6/10"
" Better Than Most People Expected!

" Not Bad
",0.431,0.8183,2020-08-05 00:00:00,5,"Adam Sandler and David Spade star in this 2016 action-comedy.
Spade plays Charlie, a mild-mannered guy who is tired of his same
routine. Soon, he reunites with his old pal from school, Max who decides to
change both their identities and have fun. They both get more than they bargain for and Charlie learns more about Max along the way. This isn't bad, Sandler & Spade are good together, there's funny and a few nasty moments. Paula Patton, Kathryn Hahn, Catherine Bell and Sandler's wife, Jackie also appear. Give this one a try if you're into buddy flicks."

NO need for the level of gross 16 year old humor, actual violence in this movie?! So disrespectful to women in general and really irritating in the way it was presented as women just being objectified.
We should be way beyond this level of disgusting ""jokes"" in 2020. Sandler and Spade ... who I have enjoyed in the past, should simply be embarrassed by this one!!"

" Nice Story, not funny
",0.1012,0.9042,2020-05-29 00:00:00,5,The plot is very intriguing and the I love Sandler and Spades performance but the the sexual content in this film was too much for my liking. If there wasnt the explicit content or at least a lower limit that this film reached then I would have given it a 7 and put in my bag of good Sandler movies. The twist is a good pay off but i feel that this story is waisted and the concepts wont be seen by general audiences or revisited by those with a low tolerance to explicit content
" go on max kessler!
",0.0,0.9292,2020-05-24 00:00:00,5,"I usually like the movies of Adam Sandler. In general, his films are kinda like silly funny and entertaining and if you have any spare time, they make you laugh in somehow.So, i would like to say about this particular movie is that it isn't typical films of Adam Sandler. I mean, it isn't just a goofy comedy. Even if it outweighs way more in comedy sense, it isn't just about it all. It has actually have a plot and tells a story. And that's what i like about it."
" Woah, surprisingly good.
",0.6249,0.9311,2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,"It's is a mindless dark humor comedy. The plot is thriller alike, which made it even more entertaining, the majority of jokes were perverted, so you have to be in the right mood. Personally I really enjoyed this movie, it was pure mindless fun, I laughed a lot and had a great time watching it."
" Better than his most recent efforts, but Sandler's The Do-Over is hardly enjoyable
",0.6554,0.7046,2020-03-25 00:00:00,4,"Although it may be much better than Sandler's more recent comedic efforts, The Do-Over suffers from an identity crisis of its own by not being able to stick with one plotline throughout its overly long course. Sandler and Spade star as the leads, and neither give very impressive performances. The film starts out surprisingly well, with it being enjoyable, although not terribly so. As the film goes on however, it seems to have no idea how to connect the pieces of its own plotline and scatters to do it throughout a nearly 2 hour course. Quite fast, the film seems to lose whatever steam it had going for it, and the jokes seem too on the nose or simply too childish to be funny anymore. The acting goes from okay, to simply bad, with Paula Patton providing the best of the performances. The music seems really forced, and the dialogue even more so. It's better than you would expect for a Sandler film today, but it's disappointing, because somewhere in the mist of sloppy writing and gross-out jokes, there is a genuinely fine movie. But simply, the result is too much too fast, and too little too slow, never amounting to much of anything satisfying throughout its long run.
My Rating: 4/10"
" absolute over the top rubbish
",0.2023,0.8945,2020-03-14 00:00:00,1,"I actually only watched this film after reading the mostly positive feedback. Big mistake. Whoever calls this film comedy doesn't know what comedy is. The content in gratuitous violence and sex combined with some SM and a more then none sensical story makes it indigestible to any audience. I was massively disappointed, but then the US film industry seem to have to go over the top in every respect. Normally I find something which would merit some positive comment. Not in this case. Complete waste of time."

It's a 22 on metacritic (as of this writing).But if you want a silly, often low-brow, Sandler movie, it's far better than that metacritic aggregate. My wife and I enjoyed it alongside a drink on a Saturday night.Not a 10/10, but certainly not a 2/10. It was fun, silly nonsense and a movie we enjoyed for exactly what it was.

" Solid 6

No. It's a buddy action / comedy featuring Adam Sandler and David Spade, if you were expecting more, that's on you.It's stupid, it's full of dick jokes, trashy action sequences, unbelievable plot, and two grown men acting like frat boys - and that's funny. If it was real, it probably wouldn't be, but it's not, it's a silly movie that's designed to be nothing but mindless entertainment; no philosophical questions, no moral, no lasting implications. If you don't find that funny, then why are you here?It's well shot, good to look at, the chemistry between the two leads works, and it's not trying to be more than it is. If you like this type of movie and you've got a spare bit of time just watch it, might as well."

I decided to go back and give this one a go, since i have been avoiding his past few years efforts.
I also assumed his teaming with David Spade would produce better results, and i wasnt dissapointed on that note.
The casting of both characters really work together perfectly for their styles, and allowed both of them to do what they do best..which means going back to the original blue-print of Sandler style entertainment..

",0.3612,0.8675,2019-04-25 00:00:00,7,Been in a Sandler binge of late and have to say I've not been too disappointed although I prefer Sandler playing the underdog schmuck roles he usually plays. Still this film has plenty of laughs (which is why we watch a Sandler film) and is just great mindless fun.Fun fact: The blonde German hitman is the same guy from The Big Lebowski in an identical role.
" I WILL Be Doing It Over MANY Times!
",0.0,0.9984,2019-03-01 00:00:00,9,"Typically I love Adam Sandler movies, though there have been a few that just sort of drag and aren't as funny or interesting in this movie does not fit in that category, this movie is not only hilarious but it has a great plot, a stellar cast, gorgeous locations, and surprises along the way! When I first started seeing the advertisements for this movie I really wasn't digging it, especially for the fact that it had David Spade in it because now that David Spade is got this whole mustache attempting to do Geek Chic look thing going on, he's changed his comedy to be even more dry then it was in the past and even in the past is comedy at times was hard to sit through even though I loved most of it he can be so dry that it's boring even! So when I saw the two of them teaming up in a movie it was hard to be excited with David Spade pulling this geeky look because I knew he was going to play it up for what it was worth. I found it on Netflix and decided to give it a chance tonight and I was very glad that I did! I'm not sure if Adam Sandler wrote this in addition to the other hats that he has worn but hats off to the writer because there were so many surprises woven in to the storyline some good some heartbreaking and a lot of times when people write surprises into a storyline they just can't pull it off because they just throw it in there instead of trying to make it logical and plausible but that is certainly not the case here! Two old high school Buddies meeting up at their reunion, the one seeing his own need and his old best friends need and taking the reins to try to help him out to make a major life change sets them off on a major Adventure of international proportions! Adam Sandler plays a dashing hero who is sort of a man of mystery and many talents, and David Spade playing a man who was so stuck in a rut that he was literally living in the house he grew up in, still driving the first car he ever had, married to the high school head cheerleader who was cheating on him with her first husband and her kids that he was taking care of treated him like crap and he's even still working the same job he worked in high school! The rest is up to you I don't want to ruin it for you but truly Life Changes are made and Adventures are had & the movie it's great to watch! Laughs are had an entertainment value is high!"

" Decent Return to Form for Sandler
",0.0,0.9898,2018-07-09 00:00:00,7,"I personally like the movie. I thought it had a great plot, plenty of funny moments, and a nice twist ending that was both believable and well-crafted.Sandler and Spade are Max and Charlie, two guys who fake their deaths to escape boring lives. They then take over the identities of two recently deceased men. This leads them to a life of luxury as the dead men had money and a lease on a getaway home in Puerto Rico all kept in a safety deposit box. Unfortunately, the men didn't die from natural causes and suddenly groups of hit men start trying to kill Max and Charlie. Beautiful Paula Patton is the wife of one of the deceased men and joins the two to help them solve her husband's murder. That plot has been overdone in the movies, but its handled pretty well here. The jokes are less sophomoric than most Sandler films (but, yes, he gets in a few crude bathroom jokes and an over-the-top, cringe-worthy torture scene. Still, compared to some of his other movies recently, this is a winner.The supporting cast are hit and miss. Michael Chiklis and Catherine Bell play neighbors in Puerto Rico. Ms. Bell still looks amazing, but she's had some work done on her lips and that was distracting. The always reliable Katherine Hahn as Sandler's ex-girlfriend is a treat (she keeps popping up to kill him like Carrie Fisher in the Blues Brothers). Nick Swardson tones it down a lot as a mysterious stalker in a black suit. Luis Guzman is utterly wasted. Torsten Voges is both creepy and wildly hilarious as a hitman on their trail.Again, this is a much better Sandler movie than some of his recent work. Mostly because he toned down the moron aspect of his characters and actually tries to play it straight, allowing the plot to be the humor, not his antics. Spade is playing the same character he plays in all his movies, but he still does it well. If they had dropped the toilet humor from the story, it would have made for a more taught, engaging movie. Still, I enjoyed it immensely and it was good to see Sandler back in form."

The main thing I wonder after watching this garbage is that a group of people spent time and money to make it, than they sat and watched their creation and probably said ""yeah, good job everyone, that's a great movie, people would surely enjoy it""
I was never an Adam Sandler fan, but some of his movies are not completely terrible, some I even liked, but I have no idea what is this thing that I just watched.
Do yourself a favor and do something else with your time, anything but watch this 
very predicted, poorly made and sadly embarrassing movie."
" Enjoyable
",0.4404,0.9923,2018-01-18 00:00:00,8,Didn't have great expectations - but they were exceeded. Thought Sandler struck a good balance between his earlier goofy comedies that catapulted his career and what would make sense for someone in their 50s. Spade was solid - primarily because he stayed in his narrow range and its always fun to see Matt Walsh. The Gymnast was fabulous and probably the best character - well except for Catherine Bell who just refuses to age.I watched the movie over 3 treadmill/stationary bike sessions and have to say it made the workouts actually enjoyable. A comedy is effective if it leaves you in a good mood and this one accomplished that goal.
" Finders Keepers lose your sneakers

" Who knew Adam Sandler is able to surprise yet?
",0.2732,0.9958,2017-09-02 00:00:00,6,"Two down-on-their-luck guys (Adam Sandler, David Spade) fake their own deaths and start over with new identities, only to find the people they're pretending to be are in even deeper trouble. Also playing, Paula Patton, Kathryn Hahn, Nick Swardson, Luis Guzmán, Michael Chiklis, Torsten Voges, Stan Ellsworth and the others. A curiously unusual comedy for Sandler, but not in a bad way like Sandy Wexler"". It has its fair share of dirty jokes but relies even more on unexpected turns, absurdist and black humor, and action. Oh yeah, if there ever was Sandler action movie, this is it. Watching the man in this new mode is kind of exciting. He's not a born action star but he's not actually that bad either. At least it makes his character more intriguing than usual. He feels unpredictable – you can't figure out whether he is more of a bad or good guy here. Spade is a great sidekick as always, which is probably why most of his roles happen in Sandler's movies these days. But he feels so bland by himself that it's difficult to imagine him starring anywhere again. Some of Sandler's regulars are here – Swardson, Guzmán, Spade – but the more colorful smaller appearances belong to Stan Ellsworth as Dakota and Torsten Voges as the Gymnast. The screenplay is weak as usual, more like a loosely tied bunch of sketches, but this is one of those times where it more or less works for the result's favor. It helps to give The Do-Over"" this rare tone where you can't predict where the story's heading more of the time. It's rare for Sandler's comedy at least. If there were only less twists in the final third, they get a bit exhausing All in all, I enjoyed it more than many recent Sandler comedies, at least ones from this decade. Looking bad, now it's kind of surprising that he has never tried to do action before. The result isn surprisingly watchable. Not that I would like to see him do this kind of stuff all the time. To-Do List"" is the second out of Sandler's four-movie deal with Netflix, 2015's The Ridiculous 6"" being the first and this year's Sandy Wexler"" being the third. Let's wait for 2018's ""The Week Of"" now..."

",-0.4588,-0.8911,2017-07-22 00:00:00,1,I hate Adam Sandler's movies. I had some spare hours to kill. Put the movie on...after a short period of time my fears were realised. Paused the movie. Went to make some soup. Put the movie on. Had my soup while the movie played in the background. Each scene was predictable. I thought slapstick went out with Charlie Chaplin. Same old style. URGH! Don't want to say more. My fingers are bleeding!
" Entertaining movie
",0.4404,0.9954,2017-06-19 00:00:00,7,"I'm not a critic, so I won't pretend to be one. I just wanted to add a good review to this site because I didn't think it was a bad movie. Was is Sandler's best, no. But was it good, yes. The acting was good, had a decent plot, and what I felt was a decent ending. It kept my interest and made me laugh. I watch a movie to be entertained and escape from the real world for a couple of hours. It did that and that's what made it good for me. If you're watching for Sandler in hopes of seeing another Billy Madison, The Waterboy, or even The Longest Yard (3 of my favs), look to re-watching those movies because this isn't it. I started watching the movie not to see old Sandler comedy, but just to see Sandler, and Spade, and I wasn't disappointed. The comedy is a bit raunchy, but funny. So, without spoiling, be prepared. Just watch it and have fun like I did."
" Sandler's Best Since ""Billy Madison""
",0.6369,0.9899,2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"It is rare that I watch a comedy, with so many good dramas on T.V, but I was interested to see what Sandler, a childhood favorite actor, was up to. After watching movies that just weren't that funny, (everything since Billy Madison aside from Zohan) I was skeptical. However, after watching the film it would seem that Sandler and Spade are a comedy duo that fits together perfectly.It was a nice role reversal to see Sandler play the brains of the operation, while Spade played his usual unsuspecting goofball. There were multiple times where I couldn't help myself but to laugh out loud. It is nice to see Sandler target a more adult audience, with some of the crude humor, and re-engage the fans that started watching him when he started out. It is also nice because the film actually has a decent plot, I won't give it away. I will conclude by saying that if you have ever enjoyed any of Sandler's films, and don't mind crude humor, than you will more than likely enjoy this film. I hope that Sandler and Spade team up again to either reprise their roles, or start another new adventure together."
" Above average Sandler
",0.0,-0.35,2017-03-31 00:00:00,7,"Kind of has that classic Sandler feel.If you are expecting a deep, twisting plot or Shakespearian acting you are looking in the wrong spot. If you are looking for something to smile over and give a chuckle or two...well you found it.Down to it.Acting- as expected from Spade and Sandler. Amusing.Scripting- fun but obviously not especially deep.Plot- simplistic and fun.Directing- well pacedWhile this is not a ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison"" it also isn't one of the stinkers from the last few years.Good way to spend a couple hours."
" Best Sandler movie in years!
",0.6696,0.9049,2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"I watched this for a second time as I really enjoyed it the first time. Not only is it funny, it has a deep emotional connection to it as well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of sandlers early movies. Also, I can't say enough good things about David spades acting in this film. His delivery is exceptional and I also think that this film is so good because of him. If you haven't seen this and you are contemplating, there is no question that you should watch it. You will not be disappointed."
" If you like Sandler, you will love this, if you don't, you may like it anyway !
",0.8588,0.9936,2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"I got a Netflix subscription not that long ago and so far i am very pleased by there original content. I always liked Adam Sandler personally even tough i have no problem recognizing his movies have teenage sex humour for the most part. So it was a given i was gonna give this movie a look and honestly, i really liked it !! Not only it has what i like in a Sandler flick but there is also deeper stuff in character development i won't go into to keep this review 100% spoiler free.The story was compelling and you could tell the actors had fun making this movie. They have great chemistry together as well. There is only one character i tough was way over the top, you will recognize him as soon as you see him, but otherwise i liked all the other characters.This is not a perfect movie obviously, and only a fool would hope for such thing when watching an Adam Sandler movie, but if you are a fan of the guy's work and like most of his movies except the worst one, you will definitely enjoy this one. If you are not a fan of Sandler, i would still recommend to check it out, as long as you like comedies and don't mind a bit of trash humour."
" Reborn to face even bigger troubles.
",-0.4588,0.8694,2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"It's true that Sandler had lost his Midas touch, but last few films suggest he's back. Still, he's not the same old what he used to be. The time has changed, so he has to adapt to it and I think he's doing okay. Only haters/film critics keep hating him. This is a Netflix production and Sandler in a mysterious role. He teams up with his old school friend and they fake their deaths to begin a new life. But the identities they have borrowed ones are even in the bigger troubles which begins to haunt them as well. So coming out of it is the remaining film to tell.The storyline seems just okay. Since it is not fresh enough, they did not even overuse the concept to build plot with clichés. Kind of guessable twists, but it will work for most of the people. Better stunt sequences for such a comedy flick. Good performances and it was a smooth sail according to the film's pace. The director and Sandler had given a few good comedies back then, and this fresh collaboration was decent. So don't believe the film critics (Rotten Tomatoes & Metacritic), elsewhere it is rated much better, but still somewhat underrated. If you are seeking a decent action-comedy, this is worth a try.7/10"
" I Like It
",0.3612,0.8524,2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"I have to say that after watching many unfunny movies in 2016, I actually enjoyed this one. There were some moments where I LOL. Ones I remember right now are: - The 3 Sum seen with David Spade - The parts where Nick Swardson gets hit with the car - The part where the Biker guy flirts with Adam Sandler.and many other scenes.I've always been a fan of Adam's movies. Some of them were not as good as I expected, but most of them are well made and funny. As far as i remember, my favorite Adam Sandler's movies are when Rob Schneider is co-starring in them. Those two have chemistry.I give this one 8/10."
" Pretty good comedy
",0.8225,0.9947,2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Not half bad for a Sandler movie. I watched the first hour of it thinking, ""meh this is funny but sorta lame"", then the plot picks up and i found myself enjoying it and intrigued to see what would happen next. Too much male nudity for my taste, but overall not horrible when it comes to content. There were many parts I found funny and the overall plot and story is pretty great. The main actors did a great job and the supporting characters brought a lot of humor. Definitely not a movie you ant the kids to see. But might be good if you want something silly and enjoyable to watch when your bored. FYI: There are 2 or 3 dicks shown in the movie..."
" What Did You Expect?
",0.0,0.4912,2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I should have known better when I saw the Adam Sandler credit; after all, he's made a career out of terrible movies. However, once I started I had to continue out of curiosity, just to see how abysmally awful it was going to be. There's plenty of noise, guns, violence, anal insertions, and more nipples than you'll ever want to see, held together by a plot that may have worked under better hands. Sandler plays a jerk (what else is new?) and Spade his patsy. I found it hard to care what happened to either one of them!Do yourself a favor and find something that requires a few more IQ points!"
