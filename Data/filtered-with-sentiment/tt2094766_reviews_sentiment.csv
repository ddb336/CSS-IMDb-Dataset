" It is what it is, or what it was.
",0.0,0.9792,2021-04-01 00:00:00,9,All I knew about the game is some guy in an ancient hoodie jumps from somewhere high then does ancient parkour.Making a movie from a video game must be like reverse engineering. Coincidentally there is a lot of looking backwards in this movie. But the historical aspects look authentic which is most admirable. The modern stuff has a distinct flair as well. The conviction in the performances and choreography is also top notch.The pitfall is in trying to make an intriguing and atmospheric thriller fit the premise of a video game. This is most apparent in the dialogue which seems watered down to suit young teenagers who might play the video game. Nothing wrong with that only that it's at odds with the maturity in every other aspect of the film.A fun movie based on a video game. It had me hooked from start to finish.

" Not as bad as it the video game movies made before it
",0.431,0.9968,2021-03-21 00:00:00,5,"The way it was being announced sounded really promising. Its trailer was a masterpiece, the fact that it used its original Assassin and original setting instead of milking the popularity of Altair/Ezio, being the highest budget for any video game movie etc. I thought finally this film shall be what changes the video game movie genre once and for all. But it didn't. Here's a list of all the problems I think this movie had.Normally all high budget superhero/gaming movies focus on the regular character more than the character people want to watch. The reason behind this being is that1. People like the character they want to watch, so when the character comes up, they will get pumped up. Obviously they can't be pumped up for an entire movie, so they have to be shown that for a short duration to make it more exciting.2. The character requires more budget. Showing Superman or Iron Man for 2 hours will drain the entire budget of the film, so they have to be shown for a short time.The makers of Assassin's Creed must have also thought of the same, so they did the same. However, they made mistakes in both the parts.1. What the people wanted to watch was not the ancestor, but what the ancestor did. Unlike superhero movies where the alter ego only becomes the superhero in the climax scene, Assassin's Creed is supposed to revolve mainly around the ancestor and not the present day. But it seemed they were trying to ape superhero and other video game movies.2. I don't think too much budget was needed for showing the ancestors, since they didn't use any CGI to show their day to day activities. Sure the background needed it, but they could have easily shown them in fields, buildings, churches and other places where things are pretty much the same.And even when they were focusing on the modern day Assassin, he wasn't doing anything interesting either. He was just murmuring conversations and occasionally acting insane.The movie couldn't even decide who it is for. First they explain obvious things to the audience, like what the Animus is and what the Assassins and Templars do, but then they don't tell us many things we want to know, like why the Apple of Eden is important, what the bleeding effect is or the fact that Cal got desynchronised after performing a Leap of Faith (it looked more like he got injured from the jump). So they bored the fans of the game and confused the ones who haven't played it.The only thing the ancestor was shown doing was assassinating a man while riding a horse cart, and saving himself from being hanged. That's it. They could have shown so many things - How Aguilar was born, how his upbringing was, how he became an Assassin, how he met that woman who died and why he got so emotional when she died, how he ended up getting caught because of which he was being hanged, what was the aftermath after he escaped and gave Columbus the Apple of Eden, and how he knew the Templar in the horse cart.Sure they wanted to make everything original, but it would have been great if they decided to add some veteran characters in the cameos. It would have been more fun to see Shaun and Rebecca helping Cal to get out than that boring prison break scene, or if he got hold of the Apple of Eden and killed everyone around him like how Desmond did it in III (it would have been a great reference).Even the characters already present in it, the discount Warren Vidic could have done stuff like convincing Cal that the Assassins are wrong, by telling the Templar point of view instead of just telling him what Assassin means in Arabic.The Animus they introduced also made it so much more confusing. They could have just made the Animus lift him in the air and keep him still instead of moving around. It made the audience wonder what will happen if he runs straight or performs a leap of faith. And the movie answers both the questions by... (drum rolls)... not answering them!Of course this film is not a complete disaster like how all video game movies before it were. There are a few things I liked about this film.They used their own Assassin. Had they wanted they could have made a crappy Altair origin story or a boring version of Ezio story and milked their popularity. But they took the risk of bringing up a new Assassin, one whom we had never heard of before.The entire trait of the Assassin was limited to this one film. Nothing to be learnt before watching the film, nothing to know afterwards. This movie is completely standalone, unlike high budget cash grabbing movies nowadays which are made only to create a franchise.The film took place in Spain. Until now the Assassin's Creed franchise had covered almost all famous European countries - Britain, France, Italy, Portugal, Russia. By now Greece and Scandinavian countries have also joined. But the elephant in the room, Spain, had still not been addressed, even though it was a great place to show.The visual appeal. Right from where they show a burning Madrid with an eagle flying over it to where Aguilar performs a leap of faith, everything was exciting. I gotta admit, they showed the ancestor very nicely. They should have focused on him more than the modern day.They knew what translates well into the screen and what doesn't. That's the reason why they didn't dive deep into the game mechanics. They just gave an overview to the audience showing what the series is all about, even if they didn't explain things well and stated the obvious. This way it is possible to pave way for a film franchise if they want.They remembered to show a famous personality, keeping the trend intact. Sure he was only there for like, 2 minutes, but at least he was there."
" Trying to do more with less
",0.0,0.8003,2021-03-19 00:00:00,7,"Try squishing a 400 year Creed in between a 1000 year conflict, the historical aspect, the morality, reasons and what not, were really good, the only problem is they had to do more with less which in a 1 and a half hour movie was really hard despite being a video game movie which is expected to flop, they couldve kept the real life action more interesting but they poured it all into the inquisition, Alot of good characters that had the potential to be interesting and likeable, but a movie that short there was only so much they can do, it wasnt as bad as everyone said it was. Honestly."
" No eagle screech
",-0.296,0.4767,2021-02-19 00:00:00,4,Past assassins are the only good part of the film and it makes up 15% film. Like 5 chances to include a decent eagle screech but blunders all of them.
" Assassin's Creed (2016, Justin Kurzel) Ridiculous mess of a video game adaptation
",-0.6124,-0.984,2021-02-16 00:00:00,2,"Assassin's Creed (2016, Justin Kurzel)
This muddled mess of a film continues a long standing of trend of sub-par video game adaptations. The more I think about this movie the more it irritates me. Let's start with a few positives. The look and action of the film are quite well done. The fighting scenes are well choreographed and despite not being a player of the video games I could tell they attempted to adhere to some of the signature game movements such as how the characters attack and jump. The story is beyond ridiculous. It is hokey and illogical and not very well done. I am not sure if the story if lifted from the game but if it was they should have abandoned it. If it wasn't they should have come up with something much more interesting and effective to start what could have been a very lucrative franchise. We start with a man named Cal Lynch played by Michael Fassbender who is being executed. He is not a very good guy and after his ""execution"" we find that he was whisked away by a secret organization to a facility in Spain where he is being repurposed. Apparently there has been a war for ages between the Templar Knights and a secret society of assassins. One of the missions of the Templars has been to find a biblical relic known as the Apple of Eden which contains the seed of man's original sin. Passed the mumbo jumbo this relic is supposed to control free will and back in the era of the Spanish Inquisition the assassins hid the relic. The Templars have been searching for it ever since. Once they control it then they can eradicate free will thus launching the world into an unprecedented era of peace. Everybody besides the assassins are apparently okay with this. What?.. The Templars in the modern day are apparently thriving while the assassin's have forgotten their illustrious past. The primary Templars we get to see are a father daughter combo played by Jeremy Irons and Marion Cotillard. They maintain a research facility and have figured out a way to determine the location of their lost treasure. They put people in basically a historical virtual reality machine called the Animus which allows them to live as their long lost ancestors. They have tracked down the assassin's modern day descendents and have utilized this machine by putting the descendents in it to determine the apple's whereabouts. The last key to the puzzle is the last known assassin who had the bauble, Aguilar, who is Cal Lynch's distant ancestor. As he spends time in the machine it somehow restores this long lost assassin ethos into him and soon he has become what the Templars tried for so long to suppress. This all sounds even more ridiculous and confusing every time I think about it. Not only that for some unknown reason they keep all these modern assassins at the facility yet everyone is shocked when these prisoners finally rise up and fight. The character interactions are nonsensical. It is tough to understand anyone's motivation in the story and the ending is dull and anticlimactic and is even confusing in its attempt to set up a sequel. The only thing of worth in the entire movie are the action and fighting sequences but in these too I would've preferred an R rating so we could have gone more hog wild with the blood so instead we get a movie that is declawed from the get go because the violence has to be tempered. Quite plainly this movie is a disaster from start to finish.

" The ending compromises all the excellent previous story making the movie trivial and silly
",0.5719,-0.9538,2021-02-07 00:00:00,3,"The fight between two factions for an apple lasting for centuries ends with the capture of the apple by a simple infiltration while the apple is exposed during a meeting in order it be easily got by the hostile faction making the movie completely idiot proving the factions fight for no reason, or that the reason is an excuse to fight, indeed the free will is an excuse to fight each other for wrong reasons. It's stupid enough."
" Badly done
",-0.4767,-0.6808,2021-01-27 00:00:00,3,"All the good actors are wasted in this badly executed movie. Cinematography, music, editing... all are far below average. No spoilers here I couldn't finish the movie."
" Like watching a game of chess with pieces missing...
",0.3612,0.9816,2021-01-17 00:00:00,6,"Justin Kurzel did a great job assembling a pretty decent cast list for this derivative adventure, and though it is pretty level-driven and formulaic, it's not the worst action film to be based on a game that I have seen. Michael Fassbender is a convicted murderer who is saved from execution by a company that tells him of his ancient lineage as a Master Assassin, and he is actually quite good as the slightly more cerebral beefcake who uses his new-found skills to avert the modern day Knights Templar from acquiring an apple that controls the genetics of free will. Charlotte Rampling, and to a lesser extent a rather wooden Jeremy Irons, dress and act the part of the pursuing megalomanics well enough and Brendan Gleeson is always to be relied upon with his more monosyllabic roles. There is plenty of action, though as ever we seem to need to learn from our mistakes to progress and the Templar always seem to manage to cock things up, even when the odds and resources are hugely in their favour. The plot is all over the place, and it doesn't help that there is an annoyingly fragmented timeline, so don't look for a logical narrative - just enjoy it for what it is. A technically solid fantasy feature with some impressive visual effects."
" Good action movie with a different take on the whole search for ancient artifacts.
",0.4404,0.8821,2021-01-16 00:00:00,7,"Most movies based on video games struggle, however this one seems to be a decent attempt at making a good movie.The story revolves around a mysterious ancient organisation who have developed technology to access the memories of ones ancestors. They use this in their efforts to obtain an ancient artifact they believe can change the world.I came at this movie with fresh eyes having never played the games. So i had no comparison to original characters, themes and stories. So i can appreciate that there will also be people disappointed by the transition from the source material.With fresh eyes i thought this was a competent well made and enjoyable movie. However, it's not perfect whilst its well acted, has great set piece action and decent effects, it suffers from various plot holes which detract from some of the story telling. I also felts that the memories felt just like that 'memories', there wasn't enough connection between the protagonist and his ancient counterpart and just serves to bookmark various progression of the story, which for some will be satisfactory.In conclusion it is a movie that is well worth a watch and you have no requirement to have played the games previously."
" Where do you start?
",0.0,-0.943,2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Sadly forgot I'd seen this before - or more likely obliterated the memory as too awful to live with. I can only assume it was paying well to get the cast it did. There could be no other reason for having their name associated with this dire mess.
Nothing in this made sense - the motivation of the characters, the pseudo-science, the action. It was all just appearance without purpose.
In case you haven't picked up on it yet, I loathed this from beginning to end."
" Forget it's based on a video game...
",-0.2263,0.9794,2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,"These type of films are always tricky to pull off well (video game to cinema). But genuinely I believe Assassin's Creed is a well made action, religious themed, thriller type film.I think people who have played the game may feel differently, maybe this is a benefit I haven't. But put aside it's based on a video game, watch it for what it is and you shouldn't be disappointed. The visuals are stunning, the action sequences and camera work in some of the parkour style chase scenes is fantastic.The concepts it explores are also interesting about human behaviour, the way religion has effected humanity over the centuries, religious creeds etc. Overall it's a stylish well made film with a quality feel to it and some decent acting from some (not all granted). I was really hoping they would make a sequel.So give it a chance and watch it before you read all the reviews and condemn it. . ."

" Fan of the Game and Sorry
",0.25,0.5201,2020-12-13 00:00:00,4,"I hate to see the directors' turning great games into mediocre movies even with an all-star casting. There is already a great plot with fundamental philosophies in the game but all that changed badly in the movie.Animus is just a bed with some connections which makes sense but this one in the movie is a freak show. He can easily break his spine with using that crazy machine.Ezio, Altair and Desmond are great characters and what is the reason to create a new one? Would you prefer a Tomb Raider movie without Lara Croft? Also the geographic changes are just needless. All the great details from the game are ruined with a new empty fake one.Out of Animus scenes are too long and just boring, we more need to focus on the ancestor character which was perfectly happening in the game. I think only a director who finished the Altair and Ezio sequels with a 100% completion should be directing this movie, it is clear as a whistle that this crew didn't spend enough time with the game. Even in the first scene, they are cutting one finger during the ""Assassin's Ceremony"". If you played the game well you would know that they weren't cutting the finger which is a wrong myth. Instead they are just marking that ring finger with a hot branding iron.There are Templars and Assassins in an eternal war and Templars are connected with the Abstergo. A person who didn't play the games cannot say anything about Templars after watching that movie. I see only 2 times mentioned and a final meeting but nothing structured in the story about them.Assassination of an important person (for the good of humanity) is the core idea of the plot. Though here we are seeing assassins as vandals. Also Templars (Abstergo) looks like a foundation which works on the good of people and preventing the violence. Come on are you serious? When did the mass controlling became a well-meant objective? Then just put another name for that movie.One of a best thing in the game are the assassination moment (Requiescat in pace!) talks between two in a timeless space and it is very cinematic but we couldn't see that in the movie (what a disappointment).Where are the important characters from the history like Rodrigo Borgia, Cesare Borgia, Niccolo Machiavelli, Caterina Sforza, Leonardo da Vinci, Medici Family, Girolamo Savonarola and many others with perfect references and epic historical events related to them? There is only a Christopher Columbus there with a weak story connection.It is quite bad to see that too much potential is just going waste with a sloppy job. I hope this project will be cancelled without a second one."
" What a annoying movie
",-0.4019,0.6683,2020-12-10 00:00:00,1,"When I finished watching i was confused and upset. The story has a simple plot but no depth at all. Watching this movie is like watching a dream. Everything seems to be fragmented like slapstick movies with Buster Keaton. The audience has no clue about the background or the motivation of the acting persons.Of course you see some action and post production effects. But these Scenes look like game trailers because there is no surrounding plot.Apart from the SFX the dialogues, the acting, the camera and everything else is astonishingly unprofessional like a school project.This is by far the worst movie I have seen the last years. Even a c-movie from Uwe Boll is more fun because its fun to watch obvious trash. But this is only boring."
" I played the game after watching it
",0.34,0.9812,2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,"It helps me understand a lot about the whole series. Honestly, it has squeezed a lot of core ides into the plot and personally I think it has spent much effort to be loyal to the series.I love the CG and music of the film, which are so natural and harmonic that I can immerse well into the film soon. Yet the pace is mildly dragged. Fortunately we have Fassbender and his performance in the film is simply outstanding.Overall it looks like a fan film rather than an independent one. I would recommend every AC fan to watch it."
" Shame !!!

Was a damn shame they never made a sequel especially with that cast.

It was just intensively well narrated between the ancient and modern conspiracy of the templars and the brotherhood. The way Abstergo and the Animus has been technologically integrated into the story is just mind blowing. The action sequence, the leaps, the blades, the clothing, the synchronization and the music. Its just a great mixture of excellently done movie. For a game lover I can watch it over and over again."

",0.0,-0.6548,2020-11-21 00:00:00,1,"As someone who loves the overarching plot of the Assassin's Creed series games, this was a painful disappointment. They crammed too much into a 2 hour movie. There was too much exposition, the film literally opens with a wall of text. The dialogue and emotions felt so forced and disjointed, I literally felt none of it.Even the constant cuts to that circling eagle just made me feel annoyed at how frequent it was.Not to mention, everything was SO DUSTY. Like every single scene there were clouds of dust and smoke everywhere, as if they were always in the middle of a sandstorm. Literal stone walls are giving off a constant stream of dust, as if they were sublimating. It's a sign of bad/rushed CG.They should have gone with a series, like The Witcher. Interspersed all the action/important scenes with more context and buildup."

It is a unique sci-fi concept that I haven't seen before, and in a way it involves time-travel, which is easily one of my favorite genres for film. Of course, I don't know why I got my hopes up even slightly since it is a movie based on a video game, and we all know how disastrous that genre has been over the years. Assassin's Creed receives one of the worst criticisms I can possibly dole out to a movie...it is mind-numbingly boring. I've seen worse movies, I've seen more annoying movies, and I've seen movies that utterly repulsed me in every way. Yet I remember all of those movies, and a mere 3 days after watching Assassin's Creed I have forgotten virtually every detail of the film. There was nothing compelling in the slightest about this movie. Not one performance, character, or plot point impacted me in any way.The story is about a guy who travels back in time using a special machine that allows him to relive the memories of his ancestors, so you'd think that's the basis for something interesting. Yet they spend so much time in the future timeline, and exploring this strange war between templars and assassins, that they never deal with the oddity of what they are doing with this machine. The whole thing is a muddled mess of a story, and not one of the characters are interesting. I'm not even sure who we're supposed to see as the good guy in this whole film. They're trying to tell two stories at once, and they don't effectively tell either of them. I cannot remember the last time I was this checked out of a movie. I will retain no memories of this film within a matter of weeks, and might even question if I actually watched it. There is no value in watching Assassin's Creed, I'd suggest people just seek out the video game instead."

The exquisite time frame and places the film was depicted and the format that the film was released when it was shelved makes it a force to be reckoned with. The production companies that invested into the project are well known and modern and the actors are fun actors who've took on several projects whilst the film was being shot on location.
" I LIKE HOW THE SYMBOL OF THE ASSASSINS WERE PRESENTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE, BUT IT BROUGHT ME MORE EXPECTATIONS THAT LEADS INTO SOME OF MY DISAPPOINTMENTS
",-0.5023,0.9793,2020-07-12 00:00:00,4,"First of all, the trailer was a bit long to me. I think the trailer covers the whole plot and I can summarize the movie just by its trailer. It's may be good but for me, its not. The movie seems to elongate the trailer and doesn't tackle more about it.Cal (Michael Fassbender) did a good job in presenting a fierce, strong character within the movie. The thing is, his story was the only story tackled in it. It was like, the movie is about him, not about the troupe or whatever. Also, the asian girl did a great facial expression in portraying one of the assassins. Other than that, the rest of the actors did a horrible job in making the viewers moved by the storyline.In terms of the plot. I think, you will appreciate it more if you are into video games like the Assassin's Creed, but if not, you will get bored of it. On the other hand, the director of this film did a good job specially in battle scenes that makes the viewers feel what the characters feel during the fight.I think that the conflict's resolution made another conflict because it left the viewers thinking about ""what would happen to the female scientist after her dad was killed and her company (which she spend her whole life into getting a certain fruit) was ruined?""After all, the ending was decent but it lacks something. Decent because the Apple did not get into the wrong hands and the Assassins succesfully protected it even in their next life. But it lacks something, like it was meant to left the viewers hanging because THE NEXT STORY WILL BE TOLD IN THE GAMEPLAY! (Which I hate about game-turn-to-movie films)The message of the movie was clear; we easily get Cal's back story and we get why was the company was built for and its founder's agenda. Also, the emotions (rebellion and loyalty) were felt throughout the movie.One of the important details in the film is each character's eyes. Since the movie do not require much talking, they communicate through eyes. Whenever they do not want to be seen, the angle covers the eyes. Fear, coldness, anger, dedication, sadness, and every other emotions were seen through their eyes that is why I love how the frames focuses on these details and zooming to the artifacts/ancient belongings that connects the past to their present that makes the audience relate to their story.""It felt real,"" Cal mumurs. ""It was,"" the doctor answers. For a former patient of a mental institution, the mumur depicts that he is in doubt on himself about seeing and feeling those scenarios for his reality seemed to be tormented by something that doesn't supposed to exist. This dialogue touched me as a viewer considering that in reality we might need some assurance from other people because there are times that we cannot trust ourselves. The writer did a pretty good job in terms of dialogues. As I said before, the film do not requires much talking but when they communicate, the words were meaningful.The cinematography is good, but the editing were quite disappointing. I recommend more polishing in using green screens specially in fighting scenes where they use fast and consecutive rapid movements.Lastly, the soundtrack which is good but only presented at the beginning, middle, and at the end, where post credits are presented."

",0.0,0.9913,2020-05-14 00:00:00,6,"I'm a big fan of the games, and after just watching this I can tell you that the hammering this film gets is unfair. We all know that games being made into films doesn't work, but this is one of the best efforts. The story line is different than the games, but it has a lot of things in it familiar to the games,like the Apple of Edan, the animas etc. The story is easy to follow so the people that aren't into the games might like it too. The animas is different in the movie but it works. You have to take assassins creed for what it is. It's no masterpiece. It's a bit messy, but there's good action and captures the essence of the games really well. Fassbender and irons carry the movie to a degree also, with good performances. Its entertaining and moves at a good pace. I hope there's a second. Give it a try ,I did and I liked it."
" Confusing and dull
",-0.5574,-0.8896,2020-05-11 00:00:00,2,"As many others, having no knowledge and not being familiar with the Assassin's Creed video game but knowing they were quite popular. Cannot compare the video game design with the movie.As a film, this is rather dull, confusing and lacks interests. The scenery is nice to look at, some of the camera shots are well done, and the costumes seem to be represented properly. Though the story is rather boring, doesn't exactly stand out and overall feels like an mess.Hardly any character development as we are apparently supposed to root for Michael Fassbender's character, but it was difficult in such. The acting was bland (perhaps more so the character?) but it did not satisfy or kept any interest.Considering this movie was a major box office disaster, with making $240 million worldwide on a $125 million dollar budget, any plans of a sequel have been since deducted.Not claiming this flop is all of Fassbender faults but it appears he can hardly draw a film as the leading actor- which is a ""shame"" considering his talents. Perhaps he should stay away from these blockbusters and go back to his independent roots in films like Shame and FrankIt is quite bizarre as to how these video game movie adaptations are given such high budgets- when most of them don't make back their profits."
" From an Assassin's Creed fan to another.
",0.3182,0.1406,2020-05-09 00:00:00,4,"I've played every game there is for Assassin's Creed. If you're someone that has played the game and want to see something worth your time, this is not it. This movie is poorly written. The present day lasts longer and slowly, they don't really do anything. Animus is good but poor. It doesn't really live up to the games. They just found an excuse to make a movie that fans would like, but they didn't. Imagine how other people who haven't played the games reacted. They didn't get what the story exactly is. Moves are accurate, assassinations, easter eggs. I think in the end, I saw Arno, Ezio and some other Assassins. That saves some things and sets up something for any upcoming movies. But this movie was not what I wanted."
" Assassin's Creed
",0.0,-0.9981,2020-05-04 00:00:00,3,"I saw the trailer for this movie, obviously based on the video game franchise, I'd never played any of the games myself, but I was prepared to give the film a go, I was just hoping it wouldn't turn out the way the Warcraft movie did. Basically, in 1492 Andalusia, during the Granada War, Aguilar de Nerha (Michael Fassbender) is accepted into the Assassins Brotherhood. He is assigned to protect Prince Ahmed de Granada (Kemaal Deen-Ellis) from the Knights Templar. In 1986, adolescent Callum ""Cal"" Lynch (Angus Brown) finds his mother (Essie Davis) killed by his father, Joseph (Brian Gleeson), a modern-day Assassin. Gunmen led by Alan Rikkin (Jeremy Irons), CEO of the Templars' Abstergo Foundation, arrive to capture Joseph, he tells Cal to escape. In 2016, Cal (Michael Fassbender) is sentenced to death for murder, but his execution is faked by the Abstergo Foundation, who take him to their research facility in Madrid. He is told that the Templars are searching for the Apple of Eden, which has the capability to control humanity's free will, in order to eliminate violence. Sofia (Marion Cotillard), Alan's daughter and the head scientist, reveals that Cal is a descendant of Aguilar, the last person confirmed to be in possession of the Apple. Cal in the Animus, a regression machine which allows him to relive (and the scientists to observe) Aguilar's genetic memories, to learn what happened to the Apple. In 15th-century Spain, Aguilar and his partner, Maria (Ariane Labed), must rescue Ahmed after being kidnapped by the Templar Grand Master Tomas de Torquemada (Javier Gutiérrez), to coerce Ahmed's father, Sultan Muhammad XII (Khalid Abdalla), to surrender the Apple. Aguilar and Maria intercept the Templars, but are overpowered and captured by Torquemada's enforcer, Ojeda (Hovik Keuchkerian). After Cal is pulled from the machine and returns to the facility, he encounters other Assassin descendants held captive. Most of them are suspicious of his motives, apart from Lin (Michelle H. Lin), the descendant of Shao Jun, a 16th-century Chinese Assassin; and Moussa (Michael Kenneth Williams), the descendant of Baptiste, an 18th-century Haitian Assassin and a key leader. Cal begins experiencing hallucinations, dubbed ""the Bleeding Effect"", of both Aguilar and Joseph. Cal and Sofia build a rapport during their sessions; she confides that her mother was also murdered by an Assassin, sharing his hatred of the Brotherhood of which his father is a member. Back in the Animus, Aguilar and Maria are scheduled for execution, but manage to break out, leading to a rooftop chase and an escape using the ""Leap of Faith"". Cal's mind reacts violently to the session and he is temporarily paralysed. When Cal learns that his father (Brendan Gleeson) is also at the facility, he confronts Joseph over his mother's death. Joseph informs him that the Bleeding Effect will mean his present body possess Aguilar's combat abilities. Cal also learns that his mother was an Assassin, she chose to die at his father's hand, rather than be forced into the Animus. Cal vows to destroy the Assassins by finding the Apple. Meanwhile, Alan is pressured by a Templar Elder, Ellen Kaye (Charlotte Rampling), to shut down the multibillion-dollar Animus Project, and Sofia questions her father's true intentions. Reaffirmed by the encounter with his father, Cal enters the Animus willingly, whereupon Aguilar and Maria ambush a meeting between Muhammad and Torquemada. They succeed in killing the Templars and retrieving the Apple, though Ojeda captures Maria. Rather than Aguilar surrendering the Apple, Maria chooses death, and stabs herself on Ojeda's blade. Aguilar kills him and escapes through another Leap, the force of which causes the Animus to violently malfunction. Aguilar gives the Apple to Christopher Columbus (Gabriel Andreu), who promises to take it to his grave. Moussa and the modern Assassin prisoners start a riot in an attempt to escape, leading to Alan ordering the facility purged. Abstergo security kills Joseph and most of the other prisoners. Cal stands in the Animus chamber and meets several his Assassin ancestors through projections, including Aguilar, Arno Dorian (), Joseph and his mother, while sees an Assassin that looks identical to her. Persuaded by his mother, Cal embraces his Assassins' Creed and, having fully assimilated Aguilar's memories and abilities, joins Moussa and Lin escaping the facility. Having retrieved the Apple from Columbus's burial vault, Alan and his followers gather at a ceremony in a Templar sanctuary in London to celebrate their triumph. Inside the sanctuary, a disillusioned Sofia meets with Cal, who has come to take the Apple. Sofia reluctantly allows Cal to retrieve the Apple, he kills Alan to do it. Sofia vows revenge against Cal. The Assassins depart, swearing to protect the Apple from the Templars once again. Also starring Callum Turner as Nathan, The Program's Denis Ménochet as McGowan, Carlos Bardem (Javier's brother) as Benedicto and Matias Varela as Emir. Fassbender is okay, Cotillard is interesting as the main scientist, and Irons and Rampling are suited as the sinister villains. Sadly, this does have similar results to the Warcraft movie, the special effects are terrific, and when they happen the fight and chase sequences are relatively exciting, but it is let down by a rather ridiculous plot and concept involving DNA time-travelling. Fans of the game may be satisfied, I personally was bored, no wonder box office levels were low, the cliffhanger ending means a sequel is possible, otherwise it is a silly science-fiction action adventure. Adequate, in my opinion!"

" Writing this review after the rewatch.
",0.0,0.976,2020-05-03 00:00:00,7,"First of all, let me say that I avoid video games, since when I play a game, I dont communicate with the rest of the world, and I hate that. The Assassin's Creed games, always seemed tempting to me (game about assassins in medieval times? fucking awesome!) but I had never played one.So I was enthusiastically waiting for this movie to come out. I watched it in the theaters and I was disappointed. I don't remember what had bothered me most, but I think the storyline felt odd.Anyway, during covid19 lockdown, when I suddenly has tons of free time, I played Assasin's I, then II and I decided to rewatch the movie. It did not seem as bad as it seemed the first time.The pros:
1. The characteristic Assassin's Creed game adapted scenes, i.e. the free running scene, the fights, the leaps of faith. Those were awesome, and very nicely done.
2. The movie serves as a good backstory for more Assasin's Creed movies. If there will be such movies.
3. The movie Animus is far better than the game Animus.The cons:
1. Too much time spent in ""today"" instead of the past. The plot allocation was like 30% in the past, 70% in the present. It should be the opposite at least. There was no point in showing Lynch's parents storyline, and also why on earth, was the final battle for the apple of Eden in the present instead of the past?
2. The movie also fails to explain one major detail, even though it has spent so much time in the present. That the present person who is synced with his assassin ancestor, simply acquires his ancestor's skills. It is shown, it is never mentioned though.Anyway, the second time I enjoyed it much more than the first time."

" The Apple of Eden
",0.0,0.2732,2020-04-09 00:00:00,4,I thought the whole point of video games was their breakneck speed and visual clarity?Instead Marian Cotillard and Jeremy Irons stand about trying to look impressed in this garrulous mess of restless diffused steadicam photography backed by a continuous musical growl that like the film itself is simply there to maintain a mood of morbid torpor for a long couple of hours.
" Nice photography...very mediocre film.
",0.4215,0.9956,2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Historically it has never been a shrewd choice to get involved with game franchises. Quite what and how Fassbender and Cotillard got involved in this particular fun filled visual treat is beyond me. Maybe Kurzel had some dirt on them after their last film together, or he got them to sign the contract while drunk at an after event party. I don't know. Despite all that, Fassbender puts on his best face and for once I thought this might actually buck the trend of game adaptations.With the likes of Fassbender, Gleeson, the beautiful and equally talanted Coltillard and the ever amazing Jermony Irons (well ok maybe not Irons as he was also daft enough to appear in Dungeons & Dragons) you would think you're pretty straight on for a solid film right? Even one with the film curse to be based off of a video game. Well, once again, it seems the curse is the much stronger still. They may as well have just asked Uve Boll to direct it, roped Ms Minogue in and have had done with it.Add in a script that no less than three different people workd on (never a good idea folks), a reletively unknown director living off the coattails of a semi-successful first film in his home country (based upon nothing else but shocks and extreme visual elements, the film itself is not that good) and a cast that must have turned up for the pay-cheque rather than any sense of a chance of the Oscars (though Fassbender and Cotillard did work under Kurzel in Macbeth) then you might be forgiven for thinking that you might have a bit of a mess of a film on your hands. You would be correct.Anyway, according to the opening titles, for centuries, the order of the Knights Templar have searched for the mythical Apple of Eden. They believe it contains not only the seeds of man's first disobedience, but the key to the free will itself. And maybe to a decent video game crossover film? No, didn't think so. That's even too much for the Templars and Illuminati to manage. Regardless, opening to this narrative to the Knights Templar we are then taken to a deep underound complex where unfortunately the film makers were not tortured without mercy. Sorry, I digress.A rather interesting and slighty confusing scene in Mexico is joined with us seeing Cal Lynch (Fassbender) awaiting his execution. Only he isn't. Well he is, in his mind, but the old nefarious secret orginsations are interfering in peoples lives again. You know the stuff of which I speak. All terribly inconvenient when you say your final goodbyes and then wake up very much alive in a secret underground complex at the mercy of those who 'rescued' you.Cal quickly learns of his ancestral past and a way in which he can access the memories of said ancestor. For those of you have know the game series, the animus and it's workings will be familer. This film does also somewhat tie into Assasins Creed: Origins despite Ubisoft stating they wanted to keep the two separate. But then hey, Ubisoft, as cancerous a gaming company as EA is.The audio is rather shocking, in that while the score is reasonably good by the standards of this kind of film, it literally pretty much drowns everything else out. You know my views on bad audio in films. If the adult industry can get it right, a hollywood film with a one hundred and twenty-five million dollar budget certainly has no excuse. The score is pretty good though in the 'Spanish' sections of the film.Visually the film looks nice, if one can see past all the dust. I'm sure they actually imported dust in by the container full. By the time ends, you'll be metaphorically dusting yourself off there is that much of it. The set-peice action scenes are passable as they should be with this kind of budget but the constant back and forth between the real world and the memories/past grates very quickly. We get it, my cat got it too.Acting is reasonably good but all have been and can do much better. Cotillard, Gleeson and Irons are largely unused and have rather reserved roles wich really could have been played by anyone. In fact I wouold say the only real highlight in this average fare are the costumes and set designs, both of which are excellent. To sum up, save yourself the bother and just go and watch The Prince of Persia instead.

" More incompetent than bad
",-0.7996,0.9388,2020-04-04 00:00:00,4,"I mean, I can't really hate a movie that has such a great cast. I mean, we have Michael Fassbender, Jeremy Irons, Marion Cotillard and so many others. Having all them interact, even in a lazily written script, is still a treat.Plus I like how they visualized Animus, the time travel machine used to send Fassbender's mind into the past. It's inventive, visually cool-looking and allows the actor to move in both timelines simultaneously.That being said, it's not a good movie. I'm passingly familiar with the video games this is based on and it doesn't capture the mythos and scope of them at all. But even as a standalone semi-historical adventure movie it's sub-par. Most notably because it's hard to follow and in quite a rush. We have to mix two totally different timelines and their respective conflicts, explain Fassbender's sordid past, Cotillard's sordid past, Irons's sordid past, the whole rivalry between Templars and Assassins, and so on, and so on. There's no way you can fit all that in a movie under two hours long.This should have been a TV series. Barring that, they should have dropped the modern day stuff and simply made a movie about Assassins and Templars fighting in 15th century Spain. Because all the best stuff is in those scenes.Well okay, those scenes don't have Marion Cotillard or Jeremy Irons, but you could have found them other roles.Perhaps worth a watch if you're a diehard fan of the video games, although it's risky. Aside from that, the film is visually interesting and some of the fight scenes are above average."
" Surprisingly good video game movie
",0.6249,0.9921,2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"I was really skeptical about this one, because it's a video game movie, and those are hit-or-miss. (Mostly miss.) I also knew very little about the source material going in, but that gave me an advantage because I was able to judge it purely on its own merit as a film and not based on whether or not it was a ""faithful adaptation."" I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was a little silly at points, and some times it felt like it was hitting me over the head by constantly reiterating ""This is the hero's goal. This is the artifact we're looking for. Don't forget it. You won't foreget it because we're going to drill it into your head 20 more times in the next 10 minutes,"" and that got annoying really fast, but overall I enjoyed this movie. It had a sort of futurisitc ""Indiana Jones'' feel. The acting from Michael Fassbender was fantastic. His performance was by far the best one in the movie. The action sequences were well choreographed, and this film was super fun! Unfortunately, since this is a video game movie which did terribly with critics, this probably won't get a sequel, which is a shame, really, considering that the film ends on a mild cliffhanger. (Why couldn't this have just stood alone?) Seems like the filmmakers put the cart before the horse by planning on making this a franchise before seeing how well it actually did. I really want a sequel to this, but even if we don't get one, I still enjoyed myself. It was a lot more fun than I expected, and surprisingly well-done, especially for a video game movie.

" One of the worst cases of a video game transformed into a movie
",-0.6249,0.961,2020-03-17 00:00:00,5,"Assassin's Creed was once a great video game franchise. However, quantity has become more important than quality over the past few years. The market has become over-saturated with countless video games, novels and other merchandise. The release of this movie can be considered the franchise's nadir.To start on a positive note, the movie's special effects look impressive thanks to a generous budget. The visual and sound elements are truly immersive. The locations in ancient Spain look stunning. The martial arts fight scene are intense.Everything else is disappointing however. The story is overall confusing, lacking structure and extremely thin. The characters are particularly unlikable and viewers won't care about their fates at all. The actors and actresses seem to have phoned in their performances that lack conviction, depth and talent. The locations in present-day Spain are bland, grey and repetitive.This movie is only interesting for die-hard fans of the franchise. It's one of the worst cases of a video game that was made into a movie. The hype surrounding this franchise has overstayed its welcome and this movie has rightfully been received unfavourably."

This experience brings to mind ""Max Payne"" when I was on the other front where I played the game, Loved it then hated the movie. With that said I can say this movie was a victim of""overexpecting"" _ if we might_ which sadly enough made the producers fear to make the sequel till now"

Concerning a dark brotherhood nicknamed ""The Assassins"" that protects ¨The Apple of Eden¨ against the known Templars , an opressive and powerful Knights Order. There is a historical setting as King Ferdinand of Spain and Queen Isabella are besiegeing the Granada kingdom where rules the last Muslim ruler , Boabdil . And other historic figures as Torquemada who presided Inquisition trial , being played by Javier Gutierrez, this character was even performed by Marlon Brando himself in ""1492 the Discovery"" (1992) by John Glen . As well as appearance by Christopher Columbus embarking on Palos de Moguer Huelva to discover America , being briefly played by Gabriel Andreu . Decent main cast and support cast delivering acceptable interpretations . Michael Fassbender gives a passable acting as the brave convict , sentenced to lethal injection , who discovers he is descended from a bizarre secret society and then he will attempt to stop the nasty Templars . Marion Cotillard is the heroine who runs a revolutionary technology at the Abstergo Company that fakes deaths and takes condemned people to practice them rare experiments . Jeremy Irons is her father called Alan Rikkin, the CEO of the technological enterprise . Secondary cast is pretty good, such as : Charlotte Rampling, Michael Kenneth Williams , Matias Varela , Essie Davies as Cal's mother , Brendan Gleeson and his son Brian Gleeson . And with plenty of Latin actors playing Spanish people as Carlos Bardem, Javier Gutierrez as Torquemada , Gabriel Andreu as Colón , Julio Jordán and Juan Pablo Shuk .And Arab actors interpreting Muslim roles : Kemaal Elis as Price Ahmed and Abdella as Sultan Muhammad.It packs colorful and evocative cinematography by Adam Arkapaw . Although excessive use of regular Chrome and abundant 3D Computer Generator . Shot on location, mostly in Spain : Sevilla , Alhambra of Granada, Cabo Gata, desert Tabernas, Almeria, and Island of Malta, and London. As well as thrilling and moving musical score by Kurzel , director's brother . The picture was professional but regularly directed by Justin Kurzel who has made a few films as ¨The story of the Kelly Gang¨, ¨The turning¨, ¨Snowtown¨ and his greatest hit : ¨Macbeth¨ that was also played by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, in fact during this shooting , actor/producer Fassbender convinced Justin to make ¨Assassin's Creed¨. Rating : 5.5/10. Acceptable and passable. The motion picture will appeal to Michael Fassbender , Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons fans."

As I'm not a gamer (and therefore not familiar with the game) I judge a film on an entertainment value perspective, and not on the adaptation value from game to film, or book to film, for that matter.From an entertainment perspective, this was highly entertaining. The premise is a bit far-fetched and not all that easy to grasp, but once you familiarize yourself with the characters and events, it will be easier. A second viewing might be required to fully understand. Despite that, the film is fast-paced and action-packed with fantastic visuals, photography and cinematography. Michael Fassbender is a worthy hero, and in excellent shape. He brings more emotion to the film that should be allowed for a film of this genre, but he's just that good.With spectacular sets, impressive action sequences and being stunningly filmed, 'Assassin's Creed' is a thrilling action adventure fantasy to enjoy again and again.

The action is going to be hit or miss for most people, you either love it or you hate it because it's edited in a very fast way, not letting people really know what is happening and the story, even though it was very criticised, I found enjoyable and involving.All in all this is a decent film that I think most video game or action fans should watch... just don't expect ""The Godfather""!C+"

However this was a damn hine movie and a great way to get people who have never played the game or read the books, into it.
During an interview Fassbender said some of reasons it bombed were that the action didn't kick off immediately. Action without context is okay! But the commitmemt to the issues of time, the honor to duty, you need that context.
He also said the layered timelines shouldn't hae been done. He was wrong, it's brilliant! You get to understand the strugle to survive as a people, a child loss of everything, only to find it again. Really good social commentary in a day and age when often, to fit in, we put aside our heritage and traditions.
The split tome lines also opened the way for two parralel franchises, one following modern day assassins and another following the characters the fans already know and love anchored in the past.I really hope the get off their backsides ans get to work on more films. If Fassbender doesn't want back in, move on to a different assassin."

Not to mention the action parts of the movie were done wonderfully, have to say michael fassbender (or whatever's his name) did a great job.
Last, the idea. Yeah you've seen this in the games (only if you played them), but have you seen this in any other movies? You haven't. So why such a low score for an original idea with a great plot and action? Ask the snowflakes.Like some other dude said around here, I'd love a sequel too.

Then the old guy is supposedly the bad guy but you can't understand his voice because it's sounds like he's been smoking for 500 years.

The only cool thing was when the main character Cal (Michael Fassbender) travels back during the time of the Spanish Inquisition which leads to a cool fight scene. It's also cool to hear the Castilian accent. Aside form that this movie's a huge dud.

" Doesn't break the trend for video game adaptations
",0.0,0.9824,2019-05-12 00:00:00,4,"Despite numerous critical and commercial failures over the last quarter of a century, Hollywood just cannot turn away from trying to capitalise on an industry that continues to out to out-gross them. Video game adaptations have been a thing ever since Nintendo tried and catastrophically failed to bring to life the colourful world of Mario and Luigi with 1993's Super Mario Bros., and it's become a running joke ever since that there has never been, and will unlikely ever be, a decent console-to-big-screen adaptation. But the $1 billion-plus success of Capcom's Resident Evil franchise lingers in the minds of many a studio head, so pretty much every year a new cast and crew are put together to develop a game series with a promise to break the trend.While the likes of Prince of Persia and Rampage are perfectly serviceable fluff, they are way overshadowed by the unbearable awfulness of a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, or a Max Payne, or whatever hot turd Uwe Boll is serving up that month. We have gone through the disappointment too many times to believe it when a director promises to stick to the source material, but eyebrows were raised when it came to the inevitable movie adaptation of Ubisoft's hugely successful Assassin's Creed series, which plunged you into a centuries-old battle between the Knights Templar and a shadowy group known as the Assassins. Not only was Justin Kurzel, director of the truly unsettling Australian drama Snowtown and Shakespeare epic Macbeth, to helm the film, but Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, two of the most respected actors in the business, were also signed up for the leads. Could this be the movie to finally bridge the two mediums and match the success of its source material?The short answer is no, but by no means is Assassin's Creed a complete disaster. Its main problem is that it depicts two worlds from two different periods in time, but forgets to make them both interesting. We have the Inquisition-era Madrid, where hooded assassins move stealthily through the crowd armed with daggers and their wits, as they attempt to bring down those in power who seek peace in the land through control. The Assassins also long for peace, but peace gained through freedom, and they don't want a McGuffin known as the Apple of Eden, which somehow possesses the power to block humanity's free will, falling into their hands. This war has raged on for centuries, and in the modern era - a glum grey world full of murky corridors and empty rooms - the Templar continue their search for the Apple, employing a new technology that allows people to travel into the memories of their ancestors, to track down the allusive object through the centuries.We spend the bulk of the time in the present day, as convicted criminal Cal Lynch (Fassbender) is saved from the electric chair by Sofia (Cotillard) and spends much of his time brooding in his cell over the murder of his mother. I get the feeling that writers Michael Lesslie, Adam Cooper and Bill Collage want to keep you in the dark about who the good guys are here, but as soon as Jeremy Irons arrives with his black turtleneck sweater, you pretty much know how this is going to play out. The plot is an odd mixture of overly complicated and incredibly stupid, and much of the screentime is spent having these characters explain it to each other and the audience, or at least those in the crowd who have never played the game (like myself). When Cal finally straps up and enter the body of his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha, the movie springs into life, although this bleached-out world of questionable special effects and wannabe-Indiana Jones action may have seemed all the more exiting by the sheer dreariness of the alternative."

Actor say one thing, and the expression is quite different. It is clear that the assassins should be cold-blooded, but still they are all people.The end is not clear at all.How did you get such an outcome?

" Good early action but ends disappointingly
",-0.4404,0.9705,2019-04-11 00:00:00,6,"The introduction to this film explains how the Knights Templar are searching for an item known as the 'Apple of Eden' which they believe will end mankind's' violent tendencies by ending free will. Standing against them are the Assassins Brotherhood; a group dedicated to protecting the Apple and maintaining free will. The Apple was last seen in 1492 when it was taken by an assassin named Aguilar de Nerha.In 2016 Cal Lynch is 'executed' for murder in Texas... except he isn't killed; he wakes in a Templar facility in Spain. Here he is told that he is the last descendent of Aguilar and using a machine known as the Animus he is forced to live his ancestor's memories in an attempt to discover where the Apple is now hidden.Given that this is based on a highly popular video game franchise I feel I must point out that I've not played any of the games so can't say how true to the feel of them it is; I can just judge it as a film. The plot is nicely explained early on and I liked how the sections set in fourteenth century Spain were in Spanish... even if the subtitles could have done with being a little bigger. The film delivers lots of impressive action even if some of the swordplay felt toned down to get a UK-12/PG13 certificate... it will certainly feel tame to anybody who enjoys samurai films! Part of me thought that it might have been better if it was just set in the past but I understand that it has to keep some faith with the source material or it would just be a medieval adventure. The action sequences are impressively handled and the special effects are pretty good. The story played out well until the ending when things got too scrappy a bit confusing. Michael Fassbender does a fine job in the dual roles of Cal and Aguilar and Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons are solid as Dr Sofia Rikkin, the scientist who invented the Animus, and her father who runs the facility. Overall not a must see but neither was it as terrible as some reviews suggest; decent action with a somewhat messy, and disappointing end."

" Fangirl of Games, NAF of Movie
",0.0,0.9868,2019-04-06 00:00:00,3,"I've played all the AC Games, the reason I loathed this film adaptation was it was like seeing all the gameplay stitched into one and labeled ""a film."" There was no sense of story and the magic of what gamers and fan of game likes about the franchise. 1. I hate the Abestos storyline in the game franchise... I don't know anyone who enjoys being taken out of the game to do menial subplot duties on the Abestos plot part, you're playing to be the Assassin. 2. This is one possible reason why the movie failed. Bc the storyline wasn't the Assassin dimension at all but the Abestos dimension and the Assassin dimension was just something Cal was linked up into via wires on his head but he had no control of the Assassin - he himself like the viewer was watching everything as if it were gameplay but had no control of being the Assassin. 3. I would have enjoyed the opening world being Cal; this average guy from the Hood who gets sub par grades bc he doesn't try hard enough, doesn't know where he's headed in his future... and then suddenly he gets a calling to reveal something from the ancestors past but he still needs to learn how to be an assassin in order to get to the truth (this is why we all play this game... to grow and to become the Assassin from humble beginnings) ... Cal then has a purpose and a sense of legacy. That would have worked: Instead we see Cal as this already buff, handsome stallion that is Michael Fassbender and he really has not much to gain as for as physical finessing and all he needs to do when he gets to the Corp is to connect to a machine and watch a story go down, completely without real physical, mental prowness.In conclusion, it almost ruined playing the game for me but I had to tell myself ""it's just a movie. And clearly the filmmakers and Ubisoft didn't know each other's medium to make this truly fun for everyone.""If you are a gamer like me.... the enjoyment and thrill of what engages us in the game is lost on this one."

To do this they will hide information and devices that could harm us and act like this is for our own good. The Assassins are all about choice and free will. Namely a choice made by somebody else is not a choice, it's control and man should choose his own path. As such they've fought through time trying to destroy each other and to do this they try to control ancient artifacts that have strange and mystical powers. The Templars want them to use them and keep man ignorant. The Assassins want to keep them safe for a time when man can use them to better themselves. And that's the key to the story. One side wants control, one side wants freedom to choose.But what we get in this movie is something different. We get a bare bones explanation of things in favor of whiz bang special effects, lots of CGI and no actual reason for why things are the way they are.The only good thing I can say about this movie is that they've gone for an original story instead of simply adapting one of the games to the screen. The new Animus they plug the Assassins into is much different and it allows for complete freedom of movement. However the Templars, or more specifically the company they run called ""Abstergo"" seem to have forgotten the so called ""bleeding effect"" whereby the longer you stay in the machine and experience the life of your ancestors, the more time their skills and abilities bleed over into your life. And guess what happens? All these badass Assassins wind up learning the skills of their ancestors and fight back for their freedom. Brilliant move there guys.A lot more could have been done for this but I felt it was all wasted on flashy special effects and Michael Fassbender looking badass. A better script that more closely followed the existing lore would have made for a much better movie."

That being said I'd read all the critics reviews and everyone panned this movie as total rubbish, which just goes to show what critics really know.
I enjoyed this movie, if you want just some escapism this movies for you, the story is great easy to follow and keeps (generally) to Ac lore.
The action is great and the acting is good.
So watch this if you just want to be entertained."

The script was all over the place, making no sense at all. It was bad to say the least, full of cliches and stupid 90s leftovers. The acting was awful, even more so considering that they had talent on board. The action was not so bad but it was marred by strange directing decisions such as smoke and dust everywhere, bad cuts and some really weird scenes. Did I mention that there's no logic in this movie from start to finish? The beginning was weird and nothing is explained. The middle was incredulous (oh top security experimental prison with born-killers but no guns for the guards... great idea!) . The ending... WTF was the ending about? Was that a setup for AC2 ? No, thank you that was more than enough. All in all, I was determined to give this a 6 but after consideration 4 is more appropriate."
" A film with no vision.
",-0.0516,0.7792,2019-02-26 00:00:00,2,"A film with truly no vision behind it, the bland and boring and confusing, 'Assassin's Creed'. Based on the video games which I am a big fan of because of the interesting story and characters and most importantly the action. The action in this film consists of constantly cutting between characters and never being able to keep focus on what is going on. The film is confusing even to the biggest Assassin's Creed fans, the characters are extremely 1 dimensional that not even Michael Fassbender who is trying his hardest to make this film appear competent. The story does not make sense as Fassbender's character constantly changes motivation, and is able to learn the skills of an Assassin without even knowing that there was an ""Assassin's creed"" brotherhood. Unless you like seeing awful action and confusing plot-lines that go nowhere, I do not recommend this ""film""."
" Pleasantly surprised, considering...
",0.6124,0.9959,2019-02-24 00:00:00,9,"So I'm late to the party. I've only just finished watching this, and I got to ask ""why all the negative reviews?""First off, I'm a fairly big assassin's creed fan. I have either played or currently own 75% of the the games, the music, collectables, books...not a die hard AC fan, but I have definitely enjoyed what Ubisoft have brought to the table thus far.I'm also a fan of Micheal Fassbender. I think his roles as Magneto in the X-Men prequels are spot on. Same with the Alien/Prometheus prequels, he's a talented actor, and can pretty much fit any role in any movie. I was excited upon the announcement of Micheal being the lead in this movie, and with supporting roles from Jeremy Irons and Miranda, I thought that this could be a success.However, I have been putting it off due to all the negative, low scores from both critic and user reviews. But today, I finally plucked up the courage to watch it, via Netflix.It exceeded my expectations.I seriously cannot see how this movie has such a vast majority of low scores. It was very enjoyable, and a satisfying viewing of a live action feature film set within the series of video games.The stunts were great. The atmosphere of ""who's really the bad guys here?"". There's no clear answer, and that's how it should be. Both Assassins and Templars want the same thing, just via different approaches and views. The graphics/cgi were extremely impressive. The fighting sequences, the story, the acting, characters...all worked really well.My only gripe is that it wasn't long enough, and, like the majority of comments have mentioned, a sense of wanting more after. Also would have liked to see some throwbacks and nods to previous characters, items and locations. But hopefully, if they make a sequel/trilogy, it can be expanded on.If you like the series and if you play the games, give it a go. It really does help if you head into the movie with at least some knowledge of the AC universe, as newcomers to the franchise may have a hard time understanding and figuring out what's what.Definitely, thoroughly enjoyed this movie."

Pour story, real bad direction, the action scenes totally sucks. You must have played the games to understand many references and sometimes even what is going on. And you should probably just keep playing the games and not watch this movie. e.g. Why exclaim ""the leap of faith!"" Just once when the guy jump? It's seriously useless except to tell people ""see? It's like the games!""
Many scenes has pointless and enormously naïf references and explanations. I don't know if the guilt of this should fall on the screenwriter or the directions, but it look likes the choice that has been made has been take by some guy who happened to be there and had no idea of how to do his job.
Fassbender and Cotillard could have been a blessing but the direction and the screenplay manage to kill they're performance by making them doing senseless thing, acting like weird (and I mean weird also outside the Creed and Templars' feud).
I seriously can't find one reason to watch this movie, except to watch it in order to understand what a bad movie is.

I watched it as the premise sounded interesting and I like action movies. Well, it wasn't bad. Fassbender was pretty good in the lead role and the action sequences were good. I just thought it could have been so much better. I think it could have been better just simply set in ancient times with the Creed vs the Knights Templer hunting after religious artifacts rather than the modern day subplot. I also think the ending was such an anticlimax. Without giving too much away the Templers spend the whole time hunting for the object to just simply lose it without much effort at the end. Just seemed very lame and did not make and sense. I didn't not enjoy it but would never watch again or recommend it really"

",0.0,-0.9712,2019-02-03 00:00:00,3,"ASSASSIN'S CREED is the latest unremarkable film adaptation of a popular video game series. This sees an autopilot Michael Fassbender hooking up to some futuristic technology that enables him to live the life of an assassin in medieval Spain, battling against sinister Inquisition members and Knights Templar for possession of a magical artefact. Sadly, the film itself is a dire mish-mash of futuristic mumbo jumbo (with the most obvious villains ever) with bitty action sequences based on the game; these cheat by employing endless CGI in the fights, with characters turning into CGI animations to pull off otherwise impossible stunts at times. It seems to have been made by people without attention spans who have no idea how action should ebb and flow; they should check out some of the Hong Kong classics to see how to do this kind of stuff."

So when something bordering on interesting does happen, the viewer is left wondering exactly what just happened.I appreciate that this is a video game adaption and it's tailored to fans of the games.

Rather than being a hindrance to the overall product, I believe this ""flaw"" serves the style of this movie wonderfully, and honors to source material to create an interesting and engaging fictional world.The discerning eye of a devoted film-goer may think this movie is quite beautiful and would find very little argument from me. Certain shots and choices in lighting are remarkable, and the filmmakers emphasis on practicality over computer renderings translates very well during the action sequences.I would recommend this film - you may not love it, and you don't have to - but it is certainly worth watching."
" It's time to make history...well, maybe later.
",0.0,0.6358,2019-01-09 00:00:00,4,"One of the biggest challenges movies face today is to produce a motion picture film, based on a video game, that manages to keep fans satisfied. If you think about some of the famous games that have been transformed into a motion picture, some of these include:
* Super Mario Bros (Painful)
* Streetfighter (Awful)
* Mortal Kombat (Meh)
* Dead Alive (Avoid)
* Double Dragon (Double Headaches)
* DOOM (lol)
All disappointing.The only major video game film that I have praised in the past has been the 1st Resident Evil film. Well, until the sequels arrived after...I personally have played many of the Assassins Creed games and it's also one of the most creative games I have ever completed. Upon seeing the film's trailer and hearing that Michael Fassbender was in it (him being a huge fan of the game) I personally questioned to myself: could this be the film that finally breaks the chain of poor video games turned into movies?For those who are unaware of the plot, Cal Lynch (Michael Fassbender) has been sentenced to jail and is on death row. Upon receiving a lethal injection, Cal is surprised to wake up and find himself in a strange facility. Cal has been given a second chance at life and is needed to save the world. The staff in the facility where he is reveal that Cal is in fact a descendant of a secret Assassin who lived over 500 years ago. Thanks to technology, Cal is able to ""plug in"" to a machine and relive parts of his ancestor's life and discover an answer to a big question, the answer of which will save our world.As stated above, I love the Assassins Creed stories from the video games, but delivery to film has disappointed me. Cal (Fassbender) in particular, is a character who viewers won't care about and will have no emotional connection with. Being an ex-criminal at the start of the film, this character doesn't grow or expand any further than developing some Assassin's skills here and there. Cal's personality is flat and he never appears shocked or surprised at finding himself in this new world. The dialogue also feels poorly written even though you can tell actor Michael Fassbender is doing his absolute best with what he's been given.Unless you're aware of the games, many movies goers may struggle with understanding the film's plot and find some scenes very confusing. This movie is truly aimed at the fans. Assassins Creed delivers action scenes which are very quick, with scenes feeling like snippets that only last 2/3 seconds per shot, along with the shaky camera style we have seen in many films. Something that should look amazing ends up with the viewer spending more time trying to work out what is going on. This was an absolute shame for me because the new world that Cal is introduced to does look stunning visually and it's evident that a lot of hard work has gone into this film. The director of this film, ""Justin Kuzel"" worked with Fassbender in 2005's MacBeth and that movie showed me that the overall visuals of Assassins Creed should be fun to see!Assassins Creed was overall disappointing, with a jumpy storyline, poor script and messy action sequences. By the end, it was hard for me to be excited or have a passion in seeing a continuation through a sequel. Sadly, this was not the film to break the classic Videogame to movie curse.
For fans only.4.1/10

I've only briefly played the game so I can't tell if my critique is relevant to the games. I do know that the graphics in the film are excellent even though they are not as groundbreaking as games have been because we are used to this level of graphics in movies but the games manage it in open worlds in real time.
The historic environments created are graphically stunning but always shown in action scenes so we never get a chance to revel in the stunning visuals.
The plot however is where it all falls apart. It starts off OK: we meet a man on death row who is saved because his gene line gives him the ability to connect with an important historic figure through a machine. Using the machine he can relive moments of his ancestors life. The scientist behind it want to find an ancient secret his ancestor might be able to reveal.
The problem throughout is that sides pitted against each other are both fraught with problems and neither one feels either plausible nor good, so to mask this they muddle the story but in the end it all falls flat.
*******************
SPOILERS - Deconstructing the story
*******************
The story sets up the religious ""Knights Templar"" against the ""Assassins Creed"" and the Templars are bad because they want to end free will using an ancient artifact. If they are using the bible to justify this they are on shaky ground. If I remember correctly the biblical god chooses to kill everybody to get rid of sin rather than removing free will, so apparently the free will thing is rather important to him. It is also interesting how unclear it is how this is going to happen - the Templars have the apple on at least 2 occasions and triumphantly show it to their followers but we never find out how it would work.
The Assassins on the other hand are not ""just"" an opposing force trying to maintain free will they seem to be a religious sect of zelots that want complete anarchy and violence.
So the plot is both ridiculous and pits evil against evil with no reason in sight. I hope the games have more nuance, because the film has none."

If done correctly, this movie would have made millions and set up the movies for an entire series of money-makers that would have a huge non-gamer following attached. Like Lord of the Rings that had been around long before it was popular, Assassin's Creed would have followed the same path from a gamer cult to a world wide following.There were so many mistakes made in the creation of this movie and I strongly suggest you fire your concept and writing teams. They got it wrong. You want this movie done right? Ask REAL AC gamers. Fassbender was a pretty good choice though. But the way the story was represented? Completely wrong. Yeah sure, you got the technical facts, but they were presented in the most boring, money-losing, terribly way.I mean the fact that you as a director took an amazing concept and story and obliterated it making it the confusing, stupid, boring, and lame movie it came to be speaks a lot to your talent.

He experiences the adventures of his ancestor who was an assassin in 15th Century Spain. He gains the skills of a Master Assassin and he understands more from now on as his main goal is to collect a very important item which is considered lost for many centuries.I have to admit that since I am a fan of the video game ""Assassin's Creed"" I had high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, I was let down by it because even a very good cast needs a movie with substance and a better meaning. The direction which was made by Justin Kurzel was average, there were some good action scenes with plenty of fight but they were interrupted by something and in many cases, the audience expected more from it. I liked the interpretation of Michael Fassbender who played as Cal Lynch / Aguilar de Nerha but I believe he didn't reach his potential. I also liked the interpretations of Marion Cotillard who played as Sofia and Jeremy Irons who played as Rikkin but I have the same feeling as with the interpretation of Michael Fassbender, they didn't reach their true potential.Lastly, I have to say that ""Assassin's Creed"" is an average action movie with also an average plot and many surprises or plot twists. It has an amazing and very famous cast but the direction isn't the best and this can be easily understood in the whole duration of the movie. If you are a fan of the video games of ""Assassin's Creed"" then I am sure that you are going to be disappointed by this movie but if you just want to watch it just be prepared for it."

",0.1027,0.996,2018-08-02 00:00:00,5,"""Assassin's Creed"" is an action/adventure film based on the video game by the same name. Although, liberty seems to have been taken to distance itself far away from the actual lore of said video games since only the basic premise, terminology, and feel remain intact. Coming off of ""Macbeth,"" Justin Kurzel directs this film with similar visual flare and style that feel stylized enough to make it incredibly interesting while not letting it feel bogged down by too much green screen or CGI. The film overall has a real feel to it and if practical effects were minimal, I was definitely fooled because the visual effects did look good. Unfortunately, ""Assassin's Creed"" fails as a movie overall by not delivering a memorable experience with so much great cinematic potential. On the script front, it just fails as a coherent plot that moves from point A to point B. It's easy to become confused by this mess of a screenplay that I genuinley wonder what happened in the writers room. Not only do events feel unfitting for the overall theme and direction of the story, but character motivations and related dialogue are truly head-scratching. As the film progresses, I constantly was asking myself why each character was doing what they're doing and where it was leading. The general premise itself hooked me and I thought I was in for a real treat but as the 2nd act progresses, the film looses all clarity and vision and becomes a simple showcase of impressive acrobatics and stunts. The film however doesn't fail on every front. With a talented cast of Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, and Jeremy Irons, each role is well executed considering what content is there to be worked with. It's apparent everyone is giving it some real effort and they are entertaining to watch. The film is also shot and scored nicely. I found the cinematography striking and composed beautifully. Excellent use of lighting gave the impression of real time action that had stakes. The musical score also felt not only entertaining but more original than most I've heard recently. Those technical aesthetics aside, action sequences lost their tension due to jarring cuts and poor editing choices. It seems that the saving graces of the film were slightly damaged in the cutting room.Overall, ""Assassin's Creed"" wasn't just a disappointing film, it just didn't work. Enough talent helped make it watchable and pleasant to look at but at the end of the day, the script couldn't be saved and it became a wasted opportunity for a great film.

I would rather stare at my wallpaper, then watch those mindnumbing stories about action heroes that arent for a second connected to anything remotely true to life. But ""Assassin's Creed"" is not just kids stuff, this is seriously impressive. Adults and arthouse movie geeks could appreciate this frenetic, mindtwisting story as well.I really was so surprised by the impressively, frightening undertones of this movie that I wanted to find out more about who directed this movie. Justin Kurzel is the director's name.And then I immediatedly understood why this movie aint nowhere near any other ordinary hollywood action movie. This director has in his young carreer already achieved worldwide acclaim with ""Snowtown"". Just check out the trailer on Imdb, that is seriously heavy stuff. No kids stuff at all, although kids have leading roles in it. Afterwards he made ""MacBeth"". Another hardhitting gritty action movie. Michael Fassbender produced this adaptation of this action game himself. That means he must have had a lot of control over the end result. And that shows, because ""Assassin's Creed"" has got terrific acting in it and no hollywood ending, which I applaud. I immediatedly want to praise the soundtrack as well, which is one of the best ones I have heard in a long time. Chilling, powerful music that went under my skin. So did this movie.""Assassin's Creed"" is a story about timetravel. The goal of going back in time is to save a symbol that preserves men's free will. Will they be able to destroy this symbol of men's own free will or will it be protected for future mankind? That 's the suspense of the story in a nutshell. I know, this sounds childish and bizarre. When I would read such a synopsis of the story myself I would immediatedly disregard this picture. But please give it a try, because when I started to watch it, with a lot of negative expectations, I soon noticed the enormous acting and direction qualities. For example, I was so pleased to see Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling acting again. Those are masters at their skills and although they only play supporting roles, their emotional impact is very powerful. ""Assassin's Creed"" is one of those few exceptions in which a game truly has become a very impressive movie.""Assassin's Creed"" is ofcourse not a cinematic masterpiece, because it is still catered to the youth, hence the boring action sequences that go on for too long, but that's the only flaw of this movie though, the rest is truly impressive. In it's own action hero genre I would say this is one of the best I have seen in years. ""Logan"" comes to mind as an equally powerful action hero movie, which can be enjoyed by adults and arthouse moviegeeks as well..."

Most of these bad reviews are from gamers which I can understand, but it's a movie, it's not aimed for just us gamers it's meant for others as well. I know this will probably never get it's sequel, which is sad, but I would really love to see one with all these actors, like they know what went wrong with this movie, so give them a second chance to fix it.

" Everything is permitted, but just really fast with not much explanation
",0.0,0.9974,2018-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Based on the hugely popular video game franchise, ""Assassin's Creed"" is the first time an attempt has been made to transfer the concept to the big screen. Transferring video games to the big-screen is a very tricky dark art, not many have been successfully or even enjoyed cult status - so from the get-go, making an AC film was always going to come under scrutiny from games fans. So, Assassins Creed - I had to try and explain it to my girlfriend as best as I could so I think that explanation will probably work here. A secret society's science division has worked out a way to immerse distant blood relatives of long dead historical figures, into the memories and experiences they had when they were alive. Say what? It's like if, say, if Christopher Columbus's great, great, great, great, great, grandchild (or another distant relative) could put on a virtual reality headset and see and experience everything that Columbus saw and experienced. By doing this to people, the secret society hopes to learn things from the past, to shape the future. That's the techie part done with. Throw into the mix a secret struggle between two opposing factions, the Templars and the Assassins Creed. The Templar's, throughout history, have wanted to control society and dictate their rule. The Creed on the other hand, opposes them and wants people to live free. Still with me? So, in a nutshell - Michael Fassbender's character is rescued and put to work in this techie VR, to experience something that his distant relative experienced, to help the secret society who owns the VR kit. He has to figure out who he's working for, what they want, and who he is. Did I enjoy the film? From purely a film fan stand point, yeah it was ok. From a fan of the games, well, it wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible enough to sully the reputation the games have created. In my opinion there is a lot of good source material available - but let's not forget, this is an introduction to the situation on film, something more in depth may have been off-putting. The pace of the film was good; it was constantly on the move, which owed itself well to the pace of the games sequences. In moving at a good pace though it didn't allow much for character development or depth. So while everything was going on, I didn't really care if people were going to be killed off. In regards to the cast, Fassbender was OK, but I didn't find him that believable as an ex-con, especially not one that has to grow a conscience by the end of the film. I don't think he fitted that well for the parts of the film set back in time in central Europe. Saying that though, he wasn't terrible - but I don't think this is one of his strongest rolls. Marion Cotillard doesn't ignite things enough to be a thrill-a-minute, but she's adequate for the fairly emotionless scientist she's meant to portray. Jeremy Irons on the other hand, well he does know how to play a villain quite well, and he absolutely fitted his role. Nice locations, with some nice action and some exciting parkour sequences. I'd give this a 7 out of 10."

" A Confusing Mix
",-0.2263,0.2654,2018-06-10 00:00:00,5,"Quite a few movies based on video game cherry pick from the source material to make a film that attracts a wider audience, with the intention to get them to try the games they're based on. They're not going to go into detail in a two hour film in the same way they would a multi faceted video game that wants to keep you coming back for more. 
I'm not sure, based on this film, I'd want to play the games. Here, a large organisation, with massive resources, has developed a device (that wouldn't look out of place in the Matrix series) which can tap into an individuals ancestral memories and project them for all to see, with the intention of finding something those ancestors hid.And it's that split - between current time and past time - that spoiled the movie for me. The scenes with Aguilar are well shot pieces of action; life and death scenarios that puts you in the center of the action, wondering how they're going to escape. The atmospheric eagle swooping shots give this over view of how vast the situations are that these characters exist in.
And then it pauses and the we return to Cal Lynch in the present, with some dialogue about why he's in the situation he's found himself and meeting other subjects of this procedure.
It's like you're watching the game and then watching the person playing the game, resulting in a weakening of the characters, as none really get fleshed out. It's got a decent cast - Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Charlotte Rampling - yet it's the action that takes center stage and none of them really gets to perform. 
I mean, IMDB lists Brendan Gleeson (Joseph Lynch) above Rampling, though if you look away at the wrong moment, you'd probably miss him! A younger version of Joseph - played by his son, Brian Gleeson - gets more lines (though the film does touch on why that happened)."
" Dreary, dull, and full of wasted potential.
",-0.8074,0.635,2018-05-26 00:00:00,3,"I have never loved the Assassin's Creed games despite the fact that I have always wanted to. I love the ideas. I love the settings. I even love some of the characters. But the gameplay has never gripped me. Yet I was willing to give the film a chance hoping that perhaps the film could present the ideas, settings, and characters I enjoyed in a format I would find more palatable. Sadly the film does not succeed at this task.The most immediate failure of the film is that it focuses on the part of the game that even ardent fans of the series loathe: The ponderous future segments. The appeal of Assassin's Creed has always been the segments set far in the past. In the games, players are constantly rubbing shoulders with famous historical figures, climbing beautiful world wonders, and looking on in awe as the past is brought to life before their very eyes. The segments set in the future were nothing more than a framing device. An excuse to send players back into the past and to explain away the idiosyncrasies that interactive narratives create. They were never the focus and there was a good reason later games in the series diminished the presence of these segments.Yet the film chooses to stay in the future and barely acknowledge the past. It doesn't help that almost everyone in the film is a non-character. Yet we know even less about the assassin Aguilar then we do Callum Lynch. This is an absolute waste of a rich setting: the Spanish inquisition. We never get to see the horrors of this era (Then again, this IS a PG-13 movie... based on a firmly M rated game. Go figure.) nor do we ever get a compelling villain despite there being plenty of real life villains to choose from. Instead we get a boring corporate suit as our villain.It does not help that the film is utterly dreary. While the games may have been largely serious in their tone they chose to create beautiful, vibrant, colorful worlds and actually made an attempt to add in humor, charm, and actual character. Instead the film opts for a grim, bleak aesthetic full of shaky-cam and brown hues that makes an already boring film just as bland visually as it is narratively.And it is all such a shame. There is so much they could have done with this setting. There is so much they could have done with this cast. I'll even argue that some of the action scenes aren't half bad; there was an attempt to make them appear very much like the games - you see Assassin's leaping across roof-tops and fighting with their badass hidden blades in ways that are immediately reminiscent of the games. At the very least you get the impression that if anyone cared about this project, it was the choreographers. It does not matter if you are a fan or merely a casual observer, I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It is not the worst video game movie I have seen but is arguably one of the most boring and uninteresting."

" Disappointing and muddled tosh
",-0.4939,0.4334,2018-05-15 00:00:00,6,"Young Callum Lynch's father kills his mother. As an adult, Cal is executed for murder, following which a secret organisation recruits/kidnaps him because he is a genetic descendant of Aguilar, a Spanish assassin from the 16th century. The Assassins' Guild has been at war with the Templars for centuries over the Eden Apple - the Templars want to use it to remove free will to stop violence, the Assassins want to stop the Templars, and Cal can be regressed to Aguilar who was the last person known to have been in possession of the Eden Apple.That is actually a halfway decent concept on which to base a story. So it's a shame that the film delivers it in a fairly muddled and inconsequential fashion. The action sequences, whether in the present-day facility where Cal finds himself, or in medieval Spain, are well staged if not always completely clear - the special effect which shows Cal fighting while attached to the Animus (the doodad which facilitates the regression) interfaced with the actual combat involving Aguilar is more distracting than effective.The colour palette, as is the fashion, is drab and desaturated, dull and shadowy. Coupled with the tendency for characters to wear the same thing - pale pastel bodysuits in present-day, hoodies in Spain - it isn't always easy to tell who is who. And, even when you can tell, so what? Aguilar does a great deal of running, jumping, and fighting with a young woman who he obviously cares about but, as we never find out who she is or what their relationship is (other than that they are both Assassins), why should we care? Cal is given little by way of background, the nature of the Eden Apple and how it works is vague - it turns out that it emits a greenish light and vapour which doesn't appear to have any immediate effect, which is puzzling given that it is supposedly a DNA map - the identities and driving forces for a lot of the characters are touched on fleetingly at best and, as the film finishes, you are left with a bucketful of unanswered questions (was Callum actually executed or not. for one).The excellent cast is given little to do which a considerably less excellent cast couldn't have done just as well. I suppose their names on the posters put bums on seats.Unless your shopping list has only one thing on it - ""Chase/combat action"" - you are better off watching someone play through the game. As a film, this is a deeply unsatisfying experience.And don't bother with the 3D."

There are 11 full games, and with each of them, people say that the worst aspects of the games were the present day (especially Post-Desmond). So why on earth would you make an Assassins Creed film that focussed 75%+ of it on the present day? It honestly baffles me. The characters were forgettable, especially the 'past' characters. The story was boring. The script was terrible. The only redeeming thing was that the end scene was okay. As a film fan, I was disappointed. As an Assassins Creed fan, I was horrified."

The modern day architecture and interior design of the research and 'rehabilitation' facility is futuristic and clean, contrasting very well with the beautiful and detailed scenes of Spain in 1452. There isn't a lot of verbal interaction between characters but it's succinct and acted well. Costumes are great. The whole film feels like a piece of carefully-constructed art. I enjoyed it and look forward to a sequel, though I don't think it needs one. Never played an Assassin's Creed game so I can't make a comparison, but I'm glad I was able to better judge the film on its own merits without feeling let down because they didn't include X character or premise."
" Nothing to say... it's bad.
",-0.5423,-0.9885,2018-03-21 00:00:00,2,"Video games are challenging to adapt, which is why they never turn out well. While Assassin's Creed may have been good for a TV show, a series as long and complex as this is not fit for a 2-hour movie on the big screen. No one expected this to be good, but I did not expect this to be this bad. Here, it switches between the present day and the Spanish Inquisition, much like how the games move between time periods. However, in the games, the player will spend the majority of the time in the past, rather than in the present. The movie does quite the opposite. While we could be seeing Agular's adventures in the Spanish Inquisition, they opt for an extremely dull story involving the Templar's quest for the Apple of Eden in the present day and the psychological effects of using the Animus. While those would be a pair of interesting episodes in a TV show, we want it to be about the Assassins, not the Templars in the present day. It also doesn't help that none of the characters in this movie are memorable in the slightest. The main character is this death row inmate who gets shipped to Abstergo, who try to use his lineage to find the Apple of Eden. There's also this really boring side plot about the leader of the Templars and his daughter, which is neither interesting nor memorable. The movie's color scheme is terrible. The whole dang movie is varying shades of brown and gray. Some of the scenes in Spain look cool, but for the most part, it's just the same two colors. It's very unappealing to look at. Even the stuff that's actually in the games was done horribly. They even found a way to screw up the Leap of Faith, which I didn't even think was possible. The ending was remarkably stupid, which is especially bad when one considers that this movie is in fact part of the Assassin's Creed canon. All in all, it's just another entry in the list of failed game-to-movie adaptations.Oh, and by the way, Michael Fassbender sings in this movie. You can't make that up."

All that star power, and Assassin's Creed still didn't serve the light.This movie, quite simply, is boring. It really does come from a good place though; the Sci-Fi aspect of your genetic code and lineage linking you to the past. The political and sociopolitical themes that actually do define an important section of the current state of affairs. The action cutting back and forth from Aguilar to Cal, while the VFX brought imagery of Aguilar's past to Cal's present. Honestly, nice ideas and concepts... But the execution is the movie being the assassin, rather than being about them.Then you have Sofia pissing on Cal and calling it rain, saying that place wasn't a prison, meanwhile it was busy looking like a prison, feeling like a prison and operating like a prison, for it to ultimately turn out, to be a prison.Next, you have all the other, assassins? That place was filled with assassins right?! Anyway, you have all those guys who I asked myself; ""Why don't these people just break out, because, don't they kick ass? Maybe they don't, because I mean, why else would they be cooped up there against their will"", imprisoned just to find out that wait, they do kick ass, they can kick ass, and they did kick ass... Only after forever.Also the scene where Moussa and Cal are talking, and having a conversation that left Cal just as lost as the rest of us, being what it was, with all those other prisoners giving him bad looks... Then later one fights him, just to later have them all on his side, after he did what they were afraid he'd do, though apparently, they could've actually stopped it from happening, as they demonstrated at a point when it was too late.And I imagine Moussa calling Cal, ""Pioneer"", is a nod to the game? Yes, I've never played the game, which maybe explains why this film seemed somewhat messy and incomplete to me, but if this movie was done well, I feel like I wouldn't feel this way. 5/10.P.S. Quick nitpick: If Cal was synchronizing, how was he able to do the full somersault's Aguilar was doing, while being attached to a solid part of The Machine/Animus?"

I'm not a fan of the game series, but I always give films a chance. Oh Luke, you never learn. Not sure how to even explain the story, it was that much of a mess. Essentially a murderer, who has descendants that are part of a creed of Assassins during the Spanish Inquisition, must synchronise with a machine that allows him to retrace memories of his ancestor. This is so that an organisation, in which the boss is part of the Templars, can find the Apple of Eden. I'm not going to bore you anymore, because frankly after watching this I myself have become bored. This really was an underdeveloped mess. The story makes no sense. I was questioning to myself (on multiple occasions) ""what the heck is going on!?"". The motives of every character were absurdly shady and ambiguous that I didn't care for them. The final act was so mind numbingly tedious that I felt myself saying ""...I don't even care anymore. Everyone just kill yourselves so I can go to bed. Thanks!"". It's just messy. The editing was horrendous, just full of quick cuts constantly. The action was very hard to follow occasionally due to the rapid cuts. Then add the overabundance of dust, weird bright lighting and hooded attire...*sigh* congratulations, you have made action boring and nonsensical. The cast was unusual. Not to say they were bad, in fact all of them did the best they could with what they were given. Fassbender physically was excellent and tried to add some emotional depth. Cotillard was miscast. Gleeson wasn't even used. Irons was the typical menacing antagonist as always. Such a talented cast that were let down by lazy script writing. The fight choreography was well performed (from what I could see) and I loved the long swooping takes that follow the eagle. Really gives a sense of grandeur that the landscape provides.

" A Nice Fantasy Movie
",0.4215,0.9433,2018-02-23 00:00:00,6,"I've never played the video game for which this movie is based. I thought the plot was interesting and the characters were fun. The stunts are magnificent and the lack of CGI was a huge plus. Michael Fassbender did a really nice job as a modern day descendant of a 15th century elite assassin. The tangled science involved in the plot was a bit off-putting to me. Using science to recover memories of a person's ancestor is cool in theory, but the way it was pulled off left me kind of cold about it. I'm a huge history buff about the Templars so seeing them portrayed as evil and aligned with the Spanish Inquisition was a bit disappointing. Still, I like action adventure movies and this fits the bill. The supporting cast is famous (Jeremy Irons, Marion Cotilliard, Charlotte Rampling, etc), but these roles were beneath them. The MacGuffin of looking for the Apple of Eden made me chuckle. It was as if the Grail and Ark of the Convenant had been overplayed so they came up with a new artifact to hunt. I know this might be in the game, but it still came off as a lame. The final third of the movie really picks up and the action sequences were well-done. Again, the lack of CGI here was a huge bonus. I had just watched Wonder Woman the night before and its almost 90% CGI. I don't mind CGI, but when a director is over reliant on it, it shows a lack of vision.Where this movie failed is it needed a tighter script and less ""secrets"" among the characters. I know its a plot device these days to have characters behave a certain way because they know something the audience does not, but it seemed like every character in this movie knew something no one else did and it drove their behavior. It got annoying when everyone started revealing their motives. Cotilliard's character is a prime example as she starts having regrets once the true ramifications of her actions becomes clear to her. I can't imagine what she thought was going to happen other than the eventual outcome. I guess the producers wanted her to be a sympathetic character. She just came across as kind of dimwitted.This is not a classic, but in the video-to-movie genre is was not bad."

To my surprise, however, I must admit that, all in all, this transposition has entertained me a lot, thanks to the excellent choreography that made the action sequences very fun to watch, despite these after a while 'begin to repeat themselves. However, let's say that its main objective, that any Blockbuster or film intended for the great public must set itself and reach, was, in fact, reached.
In addition, the film has a very attractive appearance thanks to the discreet, though not always well contextualized, cinematography and the excellent scenography visibly well cured and realized.
Very good also the soundtrack that supports and helps the rhythm to remain pressing and constant.
Finally, the couple Fassbender-Cotillard, indeed trio if also considered the director Justin Kurzel, works well again, the three had already collaborated in the very good ""Macbeth"" of 2015.
What does not work in the movie? Well everything else, that is the narrative side of the film. In fact, the proposed screenplay is extremely superficial, poorly structured, trivial, with ideas and solutions already used and abused, the characters are not very incisive, with which it is impossible to tighten any kind of emotional bond that can then push the viewer to wait for their return in another chapter, moreover that the dialogues and twists leave a lot to be desired.
So what to say if not well but certainly not very good for this ""Assassin's Creed"" from which I expected worse. I will wait for any news on the sequel with little hype and with the only hope that, if confirmed, be treated better from the narrative point of view, compared to this."
" It's a good movie.
",0.4404,0.9441,2018-01-18 00:00:00,7,"I loved the video game because it was something unique. You had to learn how to blend in, gather information and assassinate. Throughout the first game you have to regain your status in the assassin's guild. You mess up and then your master takes away your title and sends you on these assassination task to regain your status. The entire time your master is telling you that these are bad people and they must die. As you go along you learn that things are not always what they seem to be. The most interesting part for me is how the templars used relegion as a form of control in the game. The game explains how these pieces of Eden have shaped important events in our history and toward the end demonstrates that power. The theme is about people blindly following something or someone without questioning which is ironic for the main character because he does exactly that. We all think we're in the right and sometimes it's to the point of not thinking. 
 So to the movie. I do not think the movie was perfect. I did enjoy it overall. I loved how they portrayed the Animus. I wish the movie would have stayed 90 percent in the past. I wanted the manipulation of relegion to have been in there it wasn't a theme at all and to me it's important to what assassin's Creed is. I wanted people to see the power of the apple and show why it's so important as well as letting people know there exist other artifacts that hold other powers. That's another reason why assassin's Creed was so awesome to me. You begin to learn that throughout history people had these life changing artifacts that manipulated the path for humans. I do recommend this movie."

The soundtrack is very pleasing, but that's all this film has going for it. It took me three days... THREE DAYS... to get through this whole movie. And that's saying something, because Assassin's Creed wasn't even two hours long. The special effects are beyond cheap. Not just that, this film in general looks awful! It's like a high-budgeted fan film. The acting, if you can even call it acting, is more wooden than a tree.

Good things – the leading actors are all well known and capable. The fact that this film is still pretty dull essentially means that even Michael Fassberger, Jeremy Irons, and Marion Cotillard could not save this movie. I will give them full marks for trying, however. Acting was about the only thing I felt worked here. The production was visually appealing, I suppose, but all of this paled in the face of the utterly ridiculous plot. I love fantasy, and I am quite happy to suspend disbelief and enjoy a good yarn. But this plot just got beyond the whole suspension of disbelief and went happily into ridiculous from the start. What is this machine they are using? How was it made? How could such a thing be remotely possible? No attempted explanation was given, it was just there as a plot device. How could a machine possibly put you into a past life, just because an ancestor had similar dna. How can the other people possibly be seeing the things the hooked up person is seeing? And the 'apple' – the million dollar question is this- if the apple removes free will, how are the Templars going to protect themselves from having their free will removed so they can control everybody else? So many questions, no answers. I am firmly of the belief that if you are going to present a fantasy, it needs to be logical within its own universe. This wasn't."

I went to see the movie based on the strength of a good actor like Fassbender, Irons and Rampling. Th story took too much time to get airborne, and in that time there were a lot of things not explained. Maybe the video game does explain but the movie did'nt. For instance the Cal is to be executed because he killed a pimp. No explanation was given as to why he did that. When he is given the so called deadly injection....why did the prison hand over the body to the foundation? All the action is taken place in Madrid, yet when Sofia and her father go to London, Cal and his friends are there. How the hell did they manage to do THAT with no passports and money. And why would the Templers let these people in without passes. The whole story is a mess from the start. The fighting sequences are good but they do not make up for the story line. Finally the apple was given to Christopher Columbus 500 years previous, and he kept this all his life and was buried with it??? come on give me a break.

",0.0,-0.9677,2017-11-14 00:00:00,1,"First, let's start with the elephant, the story of Eden NEVER called it an apple. It was the forbidden fruit, only modern tellings turned it into a frick'n apple. Second, that thing looks fake as sh**! Nothing remotely like fruit, like something from a factory. I never played the video games but what I know of the games, the Knights Templar an the Church was never the main antagonists. The Di Vinci Code never got to this level of God bashing. Too much time was devoted to the modern parts of the story, the fact that Cal didn't totally refuse to do they're little experiment. Besides, if the fruit gave us free will, then how did we have the free will to defy god to eat to begin with. So, story makes sense, the bad editing in the fight scenes. Lastly, dumbing a game rated M for violence and blood to a PG-13 with a lack of blood for a wider audience to make money only cost them to lose money in the long run. This is a post Deadpool world, what moron can't see staying R would still make money. I was hoping this video game movie would break the streak of bad video game movies. They had built in stories they could have adapted to no gamers but they f***ed it up badly. There is a page saying ""Assassin's Creed 2"" is in development. But this first movie lost so much money, I can't believe the studio has canceled it."
" Blew my mind
",0.0,-0.9896,2017-11-12 00:00:00,5,"I didn't believe the negative reviews before I saw this film, I thought: a film with Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, how bad can it be?  as it turns out, it can be pretty awful.First, the script. The story line is extremely simple: the whole movie mostly took place in 4 places - a research facility in modern Madrid, an unknown village, Sultan Muhammad XII's palace in 15th century Spain, and final scenes in a Church in London. The Creed and Knights Templar were fighting for the ""Apple"" which contains some sort of codes that can control mankind free will (never explained how). The director never bother to give a bit background, or build up the suspense. In fact, there wasn't any suspension, tension, eye-opening moment at all. A lot of the script simply doesn't make sense: like how a group of Creed brothers (supposed prisoners at the facility) could roam around freely, also had easy access to weapons, or how the Knights Templars (who are apparently just a bunch of elderly) did not anticipate the Creed to counter attack after they lost possession of the ""Apple"", etc. Also, for no good reason, the Creed brothers seemed to have developed a habit to climb on top of a building (any building), stood still for a while gazing at the skyline  then jumped off. Can't they just take a subway back to their cavern? Wouldn't that be faster, safer and easier?Second, the fighting and CGI - I can get pass the stupid story line, because I am just in for the entertainment. In that sense, the film failed miserably. The fighting sequences were purely boring to say the very least, most of them involving Michael Fassbender fighting an overhead projector & non-existent ghosts half naked (not kidding). None of the actors look like they had any sort of martial arts training, the result – the fighting scenes looked comical, except they weren't meant to be funny. A good action film, like John Wick, would be at least 10 categories ahead. There was no beautiful cinematography, cringing blood battle, graphic violence. I mean, this is the Creed for assassins, is it not? You'd expect the fighting & killings be more brutal, more realistic. I don't know if Kurzel is just bad at action scenes, or didn't bother putting in at least some basic effort.The whole film felt flat. At no point you can identify with the main characters, it's boring, dreadful, and 2 hours way too long."
" Assassin's Creed Review.
",0.0,0.9726,2017-11-10 00:00:00,6,"Based on the hugely popular Ubisoft video games (of which i'm a fan), Assassin's Creed sees Michael Fassbender star as Callum Lynch a man that has been sent to death for murdering a pimp. After being sentenced to death he wakes up at Abstergo, a mysterious corporation that uses his DNA to access his ancestors memories in the attempt to locate the Apple of Eden. The apple is a device which has the ability to control people's free will. He's thus sent back to 15th century Spain using his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha's memories, an assassin who's pledged his life to guard the artefact.This film really should've been called Assassin's Sweeps, seriously I don't think I've seen a film with as many camera sweeps as this film has. It really started to bug me after the first 20 minutes. In some ways Assassin's Creed is the perfect adaptation, because just like its video game counterpart it's filled with so much potential, but it's never fully realised. This film suffers the same issues the game also does, where everything inside the Animus with Aguilar's memories is excellent and intriguing. However in the current timeline the characters and story are un-interesting. Every time the film cut back to it, I wanted it to return to the Spanish setting.Where this film struggles is in the writing. It's clear that this film was made for fans of the video game, which is fine. However I felt like they didn't do a good enough job explaining the lore and the rules of the world for those that have no idea about the game series. Another minor issue I had with the film is the characters felt very generic, they're all given typically clichéd backstories, and for such a stellar cast it was a missed opportunity to give the film some much needed depth.For a video game adaptation the film is competently well made. The cinematography and costume/set design all look and feel authentic in the 15th century setting. Justin Kurzel does a good job directing the action scenes, they're fluid and the shaky cam isn't as extreme in other films of this ilk, which makes for a more engaging experience. The first act of the film is clearly the weakest as the film is trying to shove tons of exposition down the audience's throats and the editing is poorly constructed. Thankfully from the first Animus set-piece the film manages to find it's footing and becomes more confident and sure of itself.Michael Fassbender gives a typically committed performance in his dual role, and he keeps the film grounded on the right track when the plot starts to become questionable. Jeremy Irons, Charlotte Rampling and Marion Cotillard all give a decent if somewhat unremarkable job in their roles. In the end Assassin's Creed could've been a better film if they kept the focus on the Spanish Inquisition rather than the modern day storyline, I think one more pass on the script to tighten up the loose plot threads would of made the film more accessible to general audiences. However despite all the problems the film has, it's easily one of the best video game to film adaptations made thus far, take from that what you will."

In the beginning the movie seemed like it might be fun and interesting. So far so good. As the story progressed, the plot seemed to jump the track and scatter. It was like the story-line split into a multitude of story-streams, each aimlessly meandering on its own little path. It didn't take long for me to lose interest. With all the naps I took, I couldn't figure out what the story was to save my life, and I am sure as heck not going to sit through another viewing. Not to worry though, I think I know the tale anyways - and here is my best guess: (Spoiler Alert) Don't read if you really want to waste your money and time. (Spoiler alert), (Spoiler alert) a murderer gets executed, comes back to life, kills a bunch more people, is viewed as a hero, and lives happily ever after on some roof-top in London. That's it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, its awful. The story is weak, the directing is nonexistent and the cast was slightly better than mediocre. Admittedly, I'm no fan of Michael Fassbender, I think he is overrated; Jeremy Irons wasted his time and talent, and Marion Cotillard is someone I'm not familiar with."

As Callum swims back to the surface (and back to reality) he finally realizes who the Templars are in the Present. And when Callum's ancestors assemble around him, as he's making his recovery to the Present, it's like they are giving him permission to carry on with the Creed's mission in the Present. At an hour and a half into the movie, it feels like a completely new movie started. Genius movie making. They incorporated the game's story line to a T, and even built upon it to make it better. This movie left me wanting a sequel, much like the games always did. The critics who publish movie ratings just don't get it because they probably have never played the entire Assassin's Creed game story line. I thought it was brilliant."

Though this is a thing in the games, it functions there are a brief respite from the intensity of the assassin sequences by letting you nudge along the present-day plot with Desmond.The notion of the clandestine capture of multiple people to find the Apple of Eden is inconsistent with the game, and the film doesn't do enough to help the viewer to understand the Apple's purpose beyond broad strokes.The character development is also weak; why is Cal a death row inmate, of all things? There were numerous other ways of tackling the entry of Cal into the clandestine organization as opposed to what actually happened. Sophia and her father are also not utilized as well as possible, and this is truly unfortunate because these three actors are known for great performances; Michael Fassbender made Magneto, a genocidal maniac, sympathetic for crying out loud, so you must know that your writing has failed if his gravitas doesn't land. Cal is not interesting, and has positively nothing going for him. His game counterpart, Desmond, isn't much better, but Cal had the chance, in the dimension of film, to be something more, but he was not in the end.There are some fun stunts, and a few moments of solid action, but the film doesn't commit itself well enough to be an effective piece of cinema. I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition to fall quite so flat. Monty Python is not pleased."

This reminds me of a combination between ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" for some of the special effects, and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman's character) from the X-Men movies, similar to the way Michael Fassbender's character uses daggers to thwart his competitors while he's in a time-warp ""Limbo"", trying to figure out who he is and why he's in the position he's at during his interplay with Marion Cotillard (the daughter of Jeremy Irons' character). The whole point is to discover the original ""Apple"" from the Garden of Eden that gave Original Humanity the chance at immortal Life, and knowledge of how to live that life... if, and only if, it's passed on by descendants of the original Generations. The movie seamlessly moves between the past and modern times with a very clever device, that allows you to imagine what HG Wells created, when he thought of the ""Time Machine""...because that was the first thing I thought of when Michael Fassbender weaves himself between the past and the present. Wouldn't it be nice if we could all really do that? I'm not sure exactly what it says about Society and the fascination to want to either go back and change things in the past, or be able to predict the future in ways that control who and what we are... in terms of personal choice, political motivations, and the middle ground between those two. I became lost in this lovely Phantasm of time and space, while I lost myself during the viewing of this film... And loved every minute, or just about.

Even though it was probably his worst performance, he kept me glued throughout the movie, and at least gave a false hope that everything will get better. Bad : Michael Fassbender is taken in a quest of revisiting the memories of his great (raised to power 18) grandfather using the weirdest and the most absurd things, which are too absurd even for the needlessly absurd movies like this. Plus, after all that dance offs or action sequences or whatever there is a least interesting build up to the least interesting twist. Probably, the makers thought the best way to utilize the CGI was to create dust sequences and that annoying bird. The action sequences were too boring. It tried to be a ""historical epic"" of some kind and failed every bit. And, those spirits crossing over were something that the movie didn't try to explain. And whatever happens towards the end is plain vague. The most nonsensical part. It feels like as if Michael Fassbender did this movie because he (as Magneto) couldn't travel back in time in X-Men: Days of Future Past. This is the one of the worst ""quest for something"", epic and sort of time travel film ever made."
" Very fun action flick
",0.5563,0.9843,2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed this film. I'm glad I did not look at the rating before watching it because I may have skipped it.Fun. Great FX. Great fight scenes. I liked the basic premise.The acting was good. The directing was good.Fassbender's character was interesting and true. Good acting too.I was never bored.Why so many complaints? I was pleasantly surprised. A fun Friday or Saturday night flick.
" Better constructed than the games
",0.4404,0.8778,2017-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Assassins Creed is a really good movie. It actually manages to tell a coherent story, which the games absolutely do not. Any fanboy that took to the internet crying, ""Why don't they just make the games!? My hopes were so high; Hollywood is filled with stupid!"" -- those people don't know anything about storytelling. I've played all the games, and I can tell you Ubisoft (the game publisher) doesn't know anything about storytelling either. In fact, they blatantly threw the story out after the first game in the name of profits, which explains why there are ten games -- yes TEN GAMES -- that are, at best, an insult to storytelling. They are confusing and barely tied together into one universe... Ubisoft itself probably can't explain them to anyone. I don't understand why everyone hates this movie so much. The critics seem to hate it because it dared be based off a video game, and the fanboys are just crazy people who will never admit the games don't make any sense or even come close to telling a cohesive story. The movie has a solid plot that moves at a decent pace. The action sequences are well choreographed and filmed with a deft hand. I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe it's the most intelligible story we can ever hope to get out of the Assassin's Creed ""universe."" Stick your nose up at it if you will, but that's why we can't have nice things/movies of creations we love. Everyone is being petty and overly critical."

Cal doesn't fight anyone nor do anything adventurous; instead, he thinks/remembers stuff that some total stranger went through. Cal is in a lab the whole time. Sorry, but any movie where a character ""sees"" things only in his mind while it's not truly happening to him is a dud. Second, I know all religions are meant to be equally corrupt in this film, but why are the Muslims who invaded Spain the good guys here, and the Templar monks who try to recapture Spain from the Muslims are bad? I guess the filmmakers thought that enemies have the right to invade your land, and anyone who fights back is a villain. Also, the father-daughter team is after a religious relic called the Apple. So it's okay for THEM to conduct unwilling human experiments in order to find the Apple, but when the Templars try to get that same relic from the Muslims who stole it, then the Templars are the bad guys? The film , and the video games, would be 1000 times better if you eliminated the modern drug/lab stuff. Just make a movie about a secret society who is chasing after a religious relic instead of a movie about a man who remembers his ancestor chasing after a religious relic."

" Your blood is not your own
",0.0,-0.7319,2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"Disclaimer: I haven't played the game.The film starts off with an introduction for us newbies. The Knights Templar are the bad guys and the Assassins are the good guys in Orwellian naming fashion. They are fighting over control of the ""Apple of Eden"" which doesn't show any signs of decay or has any bites out of it. Supposedly the seeds of this thing has the genetic code for free will, disobedience, violence etc. Not really something of any real value in 1492 since they couldn't even spell DNA, but they fight over it anyway because the film would be pretty lame if they didn't.In 1492 we are told the Assassin's ""operate in the light"" by wearing dark hoodies and sneaking around. This is later amended in the film to they operate in the shadows for the light which cleared up my light theology conundrum.The film comes to the present where we get a quick background on Callum Lynch, who is not lynched but is killed in Texas for the crime of killing a pimp, although I think they still have the death penalty in Texas for having a seed, man. Anyway, Lynch didn't die and somehow ends up alive in Spain being the experiment of Sofia (Marion Cotillard), not the one from the Dan Brown novel, but inspired by her. There is a huge facility which has a ""genetic memory"" machine which gives both Cal and science a thorough beating. Cal goes back in time in his head to recall his past self to figure out what he did with the apple for about an hour or so, off and on.The sole function of this film is to introduce the character and hopefully set up for a series of films...or at least one more depending on the response of the fan base. Normally films such as these flop and there is no mega million dollar sequel, like Green Lantern and the second Fantastic Four film. Some do great like the Marvel and X-men series. The main problem with the film was that there was too much fighting in 1492 and hardly any in the present. They could have scripted it a different way to make it more palatable for people living in this century.Guide: No sex or nudity. IMDb claims one f-word which I missed."

It was a great world combined with factual and fictional events. Other Instalments were fine. These game series have so much potential to put in work. Great story and characters. But when in turn into movie almost whole universe we knew is gone. Assassin's creed were based mostly on religious atmosphere surrounded with greed and will of power. A dedicated creed to save old knowledge from greedy egos and radical powers try to govern people. It's about stealth, morality of a high skilled killers and them devotion to what they believed. Where all of that gone? This film ruined my hope to bring a strong and famous game into life. Like other attempts did before. But it could be much better. Even the original story of game series could do much better to the fans. It gave it 2 stars only because of my old memories of this universe. N. Azad"

I would give it a full 10 stars, but the only reason I'm not is because it seems that the script was rushed and was in a hurry to be written.

In most of action scenes, the characters hardly hide and assassinate, but fight visibly. I know violent fighting scenes are good for action films but this is Assassin's Creed so I don't want fighting scenes so much.Actually, actions scenes are good. Parkoul, stylish fighting, I enjoyed them but I didn't enjoy all scenes. I don't know why (maybe because the story is not good) but scenes in the facility were boring.So, because actions are good, if this were not Assassin's Creed, this could be better than now I think.

Exiting the cinema I was rather non-plussed, what I got was a rather decent art house film and not the block buster I was expecting.The two main aspects of Assassins Creed are past and present. As a film it gets only the present correct, shots are moody, visuals are interesting and characters interact. In the past visuals are murky, there is little interaction and shockingly no parkour.The narrative is very narrow, there are only two characters with the rest being stereotypes or only showing glimpses of character. Another character dynamic would have improved the films no end. The animus is visually very striking and works for the film. I felt like was watching something that was designed for the small screen and last minute got the OK from above to be upgraded to a film but to late to change the script. Recommended if your looking for a tight little moody film for a winter evening. Not recommended for fans of the game series."

",-0.4019,0.4273,2017-07-21 00:00:00,2,"Assassin's Creed is a brutal movie with a poorly developed plot and a very talented cast that could do so much better. It would be an absolute pleasure to see Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons and Brendan Gleeson all in the same movie together, if that movie was not a lousy adaptation of a video game where 90% is clearly filmed using a green screen and an over abundance of CGI. I have absolutely no issues with their performances, they did their absolute best with chronic dialogue. The characters are extremely two dimensional, I did not care for any of them. Fassbender is a straight up good guy, we learn very little to him beyond that. He is the protagonist, one who has no flaws as a human, making him completely unrelatable. As for Irons, he was simply a villain, absolutely nothing more than that. The best antagonists are the ones who we can emphatise with, the ones who give us enough insight that we can see why they are trying to achieve a certain goal, even if we do not agree with their methods of achieving it. As for Rikkin, he is simply causing evil for the sake of causing evil. This film was definitely not made for me, I am not a fan of, nor have I ever played the video games, but I do not feel like I should have to. It was clear from early on that the whole movie does not make sense unless you already know the lore of the games series, which is simply poor writing. It should have been straight forward enough for new audience members to understand, broadening its horizons, allowing it to be watchable for anyone, instead of restricting its access to people who have played it. Had me taking long blinks throughout. Long, tedious and riddled with flaws, I would not advise anyone to give Assassin's Creed the time of day. Callum Lynch is given the chance to view the world of his ancestor, a master assassin. Best Performance: Jeremy Irons"

But I expected it to be bad, because I've never encountered with a well-made video game based movie ever in my life. But if your movie starts with a text explaining the events which you can establish visually in literally 10 minutes, that means your aim is not making a good movie, hell it's not even making a movie, it's just making a 2 hour advertisement for Ubisoft and upcoming assassin's creed games. Just think about this. How shameless and lazy it is. You're making a movie, but instead telling the story visually, you're writing it on the screen. If this is acceptable, you can even write the whole script and charge the audience like they saw a movie. The action scenes were okay I guess. They were well choreographed, well written(just the action scenes!), but poorly directed."

If I were to stretch I could say the action scenes were good, however they are ruined by terrible editing and over reliance on CGI which makes them impossible to follow. Cotillard, Irons and Fassbender do their best, but the script is total garbage and doesn't even make sense half the time (they have a facility full of former assassins but all the guards have are knives and batons? This could have quite easily been a B movie, buried to a DVD release and never heard from again. Instead it's had millions spent on it, and still sucks. One of the most compelling parts of the assassins creed series is the amazing locations and the references to true historical events. Instead this film makes very little reference to that to the point where you've no real idea what the hell is going on when it shifts to the events in Spain and the scatter gun approach to hazy CGI and almost fanatic devotion to shadowy lighting means there's nothing worthwhile to pay attention to visually either.This could have quite easily been an above average film, or at least a visual spectacle but it doesn't come close to either."

I mean ever since the trend had started from the video games to the big screen, this one was a bit late to come into the party. My guess was, that's the disadvantage. The film fanatics thinks, there are too many graphics films. Besides, they did not pick the right screenplay for it like EA did for 'Need for Speed'.I have never played this game, so I was not expecting it like the others, but I'm surely disappointed with the film. I had no idea about the characters or the universe, it sets in. After watching the film I thought why this game is so famous where I did not find this film any good. Yep, it's not fair to compare two different formats. But the fact will remain that the film was one of the worst among big titles releasing on this year.I thought it was like 'Matrix', but more a periodic style action- adventure. I think the cast was good and the rest of the film was not. What I disliked the most was the smoky visuals. Yes, all the scenes with the ancient Spain was very smoky atmosphere that I had hard time to have a clear picture of what's going on. I hope there won't be any sequel to it, but if they do plan, I expect a miracle that erases all the bad image created by this part. The film is watchable, but not likable or enjoyable.

",0.2579,-0.8689,2017-07-10 00:00:00,2,"As a great fan of the Assassin's creed story, I didn't know what to expect of this movie. Now that I've seen it, I'm frankly disappointed.The first thing to say is I felt lost throughout the movie. Even if you are familiar with the series general story line, the plot of the movie is extremely confusing for many reasons.Let me bring you up to speed for the ones who never played the games. The Apple of Eden is an artifact made by what is known as the First Civilization. In brief they were a very advanced civilization who unfortunately was wiped out when a solar flare struck our planet. Knowing that doom was closed and it may likely happen again in the future, they made the Apple of Eden, a sort of key to open a vault sheltering Minerva, a Goddess who has the power to shield the planet from entire destruction. But as she's evil, the people kept her prisoner leading to their demise. As a new disastrous flare is in motion, the Assassins and the Templars are using the animus to find the Apple, the first to save us all by freeing Minerva, the latter to destroy it so they could start afresh.In this movie however, the Apple of Eden is nothing but a canister which contains the seed of Free Will. So not only they made a big twist to the storyline but in add they didn't even bother to put the entire movie in English.Which brings me to the second point. Why didn't they put the animus part in English so that everyone could understand. I truly hope your Spanish skills aren't rusty because you gonna need them to even understand what they are saying. As if the story line was already hard to understand in English, they had to tell it in a foreign language too! At least in the games, they had the decency to automatically translate the dialogue. Why they didn't do that in the movie? That's a big turn off to me.The cast is prestigious for sure. Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson or Charlotte Rampling are awesome actors but they need a convincing direction to fully achieve their potential. And this is cruelly lacking. None of them have a presence which would make us feel interested about them. They are bland characters, nothing but empty shells. What they say or do is immediately forgotten in the next second. It's so dull it's embarrassing. I don't know why they chose to be a part of this, probably a big check is enough but they should scrap that line from their resume because their performance there is truly forgettable.The last thing I didn't like is how it was shot. Like the entire movie, it seems so confused and it's a torture to watch. All is mixed up you're losing the complete track. Past is meddled in the present and vice versa. How I wish they would do it like in the game. The user lays down, plugs in, is transported back in time and we only see his/her ancestor until the sequence is over. Then the user plugs off and rest, back in our days. It would be so much more enjoyable to see and much less confusing.So to conclude, I would suggest you avoid that movie like a plague, whatever you're a fan of the AC Series or just a newcomer. Thankfully I didn't go to the theater to watch it as I would have probably got sickened for an entire week. I'll give a 2/10 for the cast prestige but that's all I can give. Now let me get some aspirin."

" Gamers, you won't be disappointed.... it's awesome....
",0.0,0.9955,2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"I watched Assassin's Creed on DVD while I was at home. That day I was all alone at home, the TV was next to my bed and I was waiting for a chill Saturday night movie. That was expectation. Reality: I literally pumped my fists high into the air watching this epic!Yes, this movie was a success, it did have a few small problems which I will later state in this review. But first off, let's look at the positives. What made the Assassin's creed games a success was the ability to actually force the environment and the characters into the player and make them live in that time line, and this is also where the movie mostly succeeds.We actually get to experience this as a live saga, as if we feel the atmosphere of corruption and action in each memory sequence, kudos Kurzel, well done. Also, the story touches upon the aspects of modern reality when it comes to the titular character, Callum. We are introduced to this complex character who saw his mother murdered at the hands of his estranged father. Years later, that same character whom we expect some heroism has become a killer, awaiting death row (Bruce Wayne styled revenge plot is not present). This actually deviates Callum from the likes of a well beloved hero, to a man who gives no f*** about his actions. This was actually what made this movie more interesting as Callum literally ascends from a man to a legend within the creed. It was a master move to make Fassbender the protagonist. The action was great, on a scale from 1 to 10, it would get 8.5 for action in a movie, but compared to the game, the fighting and agility of each character is enhanced. This was no surprise (I mean come on, human actors are more flexible than human fingers pressing buttons, no offense to the game though).There was no abundance of weapons but the standard hidden blade got my game senses tingling, not just because it was there but the way it was used in the movie was both nostalgic to gamers and unique to the audience. The costume was realistic (Yay!) But it did differ from game characters like Ezio and Altair. Music was great, on second thought, it was awesome. The present time line also showed a realistic portrayal of how Templars would be operating on present day The actors were really good. Gotta hand it to Kurzel, Fassbender spectacularly delivers Callum's story into the audience through his fantastic acting (Oscar material coming through). Marrion Cotillard was also super awesome for her role, Jeremy Irons was perfect in portraying the manipulative Allan Rikkin and the other characters were great as well. Director Justin Kurzel also stated that the use of Spanish in the past time line was to enrich the tale in historic accuracy, fleshing out an exotic tale. and it did. The characters were also fleshed out as real people fighting a war, rather than superheroes and villains. And now starts the bitter parts. The story was rushed. To me, this was the main fault. They could have actually stretched it out, it was only ninety minutes, we could have actually seen a little bit more. The apple of Eden shouldn't have been acquired by the present day Templars or Assassins, they should have done that in the sequel. Allan Rikkin should have lived. Overall, this was epic. I would definitely watch it again, it got me so hyped (Yes, I'm an Assassin's Creed player) and I hope the sequel comes out not just as a continuation of this story, but also with some more depth."
" Assassinated with Excitement (Almost)
",0.4939,-0.9917,2017-06-30 00:00:00,10,"I'm dead with excitement.This New Year's, I watched Assassin's Creed.(Apologies for my delay in posting the following reaction to it.)I absolutely loved the movie.The film deals with two eventualities: 1) what happens to an individual who does agree to enter into the Animus (a machine designed to take one back into the memories of one's ancestors) of one's own volition, and 2) what happens to an individual who does not. The answer to the second question, an answer we dread to see in the inhabitants of the Abstergo Foundation, is loss of mind and loss of life. The plot also raises a number of philosophical questions, such as: How can free will be the cause of violence, if the will to submit to society's rule is our only hope of social salvation and the will to rebel against it is the one sign of personal meaning? As I see it (and the filmmakers no doubt intended it), to submit to something without choosing to do so is to rob oneself of whatever humanity one has left.Those who dislike violence, history, fantasy or video games really have no reason to see this film. (I've personally watched a close relative be a tad too attracted to all of them.) However, those who appreciate good action, stunning CGI and probing philosophical questions will find it gripping, even enthralling. It is for you that I have written the remainder of this review.Philosophically, the turning point of the film occurs with the following line, addressed from the protagonist Callum Lynch, a criminal descended from the original assassin's creed, to a scientist experimenting on him: ""I'm here to be cured of violence. Who's going to cure you?""At the risk of stating the obvious, allow me to voice the reality they both knew: no one was. In aspiring to find the source of violence for the alleged purpose of studying it in order to destroy it, the descendants of the Templar Order placed their right-to-will above the right-to-freedom of those they sought to subjugate. As the film reveals, these scientists followed the medieval belief of their ancestors that the apple of Eden contained the seeds of violence in the form of free will. Their solution was then ***SPOILER ALERT*** to go back in time in order to retrieve the apple and control if not destroy it.For us, the takeaway is somewhat less mythical but equally mysterious. Evil exists. And the only way to destroy it would seem to be to remove free will itself. The only way to do that? Pretend to be God.Which alternative is more horrifying, I will leave you to tell. But the only way for anyone to survive the waking nightmare that the remnant of life without basic freedoms would be, one must conclude somewhat counter-intuitively, by choice—just as the criminal test-subjects were asked to choose to enter into the simulator Animus to get in touch with the memories of their ancestors.This all goes to say that perhaps the strongest take-away from the film is this: There is no task of submission or pain that can kill your soul, so long as you embrace it of your own free will. But this all sounds a bit too demonic. I think it might be time to read some Viktor Frankl."
" What a mess!
",-0.4199,-0.8873,2017-06-28 00:00:00,4,"Definitely the game fans are not happy with what they are seeing in the movies. Assassin's Creed is not that horrible movie you want to pluck out of your eyes when you see it. But, still bad. The beginning of this is very drawn out with many unnecessary explanations, and breeds speeches and motivations that do not last long. Some scenes are quite no sense, and even the main character seems to be confusing about it. The finale just close the door of the shitness, and bring to us a scene that gets to be funny from so bad. After all, the movie isn't all bad, somewhere in the middle of it I almost enjoy to watch, with some good action scenes, but this does not last 30 minutes. In short, it's a movie that could be very good if explored some aspects of the mythology of the franchise. Sadly, they don't do that, and the movie sucks."
" As unimpressive as the games upon which the movie is based...
",-0.34,0.8873,2017-06-25 00:00:00,5,"I have tried the games, and I haven't been impressed with the monotonous and repetitive gameplay of the franchise, so I was a bit skeptical about sitting down to watch ""Assassin's Creed"". However, I decided to watch it anyway, even though I had been told by several people that it was by no means an impressive movie.So why watch it? Well, mainly because it was a massive Hollywood production after all, and also because it had Michael Fassbender and Jeremy Irons on the cast list.However, even such talents as Fassbenders and Irons were unable to lift up director Justin Kurzel's interpretation of ""Assasin's Creed"". And the end result of the movie was a very bland and disappointing one. So I guess I should have listened to people telling me that this was not worthwhile.The storyline as concocted by writers Michael Lesslie, Adam Cooper and Bill Collage was a very weak one, and it had very little appeal to anyone not a hardcore fan of the numerous games available in the franchise.The characters in ""Assassin's Creed"" were one-dimensional and had very little worth or appeal. All that essentially differed from one character to the next was the gender and face. And it was difficult to take the movie serious with the super-humanly abilities of the assassins that served the brotherhood. And when they were running across the narrow streets on clotheslines between buildings, then I was ready to get up and just drop the movie entirely. That was some of the most ridiculous stuff I have seen in a long, long time.The dialogue in the movie wasn't particularly impressive, and having staggering and silly dialogue as presented in the movie just didn't promote a limited storyline in any way.This was a movie that was watchable solely because of the impressive special effects and visual effects that was used to bring the story to life on the screen. And as such, it was a very hollow type of entertainment, because visuals can only do so much for a movie.While ""Assassin's Creed"" does have some good names to the cast list, it was clear that the cast were impeded by a very limited script and storyline. The acting performances in the movie were by no means outstanding or memorable.I have managed to sit through the entire movie, and I wasn't impressed. And I can honestly say that ""Assassin's Creed"" is not a movie that will make it on my screen a second time around. It just had no value to sustain more than a single viewing."
" Visually Stunning, as you would expect (Small irrelevant spoiler)
",0.3818,0.9623,2017-06-23 00:00:00,7,"So, Assassins Creed (the game) revolutionized what we (gamers) considered amazing graphics, the graphics in that game for the console it was on were so beyond their years I did expect the graphics for the film to be sublime. The filmed showed amazing depth and really wows visually !! Although you don't get breathtaking views from a location, and you can tell it was filmed in a studio. (Small Spoiler) The way they added layers on top of some of the scenes was great.The story was good however I feel you would benefit from checking quickly what the games about before watching the film just so you get more from watching it and potentially a better viewing experience. In a two hour film the explanation was not great however I feel the conviction was good. (You can watch and follow without reading up just a bit better I personally believe) All in all great visually, good story, good fight scenes and ended really well.Only down points did not appreciate filming from a Hollywood studio as I believe you loose allot !! And then also the assassins looked weak for me personally, showing visibly out of breath after a 5 min free run for me was not what I wanted to see. And then also they were epic in the fight scenes, and then the ratios they were up against showed their ability, however I still did not get the one way fight scenes I have you have become accustomed to with the likes of Batman, Wonder Woman and such where the better fighter truly looks better. I know he's an assassin and not a superman but in the games you feel invincible in the film he seemed venerable."
" Horrible
",-0.5423,0.6715,2017-06-23 00:00:00,2,"As a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed video games, I was actually expecting something really good to come from this movie. It certainly had the potential to become one of the best video game movie adaptations because it looked very promising. So, as I went to the movie theaters with high expectations, I expected it to be a movie worthy of a 7 or of an 8. However, when I actually did watch the movie myself, I was totally disappointed. Assassin's Creed was an absolute abomination of a movie. Everything about it was terrible. It had a terrible story because all it had was action here and there... And the scenes without the action were extremely dull... So dull in fact, the only thing I could recall from the movie were its action scenes. The characters on the other hand, are barely fleshed out. We get to know nothing about them. The only character that even seemed that important to me was probably the main character himself. Because of a lack of explanation of the story, and the uninteresting characters whom we barely knew about, Assassin's Creed ended up becoming another terrible video game movie adaptation. And don't even forget about the ending. It was probably one of the most confusing endings I've ever seen in all of my years of watching movies."
" A Beautiful looking but unforgivably poorly put together madhouse.
",0.3506,0.882,2017-06-22 00:00:00,5,"Despite Assassin's Creed's negative reception I felt it was important to give the film a chance without leaning too much on word of mouth. With a team like Justin Kurzel, Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, and Jeremy Irons, one would think this video game to movie adaptation will succeed. Unfortunately, it's just not good at all. As a film itself, it fails on the most important narrative fronts including incoherent plot, underdeveloped characters, and lack of clear vision for what the film can or should do. First though, it's important to get a few positives out there first. Mainly this film looks fantastic! Nearly every frame of the film is shot like a beautiful piece of art credit is deserving to the cinematographer. The style of the movie itself (which I would generally lend to the director) feels consistent with what Assassin's Creed should be and the cast give solid performances. Not great but solid.Leaving visuals and action sequences aside. The film fails narrativley for the reasons listed above. Somewhere in the movie is a good movie with a reason as to why they made it and interesting questions about aggression, violence, and right/wrong. Unfortunately the film doesn't attempt to take on any of these themes in a memorable way. Near the 3rd act the story might flirt with that line of potentially thought-provoking but it never becomes enthralling to watch. Half the characters feel like they could've been completely cut from the plot and a new story written altogether could have saved some of this mess. Walking out of the movie the complaints tend to outweigh the positives to the movie and I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone except for fans of the games. True fans of the games will find more to praise about it including lore, style, and action. Narratively speaking, it's not a good one but it's not the worst you've ever seen. Rather just skip it to be safe."
" No upgrades for you
",-0.296,0.8574,2017-06-22 00:00:00,5,"Apart from the action part, the first Assassins Creed games did have a lot of story and a lot you could tell in a movie. So it did seem like a good idea (especially visually) to go for it. And Michael Fassbender might not have been my first choice (though he is an amazing actor and I personally don't blame him), but this is what we get.The story is not really great either, we get a father-son thing and some other clichés thrown our way, but nothing really sticks. So the effects do their trick, but that's about it. Other characters are thrown into the mix and the movie tries to do something, but you're better off playing the games. Or watching a compilation of the cut-scenes from the games that surely someone has made available."
" Assassins creed lover
",0.5859,0.9213,2017-06-19 00:00:00,1,"I'm a huge assassins creed fan, mainly the first 4-5 games. The Desmond story was amazing and unique and paired with the Etzio trilogy was amazing, I always thought they'd bring out a film and as it's such a unique story it'd be a top 100 IMDb hit! How wrong was I?! This movie was possibly the worst film I've ever watched in a cinema. The story was just terrible, I was honestly speechless at the end that ANYONE who had anything to do with the film would let that be made and released, if I was on the team id have watched it before release and have said 'what on earth have we done'. Ubisoft should sell assassins creed to a gaming developer that will do the series justice, and that film should be forgotten as soon as possible and re done with new actors and be made into the masterpiece it should be!"
" Good Action Scenes but Story Needs Work

The score composed for the action scenes are poor, and add no real depth other than ""cool action stuff."" The story wasn't bad however it feels messy like they were trying to compile a story quickly and just be done with it. None of the ""twists"" were surprising and overall this movie is just an enjoyable action film with no real substance."

",0.6696,0.9502,2017-06-11 00:00:00,8,"I've played all the assassin's creed games and they only thing that I disliked about this movie was the lack of weapons used by the assassin's in the movie. In the video games, the assassin's always have some type of sword, plus multiple other weapons at their disposal. As for the plot, I thought the director did a pretty good job. I mean it's not exactly like the video games but the portrayal of the assassin's and their environment is spot on to me, and it was really awesome to see one of my favorite video games on the big screen. Some of these people writing these reviews are idiots! Most of them probably have never played the video game, or have even heard of assassin's creed! They just watched the movie because the trailers looked cool!"
" Incredibly bad.
",-0.5849,-0.8352,2017-06-09 00:00:00,1,"This is a staggeringly bad movie. It's rare to find a movie that misses every trick. Whether that's adherence to source material, color palette, dialogue, or ostensibly joyful things, like choreography, or soundtrack - usually, *usually*, even a really bad movie gets something right. This, though, is such a limping effort I can't recall a single piece of the puzzle being laid down correctly. Even Michael Fassbender's legion of tiny, enchanting teeth couldn't instill this disaster with any charm. That this movie made as much money as it did, and carries the rating it does, feels like an indictment of film-making and the industry as a whole - there are periods of the year where there are so few options in major cinemas, that the movie-inclined individual is sometimes forced to settle for trash like this. And untroubled, sometimes for months, by any competition made with any care at all, one can even leave the theater thinking 'huh, that wasn't *so* bad.'But it was. This isn't a good review. There isn't any way to defend or criticize this film. Everyone performed like they'd just run in from the rain, and were in the wrong shop. There is no reason for anyone doing anything, no sense of purpose for any characters - just a hastily constructed, looming sense of destiny, present mostly out of a sense of expectation, rather than because anything in the plot argued for it to be there. I recommend that everyone avoid this movie. That goes double for anyone who loves the franchise."
" How could a film with so much talent and potential fall so flat?
",0.4728,0.8712,2017-05-29 00:00:00,3,"Just for the record, to anybody saying that critics and fans watched 'Assassin's Creed' wanting to hate it that is an unfounded accusation and to me has very little truth to it.Saying that says more about the person saying it, further proof that many people on this site have the inability to know the difference between fact and opinion and have to resort to personal attacks and conspiracy theories, which is not just childish but incredibly ignorant too. The ""hate"" actually comes from people who saw a lot of potential with the premise, which was a very interesting one, and was drawn in by the talent. It is the same as saying that it is cool to hate on films based on video games, people have acknowledged that not all of them are bad and there are decent ones out there, but there are some very bad ones too that it is understandable why they have a bad reputation.'Assassin's Creed' is not quite down there with the worst films based on arcade/video games. It's better than the likes of 'House of the Dead', 'Doom' and 'Street Fighter', but considering the potential and talent it was a huge waste. Have not played the video games in a while but there is a recollection of them being a lot of fun and having a lot of intrigue value, the film doesn't come close to recreating that or immersing the viewer into the richly textured world or make one care for the characters.There are strengths here. On the most part, 'Assassin's Creed' looks great, it's often beautifully and atmospherically shot and the scenery is magnificently majestic. Some of the action is dynamic and exciting, as well as efficiently choreographed. The cast generally are not well used and all have done much better.However, Michael Fassbender is an enigmatic lead and Jeremy Irons makes much of relatively little and it shows his adeptness at playing villains (a prime example being Scar in 'The Lion King', one of the best voiced villains in the whole Disney canon).Marion Cotillard has very little to do with poor dialogue and a severely underwritten character with no depth whatsoever, and she struggles to do anything with them. A waste of a very good actress. Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson are woefully underused, particularly Gleeson whose character is basically a plot device that could easily have been written out and nobody would have noticed.In all fairness, it is hard to do much with what little they were given when the characters are so sketchily written and developed (little more than shallow clichés) and the script being the complete mess it turned out to be with so much being so vague and over-complicated it comes over as confused.Story is not much better. It is both thin and tries to do far too much, also taking itself too seriously with a dark and bleak tone that just doesn't gel often. Pacing issues are abound, with scenes suffering from real tedium. Some of the editing in the action sequences is so shoddy it's almost incoherent. The music is monotone and intrusive and the direction is all over the place.In conclusion, falls completely flat and does very little with its talent and potential which is one of the worst things a film can commit. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
" a dull muddle
",-0.4019,0.7543,2017-05-28 00:00:00,3,"The Abstergo Foundation fakes the execution of Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) and recruits him into a secret program run by CEO Alan Rikkin (Jeremy Irons) and his daughter Sofia (Marion Cotillard). They are able to send him into the mind of his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha in 1492 Spain. Aguilar and Maria are part of Assassin's Creed trying to rescue prince Ahmed from Templar Grand Master Tomas de Torquemada who wants the Apple of Eden from Sultan Muhammad XII in Granada which is the key to enslaving humanity. Ellen Kaye (Charlotte Rampling) is a leader of present day Templars who is calling for an end to funding Rikkin's program.The story telling is a muddle with some questionable logic. The other problem is that the modern day bunker location is dull with plenty of dull expositions. The action scenes especially the ones in the past are pretty interesting. For some reason, it is intercut with Callum in present day Animus. It attempts to be cool but it muddles the action sequences instead. It's better to do the action straight. Despite the Spanish dialog and subtitles, the past holds an intriguing look and the movie needs to stay there. It simply gets tiresome and even the action scenes stop being compelling."
" Not bad, but not good.
",-0.2924,0.9381,2017-05-26 00:00:00,6,"As far as Video Game Adaptations go, Assassin's Creed was pretty good. It's not that faithful to the source material, there's a ton of CGI, you don't get attached to the characters, and the story is a blatantly obvious set-up for a franchise. However, the action is fun, the story is at least interesting and for essentially squeezing in the first game's main story into an hour and a half and twisting it for the filmmaker's own version of it, the end result is enjoyable and entertaining."

So of course this film is based on that series. Folks who are unfamiliar with the video game will be scratching their heads. Essentially, a confusing plot with minimalist script and dialogue delivered without conviction. I found myself having no feeling for any of the characters whatsoever. Action scenes are....nothing memorable; flashes of slashing and stabbing, glimpses of chase sequences where everyone defies gravity. It always amazes me in movies where you have only 1 or 2 main characters able to fight off an entire battalion of bad guys; there are just that good. I was waiting for a scene like in the game where the hero jumps from the highest point and dives into hay; and finally, it happens 3/4 of the way through the movie and the scene ends in the middle of the descent. We are deprived of the benefit of Cal landing in the bale of hay. Seriously? Current video games make liberal use of religious and political themes and modify them to fit their plot. This movie is no exception; take the story with a grain of salt; purely fictional. Probably the best things about this movie are special effects and costumes."

It is a decently entertaining movie. However, I also felt a bit underwhelmed.A less than sympathetic bum happens to be some direct ancestor to an ancient warrior belonging to a ancient secret assassins society protecting the apple of Eden. Since he is a near identical match to his ancestor he is, apparently, an ideal candidate for the evil Knights Templars to unlock ancient ""genetic"" memories that will help them find the apple. Yes I know, it is a bit of a scientific stretch but hey, it is a fantasy/sci-fi movie and it originates from a video game story so give it some slack.Speaking of the video game. I have not played the game and I have no idea if the movie follows the story of the game or not which probably is a good think for this movie. What I did have a hard time with though is this nonsensical notion of the apple containing the genetic code for ""free will"". What a load of bullshit in so many ways!There are a lot of quite good action and fight scenes in the movie. However most of them are flashbacks to the time of Callum's ancestor and it is not really Callum himself. It is not until the very end of the movie that Callum finally realizes his potential and gets to do some fighting in his own time. This disappointed me a bit.Overall I felt a bit underwhelmed. The movie plodded along at an almost leisurely pace except for the outbursts of action in the flashbacks. There was not really much happening that made me interested except for the action sequences. The acting is also adequate but not more.When Callum finally gets around to do some assassin stuff in our time it is too little too late. There is a nice fight when he and his assassin colleagues break out of the Knights Templar's facility but the final show down between the two parties is, well, bland."

I generally think that this modern phenomenon of Nerds and young so called film lovers have a very different concept of what is artistic and and clever. After seeing this film for the third time I have concluded that most Western audiences have metamorphosed into a variation of, so called, developing countries expectations of what a film should be, i.e. India, china, e.t.c. I am of course referring to the mainstay audiences - The Mob - and I'm afraid that means the majority of brainwashed youth and the cult of Nerds. These viewers find it hard to comprehend artistic interpretations when it involves their cult idols. They seem to lack the foresight to appreciate anything outside the group think mentality. This film is sumptuously stunning in every way from story to set design, from acting to atmosphere and action, and from masterful photography and editing to an absolutely fabulous soundtrack. To all the Nerds out there you will eventually win in destroying all good art and replace it with your insipid, superficial CGI version."

The effects look great and have a overall ""epic"" feeling that belongs in the Assassins creed series. However, How great the movie looks is shortened by the lack of storytelling and misses out on some of the essentials of the Creed series. This movie follows the same path as the game series did, Ezio and Altalier gave the order a face and backbone of a story, where the ones who followed lacked a spine and just wear fancy costumes. Yes I know this is my opinion of the story, and I'm sad to say the movie didn't live up to it expectations.Lets bring it back to a action movie that should be able to stand alone, it does what it has to do, being a visual outstanding movie, with great action scenes and a simple story.

It was actually quite oddly placed in the movie, even the way they filmed the scene of her walking.

" True to the story
",0.4215,0.9774,2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,"I've been a die-hard assassin's creed fan since inception many years ago, and I have to say this film stay very true to its roots. I will try to be as objective as possible in this review, so as to avoid the 'fan obsessed loving review' comments. May have commented that not enough time is pent in the animus....whilst this is true in the sense that the games are 99.9% spent in the animus, the amount of screen time attributed to the present is simply what is sufficient to explain the plot, and how the modern day templar and assassins respond to the information that is generated from the animus (remember that it is simply a memory machine....gives you information that you need to act upon).Michael Fassbender = fantastic. Acts in both times frames brilliantly, demonstrating the turmoil someone may experience by being thrust into a world that is not your own, but one that you are born into.My main criticism is that there isn't enough time to get to know the 'heroes' of the past, Aguilar and his fellow assassins. I can't truthfully say that I can remember the names of the fellow 'past time characters.' Whilst this contrasts with my earlier acknowledgement that the 'present time screen time' is more than adequate and appropriate, it would have been nice to get to know the 15th century characters a bit better.Comments that the apple doesn't get enough screen time is ridiculous.....Percentage wise it gets far more than what is given in the games. And on top of that the action/free run sequences are brilliantly executed and not short lived at all. I think I clocked the middle sequence approximately at 10 minutes. So viewers, eat your heart out. May not be everyone's cup of tea, but fans of the franchise should love it (if they consider its a 2 hour movie not a 50 hour game), as should plenty of Assassin's naive people.Eat your heart out people. The Assassins' are here!!"
" Pretty Good For Low Expectations
",0.6124,0.9827,2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. Video game movies are still in their infancy as a genre, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that they haven't fully fleshed out a good formula yet. That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie. From the get go, it had a lot of different things it needed to accomplish. It had satisfy people who were fans of the games, but also interest the casual moviegoer as well as appeasing the critics. That's a tall order for any movie and I think Assassin's Creed managed it moderately well. It wasn't perfect of course, but you can only do so much in two hours. As a fan of the games, I definitely think the story presented in the movie was an oversimplification of the plot. It's the kind of thing that without the context of the games, really makes the story seem fairly flat and uninteresting. The movie was missing some pretty important exposition, making things like the point at which Cal decides to join the assassins feel very sudden and out of place. Those things coupled with some clumsy writing, I can see why many people were unimpressed with the film. However, in light of all the different and at times conflicting aims they had with the movie, I think it turned out decently well. Its story may have been cursory, but only out of necessity. You simply can't condense hundreds of hours of gameplay into a two hour film without simplifying things to a high degree. You can't draw a new audience without making the film accessible. Despite all the corners they had to cut, I think they managed to make a pretty decent film. I for one, am excited to see more."

I thought this movie would be a chance to get interested in this story, but I couldn't bear more than 30 min. Wasted cast in a matrix like plot, but where as it is announced since the beginning, the protagonist cannot change anything, only help remember someone's life. It might have had a different outcome later, but I wouldn't care watch a movie where someone watches a memory movie of someone else. A few action scenes thrown in there to impress us were just some wasted dollars. I watched Monster Trucks instead which although cheaper and childish was more entertaining"
" False premise, just entertained movie
",0.4019,0.5155,2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"As the video game, Assassin's Creed begins with a proved false premise, the DNA memory. From there all the story loses consistency and the entire purpose of every single action falls in a big lie. The scenes that bring us between past and present doesn't convince, even though Michael Bassbender makes a great job, as usual. Entertained and good practical effects, but with a script full of inconsistencies where the story is the main target for many of us, it turn in just another money maker movie."

This I think was a problem, the movie *does* seem to expect you know the backstory - it gives a ridiculously short introduction to the world, where very quickly you have to understand the Templar knights are fighting some assassins for some secret thing called ""an apple"".Production standards were top notch, acting is pretty good (with a good effort by Irons, Coutillard and Fassbender) and some amazing imagery, but the big fail here was the storyline and perhaps too fast pacing. Clichéd bad guy from Irons and the overall simplification of what is complex material makes this just a silly action movie for the gamers when it could have been so much more."

It's asinine. It does not make the move more immersive, it just distracts from the movie itself."

So I was really looking forward to watching it when I heard it had been adapted into a film. But it was so under utilised I felt! The characters were 2D, the constant smoky effects detracted from scenes, poor scripting, dull OST and what really peeved me was the few random direct cuts from gaming footage. When someone went to aim a bow or something, the screen would then be as in the game to allow the player to aim in first POV. It was really jarring and not appropriate for the film. Overall, a poor attempt to get people interested, especially if they're not gamers. Such a shame given both the rich storyline and great actors."

",0.5719,-0.61,2017-04-13 00:00:00,9,"Through a company that can unlock genetic memories, Cal Lynch/Aguilar (Fassbender) discovers all there is to know about his ancestor – Aguilar de Nerha - who was part of a secret society: The Brotherhood of Assassins; and now Cal, as Aguilar, is prepped to go back in time - attached to a machine called an Animus to locate the Apple of Eden. Cal has no choice in this as you will come to understand. The Knights Templar want the Apple of Eden to control the world under their rule. The Brotherhood of Assassins want to protect the Apple and keep it away from the Knights Templar. Cal is told by Dr Sofia (Marion Cotillard) that finding the Apple of Eden is a way that God has put in it codes that will suppress violent behavior in man. Cal doesn't exactly buy this but he's game. (Actually, he has no choice)This is a very creative way of going back in time, and fighting the Knights Templar. So we bounce back and forth from the present to 500-yrs ago when Aguilar lived. Cal does all his fighting from the Animus. Yeah, it's a little crazy, but that is what we have. We see Cal as a boy witnessing the killing of his mother. Everyone knows Sultan Muhammad (Khalid Abdalla) has the Apple of Eden and his boy is kidnapped by the Templars to insure they get the Apple.This can be somewhat confusing, but in time you will get the gist of all this. Other than that we see excellent choreography fighting stunts with CGI thrown in. They must have used Jackie Chan's choreographers because the fighting stunts are spectacular. Also a big shout-out for the Editing, which was spot on. And the music was excellent and it added to the suspense and tension. This movie is based upon a video game. (Ah, now it makes sense)You ask about a twist and, yes, there is one and it's possible you will have figured it out. Notables: Ariane Labed as Maria, an assassin partner alongside Aguilar; Jeremy Irons as Rikkin, the company head and the father of Sofia; Brendan Gleeson as Joseph, Cal's father 500-yrs ago; and Charlotte Rampling as Ellen who wants to shut down Rikkins experiments as they are costing too much and not much has been gained. You have to listen carefully because thrown in are dialogues about the Bible, philosophy and tales of the Knights Templar and the Assassin's Creed which is: We work in the dark to serve the light. We are Assassins. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb was heard, I think."

",-0.5719,0.9661,2017-04-11 00:00:00,3,"It wasn't that bad. For a popcorn movie. But all i see was a very obvious blockbuster oriented movie. Simple story, bad guys you can smell from afar just by watching how they drive their SUV in a one line way, and lazy excuse for actions scenes. I love the game, all of them. Specially Rogue who manage to make us doubt the Assassin's are not some kind of stupid fanatics unable to see when they are doing things the wrong way.Nothing of the sort in this movie. It's not a question of having enough time to tell a story. It's about telling the good stuff out of the original story. You can let aside the SF part of the game. But you cannot leave behind the historic accuracy that made the franchise so good for people that are not kids anymore. You can't go straight to the point were Templar obviously looks like bad guy (and say out loud they are lying and manipulating people to get what they want) at the 15min top in the movie, and hoping that two or three lines of cheesy dialogue will make us believe that they are maybe good guys.Cotillard said in an interview that she received a new script that was not what she signed for at the first place. That they have to change a lot and cut as much (see the trivia: 2hours 20 to be cut down to 1h45, like a Disney movie for kids... seriously...) Everything point that the studio have something to do with that end cut.Now, i would love to see a director's cut. Or extended, i don't care : it cannot be worse..."
" Good Action Movie
",0.4404,0.9289,2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,"""Assassin's Creed"" is a very enjoyable action movie, with action, fighting and chase scenes just as thrilling and dramatic as anything in the Bourne or John Wick movies. Yes the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense sometimes, and I am still not sure if the apple from the tree of knowledge is a good thing or a bad thing. I have never played the video games, and I am sure being familiar with them would throw a lot of light on what is going on in this movie. But it didn't really diminish my enjoyment of it. The director employs a lot of very hypnotic and unusual camera work, as Mr. Fassbender's character weaves back and forth through time. The ending seemed like they may be planning a sequel, where maybe we'll learn more about the Assassin's Creed, Knight Templars and the mysterious, powerful apple."
" A giant mess with picture slide-show action scenes
",-0.3612,0.6154,2017-04-11 00:00:00,3,"Despite never having played the video-game(s), I was curious about this movie. So far most video-game movie adaptions are unwatchable so maybe this one can change that trend. And having Fassbender on board is a good start, right? After a brief introductory in 15th century Spain, we meet Cal Lynch (Fassbender) who is on dead row and about to receive a lethal injection. He is not killed however but abducted into a research facility called 'Abstergo Industries' and he is needed for an important experience. Abstergo has created a device to relive memories of the ancestors of whoever is plugged into the device. Turns out that Cal is the last remaining descendant in a long bloodline that can be tracked down to a great assassin of 15th century Spain: Aguilar de Nerha. The Abstergo scientists have found out that Anguilar was tasked with protecting an ancient artifact and keep it from falling into the Templars, who want to use the artifact to control all human life on earth. Through re-living Aguilar's memories, they hope Cal can find out the location of the artifact in the present day. But will Cal help the scientists and why do they want the artifact so desperately? Assassin's Creed is an action movie with a simple plot (find object x for us), some cool action scenes in 15th century Spain and present time but with loads of boring scenes that are only there to explain stuff literary. The only character with some depth is Cal, all the other people could be easily replaced with cardboard cutouts because you never get to know what drives them and where they came from. The research facility is filled with other 'prisoners' but I still don't know what they were doing there and why? There are some who have one or two lines in the movie, but how am I suppose to care for these folks? And there are hundreds of guards, despite it not being a prison but none of them has a gun? Fassbender says: 'what the f*ck is going on?' in the movie, and that pretty much sums it up. And I don't want to come over as a bloodthirsty person but why the hell is this not rated R? If you make a movie about people killing each other with knives and swords it makes sense to show bloody scenes! They cut away from violent scenes so often in this movie it makes my head hurt. There are scenes with twenty people getting killed with knives in a room but there is not one drop of blood! A miracle! And I guess there is some great stunt-work pulled of but you never get to see it because each action scene is filmed from 15 angles that change every second. It almost look like a picture slide show at times, horrible! The ending is very disappointing, and has the worst sequel bate I have seen in some time. They could as well put 'to be continued..' under it.I don't see any reason to watch this movie, it's just a giant mess with slide show action scenes. To bad that great talents like Fassbender waste their time on projects like these, but I guess he bought a nice boat or car from it? Also sad that they once again failed to make a good video-game movie, I'll just keep waiting."

A little disappointed to this film maybe because I have too high expectation due to the success of the game. I think the main problem is the ways the director used to change between the history and now. Maybe just focus on the history will be better instead of mixing in any modern elements. you may say if they do so, the film will not follow the setting according to the Ubisoft, but who cares? I believe most players and audience will focus more on the time when we are in the past and do assassination instead of conspiracy of abstergo."
" Terrible movie based on a game with a terrible story..
",-0.7351,0.8874,2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"No idea what these people were smoking.I have played all Assassin Creed games up until AssCreed: Unity, which is godawful. I haven't played any afterwards because they all do same thing over and over again.Back to the movie.First things first. Apparently they are very proud of majority of movie not having CGI. Too bad you can't tell that because the editing is so bad that it makes majority of movie look like CGI. ""Stunt man did largest drop ever"", herp derp, in the movie, it looks like a cheap CGI effect. Most of the action scenes are terrible thanks to the overuse of VFX where Animus scenes are merged with actual action, not letting the audience enjoy anything.Second, the music is terrible. Assassins Creed (at least the first few) had music by Jesper Kyd, and it's some of THE best music ever made for anything. Did they use that music? Nope, they have some generic tunes mixed with modern music (why?) for no reason every now and then. Nothing that stands out or you'd want to listen to.Third, plot is awful. Then again, it's the hilariously bad plot of the games so can't really blame the movie for following the games into the dustbin.Fourth, there is nothing memorable, nothing that stands out, nothing the movie does better than the games.If you go back to the games, only few Assassin's Creed games have good stories (when I say ""good"", I mean fun enough to sit through). AssCreed 2/Brotherhood and Black Flag, primarily. The movie doesn't follow the protagonist from the game sooo.. why even bother? What is funny is that they wrote a new script to make the movie stand out from the games. REALLY? Cause except from the protagonist, pretty much rest of the movie is a copy of the game. The only thing that is new is some minor back story for the protagonist and surprise surprise, it's terrible as well (and awkwardly presented as well).Oh and dialogue is muffled and blended in with background noise (music, SFX) so good luck understanding what most characters are saying most of the time (when they are speaking English).Meh. I was going to give it 2/10 but while writing the review, decided to give it 1/10."

" The story doesn't matter
",-0.0191,-0.9438,2017-04-05 00:00:00,1,"OK kids, there's a few things I keep reading that are so annoying. 1 - ""If you didn't play the game you can't appreciate this movie"". Wrong. I played the game(s) and hated the movie. 2 - ""I enjoyed it so it's a good movie"". Wrong. There's a line, not even that thin, between enjoying something and consider it a good product. 3 - ""The story is exciting, so must be the movie"". Wrong again. The story doesn't matter. You need a director who knows what a frame actually is, and we haven't got one here, I'm sorry. Everything looked terrible from the very beginning. In the scene where he lies on the ""chair"" his head is not centered to the frame... I mean, seriously?? Coming to the first fight (which I'm pretty sure you'll all agree is a very important feature in this work) I was disgusted of the awfully poor quality of....well really everything. Every scene is confused and looks weak. Also the sound is a sloppy job. So, in few words.....the movie SUCKS!"
" Sad, but movie is poor
",-0.7351,-0.5323,2017-04-03 00:00:00,3,"I have to admit, I like these kinds of movies, but this one was pretty bad. The script was cliché from the beginning, with the typical good guy versus bad guy concept without delving into the story line sooner. They could have done a much better job of developing the history and less time with the fight scenes, which in of themselves were nonsensical. Since I really never played the video game, I needed more background. My assumption is that an assassin lurks in the shadows and does his best work one assassination at a time. In this movie, it is one or two guys against an army. A good movie, tells a story that has its twists and turns without boring the audience. This was boring. And the sad thing is that the Templar knights, the apple, and the creed of assassins is a great story to tell. Instead, they give us fight club. Hollywood continues to disappoint in this fantasy genre putting out cliché after cliché. Focus on the story and intertwine the historical perspective rather than give us endless fight scenes. Leave most of the fight scenes for the video game. Take a lesson from Indiana Jones or Star Wars, and think about how the story was developed. Neither one of those movies had the benefit of a video game precursor or even baseline other than good versus bad, but they made it interesting. Long story short, try again with the sequel because I like the concept, but work on the delivery."
" Confusing......
",0.0,0.2291,2017-04-02 00:00:00,5,"Assassin's Creed is, simply put, confusing.....The overriding concept, a weird hybrid blend of mysticism and science, with a reincarnation/hereditary society of assassins thing going on, is not well explained at its inception or elaborated upon clearly, as the film progresses. Predictably the net result, is confusion on the part of the viewer. I believe this film is based on a computer game franchise of the same name and one reviewer did indicate it was hard to follow if you did not know the back story, as found in the games. I can but agree. The acting is sound and action sequences in this film are well executed and have some polish. Its a shame therefore, more care was not taken with the tale itself. Five out of ten from me."

",0.0,0.9015,2017-04-02 00:00:00,5,"Positives: The movie is beautiful as far as costumes and set designs. The stunts are impressive and well-shot and getting an in-depth look at how the Animus works was, as a fan of the games, a great joy. Negatives: The main problem is the story as it isn't fleshed out or gripping. It simply goes from point A to point B with no real effort or even character development, which is kind of critical. Also 90% of the movie takes place in the present. You have no emotional connection to the Assassin because very little time is spent with him and the characters that you do spend time with aren't very likable. Another point is the color pallet of the movie is muted, the present being dimly lit and quite drab while the past is excessively smoky with either dust or ash constantly blowing in front of the camera. And the locations are not nearly as vibrant or lush as the trailers seemed to depict. To sum it up, there are some exciting elements to Assassin's Creed but nothing you haven't seen before. I'm glad I saw it just out of curiosity, but it is not one I would ever buy."
" Have never played the game, really enjoyed the movie
",0.373,0.9248,2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"I've never played Assassin's Creed, never seen anyone play it, and all I had picked up about it was that you go through different major wars/battles throughout history and kill people. I watched the movie online recently and I really enjoyed it. To be fair I did skip over any of the longer speaking parts where the Assassin dude wasn't actually in it (which I think was maybe only once or twice) because I wasn't really interested in them explaining it to me. I still generally understand the story line and I think the premise and execution of that idea was really entertaining. The action scenes were cool and the cinematography was wonderful (at least to my eye). I think it honestly might be more of a burden if you have played the games because it gives you a certain expectation. I literally just thought the trailer looked cool and I like Michael Fassbender as an actor (not really as a person though), so I went and watched it. Also, the captioning for the movie wasn't working so I was just going off of my high school Spanish knowledge to semi-understand what they were saying and I still enjoyed it. I think everyone might be trying to put more on this movie than they should. I suggest just seeing it as a cool look into secret society history and how many times someone can jump off a building and survive."

" A honest review by a gamer
",0.5106,0.8914,2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Hi, I would like to introduce myself as a real gamer, a player who has played all the Assassin's Creed games mostly on PC, and the last two on PS4. I call myself as a real gamer because I have platinum trophies in the last two games on PS4(Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate) you can check it out on my PSN profile: Linares2015. The people who badly criticize this movie and call themselves gamers, they barely have a single trophy in a game. Most of bad punctuations of those who call themselves ""gamers"", I bet they are casual gamers who have played Assassin for an hour and they consider themselves experts in Assassin's Creed. I find the movie excellent as an Assassin's Creed lover, its fidelity to the game is amazing and it was very difficult to do it. It is very hard to do a movie based on a video game with such a fidelity. Congratulations to the actors, director and everybody who worked on this movie, they made me enjoy the film. I've read some people who find the movie a bit confusing. I guess that it happens because people who made this movie were so afraid of the ""gamers"" critics, that they focused the movie for those who played the game, that makes some things can be confusing if you have never played all the Assassins games. If you had played the game, you would have been more familiar with the Templars-Assassin's war. it is explained briefly in the movie. And I think that it is the only mistake of the movie, The producer focused on the public who have played the games, but for those who haven't it can be a mess and a confusing story.

",0.0,0.9964,2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"All things considered, and among them being that this is a product for sale, for profit and franchising, thus having no room for content, it's not a bad movie. It delivers the premise and the action of the namesake. Fassbender is the man, and Cotillard's physiognomy can sell mannequins. Throw in some indie music and the CGI - and this becomes a good reason to buy some popcorn.This is what probably makes it the best game adaptation to date: it's not cringing(""imho""). Warcraft tried, but it ended up as a horrendous disgrace and a spit to the face of fans, cinema enthusiasts and generally adequate people. AC, on the other hand, manages to not really plague the original storyline(yet), and to deliver the interesting perspective of the Animus, one that we... I think, have been devoid of in the games.However, beyond that... AC falls into the trap of almost all modern Hollywood blockbusters: it's shallow. It tries to convey a message, a message that probably a large amount of viewers already know, but what tools does it use? Mommy issues(Hello, Magneto, you've already done that in First Class), daddy issues(Cotillard seems to enjoy these roles), peer pressure(when has a single rushed-up experiment ended well?) and ... emotions, many of them. We are supposed to care about the assassins, about their creed, about their task - because everybody seems to die left and right. Otherwise it won't work.But that's not all. Remember the irritation about how Godzilla was filmed? Well, bad news here, the leap of faith from the trailer... Will remain ""the leap of faith from the trailer""! And there's more like this - scenes that are kind of getting somewhere, only to be abruptly cut and never explained further. Imagine doing an Animus mission that's getting hot, then being plugged out, and the next time you return - you are a chapter ahead, and you have no idea what happened and why. Don't think it would work in the games.(I know that's ""exactly how they work"", but they let you ""finish"" it first)Finally - we get to the Martha part. Yes, the grand meme of BvS, the ultimate example of script ridicule. The movie makes us believe that the main characters betray their allegiances, and how? One moment Fassbender is bent on being trolled into being a good boy, the other he is seeing some weird Harry Potter reunion. One moment Cotillard is a good scientist, smart and brilliant. The other she has doubts about everything, as if she hasn't had a clue before.But if all of this looked somewhat like ""content"" then the finale is a large... ""wha?"" I could remember many modern movies that were kind of ""dropped"" in their script, and this is one of them. If everything signaled to a big showdown - nothing happened. Except for a weird ""Martha-grade"" character change. And we are left at that - a cliffhanger.Sure, a cold-minded approach is a good thing in cinema, and many would flame my comparison of scenes, as well as the idea of vanilla nostalgia. But there are good movies still. They can be, if the director wants it. A movie that first of all tries to get inside your head, not inside your eyes. This is not that kind of movie. Regardless of whether comparative examples existed, of whether golden age of cinema existed. It could have been better. It could have had more coherent story, more detailed characters and better pacing.Still, it's not a bad movie, it's not a terrible movie or a disappointment. And I would recommend anyone to watch it, fan or not. Because as a random Sci-Fi flick, as a feature-length trailer to the games, as a semi-thrilling ""bloody, yet PG-13 bloodless"" action package - Assassin's Creed definitely delivers some eye-candy."
" Enjoyable but fails to capture the magic of the game
",-0.4118,0.8294,2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"Overall an enjoyable movie to watch at least one time, but it simply fails to capture the elements that make the game series what it is.The story of each Assassin's Creed game takes place 95% inside the animus and thus in the historical setting of the Assassin's Creed universe.The remaining 5% takes place in the modern setting and kind of glues it all together and gives further meaning to all the actions you are doing in the historical setting.Where this movie fails is that it focuses almost entirely on the modern day setting and only uses the historic setting as a reason for action scenes. We learn very little about both main characters of the movie played by Michael Fassbender. In historic setting that is Aguilar and in modern day setting that is Cal Lynch.In terms of Aguilar we actually learn little to nothing about the character and in terms of Cal Lynch we only see tidbits of his life. Due to this complete and utter lack of character building in both modern and historic settings of the movie storyline, we simply have little reason to become attached and immersed into the story and movie as a whole.For those who have played the games, just saying the name Ezio Auditore da Firenze is enough to invoke feelings of attachment and fandom. Due to the vast depth of knowledge we have about Ezio, his youth, his adulthood and even his old-age.This movie should have avoided the modern day setting as much as possible and instead focused more on telling the story of Aguilar. Perhaps only at the end showing us even Cal Lynch. This would have delivered a much better movie experience and would also leave it open for a great sequel.The music is another issue of the movie, the trailer had horrendous music and the movie was not much better. Why they did not even consider to hire Jesper Kyd is beyond me."

I am a fan of the story line of the Videogames and in my own opinion it doesn't have to do with the Video Game. And when you are new into the Story and watch this movie, with no Game Background, you'll get lost. I can't describe how bad this movie is. At the beginning you get shot into the story, whit out the background about the Carracter Callum Lynch and Aguilar very sad about this. Another Ponit is the bad Camera view: a view First-Person - shoots but i prefer more at this one AAANNDDD.... the ""HAWK-EYE-MODE"" (The Point ,when Lynch is jumping from a building or get into Aguilar's World is bad!!!

" 'Mankind seems intent on destroying itself.'
",-0.5574,-0.5938,2017-03-30 00:00:00,6,"For those for whom the world of video gaming is a mystery this film, based on a game of that ilk, may be confused by this film. Or perhaps the confusion is just a matter of odd script writing. If you know about or even participate in gaming then this film will likely satisfy. For the rest of us, it is a rather overly long repetitious action flick, going from war to clash to bizarre ritual in an obtuse way. The 'concept' of the plot is sound: the Apple of Eden that promises an end to violence and destruction has been missing for centuries held by the Knights Templar and sought after by the Assassins. If that Apple can be restored to the good guys/girls then all will be well.Through Abstergo a company that creates a revolutionary technology that unlocks his genetic memories, Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) experiences the memories of his ancestor, Aguilar de Nerha, in 15th Century Spain. Callum discovers he is descended from a mysterious secret society, the Assassins and Templars, and amasses incredible knowledge and skills to take on the oppressive and powerful Templar organization in the present day. The science/machine that will assist Cal in his quest is the work of Dr. Rikkin (Jeremy Irons) and his beautiful daughter Sofia (Marion Cotillard). Other men in training for the mission include Moussa (Michael Kenneth Williams, who has failed the destiny thus far. Others included in the game (for that is what the plot is) include Cal's mother (Essie Davis), father (Brendan Gleason), Ellen Kay (Charlotte Rampling) and the bad guys Denis Ménochet, Khalid Abdalla, Callum Turner, Matias Varela, Javier Gutiérrez among others.Michael Fassbender is on screen most of the time – and in the last half of the film he satisfies those awaiting his apparent workout energies for the movie with displaying his constant shirtless torso. Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons are strong given their character roles. The cinematography by Adam Arkapaw is splendid, if confusing in its attempt to phases in and out of a 2016 lab and 1492 Spain. The monotone musical score Jed Kurzel fails to add. If you are addicted to video gaming (and that audience is vast) then the film will satisfy. For others, despite moments of interesting philosophy and history, the film is a very long song."

So it was with some negative preconceived ideas I went to watch this purge; actually I was drag by force by some friends, my fingers nails scratching the side walk. Lucky me I still had some of those mini bottle of whiskey in my bag stolen from the minibar in my hotel room, which I poured in an oversize and overpriced cup of coke and ice. it definitely help watch this almost 2 hours advertising for Ubisoft's franchise. OK, OK the story was original, but the way it was told, arf! thanks again johnny Walker! The CGI are so bad they had to hide the textures with smog particle effects in order to smooth the defects. The stunts are so fake, why did they even bother to hire real life actors if it is to make the new Kung Fu Panda. The movie would probably have been way better if instead they would have go full CGI following the example of Final Fantasy: Advent children. Do not call this a ""life action"" movie , there is nothing alive in this film."

Michael Fassbender has quickly become a favorite of mine and his ability is wonderfully on display in this movie.

I went in expecting it to be fair to middling, but that was an over estimation. This movie is slightly disordered and off hand. Things just happen, questionable things but we just have to accept them as they are. They constantly jump to the next scene without letting the previous ideas and actions sink in. It's either that or there some scenes which try hard to depict the intensity of the situation but failThe general idea of the movie is understood. The typical -""some oh so precious artifact must not fall into the wrong hands as it would spell the end of the world "". Though the consequences are constantly mentioned the audience is not really concerned. Some characters just exist for the sake of it providing no required purpose. The most disappointing aspect of the movie were the action scenes!! If not for anything else I thought this movie would be highlighted by its phenomenal battles. I expected more bloodshed and gore. At times the movements of the actors were slow and not fierce like they should've been. There was nothing to complain about the acting and with the stunning leads they had, it was obvious. In the end it was a very bland movie with high potential. It was entertaining of sorts but once its over, you are left blank. It does not confide anything to ponder over. I guess this movie would've been a big hit for those who have actually played the games. As they would understand the depth of the situation. However for any other movie goer it's just another flick to cross off from your list."

Not like in the video game where Ezio was ALIVE, we care for him and love him... but the life of Aguilar is so useless that we don't really care.

For a person who just knows a little about the game, I need to research to understand deeper, however, the movie excited me to do so. - Good action scenes that were simplified and well-executed. I love the fighting style. - Superb acting of the casts (Fassbender and Cotillard did the movie justice). - No ""cheesy"" moments (for me).

Characters were poorly developed and offered nothing in the way of any kind of arc. The script was a muddled mess of 'wouldn't it be cool if this happened' and 'dude let's try this' which made for an almost comedic hash of indecipherable dialogue that only Bill and Ted could appreciate. There were initially some interesting fight scenes but this obviously blew the budget as the second half of the movie left us alone with the poorly written trippy dialogue and cheap sets which were impossible to buy into. If you really must get involved in the Assassins Creed universe my advice I'd play one of the games as this drivel will only have you begging for the two hours of your life lost back.
" Could be good, but its not.
",0.2382,0.9074,2017-03-26 00:00:00,4,"This movie will be good for those who like action movies and its bad for those who know the game. I will judge the movie based on those two points of views. If i was a viewer with no clue about the series, i would think that it is a mediocre movie, with good imagination and cgi effects. Okay, maybe it was poorly written too. They were some parts of the story that were not explained, and the viewer is left wondering ''okay, how did this happen, and why?''. As for the gamer point of view, well, it was not what we expected, not at all. I mean, what's wrong with the usual animus from the game, why did they have to put a hand there? I put 4 stars out of 10. The reason for that is that they could had made an excellent movie, the story and the characters from the games where enough to produce something unique. Im not suggesting that the producers had to base the entire film to the game stories, no. All I'm saying is that they could have created something different, by sticking to the main idea of the AC series. This movie felt nothing like Assassin's Creed. It felt more like those new action movies that come out once in a while, those that you watch to kill some time and eventually you forget about it. Do you know which movie felt like it was supposed to feel? Deadpool. And do you know why? Because a fan of the character made the film, Ryan Reynolds.

The movie is vague on these subjects but understood more through Aguilar's revived ancestor memories with the stimulation by the Animus machine.

It does look awesome, the last generation of CGI doing a very good job in creating this atmosphere, but the plot which it is supposed to represent is actually the let-down of this movie. It's simplistic, linear and even predictable at times, providing almost zero satisfaction with its finale. The characters could also have received a bit more polish, many of them being dull and very predictable.

That is the simplest way I can attempt to explain my mixed feelings about this movie after I finished watching the entire closing credits. Yes, I sat through the closing credits despite my nagging urge to answer the call of nature because I refrained from getting up in the middle of the movie, worried that I might miss ""the scene"" that I have been hoping will come up to convince me that this was going to be a great movie.Based on an exciting game and with a stellar award-winning cast all of whom I admire, this was one movie I made sure to watch alone so as not to have anyone distract me from the anticipated pleasure of watching it. The performances did not disappoint (the casting was spot-on, the chemistry between the characters was superb), the dialogue made cliché lines sound fresh, the locations in Malta and Spain were breath-taking, the CGI and special effects were flawless, the fight scenes were choreographed very well, the production design and cinematography made me feel I was cold in the laboratory or warm while running on the rooftops even the song accompanying the closing credits was just right! Despite all these positive things, I didn't actually end up inching towards the edge of my seat. Nor did I feel any urge to clench my fist and subconsciously wish harm to any of the antagonists. Or to root for the protagonist. For someone who cries watching animated films, I was wondering what was missing. A dash of salt or freshly ground pepper, maybe? If you're interested enough in the movie to be reading my thoughts about it, I would suggest that you go ahead and watch it. I dare say that it is actually a good movie. Maybe even a great movie. But this is, at least for me, a case wherein the sum is not more than--or even equal to--the value of its parts.FUN FACT: This is the second movie I know where Brendan Gleeson and Michael Fassbender played father and son.

This movie is an absolute waste of time. I am saying that from the stance of a person watching a movie, tossing out any ""true to the video game"" requirements. This, as a movie, is terrible. It's jumbled, has too many moments of poor cinematography, shaky drone shots, tries too hard to incorporate video game cut scene style scenes into the live action movie medium (which failed to translate well here), forces its ""relatable to kids"" agenda and overall uses such terrible pacing that the movie ends up dull and boring.

Awesome.Okay, this probably wont appeal to every demographic, but under 40 you will enjoy this.The story is great from 20 minutes in, right to the end. I thought the first few scenes could of used some polishing, but gees, I was extremely satisfied when the credits rolled. This movie and story needs to be studied. Showcasing something that isn't seen everyday. Something that lurks in the shadows and minds of the dark, blending free-will with fantasy and reality.

The story is worse, the music rather rubbish, I mean it's seriously bad. The events in the past is far better than the events in the present. Still, I really can't stress enough how absolutely terrible the music was for this film, how people in charge even approve of this utter crap is beyond me."

The cast is very poor, the cast is very poorly used, Michael Fassbender can not save the Movie, the rest of the cast is not the fault of a weak script, the direction also has problems, and the worst problem was to make the movie have more moments in the present than in the past, and this ended the movie, plus it has some points Positive, the costumes are very good, they were right at least not to put any of the games as the protagonist of the film, and the Spanish Inquisition was a good choice, the action scenes are very loyal to the game, and we also have Parkour Hits in a few moments of action, and even though the scenes in the past are very interesting, the film has a bad script, a weak direction, an underused cast, and it makes the film tiring and boring.

Thanks to special technology Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) experiences memories of his ancestor in 15th Century Spain. He has to find the hidden object. So it's typical quest movie. Despite great actors ( Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons) it was quite boring. I know Malta where movie was shot, so funny thing for me was discovering locations."

Was watching it with a girlfriend, she was even more confused then me, though the important thing is, she played the game before. I haven't. I do not know what's happening in the game, so i was just trying to enjoy the movie. Resume.

" Horrible movie
",-0.5423,0.9029,2017-03-19 00:00:00,1,"As an avid fan of the AC games and a it's storyline this is just awful. Instead of using some of the awesome stories from the games they place this in Spain during the inquisition and makes an absolute train wreck of it. This could've been an excellent opportunity to redeem AC1 for the in hindsight lackluster and repetitive gameplay but still a good story. They could've used the story of Altair placing it totally in the old setting not even involving the Animus or Abstergo until the very end of the film having Desmond come out of it and thereby setting it up for a sequel more in line with this where it's set both in and out of the modern era. I would not recommend this to anyone but rather tell them to play the games for a massively longer and infinitely better time spent in the company of Altair, Ezio, Connor, Edward Kenway, Shay Patrick Cormac, Arno Dorian and Jacob and Evie."
" High Expectations but totally Disappointed!
",-0.7079,-0.0555,2017-03-19 00:00:00,4,"Iam a very big fan of the Assassin's Creed game series and I was looking forward to watch this movie since the day it was announced. However after watching the movie I was quite disappointed. The movie in my opinion failed to show the true essence of the Assassin's Creed, you don't actually feel anything about the movie, the plot was not only horrible but also very complex and you don't get to understand everything it tries to tell you. In case of the characters in the movie, you don't get to connect with any one of them and you feel empty and that something is missing.The action sequences were decent, while VFX and CGI were not up to the markMusic was also not good as expected. The movie if compared with the game franchise, failed to deliver the kind of music that Assassin's Creed deserved. Whereas the game franchise had one of the best music the movie doesn't have decent music apart from those loud soundtracks which did not even fit the tone of the movie.The only good thing about the whole movie was the performance of the cast and beautiful cinematography.Conclusion -The movie failed to cater the needs of the fans of the AC series. While in the game you remember the adventures of Altair, Ezio and even Desmond like a legendary tale, this movie gives you nothing but a simple plot with a complex treatment that makes it forgettable after you have finished watching it."

While i really enjoyed while it lasted, at the end i was lost by a very convoluted plot and script. I won't lie - i didn't get the ending, if there even was what to get in a first place... Now the whole second part of this film was the one which you could count as a bad film making, again, i did enjoyed while it lasted. One day after seeing it, i will forget it like it never happened.I liked the overall idea, but the film left me wanting for more. More of this film, and hopefully a sequel which i don't think will ever be green lighted after the fiasco this movie has had. Action sequences were involving, and especially that great and long chase sequence in the middle of the movie, that was pretty awesome. Acting was pretty OK for the material actors have had. There are many familiar faces here, but i kinda sure even they didn't get it what was going on in this movie. Seriously, they really needed to make much more tight script and more clear plot.Overall, ""Assassin's Creed"" for me is what stands for a guilty pleasure. While i wasn't a big fan of video game series, i did beat 2nd part and loved it, but i couldn't even finish 3rd part. But unfortunately the movie doesn't have plot at least as good as in a disappointing 3rd part of VG franchise. And yet, while it lasted, i did like it. This is not a bad film by any means, but more clear plot and script were absolutely necessary for this film."

The most meaningless, incoherent and badly written movie of the year.Instead of making a masterpiece with all the available material they could use, they started from scratch and created a version of what they -thought- Assassin's Creed was! The waste of all these talented actors who got payed and never got to actually act is outrageous. And will someone tell to the Production that the ""Apple"" is only ""The MacGuffin"" ?! (google it)Sadly to anyone who has not played the game, this movie will be a bit hard to follow.

You know the story.Fundamentally this movie is much like that old story. Its foundational story is water. Nothing more and nothing less. There are plenty of goods and stuff to put into the pot and boil a soup that would be nourishing and tasty.The problem is that the people who made the story, clearly didn't believe in the story of the soup-stone.

Apart from this there were other instances were I regretted watching a movie based and reviews as when I watched it myself I enjoyed them thoroughly(Warcraft).Such is the case with Assassins Creed. Throughout the movie I was waiting for the instance where it would slow down or start to get me bored as was stated by a YouTube reviewer who I watched for this movie and surprisingly enough I was in on the journey till the end. I feel after watching this movie that some of the critics are indeed paid off or are in power to destroy a movie unless the studios give in on their demands or just biased.This movie was enjoyable for what it was. The cast/acting, Screenplay, Sound etc. and I really liked and appreciate the filmmakers for keeping the language Spanish in the memories/flashback scenes. It was a good choice.

All the negative reviews for AC are from people that played the video game and are unhappy with the fact that this movie is not 100% like it. Whenever a movie is an adaptation of a book, game, or even remake, you will always have fans of the original that are unable to view the film as a separate work and are dissatisfied that it is not exactly identical. I almost did not watch this movie due to all the negative reviews. Upon closer inspection, the majority of the negative user reviews simply complain about the differences between the AC game and movie. Apparently if you have played the game, then don't bother watching the movie; but for those of us that haven't, this film is amazing. AC is non-stop action, a little bit of sci fi, and the visuals are spectacular. Evils organizations, secret societies, fantastic fight scenes, what's not to like?"

",0.2382,0.9736,2017-03-17 00:00:00,5,"# No Spoilers! Directed by Justin KurzelStarring: Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and Jeremy IronsOverview: This movie was based on a series of really good video games so the ideas and lore were there but it could have been so much more and explored so much more of the universe. There's some good acting a decent action so I still recommend you see it.# Possible Spoilers!Good:1. Michael Fassbender was decent in his role as Callum Lynch but fell flat as Aguilar2. Marion Cotillard was actually very good as Sophia and stole every scene she was in. 3. The stunt work in the movie was excellent and you can tell they put a lot of effort into it. 4. Some good action scenes5. It had some cool ideas which it introduced to the lore and could definitely be explored more in a sequel.Bad: 1. Jeremy Irons wasn't that great as Rikkin.2. Michael Fassbender was very weak as Aguilar and just fell flat in every scene he was in.3. The vast majority of this movie is set in the Modern World. If you ask any avid Assassin's Creed player what the most boring parts of the games are, they would probably say parts in Modern World. It was necessary to progress the story but I think it could have been toned down a lot. They even used the modern world in supposed Animus scenes which actually ruined some scenes entirely.4. The action was horrifically shot which is very sad because of how much effort you can tell they put into the stunt work. Some people may like the style of action but many will not and the movie definitely suffers because of it.5. The story was a very clustered mess. You could argue that you don't watch these types of films for the intricate stories but then I'll tell you to play the Ezio trilogy. Mostly excellent games with mostly excellent stories. They should have followed the Ezio trilogy to some extent, or even just Brotherhood. Sure it wouldn't be entirely original, or reinvent the wheel, but it would be a hell of a lot more interesting and coherent than this clustered mess.6. The main good parts of the movie were parts set inside the Animus but they manage to ruin than by constantly flipping back and fourth between the past and present. It was cool and interesting the first couple of times. But when every single action scene or cool moment is interrupted with this, it just drags the movie down. That's sad because it was really the only idea I liked in the film but then they hammer it over your head.7. Horrible Effects.5/10 Would recommend if you're drinking or with friends"

",0.0,-0.2408,2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"The reason that Rotten Tomatoes and Metascore are rating this a bad score is because they most likely have never played the actual games. This is the misconception with most video game adaptations. You have to know the basic story line and lore of Assassin's Creed in order to understand the movie. Same with Ratchet and Clank, you have to understand the first 1 or two games in order to understand what is going on. Except that was a remastered version of the first game. Either way, basic video game knowledge is definitely needed in order to understand Assassin's Creed. This movie was also surprisingly well made, and a decent cast. I do recommend watching this movie when you find the DVD available in your local stores."

No characters from the scenes set in the past were really fleshed out at all, they didn't really have any character to speak of and that was certainly one of the strengths of the video games. Jumping back and forth from the past to the present during fight scenes was quite distracting and took away more than it added. Really not sure why they would let all the assassins eat lunch together, don't know would good they thought might come from that. Overall it wasn't the worst film ever, it looked good visually and the acting was fine but it felt like more of a wasted opportunity than anything to shout about."

Enough to say that I tried to play one of those games and the fun and killing was always interrupted by annoying cinematics. Somehow, their idea of making a movie after the game is to expand the cinematics and remove any fun. They kept the running around on roofs, although, again, it makes no sense.Bottom line: it's a nice to look at crapshow. Characterization is almost non existent, people who have not played the games won't understand anything and the only thing that was good was Fassbender."

With it's stunning in game visuals, beautiful locations & action sequences I figured that a movie would have unlimited potential and could truly be a sight to behold!I stand by that statement, but place emphasis on the word ""Potential"" and this film doesn't come close to meeting it.First of all I was skeptical when I heard that Fassbender would be taking the mantle, it's not that he isn't a talented actor it's simply that I couldn't see him as an Assassin. I believe he was cast because he's currently ""Trending"" therefore the role is irrelevant, he's the right person at the right time. As I expected he doesn't do the role justice, he's not bad he's simply poorly cast.Next the writing and general creation of the movie is as such you can imagine the writers having the Assassins Creed game series explained to them for 10 minutes and basing the movie entirely on that. This is not a love letter for the fans, it's a loosely based on mess that will not appease many players. Rushed, poorly cast, dreadfully sound tracked, badly made and just more fuel for the video games adaptations don't work fire. I haven't been this disappointed in a film for years."

There was no essence. Present was happening very slow while the past was on fast forward. The director didn't give us enough information to understand how and what is happening. Maybe they are looking to make this a franchise and we will get more answers but overall i was disappointed. I was expecting more."
" Assassins Creed (2016)
",0.0,0.8856,2017-03-14 00:00:00,6,"A film that really should have stayed in the drawing room. I really like the video games. I played all of the games for PS3 and was really invested in the setting, story, and expansive gameplay. However, video game based movies have a bad track record (unless you are thinking about great camp like Mortal Kombat). Unfortunately, this film isn't much different. If you compare it to other video game based films, sure it stacks up as one of the better ones if not the best. However, the film has about a tenth of the video game series' excitement.Cal is on death row and subjected to lethal injection, but then he wakes up and finds out he is in a facility run by Abstergo that uses high tech technology to sync him with the past of his ancestors from generations ago. His ancestor was an Assassin in 15th century Spain. Corruption runs rampant in the present and the best and we basically follow the adventure in time. There is plenty of action in the film though the cinematography and camera-work doesn't always work. The film is busy in plot, its far too overplotted. I understand that the games are complex in nature but the little changes done to make the present day more clear have only made it worse and more privy to questions.I think the film should have gone with the Ezio Auditore portion of the Assassins Creed time frame, rather than creating a character and throwing him into Spain. The film would have benefited from exploring Renaissance era Italy and I could only imagine the missed opportunity of having the characters scaling 14th century Rome and Florence. That aside, this film felt too dark picture wise. There is little visual vibrancy. Characters and new plot points are kind of thrown together at the random. Most importantly, most of it is not very interesting.I thought Justin Kurzel did a wonderful job adapting Macbeth. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are often reliable and shined as the leads. In this they fade away to a bad script. Kurzel really took a misfire trying to adapt this franchise to film and what we get was something unremarkable.I still think he can redeem himself with something along the lines of his previous work; just leave this video game film adaptation business aside and pursue something better.6/10"
" Actually pretty decent, Critics were being too harsh on this movie
",-0.2263,0.9878,2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"I understand that some characters might have underwritten but people that bashing this movie as confusing are beyond me, maybe they just like or expect some full blown explosions and mediocre/boring setting. this is as simple as it can get. though the movie should've utilize more of its time with cutting some of exposition scenes and replace it with character developments, I get that it's beautiful but some time it's a little bit obnoxious. Also at least the action are far more clearer than half of action movies with their shaky cams. the parkour and fighting scenes though not a lot but executed pretty well. 7,5/10I'll be honest I enjoyed this movie more than CA: Civil War. Though now I much prefer if this series made as a TV series not a movie. Maybe that's why some people still confused by the whole story and lore. So to summary:Pros: + overall good MC and M. Fasbender did a great performances. + decent acting for some characters. + Beautiful Cinematography. + a faithful depictions of Assassins and Templars from the series. + well done action scenes. good parkour and fighting scenes. shaky cams and obnoxious jump cuts are pretty minimal, maybe only 1-2 scenes. + decent music but definitely could do moreCons: Average story and plots, pretty similar to the first game storyline but with some changes and twists. -Some dialogues were not that good. Not immersive and bit awkward. -Some characters were underdeveloped, especially in the past time. -a bit underwhelming ending, obvious sequel baiting. -too many stay still/exposition scenes, maybe they should cut those and give some characters a perspectives and developments."

I can say that Justin Kurzel has done excellent work, it is true that I had great apprehension before seeing the film, and when I saw it, I found the film was excellent, and that nothing had been distorted from the game, I felt the emotions of Game, it is quite obvious that the emotions between playing and visualizing the film are different and the emotions do not harm each other, and one feels the soul of the game in the film. Justin Kurzel was able to capture and keep the essence of the video game and to broadcast it in the film. Fans of the game should not be disappointed, at least I hope, because I have not been disappointed. As for the music: the soundtrack is ""Jed Kurzel (Justin's brother""), I can not say that it has composed effective sounds and the spirit of the credo made it well. Action side, no time out, the rhythm of the film is born, we do not get bored for a moment in the film. The scenario is very good and does not detract from the original idea of ​​the video game. As for the special effects, they are simply incredible, it's crazy what can be done now and in addition the stuntmen have done a wonderful job in the film, thank you to them. One of the highlights of the film is the incredible interpretation of: Michael Fassbender it superb and it pays tribute to his character giving him a beautiful vitality. In conclusion, it is a very good cinematographic adaptation of the game, the bad reviews of the press are in no case justified, it is true that we like a movie or not, but their negative criticism was exaggerated. ""Assassin's Creed"" is by far a disappointing film, it is a very good film, amazing even and it is a very good entertainment, so I recommend this film. A nice tribute also to Ubisoft."

One of the things I liked about this movie was the fact that Ubisoft gave the creators of the movie a lot of room to make the movie into their own story that has no connection to any of the current games out.

Kurzel , the director, was able to put together a movie that works well, keeping the story dark and intense, dramatic in some moment, and with a great action parts, it doesn't seems at all a video game adaptation seems a really nice product. Arkapaw was able to create a cinematography that is really better of a lot of other movies, I was impressed by assassins creed cinematography with some light games and sensibility to the natural light that is awesome. Environment design and visual effects are really nice. I was already impressed for the work by Kurzel and Arkapaw on Macbeth, visually isn't the same level, also because the story and the movie are completely different, but it's very close to.

",0.0,0.8879,2017-03-12 00:00:00,5,"Well , I feel the meta-score is more accurate. I played the first game a decade ago. So I don't recall much. Judging this as a movie alone, not comparing to the game. The direction leaves you not enough to care for any of the characters or the story. Not enough character development, rushes through the story. Jeremy Irons potential is wasted, he has very few lines in the movie. I feel Michael Fasbender is miscast for the role as well. Had some cool special effects, but otherwise a very forgettable movie. Could have used more character development and perhaps smarter dialogue.Needed stronger writing and cleaner direction."

",-0.5267,0.7303,2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"Dreadful movie with soulless, really dense characters, pacing slower than a snail on benzodiazepines, story overexposed for franchise fans and apparently underexposed for the rest. Plot even worse than original, which was already just an excuse or maybe a lampshade for the mechanics of the game. Of course the parts taking place in the past are the best moments of the movie, but still not good enough to make the experience at all satisfying. I've seen Uwe Boll's movies that were better in every aspect except budget."

There are a lot of movies based on video games, some good examples: Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Tombraider, Prince of Persie, some movies that are doubtful: Mortal Combat, Doom, BLoodrayne, Hit-man, Postal, Rampage, Warcraft, The Angry Birds movie and some that are just plain bad: Far Cry, Max Payne, Silent Hill Revelations, Postal. Assassin's Greed belongs into the good category. From the first minute you're drawn into the world of the assassins, I found the suspense in this movie very good. At first the story might be confusing, but all is explained. Then the rest, the effects are good, very good, the acting is fine en the directing is of a high level. All in all a good movie."

The plot is also quit weak. Something about a symbolic apple that the church is after, for some sort of power it holds. I never quite understood if the power was real or symbolic. Nor if it was the modern day church or free masons or what.Making it take place in the modern day of age,and telling the story in flashbacks, was a big mistake.They should've stuck to the past. Second; making the bad guys appear literally out of the woodwork, only works in video games. In movies you need a reason for them being there. You have soldiers showing up at rooftops and ledges far far ahead of the fleeing assassins, even though he picks a random route,and nobody thought he would escape. The constant flashback are annoying. Not to mention,too much of the movie takes place in the present,which makes it hard to follow.Since everything that suppose to drive the story forward, takes place in the past.Found it hard to understand where those two mergedA problem with games vs movies based on games,are the interaction. In a game you interact,you experience,through your actions with the character. In a movie you are simply there as a by stander who observe it all.Which means the a actors have to make you identify, with their action.And root for them. No such thing here,Having a secret brotherhood of assassins, sort of mean you have to be a secret. I'm pretty sure that means, no significant tattoos on your face. That would make it kind of hard to blend in.. There's also to much posing for camera,holding pose after each slay.No pro assassin would ever do that,whilst surrounded by enemy's"

" Not Perfect but still Good.
",0.4312,0.9561,2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"~ Assassin's Creed 2016 Review ~Even tho i don't care about critic-scores, I still thought the film must be complete crap to get such a HUGE backlash from critics. But after watching it myself, I really don't understand why all the hate. Sure the film is not ""perfect"" but even with its flaws it's a good movie.Pros: - DIRECTING by Justin Kurzel is really good. Completed with many beautiful shots, intense Parkour chase scenes, and great-shown emotional moments. - The MUSIC-SCORE is freaking awesome. Nothing like the shitty-rap-songs they used in the trailers. - The PLOT is by far the most interesting thing in the movie (which is a good thing). Hands down to the writers Adam Cooper, Bill Collage & Michael Lesslie. -ACTING performances by Michael Fassbender, Jeremy Irons, Michael Kenneth Williams, Charlotte Rampling, Ariane Labed, Marion Cotillard were all fantastic. - PRESENT is the main time-period focused in the film. While the past is just a ""tool"" used to make the story richer. Many were disappointed by that choice but I think it was a smart decision by the writers. - The PROTAGONIST (Cal) & the ANTAGONIST (Rikkin) are really well written characters with understandable motivations.Cons: - Sometimes the motivations for Marion Cotillard & Denis Ménochet's characters felt off and I think its because of disagreements by Ubisoft and 20th century fox. - The START is kind of slow (in a bad way) and feels sloppy like its a fan-made version on Youtube. Thankfully that's only for the first 13 minutes of the film. After Cal (protagonist) ends up in Abstergo the film picks up really fast. - A character named SOFIA, despite the great performance by Marion Cotillard her motivations at the very end of the film confused me very much. Once again I think its because of disagreements by Ubisoft & Fox.Bonus: - I was really surprised by how good the fight sequences were choreographed but the director (kind of) messed it up here. Some times there were shaky-shots and quick-cuts. Most films use shaky-cam and quick-cuts because they want to hide bad choreography and stunt doubles but why use them when the choreography is good. It doesn't make sense. - The film is also not for the wider audience. To fully appreciate it, you don't need specifically to have played the games but at least done a research on the assassin's creed universe.Overall I blame 20th Century Fox for ""most"" of the cons. But even with the flaws it has its entertaining movie. SCORE : 7.5 / 10"
" Good game movie, quite a solid entry to a series
",0.5849,0.9956,2017-03-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie is solidly and well executed. The creators played it safe to the sentiments of the games' series fans as the story features pretty much the same elements as the first of the assassin's creed games. The main characters are relatively well developed but feel like an intro to a much bigger arc of the series of movies. Saying that, the story of the movie was completed and didn't feel like an unnecessary cliffhanger although it did feel a bit rushed at the end. I have to give a significant credit to the creative teams that made the costumes, the locales and made it all look as it did - the movie is eye-candy, very detailed and true to what we have learned to expect from the games. The stunt work was also amazing and as trivia mentions 80% of the movie has been done without CGI including a stunt man performing the leap of faith (longest jump in ages lasting 3 seconds and reaching some 61 mph). To those who played the games: the movie's version of the animus was actually a better version than the ""lay me down and see the past"" device from the games giving a much more realistic understanding of how the skills of the ancestors would become the bodily skills of the descendant - i.e. through practicing those moves! The appearance of the holograms to others was a bit of a loose end but I hope the future movies might shed some light on this. I sincerely hope someday we can have such a virtual reality monster machine as the animus!"

Bad guys were on both sides and the leader of the Hashshashin order was the worst of them all (after all, the real historical Hashshashin order was a bunch of crazy fanatics who made Japanese kamikaze look like completely sane pacifists).Not so much in the movie which completely failed in this. The Muslim invaders are 100% good guys and noble, though rather weak benefactors of the assassin order. Christian defenders are evil through and through and they are the lurking force behind globalism.As a fan of the game series and its message, I'm extremely disappointed. It tore my heart to see Michael Fassbender's good acting go to waste in such a bad screenplay. I hope there won't be a sequel."

It had good film recording and had a lot of entertaining scenes and I am going to give myself benefit of the doubt. I thought the movie was very short and the plot didn't cover much. I felt like it was very short and could have been made into much better script. I admit I love the games but even though the movie could be stuck under that footprint there is no excuse this movie plot and script was executed with a lack of interests, they used some clips multiple times like of the eagle flying over the city 3 times. Either they had lack of funds to make the film or they didn't have the interests to make it. I feel like this film is going to end under the same profile as the Green lantern project. When it could have been under the same greatness as transformers, Marvel movies. The costume design wasn't much compare to the concept art that has made the game so cool but they could honestly made it better."

What will Callum do?""Assassin's Creed"" is an action film based on a video game. The screenplay is messy for those that are not familiar with this universe. The cast is top-notch; the CGI is amazing, but the screenplay could have been improved with a better development of Callum. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Assassin's Creed"""
" Too messy and dark
",-0.3612,0.9728,2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"As a action movie Assassin's Greed is solid movie. The story is interesting enough and entertains through the movie. Biggest problem of it is that it looks too much like a game. Maybe it is a good thing for game fans, but as a movie it is not good thing. It looks too messy and dark, just like you expect the game look like. As a movie I was expecting more good visuality for action scenes. If you have enough of to care to to watch the movie despite all the messy of it, it is quite solid action movie.As a movie made from game it is all you can expect. Not too clever and not too bad. It could be better if director has more rights to modify the story, but I think the studio bosses has told him what they and fans like to see. As a light sci-fi movie, Assassin's Greed is solid movie, but not enough that you need see it at movie theatre. In home you have at least a change to pause it while you visit at refrigerator."

It's based on a friggin game folks, if the plot was any less it wouldn't be one of the best selling video game franchises of all time. Get past that aspect, and this was awesome, and very well done. I must admit, I was worried, the sheer size and scope the game makes for a CGI nightmare, but they did very well I think, and Fassbender is perfect. Again, you don't have to have played the game, and if you didn't like it that's fine of course, but attempting to poke holes in the story and call it scattered or unbelievable is flat out stupid. Jog on, and don't watch movies based on FANTASY video games 👍🏼"

Yes they pump out installments with assembly-line precision, and they do produce somewhat decent open-world cities to explore. But the plots are the worst sort of pop-history pumped out by the finest accounting students who will work at unpaid internships. And the overall meta-plot linking the games together is the kind of tortured garbage that even Dan Brown would reject as too ridiculous for his style of books.Now take that ignoble heritage and make your typically hideous bad-translation-of-a-video-game style movie. Make it such utter tripe that Uwe Boll would be embarrassed to sign his name to it. Hand it off to a hack director and the most wooden actor you can find. Then throw all the money at the CGI team because all the movie-going public cares about is flashy FX these days anyhow.

The end result is you don't care about the characters or what happens. The main device in the film is very poorly explained and offers no intrigue so I didn't even know what they were fighting for, just some vague concept that didn't make any sense.

I didn't expect such a weak plot, though.The fight scenes were okay. On quite a few occasions I could not tell what exactly hit the bad guys and there were a few acrobatics that seemed so fake, like running on clotheslines – it was so obvious the actors were being held by wires.But even so, cool fighting scenes are just not enough. The storyline is not linear and I felt there were no proper explanations to what was happening. It actually seemed that a huge chunk of the movie was edited out. The characters were flat, I still don't get how the artefact everyone is looking for is supposed to work, the side characters don't add anything to the story and I am just at an utter loss as to how this got put together.Michael Fassbender and Jeremy Irons are pretty much the only upside to the movie, even though they were so grossly underused.

The original Silent Hill film was o.k., even Battleship was more entertaining then this yappy bore.Here Michael Fassbender plays Cal Lynch, a convicted murderer who, at the start of the film is experiencing a little Texas justice. Much to his surprise, instead of shuffling off to angel town he wakes to discover he has been hijacked by the Knights Templar, those go to bad guys used by any lazy screenwriter who can't spell Illuminati. Heading up Big Evil is sexy Marion Cotillard with visits by Jeremy Irons and his accent. Seems they snagged Cal because he is the decedent of a super 15th century assassin who was a member of the - you guessed it - Assassins Creed! That's the name of the film!Marion and friends want to use science to scan Cals DNA so they can recover the memories of his ancestor and locate a secret item that will end all of the violence in the world. Did I mention the plot is remarkably stupid? Turbo stupid.Anyway, the movie takes us from our present to flashbacks of 15th century Spain with lots of rooftop running and other acrobatics that must be featured in the game. These sequences are o.k. as are the fights, but they get pretty repetitive pretty quick.Back at home we meet a group of supporting characters who, like Cal, have recovered the memories of their past warrior ancestors and, like Cal, they somehow take on the various skill sets of these dead assassins and yada, yada, yada, none of them matter, we don't even learn most of their names. The 2 hour (!) chase to recover the 'artifact'- I won't tell you what it is it's just too moronic, trust me, you don't want to know - ends with a brief and pretty anti-climatic final at the London Templar Hall. Final thought, if the 'device' can end all violence why didn't the Creed use it themselves and ensure world peace? Or did they suppress it because an end of violence would mean the end of their order?Details.."
" Not quite hitting the mark
",0.0,0.5367,2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed the movie up till when the Assassins went to retrieve the Apple at that building. Him sneaking up and just assassinating the guy in front of so many people don't make sense! I was actually expecting the daughter to do it because then no one would think twice about her walking up. Yet a roomful of Templars and their security did not notice an Assassin in their midst. It was an anticlimactic ending definitely. Maybe it should have just ended when they escape with a promise to go after the apple in the next movie.Few other things that bothered me:-1. The Assassins law thingy - nothing is true, and everything is permitted. What the hell does that mean? That is broadest of broadest statements and it sounds like they condone crime, evil etc.2. The Animus. Having him act out all the memories, he pretty much had to climb a very tall building. In real life, he's bound to get a painful knock on the head when he reach the top, no? 3. So very serious! No humor, no fun, where are all the good one liners?4. Where are all the assassins? We see 2-3 in the flashbacks and no other assassins came to his aid even when he is surrounded at the end. So when the mom said you are never alone, that falls under Nothing is True. In real life, we end up with just three after one died so quickly. The Templars had a whole building full of followers who are very good at running out. Surely the membership to the Assassin's Creed is more substantial?Could have been better, and more satisfying."
" Is this a movie or a game?
",0.0,0.993,2017-02-25 00:00:00,3,"There is a problem with game-to-movie conversions: the game is based on interaction. In a movie the interaction must be accomplished through storytelling enthralling the viewer's imagination and bringing the story to life. At this, Assassin's Creed fails miserably.I review this not from the standpoint of a gamer, but of a movie-goer. As such I recognize the incredible CGI and design, the adequate directing, reasonable acting (as it was), and excellent choreography. But such things do not a story make.The basic premise of Assassin's Creed comes across to the non-gamer viewer as simply absurd. Throughout the movie there is no good-side / bad side. As the movie progresses the viewer finds it difficult to choose sides. On the one hand we have an order which wishes to dominate all free will. On the exact opposite side we have an order which believes all free will is acceptable-- including wanton taking of human life. Both come across as a plague upon mankind, neither side the hero, neither on the side of what is right. In the end game I got the distinct impression the world would be better off if both sides were completely eradicated and the rest of the world left to itself.The plot just never gains momentum, climax or resolution. The viewer never really gets what either the game maker or director is trying to get across. What point is being made here? Removing free will is bad-- okay we get that. Is wanton slaughter the answer? It is never established exactly what the Templars re trying to accomplish. Do they wish to bring peace to mankind or is their goal much darker? The plot never truly reveals.And what of the Assassins? Why do they believe that assassination is the only solution to all of this? What gives them the right to take human lives in order to promote their beliefs? What we see are two sides of the same coin, both seemingly fanatics, both excessive in the extreme.As far as movie making goes this is fairly well done, but in this age of computers one has to be a real klutz to mess up special effects. The ""set design"" was awesome, the CGI near flawless... but that is standard for the trade these days, taken for granted. What movies are coming down to is this: is the directing good, the acting good, do they tell a good story? In Assassin's Creed the director (evidently) failed to get across the point of the game, there was no ""acting"" to be offered by the script, and the story line was simply absurd.The action glutton / gamer / adrenaline junkie may find much to enjoy in this movie. Anyone else who spent good money to see a good film is likely to be both puzzled and disappointed... if not totally put off by the questionable and excessive violence."

Avoid. Avoid. You have been warned.This isn't to say that movies based on video games are 1 dimensional, boring and lame. Many video game based movie are quite enjoyable - like Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Doom, etc. This one is unfortunately just plain BAD (in the worst way possible)."
" Wait? Was it bad or mediocre? I think not..

Why do you think that all of that was boring? Well opinions must be respected, here another one for you to.Don't listen to the other people, watch the movie first and then judge it. This was the first game film I saw and I don't regret of it."

",0.0,-0.8071,2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"I've played 1 AC game and it was a fast walkthrough, i don't remember very much of the story. Well i thought this movies story was really deep and realistic. It almost never gets boring, it is filled with lots of action scenes and parkour. While the story never stops to unravel a interesting story and new moments for the characters.This might be the most underrated movie of 2016. When reading some of the critics reviews it is obvious, that they are to dumb to get the story even though it is not complicated. but today's critics and most people who base their jobs on watching movies and writing what they feel and not how the see the movie as a big whole. They often have very low intelligence. Truly cancer critics. please i dare you to get more distracted and dumb when watching a simple movie like this.. meh your life 8/10"
" Good enough
",0.4404,0.7953,2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,Actually I think the critics underestimated the movie. The movie really shows the war between the Templar and the creed. Interesting plot and unexpected things happen at the end of the movie. I've never played Assassin's Creed but I really enjoyed the movie. The movie will gradually bring you to the point. Enjoy!

And while the film tries to tell a story, its more or less about dead people who are enprisoned in a psyche ward of sorts, run by a father and daughter.The daughter I thought, was the office boss in Workaholics, but after studying the screen I guess she wound up being the same woman in the film ALLIED with Brad Pitt. So like the title says, its experimental enlightenment of brainpower and fantasy...where these dead people are used to acquire the KNOWLEDGE and ITEM of a powerful UNION or GUILD representing power. These folks are put into machines very similar to the films Matrix and Avatar...and reenact through adrenaline I guess movements and instinctual reactions relative to whatever it is they are seeing while being LOADED into this situation.And as you see, the other patients are a lil jealous by a newcomers presence and attention paid to him, but the thing that makes this different I guess is the strength they acquire to revolt against their captors eventually. I hated it and do not see the 125 million budget, I actually see Warcraft as having a star or two in better reviews...."

This movie earns its fame by the game and that does not follow its history is totally ridiculous and pathetic. DO NOT MAKE MORE OF THESE MOVIES TO MAKE MONEY,PLEASE, make movies that real fans and people enjoy, such as ""Warcraft"". 02/10.

Growing up with my younger brother, there were games that he played first and progressed far that I didn't bother playing and just actually watched him play and enjoy. The same is true for myself and other games. That way, we shared each others' experiences, kind of like the Animus. I can understand that those who never played, seen or experienced the game would have mixed feelings about the movie. It's extremely hard to cover all aspects and stories of the game in one film. Personally, I do believe they did an excellent job in the preserving the game's heart in the film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would like to see a second film."
" Solid!
",0.2244,0.993,2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Quite enjoyed this movie! I figured it would be bad like most movies made from a video game concept, but I ended up very pleasantly surprised. Fassbinder does a great job. Amazing choreography across the board. Very cool special effects. All in all a great action movie. And it makes me want to go play some of the games again. I sure hope this one gets a sequel."

Played the games and i quite loved them and now I watched the movie and i love it too, maybe more than the games.Now I regret not going to the cinema to see it when it was released. It seems that people assume all movies based on video games are bad and don't bother watching them before leaving a review."
" Better than watching game-play
",0.4404,0.9754,2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Watching this movie after reading some of the not-so-good reviews, was probably a good setup since expectations have been high and with the great success of the game.If you have been playing the game do not expect the same feeling, even though the movie reminds you of some of the game-play. For the most part it is the writers interpretation of the story behind rather than the game made into a movie. The story is quite uncomplicated with mostly 2-dimensional characters and straight forward action. It is best suited as a single category action movie, and when a good action movie is what you want this is not a bad one to watch."
" what a waste of time i regret watching it
",-0.6808,-0.9799,2017-02-22 00:00:00,1,As many others I played the Assassins Creed games and was looking forward to this film however it is safe to say that I was extremely disappointed. No matter if you have played the games or not this film was awful. First things first the script is poor. If I hadn't played the games I would have struggled to understand many of the references. The script is vague and confusing in parts which led to a man who sat in front of me leaving half way through (I wish I did the same). Although I am a fan of Michael Fassbender the quality of the writing meant he was wasted in this film. When it comes to the special effects the use of CGI was average. The fighting sequences weren't as good as I expected as it wasn't clear what was happening. The overall story was disappointing and the fact that there will be a sequel made it even more disappointing. I hate to compare but the games were good and the film was rubbish. I would not advise wasting time watching this. Please. For your sake. . . well i didn't wrote the upper review but i agree with him .. the movie just sucks it was just waste of time and money i didn't enjoy it at all bad story also bad acting i really don't recommend to anyone .. and i didn't play the video
" Please tell me this is just the DLC to the game and not the actual movie
",0.3182,-0.4753,2017-02-21 00:00:00,1,"Sorry but Fassbender's character summed this movie up best with: ""what the F- is going on?"". Serious waste of time and money, you would expect a film with an estimated budget of 125 million could at least hire someone better than a disabled cat to write the screenplay. But hey if you enjoy terrible story telling, shallow characters, a confusing plot, and terrible attempts at social commentary then look no further than assassins creed!"

" Upsetting to say it failed me
",-0.7506,0.9374,2017-02-21 00:00:00,3,It was only OK. Had the potential to be awesome. I play all the games over and over I love them. It feels like someone said I know the games are good but I'm a movie maker and I can make it better and failed. The animus don't even seem right to me either a big clumpy arm like that would not be able to keep up with his moves in real life and would have probably broke on the first go... (I use real life loosely lol) I had such high hopes I feel quite sad now. Let's hope the make another someday :)
" It was neither a good movie nor a good ""trailer"" for the game.
",-0.5875,-0.2822,2017-02-21 00:00:00,5,"I'll admit right now that I haven't played the games and nor do I know very much about them. I went in quite admittedly blind in hope that no emotional connection for a game would effect my opinion of the movie. That being said...It was neither a good movie nor a good ""trailer"" for the game. Very little happened and the story had little to no development. It was 115 minutes of poor character development at which I felt little to nothing for and the first 30 minutes of the film explained everything I needed to know making the rest of the movie completely void of watching. It was a compilation of cold, dry characters and very looooooooooonnnnnnnnnnggggggg fight scenes, that lost their excitement and honestly my engagement.It was filmed alright and the actors gave it their best to work with what little they were given, but overall it was nothing special and honestly failed in its attempt to get me excited about the game."
" Poor storytelling.
",-0.4767,0.9739,2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"I am quite familiar with the video game story, although I did not personally play it, I did watch it being played.From the beginning of the movie, I could tell the storytelling was going to be poor. With the editing and the way the movie started. Also, I do not understand why some movies that have a historical basis, sometimes get a rock or pop soundtrack in the background. It completely ruins the atmosphere of the movie. A proper orchestra soundtrack very much improves movies and really makes it memorable, as is the case with such movies as the Bourne trilogy, Lord of the Rings trilogy, Star Wars saga, Prince of Persia and so many more. The later music was mostly instrumental, but not enough of an effort to make you excited about what was taking place as a soundtrack should.I wish they put more effort into showcasing how the Assassins were fighting, or moving from building to building. But the way the editing was done for the majority of the movie, you see quick scenes to get the gist, but not enough to really show what is happening (except for one or two parts that were done decently). Some movies do this technique of short scenes more effectively, like Bourne Supremacy, or Bourne Ultimatum.The character development was very poor for pretty much every single character. We get no significant backstory or decent explanation for the main, or even the motivations of the villains or the heroes. Though we are told what the villains supposed motivation is, which is the eradication of violence, but towards the end, it does not seem enough to put on every single character associated. You are also not given enough of a background and motivation to like the ""heroes"" if that is what they are.The story is decent, but lacking in explanation of some key plot points, especially the main one, the Apple of Eden. I watched this with my brother and my dad. My brother has played or watched all the Assassin games, so he is just as much, if not more familiar with the story than me. We both had to give quick explanations to our dad to let him know what was going on at certain points, though there are parts we were just vaguely following what was being shown on screen. At the end, we are not even shown what the Apple of Eden does, except some green gas emitting from it. We are only told, it grants control to the templars of some sort. Though I have an idea from the video games, this needs to be told in some way in the movie.So in the end, I do not think this movie is very good, and is not that re-watchable. Nothing in it is that memorable to me, either the story, soundtrack, acting, or dialogue. Nothing redeems it in any way. There are a few interesting additions to the story, like Spain, the animated Animus, but not enough to help it. If you want a decent video game movie, you should check out Prince of Persia. That movie has a decent story, dialogue, and a good soundtrack."
" Just like playing the game... in a sandstorm.
",0.5106,-0.9818,2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"So, this isn't a very good movie. I mean, it has all the usual plot beats and set pieces you expect from an action movie, a decent cast, all the CGI you could want (rather too much as it turns out!) and lots of action very reminiscent of the game series it is based on.However... it takes itself far too seriously. Far, far too seriously. There is almost no humour in the entire movie. The entire cast play the whole thing not just straight-faced, but po-faced, as if they'd rather be anywhere else rather than in this film. The sole exception to this is Jeremy Irony, who plays his usual villain self with at least some energy. Everyone else looks like they are on downers.Then there is the dust... so much unnecessary dust. As the title of this review suggests, it is as distracting and thick as a sandstorm. Who knew 15th century Spain was such a dustbowl? It is so pervasive and overdone that it obscures the action at times and makes it difficult to see what is actually going on. At first, I assumed it was just an artsy effect, added in post via CGI to give the ""historical"" sections more punch. After a little while longer, however, I became convinced that it was added to obscure the CGI behind it. Now, after watching it through, I have no clear idea why it was thought necessary. Whatever the reason for it, it ruins the action in many places and makes the whole thing look badly filmed.And of course, then we come to the Animus. A machine designed to transport its occupant back into the memories of his ancestors. In the game, it is simply a sort of bed, or pod-like device. You get in/on it and get hooked up with wires and... that's it.Clearly, this was considered too boring by the writers, who had to jazz it up a little. I can see the conversation right now...""How do we make this Animus thingy less boring?""""What's popular nowadays? Ooh! I know... Virtual Reality!""""Cool! Let's do that!""So what you get is the occupant hooked up to a giant industrial robot arm which flings him about in response to what happens in the memories he is re-living. It is as ludicrous as it sounds, trust me. Of course, even that wasn't enough for the loons that wrote this and we are treated to outside observers being able to see what is going on via a kind of holographic projection effect.So proud were they of their VR Animus, in fact, that they constantly cut back and forth between the action in the past and the robot arm. They clearly decided that seeing Fassbender flung about on a robot arm was just as exciting as seeing assassins fighting in ancient Spain. Not that you could see the action that well, because of the damned dust, of course.The Assassin's Creed games did a far better job of getting even the story done. The movie, by contrast, condenses at least four games-worth of story into less than two hours, with predictably rushed results.It is all rather lamentable, I'm afraid. How do you take an action story about a war between Templars and parkour assassins and make it as forgettable and boring as this effort? Kind of at a loss to understand what the film-makers were thinking.And to think... people mocked Warcraft as a bad game-to-movie adaptation. I suspect we'll be spared a sequel, due to the poor performance of this at the box office. However, if they do go for it, I hope they just remember the old adage ""Less is more"", especially regarding the dust!SUMMARY: Bored-looking actors, excessive CGI dust, awful VR effects and a rushed story-line all combine to make this a very weak effort. Yawn-inducing, if I'm honest."

Regardless of the reasons, I've found a way to rekindle my love for playing games and decided that I should find time to also get to know the story better. Now, I've found the time to watch this movie and all I can say is the graphics and story line was definitely interesting enough. However, there were some parts that felt off or didn't seem to feel right. I can't absolutely point it out but, I must give kudos to how the whole movie was edited to perfection. I really felt like I was watching a game trailer instead of a movie though but, I hope this review passes as something close to a compliment. I suggest to anyone who plans to watch the movie, if you don't have an idea about the movie, am pretty sure you'd enjoy the action and graphics. If you do, and expect a whole lot from the franchise well, I suppose it might disappoint you but then again, I suppose everyone is entitled to their own opinions. What really matters is that if you enjoy what you see at one point and focus on it."
" back and forward mess
",-0.3612,0.8462,2017-02-20 00:00:00,4,"Trying to review the movie apart from the game series. Despite some good actors and Fassbender being one of the most promising actors of his generation, this movie is just a back and forward mess. Basically movie builds up until the man is tied into the machine, constant travels to the past and present without much of dialogue, explanation, color or substance. It would be a mediocre sci-fi movie, it is a mediocre game adaptation. By the middle of the movie I realized I was seeing the same sequences, over and over again, glued up with some sad excuse of a story, lame fighting sequences, CGI everywhere (but I expected that). The AC universe is so vast and rich they could have chosen a more interesting time-period, or at least develop ancient Spain a little better. I got the feeling Spain was a dusty cloud in a remote desert somewhere near middle east... do the writers know even where Spain is at? If this will have a sequel, I sincerely hope the sequel excels the original, cause this first movie is a mess. 4 stars for the main actors that alas couldn't turn this mess into the jewel it could have been. Lean something from the past, Highlander I is still the ruler of back & forward movies and a model to behold."
" The film was okay, but it also really lacked
",0.1154,-0.9439,2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"I understood the film perfectly and was enjoying it, until they offered what the Apple of Eden wasn't, and that was gimped, devoid of the same story line from the game's, missing its creation, existence, and threat.The Templars aim wasn't to control free will, removing violence in video game's making this film a juvenile certificate instead of the game's hardcore R ratings. The Templars aim was to control, ruling the World amassing all technology making them all powerful.The film missed out the codex's leading to how the Apple was discovered, it missed out on the message within it, from the ancient race who left it behind. It missed out on how it was forged.I didn't mind the introduction and the animus, but that crane wasn't the VR chairs. Although I understand how it made it easier to show the effects on film, with the shadows, and how she viewed him in the past. I am annoyed by the lack luster of this story, that rid the world of violence twaddle, the title is Assassin's Creed, stupid little things like after swearing his Assassin oath, he says to her, you can still stop violence. Hogwash it was really annoying.The film should have been the same rating as the game's 18, R. Drop that silly message of World Peace, freaking globalization yawn. That Apple was the key to the apocalypse and it needed safe guarding hence the codex's and the Assassin's order, but it is also why its maker's, the ancients left the planet. There wasn't anything inside of it upon its opening in London just big splashy lights, with the oh good the genetic blueprint to control freewill and stop the Assassins like they are two competing corporations, wrong, if you combined it with other artifacts it was a weapon and it also had a message within. I am also a little annoyed by the way the Abstergo facility didn't have those Assassin's through history nab him. They were all in lock down like eggs in basket, than they break out how predictable, instead of being an ancient order and kidnapping him or who knows how that story could have been seen. The story might have progressed in a set places for longer duration's like the game's when you're playing them in the past for a chapter gaining the codex's or killing a Templar seeking control, than back at Abstergo or outside the animus as the modern story catches up with its own time line. There just wasn't enough detail specifically in that past. It worked and it was easy to understand despite of it lacking.Not a bad film, enjoyable, hopefully they will do another."

Why do film makers insist they know better than game makers when it comes to telling a story!?! Please don't pay money to see this movie, you'll be throwing it away."
" Confused adaption of a decent Xbox game
",-0.3182,0.9682,2017-02-19 00:00:00,5,"An all star cast couldn't save this movie from being anything other than a bland exercise in moving wallpaper. Fundamentally I think they got the script wrong and misunderstood or willfully ignored what made Assassins creed the game stand out. Assassins Creed 2 (the good one that everyone likes) is about two things Ezio, the charming Italian assassin a lovable rogue and lady's man, and architecture, the stunning vistas offered up by the game and the remarkable realisation of what medieval Italy looked like from the eagles nest. This is not what this film is about. This film is essentially about Desmond or the much less fun part of the game set in modern times. In this respect the film could be said to be reasonably true to the game in that people tended to not enjoy those parts of the game and while those parts of the game did offer fantasy sci-fi elements they were the least engaging, most confused, most banal and heartless parts of the game.Ezio the character with all the panache and style in the games is essentially mute. There is none of the full blooded Italian man, none of the medieval culture, none of the heart and warmth. I suppose it would be a difficult script to write but I would have focused on Ezio, Italy and architecture more than topless Fassbinder, bloodless Brendan Gleason, and clichéd Jeremy irons. All fine actors, with good direction, a decent if somewhat predictable and pofaced score and fine camera work... let down by not filming the actual game. Comic book films had to learn how to change some aspects of comic books to make a good comic book movie but mostly that was in the optics not in the storytelling. maybe it's time to find a director that loves games and can direct to start making these movies... or maybe games make for poor movies as the stories are often game driven and not narratively driven... time will tell... this movie isn't it... but maybe it pointed some of the way."
" Better than what I was lead to believe
",0.4404,0.9953,2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"There is something fishy going on here.... Over and over I have heard how bad this movie is, how it flopped in the theaters, how nobody liked it, how it is too complicated, how even those who played the game wouldn't enjoy it. When I asked a theater if they would have it in 3D they said it would be a week, the whole underlying attitude was that the movie was so bad it would not merit any more time than that in 3D. It barely stayed in the theaters for more than a couple of weeks as I recall.It makes no sense at all. Not the movie, no, all this stuff being said about it and people's apparent attitudes towards it. I just watched in in the cheapest theater here in Vancouver, WA, in 2D. It has been at this theater for over a week. It is a small theater, no 3D presentations, no large screens, and sub-par sound. It does have the speakers along the side and they played the movie in one of their larger rooms. But overall there is absolutely no reason anyone would come to watch this, considering all that has been said about it, and that Doctor Strange was also here, along with Moana and Passengers.Still the theater was almost packed by the time the movie started. Seriously. The movie had been in the area, in 3D, for a couple of weeks a few months before. Then it had been in 2D. So people had something like three months to see it in better theaters, yet here they were, in the worst theater in the area. I watched the movie with my parents, and here is what I have to say, having played the first game.Many things are different between the game and the movie. Some things are the same, I.E. Templars are still the bad guys. But nothing in the movie is somehow more understandable if you have played the game. Well maybe other than you gain some general understand of the Assassin's Creed universe. The truth is you can walk into this movie with half the average person's intelligence and it will not be confusing to you at all. My mom and dad have never played the game, yet my mom understood the film and even enjoyed it. Now we are all pretty intelligent, but the story is very easy to follow and understand, all you have to do is pay attention. So whoever said the story line is confusing, complicated or hard to understand is full of the stuff your dog leaves on the ground after breakfast.The movie is not bad either. If you had to choose between this and Doctor Strange, the later wins out. This is a 6-8, just as it has been rated here at IMDb, while Doctor Strange is an 8-10. If you had to choose between this and the new Triple XXX movie, this is better. Honestly. This just has more substance, if not as much action. The new Triple XXX movie is pretty much nothing more than brainless action, and for some reason Vin Diesel is annoying as this character. I prefer him as Riddick. All this to say Assassin's Creed is very enjoyable, it has a good story and just enough action.To sum up... Ignore everything bad you have heard about the movie. You are being lied to. If the movie in its 2D version is still bringing in crowds all this time after its initial release, in a theater that has had very little updates since the 70's (look it up, the Regal Plaza 10), something is drawing people to it. Something is good about it. The numbers don't lie. The score here at IMDb isn't lying either. It's almost spot on.I think there is something else going on here, maybe political. In my area movies don't get to stay in 3D for very long, unless they are these animated things like Life of Pets and maybe Lego Batman. If it is a horror like Resident Evil or something like this movie, it lasts a week, two at the very most, and it does not matter how good the movie is. Some other agenda is at play here. I missed out seeing Assassin's Creed in 3D and I am extremely angry about it now, because there is no reason, absolutely none, that it could not have stayed in theaters twice as long as it did. From what I saw tonight it's a safe guess that people were still coming to it and packing the theaters when they shuffled it out for one of the million other 3D titles that all happened to be coming to the theater at the same time.I suggest we get together and speak up about this. Maybe Regal will listen to us and stop giving us the bum steer with these limited release times for 3D movies that have not made whatever list it is they have been given from Hollywood or whatever is going on. It would be nice if a Regal employee, someone in a managerial role, would be courageous enough to come in here and verify my suspicions. Tell us all exactly what is going on.I know this was not strictly about Assassin's Creed. But I have told you all you need to know. The movie is not hard to understand, it is well done, it is fun and interesting to watch, you do not need to have any experience with the games to enjoy it (my mom enjoyed it and knew nothing about the games.) It is well acted and it has a few twists you can catch if you pay attention. It would have been an epic journey in 3D. If you still have a chance of seeing in in 3D, do so.

",0.0,0.9501,2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"As far as good the concept telling is, and as not so is the story- line. We got an almost perfect movie from the conceptual side - all principles of the ""Assassin's creed"" have been transferred into the movie, and moreover they have been improved - the advanced ""animus"" is logically justified how the new physical skills can be achieved, plus all these visualized things can be explained by full immersion of Desmond, oh damn it - Callum. Scene by scene we are transported through the worlds, and that again how it should be done - not so much talking and then please to enter the animus and director lets us being watching actions as the main character experiences them. But as mentioned before the story- line at the beginning is a little bit strange and not better at the end, however in the middle of modern time narration - the explanations are available enough to understand what is happening and who are all these people around. Ancestor period is filled with atmosphere and actions and more harmonized than Callum line, but and this period of time lacks of drama and extended plot. Great actors cast is probably pulls out all the negative things that can be found in the picture, like the not plausible plot - it needs being extended, but the foundation for next part of the creed is huge, to be awaited, and for now is a good dedication..."
" Excellent Ubisoft adaptation ! 9/10.
",0.6114,0.9957,2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Hey what's up !Just saw this and wished to share my POV. I have been a Huge Fan of Assassin's Creed Games by Ubisoft (in fact I was supposed to work on them as I applied to work at Ubisoft Montréal many times to no avail..and would have worked on the great Assassin's Creed (a Canadian Montreal Games Franchise of Montreal Ubisoft). Still, no regrets, I loved this film - was SUPER COOL - the camera angles...WoWwwW...the camera angles are friggin-tastic...the camera does powerful sweeping movements over Spain Andalusia in 1492...it's so beautiful and somptuous (very value), Michael Fassbender plays a convict who is put down (lethal injection) and loses his former life, but he is revived and is forced to be used as a guinea pig at the Assassin's Creed Technological/Templars Complex. He must enter in a machine (called Animus), who plugs him with 'his past ancestor's DNA 500 years ago in Spain', when he is 'in synch' whatever movemetns he does in the present are transposed in the past, or vice versa. It's incredible camera work and the VFX CG are so well made; so are the costumes and sets - the Spanish inquisition of 1492 is deathly scary, we assist heretics burning at the stakes and Morion/Spanish conquistador armies fight...the search for a sphere that is said to contain the 'first germ of evilness in humans'...and the religious clergy keeps it tight as back in 1490s..it is the Muslim Moors (the Arabs who invaded Spain in 15th century) who hold it and at a certain point in the film; let's say Mr.Fassbender gets to Assassinate more then a few evil Templar people with many acrobatic moves and jumping/climbing all over the place - as said, the camera work is breathtakingly dynamic and powerful, we fell 'litterally floating' with the 'flying' assassins over Renaissance Spain. Marion Cotillard who helms the whole thing is good (if slightly too rigid/almost fazed-out/stone in her acting), but who's really good (as always) is Mr.Iron (Marion's Father), who plays the Complex Boss and who lies to his daugther and tells her the family is the Templars/Templiers (the rivals of the Assassins who for centuries have fought them to protect order). Exhilarating camera moves make this eye-candy and a like a extra-fun ride non-stop 'in a roller coaster'. The musis is great too, tons of upbeat music and scary deep atmospheric heroic music; excellent soundwork. Mr.Fassbender steals the show and is definitely the best acting one here (he is in the best actors when he puts all of himself in his acting, and he does so, especially playing his 'assassin' in the past - he is so solemn/silent...like silent deadly assassin).Great - Loved It, Ubisoft keep on making games, and movies (since many video game adaption movies don't fare well, this one does) !I give a great 9/10 (worth much more than measly 6.4)."

Heck, it would have been freaking epic as a period piece but let us be real, your average American movie goer doesn't like to read during an action flick. The studios know that so they threw in modern sci-fi BS and worked together a kinda generic storyline. I'm not saying this film should have been nominated for an Oscar or anything, but it isn't as bad as raging fans are making it out to be. There is an awesome scene somewhere in the middle of the movie that makes you wish the whole film was, whatever like I said, Americans just don't like to read. Heck! People are literally buying books in audio form. Moving on, the film sets up for sequels.. something tells me that isn't going to happen."

Walking into the cinema I was a little apprehensive, but this movie turned out to be amazing! I'm not entirely sure about other places, but where I live there was very little hype for this film which is a shame because I think a lot of people would enjoy it.It has an interesting story line, the action scenes are exciting and fast paced, and the character are likable, even the ones whose names you don't know. I'm not an expert when it comes to the games, but I do know a bit about them from having played them with my brother and I think that, from as far as my knowledge goes, they managed to make it very enjoyable and adapted it well for the cinema. Maybe if I knew more about the game my opinion would be different, but perhaps it would be the same. Game to movie adaptations are rarely good but I think this one might break the tradition. Whether you've played Assassins Creed, or have never heard of it, this is a film that I would certainly recommend,"

",-0.296,0.8973,2017-02-03 00:00:00,4,"I feel bad for not being familiar with the video games, seeing as how they're so vastly popular. This movie just came off as pointless to me and it looks like I'm on the side of the critics. I am surprised the score is this high. Okay, 6.4 isn't that great, but it's certainly better than most video game movies. I guess this was made more for fans of the series. I personally just find it to be monotonous and mostly boring. It tells the story of this guy who survives execution or is possibly brought back. He finds out that he's the ancestor of a member of a group of famous assassins.He literally spends most of the movie reliving the memories of his ancestor because he needs to find the Apple of Eden. This is apparently an artifact that will get rid of violence. This is actually bad because it apparently eliminates free will. I'm sorry, but this story didn't make any sense to me. I am fully aware of how beloved ""Assassin's Creed"" is and it does seem like it delivered what most fans wanted. Well, I don't really know much about them. The credits were 14 minutes long! That's some of the longest I've ever seen in my whole life! *1/2"

I can even buy into the whole terminator salvation bring a guy back from the dead after lethal injection to steal his memories or whatever, a bit different from the games but fine i will take it. as the movie went on it seemed further and further from the game plots and attempted to recreate what already works by making it new and more flashy. outside the Hollywood flare to over sell the action scenes, I really didn't buy the role of the character. Hard ass only out to help himself, then out of nowhere he turns his views because he saw a vision. Story branded like so many other movies, hell even darth vadar had a magical pivot moment from one extreme view to the other. This movie was on my winter watch list, I was stoked when I heard about it and couldn't wait to see it. I am thankful my ticket was free when I bought the bundle of games, I wouldn't have been happy if I payed for the ticket.Off to watch another movie, here is hoping that turns out better."
" It pretty much got right things to present in good way
",0.7269,0.9919,2017-02-01 00:00:00,4,Idea behind video series and this movie is pretty fascinating and seeing movie being made after much horrible ones this was pretty nice storytelling and presenting. After Callum is being sentenced to death group Abstergo Foundation saved him and now finds his connection with line of Assassin's. Base of the movie is to find object in past that contains code for free will and so they could control how humans behave which was pretty good one to start with. Now as movie goes it has ups and downs which are heavily felt from pacing that lacks momentum to some pretty unexplained scenes and plot holes. Idea behind Animus was also a good one but there are some things that don't have sense and deserve more explanation but overall experience is positive. How we discover more about society that world is focused and Assassin's it gets more interesting specially scenes that are in past. Some pretty big characters appear in movie and they have a power and knowledge to change a lot. Michael Fassbender was a great character in the and all credits for playing Callum only goes to him and his performance. Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons are both proved to be a interesting characters in movie and gave a lot. Movie has some kind of soul and greatness but considering that is was slow and had a lot of jumps that proved to be confusing at times it fails at one thing and that is to be entertaining for the whole period of duration. 2.5/4
" Finally an amazing video game adaptation!Perfect! Don't listen to the haters or the critics!
",-0.3561,0.9969,2017-02-01 00:00:00,9,"I truly do not understand why the critics bashed this movie, perhaps its because they have never played the video game before. I thought that this was hands down the best video game adaptation I have seen so far. This film was perfect, it had great action, amazing performances, and the cinematography was superb. I love how they made their own story, but yet they still stayed true to the historic aspects that the video game was known for, Michael Fassbender was ungodly epic as the lead, He is a perfect actor, and truly brought something unique and special to this film, something that only he could have achieved. The plot to me was awesome, I saw nothing wrong with it all. I implore you to not pay attention to the critics or the haters of this film, they know nothing and probably think that Nocturnal Animals was a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the reason why I think this film failed was because, instead of releasing this during summer and November they released it in December. Which was a bad choice, because even though it did not open the same weekend as Star Wars Rogue One, they still released it in the same month as a Star Wars Film, which ultimately held the box office for the entire month every weekend. I feel like if they released this film in August or November it would have fared much better in the box office. It saddens me that we might not get a sequel to this film, because it was perfect to me. I cant think of any flaws for this film. I hope Michael Fassbender just says screw it, and he will produce another sequel to this film. REASONS WHY THIS FILM IS MEGA EPIC:1) Michael Fassbender 2) Jeremy Irons 3) Very little CGI was used throughout this film for once!!!! 4) Cinematography was superb 5) The stunt work is some of the best I have seen in decades 6) They really did the leap of faith with a real stunt guy, instead of relying on fake CGI BS. 7) The plot was very interesting, and it kept me intrigued throughout 8) The Animus in this film actually made a lot more sense than it did in the video games. I loved how they updated it, its more practical and realistic. 9) Plenty of action and intriguing plot and performances from the cast. 10) It stayed true to the video game, it had all the parkour elements and they utilized the eagle as great symbolism which is a nod to the video games as well (which was all really done by stunt actors) YOU NEED TO SEE THIS FILM JUST FOR THE STUNT WORK ALONE, IT IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME!!! Compared to Marvel movies where half of their fight scenes are done with fake CGI, this film opted to go a real route and utilized 90% stunt work."

No explanation of what the VR machine was doing for or to the main character and after a very short time I did not care. They were burning people at the stake but no explanation for it. It did have a hole bunch of jumping from building to buildings but for what and who they were was never very clear.

There are a lot of cringy moments throughout the movie but a few that really feel epic and akin to the story mode in Creed 1 and 2.As a moviegoer, and from an objective non-gamer viewpoint, dear god it was terrible. The average person that has no idea about the franchise is going to walk out and ask for a refund.The action, I must say, is pretty great albeit for the ridiculous and cliché ""I know martial arts and I'm fighting police officers that AREN'T USING GUNS"" parts.

" Kinda liked it but needed a lot more to compete with the game's story
",0.191,-0.461,2017-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I was not expecting much from this movie because Hollywood tends to take things that are brilliant and cut them down for ""everyone's size"".While that was partially true in this movie as well,I was not completely disappointed.It took the base of the game,did not add many of the things that made it the miracle it was,but instead added some things in order to become attractive for people not associated with the franchise at all.That is the main reason this film could have been a lot better.For starters,the animus was a completely unnecessary change.The fact that they gave our protagonist his ancestor's blades for the simulation was a totally Hollywood aesthetic thing to do and it seemed silly.It would seem silly even if I had no idea about the what I was seeing.Since it is a simulation,even if he was wearing a superman costume,would make no difference.Secondly,why did they have to speak Spanish?I do not understand why they had to deviate from the original story.I would love if we had seen some of the known characters.And to be frank,sure a lot of people would go to see this movie,but the main crew would be gamers and fans from the franchise and the games.So why not emphasize on things these people would appreciate?Third,we did not see anything of the first civilization or the creed's origins,nothing about the brotherhood's formation,ariarchy or purpose.Fourth,the apple of Eden was discovered so easily and while it contains so much power,during the display it seemed like a cheap gadget that produces blue light only capable of impressing children.Five,during the fight inside the memories,when the assassin hold captive the priest and the black knight had his woman,why did he withdraw his blade from the priest's neck only to stab him in the leg a few seconds later,ensuring,that way,the death of his comrade? Made no sense.Six,we had no explanation,of what I can recall,of what was happening in Spain during that time and they throw some Turkish prince in the way out of nowhere.How did his father come to possess the apple and after getting it,why did the assassin just gave it away like that?Seven,why did Spain always seemed like a windy dessert from Africa?Everything gloomy and dusty.Didn't seem like Spain at all.8,no decent soundtrack.And many scenes had totally unfitting soundtracks like the one in the beginning with the eagle.9.We saw no one in abstergo experiencing any of the side effects of the animus,only some silent men and women with grey eyes.10,I do not think they know when and what desynchronisation means and happens.11,many scenes had no sense like the scene where his father died or when,towards the end,he was seen by the daughter,she did not reveal him while she knew what he(our protagonist)was obviously going for,but after he killed her father she was all surprised and sad and wanting revenge...Like,what did we just see there?Also,why during the last assassination did he not stab the abstergo master in the throat like he should,showing the signature assassination move and just slit his throat instead?It was a letdown....12.The assassin's costumes were so inferior to the one's in the game.The colours and weapons could have been much better.All in all it was a fun movie to watch,with nice battle choreographies and action scenes but very superficial compared to the game's story.It made me think that the director had not played or read any of the games/books.I really hope they fix things in the next movies and do some proper research because this story has the potential of becoming a magnificent one..Otherwise it will be another Hollywood fail that no one will ever talk about again, after it's done it's course in theaters."

There are intense shots which make you live the most pleasant and longest ""cinematic"" of them all. Of course, at times, the scenes turn silly, but non the less the content continues to entertain the audience. I felt like I had emerged into a gameplay on a big screen. The story was easy to follow. And there was also effort put into the main characters. Secondary characters were not given as much attention, but I would love to see more of them in a sequel. I enjoyed the movie a lot. Yet, do not take my opinion, but seek if its of your particular taste."
" Awesome game adaption!
",0.6588,0.9484,2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I felt the Assassin's Creed Movie portrayed the games to a very high standard and even some of the slight deviations added more energy and weight to the Assassins Creed story. The Assassins and Cal's background could have been initially introduced better throughout the start of the movie as it was quite jumpy and rushed in certain areas. However, the balance between the Assassins and the overshadowing Templar Order in the modern day Abstergo facility was undoubtedly incredible. The descendants of the Assassins (prisoners in Abstergo),having or having obtained the Assassin values initially appearing as a threat to Cal is highly effective in revealing the underlying motif of the story, which is the conflicting ideologies (Assassin's Freedom and Templar's Control) fighting throughout history in a bid to both keep/achieve their goals/morals. It is never made certain to whom is really doing it right (it does however, lean towards the Assassins though as it does in the games).Personally, the greatest scene in this movie (and I mean it was so revelational and enthralling) was after Cal had achieved full synchronisation with Agulair (although it never went down like this in the games) and the historic Assassins (and parents) began to surround him as the modern Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was being restored.This tribute is definitely on par with the story in the Assassin's Creed games which recognises the Brotherhood falling and being restored throughout history with certain iconic historic events and people."
" Best video game adaptation
",0.6369,0.9709,2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"As an Altair and Ezio Auditore's follower, is quite hard for me to give bad feedback about Assassins Creed. The plot is superbly well-made, with a story that mixes historical facts with technology. It's quite futuristic but it makes us think about serious stuff like ""Are the Templars descendents alive, amongst us?"" and ""What are they planning for Mankind?"". Fassbender does a great Callum Lynch/Aguilar with great physical performance and acting skill. Marion Cotillard keeps up with his pace. The scenarios are well designed and this movie has the ability of making us travel in time. The only negative point is related to the movie duration. Such a rich story should deserve a trilogy, so that the viewer could understand the Order of the Assassins' organization through time."

The end was terrible, I was confused and nothing made sense. Too bad, it started so good. They should have brought in King Kong at the end to fight the star, instead he fought himself or somebody else who might have been him in the past..maybe..they fought about something that might have been stolen .... then retrieved then stolen again..I think... I am not sure what happened at the end. It made no sense.Conclusion: I should have stayed home and watched youtube or NFL Gamepass."

",-0.4927,-0.4216,2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"This is about the worst movie I have seen in the last year. It's not often that I want all of the characters to die quickly. It's also the first Fassbender movie that I've not enjoyed in any way.The story meanders. It's filled with characters I really don't care about. The flashbacks are impressive feats of practical effects and physical endurance, but, they bore me to tears. It's the usual ""over the top"" ninja warrior crap that we are sick of seeing. The only difference in this movie is that there is a male ninja warrior for once.Marion Cotillard is usually superb in movies. What was she thinking? Her role is political correctness in overdrive. The father lavishing her with praise because she's a female? If Cotillard wasn't asleep through boredom, she would have ditched such a pathetic attitude to her character that a father would NEVER say to a son. The movie was filled with this sexist crap (eg. trust a MAN to take the credit for what a woman did). It's nauseating. The director clearly has gender issues.If there's one thing that Justin Kurzel (the director) got right, it was the female Asian assassin (we had to have). She wasn't 10x stronger than any other character.If you are interested in physical effects, plenty of sexism, boring characters and don't care about story, this IS your movie. If you like relatable characters, a believable story and don't want sexism rammed down your throat, this is NOT your movie. I really should have given this movie 1/10 but the practical effects upped the score."

I haven't played the game and had no idea what the film was about. But none of that mattered Wha really stood out was the SOUND , this movie deserves an Oscar , I have never experienced such amazing sound in a movie , it really enhanced the experience in 2D , in 3D it must be even more enjoyable .

" A very dangerous movie
",-0.5256,0.9242,2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Don't get me wrong, technically it's a well done film. Cinematography is first class, CGI are as good as they come (not surprising), and the actors perform their roles to perfection. But that's not all that makes a movie worth your while. The script is based on platitudes, and very often sounds like a series of slogans, I found it almost hard to understand how the actors managed to deliver their lines so well. But all these good qualities just serve to make this movie more dangerous. It makes it harder to realize how simplistic the bottom line is, if it looks so good, and has such fun action scenes one may well fail to notice what it all said. I know it has a dangerous potential because I felt the same when I saw Vendetta, I even wrote as much on a different site (it was very long ago). But the future has proved me right, just as the popularity of the Vendetta masks keeps on rising. It was a well made movie that justified terrorism, by creating an over simplified situation in a hypothetical world, and by glorifying a very shady character from British history - Guy Fawkes.So what do we get here between the slogans? - We get the dangerous idea that we have to make a choice between two fascist ideas. Between religious fascism and an anarchist form of fascism. No other option is presented in this movie, moreover if there seems for a moment some hesitation by any of the characters, they all convert to this simplistic world view by the end of the story.Even more dangerous than this over simplistic world, the film is based on the idea that god has created a tool to end all free will. While this might be true of different forms of religious extremism in almost every big religious faith we know about, none of these religions really believe so. In fact all religions are based on the believe in free will. If there's no free will, there's no personal responsibility, and all religions lose their validity. So the whole idea of the Apple of Eden is completely bogus.I know, most people going to see Assassin's Creed, don't give a hoot for any of this, and won't even notice that this is the conclusion stemming from the story line, but in my opinion, this just makes it more dangerous, and is even a stronger reason to point this out. So go ahead hate this review all you want, that's what I think, and that's what I write."
" Shocking Movie! How can people give this a ten? I'm curious, please tell me how?
",0.372,0.996,2017-01-23 00:00:00,1,"First of all: I'm a huge fan of the games (especially the 2nd'game) I was a bit worried this would give me a biased view towards the movie, but I decided to leave my thoughts about the games at my doorstep and approach this as a neutral and not become blinded by my fandom.I'm positive i managed to do this.My mate (not a fan of the games) decided to join in after he read a lot of mixed reviews about the movie, especially here on IMDb, where people tended to give it either a 10/10 or a 1/10 score. This caught his attention and he decided to give it a go.He regrets this decision now.As the rating showed, there is a big difference in opinion about this movie.If this is due to the large fan-base of the game or the content of the movie, is not something i am going to speculate about.However, what i will say is this: I seriously DO NOT understand how people can rate this movie any higher than a 6 at max. Even if you are the biggest fanboy ever.Nothing in this movie gives a feeling of anything remotely close to a perfect score of 10: Not the acting, Not the special Fx (although not bad), surely not the dialogue, Not the characters and certainly not the story.To me, what i got presented was a big lukewarm tomato soup of a movie, missing any real context, with a few nice moments at best (the chasing scene trough the city was well made i thought) in a mix that at most generous might be categorized as ""action-driven-entertainment without any real point"".It surely can't be categorized as factual history,knowledgeable, realistic or anything else like that, but that is well known as everyone who played the game knows that its built on fiction.The problem with this movie starts here: It goes forward in a way that it tries to combine the two elements of video game and movie without finding the correct balance. The result is a semi realistic world we have a hard time relating to and that seems unrealistic and fake.It works in the video games, but on the big screen it just does not cut it, and this is particularly down to the story, which lacks depth.When you think about it, the games are much better versions as well: they tell the story over far more time and trough interactive experience which gives it the necessary depth to be believable, vivid and successful.When you try to minimize all this into 2 hours of movie, something must be sacrificed, and the first thing that suffers is the story.It becomes rushed, force-full and a bit cheap.The Second thing that struck me was the acting: Michael Fassbender gives us an uninspired performance, but does what is demanded from the role. That means that you don't really get a lot of compassion for his character on a deeper level, but just enough to cheer him trough the movie. Just enough.One thing he did manage for this movie, is being physically fit and at least manages to look pretty bad-ass. This kind of saves his role and he gets a plus for the fighting scenes as well, as i thought he executed them in good style.His lines however is just not personal or interesting enough and gets forgotten in a split second . They don't stick. A shame really, because i think he could have made a decent character with some better dialogue and deeper character creation. The back story we get presented is rather paper thin and don't do the character any real justice.Marion Cotillard plays the scientist, responsible for setting up the time travel and shows a very similar figure to Fassbender. Uninspired, but saved by good looks.She simply does not impress on any level and reminds me a lot of the role she gave in the The Dark Knight Rises as Miranda Tate.Just forgettable. I will admit it: i am not her biggest fan, but i seriously expect more and think we as consumers should expect some sort of passion to be showed from actors that get paid well above the average. All in all a Bland performance.In a short summary: none of the characters gives us anything else than average performances.Michael Kenneth Williams known as ""OMAR"" from ""The Wire"" makes a desperate visit as one of the assassins but fails to deliver anything else memorable besides a bad joke.Brendan Gleeson Plays the father of the main character and also just delivers what he needed. nothing more. he sort of just is there to collect his Pay-check it seems, nothing more.The only thing this movie does successfully in my opinion is this: Bring a Video Game to ""life"".However, this do not make it great in any sense.There is way too much lacking in terms of general quality.I don't want to spoil too much and i think i already have got my point across.If you disagree and gave it a 10/10 rating i would really like to hear what your arguments are for giving it that score.You certainly must have seen something i did not."
" The Video Game movie curse continues
",-0.5423,-0.9691,2017-01-22 00:00:00,3,"I genuinely thought Assassin's Creed was a high chance to once and for all break the video game-movie curse.A loaded and potentially thrilling subject matter, an A-list cast lead by star and producer Michael Fassbender, an upcoming Australian filmmaker taking the reigns of his first big budget event after impressing with back to back films (check out Australian film Snowtown for one truly eerie experience), Assassin's seemed to be lining up all its element's correctly but sadly this unsuspectingly dull event and wannabe franchise starter is another sad and sorry entry into the video game adaptation cannon.To say that all of Assassin's is a failure would be a disservice to the few things that do work. Some action moments show off the films potent possibilities (the whole idea of accessing your assassin ancestors memories is still pretty darn cool), but so much of this overly serious production fails to capture the imagination required for this story, and there's likely to be more movie goers falling asleep than getting excited come screening time.Anchored down by a laborious and unnecessarily complicated script that makes it awkwardly hard to follow what on earth is happening, as Michael Fassbender's charisma-free Callum Lynch gets drawn into a dangerous world of assassin's, apples and scientists, Assassin's Creed fails to capture the audience as promising director Justin Kurzel's lacking direction is brought down lower due to some totally misguided cinematography work, a bombastic score and some downright intrusive editing that seems to suggest the filmmaker isn't yet ready for the big budget marketplace.Also harming the film's chances of being a success or at the very least being understandable is the film's cast, but with a confused looking Fassbender leading the charge none of the supports from the likes of Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons or Brendan Gleeson get to do anything of note, although many of the worlds greatest actor's couldn't make Assassin's dialogue or plot line work.Not the worst video game movie of the last few years but certainly the most disappointing, Assassin's Creed might show tidbits of a better film and it's forays into the past are often exciting but far too often Assassin's is quite simply a boorish chore that fails to encapsulate what made the gaming series such a hit and showcases Hollywood still cant grasp the essence of taking video games and turning them into a whole different beast.1 and a half monitor watching employee out of 5"
" Amazing adaptation
",0.5859,0.9898,2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"i do not normally review movies, partly because i cannot be bothered. So far the reviews i have been reading have got it spot on, the movie is an absolute masterpiece. Not once was i bored, great job. The acting felt believable and the director managed to catch the movie in the best angles.Do NOT listen to bad reviews as they do not know what they are talking about. I for one have owned all play stations and played all of the assassin creed games and can say confidently that it did it justice. Bravo to the team for this great adaptation. NOTICE the word adaptation, considering that video games never really fits all the pieces needed in a movie, the script was done nicely. I cannot wait for the second one. GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE, you will not be disappointed."
" Not a terrible movie, but not a good Assassin Creed Movie either.
",-0.3252,0.9976,2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"So the long awaited film of one of my favourite game franchises comes to life on the big screen, and fortunately with Ubisoft, one of my favourite game developers behind the scenes every step of the way. Does this mean we're going to get the film fans deserve? Or does it unfortunately fall to the curse of games being churned as a movie? Why is it so hard to beat this curse that's plagued films like Resident Evil, Street Fighter and Need For Speed. Is it because games are an interaction, immersing you into the plot more than a film would, playing out the story, where as a film just shows you the way, telling you how it happens? It's a hard challenge to accept for any director or studio to take and you can read more about games on the big screen in my blog here (though currently a little out of date) do they make a film purely for the fans? a film that will capture and be appreciated by non-players? Or try to achieve the balance of both? Which is what I feel they attempted to do here. Justin Kurzel is the daring director who reunites with both Fassbender and Cotillard from his visually stunning and artful Macbeth, a style that is very prominent this film too, with heavy use of smoke and moody slow-mo which suits the presence of the Creed. The core of the Assassin Creed story is there but the tweaks really ruin any good progression. The game's plot has a certain level of romance, an air of authenticity, it's historical nature was something the whole series really prided themselves on. This was lacking from the film, as were the locations which, in the games play an incredibly important part of both the story and gameplay. The film done away with this almost entirely. The games were so accurate to a degree that when I visited Roma, I could actually get myself about the glorious city without a map, purely because I had spent many gaming hours running around the virtual city in Brotherhood. The first game was modelled on Jerusalem, followed by Venice and Florence in the second, my point being that these iconic landmarks played a massive integral part of the Assassin Creed stories yet the film did nothing, in fact, purposefully avoiding key cities the games had previously visited. As with the locations, they've done away with the characters from the original plot line. Michael Fassbender plays Cal, an orphan of the Creed's bloodline but he's no Desmond Miles, not even an Ezio or Altaïr and there doesn't appear to have any scope to introduce these characters. Not that I disliked her before, but I'm becoming quite a fan of Marion Cotillard who plays the daughter of Abstergo CEO, the company bent on using their groundbreaking technology to get what they're after. The animus itself is complete different from being a recliner, maybe to shy away from The Matrix and not just to add dramatic affect but it is a step in the wrong direction creating an unbelievability in an already super fiction world. But all this is coming from the opinion of a hardcore gamer and shouldn't taint the viewing pleasure of a non-player. My friend who's never played the games throughly enjoyed the film because he couldn't, wouldn't have, picked up on the alterations. Something they did do right was the fighting and the parkour, dedicating ample scenes and sequences to the action style famed from the games. It's superbly captured and quite creative actually rekindling that ""awesome"" gaming mechanic that actually makes me want to pick up the controller and play. Another good thing to come from this film is the score from Jed Kurzel and it had listening to it after the screening. Tracks like ""Abstergo"", ""The Animus"" and ""The Regression"" are all amazing and worthy of the game/film. Gladly the film lacks a soundtrack, not to ruin the ambiance of the film, but the few tracks it does play actually fits well. It's already fast becoming the Suicide Squad of 2017, but don't get me wrong, I was disappointed with Suicide Squad as much as everyone else was, and even though my actual write-up pretty much contradicts my overall rating, it's actually far from being the worse film of the year; and Assassin's Creed is very much of the same ilk. The film has some great elements, just like Suicide Squad, and no, I'm not comparing them, simply stating how both have been received by critics and viewers alike. There's a great score from Justin Kurzel, some amazing action sequences and plenty of nods to the game source, obviously Ubisoft very heavily invested in the film; but it just doesn't hit it's target. It tries to be an Assassin's Creed movie, it's a not a bad attempt, and though I would be willing to see where they go with this, hoping for Brotherhood, Black Flag and Syndicate, it's unfortunately not what I would call a true Assassin's Creed film.

" Even my grandmother liked it... really,she did.
",0.4215,0.9795,2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"So, basically, this movie can be described as... everything the Resident Evil movies should have been instead. While we don't see any of the original video game's characters, this movie still retains the atmosphere of the universe it was based of. The fight scenes are amazing, as well as the parkour chase scenes, that are very faithful to the parkour chases of the games.One problem I think people may have with this movie is that there isn't much exposition. Well, I agree, but to be honest, if you ever played 1 Assassin's Creed game, at all, you can understand the movie perfectly.The scenes that make reference to the games , such as the scene where Aguilar cuts his finger (Not spoiler, it's the first scene) are just so damn cool.~~~~Now entering spoilers area~~~~Cal was a very interesting character, and seeing him go crazy from the animus really reminded me o Cle from AC Revelations, which probably was intentional, which once again was awesome.A little thing I noticed, though is that... the Apple of Eden was kinda small, compared to it's size in the games, but it's easy to overlook, so nevermind.The movie has good scenes, and a storyline that is very good paced, even though it centers more on Cal than Aguilar, unlike the games, that center on the past more than the present, it still is one of the most well-done adaptations out there.~~~~Now leaving spoilers area~~~~Overrall, if you're a fan of the series, you're definitively going to like this movie, if you aren't, then just do some light research on the series' lore and you'll like it anyway.Highly recommended, and nevermind the critics, this movie IS good."

",-0.0772,-0.9464,2017-01-22 00:00:00,4,"Spoilers ahead The action scenes were poorly filmed so it was confusing to look at. The only characters that some kind of motivation were the villains and the main character changed his mind without any real motivation or character development.The only thing we get to know about the main character is that he is violent, he is the ancestor of an assassin and that he killed a man. That's it. Everything that he does feels unmotivated and that's because there's no character development in the entire movie. Story 2/10 Action 5/10 Acting 5/10"
" Good for non-fans, bad for fans. Reasonable for everyone
",-0.1531,0.8835,2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Finally, the live-action version of Ubisoft's acclaimed game arrives in cinemas, and it appeals more to non-fans than fans, which is not a big problem. I went to the cinema with an expectation down there, I was expecting to see a horrible movie, and I was surprised, I did not see a bad movie, and not a big one, just an ""Ok"" movie that delivers what it promises and nothing more. With a first fabulous act ""assassin's creed"" is completely lost with the passing of the plot, the second act is normal and the third is weak, the story of the movie and the game differ, but not bad, not only better fitable for A visual audio media, it is sad the scenes in the time of the rebirth will be few explored, in the moods, we only have action scenes rampant, these action scenes that are very good in the first times, but later it gets repetitive, although the scenes of parkour, Even ""weird"" media work very well in the film. Michael Fassbender has his moments, as in the scene in which he is going to be killed by lethal injection, but at other times, it is a simple performance and caricature, with a soundtrack very good and technically good in visual effects, although the visible chromatic . In the end, ""assassin's creed"" is not a big disappointment, at least for me, it's a reasonable movie, good for non-fans, and lousy for fans, it's worth having a Sunday afternoon at the movies"
" Full Synchronization!!!!
",0.0,0.9943,2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,"Being a huge enthusiast of Assassin's Creed I really enjoyed this movie!When I first heard that it was going to take place 30% in the past and 60% in the modern world I was so excited because as much as I love the past and human history it is more interesting and relevant to see the corruption and dark truths of what our world faces now. There is a really great scene involving Irons talking with the Grand Master of the modern Templar order (they call her some other fancy name but really, it's she's the Grand Master) about how people's comfort and selfish desires makes them weak and dependable on more ""responsible"" and ""wiser"" figures to tell them how to live better lives through media and consumerism. Right on the nose........ I think it did a fantastic job simulating the feel to say a watered- down version of George Orwell's 1984 involving a scene of Micheal (Callum) standing on the edge of an open cell window, no bars or trampolines. A fall to death is the only escape.Being such a dark and gritty story, I can only think of two humorous things in the film. I chuckled once, than flatout laughed. It involved the apple of Eden. The fantasy elements like the apple of Eden hold just enough interest and mystique without giving too much away.The movie took risks and helped push the boundaries of the Assassin's Creed mythos and I felt the movie did not talk down or betray the entire concept of the story with poor writing. I felt treated as a respectable viewer.If there are a few things I could critique is that I felt surprisingly the movie did not have a long enough running time so that more characters could develop more. I felt the shots of the eagle soaring through the sky a little over done but that is what trial and error is for!Ubisoft seems to have this bad habit of killing off too many female characters in the series (I'm looking at you Unity) I don't know why but it's weird LOLI'm so happy I went to see the movie as an early Christmas gift on opening night. I could seriously talk for pages why I loved it so much but I feel like I said what I wanted to say. Definitely going to buy the movie when it comes out!I hope this will get a sequel. all in all, great recommendation to true fans of the series.Take a leap of faith and use your eagle vision to see its true intentions!!!"
" sobersided theme and dull representation makes it less interesting.
",-0.0754,-0.939,2017-01-20 00:00:00,5,"Serious. Stylish. A grandeur of visuals and jaw dropping parkour stunts, but that's just about it, as the movie, despite of its promising cast, failed to balance the amount of grittiness to such enthusiasm.The stellar cast seemed auspicious, no doubt they were all good actors, but their efforts are all thrown away by its dull script writing and if you already saw Macbeth (2015), which also stars Fassbender and Cotillard, you could actually see potential for another epic tandem.Although 50 percent of the film are a bit confusing, in which you'll get caught up of the amazing fight scenes but once the conversation resumes you'll have to think of what happened before that, which in a way that the disadvantages of the film when in comes to story telling are being settled by its decent action pieces.The movie itself makes more sense the second time you'll watch it however with its sobersided theme and dull representation makes it less interesting."
" A movie based on a video game done right.
",0.0,0.9912,2017-01-20 00:00:00,10,"I've heard all sorts of bad things about the movie, that there's too much Spanish, too much action outside the Animus and many more, but that mattered little since I stopped listening to critics regarding a movie a long time ago. People nowadays have strange expectations when it comes to movies in general, they want them to be as real as possible or want the movie to be according to their views. But enough about that, lets talk about the movie and the movie (in my opinion was great), to be honest, it was way better than I had originally expected, there was enough action inside and outside of the Animus, to me it seemed like they balanced it well. I absolutely loved the fact that they decided to have the actors speak Spanish when the story was focused on the assassins. I'm a fan of the video game series and I can say I'm glad they didn't use Desmond Miles as the main character and went for Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) who is now the lead for the movie. There are loads of easter eggs for the fans of the video game series which they'll definitely notice. The cast was great, I mean you also have Jeremy Irons as a templar (I'm almost certain he actually is a templar in real life) and Marion Cotillard who was wonderful and the all cast was great. And Michael Fassbender was a great choice for the main character, he was freaking awesome.All in all I'll give this movie a 10 out of 10 for it's genre, because it deserves to. It surpassed my expectations and all the bad critics it has. To all the people that wanted to see Desmond Miles and Altair in the movie, I'll tell you that if you did it would have been simply dull and uninspired, this new character refreshes the series and brings about the possibility for new stories and I can't wait for another movie."

In the Bible that I know they call or translated to Portuguese ""The Apple of Disobedience"" as ""The Fruit of Science Knowledge of good and Evil"". And the movie fits perfect. Because are the Evil Scientists who are trying to ""KILL"" the human Liberty or Free will. Or at least the science was being used for that! The movie put Religion, and specially the juzsys guys, as a BAD guys!! :):):D I like that, they really are BAD. They try to control the lives of people they manipulate. And even the words can be manipulate. Like Godspeed! What is godspeed? Google.com translate it as good luck! But are there words as ""jesuspeed"" or why not ""Satanspeed"".

Great soundtrack in there as well, which has some pretty awesome themes. Go and see this movie, it balances story, effects and action really well, and generally this is one hell of a thrill ride. One thing that Inwould say though is that they should have spent a bit more time in the Spanish Inquisition, but other than that. NAILED IT!!!!!!!"
" Very poor
",-0.5256,-0.601,2017-01-17 00:00:00,4,"I haven't Play the video game, I only saw the movie, but honestly, I think It was a very poor movie. The story was inconsistent, it had very boring scenes, the acting wasn't good enough and the plot... It just doesn't work out. Nothing is explained. And what to say about the characters? They didn't developed any characters, so the viewer can't empathize with any of them... At the end of the movie, it leaves you a sour taste in your mouth... because it looks like there's going to be another movie. In conclusion, don't waste your money. This is my personal opinion, from a person that saw the film without having play the game."

The action scenes were alright I guess but everything else was just boring. The plot was also quite incoherent. The plot extended if very many different straws that was eventually knotted together but you didn't really care because I was just hoping the movie would be over soon dye to how boring it was. The finale was pure bullshit and anti-climatic. They just show up, get done whats need to be done in like 2 minutes and they just got out of there like nothing happened. To slow, to boring and to anti-climatic, don't bother with this unless you're a die hard Creed fan, although, even then you're very likely to be disappointed over this movie."

Needless to say, I'm not very invested in this franchise.I'm familiar with the concept of the Animus (a machine that taps into your 'genetic memories' and allows you to see the events of your ancestors), so I had already suspended my disbelief when they plugged Michael Fassbender's character into it.Assassin's Creed was a mediocre action film, and for a film based on a computer game franchise, that's probably high praise. Personally, I didn't particularly like or dislike this film, and that probably tells you all you need to know about it.If you're a fan of the series you will probably enjoy it more than I did (and you will also spot the little Easter egg they throw in).

The film's rhythm, cinematography and music pulled me right in. I also liked the plot not being over complicated and very straight to the point. There was plenty of depth and nuance provided by the character performances and the mood in which everything was put together. I also loved the theme of free will as viewed from a past and present perspective and the theme of free will juxtaposed against morality and law and love.I left the cinema stunned and with my faith in film making restored. I hate to see this film so baldly reviewed."

",-0.2846,0.9681,2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,Could have been a great movie.Being a game addict I quite didn't enjoyed the movie.Despite of the stunts this movie lacks conviction where as comparing the game.The movie could have been better if they gave more importance to the past memories and mend a story in the past then this movie could have gone to just another level.Since all were expecting to see more of Fassbender in the hood rather than in prison.Those who have played the game understands that most of the game happens in past and the story is built so beautifully showing the rivalry between the Templar's and Assassin's perfectly.Where as the movie somewhere in its journey just forgets to portray.Apart from that the stunts are awesome and especially the Animus caught my eye. Hope if there is a sequel they will consider this and give us an ultimate Assassin's Creed experience.
" Needs more of everything, doesn't have much time for it
",0.0,0.9894,2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"I was expecting complete catastrophe of a movie judging by reviews and various metrics but the movie was kinda whatever-OK.Main problem is that AC lore got so big and complicated that an hour and a half just wont cut it for a movie. AC The Movie is somehow too simple and too complicated at the same time. Main story is simple, everything else is unexplained or without proper context. But it's a necessary start, I guess. And Ubisoft was probably testing the waters with this. They got their money back and despite being and underwhelming movie, I hope we'll get a sequel that's more polished and coherent. Just like the first game was ""meh"" but then Assassin's Creed II just knock it out of the park.Acting was OK, CGI was ...eh, could be better, setting was a bit dour and uninteresting. Actually, last ~30 mins were way better visually than the rest of the movie. Music was OK, but nothing memorable unfortunately.Assassin's Creed: The Movie didn't break the video game movie curse, however, it wasn't insultingly bad garbage of a movie, like few of the latest Resident Evil movies were. For example all the Spanish parts are in Spanish, which is refreshing. Fights were usually good, and running sequences were nice. Fassbender looks cool as always and I wish we got more of Ariane Labed.If you see it, it'll probably be OK, and if you're a fan of the games, you should see it, but all in all, you are not missing much."
" Hard to creed
",-0.1027,-0.8986,2017-01-16 00:00:00,4,"We don't need case studies anymore to know that video game to film adaptations are dead on arrival.Fresh out of a somewhat successful adaptation of Macbeth, the powers- that-be pulled Kurzel, Fassbender and Cotillard for another adaptation with the hopes of a similar result. The overwhelming negative backlash seems to prove it hasn't paid off. What feels unfair in this whole process is that we've all come to blame this genre as cheesy, uninspired, shallow and uncommitted and while Kurzel fought against that in every aspect the result completely backfired. Ultimately confusing, bland and disjointed, Assassin's Creed pulls you away at every narrative turn. Halfway through you'll be lost, counting the minutes passed and most of all wondering what made such acting talent - backed by underused and visibly lost Irons and Rampling - take part in this mess. While Kurzel's brother Jed's score manages to provide the right feel, Justin swerves from interesting cinematic and beautiful shots, to muddled and hazy cgi shots that become tiring after 5 minutes, let alone the whole duration."

Action scenes are awesome, especially sound was marvelous. After watching too much cgi action of super heroes movies, this one is like a real, lovely breeze. And yeah, the leap of faith was good. All characters have reasons and those developed OK, just a little rush I can feel.I will go and watch a second times with my girlfriend, screw those reviews making me hesitate to take my girl together last time.

It is quite a violent movie but because the graphic details are largely omitted it comes over as a good action movie with a fairly interesting plot Callum aka Aquilar is spared execution despite his violent history to assist scientists studying the genealogical associations of violence. Callum's Spanish ancestor was a member of the Assassins Creed who battled with the Templars for ownership of the Apple of the Garden of \Eden. Actually in modern times all everybody in the movie wants is the Golden apple and Callum sees his name written all over it, but for all the right reasons. I loved Michael Fassbender's solemn hero, and he is quite the action man. Cotillard was a great foil as the scientist, and Jeremy Irons suitably villainous as her greedy father. Moody Spanish landscapes of 500 years ago mixed splendidly with modern settings and subtle editing and beautiful photography made this quite a memorable movie. Historically it seemed full of inaccuracies, but who cares, this is first rate entertainment."
" I'm Crazy. Crazy for feeling so hopeful
",0.2362,-0.725,2017-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Video game based films seem cursed. Film makers just can't seem to make a decent movie out of such hit games like; Hit-man, Need for Speed, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, World of Warcraft or even Super Mario Brothers. Many attempts, all failures, it appears as if we may never get a good video game based film any time soon... Or will we... Like an eagle from a viewpoint, Ubisoft comes soaring in with the announcement of an Assassin's Creed movie. Starring Academy Award Nominee Michael Fassbender, and Academy Award Winners Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons, and directed by the man behind 2015's critically acclaimed Macbeth adaptation, could this be the movie we've been waiting for, to end the curse??? The answer to that question is the biggest NOOOOOO!!! Humanly possible. Not only is Assassins Creed a really bad film, it also takes away all hope that we will ever get a decent film adaption of a video game.It's hard to know where to start with this film as so many things were oh so very wrong. Personally I felt the biggest problem of the film was its script. Firstly the film takes place predominantly in modern day rather than in the historical setting the animus takes us too. The fans want to see Aguilar not Cal Lynch. We want to see assassin's running rooftop to rooftop, stealthily taking out targets, but no, instead we get Michael Fassbender eating a steak and singing the aptly named song 'Crazy'. Not only does the narrative look like the filmmakers don't even know their audience, it is also extremely hard to follow. The dialogue does all it can to ram exposition into your head, but there is just so much made up science and theories to take in that you just stop caring altogether. The film may be confusing but that doesn't make it clever, as most of confusion stems from the fact that what they are doing, or saying, or creating is simply illogical and heavily flawed.Speaking of heavily flawed, what in the absolute f*ck did they do to the animus? The animus itself is enough proof to show that the filmmakers didn't know what Assassin's Creed is, let alone who their audience is, and will completely disregard the source material and all logic just to use more CGI. Seriously how does the animus go from a chair to a mechanical bungee cord thing? Like why does Cal Have to act out all that Aguilar does? But more importantly, what happens to Cal when Aguilar is running in a straight line or riding a horse? Does he just hover, riding the air like an idiot? This is where the film complicates things that were otherwise simple in the game. If you wanted to use more CGI then you should have probably featured 15th century Spain more.As I have already mentioned, this film stars Academy Award Nominee Michael Fassbender and Academy Award Winners Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons. Or should I say Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons because their performances are far from Oscar worthy. It's surprising how badly these actors perform considering that they are often top of their game. Instead of their A game we get a dull shell of who the actor is.To equal this review out I should probably go on about the films redeeming quality if it has one, and for Assassin's Creed it does have one. The action scenes are the best bit of the film by far, but the film finds ways to ruin this as well, thanks to the overly fast paced editing and 12a certificate rating. Assassin's Creed is a 15 rated game that has escalated to Pegi 18 with recent instalments, so a 12a rating really takes away from the enjoyment of the film as it constantly cuts away before anything graphic can happen. The editing is also really fast in the films action sequences, making it as hard to follow as the films narrative. It is obvious to me that the 12a rating is purely for commercial reasons and so there is nothing to truly enjoy from this heavily watered down movie. This is the movie equivalent of getting a drink that is 90% ice 10% drink.Overall, Assassin's Creed is a poorly written, poorly edited, poorly produced, poorly acted, over complicated cluster f*ck. This is the worst film of 2017 for me and I saw this on the 3rd January. As a fan of cinema and video games in general I am left broken from disappointment and fairly certain that this Hollywood curse is one that will never be lifted."

Michael Fassbender, Justin Kurzel and Marion Cotillard, alongside director of photography Adam Arkapaw and composer Jed Kurzel, had the infinite credit of trust after the terrific Macbeth.The goal was enormous: to destroy the wall created by a great lot of mediocre adaptations of video games, and punch the way to the heart of the audience. This mission was made up by the critics and the audience, while the ""mountain of talent"" was just trying to create a great movie. So what happened after all?At the output we get the picture that caused a lot of debate, but I certainly loved it. I believe that many criticize it simply because it doesn't meet their personal taste. And so in this review I will try to describe not just an opinion, but also to find objective pros to the film.It has one huge advantage, which, for some reason, is overlooked by many viewers, critics and bloggers. But I always appreciate this item in any picture. Thing which is called artistry. An attempt to create art. Trying to create something original, without following an established formula of blockbuster productions (hello, Disney). Trying to ""decorate"" your movie, bring it its own flavor, the atmosphere. And this is where this film fully succeeds. But some people, accustomed to the standard ""stamped"" blockbusters (just try to give McDonald's patrons something from Italian or French cuisine), are not ready to accept particular vision of Kurzel, But I do not think it hurts it in any way. Conversely, this is kind of advantage. Kurzel once said that he created his own film, not a video game adaptation. His goal was to make a movie that would not depend on the success of the video game, establishing itself in the field of cinema as an independent work, although happening in the universe of the game and having it referenced, including some of the characters. Is this bad? Of course no. But the fans are people who sometimes don't lend themselves to a logical description, so many of them cries about the movie not having the standard Animus, the standard characters likewise Desmond, Ezio or Altair, and everything else. The film features only the original music, a very impressive one, by the way, if you listen to it. It may not seem so memorable at first, but personally I can't forget several motives after a couple of days after watching the film.Unfortunately, as many have noticed, the script really leaves much to be desired. But it is not as bad as many says. The film is set in our days, in our world. In order to understand it, you need to know what kind of world we live in. And then the words about violence and control won't seem so meaningless. The problem of violence and control are, perhaps, the most important issues which mankind is facing today. Turn on the news and check for yourself, and then maybe the idea that a senior scientist in one of the largest corporations in the world, not limited in any resources, possessing the idea of ​​the search for ""cure for violence"" will not seem such a fantastic thing. Has someone a doubt that the people of ""higher tier"" trying to control the ""inferior""? Well, maybe the quality of education, the intellectual level of mass cultural products and career opportunities really fall from year to year by pure coincidence indeed. Of course, it is easier to dismiss the word ""nonsense"" than think about what is not on the surface. But is it really your choice?Kurzel withdrew the auteur blockbuster, and it is shown not only in the breathtaking visuals created with the help of the DP and visual effects studios (though at the absolute majority the film was shot on camera), but also in the atmosphere. Actors very harmoniously complement his vision as well. Michael Fassbender is good in the dual role of Callum and Aguilar, and convincing in a variety of scenes with his character. Marion Cotillard played very convincingly a challenging role for any actor, a role of a character who is neither a hero nor the villain. Jeremy Irons opened his villainous potential to the full, just like Charlotte Rampling, although she has, on a par with Brendan Gleeson, only a couple of scenes, but both actors have coped with their roles, and I hope to see the character of Charlotte in potential sequels. All the other actors also can be commended, especially the unique Ariana Labed. In many respects thanks to them the script looks better on screen.Although, I admit, there are some disadvantages in the movie. In some places, it lacks logic, but it's still a sci-fi film, and something can be forgiven. Fortunately, the plot holes and mistakes are not so conspicuous. But the main drawback is the run-time, and the consequent rush. I hoped that the film will be more lasting, like 140 minutes which was reported before. Unfortunately, it feels kind of confusion when the events occurring on screen, the characters move too quickly from location to location, the characters do not all have time to open up, even though the actors are trying as hard as they can.""Assassin's Creed"" is a film which requires a certain mindset on it. It is darker than most blockbusters, and maybe it features too much authorship, the vision is too strong for an ordinary moviegoer chewing popcorn. But is it bad? In our age when it is so rare to meet a blockbuster with a director's hand on it, so rare to see a different thing? For me it is clear: I liked this movie, and I hope that someday we will see the sequel.Thank you, Justin Kurzel and all the incredible team working on it, for such an immersive experience."
" Assassins creed was excellent
",0.5719,0.8163,2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,i think its a very different movie from all others and that's why people didn't like it ! i know the game really well and OK the movie its not really like the games but whats the point of having a movie exactly like that game and i think peoples should be more opened cause its movie was sooo different from all other finally! but u guys don't like because its strange to see something different and new from what we were us to see on the movie XD thas my opinion so i give it a 10 even if i think they should try to put a little bit more action ! there was not a lot of characters but that not rally important and i hope that this will become a saga cause i really want to see more !!
" Assassin's Creed ShowMeTheMovies Review
",0.0,0.9946,2017-01-14 00:00:00,2,"https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/The video game franchises' movie adaptation manages to convey a less interesting plot than the games themselves; Fassbender was very much an overqualified actor for this role.The Assassin's Creed franchise has always been plot driven - alluding to apocalyptic storytelling about Mayan influence, templar rule and long-line ancestry of assassins. When converted into a movie, one would expect this to enhance the detail as much as the story can muster - sadly this couldn't be further from the truth.If there is one thing I could compliment about Assassin's Creed, it's that it put in a great deal of effort in remaining true to the franchise. Anyone who has seen or played the video games will see that Michael Fassbender does look exactly like one of the assassins, there is mention of many important plot details from the games such as the Apple of Eden and the Templars, and many of the camera shots are designed to look like the games did. Too often has a video game to film adaptation completely lost all relevance of its original plot: Doom, Resident Evil and Street Fighter to name but a few, yet Assassin's Creed has managed to remain true to its brand. This, however, comes at a great cost - which is completely detrimental to the overall film quality. The camera shots during action scenes are genuinely awkward and jarring, making it difficult to actually focus on what is happening in front of your eyes, and the mention of important items in the games felt more like a checklist of things the director was required to mention rather than adding relevance to the plot: the assassins did cite the Assassin's Creed for example, but there was no given reason as to how the vow ""nothing is true; everything is permitted"" relates to the assassins in the plot.The plot follows main character Cal Lynch (Fassbender) and his Spanish ancestor Aguilar, who Lynch can access the memories of through the use of a device known as the Animus - another callback to the video game series - where Lynch will re-animate moments from his ancestor's informative past. Lynch gains access to the animus through an organisation known as Abstergo, who save Lynch from being sentenced to death and contain him in a facility to extract information from Aguilar's life using the animus. Of course, Abstergo are gaining this information to use maliciously, and to ultimately control the will of humanity by finding the Apple of Eden within Aguilar's memories, which has the ability to control human nature.Now, a similar story does take place during the games, but it takes up until at least Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (the third game in the series) to fully explain all of this - the Apple of Eden is only revealed in the last act of the first game - whereas the film attempts to cram as much of this information in at one time, so it is likely anyone watching who has never played the games can't keep up or feel that the story is rushed: which is exactly the case.Dramatic moments during the film do not feel as substantial as they are intended because every part of the film tries to add a new twist constantly: particularly the ending, which is supposed to be a surprising cliffhanger, yet I found myself not caring about any of the characters or their motives at all by the bitter end; if every moment is meant to be dramatic in the movie, then nothing stands out as intended.The acting quality is also not great - Sofia (Marion Cotillard) is the leading scientist on the Animus project, and Cotillard clearly tried her best to work with the material she was given, however her characters' permanent expression was always worried, making Cotillard incredibly underused. Essentially any actor could have played Fassbender's role(s); Lynch was incredibly bland, and Aguilar had barely any dialogue (and since he was also played by Fassbender, he didn't look like a spaniard as he was meant to) - unlike in the games where main character Desmond's ancestors were completely different people and did not look exactly like him.Overall, Assassin's Creed would definitely not be on my watchlist, and it is riddled with faults. The plot does clearly open up for a sequel, which will need to step up its quality in order to make me even vaguely interested."
" 1h 55min of ""huh""
",0.0,0.9977,2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"So confused and so hooked on the same time!  First is first: I never played the game, no idea what was about before walking in the cinema, but I still enjoy it! And girls, if you think is a boy kind of movie, think again! I can promise you there will be at least something that you will be happy you saw ;) I bet playing the game is a lot more exciting then seeing the movie, because, my friends, really expected a lot more from the movie.  Myself , as a non player, I find it enjoyable, action scenes and chase scenes are very good and fast paced also, the cast and crew did one of their best work on this movie, and to be honest I find hard to believe anyone can say the visual effects weren't really good! Despite critic reviews and reports expressing their concern on yet another video game spin-off attempt, I can honestly say that not seeing this movie in theater would truly be a mistake. The movie does a pretty good job explaining the series myths to those unfamiliar with the games and also it keeps you on your toes. Assassins Creed is by no means perfect, but I did enjoy it and I will happily see it again!"
" Well.. it was OK.
",0.4466,0.9779,2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"I first saw the trailer and I was quite excited, but I had never let my expectations get too high before I went to see a movie. I went into the cinema in a very neutral mood. I have played all the games though, and therefore I knew the storyline quite well already.I liked the movie! They put a lot of work into making it look awesome, and I saw great acting. There is a ""but"", however.Here we go; But, I wasn't shocked or surprised in the movie at all. The death of the female assassin did not feel very sad because we hardly knew her. The storyline was predictable because I have already played the games, I did not find any new spectacular element in the film. The storyline included a lot of items that were not fully worked out in the movie, and that made it a bit confusing, especially when looking at every characters motive for their actions. Kyle only spends little time in the animus and that is also quite a shame. It is just... when you make a movie about a video game, please add something we've never seen before. Make it special. Because then I'll give you an eight or even higher. But now I can only call it decent."
" It isn't so bad as it could be.
",0.5549,0.9643,2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"The movie has turned out average what here to hide. The atmosphere of original games is almost not transferred. The plot develops promptly, but his giving is quite crumpled and some twists are simply far- fetched. Characters are registered poorly, though cast is excellent. Scenes of fights and actions are very good. Suits are picked perfectly up. Also I really like some Easter Eggs in this movie.I can't deny that this film can not be pleasant, especially to a casual film-goer, but if you're a fan of the game I don't think you'll walk away disappointed overall."
" A Lot More Enjoyable Than You May Think
",0.4927,0.9937,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"Expectations are more important than you may think.For example, a lot of people I know said this was just a boring and interesting video game adaptation with no real redeeming qualities. Others said it was a fun time. So I just went in with no major expectations, besides what I know of the games. And in the end I was actually surprised and thoroughly enjoyed what we got. I mean its not perfect. In fact some aspects are actually pretty bad, but most of them have to do with the story. First, even though this is far from his best work, I kind of enjoyed Michael Fassbender, even if he was somewhat distant in this. The action is probably the most surprising part, that being it was really well choreographed and had some cool looking parkour segments. I also liked the aesthetic the film was going for. Many of the shots are almost entirely silhouette and it fit with the theme of ""assassins working in the dark."" even though they are almost always in daylight in this film. Finally the score was really nice to listen to and helped heighten the tension of some of the actions scenes, rather than feeling generic.Now there were some not so great aspects. One thing was that some of the performances were pretty stiff. Mainly they just felt a bit forced at times and they didn't work very well. The biggest issue I have is definitely the dialogue. There were more than a number of some unintentionally hilarious lines.""I understand its your birthday.""""Yeah. And the party's just getting started""But considering this is the first video game film I've actually enjoyed, even for its flaws, its was actually a really fun watch. I even feel inclined to watch it again. Who knows maybe this rating will change on a second viewing. So far this is my biggest guilty pleasure film from 2016.P.S. There was no stupid music like they had in the trailer. There is something like that but its brief and in the beginning so that was a relief.68/100"
" Just awesome!
",0.6588,0.7523,2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"First of all I don't watch trailers of movies I KNOW I'm gonna like. Period. Hence: No spoilers, no fake promises, no fun taken away. Second, I'm a girl and I've played most of the AC games (some of them multiple times).The result: A breathtaking, beautifully detailed, perfectly presented film in graphics, music and acting/ stuntwork. Can't imagine how fantastic it's going to be in 3D!I give it 9/10 stars but that's just me losing the plot-line a couple of times... AC is rather a galactic story, also based on/ mixed with real events and the story of the movie is quite different to the one in the games.All in all a true homage to the games and I'm just blown away by the results and can't wait for the next part to come out. Bring it on!"
" Fantastic but little explored
",0.3182,0.8529,2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"I'll stay. It's a big film, It action, history, emotion and thriller. I think that it was little explored, my expectation was three hour of film. It was left with some gaps, example, because in moment of the her judgment or better after of the judgment, explain as he arrested. It could also be told a bit more about the other characters or their partner. I liked of the film but I did believe that need more time. The explored more the mysteries involving the apple and not only the apple. The history in the past was well counted but in future the things happened very quickly. It must be more time to strengthen the order and think of a plan to redeem the apple. Anyway, the movie is not what the critics said."
" Very good!
",0.54,-0.7229,2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"Why should we not rely on criticism? Well, I went to see this movie with the head in the criticism, and I broke my face. The film is very good, well elaborated action scenes, the transition of scenes is very well done, and the continuation of the story is well done. The Hate that this movie brought is basically from the same guys who said that the movie ""The Witch"" would be the best horror film ever, the most monotonous and slow movie I've ever seen in terror (which has no terror) , People who hate ubisoft and games will see the movie just to create fake reviews and speak badly for the sheer pleasure of simply being a hater. Go see the film and believe only what you are SEEING!"
" Assassin's Greed For A Good Movie
",0.0516,0.4493,2017-01-12 00:00:00,1,"OK, I love AC games and the whole AC universe. The first game was a bit boring but thanks to Ezio's trilogy I learnt this wonderful world and have been experiencing till today, in AC comics.And I found this movie such a generic borefest.This movie just took some tropes of AC universe, served 'em as a mediocre fan service, through generic action scenes full of crappy CGI, in a Madrid like AC 1's desert for some reason, and that's it. There was no mystery, no interesting characters -except the black guy who I do not even remember his name!- and the ost WAS TERRIBLE. This movie even had three top actors and still, could not use'em well! Probably that's why Fassbender went all out ""crazy"" in the only scene I memorize from this crapfest. The script was so bad that came back & forth to past & future without leaving room for characterization.I honestly have no reason to suggest this movie to anyone. Not even to AC fans... The worst AC game or comic has more interesting story than this... Let's just forget this snoozefest and hope that, if a sequel will occur, will be with different characters, script and such.AAAvoid!/10Equally disappointing to WoW movie..."
" An unexpected treat for everyone
",0.4019,0.9861,2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"The only video game-based movies that I can remember didn't suck too much for me were Warcraft (I actually liked it, more than any of The Hobbit movies), Prince Of Persia (better than most people say), and this movie. Sure, in the beginning it may feel a little slow, but it fills that time with proper character development and background, so even people that didn't play the games can easily keep up. I liked almost every aspect of it, from the solid performances by every actor, to the soundtrack, to the plot, to the action sequences (although they are a little scarce), to the cinematography (albeit the dark, gloomy style may not be completely of my taste), etc. I have completed some of the games, and I gotta say it is a pretty accurate film, too, with most of what people love from the franchise. Something worth mentioning is that it also leaves audiences expecting a sequel, while also being a solid standalone movie. All in all, go watch this movie, you won't be disappointed. It is one of the best (if not the best) video game adaptations to date."
" Great chance missed
",0.5994,0.3016,2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"For anyone that has played any of the assassins creed video games prepare yourself for disappointment. For anyone else I suppose it's not as bad. I thought the film would be split around 50/50 with the amount of time set in the present day between time spent in the animus (in the past) as his ancestor, with maybe slightly more in the past. However Cal (main character) only spends around a quarter of the film in there. My main gripe though is with the way it is filmed. Watching it is like watching a cinematic version of the game, it's not realistic at all. Everything is CGI, I don't know if the parkour is CGI'ed or just sped up but it doesn't look real. At least with the games they based it on human movement whereas the characters in the film look superhuman. Also for some reason in the wide shots over the city in the present and past the place is covered in a cloudy smog giving it this darker fantasy look. They have tried to make it like the film and have gone over the top, and they have missed the point that it's a film not a game. On a final note there is hardly any dialog especially when Cal is in the animus making it give the impression that the animus is just a side note of the story whereas the games and the books are primarily set in the past. Disappointing."
" A poorly executed leap of faith.
",0.4215,0.9948,2017-01-11 00:00:00,5,"Assassin's Creed is directed by Justin Kurzel and stars Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson and Charlotte Rampling.When Callum Lynch explores the memories of his ancestor Aguilar and gains the skills of a Master Assassin, he discovers he is a descendant of the secret Assassin's society.Does Assassin's Creed have what it takes to be a great adaption of a beloved video game franchise? Yes. It's fast-paced, visually satisfying, features a great cast and showcases a huge amount of practical stunt work. Does it succeed in being a great adaption of a beloved video game franchise? Unfortunately not.Director Justin Kurzel aims to captivate the viewer with staggering visuals that are blissfully aided by a beautiful backdrop, but an unfortunate misuse of 'smokey' ambiance covers the picture with an undying darkness. With 80% of the film being shot in-camera; stunts, locations and all, it angers me that so frequently throughout, we are pulled from Aguilar's past to be force-fed exterior shots of present-day Cal in the animus, ultimately disjointing the flow of these expertly crafted action sequences, if only to tell us that Cal is still in fact in the animus. It becomes noticeable around the first half of the running length, that we do not feel or care for our characters, removing what made the video games so vastly enjoyable. This could be due to multiple script rewrites but as ambitious as the film tries to be, it never really builds up anything but the foundation for a possible sequel. Performances from Cotillard and Irons are underwhelming. Gleeson looks out of place. Fassbender saves his role with an impressive amount of stunt work, of which he actually performed, wearing an eye-pleasing costume which has been wonderfully designed by the hard-working individuals in the costume departments.A large chunk of the film is shot on-location in Malta and Spain, with incredible set designs and vibrant colour grading, which is something I appreciated and gladly enjoyed. But as aforementioned, the cuts between Aguilar and Cal feel jarring and inconsistent, leading to an unnecessarily difficult watching experience.The original score by Jed Kurzel feels uninspired. Using repetitive string and brass 'sweeps' that occur every time there's a noticeable change in an action sequence, overall lacking any innovative material. Though there are some ravishing visuals and magnificent landscapes, the storytelling just doesn't evolve into anything worthy of praise, and in doing so fails to engross viewers. Verdict; Huge potential can lead to disappointment, as shown in Kurzel's ambitious Assassin's Creed.Assassin's Creed, 5/10."
" Bloody awful movie - avoid
",-0.7964,-0.991,2017-01-11 00:00:00,2,"I'd seen reviews of this film already that should have warned me, but I went anyway.It felt like almost the entire movie was in the dark or in smoke. It's not clear if that was to hide bad CGI, to hide some of the violence to get a younger rating(?) or just bad direction. It was genuinely difficult to see what was going on in lots of the movie.For no good reason in an *action* film large chunks of the dialogue were in Spanish with subtitles. Why? The plot was worse (and worse explained) than the normal AC backstory I've seen in the games, and the exposition bits were so disjointed and badly written that it didn't hang together in any way.I can only assume that Ubisoft offered Fassbender, Cotillard and Irons a *lot* of money to be associated with this."
" Worst movie I've ever seen
",-0.6249,0.9037,2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,It was the worst movie I'd ever seen. Watched it with my boyfriend we both agreed it was absolutely dreadful. I've seen Marion Cotillard recently in Allied and I love the actress but even she couldn't save the movie. I did really like the music though that was one good thing about the movie which helped me bear it until the end otherwise I would have walked out.It is very uninspiring and stifling and too serious ALL the time. There was not one heart-warming moment in the film or even just humour. There are a few exciting fighting scenes but after some of it it begins to feel very repetitive lacking imagination and variety.The plot is somewhat ornamented but the skeleton of it is overly simple and far from being interesting enough to be the kind that grips your attention. So in summary it was quite boring.
" Amazing
",0.5859,0.9816,2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"This is what movies sometimes are about - full on entertainment without having to think too much about complicated relationships or historical background and I wasn't disappointed. I have already watched it twice. It's a very cool movie, great action scenes and even my daughter who has played all the games loved it. The cast is also excellent and easily get the audience involved and into this incredible world of the assassins creed. The music behind the action scenes is perfect and kept me on the edge of my eat throughout the whole movie. I can't wait for a sequel and honestly compared to Star Wars Rogue One I'd go to watch Assassin's Creed 3 more times without hesitation."
" Such a let down!
",0.0,0.9429,2017-01-11 00:00:00,2,"After loving the Assassins Creed franchise for many years and enjoying playing the story's of the majority of the games, I had high hopes for this film especially with the $125 million dollar budget and the huge actors playing the roles of the characters such as Fassbender and Gleeson. But honestly the actors I didn't think performed and showed there true talent in the film its almost as if they showed not emotion in there acting. The story of this film merely didn't make sense, The frustration in my head they could have made such a better story line. There was way to much time out of the animus when the majority of Assassin's Creed fans wanted to see more time of the ancestry of Aguilar (Fassbender). A quote from the film to sum it up is ""WTF is going on""!!!!! Wouldn't waste your time or money."
" Tight Choreography, Gorgeous Visuals, Seat-shaking Soundtrack, Engaging Story
",0.7506,0.994,2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"For those unfamiliar with the games, Assassin's Creed follows a brotherhood of assassins who's work transcends time. Modern-day descendants are sent back via genetic memories in order to uncover a mystery in the distant past; this time 15th century Spain. Callum Lynch is the latest descendant caught up in this war in the shadows, thrust into a mysterious facility, hooked up to a machine against his will, and receiving odd looks and treatment from fellow ""prisoners"" for reasons he doesn't understand.While I've heard this as a criticism a few times, for me one of the story's strongest points is the blur that is good and evil. The Assassin's Creed has a world-changing artefact hidden away in their possession and the Templars want to use it for their own gain. It sounds clear-cut, but character's motivations are decidedly shrouded in mystery, making it harder to tell who is on who's side. Callum is thrust into this war with no knowledge of what's going on, and naturally gravitates to the side that manipulates him most (unknowingly), but is that the right side? By the movie's end, he makes his choice, while others make theirs, and the lines between who is right and who is wrong are blurred into various humane shades of grey.Which actually leads me nicely to my next point. Assassin's Creed makes a point that neither Callum, nor his descendant Aguilar are superheroes. While they may be the most well-trained and secretive assassins in history, they're still human, make mistakes, and take hits. Most of the action takes place in 15th century Spain, with Aguilar and his fellow assassin Maria escaping the Templars and taking the artefact into their own control. The action is driven by high-functioning choreography and exquisite parkour, and needless to say looks fantastic, but while it's style-over- substance approach looks fantastic, it doesn't forget to hit with a punch. Every punch, kick, and stab is felt, by both the Inquisitor's men, and the assassins themselves.Of course these sequences are where most of the visual effects and cinematography praise lie. 15th Century Spain looks amazing, with breathtaking sequences over canyons and rooftops. Dust and smoke permeates almost every scene, giving it a gritty, rustic look that envelops you, and the skyboxes of dramatic clouds and beautiful sunsets set a warm glow over the proceedings. Most crucially though, there's a near-absence of CGI, used only to create the gorgeous vistas. All the stunt- work is in-camera, all the sets are stage-built, and the movie looks all the more realistic because of it. That scene from the trailer where Aguilar jumps off a tower into the city below is absolutely genuine, marking the highest stunt-fall in thirty years.The modern-day setting is less action-orientated, and used more to drive the story and characters. If I had a criticism of the movie, it would be this. The two time periods are so starkly obvious in their use. There's no story to 15th century Spain, and Aguilar and Maria are empty characters with no motivations or personality. They're vessels in which to act out impressive feats and little else. Similarly, the present day has very little action. Almost all of it is squeezed into the end, and the final climax itself is a little anti-climatic. As I said though, this is where the story lives, where the search for the artefact is given stakes, the lines blurred between the two sides, and the mystery of what's actually going on built and developed. As such (and is important to note for Assassin's Creed fans), the movie is mainly set in the present day, and only flitters back to 15th Century Spain every now and then for short bursts of action. Personally I didn't mind this approach at all, but I can understand that die-hard fans might have a problem with the actual Assassin's Creed sequences being so ultimately superfluous.Finally the soundtrack was great as well. I'll admit that I was worried early on when the titles open up to Entrance Song by The Black Angels, which sounded cliché and made me worry that the whole movie would be a cliché-fest, but thankfully this was not the case. The score is most noticeably, particularly in a cinema, driven by percussion, which thunders and booms with such force that I felt my seat vibrating throughout the action sequences. I go to the cinema a lot (evidently), but I've never experienced a soundtrack so heavy in it's use of sub-frequences that you can feel everything shake and vibrate. Thumbs up on the design and mixing of that. The more melodic motifs are also memorable, with a haunting string line that's almost spine-chilling.Assassin's Creed does not deserve the complete slaughter it's getting critically. At least when it came to Batman v Superman and Passengers last year, I could kind of understand why people might not like them, but Assassin's Creed is hurt more by expectation and prejudice. It is a good movie. It's extremely well-made, with gorgeous visuals, tightly choreographed fight scenes, a seat-shaking score, brilliant performances, and an engaging story that stays reasonably true in spirit to the games. It's not perfect, mainly in how obviously split the two time periods are in their function (I would've liked a bit more character and story to be developed in 15th Century Spain), but I thoroughly enjoyed it myself, and I can see me getting it on Blu-Ray and watching it over and over. I give Assassin's Creed an extremely good 8/10 (almost a 9, maybe I'll boost it up with rewatches), and would definitely recommend."

I can see how it didn't do overwhelmingly well because it was dedicated to people who have played the games. However even my girlfriend who i saw it with even loved it. She has never heard of assassin's creed before this movie came out. To me the art style was very creative and the action scenes felt just like the video games. Overall I think they really captured the essence of assassin's creed. Definitely catered toward people who have played the games before though. Which, being a player of the games enjoyed. The reviews seemed way too harsh. Overall thought it was great. And the cast was excellent."
" Truthful to the game series, entertaining for the fans, but a bit difficult for anyone else
",-0.0772,0.9921,2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Truth be told, I consider myself a harsh critic: The originality of the script, the believability of the main characters and their interactions, the quality of the set design, a masterful edit, the overall coherence of the story elements, an engaging musical score etc. etc. should all be very well in place for me to call a particular movie worth watching, worth devoting time to. Otherwise, as many of you may well attest nowadays, there happen to be many films out there who look, sound and feel very much the same... Films, trying to lighten your purse, without offering anything new. More so than ever, since the ambitious profit-mongering of Hollywood has grown many fold, in direct contrast to its creativity.Now, as for this film, well, having played many a Assassin's Creed game, I had my reservations -and serious ones at that- going to this flick. However, at the end of the day, I was pleasantly surprised. For me, an avid fan of the game series, the movie had it all; it masterfully adhered to all the original story elements which were at the time (and still are) very unique compared to all the other video game franchises out there. And for me, a rabid cinema lover, the cinematography, the editing, the acting entertained me more than I could hope for for such a movie, a movie hard to make based on a video game. Apart from some minor details, nothing really bothered me much. It was a smooth ride altogether: An exciting and entertaining rebirth of the source material on the white screen.However, when the movie was over, when I got home, I started thinking: I had enjoyed the movie, yes, but it was also due to the fact that I did know the story elements beforehand, had intimate knowledge of all that is Animus, Abstergo, Templars and Assassins. In the end, the movie was very truthful to those elements, the source material, but consequentially, it was a lot of stuff to digest, much less to be truthful to.I also realized that, for a movie-goer with no prior knowledge of the source material, the movie (which has to cover a lot of ground in a very limited time, with scarce information as is permitted by the time constraints) might have and probably would have looked a bit confusing: Terminology, multiple time-lines, criss-crossing story elements would be hard to grasp, if not attended to with utmost attention and a willingness to understand.All in all, this is not a bad movie, no sir; actually, quite the contrary. However, if you are not a person who can adjust to a mysterious script on the go with an open-mind and a lust for creativeness, if you like your movies fast-food style, lack of knowledge on this particular video game franchise and the source material can be a bit to much to absorb. It is as simple as that.Otherwise, it is almost perfect. Well done to all those who took part in this masterful adaptation. Thank you."
" Everything is permitted...including this film, apparently
",0.0,0.9799,2017-01-10 00:00:00,5,"There are reviews on here that say that if you've played the series, you'll love it. Well I'm here to say that I love the series and have wasted a frankly appalling amount of time searching for that next piece of Eden - and the film is...meh. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be 'bland'. It's not terrible; there are some cool action sequences and the casting is pretty solid, but it just really is not that engaging a story-line, and too many scenes are stretched out too long. Unlike in the games, most time is spent in the modern day rather than the past, and I feel like they try to over-complicate and over-intellectualise the Assassin-Templar struggle when they could be spending more time rampaging through the streets of Madrid.I got kind of annoyed as well with the some of the clichés given the time, effort, and money that Fox and Ubisoft would have had to throw at what is basically a giant marketing campaign. Jeremy Irons as the bad guy; a female scientist who's only there because she's the daughter of some more important male scientist (and with a really bizarre faux-British accent); the hero ripping his shirt off and flexing his muscles. It really takes no risks and is actually behind the game series now in terms of representation for women and minorities (it scrapes through the Bechdel test right at the very end but I'd expect more at this point.)As I say, it's not awful, and there are some nice bits of fan service for lovers of the games like myself, but it just seems like another example of a video game not translating very well to screen. Don't get me wrong; I'm sure it can be done, and will be in time - this is just not it."

It really feels like the audience are thrown into an assassins creed game and I feel the people behind this movie have delivered exactly what true assassin's creed fans were after. They stuck to the main features of the games and followed it's already successful beginning middle and end with their own small tweaks to still make it feel fresh."

" Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed would make a much better TV series
",0.4404,-0.9196,2017-01-10 00:00:00,5,"I played first three games in the Assassin's Creed series and then stopped, because the series became an obvious yearly cash grab. I hoped that movie, however, will bring me up to speed with what was going on in the nonetheless quite exciting sci-fi universe of the title. Unfortunately, this is not what Assassin's Creed (2016) is about. From the very first scene I noticed that Assassin's creed jumps from event to event without caring to explain or give us any background information. Movie opens with gathering of assassins in Spain who initiate a new member into their ranks. How did he find them? Why do they say ""nothing is true, everything is permitted? Why do they cut recruit's finger off? Since I played the game, I could try and answer these questions, though the connection between assassins in different countries and eras remained unclear to me anyway. Further on, we see the regional office of Abstergo in Madrid with a lot of people who all behave very strangely, but not in an entertaining way. Even the protagonist reacts to the whole situation by saying: ""What the f*ck is going on here?"", and that was my thought as well. It might have been fun if it all started to make sense in the end. Well, it didn't. Overall I felt some kind of alienation toward the characters. Neither of them got enough screen time and dialogues to reveal their depth. It's even hard to say who are the bad guys here. Is the woman assassin romantically involved with the protagonist? What is Christopher Columbus relationship with the Creed? We don't know. Basically, every time someone shows up, he either fades away quickly or starts running, fighting, etc. I enjoy sword fights and I enjoy fighting like in Chinese action movies, but even this part in Assassin's creed felt off as well. I tried to count, and every hit or throw is shown for no more than 1 second, then camera quickly changes direction and it is very, very hard to follow the action. I just came to acknowledge that there is, in fact, some fighting going on, but I gave up on trying to process it, which is a shame. I think it really should have been a little bit slower-paced, with more thorough acrobatics concentrating on quality of stunts rather than on sheer number of them per second of screen time. Having said all that, it should come as no surprise that plot didn't live up to my expectations. On a personal note, I was disappointed that the movie didn't share a lot with the games (at least to my knowledge) except for the Apple, assassin blade and the Templar-Assassin conflict. Even the Animus looks vastly different. Plot itself is rather simplistic, doesn't give a lot of details and, worst of all, doesn't even try to be complete. The ending is a shameless cliffhanger, despite the fact that I actually felt relieved after the movie had ended. Apparently, Ubisoft wants to launch a new Assassin milk cow in the realm of cinematography in addition to the game series instead of trying to create a classic blockbuster. I am not sure if they will be able to lure me into the cinema to watch their seemingly imminent second title. To sum up:Plot: 2/10Soundtrack: 5/10 Affinity with the game: 4/10Visuals: 7/10Verdict: a movie that looks more like a TV series pilot episode, putting action and CGI before plot completeness and character development."
" AC fan or not, this was a great action flick
",-0.2486,0.9972,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"I'm admittedly not a huge gamer, but watched Assassin's Creed just because it seemed to be the best option out of the available selection, and I wanted to use my free movie tickets I got for Christmas over the holiday break. I went into the movie with no backstory, knowing nothing and had zero expectations. I had heard that the movie doesn't do the games justice, but again, this had no bearing on my judgment as I knew nothing about the games to begin with.Assassin's Creed, evaluated on its own, is a great action feature. The action is intense, will keep you at the edge of your seat. CGI is well done. Props, setting, cinematography - all excellent. The plot was easy and straightforward to understand, considering that I'm sure in the video games it is much more complex. Again, as someone who's never played the games before, I feel like I understood everything and the concepts were relatively easy to grasp. Fight scenes were excellent. Chase scenes were anxiety inducing but excellent. Overall, really good. I had zero expectations, and walked out quite impressed. If you're looking for a good action movie in general, I'd recommend this movie. Even if you are a huge AC fan, I think it's also worth checking out to compare with the games, and to enjoy just as a movie overall."
" This fantasy adventure is far too plodding and incompetent to justice for it's popular source material
",0.6597,0.8289,2017-01-09 00:00:00,3,"In a long of Hollywood's poor attempts to adapt video games into quality cinematic pictures, this fantasy adventure based on the popular video game franchise of the same name was expected to be game changer in the category of films inspired by video game. With two-time Academy Award winner Michael Fassbender placed in the lead role and Academy Award winner Marion Cotillard in the supporting role, it is understandably why this film would rise above the typical low bar video game-inspired cinema has set over the past two decades; even if it never scored as a classic hit. Unfortunately, director Justin Kurzel's efforts on adapting the 'Assassin's Creed' series into a quality cinematic piece come to feeble results. What the final outcome is a plodding, ineptly written adventure that not only traps it's stellar cast in a clumsy action extravaganza but falls short of the video games' popular appeal (and this is coming from someone who's actually played the games). This film stars Michael Fassbender as Callum Lynch, a man convicted of capital murder sentenced to death with lethal injection. Upon his death, he is mysteriously transported into a technology corporation known as Absterigo. There, Callum receives the help of scientist Dr. Sophia Rikkin (played by Marion Cotillard) to undergo a revolutionary experiment known as Animus, a virtual reality that allows him to realize with life of his ancestor Aguilar De Nerha in 1492 Andaluisa, Spain. In this historical world, he must fight against a league of Templars to foil their devious plans contributed by Absterigo's CEO Alan Rikkin (played by Jeremy Irons).There is no doubt that this video game-inspired had some potential. But it comes to show that even director Justin Kurzel (who directed last year's 'Macbeth') along with some of Hollywood's most acclaimed actors can't save this film from being the drivel it is. This movie takes the setting of the lead character interacting the company of Absterigo (which serves only as the framework for the story's in the games and expands upon it while cutting down on the historical elements that games that most known for. In the process, it bogs down a ineptly executed plot that barely makes a lick of sense even for those who have played the games. Early on, the lead character Callum Lynch dies with lethal injection and somehow transported into the secret facility (Absterigo) which the film does a poor job of explaining. Later on, his goal is to travel back in time to 1492 Europe to obtain a secret orb that is supposed to cleanse the human race of violence. But it's not long before the film tosses in a number of ill-conceived and fans of the games, unfamiliar story elements that render the plot vastly incoherent. And as the story rolls along, it gets pretty boring.Arguably the most exciting aspect of the film falls in the action set pieces which should have been a lot of fun. Sadly, they fall victim to shoddy editing that criminally drains away most of the excitement. As most of these sequences are set the historical world of 15th century Spain which takes place inside the virtual reality of Callum Lynch, the main Assassin Aguilar De Nerha is being controlled by the lead character who is hooked up to various robotic machines that allow him to control his historical counterpart. The film has the chance to flourish vast excitement by setting the action sequences with Aguilar De Nerha in Spain but instead feels the need cut back and forth from Callum performing the movements on the machines to the action occurring in the historical world. As a result, it flushes away the majority of the tension of these adrenaline-fueled scenes. Michael Fassbender who's easily the most charismatic actor here in the mix at least receives this time to shine in the lead role. In the end, he is the only one that manages to stand out. Marion Cortillard is given almost nothing to do other than constantly gab at the lead character from the sidelines. Jeremy Irons does a fine job but his underdeveloped character treats him with little to work with. The same thing can be expressed by Brendan Gleeson as Callum's father who's serves as nothing more than a plot device.Assassin's Creed is a plodding, incompetently made fantasy adventure that fails to justice for it's popular source material, even for hardcore gaming fans. The film is a messy showcase that not only marks a low point for Oscar-nominated Michael Fassbender but also becomes nothing more than another addition to the pile of poorly made video game-inspired features. One day, Hollywood will have finally came up with a quality adaptation of a popular video game franchise but Assassin's Creed not the one."
" Assassin's Creed: The Best Video Game movie
",0.6369,0.9755,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Assassin's Creed is by far the best movie based off a video game. The action was amazing and thrilling. The setting of the story was a perfect fit for the AC series. The Assassin's they choose to use is one of my favorites. He fits perfectly with the other Assassin's in the series. The critics are way to hard on this movie. Gamer's VS Critics. movies deserves at least a 7 and up. The critics don's understand what a good movie is and the potential it could have in the future. The one thing I did not like about the movie was that they should spend more time in the Animus. Other than that, the movies is a great action and story movie."
" Great movie that needs more exciting and Interesting dialogue with depth, more screen view into the past.
",0.8899,0.9975,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"This review contains spoilers so please look away if you don't want me to spoil it for you. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie it gets a solid 8/10. Now the reason I loved this movie, it was accurate according to the games and I love the games. However, the dialogue at times in this movie needs to be worked on, they have a production budget of $125million, at the moment doing $148million, not bad as they have surpassed the production budget, now if there is to be a sequel, please please please, work on the dialogue. Some lines were pointless, such as when Calum was inside his room and Sophie asks him if he is hungry, he was angry and was choking her then goes to still talking to her whilst having his hand on her throat, should of removed his hand as the moment had passed. Calum repeats lines such as "" yeah I'm hungry"" twice in the same scene and it really shows for a sloppy attempt at making the audience laugh, other than that the dialogue was at least 6/10. Another criticism I would make is the film keeps on switching between past and Present, I don't want to know what he is doing in the animus, I want more screen time on the past, I can understand why they did it to show he was synchronizing with the animus but I'm sure they will improve on this and make the scenes that Calum is in the past longer.On the much brighter side, it's definitely a must watch because it has an amazing story line, the stunts are amazing and action packed, I love how they switch between languages in the movie, it includes the apple of Eden, the hidden blades, the leap of faith and abstergo, the parkour,the assassins against the Templar's. As a hardcore fan of the game I wanted it to be representative of the franchise and this movie definitely does that. The visuals in this movie were just out of this world, I loved how the movie incorporates the eagle and how the assassins are connected to the ""spirit of the eagle"" if so to speak. I would encourage everyone to go watch this movie simply because it's the story line and accuracy it has to the games, if your a hardcore fan go and watch this, if you are a normal viewer who has no idea this movie may jog your mind a lot please do some research into the stories to not get disappointed."
" Seriously why are some complaining?
",-0.3612,0.8157,2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"For those who take upon the quest of taking family or friends to watch movies based on a video game... you will know how frustrating it can be for them and yourself -specially if know you know the story line of the game. This one isn't like that. Why? Because you can actually take someone who has never played the games, read about them or has any idea of it and will still enjoy it. I went this weekend with 4 of my friends, only 1 of them had played one of the games before and we all were excited about the action, the setting, the performance and as native Spanish speakers could forgive the light mispronunciation of some words by the cast members. Why? Cause it didn't matter they did try to speak a language which isn't their own. Now for the movie itself, no spoilers, I'll just say it is enjoyable; based on the game but not a retelling of the stories on it and with no character which are included in the games. So, while you follow the same basic initiative as in the games, there's something new for you. And for the complains about not capturing the ""heart"" of the game... come on, how do you expect a 40+ game play story to be capture in just a couple of hours?

" Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
",0.0,0.9992,2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"When it comes down to film adaptations of popular video games, most have failed or have done little to grasp it's source material and make what we play in the game believable on film. With Assassin's Creed however, it's not a masterpiece but does manage to come so close to being a great adaptation we are needing, thanks to its Australian director, cast, writers and Ubisoft's involvement in the production (they have given the games a break to focus on this film, ensuring that it is better and yet refreshing for fans).Let's get to what made it so good; firstly it stuck close to character and plot much like the games themselves. The writers of the film have managed to compose a story where there's no need of non stop action, cheesy humour and jumbled mess, here they make a story that is really interesting, well paced and make its characters play their part to the story well. Having played very little of the games myself, I took my younger brother along to watch the film with us as he's more aware of the games arc storyline and connections. When it was finished, I asked him about the references and connections to the game source and he said that it does carry a strong amount of connections and nods to the series overall. He did like as well that the story was taken more serious and loved the end results.What I had loved about this film was it's cast performances, eye on detail and plot. Michael Fassbender (who also produced the film and was an uncredited editor credit as well) gives his best as always, making his dual lead characters convincing and strong. From being a man that is fearless and dangerous, to then being one that is discovering his roots, Fassbender proves he can play both characters well. Acclaimed actress Marion Cotillard gives us a female lead that is neither good or bad, but does make her character serve well to the plot, Jeremy Irons also does the same playing her father figure but overall the cast pulls it off greatly.If you are thinking it lacks action, do not fear as it does feature some impressive set pieces that seem so real despite the CGI imagery. The chase/escape sequence that occurs in the middle act of AC being the best in choreography, direction and pace, you will indeed see some of the movements you witness from the game but no spoilers will be made in this review.The visual effects are great despite critics saying it is too heavily utilised, there are built sets and on location set pieces that are beautiful and amazing so it must have had a fairly big budget to work on. The music score is great as well, capturing the tones and similarities with the games themselves.To wrap this up, Assassin's Creed is a pure game to film adaptation that does achieve results for once though I can't get why professional critics hated this film when there is much on offer, but then again this was made for the fans of the games and those looking for pure escapism with smarts and style. It's hard to say if a sequel or even a film franchise will happen for AC, but I'm all in for it but it's up to the box office returns and it gets the approval from Fox and Ubisoft to continue.4/5 - The Autistic Reviewers.

",0.4951,0.4965,2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Well, it's not a total bore-fest. The director of last year's impressive 'Macbeth', Michael Fassbender, Jeremy Irons, Marion Cotillard, Brendan Gleeson and Michael Kenneth Williams. All these big names make you wonder how they messed this up so badly. There's a good premise in there somewhere, but they inexplicably highlight all the worst aspects of the game; namely the scenes set in the future, instead of focusing on the more interesting of the past time-line. The heavily (and poorly) CGI'ed action feels inconsequential and is poorly shot, and just when you think the film is getting interesting, they jarringly break it up with scenes from the future. Avoid."
" Good enough for weekend's dose of action
",0.4404,0.9954,2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Let me start by saying that I have never played the game. But I have some idea on what the game is about and have watched its trailers and videos on YouTube. It is not an easy task to adapt one of the most successful game in the recent history to a cinema. Specially when it's a game like Assassin's Creed where the game itself has a story stronger than most of the movies. Following Assassin's Creed success it was eventual that it would be adapted into a movie and director Justin Kurzel somehow manages this mammoth task just about.Assassin's Creed is completely a character dependent film. It is the story of Callum Lynch whose bloodline belongs to the 15th century Assassin Aguilar de Nerha. He is put into an experiment where his memories are simulated in the real world to find the 'apple of Eden' by an organization lead by Abstergo Foundation. The film shifts between past and the present more often than you like while the search for the 'Apple of Eden' continues and more truths are revealed as it progresses. However it is quite easy to make out that the organization is exploiting Callum Lynch and other people at the facility. The action is primarily set in the 15th century which is definitely the highlight of the film. The visuals and camera-work are top notch. However the same cannot be said about screenplay and characterization. The film however manages to keep us entertaining thanks to good background score and performances.Michael Fassbender might just seem a odd choice to be playing the role, but he has done quite well. Marion Cotillard plays the role of Sofia the doctor who oversees Callum's experiment. There seems to be more to her role than it meets the eye but it is too soon to figure out. Jeremy Irons is wasted in a stereotypical role. However Brendon Gleeson in a short cameo makes a very good impact. Ariane Labed as the 15th century Assassin Maria is pleasing to watch.It is very tough to judge Assassin's creed as a single movie. If there are more to come hope they make up for the loopholes in this film. However this is an entertaining watch for action flick lovers."

The movie portrays exactly how AC looks in the games and instantly looks familiar.I was deeply impressed by Maria, that character is amazing and just because of her I am going to watch this movie again.

Nice action pack movie but when it comes to the smoothness and sense, these kinda movies back step a little. I know I am not talking about movies like godfather or Cloud atlas, but these kinda movies have a target of the larger audience. I think with a target like that movie maker come under pressure and lose important aspects of storytelling.Kids will love this movie but having a more dark theme they might yawn at some scenes.when I was in school I always wanted to see God of war in a movie, but trust me now I don't want that. Game experience is totally different. This movie might get a success at the box office but it will not be registered in the list of great movies ever. I went to watch this movie because I wanted to.

It's a fun watch and you should check it out.The performances in this film are mostly pretty good and there really isn't any bad acting. I do wish they spent more time in the past. I just wasn't as intrigued in what was happening in the modern day. I wished they balanced it out a bit more. A very miner spoiler here but the action scenes also could have been handled much better and improved by not always cutting back into the past and present. If your a fan of the video games you will most definitely enjoy this but if you haven't really played any of the games you wont enjoy this as much. Either way you should give it a watch. It is probably the best film adaptation of a video game this year. Would recommend.

It was lovely to see some of the epic situations you had in game become reality on screen but if it wasn't for the game I would have felt completely let down, the sequel has to be better and I will look forward to it as there is so much potential. The movie will make money due to its franchise but does not deserve to be a blockbuster on the back of the game as it is not the quality that you get from the game"
" Din't expect to enjoy it this much.
",-0.3875,0.9765,2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"I just got back from the cinema and i felt compelled to write my review for this extremely entertaining film, just because critics unfairly smashed this with an 6/10 rating. I was going to go and see this movie anyway since i have played all Assassins Creed games, but i also wanted to prevent a huge disappointment, so luckily my girlfriend convinced me to go, after i showed her the Assassins Creed I game story on YouTube.About the film, the cast and acting are no less than great, the play just flows naturally and logically, the special effects are amazing, and the fighting and chasing around kept me tense. Even if you don't understand the plot the first time, this is a great ride and must see movie, unfairly underrated and gets 10/10 from me for this reason."
" it can be better
",0.4404,-0.8754,2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"500 years ago, a group of ""Assassins"", those game characters wearing the iconic hoods and hidden assassination tools, were appointed to steal back an ancient artifact called the ""Apple of Eden"", an ancient artifact that is believed to be the source that caused mankind's disobedience and free will against God Almighty... or at least in theory. This mission, as the plot expands, was essential because the Christian group, the ""Templars"", were in the process of destroying Al-Andalus... basically anything Muslim or ""heretic"", and kidnapping Sultan Muhammad's son to force his father to give up the Apple of Eden. Thus, it was revealed that Sultan Muhammad hired the Assassins from the start, foreseeing this scenario. Probably, the only problem I had with the movie's story is the ending. After the assassination, we get to see the new assassins on a roof top at a long distance from the Templars' venue, then Callum deciding to fall off a roof.You can see all review from http://www.haberligunler.com/ Then, the movie ends, with little to no hints of a new movie; not even a cliffhanger. eh, maybe it can be better!"
" disappointing indeed. But some potential?
",-0.2732,0.8944,2017-01-08 00:00:00,3,"Assassin's Creed proves once again that we may just never have a good video game movie. Personally as one who has never played an Assassin's Creed game but understand the overall plot of the games I feel that the film does very poorly in its storytelling. Simply put: 'Assassin's Creed' is not a narrative, there is no beginning, middle and end, but rather just amalgamations of scenes where nothing is explained, no characters are developed and the film seemed to be under the assumption that everyone already knows the who's whos and the what's whats. First of all the creative choice for the 'Animus', the fact that Callum is attached to this giant mechanical arm makes various scenes very confusing. The questions that it brings up are infinite, 'What happens when he runs in a straight line or rides a horse?"", ""Where did that spear, sword. Come from, did they just throw stuff at him?."" So essentially Assassin's Creed is just a mess with many unexplained plot points.As far as my understandings of the games goes I believe that Callum's father is supposed to be of significance however when watching this film you can't really see that, their relationship never is established and their interactions seemed very odd resulting in ever weirder decisions being made. Finally one of the most important yet unexplained thing in the movie, 'the apple'. Seriously what does this thing even do? Why do people want it? There just never seemed to have been any clear explanation as to what it is supposed to accomplish or of its function. In the end when the apple starts to glow, what on Earth does that mean???So overall this was just a pretty strange film to watch and the thing is it has such potential, not only because it has great source material and a good cast but because it proves that it does have what it takes in its various scenes that takes place in the Animus, when we saw through Aguilar's eyes those scenes were done really good. The scenery, the action sequences were all great, but somehow the film chooses to only spend about 15-20 mins of the film actually in the Animus which is just mind boggling to me. Especially because before really reading up on the game I didn't even realize that the games also took place in modern times and I think many other audiences unfamiliar with the games would think the same too. Why sacrifice all of these cool assassins action for some weird modern day corporate drama, I really don't understand the creative choices behind this film, this really is quite disappointing."
" Unused Potential
",0.0,0.5766,2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"this movie has a lot of potential in it. However, the director didn't used it in full. as a gamer of the series, the parts you wanna play most are in the past. All the parts outside the Animus, are BORING as hell. Sure, it shows you the bigger picture but it's still way lesser fun than the Animus itself. what's a real shame is that the parts of the Animus in the movie are amazing but there isn't enough of them. most of the movie is for a neutral audience which doesn't know the story. it's understandable, but it kills the fun of the movie for most of it. I would give the movie another half an hour at least to show more Animus, and to give Aguilar more screen time."

" A movie for movie lovers
",0.5267,0.8419,2017-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I never judge a movie by its book nor in this case by the game. Its impossible to create a movie exactly as it is written or played. A movie is in itself a story told in its own way.I go to the movies for enjoyment, for escapism, and to be entertained I do not go to analyse the disparities of a film on a book I might have read or a game that I played.Assassins Creed is a very good movie one that I would recommend to family and friends. 115 minutes disappeared in a flash with a film full of action and stunning visuals. My daughter and I both thoroughly enjoyed this movie.I no longer read critics film reviews as they have lost the plot when it comes to just sitting back and rating a movie for enjoyment. Forget what you read from those people who are paid to sit and try and nit pick their way through a movie. Assassins Creed ticked all our boxes, I rarely see a film twice but this movie would be one of those where I would shell out for another ticket."
" A movie is of course for everyone, but this one has a special audience...!
",0.5916,0.9904,2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Wow, there has been some time since I wrote any kind of review and there have been incredible movies for me to do so, but this one makes me come back and here's why: My opinion has never been so far of the overall critic.(may contain minor spoilers)Many has been said already regarding this ""Gamers Vs Critics"" thing, first of all I'm a huge, huge fan of the Assassin's Creed saga and I've been playing since the first game until the last one (waiting for the next ones as well!), so I consider myself in a position of a harsh critic since they are making a movie of the game I've been playing for the past 10 years!When it comes to reviews, of course there is going to be discordance and as a movie lover I've given several ratings that differ from the ""Critics"" and from the other common reviewers as myself, but in this particular movie my rating is farther from the critics than in any other movie I've ever rated.And then it hit me, critics will never like a movie that is based on a video game as you can go see by yourself (Hitman, Warcraft, Prince of Persia...) You know why? Because the stories are just too big and too complex to make it in a 2 hour movie for all audiences.So I can't speak for those other movies, but this one was made for the AC video game fans!!Don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to watch this movie, but the ones loving it are the fans! I've been reading the critics, and so far the most common one is that is too confusing, doesn't make sense and doesn't develop character, and then they ask concrete questions regarding the Apple and the eagle flying around the towers and the View Points and so on, well guess what, all Assassin's Creed fans (or at least most of us) know what it does mean, all the background stories, all the references, because we played the games!I think it's legit all those questions above from the folks who didn't play the game, and they have the right to give the low ratings for that, but if you are an Assassin's Creed fanatic, believe me this movie is definitely worth the money.All of the action, all of the references, including the ""messing with real history"" that we are used to in the game (yeah Chris Colombus!), the great cast, the stunts, everything was phenomenal. The story, even tho it was not based in any previous characters was compelling, kind of an homage to the AC world, and at the same time not messing with it. They were faithful to all the Assassin's Creed world, they didn't change any major characteristics to put the video game in a movie, they just transported it, and it felt so natural!I give a 9, not a 10, only because of some bits where you can see clearly the CGI on the stunts, and that tiny desire to see more of Aguilar on that Inquisition period. But I do understand that in order for the story to make any sense, the future bits are required to be longer than the ones where you see Aguilar.Please AC fans out there, the critics are probably templars (:P), buy a ticket, it is just fantastic!!"

If you like action scenes just for the sake of action scenes then this film is for you. The negative: The story line is hopeless, The script is awful You can never get attached to the characters, mostly because neither cause is good, from a logical perspective both the goodies and baddies are uninteresting, one has serious logical flaws and the other is based on a real religious order but is searching to 'cure' the world of free will, a very un-Christian perspective. So you have the choice between A: a system that says everything is permitted, there is no truth but we must fight for good (if there is no truth then there is no objective truth). B: world domination through the destruction of free will. Not a very Christian doctrine, so power for power's sake.I came out thinking I had wasted two hours of my time."
" Not the Worst but Far from the Best!
",0.8496,0.639,2017-01-07 00:00:00,4,"Given the disgraceful nature of other infamous game titles that have been adapted for the big screen, Assassin's Creed manages to fare pretty well. When you compare it to say, Prince of Persia, it is actually a semi-successful attempt. That being said, it really isn't a good film outwith such comparisons. I feel like the film was always at a disadvantage: even if you take the story from the games up until AC3, you have at least 30 hours of story line. How could a 2 hour long film possibly do the series any justice within such a small amount of time? Even if you repeated the story line from the first game it would still be longer than 2 hours (a route I feel would have led us to a much better film and actually have managed to stay within the preset universe). I feel that what really let the film down is it's lack of commitment. It's like they couldn't decide whether to make it appeal to non-game players or to make it for the fans. Ultimately this led to a hybrid of the two which leaves the viewers in the position where playing the games puts you at an advantage because you understand what Abstergo is, the history of the Templars, what the Assassins are fighting for, the pieces of Eden, etc. The film briefly touches on these topics but ultimately falls short on any real explanation. However, it also puts you at a disadvantage for knowing this very same information as the film goes against plots from the games. I'm ignoring the obvious difference in the animus and its capabilities because I feel like such changes were necessary for the film. My biggest issue is without a doubt the apple of Eden. I was desperately hoping we would see one of the characters use to properly. This does of course ignore the fact that within the game story line one apple is destroyed and the other is in the possession of the Assassins (I believe). I therefore feel like the film really should have selected a completely new (or briefly mentioned) piece of Eden in order to avoid such contradictions. In the end, I found this film entertaining to watch but as a fan of the series I definitely feel let down. The worrying thing is that the ending (which in itself was completely moronic and went against the core beliefs that had been set up for each character throughout the film) leaves it open for a sequel. Unless they pull their finger out, I hope they leave the AC film franchise as a one off. I mean isn't killing the game series enough?"

It's overexplained and never begins to make sense when you think about it for a little bit. That's alright for the VG's, but this plays it far too straight. We're given almost no levity. Attempts at it fall flat. This idea was never going to work well on film. It's an engine for the fun, addictive gameplay, which this has about half an hour of. The rest of it is trying to explain the absurd concept, while barely getting anywhere in the overall plot. This does score some points. The action is fast-paced, tight, choreographed(occasionally excessively), and in the 1492 sequences, nearly constant. It's broken up only when they awkwardly jump between it and the present. Losing his grip on reality also works. The father/daughter relationship is engaging.There is a lot of relatively strong, bloodless violence in this.

" Childish and exaggerated, yet has it's moments
",-0.3818,0.9912,2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"I like Assassin's Creed, I played most of the games, I know the characters, heck, I am the only person I know that actually reads all the historical information they stick in the games! The Assassin's Creed franchise is a very underrated effort. That said, I didn't expect much of this film to start with, but I still feel it was a waste of talent.The problem, I reckon, is that they had this ambitious idea to reconstruct Spain and at the same time, simplify the whole thing to appeal to those people who never played the game. I am sorry to say that they really failed.Part of the problem is that they missed the point of the stories. I play Assassin's Creed because it is a historical drama, not because it is a science fiction story. I care more about the characters in the memories and how they participated in important events, I care to see how the world could have looked like many centuries ago. Then this film has less than half an hour of Spanish Inquisition time. The reconstruction of medieval Spain is brilliant, is beautiful and full of promise, but we never get to really see it.Hell, the games have more character development than this. I know well enough who Altaïr is and what he does and believes in, but I have no idea who Aguilar is. Fine, he is an assassin, he is in love. And.. what else? The game has a present-day character too, called Desmond. Desmond is boring, nobody really cares because the story is not about Desmond, the same way this film should not be about Cal Lynch, but about Aguilar. Perhaps how Aguilar affects Cal, but that's it. They got it backwards.In most of the film we are stuck in a boring present-day laboratory full of improbable issues. They really screwed here, let me try to illustrate: I suppose the director was afraid of repeating the Matrix theme with the animus, so they decided to do that ridiculous alternate version of it. For what? That's pretty unconvincing and exaggerated. The machine holds the main character by his waist? Really?! Nobody sees a problem here? What about giving him the assassins blade to enter the animus? What was that all about? Why does he need it? And why they keep old-time weapons in perfect functioning order all over the laboratory? There is a bloke using ancient gas bombs! What about the ruthlessness of Abstergo? The security officers are conveniently armed only with batons. What about the main character watching his mum talking to him through the animus? What is that? So, I think all those issues are really too exaggerated. As I always say: it is fine that this is a piece of fiction, that things do not exist. But this fictional universe must have rules and must be rational until a certain point. It does not matter how much technology Abstergo has in the story, no man can be tossed in all directions being held by the waist. Sorry, it doesn't work.The whole animus problem is the most distracting. The historical flashbacks are very well done, but they keep going back and forth with scenes of this machine all the time, that's really bad for the story-telling.I don't know if I would like to see another of these. I think they really messed up. The actors are perfect, the Spanish environment was perfect, the whole idea of having dialogues in Spanish was beautiful, the whole execution of the historical events was well done. But the present-day nonsense really compromised the film. I give my 5 stars to the effort, but I hope they do not try to create a sequel, they should reboot this as soon as possible."

Let me start off by saying I have not played the video games but I have seen gameplay of many of the Assassin's Creed Games. Some things that I do like about the film are the action during Fassbender's memories; basically, all the fighting scenes are well made and choreographed. When hearing about the films problems I only agreed with the character development and some of the cutting back and forth between the Artemis and present time. I didn't mind the cutting between it until learning more about the games and how they take place mostly in the past or memories of the person's ancestor. Also going into this film I knew what to expect, meaning i already knew the character and am already attached to him(them). So the Under-Character Development did not bother me as much. I did not love the film because of the pace or feel from certain scenes and characters, but I didn't hate it either. Overall there are a lot of good action scenes in this film and Michael Fassbender is great. I didn't come for the story as much as the action. 6.7/10"

However, this movie did not make me feel as though I needed to have played them in order to understand or enjoy the film.The cinematography was great, and there were some magnificent aerial views of 15th century Spain along with modern day. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard both gave excellent performances, managing to deliver the occasional corny, melodramatic dialogue with poise, and the supporting cast were equally great in their roles. Despite the occasional cheese, this film had some excellent dialogue that were thoughtful and poignant - unexpected in a fantasy action movie! Speaking of action - this was the best part of the movie. Gorgeous choreography, and I loved all the various weaponry and free running.This is by no means an award winning film, but overall it was incredibly enjoyable, and I don't think it quite deserves the negativity critics and fans of the games are giving it."
" Those who have played the game will love it
",0.765,0.9912,2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"WARNING: For those who haven't played a single minute of the franchise, do not waste your, and our, time watching this movie. You will not understand or appreciate it, just like the critics who have probably never played it either.WARNING TWO: This review contains no spoilersI went into the cinema waiting for two things: for this movie to appreciate the material it was taken from, and for it to present it in an adequate way. I was not disappointed from either.The basic plot is that Callum Lynch is taken into custody by a company by the name of Abstergo, and is used by them in order to access his ancestor's memories, so they can find the location of an Apple of Eden. Basically, what every original AC story (before III) was all about. The questions you will pose are if this movie did justice to the game and its fans. I will answer positively. Acting: Not a single flaw. Fassbender, for his age and collection of award winning movies, gets quite comfortably into both Callum and Aquilar's shoes, while clearly differentiating from both. His emotions are, as always, clearly visible and he moves through the movie without any issue. Marion Cotillard is excellent in her role as well, a great representation of the middle ground between Templars and Assassins, although I wish she could have been used more. Jeremy Irons is ideal in his Grand Templar role, portraying a character that many of the game players will recognise. The female Assassin was also amazing in her role and played alongside Fassbender beautifully.Music: I'll just say this. Nothing like the trailers' garbage. It pairs greatly to each scene and drags you further into the movie. A great and highly attraction point to the movie, if you ask me.Action scenes + Animus representation: Ugh. UGH. Flawless again. They actually made the Animus and the Bleeding Effect look amazingly cool. You'll certainly appreciate each past scene and how it connects to Callum learning through it.Story: The typical Assassin's Creed story. Now, this is where things get a bit lower in standard. While the transfer from the games was really good, ultimately, the movie lacked a climax. Also, several characters were not utilised properly, and it could have used more scenes to delve people further into Aguilar's life. You might feel like the movie is missing something, and the above things will probably be it. I have trust in Ubisoft though, that, quite like the first AC game, it'll learn from its mistakes.Overall: A great action film, definitely the best of its genre (video game adaption), but nothing that will earn Oscars. And it doesn't have to. It's a great homage to the franchise, with superb actors and the correct aesthetic. I'd gladly watch it again.As I said: those who haven't played the games will probably not appreciate it. Do not let their limited reviews stop you from watching it if you have played it yourself."

",-0.7184,-0.7486,2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,As many others I played the Assassins Creed games and was looking forward to this film however it is safe to say that I was extremely disappointed. No matter if you have played the games or not this film was awful. First things first the script is poor. If I hadn't played the games I would have struggled to understand many of the references. The script is vague and confusing in parts which led to a man who sat in front of me leaving half way through (I wish I did the same). Although I am a fan of Michael Fassbender the quality of the writing meant he was wasted in this film. When it comes to the special effects the use of CGI was average. The fighting sequences weren't as good as I expected as it wasn't clear what was happening. The overall story was disappointing and the fact that there will be a sequel made it even more disappointing. I hate to compare but the games were good and the film was rubbish. I would not advise wasting time watching this. Please. For your sake.
" Don't miss it
",0.1139,0.9836,2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Everyone who knows the game, will love to watch the movie. Even you don't know it, it is a very cool interpretation of the game. It is maybe the best interpretation of a game I ever saw it, not even Tomb Raiser from 2001 was that good. The movie I felt I'm a part of it, it catches my attention, the flying scenes gave the extra touch. The fantastic places let feel you are really back in time. Amazing. Of course it is about the mission, and the puzzle get till the end together. The whole story transport the actors, actually there where no well known actresses and actors needed. I'll start my console now and play assassins creed.Have fun and enjoy the movie"
" Excellent Movie!!!!!!
",0.7067,0.9686,2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie. The story line was great. I am not a gamer so I was a bit pessimistic watching this movie but from beginning to end I could not stop watching. I disagree with the movie critics give this movie a chance it will greatly amaze you. It was not a cheesy action movie it was quite believable which is very rare. The main actor also gave an outstanding performance the movie was way over my expectations. I'm never going with the critics again. I just have to see it myself to make my own judgment. Go watch the movie especially if you're a mom like me the main actor was hot!!! I only heard of Assassin's Creed from my teenage son knowing it was a video game did not think I would enjoy it but boy was I wrong. I LOVED IT!!!!
" I fell asleep...
",0.0,-0.9334,2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"I never read the comics and I never played the game so I didn't walk into this movie with much anticipation in the first place. The acting was decent but the pace was too slow and the dialogue was too lengthy, making it very dry. I dozed in and out of sleep a couple times. This might've been the result of my own exhaustion, but the movie didn't exactly make me want to fight to stay awake. Also the few fight scenes that I did manage to catch were frankly unimpressive to me, the choreography seemed a little lazy in my opinion. Lastly, the couple of dramatic crane shots of the characters standing on roof tops looking out into the distance were way over the top for me. An attempt at an epic shot ended up being just plain corny. I'm a big fan of Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard so I expected a lot more from this movie, but was sadly disappointed."
" Don't tell me I should have played the games, that not what films are about
",0.34,-0.9582,2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"I feel terrible giving such a low score to this movie. I might get hate for disliking this to such an extent, but I tried. I went in with an open mind, and totally expecting things to go over my head because I haven't played the games, but this was downright disappointing! I was looking forward to this one for the new year. Not a good start.Where did it fail? The plot failed to captivate me. We are forced to feel connected to a protagonist who is cold and has no backstory of his own to speak of. When did he win the Creed's allegiance? Oh I don't know. When did he decide to turn? Oh I don't bloody know. Indeed, as soon as I was done with my drink and the popcorn got cold, I found myself drifting off. And this movie stars Jeremy Irons!The gameplayers may say you need to play the games to understand this one, but that is not what movies are about. They need to stand on themselves and not have a gaming franchise as a backdrop to be successful (to prove my point, I actually love the first 2 Resident Evil movies, so there, Ha!). I do realise I might have been singing a different tune had I actually played the games, but this isn't the case and my vote stands 5 out of 10, sorry."
" I love the movie
",0.6369,0.4348,2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I must say the movie was great, as a big fan of all the games and having played them to death over and over. the movie was set up real good. goo action and good story telling for how much is ofc possible in 1 hour and 30 min. the only thing i had a little problem with is that the movie was also suppose to be a story in side the same universe just another char. but what i found is that they just forgot about what happened in assassins creed one and 2 ( the time between Altair and ezio. or well forget ezio all together since they put in his time-line, if they would have put it 32 years later instead of 1492 it would have gone 100% perfect with the game story-line)but since that's the only thing i can say bad about the movie and that's just a nerd problem i give it 10 stars for sure!!"
" Prepare the enemas
",0.0,-0.9858,2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"I'll begin by saying that I love watching bad movies. From low budget stuff like Samurai Cop to big studio films like the recent, ill advised, ""destined to bomb"" Ben Hur. There's this evil, sadistic joy in watching a film in which surely a lot of people put effort and care... and than it's awful or unintentionally exhilarating. But than there's this kind of bad movie: the boring one. And,oh boy, is this ""thing"" tedious! On top of that its plot must be the zenith of both goofiness and incomprehensibility.Warning: mild spoilers from now on.Here's the plot (or at least what I think was the plot): There's some kind of secret cult named the Assassin's Brotherhood that for centuries have opposed the Templar Order. These two groups are fighting because of a magic stone that they call ""The Apple of Eden"" created by an ancient civilization, which contains the genetic code for free will (yeah, it's that stupid). The Templars want to locate this stone in order to put an end to the disease that is violence and subjugate the human race (huh... how?). The Templars' head scientist, Dr. Sophia Rikkin, saves an inmate named Callum from the death penalty faking his execution. She reveals that he is a descendant of a member of the Assassin's Brotherhood (who looks just like him!) and conscripts him to the Animus Project, in which Callum is connected to a Matrix-like machine that allows him to relive his ancestor genetic memories (yeah, it's that stupid) so that they can learn the current whereabouts of the Apple.Aaaaand then I checked out. Life is too short. You see: I always watch movies from start to finish (even when they are irritating like Jurassic World or ridiculous like ""Lucy"" or ""Tron Legacy"") but this one was the first that made me think: ""I'm wasting my time"". And I know that you're thinking ""Well... it probably isn't that bad... After all I just want to see some action, explosions, funny jokes..."". No. This movie has the most unbearable, pompous and just joyless tone. Every actor is sleepwalking through this mess and the action scenes (which mainly consist in hooded guys jumping from rooftops and poor Michael Fassbender doing karate alone in a little grey room while strapped to a silly contraption) are as exciting as staring at your washing machine. Oh, and there are endless shots of birds flying. I'm sure they had a purpose."

First of all, if you didn't play The video game you won't understand the story. or you will get only a few head lines , but the story is much more deeper than this. in my opinion, if the creators didn't make a new part with full details. and there is another important thing, there is no actor in Hollywood can do this character, I just that you get a professional parkour player. - 2- where is the team work in the movie, where are the counter attack moves, where is the sword work? 3- this movie is a huge disgrace to the assassin's story. there must be new parts that must be stronger."

I thought they could finally make a good video game movie but no what we got what was a movie with a bad script, bad acting and bad direction that dragged on forever. Most of the movie didn't make sense and its a waste of money if your going to see it. Also usually I would care if a movie had historical inaccuracies but this movie just distorted the past. the movie was overall a big waste because there was so much potential for it but its just another bad video game movie that could have been so much more. and overall this movie was just a big mess and I recommend you don't waste fifteen dollars to see this."

" Deeply flawed, undemanding popcorn entertainment.
",0.4215,0.9914,2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"The track record for video game adaptations is, to be generous, underwhelming. Some have been a bit of fun — Doom, Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia — but there has yet to be one that has transcended its source to be a genuinely great action movie. Boasting a top tiered cast with two Oscar winners and a further two Oscar nominees, in conjunction with a dark and edgy tone that screams to be taken seriously, this slice 'em and dice 'em action adventure had the elements necessary to buck the trend. But it doesn't. Preventing this from being anything more than a spot of popcorn entertainment is the confused and clichéd script, with underwritten plot threads (including an oddly anti-climactic finale), eye-rolling character conveniences and unintentionally giggle-worthy dialogue. It's a shame there wasn't more on paper for director Justin Kurzel to work with, as his set-piece prowess is clear. Given the necessary narrative flesh he could've delivered a franchise-starter with smarts as well as swinging swords. Alas the Aussie filmmaker makes the best of what he is given and provides a few entertaining sequences set in the midst of the Spanish Inquisition, an extended parkour-infused action scene exciting the most. Giving it their all, often in thankless roles, the acting group elevates the material where possible. Michael Fassbender is a charismatic anti-hero and Marion Cotillard brings depth to her conflicted scientist, but Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson are under utilised. Deeply flawed at a base level, Assassin's Creed squanders its potential to be more than a B-grade video-game adaptation. The presence of Fassbender and Cotillard however, along with Kurzel's visual acuity, yields a certain level of undemanding enjoyment."

I played it since the first one came out and to this day after 10 years I played Syndicate.Not all the games were great, but this movie stuck to its origin and I couldn't be happier with the way it came out.The acting felt real, the feelings, and I totally could see the characters as assassins doing what they did in the movie. They all stuck to the characters and only had a few weird moments, but all the games did that. Regardless, I have been waiting for this movie release since it was announced, and I was not disappointed. I feel a couple of things were missed but overall, I think it was great. No Complaints from me."
" Urging will to leave the movie theater
",-0.0516,-0.9679,2017-01-05 00:00:00,2,"This movie accomplished what i thought was impossible: left me with a true will of just standing up and leaving the theater, or just fall asleep to stop the torture of watching this. But for my despair, i didn't, i had to experience this atrocious thing just to be sure i wasn't ""getting it wrong"".{This review contains minor spoilers, stop reading if you don't like them}Assassin's Creed has plenty of material, lots of games and a lot of books also. Books that did the right choice in my opinion, leave out the boring and totally disposable ""out-of-the-animus"" sequences, and focused entirely on the past, putting you inside the action, like you were really in that epoque. In the games these sequences are bearable, cause you only have to rush through them and them just go back inside the animus where you really want to be.And then the movie goes and shits all over the place and does like 70% of the running time in the present, outside the animus. And even when you're inside, they put some cheesy ""match"" scenes of the outside world. Yes, in the movie the animus is a giant arm in which the character moves in the air imitating what he's doing inside the machine, it's super corny and they insist in showing ""how cool that is"".OK, i bashed the ""out-of-the-animus"" sequences in every way, but what if you actually somehow like them in the games? Well, you're not any better off, cause the story by itself, pretending there is no games or whatever, is really bad as well. The movie is really slow in developing anything and when you look at it, the movie is almost over and they didn't show you anything, just a lot of ""beatiful"" scenes one after the other, the movie looks like a showreel (a bad one to be honest).And then there's the end, which looks like it's going to get somewhere and then they end it leaving a ""cliffhanger"" and pretending people will really want a second one of this horrendous thing. They won't have my money this time, i can assure that."
" Huge disappointment
",-0.25,-0.8044,2017-01-05 00:00:00,2,"Movie begins with some eagle shot. So cool! (no)Then some dudes are cutting dudes finger off (1492) and it doesn't matter that in Assassin's Creed II Leonardo DiCaprio (heheheheheheh so funny(no)) (1474(unsure)(maybe even sooner))says that hidden blade was modified so Ezio didn't have to cut off his finger, apparently assassins all over the world didn't cooperate because what are they f*cking gay?Then in 1986 there's a little disabled c*nt who cant even ride a bike Why the hell did they included that scene? - No one knows. Then his mom dies(OMG are they trying to develop a character?(no)) Then he runs away Later in 2016 hes being executed (OMG so much tension! what is gonna happen next to a main protagonist of a movie that surely cant die) What a surprise! - He didn't die! Abstergo abducted him because Abstergo Entertainment apparently doesn't work now and they couldn't have just picked a random dude from the street when actual DNA host isn't required.Back to Spain. Evil Templar have kidnapped a Prince (OMG!! SUSPENSE!!!) Back to present. OMG is that Morgan Freeman? no it's just Moussa(Jesus/Baptist/c*nt that don't know anything about but we have to like him because he's assassin)Back to animus. Now dude without a finger and a random girl that we should also care about (because DWaF likes her but not because she is an important character) are scheduled for execution. But wait! Do you think he's gonna die? Hell no - he's the the main character. Thay run away and DWaF and the girl perform a leap of faith. but DWaF hits the ground out of animus and gets a stroke (why?). Anyway their stupid animus can't simulate sh*t so they use holograms and a roboarm to simulate vision and acceleration (sure a needle in his spine can not produce signals like a normal animus) (also did you notice how careless that shoved it up his spine? He could've became disabled and stuff but its much more efficient than a needle that goes into a stationary/fixed neck in normal animus) Also those out-of-animus shots are very bad and were made just to hide bad choreography.So because dude stroked out Sofia (someone to base a sequel on) gets him out of animus. Than there was some needless drama about his mom that we didn't get to know no one cares and his dad. Mainly it was a way to get him into animus (How did they even end up with this (and did they just introduce his mom for this?(because she's just a blank empty character)))Than angry at all the assassins he show Templar where piece of Eden is. but than he becomes nice because WHY NOT. and goes and kills abstergo director WHAT A FINALE OMG MASTERPIECEThan Sofia tells us that there's gonna be a sequel.THE ENDP.S. film was very bad and i'd put 1/10 but Marion Cotillard was pretty good."
" Great addition to the story, not the beginning, nor the end
",0.6249,0.9393,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"I thought this movie was a great addition to the AC story line. With all of the people writing bad reviews on this movie i think people need to remember that this isn't the beginning of the story, nor is it the end. The movie itself takes place within the same time frame as AC2 (at least within the animus) with a glimpse of another major set of events for the AC Brotherhood. Once you accept that, the fact that we're not going to be watching a guy walking around Spain and stabbing everyone in sight, and the fact that there are more than 1 apple (yes I'm looking at you AC2 speculators), then you can see what this adds for the franchise, and be able to sit back and enjoy the sweet action sequences. The only way i thought the movie lacked was that i would've enjoyed a little more time knowing Cal in between his childhood scene and the execution. All-in-all however, a good addition to the story of the brotherhood, 8/10."

Its a one time watch movie. Action scenes are good , visuals are nice and Acting by Lead actors was marvelous.I can't deny that this film can be pretty confusing, especially to a casual film-goer, but if you're a fan of the game I can't see you walking away disappointed overall. There are certainly some things that need fixing, but if Fox takes a leap of faith (ha, see what I did there), this could be quite the franchise."
" Decent film, best Game to film adaption yet, undeserving of hate
",-0.34,0.961,2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"I watched this yesterday and have been thinking about it all today, trying to figure out the intense hatred and very low reviews (17% on rotten tomatoes is DC area of bad) and although I see peoples points, I don't agree they deserve the level of criticism they have received. Story: While it is simple, so were the games, the games just disguised their simplicity by expanding on your character in the animus, so you forgot that in the real world (Abstergo) it was a simple find and fetch mission. But it is a believable story, and the villains motives are understood. Characters: The present day (Abstergo) characters are fairly well fleshed out if a bit 2 dimensional. But at least they stick to simple characters and don't spend far too long introducing each individual and giving each person a long expositional back story like some other *cough* suicide squad *cough* films did. The only main issue I see here is that the historical figures don't get much character development, but hey, who played Assassins Creed for character development, we all just want the jumpy jumpy stabby stabby!Action: This is the area I think gets the most undeserved hate. I thought it was filmed clearly and well, yes there was some shaky cam, but normally interspersed with wide establishing shots so you understood what was happening in the frame. There is some excellent stunt work done, and it shows, you feel the action. The intensity is well held without you losing any threat to the main characters. There were a few amazing parts where it was filmed and executed to a tee. Don't get me wrong, this is no ""The Raid"" when it comes to action, but it is nowhere near ""Taken 3""'s level of choppy unclear action.Summary: An enjoyable film, will not redefine the genre, but it is definitely a far cry from the normal video-game-film-cursed- monstrosity. Watchable by people who have never played the game, and those who have played all of the games! Definitely give it a watch if you like sci-fi free running and caped capers!"
" Solid flick for fans of the games
",0.1531,0.9906,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I tend to set the bar pretty low for movies based on games, that way I can be pleasantly surprised for the ones that don't suck. This one was a lot of fun and paid great tribute to the franchise many of us have grown to love, though it likely would seem a bit lame to non-fans. There are a lot of familiar images that aren't explicitly addressed within the movie and some of the specifics have been creatively adjusted (like the design of the Animus) but if you know the games then you'll find yourself comfortably immersed within the world of Abstergo, Assassins, and Apples of Eden. The only downside, really, is it's yet another white male hero. I like Michael Fassbender as much as anyone and he gave a great performance, but it would have been nice to see a darker-complected protagonist (like Desmond was in the games).TLDR: Decent story line and a good dose of action. If you enjoy the games, check this one out!"

I will say while assassins creed is a nice visual film but it does have some flaws but for those who are die hard fans of the games, it won't faze them match, Michael fassenbender plays callum lynch who witnesses his mother die as child who was actually a Templar and whose father was actually an assassins. Callum also discovers the absergo industries a big part of the game whose goal to eliminate violence actually seems to be a cover for something more sinister which the apple of Eden another aspect of the game plays a vital role here."

But since having viewed it, it makes perfect sense considering media these days. How often is a book made into a movie? Or better still, why is Shakespeare so often read and not seen as was it's purpose. At any rate, I was proved absolutely wrong in my presumptions. I had so much fun and I reveled in the subtle references to the game i.e. jumping into a pile of straw. I also considered that with the state of video games these days it's not a strange idea to make them into movies. They've matured to such a storytelling nature that a movie is not a such a silly notion. Regardless, this film is a lot of fun. I highly recommend giving it a go."
" Why are the critics so unfairly harsh?
",-0.6573,0.9621,2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"This is, by far, the best video game adaptation I have ever seen. I do not understand why the critics have been putting down this movie with such violence... Is it because they want to make the filmmakers pay for the fact that they chose high-caliber talent instead of goofy actors and an 'obvious' choice of director? Is it because the producers decided to go with a indie film director whose vision they believed in? I think the music is amazing (bravo to Justin Kurzel's brother) and the visuals are extraordinary. All the actors did a fantastic job in this movie. This is unlike any video game movie I have ever seen, and will go down in my book as the best adaptation out there today."
" Fan of both Games and Film
",0.3182,0.9926,2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"An excellent adaptation of the games feel and spirit while changing the story to feel fresh and exciting. I would have liked to see more on Cal's backstory because it is very vaguely mentioned and it makes you feel less empathetic towards the ""murderer"" of a main character. The bulk of the film is very well done splitting the Aguilar story with Cal's story and tying it together in the end. Aguilar is a perfect assassin with great action and chase scenes that stay true to the Creed we know and love. They tie together a new story with old favorites that will make you smile and still keep you on the edge of your seat. Definitely worth seeing as a fan of historical fiction or the Assassins Creed Games. Hope there will be a Sequel!"
" Fassbender fans will enjoy it more than gamers.
",0.4939,0.989,2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed the film very much, I love how sutle and un-Hollywood Fassbender is. He's a great story teller through his characters. It's not just all action which I think will upset the gaming community. I'm not a gamer, I'm into movies and I thought this was great storytelling which is exactly what they were trying to achieve with this film. Obviously they need to explain the plot. So people saying this is boring obviously have very short attention spans. I'd say the film is 60% present setting and 40% 15th century Spain, which I enjoyed as I happen to like more dialogue in a movie if it's written well not just all action. I like a good balance and this very much had a fine balance between the two. Good job Michael a great storyline too as well as performance. Something different for sure."
" A good movie but not flawless (don't listen to the critics)
",-0.3824,0.9943,2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"First things first. I'm not a gamer but the Assassins Creed Games are the only games I ever really played. So naturally I was looking forward to this movie an I was not disappointed. Not at all.The movie has undoubtedly stunningly beautiful visuals and a cast that consist of, what I believe to be, some of the best actors we got at the moment. So based on technical, visual and casting aspects of the movie I would give them a straight 10/10.BUT! And sadly there is one. Some might even say a big one.The Story. I don't think that the story is as bad as many critics want you to believe it is. For example. I really liked the characters and the way they are shown to us. ( I'm not a professional I just write it the way i felt it).What you need to know about the Assassins Creed Games is that they have, just like the movie, two story lines. One is in the past as the actual assassin and the other is in the present. In the Games the Story in the Past is the Main Focus and the Present just provides a frame for it. So the Assassin had a Story of its own without the apple of Eden(Yes it interfered with the story line at some point but it wasn't the ""thing"" that was driving our character forward). And many, like me, did not like the Storyline in the present and were always thankful when we could go back into the animus and forget about this ""nonesense"". In the latest editions of the games this Storyline was pushed further and further back. Now its hardly there anymore. What proves my point of me not being the only one who felt that way.Now. The Movie turns this upside down. Here we do have the two Story lines but the focus has changed. The main Story is now the one which takes place in the present. The Storyline in the past or ""in the animus"" has now the supporting role. Its purpose is now to deliver great (and i really mean great) and beautifully shot action sequences. Also to some move the main story in the present forward.So we spent more time in the present with Cal than we do in the Past with Aguilar. That was disappointing at first because the trailer suggested more time with aguilar. He hardly has any Storyline. So that is that. But the more I think about it (the more I get away from my original expectations) the more I liked the movie. They decided to tell that story on with Assassins creed is based on and not just the story of one assassin. And they did a fine Job if you ask me.So if you keep that mind you will enjoy the movie. I did not know that so I had some problems warming up to it.Conclusion 8/10 Two points are missing because of the end. I won't say anything about it because I want to keep this spoiler free. The end is, again, not bad but...you will know when you saw the movie. That combined with gut feeling is a solid 8/10"
" A poor video game movie that had so much potential
",-0.4767,0.9882,2017-01-04 00:00:00,3,"I've got to be honest I was excited to see assassins creed even with the poor reviews but I'm afraid to say that this film is such a waste of potential. The premise of this film sees a deceased convict revived and used in a machine to access memories of his ancestor who is an assassin. Michael fassbender plays callum lynch and Aguilar in this film as he tries his best to get the most of this film. He is a good fit for the role especially when he plays Aguilar in the 1400s, the only problem is I found the character of callum to be very dull and he doesn't get much development as a person in this film so you end up not really caring about him. Also Aguilar doesn't get enough screen time for you to care about his character he is just there for cool action scenes. Maroion cotillard and Jeremy irons are in this film helping callum but there characters are pretty dull and really could have been played by a few different people. They don't really add to this film at all and come across as boring characters. None of the other performances stand out either even when you are clearly meant to care, you just don't. The story is where this film really falters, there is so much source material to go off and this film doesn't utilise it enough. This film is 25% in the 1400s and 75% in present day and the present day really isn't interesting enough. If the film had focused more in the 1400s this film would have been so much better. The script has some decent dramatic dialogue that makes you care more then you really should. However, the humour just doesn't work in this film and comes across as lazy writing mixed with allot of exposition dialogue that ends up bogging the film down. The style has some good action scenes especially in the past scenes with some really cool acrobatics in it and it does stay true to the games in its action scenes. However, there is way too much shaky cam used in this film and it makes some of the scenes incredibly jarring to watch. Also the pacing of this film is all over the place as I mentioned before with the ratio of past to present scenes. Overall this is one of the more disappointing films in recent memory and it isn't worth watching even for big fans of the video games."
" Not what I wanted but way better than critics say
",0.2617,0.593,2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"I went to see the movie with low expectations: video game adaption, bad reviews, and I know too much of the franchise.Turns out I do know the games too well to not notice where it all went wrong. But the reviews don't reflect the movie's quality at all. Most are full of pretentiousness and bias against video game adaptions. Don't get me wrong, there are many fair critiques too, some that I'll address myself, but they are a minority. When you read that the story was too rushed and too slow, you know there's something wrong with them. Confusing end? Only if you have the short attention span of a gold fish.Now my actual review:***Spoilers start***The opening scene was well done, but not well chosen. Whatever happens in Aguilar's story, should happen inside the Animus. That gives us the feeling that we're living the story with Callum. This seems like a minor thing, but it's important to the whole Animus-story.The music was average. Some parts of it were oddly similar to Interstellar. The only really horrible part was right after the Aguilar intro, it didn't suit at all.The present story was well-paced, and well done for a first movie where they have to set up the groundwork, but not special. The side characters weren't given enough depth, the only good characters were Callum and Sofia, with a nice ending to their development. It wasn't great, but good.The past story was thin. They hardly had any Animus time, and when they did, it was mostly action scenes. It was good not to give it too much time for the first movie, but a bit more would've helped. In the games, Altair's story wasn't long either, but it was good, it gave us an idea of what assassins are and their origin.The worst: the Animus. A central point to the story, changing it so drastically shows a lack of faith in the source material. That arm was needless at best. The altar or chair would have be fine. It consumed too much time of the movie, looked very bad (CGI-wise), was cheesy, and I bet it cost a lot more than making an actual prop of the altar/chair.It was executed poorly, constantly switching to the present while in an action scene totally cut the immersion into the past story.Then Sophie said that he can't control anything inside the Animus. That's just plain wrong and takes away any stakes. For whoever hasn't played the games: You DO control the person inside the Animus. And if you fail to replicate the memory, you get desynchronised. You can't travel to Rome in the Animus if the character hasn't been there until then, because there are no memories of Rome, you can't unlock them. You can die, and you get desynchronised. You can do stuff around the world freely, as long as it is withing the boundaries of the memories and you synchronise well. By completing a memory, you unlock the next one. Like when you're looking for your car keys, you remember some moment before, and replicate what you did from then on. Horribly implemented in the movie, the worst part of it, and such an important one.The action scenes in the first half were constantly interrupted by the animation of the Animus, and the camera cuts were awful. But as the last Animus sequence began, they were much more fluent and interesting. While not perfect, and not up to the games' standards, they were nice.The CGI was bad. The only CGI they truly needed outside the Animus was the Apple of Eden, which looked unspectacular. The rest could've been done with props, and it would've looked much better.The costumes and weapons were nice, there's really not much to say here.Atmosphere-wise, at some points I thought they took it too seriously, too ""edgy"". Usually AC has some more light humour, a certain charm and freshness. They tried it in the cafeteria scene, but it wasn't nearly as good as in the games. It also lacked that mystical, scary feeling with the glyphs, and the artefacts and everything.""We work in the dark to serve the light"". Then do it. Assassins kill silently, effectively, and with style, it should be dramatic, not too action-packed. Some action scenes are fine, but put the focus on the silent killing.The way they explained the artefacts: cheesy. ""It's the genetic code for free will."" What? No, no it isn't, stop inventing. You literally have a manual for the apple in the games, use it! This sounds so pseudo-scientific, and sure it's sci-fi, but it sounds somehow believable. But genetic code for free will? Why would you say that?***Spoilers end***The movie as a whole wasn't great in the first half. The second half really saved it. The story became faster, the action scenes better, the characters more interesting. Luckily, otherwise this movie would have been a disaster, and albeit being far from perfect, it's still good. I recommend it, as, despite its immense flaws, it's still really enjoyable, and builds the groundwork to a great continuation. All in all it really showed lack of faith in the source material. The one-dimensional representation of assassins as mere weapon wielders, the cringey explanation of the Apple of Eden, and the Animus. If they had trusted the source material, dug into it, used it correctly, then this movie could have easily been 8.5/10. It's not Assassin's Creed if it doesn't include the main properties of the game. Taking risks is fine, but there's a difference between that and changing fundamental points in the franchise. When are you going to get it, Hollywood? If they trusted more in the source material, that would be great.Overall rating: 7.5/10"

Perhaps the biggest problem with ASSASSIN'S CREED is the Greater Evil versus the Greater Evil conflict that it sets up. In one corner this Fox flick presents the rabid Burn-Her-at-the-Stake Party--the backward, anachronistic Romans unable to do such a simple thing as to purge their ranks of Soul-Killing Child Rapists even Today. Holding down ASSASSIN'S CREED other corner are the title characters themselves, members of a religious Death Cult distinguished by a Millennium-plus of stoning women, burning chicks alive, and drowning them in cages. Besides a ""Holy Book"" calling for medically-unnecessary punitive appendage amputations, these miscreants have recently destroyed all the physical evidence of Early Human Culture throughout our Cradle of Civilization. (If there actually WAS a digital version of Eve's apple--as ASSASSIN'S CREED posits--they surely would have smashed it to bits eons ago!). The bottom line is that ANYONE who has a dog in Fox's fight (or ""Clash of Civilizations"") here probably should be locked up for the good of Humanity!"
" A Spectacular Thill Ride
",0.0,0.9951,2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"""Assassin's Creed"" has the potential and the necessary specs to be one of the best movies of 2016. Yes, it may have some flaws but you can't just look at the flaws and expect the movie to be horrible. I had the opportunity to see this movie a couple weeks ago. I really thought that this movie was amazing on a so many levels. In the movie, it shows you an in depth look at how the some what protagonist/antagonist, Callum Lynch, a stone cold assassin, became how he was and why he is the way he is. The action sequences keep you on the edge of your seats, and although a little bit of them, are at times confusing and hard to follow, you still get the entertainment joy people should get while watching a movie. Now, I bet you guys are asking yourselves, ""How come it got such bad ratings?"" Well, probably because ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" came out at the exact same time this title came out. Basically, it was taking away a great amount of moviegoers because of how bad they wanted to see Rogue One. The cast ensemble was spectacular. A lot of good actors and actresses played in this film, and they played their roles excellently. Michael Fassbender played the role of Callum Lynch, our main character, and played him the best I have seen an actor play an assassin. Kudos to Ubisoft for making a film that could be considered one of the best movie of 2016. Do yourselves a favor and see this title."
" Really enjoyed it!
",0.5974,-0.8993,2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Call me a sucker for hooded figures, but I really enjoyed this movie!I haven't played the games yet, so I didn't have any preconceptions about what the story should contain. I heard it didn't get very positive reviews, though, but I didn't believe a movie starring the actors it does could be THAT bad. And it really isn't. I liked the story, too. It's easy to follow, it keeps you engaged and it's packed with action. The fight scenes are well done, the high jumps and the dives made my heart rush, but then again, I'm a sucker for those, too. The reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because there were several moments where CGI was way too pronounced and I don't like when that happens. I like it when it blends in nicely."
" A moral disaster, a mental terrorist attack at modern, western, humane, moral values
",-0.8807,-0.998,2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"I never played the game and I did not know about the story, I just liked the look, although I was repelled by the name Assassins""- should have been a warning. Not knowing the game, I did not know what to make of many details in the movie, but this was by far not the worst thing. Like in Kill Bill, where you are supposed to root for a hit-man/hit-woman who has bereaved countless people of their beloved ones and then thinks she has the right to punish those who did nothing else to her, this movie wants you to root for a bunch of Arabian killers fighting the catholic church. Fassbender, who always emphasizes his Irish half (as opposed to his German half) plays one of those, it's actually a couple of Irish actors who portray this lowdown murderers fighting the church. I am not a bible-thumper, in fact I left the church, since I am convinced that they believe in the wrong things, and I am fully aware that church people did horrible things a couple of centuries ago but today they are NOT the villains, like the Nazis the sins of the church are long gone, but killing and violence are still true, and committed by other people. And don't tell me about free will. I am all about freedom, but free will is an illusion, God laughs about it, how many people do actually have control over their lives? And what is free will worth if it is used to kill and to decide who is worth living? This is the most ridiculous scene and worst line in the movie when Lynch, the murderer who shortly before was on death row waiting to be executed says that not all life is worth living. What??? This movie is a moral disaster, a mental terrorist attack at modern, humane, western, moral values. And people don't care and don't realize how they are being brainwashed as long as there is enough action and violence in the movie – and in order that this dumb, violent people can keep their free will (and therefore keep executing violence and deciding about what life is worth living without the least capability of responsibility) it is okay to kill people??? I do believe in few things, but I believe firmly that violence is never justified unless you are being attacked with a current high physical threat that you have to fight off and have no others means at hand, and that all life is worth a chance and has to be protected. And where are the people who are bawling and rioting whenever a character is being cast with someone of a different ethnicity (like Tilda Swinton as an Asian) – well, here, a lot of Irish are cast as Arabian killers fighting the church, and no one gives a s-because values only apply when they come in handy, right? The whole world has gone to s including my opinion of M. Fassbender, I once thought he was a great actor, I once was among those thinking he was sexy, but (greatness and) sexiness require(s) a high level of decency and obviously Fassbender has very little of it taking part in such an awfully plotted story. Worst movie ever...so far Don't watch if you have the slightest feeling of decency - you might feel offended."
" Great fights, but forgettable
",0.1779,0.888,2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Assassins Creed, as a game series, is at its core a game about using parkour to get around and kill people. That is what the movie is about too.The plot follows a Michael Fassbender as he finds out a distant relative was an Assassin and has hidden a mythic artifact from the Templars. Using the Animus, a tool that analyzes genetic memory, he relives key moments of his ancestors life. The highlight of this movie is watching the assassins move. Whether they are fighting or running the choreography is spectacular. Everything else supports this. The story and acting are simple and do a great job of leading to more fighting. There are twists in the plot that cause fighting, then over roof escapes. The character development and the ending both seemed sudden. Some of the choices the characters made seemed instant and out of place. Also, the end resolved really fast. These got in the way of the parkour, and took away from the film.This was a fun movie to watch but is not for everyone. If you want a well tied together mystery about a mans ancestors, this is not for you. However, if you want an entertaining series of well choreographed parkour fights, this will not do you wrong."

I can honestly say that it was one of the better movies I have seen this year and I enjoyed it which was surprising to say the least! Don't get me wrong it is not a classic and it does have its faults, but I can easily say I enjoyed this film far more than BvS! I can easily say this is the best game to movie adaptation I have seen and a good action movie on its own which doesn't deserve the critical reviews it's receiving! Honestly I would easily go in to see this movie again and would implore you to go and give it a try cause it might just surprise you as it did me!"

Graphically,it's amazing. Action is great. Casts are great.But the story is just not deep enough to me. Especially if you love Ezio's AC series like me. They did cover some signature things you can do in the game. But there're also things I love to do in the game I wish to see but I didn't see.(You have to see it yourself. No spoilers.) I think it would've been better if they can make it like a HBO TV series in Game of Thrones style and scale. Overall I enjoyed it. It does make me want to play the AC II (my favorite) again. Go see it . Not a bad game adaptation."
" Michael Fassbender will look back on this (when he is a lot older) and whince
",0.0,-0.9781,2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"When Michael Fassbender looks back at his movie catalogue, in his older years, he is going to regret making this movie. It is always a risk making a movie based on a computer game (look at the delays with Gears Of War and some poor Halo movies), as most of the action computer games are aimed at 18 years and old due to the violence. When it comes to movies the studios have to claw back the money so they lower the ratings to a 12a (UK) and it shows very poorly. Now this doesn't mean to say there isn't any violence as there is. So much so that I don't know how this passed the BBFC as a 12a as it is clearly a 15 here with the level of knives, stabbings, neck slicing and spearing that it is not aimed at children. In a generation that struggles with knife crime these kind of movies really need to start either being toned down for a 12a or placed as a 15. I know this won't remove all knife crime but this rubbish movie is desensitising children in the use of knives as well as parents being so naive that they think their children aren't going to be impacted by this (not all but some will be!) So going back to the movie itself, started out good but then nose dived (no spoilers). The interaction was very messy, the plot was stupid and insulted the video game, the acting was wooden, the music script was really muddy and the overall flow of the movie felt disjointed. The SFX were very good, not knocking that at all, but it has really failed to get over the success of the video game. I've already seen the scores on here go down and I expect it to go even further. I watch a lot of movies so I am not a random movie goer that gets super excited when I get some time to go out to watch something so it does take quite a lot to impress me these days. This movie insults those of us that want a good story and that is taking us on a journey of adventure. It lacks any understanding of what dedicated movie goers want and shows Hollywood at it's worst. When you compare it to stand out decent game adapted movies (Resident Evil (1st one)) and Warcraft (not as good as Resident Evil!) then there is no excuse for Assassins Creed! I don't normally agree with critic reviews but on this occasion they have got it right. Really bad!!"
" Another computer game turned into a film of spectacular philosophical-historical speculation
",0.0,-0.5397,2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"It's difficult to squeeze it into some comprehensive definition. It is a kind of futuristic occult science fiction with some historical context added to it, which makes it interesting in spite of all the technical indulgences and endless massacre scenes, where people are so efficiently slaughtered so that you almost never can see who is being killed or why, maybe just for fighting, while half the contents of every fighting scene is devoted to acrobatic escapes impossible to perform even at a circus and over-obviously inspired by the three latest James Bond-movies. The most interesting part is the one about 1492 with inquisition scenes, Columbus and all that, while what also saves the film is the performances of Jeremy Irons, Michael Fassbender who has to work harder than ever for it through a vast number of exasperating scenes of struggling, Brendan Gleeson as the father who for some incomprehensible reason found it necessary to kill his wife and Michael's mother, Charlotte Rampling in a typical debatable role of hers, and Marion Cotillard as Sofia who eventually is the only one who gets away without blood on her hands although she added to it, as the one who you understand least of what she is saying - the problem of absence of intelligible diction, like in some many modern films, is over-evident here. The scenery is also impressing with wonderful panoramic views of Sevilla and London, while the eagle is the one who lifts the film to a truly interesting level of allegorical philosophical speculation leading to cosmic afterthought. You can't remain unimpressed by this film, no matter how absurd and phantasmagorical it is, since there is some interesting historical truth of metaphysical kind hidden in it after all.I would have given it 9, if it had not been over-loaded with violence, although that is the film's very argument, but all the fighting scenes tend to get repetitive."
" Harshly Rated. Bold. Exciting. Intriguing.
",0.7003,0.9933,2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Assassin's creed is the harshest rated movie I have ever seen. The movie is great in so many aspects that I am simply bewildered as to its current scores. Everything from it's production design to cinematography, script writing, story and choreography make this film undeniably good. The performances of Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotilard and Jeremy Irons are great and ground the theatrics of the film (which are great). The integration of the Animus into the story is my favourite story aspect and is an innovative and bold step cinematiclly. Seeing the mechanical arm in the trailer had me a little worried at first but once I saw it work so well with the editing of the Spanish inquisition scenes I knew instantly that it was the right call. Kurzel took ideas from the video game series and expanded upon them respectfully yet boldly at the same time, I believe it payed off.I was in a packed cinema and the acting of Fassbender seemed to win the audience over, they all laughed at stages and I had never seen so many people on the edge of their seats in a chase scene. All in all an overlooked movie by critics but I'm sure will be appreciated by filmmakers like me and fellow film lovers that love innovation and quality."
" Why the hate?

Still I went ahead and watched it as a sci-fi rather than a historical movie. And boy did I enjoy it. The action scenes are just amazing, so is the cinematography esp. for the scenes set in the past. Sure there are few issues here and there, but the movie is far from disappointing. The ending is not that fulfilling but is understandable considering the director wanted to leave few threads open for a sequel. If anyone wants to watch it, please do not be deterred by the exceedingly negative review comments floating around. The movie sure is enjoyable !"
" Great Substitute for the Game
",0.6249,0.2259,2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"I read somewhere that this film is in the running for the worst film of 2017, which must be an effort considering that this is the first film that I have seen so far this year and that I am sure there are going to be plenty more really bad films being lined up. Mind you, it is also a cinematic release, so this doesn't count the really bad films that don't make it to the cinema screens, or at least the screens of the cinemas that tend to only show main stream films. As for me, I would hardly call this a bad film, in fact I quite enjoyed it, but I feel that maybe one needs to have to have a bit on an understanding of the background of this film to understand what is going on.So, Assassins Creed, for those who don't know, is actually based on a series of computer games of the same name. Basically it is about two factions: the Knights Templar and the Assassins, who are in an eternal conflict over the control of the destiny of humanity. Basically the Knight's Templar want to do away with free will as they believe that free will is the cause of all violence, while the Assassins believe that violence is the sacrifice that one must pay for freedom. Anyway, there are a number of artifacts, the Artifacts of Eden if you will, that the Templars and the Assassins are seeking, one to control humanity while the other to prevent the former from getting them.The tricky thing about this film (and the game series) is that it is set in two eras, the modern era and the historical past. The main action occurs in the past, however the Knights Templar have this device called the Animas which allows the genetic descendant to travel back experience life through his ancestor, and the Animus allows them to record what the ancestor sees. The reason for this is the ancestor of the protagonist knows where one of these artifacts is, and the Knights Templar are using the descendant to track the final resting place of the artifact so that they might obtain it.The surprising thing is that Michael Fassenbender starred in this film since I expected him to prefer more complicated roles. Okay, there is always the theory that an actor takes a mainstream role for payment and then an artistic role for their own hobbies, however the problem with that is that the wrong movie could actually kill the actor's career. Mind you, after seeing Fassenbender in some rather more complicated films (and the X-men series don't count), I find it odd that he is taking the lead role in what is in effect a mindless action flick – and a mindless action flick is basically what Assassins Creed is. Okay, there is always this theme of peace verses free will, but it is one of those tired old plot devices that has been around forever.As for the fact that it is based on a computer game does intrigue me, especially since these days I really have little to no time to be able to play all of the computer games that I have wanted to play, and also that they have become so complicated that I would prefer to leave them to the die hard gamers and simply play around with my old school relics. However, the plots of a number of these games to intrigue me, as do assassins, which I why I wanted to see this film. In a way I was never going to play the game (in the same way that I was never going to play World of Warcraft), and the fact that I would only play the game for the plot I do appreciate the appearance in the movie.As for the film, I enjoyed it, but I have to admit that the ending was actually somewhat of an anti-climax. I won't go into too much details as it would be too much of a spoiler, but I felt that the final fight came a little too soon which left the ending a little, well, surprising and a bit too sudden."
" An Embarrassment to the Assassin's Creed Game
",-0.4404,-0.9882,2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"This is truly an embarrassment to the original game. They could have made it in several series and followed the original story in the game, but instead it tried to awfully merge several stories and concept from the game. What ashamed. I was looking forward for some awesome story line. But instead, it was utterly a disappointment.The main character, however, did perfectly well. The special effects to recreate an ancient civilization was also fantastic. But when the movie focused more on the present day people, I lost taste in the movie.The key success of the story should have emphasized more on the mystery of the Apple of Eden since ancient time. What drive the Templars to become so crazy about it? What motivates the Assassin's Creed to prevent the Templars in acquiring it? These questions should have been conveyed in the ancient times and not in the present day. It would have been more meaningful, because ancient people believe in magical things. Present day people despise magical things. So the movie failed to transmit the emotion to audience about the whole struggle of acquiring the Apple of Eden.And if the movie followed the game's story line, there will be an act of betrayal by the Assassin's Creed elders. This would have been a lot more interesting story line. But instead, they deviate it and create a terrible terrible terrible terrible story line. I can't say enough of how terrible it is. The most stupid decision ever made by the story creator.It gets worse when the mystery is finally revealed before the ending scene. This is so horrible. It ruined the entire Assassin's Creed concept. If the story maker has never played the game, then he should have never be given the authority to make a story for this movie.Argh. I just hated when people messed up a movie that should have been incredible. Especially when the game is one of my favorite game of all time."

It's that type of movie. If you can make sense out of the plot, you are a better person than I am. How does DNA project images, feelings,movements,etc. First off, they put him in an Animus...really, you could not come up with a better name than that? Which actually means a governing spirit or basic attitude.I am not understanding the connection. Anyways..moving on...first, Cal is in prison for murder of a pimp which is not explained at all. They do not explain exactly how they got Cal out of the prison once he is executed. He just appears there as though it was an easy task smuggling him pass the medical examiner and out of the prison. Yes maybe I am thinking too much, but it would have made the story more interesting than it was. Also, do the people observing him in this so called Animus see the spirits and hear the sounds that he does? In a couple of movie shoots, it seems apparent. Look/hear close when the Sophia and Cal are in the Animus, there is one scene where the sound is coming through and she reacts. Or are they just looking at this guy make these awesome kung-fu moves in the air looking like a moron. The ""Apple"" seems to him mystic technology as at the end when Rikkin holds it up. It also does not explain how the Apple will annihilate the assassins, disease, instant death,etc. I can go on and on so let's keep it short. This movie sucks, hopefully there is not a #2 as #1 was boring enough. Save your money and wait for the DVD, Redbox,Netflix or other cheaper means."

The user reviews say it all.I have played all the games in the Assassin's Creed series, and extremely enjoyed this movie. It did justice to the games while telling a familiar but new story. The action and stunts were fantastic, and offered plenty visually. I will be the first to admit playing the games does make it easier to understand some of the concepts and ideas in the film, but overall they do enough without treating the audience as idiots. You can go watch LaLa Land if you really want to listen to critics. But I know which movie I'd prefer to see.Look how easy it is to be a critic, its taken me two minutes to write this. Do yourself a favor, don't jump on the bandwagon, see the movie yourself, enjoy it and have your own opinion."

" Surprisingly enjoyable
",0.6249,0.9943,2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"I didn't have any high expectations for this movie, knowing about the mixed reviews it's been receiving, but when the credits started rolling, I actually felt satisfied. To begin with, Michael Fassbender was fantastic as both Callum Lynch and his ancestor Aguilar, and Ariane Labed performed surprisingly good as well. The present day narrative, which the movie mostly existed of, was the best I've seen since ACIII and successfully showed the viewer a new side to the very familiar universe. It was also interesting to see how the main characters Callum (Fassbender) and Sophia (Cotillard) actually questioned their acts and beliefs, rather than mindlessly following their creed or just doing what they have been told to do. But the historic sequences, although few and lacking a profound story, were the most enjoyable of the movie. The stunts and fights were breathtaking and the Spanish inquisition provides a perfect setting. Of course the movie wasn't flawless; there were some badly developed side characters and also a couple of confusing plot points here and there. But the film still managed to keep me entertained throughout most of its run time. Assassin's Creed provided enough enjoyment for me, as a fan of the series, to like it overall, and to conclude that it doesn't deserve the hate it's been receiving from the critics."
" I enjoyed this immensely
",0.5106,0.9789,2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I'm another one that does not take reviews as gospel. Whilst I had formed some opinion based on the bad reviews, the fact I play the games and love them and followed over the game series, I went along unsure what to expect but as I watched and the story developed I got drawn in and each part of what was happening and the main character made sense. As a first film there is a lot of ground to cover, trying to get background on the company, the Assassins, the environment and character background is a lot to do in 2hrs plus putting a story in that flows, so of course it won't be perfect - but it gives a gives the franchise a good starting point and I hope more films will follow that explore the characters more and the whole Assassin world. I loved it and I look forward too seeing the next one. Most importantly switch off and enjoy it, playing the games does help understand the concept a little better but it is not vital.Highly recommended Bigot"
" really poor story
",-0.5256,0.1531,2017-01-02 00:00:00,2,"I found the story really lacking in complexity and almost fell asleep watching it. The screen play felt one dimensional in that it was written for the video game this story comes from. In recent years there have been few of these adapted stories from video games with any kind of real potential. Poor character development, poor plot, yet the acting redeems this movie to two stars without it it would be a one star movie. There are much better efforts I have seen for free on your tube. This movie leaves you wondering how the screen play ever made it into a feature film and wanting a refund of the money and time wasted watching it."
" Far better than the internet claims
",0.4404,0.9706,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Assassin's creed holds great action with great sets, costume design and I won't hesitate to say that the choreography is Oscar worthy, my only complaint is that it focuses too much on the present day story (which I actually found to be very refreshing, painting the different factions as evil or good and then revealing the truth was a surprise for me to see), instead of the past which could of used more dialect, character interactions and time (to develop a background story for the ancestor). Overall, if you like the games then i would gladly say this is a great adaption that does it justice, if you haven't seen the games at all then the movie may not be easy to follow or connect with. Just see it for yourself and hold your own opinion."

The movie has an excellent story that includes the very beginning of the hero. The story covers more than a hero's life. The movie has a very interesting balance of managing the past, present, and the future effectively. The acting was superb. The emotional factor was more than good The action was great and engaging Having a chance for a sequel is great, Cant wait for the next oneWatch and enjoy the creed"
" Goosbumps the whole way!
",0.0,0.9865,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I relived the moments of my childhood, when I was playing assassins creed every single day nonstop, playing every series until Assassins creed blackflag for every release on every date it came out.The game and its stories behind it was outstanding, and to see it re- made in a real life form with today's CGI effects and stunts was just amazing, seeing the Parkour was the most amazing thing for me. Not gonna lie, I felt like I was a kid again lol.Now to the film, it was great, there were some really good actors involved in this movie, but they didn't talk much about the history of the apple, the creed, and the Templar, so if you are reading this now and want to watch it, I recommend you play the games, or go through the scenes and walk through's on YouTube before watching this, it will make the film 10x better for you.I had wished they made the scenes with the animus more into the 1400's era instead of showing transitions of overlays of the main protagonist in and out every 2 minutes, it just became annoying. More parkour in the real assassins creed era would of been much better and enjoyable to watch.I have no idea what they plan to do in the next one if they ever plan to release it, I hope it is some other character and is dedicated to show new viewers the history of the series."
" Another failed computer game inspired movie...
",-0.0258,0.9778,2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"Maybe I'm not the best to review this film. I'm admittedly a very long lapsed computer game player, having never owned one of the major consoles for past 20 years or so. Therefore I'm well out of touch on that sphere. The only games I play are the Angry Birds games on the mobile phone. I think I'm missing out, but this film is definitely not a great advert for the genre.We have some bizarre Back to the Future/Lawnmower Man/Wanted story of present man taken back to some distant past to save the world in some bizarre mission around a masonic type centuries old conspiracy.Our lead is the wonderful Michael Fassbender, who really should have known better than to take this role. He plays it as well as he can as the lead Assassin who finds himself in the lead role. Even he can't keep it interesting, and he is supported by other good actors like Jeremy Irons. Good paycheck I guess.The story is tough to follow, or maybe as said I'm just out of touch, and I got bored. The action scenes as you expect are very well done and computer game like, but I found it hard to get excited or interested. It just got boring.I really don't have much more to say on this. This film is best left for free-to-air film channels in late night showings. A no-brainer movie that I'm feeling that even the fans of the original series of games may not even enjoy."
" Exceptional. This movie has broken the trend of bad video game movies.
",-0.765,-0.676,2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I went to watch the Assassin's Creed movie with reserved apprehension. As we know, movies made from video games haven't been very good and some have been downright awful. This apprehension was also due to the low IMDb rating of the movie as well as all the critical reviews citing it another failed attempt. However, in my opinion, 20th Century Fox and Ubisoft have done an exceptional job. As someone who has played the video game, I find that the costumes, characters, cinematography, music and special effects have all come together very well to recreate the world of the Assassins as I know it. The casting was very well done and all actors have done a very well to bring to life the unique characters they portray. The plot line is something many critics seem to find fault with, however, I feel that the story was very well written and scripted and has done both, to deliver to the gamers as well as to to introduce the non-gamers to the universe. In my opinion, the story was unique in many ways and yet had a plot line extracted from the original story of the game, thus giving me both nostalgia as well as a taste of new. Contrary to what many critics are saying, I'd rate this movie 8/10 and say that it is a very good movie and totally worth the time and money for both gamers and non-gamers alike."
" Very disappointing - is there a curse on video game movies?
",-0.7902,-0.8814,2017-01-02 00:00:00,4,"Saw this movie a few days ago and I am still shocked how bad it was. I heard of the bad reviews before, but wanted to get my own opinion. First of all there was no substantial plot at all: the whole movie bases on a small part of the story from the video game, which was also changed in a senseless way. The action scenes are directed very poorly. You almost can't figure out, how the characters move or who is who. Too many cuts and shaky cam ruin those action scenes, which should be the standing out parts of an ""Assassin's Creed"" movie. Most dialogues in this movie are either meaningless or badly written. Michael Fassbender as actor at least tries to help this movie and has a very good scence at the beginning, but still can't act against a completely bad script. I also played the video games and couldn't help me, but notice, that the essential parts of the games (the sequences in the 'Animus') didn't get that much screen time. Why the producers decided like this is a secret to me, because this parts are, what makes this games interesting. I don't recommend to watch this movie in cinema."
" Great visuals, no characters...
",0.4404,0.9545,2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,The movie had great potential but sadly the script was a mess. Justin Kurzel really did the best he could with this *beep* script and i was surprised at how beautiful this movie was shot. The biggest problem were the characters. I've never seen a movie with such underdeveloped and unlikable characters. 2nd biggest problem was that the present was boring for the most part and we spent the most time there. Positives: beautiful shot movie - exciting action scenes - good score and sound editing Negatives: underdeveloped and unlikable characters - present time is boring and dragged out - bland story In the end its a merciful 5/10 for me. Its just sad that they didn't go with a story from the games bc every AC game had a better fitting story for a movie than what they came up with...
" Had to walk out
",0.0,-0.539,2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"I'm not one to attack a movie for its historical inaccuracies but this was too much. They distort history and knowledge so bad that anyone that watches this movie may risk becoming less intelligent by its end. They portray the Templars as all bad while painting an inaccurately positive picture of a Muslim sultan. Terrible story line! The action was exciting and special effects were well done, the brain washing was too much for me to handle. It kind of reminds me of the movie Kingdom of Heaven but worse. I may attempt to watch it on video when it comes out but I had to ask for my money back. Revisionist history at it again."
" A lot of hot nonsense
",-0.4019,0.9864,2017-01-01 00:00:00,4,"Hoo boy, what a mess! It's not the worst action movie of the year, but it's the least comprehensible. And its nonsensical incomprehensibility is the kind that can only come from being adapted from a video game! I've played a little bit of one of them. I remember parkouring around some rooftops and jumping into hay carts. Much later on I learned that there's a convoluted science fiction background to the games - apparently you're in some sort of virtual reality simulation (only it's really happening in the past - or something). This film is mostly focused on the science fiction section of the games. Michael Fassbender stars as the assassin who is being forced to do the virtual reality stuff and Marion Cotillard plays the semi-evil scientist who is making him do it (kind of - eh, don't worry about it, you'll never understand it fully). One has to believe these two fine actors could have found something better to do. I just can't imagine them reading the script and saying, ""I want to do this!"" I'm sure it was more like, ""For how much?"" Jeremy Irons, Michael K. Williams, Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson also appear. Some of the action isn't too bad. It's confusingly edited at times, but it has a nice kinetic energy. It looks and sounds good, too. Still, it's lousy."
" Incorrect format for the story
",0.0,-0.9636,2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I'd like to start by saying that I love the assassin's creed games. Specifically the First game and the Ezio incarnations. The beauty of the games centres on intricately woven story lines pulling in different characters throughout a specific period in history, dependent on the game in question. This, coupled with the overarching storyline of Derek (in the early games), added a relevance to what otherwise would have been a simple hack and slash game. This was never going to be recreated in 115 minutes.The story focuses on the modern day character of Cal (see Derek) a character who has little development other than a couple of poorly written flashbacks. By focusing on this character, as opposed to the historical protagonist, misses a massive part of what balances the storyline. In fact, if it wasn't for the hastily dubbed voice over telling you that you were in the Spanish Inquisition, you would have no idea. 1000 words isn't anywhere near enough to articulate how poor this adaptation was, the lack of development of motive for any of the characters is possibly the worst offence. Abstergo want to control all of humankind...Why? Cal is on death row for killing a pimp...why?The whole thing felt like a very poor prologue. Hugely disappointed."
" Faithful and fantastic
",0.7579,0.9898,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic film and faithful to the Assassins Creed universe. As a huge fan of the game series I was thoroughly delighted with how honestly this film stays true to the series. Remarkable acting, and wonderfully choreographed combat scenes, my body moved in response to the action as though I was playing the game! It is by far one of the best films I have seen to date. I believe fans of the series will not have trouble grasping the story-line in the slightest but some aspects may need a little more explaining to non-gamers. Perhaps this side of the story can be explored a little more in a sequel, as the Assassin / Templar strife is established in the first film. This film would definitely work well as a film franchise at the same time as a continuing game franchise. Truly immersive I can't praise this film enough. Stunning settings and some heart warming nods to specific games. I look forward to the DVD release, and especially a sequel! Truly fantastic!"
" EPIC! a must watch for those who want a dose of awesomeness
",0.1511,0.8354,2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"If you read the critics' reviews, they sound like old retards who can't figure out what they are saying. I agree there was a little lack of character development, but that was because they devoted most of the movie to jaw dropping fights. This isn't Pride and Prejudice people! The realism of the fights and movements of the assassins leave parkour fans drooling. The plot was good and the cast incredible, but let's face it, you watch Assassin's Creed because the assassins are the incarnations of epicness. The fight scenes are the best I have ever seen. Be warned, after this movie you will want to be jumping off roofs and chucking pencils out of your sleeves at coworkers. :)"
" Freewill is everything
",0.25,0.9826,2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"For so long has the assassin's creed shielded Adam's apple from falling into the hands of Knights' Templar, since it contains the seeds of man's first disobedience. Something that has brought us where we are.We all like to think of ourselves as self-driven creatures, with that light of self-proclamation within each one of us. There can be no constrained interpretation of disobedience, curiosity, passion, love which are woven together, without which life itself has no meaning.Over centuries the templars and assassins have fought to gain control not over 'freewill' but rather other mankind itself. This movie gives us a glimpse of those assassin's, prominently one master assassin Aguillar whose bloodline descendant Cal surprisingly leading the Knights' present day covenant into finding the apple.The movie is a cinematic treat of special effects, armor, aerial dexterity. Although there isn't much to the storyline, if one were to think ""what after they find the apple"", but it does a pretty good job of keeping the viewers hooked. What I hoped they'd have done more elagantly was 'Animus', the lab device that helped find timeline coherence in between subject & their ancestor and immerse the boundaries of time.The answers to our questions are yet to come in the sequel, in which I hope to see Sofia (Marion Cotillard) as an assassin."
" Some good points, some bad. Worth watching.
",0.0772,-0.995,2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"The acting is great, and the fight choreography is amazing. And the movie is definitely canon as far as the games are concerned. But even great actors can do only so much with a stupid screenplay. I actually felt bad for them, with the absurd lines they had to say. All throughout the first 3/4 of the film, the main guy, cal acts like a complete moron. He gets told over, and oer , and over that he is leading corrupt scientists to something powerful. But he is too much of a dunce to listen. We are told he killed a pimp in a fight. so how did he get the death sentence? NO ONE gets the death sentence for killing one person with no pre mediation. Thats just dumb. The Spanish parts are REALLY annoying. What is the reason for a supposedly English language film being in Spanish, exactly? Also, the whole idea that Consumerism is making people complacent is kind of stupid. Yes, people who have a high standard of living tend to be more content. Because they have what they want. Duh. But as we can see with people protesting everything, it doesn't make them complacent. Truth is, spoiled kids are very demanding, and want to get their way. So, no, consumerism is not some sort of Illuminati device to make people less ""free"". You could maybe make an argument for political correctness making people less free, I suppose, in any case, an argument for a better plot is not hard to win."

It was a great piece of pure New Year's Day escapism. I had no real prior knowledge of the game or the books, but that didn't impair my enjoyment in any way. I love the idea of 'genetic memory time travel' and really hope someone else picks up on this as a science fiction plot device (maybe they have and I just don't know). I thought the acting was really good, but I'm not a proper 'critic' I just know what I enjoy. The action scenes were very well done and thrilling/gripping too. I have no idea if there are plans for a sequel but if so I would definitely go and see it. I will probably go and see this again with my other son. I recommend this, I thought it was great."
" Asinine Adaptation
",0.0,-0.9162,2017-01-01 00:00:00,4,"This review of Assassin's Creed is spoiler free ** (2/5) When it comes to video game adaptations such as Resident Evil, Doom or Hit-man etc. cinema has notoriously left them as a mass elephant's graveyard. The adaptation of Warcraft was the most recent to grace our screens and immediately plateau in the box-office, after that a lot of fans were relying on the adaptation of Assassin's Creed to end the burgeoning curse. The film's pedigree is impeccable made with the trio who drove 2015s action/adventure Macbeth to notable, brutal yet visceral heights: with director Justin Kurzel, assisted by Marion Cotillard, and of course, producer/star Michael Fassbender. And it seems that if this trio can successfully adapt Shakespeare without any problems then of course an Ubisoft production is literal child's play. While the action is spectacular in moments the story following it has problems it is, as the bard once phrased ""a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" The problems form as soon as the film starts, as Kurzel speedily whisks us through the impressive timeline from present day to the past, the plot that should help the film's stride is unfortunately a giant confusion, no, not its just confusing, it's a mess, ""what the f*ck is going on?"" our hero once shouts, we think that too as the film goes on with this plot that sounds like it has been penned by a user from Reddit. Yet, the plot isn't the first of the problems, like every other video game adaptation such as Resident Evil or more pertinently Warcraft the story revolves more around the action and not enough around the plot. Although, the film is visually stunning, as we are sent to 15th century Spain during the Spanish Inquisition to the body of Aguilar (Fassbender), this is when the film shines, though it's mostly an action spectacular at this point as he is chasing, riding horses and finally maiming the people that are constantly trying to kill him.The film looks dazzling as this is happening though we can't help but think that it looks like it's been shot digitally, but unfortunately the action is spectacular an is the main saving garce as it takes place through most of the film, unfortunately it's constantly destroyed by the wobbly camera movements and the rushed editing that moves us from the past to present showing Callum Lynch also Fassbender being thrown uncontrollably by the giant Matrix-esque Animus machine across the oppressive Abstergo arena. The past is set out like a museum tapestry that sets the tale apart between the mystical and the reality as we are rushed through the streets of medieval Spain every time the film finally stops it's fast pace, there is an opportunity to look upon the beautifully immersive streets but unfortunately the blink-of-an-eye sight of Aguilar killing yet another enemy massively takes us away from the atmosphere of the streets and takes us straight to the bloodshed, there are a huge amount of bodies cramming the streets, it no longer looks stunning.At points, the film slows down which finally starts to make us think as we are given a tour down the long bendy sometimes cold hallways with orange-hued bricks, it presents itself as a high security prison, to make us sigh in disbelief at the words of Cotillard's Dr. Sophia Rikkin ""you're not imprisoned"" as the film goes on through the first and second act Callum, starts to think he is in prison as he is constantly getting the feeling he is being betrayed, at this point the plot begins to get goofy. At other points Assassin's Creed goes back to it's footing when Lynch goes back into the Animus which in the game is a seemingly comfortable hospital bed, for a while it riffs the story that he has to find a silver-like apple shaped jewel called the Apple of Eden which is essentially an all powerful weapon that can be used as a tool for destruction, the film follows this familiar plot with the Templar's manned by Jeremy Irons' Alan Rikkin who is trying to capture the apple for himself as Lynch trying to stop him, this is when the film finally shows what it was made for.While Fassbender shines, it helps that he is assisted by familiar supporting roles such as Cotillard, Irons, Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson who do their best to keep the film going, but, sadly doesn't pull through. Fortunately Assassin's Creed isn't all dreadful as there are a couple of saving graces, firstly the action sequences which it mainly focuses on, secondly the dazzling skill set of Aguilar as he scales, runs and jumps across Spain's medieval skyline which gives the film a glossy, visceral finish. Until we are transported yet again to the present when the plot through the third act becomes horrendously goofy with the inhabitants fighting the Templar's, which is sorry attempt to save the film one last time, which now only leaves the finale to hopefully lasso the film to a skid-like halt.Despite the impeccable pedigree attached to this adaptation's title there are an immense amount of problems that by the end of the film get so large they are almost impossible to count. It seems, like every other video game adaptation this film doesn't end the ongoing curse. The bard's infamous phrase was correct as Assassin's Creed is yet another po-faced video game adaptation that signifies nothing in the world of cinema.VERDICT: Passable and fun in moments, yet hilariously inept in others, Assassin's Creed, is another adaptation that adds another – failed attempt at trying to end the curse."

",0.0,-0.9624,2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"Man I was trying not to clench my teeth through the film, but to little avail.Since seeing the previews I knew this film would not follow the premise for the games. It seems yet another good franchise has been stricken of potential greatness by the Hollywood machine that would have us always seeing through wool covered lids.YES, this applies to the majority of us humanity.In what some might call another hidden elites pandering to our ignorance, pretending to show us one thing, while using esoteric occult nonsense to put one over on us, we see and hear tons of reference to the roots of masonry, mainly from the ancient templars as they were during the crusades, and all the iconography that is synonymous with all that new pagan ritual jazz that plagues most of the entertainment industry today.Again and again we are given all the stuff that we were warned about : faking ones death in order to coerce a person into voluntary servitude, total sensory immersion systems; basically the next and far more advanced step beyond VR, and the constant use of making killers seem like the good guys.Hell even batman tried to show us that just because a groups doctrine says they are for the greater good, it still does NOT justify the means to which they would achieve their own ends.The animus machine in this is also different from the film, and though its little more than a very advanced virtual realty simulator, to the laymen, its still little more than a control to make things seem ""cool"" and "" bad ass"". The movie even states , beyond all other plot devices, that the whole problem with humanities violent tendencies is because we are not fulfilling our individual roles in our lifetimes. So we have veiled blood sports in the form of violent video games, sports that are in coliseums, reminiscent of ancient rome ( which our dumb civilization is based on), and of course: MOVIES.THis was just so poorly done, what with the lady whom subjects the protagonist into regressing having also possibly been his lover in a past life ( aka his ancestors life, YAWN)...* face palms*. IT does no justice to the first few games and earlier portion of the franchise, now turned into little more than a melee version of call of duty. Bleh."

The story could be a bit smoother and rushed a little less. However as a hardcore fan of the games, i want to know how everything ties in and the movie unfortunately does not do that. from what i can see after the first viewing there are no references to the games history. I hope they make more and expand on the universe and hopefully slow the story-line down a little bit, with more nods to the past games and whatnot."
