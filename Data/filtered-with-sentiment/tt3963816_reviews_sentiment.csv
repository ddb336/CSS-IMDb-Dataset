" This movie is better than the reviews lead to believe
",0.4404,0.8968,2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,"This movie might throw information out fast like any good and quick paced action/thriller/crime would. However it's smart, doesn't give away the movie. Reminds me of The Wire, but on speed.It's a smart fast moving crime thriller that requires you to pay attention. If you get to the end it will all unfold ans be forgiving that you didn't pay attention, however all the meat in the middle was the best parts, the tone, the pace, the acting, the lines... that was the heart of the movie.Well done movie.I can only fathom the the reviewers giving low reviews were either not paying attention or their elevator doesn't reach the top floor."
" A waste of money
",-0.4215,-0.1761,2021-02-25 00:00:00,1,It's really hard to understand how scripts of this level can be taken in consideration to be produced...
" I'm always irritated when the first 70 minutes reals me in
",-0.4588,-0.1531,2021-02-16 00:00:00,3,"This is a film that reals you in for 70 minutes, then gets convoluted ridiculously unrealistic trying to convince the viewer it was thought provoking instead of brain rotting. I won't do spoilers but through my magnanimous nature I will simply tell all to spare themselves."
" The Reds are going to have to relocate
",0.0,0.5749,2021-02-13 00:00:00,3,"If it rained this much in Cincinnati, the Reds would never get in a home game, much less 81. But the depressing weather isn't the point here. It's the plotless plot, too clever by half, full of snarling cops and bankers and other people I don't care about. Plus a bunch of bank robbers who don't do anything special other than use an app on their wrist-phones. Big deal. Anybody can burst into a bank and shoot people. That's not really that clever.I understand from other reviewers that there's a plot twist toward the end. I didn't last that long though to be honest I probably should have bailed when Willis was offering his spider monologue.There was one good line in the whole movie: as the FBI situation room is discussing who the main players are, the guy with the head the size of cannon ball looks at side-by-side photos of Wlllis and the much-younger actor who is supposed to be Willis's brother: ''These guys are brothers? They're about a century apart.""It feels like a century since I last saw a watchable Bruce Willis movie."
" ""Not everybody needs a gun to get things done.""
",0.2584,-0.3579,2021-01-25 00:00:00,5,"When you've got a scene where someone like Teegan (Christopher Rob Bowen) can get perfectly drenched from head to toe because it's pouring outside, and then appear dry as a bone once he's inside his bank building, you know someone wasn't paying attention to the script. That's just one of the obvious continuity problems in a story that keeps a lot of threads dangling when it's all over, and leaves the viewer scratching one's head. At the outset, you can keep things in perspective pretty well, but the deeper into the story you go, the murkier it becomes. It's as if the screen writers tried to pack as many conspiracy angles into the thing as possible to make it interesting, but lost focus on the overall picture. So bottom line, Bruce Willis, as he has in so many of his recent pictures, turns out to be the principal bad guy with almost no involvement in the film, although I did like his spider story to potential investors. Christopher Meloni is probably the most intense I've ever seen him in a movie, as he runs his FBI guys and the Cincinnati police department through the gauntlet to find out who's been robbing Hubert's (Willis) banks. It will slowly dawn on you when it's over that no bank robbers were ever caught, and the finale in Mexico City delivers more questions than it does answers. Don't you just hate that?"
" I gave it 2 extra stars because of the ridiculous low reviews.
",-0.5574,0.966,2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,"It wasn't convoluted. You had to be able to pay attention and appreciate an intelligent script. People now seem to give high reviews to a bunch of explosions. Period. I loved the cast, the dialogue and the plot. The bank robberies were frightening. It kept us riveted throughout. I'd love to see more movies like this. We get sick of movies that go on for entire seasons and don't even seem to know where they're going. It's nice to find good stand alone movies. Christopher Meloni and David Bautista were outstanding. Bautista provided some comic relief."
" Rain
",0.0,-0.296,2021-01-17 00:00:00,2,"I refuse to watch movies that are filmed in the dark.
Now this one is filmed in the dark and it rains through the entire move.

Story line was a minus 10.
Waste of time."
" Too much jammed into one movie
",0.0,0.4215,2021-01-09 00:00:00,5,Trying to compress a complicated plot into one movie didn't work. It could have been an excellent limited tv series that would have allowed character and plot development.
" Awful
",-0.4588,-0.9684,2021-01-04 00:00:00,2,"One of the worst turds I've ever had the horror of watching. I don't think this movie has one likeable character. Depth and nuance is attempted to be blunt forced into every main character, but its horribly executed....""my wife is dead"" ""my wife has cancer"" ""I'm supposed to be dead but I'm not"". Combine that with an overly generic and predicable rich business man in cahoots with a senator and theres a coverup plot and heres what you get.I wish I could go back in time and watch something else."
" Good 🎥 movie

" Pretty much sucked
",0.0516,-0.09,2020-12-29 00:00:00,3,"In this Robin Hood'esque movie, Bruce Willis mails in a performance that a mannequin probably could've performed.The plot is basically unbelievable but for those that like lots of shooting and explosions you at least have that to look forward to.Dave Bautista (aka Drax of Avengers fame) delivers about the only realistic performance in this otherwise awful movie."
" overdramatic and overcomplicated for no reason)
",-0.296,-0.2244,2020-12-24 00:00:00,6,"Overdramatic and overcomplicated for no reason)anyhow, is a solid one time watch!"
" Eh
",0.0,-0.7573,2020-12-23 00:00:00,2,"Everyone else's comments about convoluted plot are right.The last 10 minutes felt rushed and trying too hard to wrap everything up neatly. Ruined the whole story because of it.Bruce Willis felt unnecessary for the role and his acting showed it in how disinterested he was. Not just about the character. Just seemed like they could have had someone else who portrayed disdain for everyone and paid them less.And why was it raining, hard, the whole movie?! Seems like rain like that would have had the cops more worried about flooding than bank robberies.Only worth it if you're interested in being disappointed by endings and have nothing better to do.I was sucked in by the names on the poster and cause I'm a sucker for bank heist movies. Definitely a 2 star movie."
" Confusing as hell.
",-0.7579,-0.9062,2020-12-23 00:00:00,1,Stupid music. Poor acting. Poor editing. Nonsense story. Does not explain anything.
" Decent movie
",0.0,-0.2732,2020-12-17 00:00:00,5,"Enjoyed it or I would not have watched the entire movie. However, my biggest complaint is that there is so much background noise that it drowns might be dialogue."
" Could have been great
",0.6249,0.7108,2020-12-15 00:00:00,5,"Movie started off great. Lots of action, good story line. Then someone decided draw up the largest storyboard in movie history. Does righting a wrong make sense when you create several more wrongs. Not a horrible movie overall. Just disappointing"
" Waste of Time
",-0.4215,-0.9057,2020-12-14 00:00:00,1,"It's a movie, like so many recently, that Bruce Willis took money to be the main attraction but doesn't have much screen time. It features an implausible and convoluted storyline that doesn't make much sense in the real world. It gets worse as it goes along, trying to be more convoluted, creating storyline twists and turns, I suppose to make it more complex. Instead it just becomes stupider. The ending is absolutely horrible and made me sad that I watched the entire movie. Don't waste your time."
" Bruce why are you doing this to me?
",0.0,0.7391,2020-12-14 00:00:00,1,"What the heck man... Bruce is consistent with puting out 'B' films... The only thing this film has going for it is the criminal cool costoms . Lets be fair.. I didn't finish, but after 3/4 the way through, I was sure how it couldn't get any better.Any film that Bruce W. is in it is better to pass on."
" Not compelling!
",-0.2401,-0.9415,2020-12-12 00:00:00,2,"Marauders is full of bank robberies in Cincinnati where the only bank branches that get robbed are owned by Bruce Willis. FBI special agents, Christopher Meloni and Dave Bautista, are brought in to investigate the string of deadly heists. The storyline was complicated and all over the place. I wasn't sure what Marauders meant but it sure wasn't able raiders. If it wasn't for Meloni's performance it just felt thin and not compelling. I liked the action sequences but the acting and direction was awful. Skip this horrible movie."
" Meloni.....Nice!!!
",0.0,0.9578,2020-12-12 00:00:00,6,"You see the names tagged as the ""Stars"" in this film, and it makes you want to watch it. Regardless of whomever you think is in this film, Meloni is the star and he F...ing kills it!! Bravo! I have a new found respect for your talent.... I get it. I am a studio, and I want to sell a movie... give a big check to a name or two, to get it moving. Anymore, I watch these flicks with BW to see who is really doing the acting. Because BW phones this one in like so many others. The film is not worth the 6 stars I gave it. I gave 6 to Meloni. I look forward to Meloni as a lead more often going forward. Again, great job. Yes, I have decided to put my ratings on the stars in these B movies, not the movies themselves. Why should a great actor be rated by a not so great film. CM-6, BW-2, DB-4."

",0.0,-0.4765,2020-12-10 00:00:00,1,"This movie is absolute hot garbage. The acting is so terrible I kept checking to see if I were watching a international bootleg remake. Even the A, B, and C-list actors are just absolute trash in this, so I assume that is due to the directing. Not worth wasting your time with this unless you want to hear every single cop cliche known to man in one single movie, possibly in the first half-hour. Garbage."

So much RAIN!Fun crime drama, worth a watch, and I don't see how so many reviewers are confused by such a simple plot. Simple minds I guess.Give it a watch, take an umbrella!"
" Feds are not in local polices' chain of command.
",0.0,-0.7479,2020-12-09 00:00:00,5,"Convoluted, unbelievable plot. Some O.K acting. Seems to send the message that anything is O.K. as long it is for a ""good"" purpose. The interaction between the feds and local police is so far-fetched and wrong as to make the whole movie a joke. Why does Hollywood have to put so much senseless violence in movies and then seem shocked when real people kill real people? I tried, but didn't make it to the end."
" Why is this just now showing up on Netflix?
",0.0,0.8942,2020-12-08 00:00:00,8,"If you have Netflix, you there are a bunch of Bruce Willis movies from the past 5 years or so. Same story each time. Bruce Willis makes a cameo in an awful film and gets to cash a check. This was far, far from the case. Very good cast. Very good plot, though maybe a tad overcomplicated. This was made in 2016 and Netflix offers a ton of his more recent movies..maybe I justmissed it?
While Bruce still wasn't the star, he showed up plenty. The ""supporting cast"" carried the rest very well. Highly recommend."
" Someone Please Tell the Director and Cinematographer
",0.3182,-0.6853,2020-12-07 00:00:00,2,"That shooting a movie in the dark and rain is a cheap trick and bores me after a while. I never could figure out what was going on or who was doing to what but after 30 minutes of almost total darkness and rain, I didn't give a damn. Don't know whether the acting was good or bad because everything else was so distracting."
" Watchable
",0.0,0.8528,2020-12-07 00:00:00,4,Not a horrible movie but the storyline became too convoluted by having just too much back story for nearly every character. Action sequences were fairly well done and for the most part the acting stayed fairly solid through out. Ot would have made a much better series than a movie with all the stories within stories
" A Rainy Bummer
",-0.4404,-0.8019,2020-12-06 00:00:00,3,"This movie has so many half-ass plots and subplots going with consistent rain, it's a bummer. A complete jumbled mess with high energy acting (that's not a good thing). Miller strikes again!"
" I had to skip through it
",0.0,0.9963,2020-12-06 00:00:00,2,"I couldn't even sit through the entire movie. As others have mentioned, the plot is abysmal and far too convoluted. It's not a situation where someone is going to be like ""well, if you just really get invested in it and pay attention, the plot is good!"".No, it's just a mess. One thing that bugs me a lot about this movie is how they dangle who the Marauders are over your head for pretty much the entire runtime. I'm just sitting there looking at every character thinking ""okay is it him? is it this guy? is it that guy? okay it's definitely him. no wait now it's him"" Trying to figure out who the ringleader is and what his motivations are. This might be fun in a sort of ""whodunit"" sort of situation, but honestly it just feels like they insulted the viewers the whole movie by holding out.When it's finally revealed who the marauders are, I don't even care anymore. The leader is of course... one of the guys you probably think it's going to be out of the 3-4 guys they focus on. Wow, amazing. Then the whole thing wraps up and I'm left sitting there like... why did I even bother seeing what the ending was about?I definitely had to skip through about 40% of the movie and honestly I didn't miss anything.I give it two stars only for the decent bank robbery scenes... but to say they are ""good heists"" is a bit too forgiving. They are... I mean... functional and a bit flashy but it's not like they are super clever or interesting. It's just nice camera work and makes you feel on edge.I can't even call this a ""heist"" movie because I've come to expect heist movies to deliver really interesting and well thought out heists... and these heists are more like ""4 highly trained soldiers storm a bank, shoot some people, everyone in the bank pretty much complies and then the robbers take off with the money. the end"""
" Great movie, deserves MUCH better rating
",0.7906,0.9652,2020-12-06 00:00:00,10,"Honestly the bad reviews make no sense to me. It's not a 10 but a decent 8, had to upgrade to make up for the low numbers because it's not fair.I think ALL actors did a great job, cinematography and editing was great and the storyline was entertaining. Take a chill pill y'all this was a great movie."
" Ouch
",0.0,0.1679,2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,What a terrible movie. The plot makes no sense. The story was not complete. No clue who's mad at who and why. What a ridiculous movie. I'll say the acting was fine but the story line has absolutely no merit. Don't waste your time on this.
" It Makes You Wonder
",0.0,0.6401,2020-12-05 00:00:00,3,"I like to seek out the below-the-radar B movie that proves a pleasant surprise. This is not one of them. I understand that there are fringe people with no talent making cheap straight-to-videos in Romania but this was a surprise. You would think that with the number of people involved in this movie with experience (and some with credentials), the suits, the producers, the director, writers, actors, etc., someone would look at this script and say, e.g., ""It needs work. A lot of work."" I can't imagine that anyone who touched this script would admit it unless being waterboarded. I know we're supposed to suspend disbelief but sometimes the script makes that impossible. And if you weren't shaking your head by the midpoint, well, there's the last scene. Obviously, whatever had been written finally got someone's attention and they made the director shoot a new ending. The problem is that no one actually looked at the new ending to see if it was better than the old one and-worse-had any logical connection to the rest of the movie. It's as if everyone involved said, ""Heck with it."" It is that stupid. And by the way, when did Bruce Willis run out of money and start making movies for paychecks? He's made at least ten of them in the last five years. Bottom line: there's a lot better stuff in the action genre buried in the Netflix and Amazon libraries. Just let this one be."
" Bad ending takes it from a 7 or 8 to a 5!! Willis is toast!!
",-0.6876,0.9664,2020-12-04 00:00:00,5,Start off by saying i used to love a bruce Willis movie but hes the new nick cage who takes every part and just meanders through it. The movie was pretty good for a while then the plot goes crazy and then a stupid ending. So if you're bored nothing to watch I guess it'll do otherwise watch heat again. Oh Bautista was excellent and happy was decent as well but this was a mediocre movie at best.
" Good Action Shoot 'Em Up
",0.128,-0.9722,2020-12-04 00:00:00,7,"Not worth seeing twice or ever again but heck, it was a good film. Had good guys, bad guys, good LEOs, bad cops , long-suffering wife, murdered wife...what more could you ask for. AND Bruce being an bad mofo again. Lots of cliche...you know who's going to live and who is going to die right at the start."
" Decent Story but......
",0.0,0.5067,2020-12-04 00:00:00,4,Plot is ok and it has a fairly good cast. The BIGGEST problem with this title is the sound director and editor. They should be shot!!!

" Needs a sequel. ...minus a few actors
",0.0,0.91,2020-12-01 00:00:00,6,It's 75% fun. Christopher Meloni and Dave Bautista have awesome chemistry. Johnathon Schaech outshines in his portrayal of a conflicted officer. Everyone else isn't up to the same caliber of acting and it takes you out of the movie.Bruce is always great.
" Surprisingly good!
",0.6588,0.9512,2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"Much the same as the majority of reviews here. Good solid all round movie with a decent story and great cast. With a little more cohesion, a slightly longer run time to balance out some of the plot threads or a slightly cleaner edit it really could have been an amazing 10/10 movie. It's just lacking a little tweaking. Definitely give it a watch. Worth the time. Don't understand the low rating though. Deserves to be sitting a bit higher."
" What the hell!!
",-0.7339,0.0382,2020-09-06 00:00:00,3,Couldn't have gotten more complicated. Too many players for one. The plot and storyline.. I just don't know. Poorly executed for Suren wouldn't recommend wasting your time. Thumbs down👎🏽
" Big budget for a B movie.

" Pretty good!
",0.75,0.9009,2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"It's got a great plot, moves along quickly, held my interest. Liked the cast a lot, and Bruce Willis was terrific in this. He played against the action-hero type he's normally cast as. It was an intriguing character, and I really enjoyed his acting in this. I kinda wish he'd done more like this when he was younger! Christopher Meloni was gritty and a hard guy. I think I'd call this a noir thriller. Standout acting, imho, was Johnathon Schaech. The film is pretty violent, real blood and guts, as opposed to ""action-film"" blood and guts, but it is necessary, I think, and it isn't overdone."
" Good
",0.4404,0.714,2020-02-21 00:00:00,6,"It would have made a great 10 episode series but too much information, characters and plot lines for one sitting. Good actors and camera work but fails to make sense in the end. I feel like it was pitched as a series but the accountants decided to make it into a movie."
" I've seen worse
",-0.4767,0.8745,2020-01-18 00:00:00,5,"This movie is so messed up and incoherent that I could barely sit through the end. It's like a music video for a Kanye West song in all the glory and splendour, yet completely shallow in the inside.The single bright side is Christopher Melloni, which proves himself (once again) as a solid actor and a good choice to carry a leading character in an action movie. Everyone else is below mediocre, including Bruce Willis (who probably had to be physically coerced to take part in this)."
" Strong performances and great production values undercut by a confusing screenplay.
",0.8481,0.9269,2019-12-31 00:00:00,7,"So what I liked about ""Marauders"" boils down to Christopher Meloni's performance, backed up by a strong cast (including Dave Batista), and somewhat let down by Bruce Willis. Willis is in danger of becoming the new John Carradine (although he isn't there yet), and at points he appears to be phoning in his performance. But even at half-power, Willis is still a Pro and a Presence, so he doesn't sink the movie the way some reviewers would have you believe.What I liked 2nd most about ""Marauders"" was the sense of atmosphere - the machismo, the toughness, the sense of things starting to spiral out of control. The creators seemed to be going for the feel of ""The Departed"", and got most of the feel right.What I didn't care for was the overly complicated and confusing 3rd act that defused a lot of the momentum and interest that the first part of the movie generated. It didn't ruin the movie, but maybe someone should have been a bit more careful in the edit process, or cut out one or two of the plot twists. (Which I won't give away here).To sum it up: I liked ""Marauders"", thought it was well worth my time, but wasn't quite as good as it could have been."
" BEST HEIST CRIME MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!
",0.4344,0.9941,2019-07-05 00:00:00,10,"I give this movie a 10/10 for how the crime was portrayed. Everything about this was so well played out and it felt like it was perfect, like everything lined up. This movie isn't just a heist movie. I mean it has 3 heists and a couple shootouts but being a slight b movie it succeeded in the crime world. Its all about dirty cops and FBI double crossing each other. Now my parents loved it because they're into that stuff but im more of an action guy but this one gets a pass. Something about this was just so satisfying. I dont know how Bruce Willis gets to be in all these b movies like this one and Reprisal. It just felt like a real good movie and its one that ive been meaning to watch for a long time. Now just because i give it a 10/10 dosent mean its like one of the best ever. I sorta rate it on its genre and how well it was. This one gets a 10/10 only on the crime portion. Just like john wick got a 10/10 on the action portion. All in all its probably and 8.5 to a 9 but i just cant come up with any complaint about this movie. The actors were amazing and it was a great job. This was just as a thrill to see as the trailer and for once a movie lives up to its trailer, well that happens most of the time."
" Watchable But Story Didn't Really Make Sense
",0.0,0.3174,2019-06-27 00:00:00,5,"The story is convoluted and lacks a logical flow. The screen-writing is poor by times, much of the dialogue is tedious.Some of the acting is okay, for example Johnathon Schaech performs very well. But others in the main cast perform poorly, with Christopher Meloni over the top without the slightest subtlety, and Bruce Willis seeming flat and uninterested.The action scenes are reasonably well-directed, which makes the movie at least watchable."
" If you like heist movies then this is a must see!
",0.4199,0.971,2019-06-22 00:00:00,9,"To summarize: Super thrilling and interesting plot combined with great actors.I don't understand why the movie has such bad rating and bad reviews. I'm guessing many people fail to follow the plot, which I'll admit wasn't the easiest, but if it was too easy to follow it wouldn't have been as thrilling. I've rated Heat 10/10, and while I don't think this movie is quite on that level, I think it deserves a 9. I should mention that I'm a fan of heist movies, but fan or not, this is a great movie!"
" Decent action/crime thriller

" This is NOT a Bruce Willis movie! He has only 15 min screentime. It is just a B-movie, with a good action start, eventually going nowhere storywise. No credibility whatsoever
",0.6224,0.9904,2019-02-24 00:00:00,3,"Beware: this is NOT a Bruce Willis movie. One should expect that Willis automatically would have the leading role, but none of that. He only has got a small supporting role with just a few minutes of screen time. The other tv actors are mostly fillers, trying so hard to look tough ALL the time, that it becomes tedious.At the start of this movie everything still looks like a good old fashioned heist movie though, because at the start some (average) bankheist scenes can be seen. But these enjoyable action scenes can ONLY be seen at the very start of the movie. After that it gets rather dull. Many talking scenes in which tv actors are (desperatedly) trying to look tough. Halfway through, this movie just deflates like a balloon and truly becomes pretty incomprehensible storywise.This movie quite convincingly deceived me at the start into thinking this was an ok action movie, that could be enjoyed if one didnt expect anything special. That's the thing that bugs me the most. It starts out rather ok, raising expectations, which are then crushed halfway through. Any hope left of a good, suspenseful story is completely vaporized towards the end. I could have written a better story with my eyes closed.Endnote: I love Bruce Willis, but I suspect the guy has got a contract which obliges him to churn out 4 B-movies a year. He stars in in it for the paycheck, tickets get sold, but we only get to seen him for 15 minutes at most. That's not right!"

This one mixes in the usual bank heist nonsense with a more convoluted corruption plot, and it's all rather complex. The main problem I had is that I didn't particularly care about what was taking place, due to the cookie-cutter digital look and the blue greyed out visuals. Bruce Willis has a small role alongside Dave Bautista, but overall this is the kind of film you'll forget about the day after you saw it."
" Better Than Expected B Movie, Despite Convoluted Plot
",0.4404,0.9535,2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Whatever happened to Bruce Willis's career? Yes, he made paycheck movies in the past, too. But, nowadays, it appears he's doing nothing BUT paycheck movies! Yet I'm a sucker for police procedurals, so I gave the 2016 thriller MARAUDERS a try last night. And, truth be told, it was a better than expected B movie. Sure, the plot is convoluted beyond belief, and by the end, with red herrings and inconsequential subplots by the half-dozen, I felt kind of confused. From the look on his face, Bruce Willis was confused, too. Or just indifferent. Or bored. The plot, such as it is, begins with a brutal bank heist in Cincinnati, and all the evidence points to the owner (Willis) and his high-powered clients. But as a group of FBI agents dig deeper into the case - and the deadly heists continue - it becomes clear that a larger conspiracy is at play - but by the seventh or so twist in the story I just stopped caring. The saving grace of MARAUDERS are the decent, brutal action scenes, some nice touches in the direction and cinematography, and especially a strong lead performance by Christopher Meloni (Law Order: Special Victims Unit) as the lead FBI agent. Meloni is intense and charismatic, and he really anchors the film, and some of the supporting actors, most notably Jonathon Schaech, rise well and above the occasion. Even ex-wrestler David Bautista isn't completely awful. If just the plot wasn't all over the place. But an okay time filler, nonetheless. And in true neo noir fashion, it's raining... the entire time."
" An overstuffed film with great set-pieces and good performances.

For a direct to video feature, it is outstanding.There are two stand-outs in the film. The first is the action scenes, particularly the bank robberies. They are excellently designed and filmed with a proper amount of tension and just enough style to seem new and fresh.The second stand out is the acting. Bruce Willis isn't in the film all that much but he does do more than simply cash a paycheck. Dave Bautista also appears in a few scenes and he is quickly becoming one of those actors that elevates everything he is in. As for the three actors who carry the film Christopher Meloni, Adrian Grenier, and Johnathon Schaech is all excellent.Now Meloni could do his role in his sleep but this is the first role where Grenier doesn't make me want to slap him which is impressive and Schaech finds a Vic Mackey gravity to his role that simply wasn't in the script.
The Bad: Everyone's wife is dying or dead, everyone has a secret history with everyone else, nobody asks for a lawyer and there are about twice as many characters and three times as many plot points that a film of this genre and running time can handle.Bruce Willis is the apparent private owner of a bank with 3000 branches? A cop would have an easier time getting an interview with Howard Hughes let alone a shakedown interview in his office with no lawyers present. A street reporter starts her news report with sources tell me that ""the bad guy"" murdered all these people and stole all this money"" without any arrests being made or really any prompting except we need the bad guy to make a run for it so lets have the I-teams Suzie cut short her interview with the owner of the world's shortest llama and start flinging plot points at the screen without a single alleged uttered.The Ugly: I understand that having it rain in every scene is a stylistic choice. But you are clearly aiming a hose at an awning in some of those scenes.In Conclusion: The filmmakers should have fridged both the dead and dying wives then spent some face time with the actual bank robbers. They also could have made the connections between characters a bit clearer for those of us who are either slow or can't see through all this rain and they would have had a top-notch film. As for now, we have a confusing overstuffed film with some great set-pieces and surprisingly good performances."
" A tangled web alright
",0.25,0.9674,2018-10-27 00:00:00,4,"Saw 'Marauders' because Bruce Willis has done good films and given good performances in the past, 'Die Hard' is a genre landmark and his performance is iconic in that. The title, cast and poster also intrigued and similarly the idea for the story sounded sort of interesting, despite a lack of originality. Expectations were not high though, because Willis has been past prime for a while (several bad films and has looked tired and disengaged a lot) and has been in a lot of stinkers lately.Despite my interest into seeing it, hopes for 'Marauders' weren't too high, with a good deal of bad things heard about it and that Willis has done similar films before, during and since this film and none of them were good and used him poorly. 'Marauders' did turn out to be a marginally better film than expected but it is still not very good despite a few decent things. Do have to agree with the flaws that have been pointed out.'Marauders' did start off very intriguingly. It is shot with slickness and style.The cast mostly didn't do too badly at all, better than average. Christopher Meloni and Dave Bautista give the right amount of grit and fun and Jonathan Schaech doesn't over-compensate or look bored.Willis however phones in and looks tired in a role that is nowhere near as prominent as the advertising misleadingly indicated, something of a glorified cameo. Adrian Grenier is also quite characterless. The direction shows little engagement or finesse. The sound and music are intrusive and the characters generally aren't interesting, due to very sketchy development, with not many endearing traits.Furthermore, the action is never exciting or tense, very routine often with silly parts and over-serious ones. The script is constantly awkward and lacks tautness, but it is the far too convoluted, as well as pedestrian and far-fetched story that suffers from trying to include too many things and underdeveloping all of them that the film suffers most from. Any twists are easily foreseeable long before they appear and there is very little tension or suspense.Overall, tangled web sums 'Marauders' up very well. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

The story was interesting enough, about a group of military buddies robbing banks and rich people. The ending is a complete twist though, definitely the most interesting part of the film.Being set in Cincinnati was different, not too many heist movies there. Maybe that's why the critics didn't get it. I don't know, but the actors in the lead were not bad. Christopher Meloni played his part brilliantly, as head of an FBI task force. And Bruce Willis as the antihero millionaire was bad-ass. He was very convincing.A heist movie you shouldn't miss."

It's a shame, because there are really good attempts at character-building, but for some reason I don't care about these characters at all. Perhaps the problem is a little too much character-building across too many characters. And not enough story. Anyway, the end of the movie feels like a relief that the movie is finally over."

So the real question is, is this a story worth watching? Is it worth your time.If you are a fan of decently written, competently acted, conspiracy movies involving ex-military operators, manipulative bankers, corrupt cops and questionable FBI agents, then you should take 1 hour and 47 minutes to watch this movie. It's moderately suspenseful with legitimate attempts to bring emotional depth and interesting backstories to each of its main characters and that's something you rarely see in conspiracy movies. Does it work? Not always. sometimes it's a stretch to far. But while you're following each character's line of motivation infused by their emotions, it works until the moment it no longer works for you. You stop buying in. But the collapse of the motivations doesn't destroy the rest of the story. You just move back to the action taking place. And if you can do that, you will find it an emotionally satisfying action/thriller tale.Oh, and let me say again, all of the actors do journeyman's work here, even Meloni and Willis, although Willis' backstory told in greater depth and antagonism toward a world that wasn't giving him what he wanted would probably have made the movie actually gripping.It's still just a movie, so I think that's enough said."

" Starts off Good but drops off
",0.2382,0.9902,2018-05-20 00:00:00,6,"Well, this is another one of those straight to video films, and while it started off pretty good, it sort of nose dived about half-way through. Well, not so much so, but still, like a lot of films it sort of ground to a halt and left me rather dissatisfied with the conclusion. Not to say that this ended up being pretty bad, not at all, it was just that by the time I got to the end I was quite glad that it was over.
 So, the film is about a group of bank robbers that seem to be targeting specific banks, and killing specific people. The FBI gets involved pretty quickly, meaning that what's happening is pretty serious. The robbers are quite professional, and are certainly not your average street thugs. Further, there seems to be a bit of bad blood between the feds and the local police, but then again that seems to be a common trope.
 In a way the mystery surrounding it starts off really good, especially with the bank robbery scenes. Unfortunately, once the third one happens, everything goes pear shaped, namely because the FBI happen to be there as well. Then again, that tends to happen in these types of film. Also, the fact that there are bullets flying everywhere, and the major characters seem to escape without injury sort of defies belief.
 This is pretty much where the film grounds to a halt. Then again, that's the thing with a lot of mysteries because once it becomes apparent what is going on then, at least for me, the best part of the film is over. Actually, I suspect that it has a lot to do with the creator's ability to create a pretty awesome twist, and unfortunately, in this case, it didn't happen."

Because to be honest, this was such a complicated story that I couldn't understand what was happening while watching. Let alone that I could still retell it now. The big jumble of storylines is just as inextricable as a fisherman whose fishing line has become entangled in a bush behind him. However, the beginning was promising. An action-packed and brilliantly filmed bank robbery with the masked robbers working in a concequent way using high-tech gadgets. But unfortunately this is the only thing that causes excitement. The rest is simply too boring and an incomprehensible mess.And who to expect in a mediocre crime/action film? Yep, Bruce Willis is back. This time it's not his lamentable acting that makes him look bad, because he doesn't even get a chance to fail in that. His part is extremely limited, so we only get to see him a few times. And the boredom is easy to read from his facial expression. Although he's the central figure, the only thing he can produce is some doubtfully frowning. That's in line with previous roles he played. The only constant in his career at this moment. His picture on the film poster is bigger than his character in the film.The only character I enjoyed was Christopher Meloni as FBI agent Montgomery. An impressive guy who tries to find out why banks of Hubert International (Bruce Willis is president of) are being robbed. But as I said before, this leads to a fairly complicated tangle of plots and subplots. Before you know it, it's about a failed military operation in Afghanistan where a soldier was killed (or not?), a group of corrupt agents, corruption at a political level and the wife of a policeman who has cancer. Enough to fill a whole season of a new police serial.""Marauders"" is again such a film you better forget about quickly. The only thing that kind of stayed with me, is the fact it rained continuously the entire film."

Bruce Willis called this one in from his trailer after a night of binge drinking so if you're looking for John McClane action jackson moves and pithy one-liners from him, you wont find them here. His afternoon stubble may have been his best feature in this film.

With the course of the investigation, led by Special Agent Montgomery (Christopher Meloni) of the FBI with some minor help from the local police department, they find out that the heists have a connection with the owner of Hubert National, Hubert (Bruce Willis).I felt empty watching this movie. The story itself was kind of predictable, with a lot of hints to who were the bad guys (which should be kept a mystery until the end in this kind of plot), breaking my curiosity, leaving the movie to be dull. There were a lot of slow motions, off point slow motions, completely unnecessary. I don't like to use this word, but some lines throughout the movie felt cringy. And there was a lot, in my opinion, of pointless drama. To be fair, they did find a way to connect the drama to the main plot, but still, it would be a lot better without it in the movie.Even though the movie was predictable, there were some minor surprises towards the end of the movie, and still, the ending felt so meh. So many possibilities and yet they decided to end the movie like many others, nothing new to see here.This movie had a lot of potential. I never saw heists in movies performed like the ones in this flick, and the motivation of the criminals was interesting and different. It could've been explored differently, in a more captivating way, in a more distinct way. Disappointing.With all its flaws combined, not too long with 107 minutes, it can still be an interesting movie for people who love crime and police movies, but for me, it just didn't do the trick.

We could have then maybe, just maybe ""assumed"" that the rest of the film was just as suspenseful and intriguing that we would get too over excited if we continued to watch anymore.But ohhhhhh noooooo, just like most avid film goers we wanted to see more and more action filled scenes with a great suspenseful plot. That was our big mistake. Have you ever invested in any expensive fireworks such as The Jesters Revenge or the cheaper holiday firework staple such as the Burning Schoolhouse, proceeded to light the wick with anticipation of a burst of flame and color only to see the wick flare up with nothing but five (5) seconds of smoke and a dull Pffffft sound? Well that is how Mrs Shullivan and I felt the film Marauders let us down.There was such a convoluted plot that it reminded me more of the classic comedy skit by Bud Abbott and Lou Costello titled ""Whose On First?"" Each time a bank robbery occurred, or there was a flashback scene to the war where the U.S. special ops force were under heavy artillery gunfire we were fed another bit of a different plot line.Oh but film director Steven C. Miller saved the worse scenes for the films ending. Mrs Shullivan and I just looked at each other and said simultaneously ""Well that was a confusing waste of time that I will never watch again.""My advice to both film stars Bruce Willis and Christopher Meloni would be for ""Brucie Boy"" to stick to making another sixth sequel to the Die Hard franchise, and for Christopher Meloni to go back with his tail between his legs and rejoin the cast of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit because that TV series has went so far downhill after his departure. There was no chemistry at all between Willis and Meloni and the ending went out with a wimper and no bang. Even the macho charisma of Dave Bautista could not save this film from stinking badly. I give the film a poor rating of 3 out of 10. It is not worth watching at all."

He'd be much better typecast as a bad guy. Then there's the FBI Special Agent, most recently seen with Jayne Mansfield's daughter in TV's Law and Order, now mad at the world, looking like he needs a shave and a few good stiff drinks. Bruce Willis destroying his glass office table with a baseball bat, no doubt in anger for getting cast in this disaster. The rest of the cast look like Disney animatronic dummies, except the Disney dummies show more life and a better script.Next, the plot. What plot? I replayed a few parts of the movie and read the Wikepedia plot explanation several times, and still can't figure it out. Obviously, neither can the other reviewers...just read their reviews. The key guys wind up conveniently in the same cafe in Mexico on the same day, to try and bring this mess to an end. But how can you have an end, when there is no beginning and no middle. Here's a clue: THERE IS NO PLOT.Finally, the action. If you like seeing a bank heist conducted like a poorly executed military raid, with the added nonsense of cheap Halloween masks and issuing voice commands through a Google watch, OK, admit you're hopelessly addicted to playing video games on smart phones (clearly the intended audience).Wikepedia mentions the revenues hit $1.6 million. Wow. Not mentioned is how much it cost to make this flop, but you can bet, with Willis' minimum fee of $1-million per movie, it lost a great deal of money. There's hope yet for movie audiences if they can recognize and ignore trash when they see it."
" What a convoluted mess
",-0.3612,-0.7254,2017-07-15 00:00:00,1,"Okay I will start by saying the only reason I watched this movie was because Bruce Willis was on the cover of the poster and was #1 billed. I am a huge Bruce Willis fan having seen all of his classic movies like Hart's War, Hostage, 16 Blocks, Cop Out, Red, Extraction, etc. It was on Netflix so I though ""Why not?""Marauders is nothing but a convoluted mess of a movie and that's coming from a fan of someone who had very little expectations with the plot. But no, everything that happens is just convoluted and you can tell the writing is weak with each new subplot they throw at you. If you're a fan of Bruce Willis like me, then I am very sorry but you will be disappointed. He is barely in the film and he looks like he isn't even trying. I hated the lead actors and wanted them all to die. Note to casting directors. Dave Bautista is a piece of bullocks actor and Adrian Grenier (the douche from Entourage) still can't act. Stop trying to make him a thing. Oh and the big ""surprise twist"" in the end isn't even good. By this point we simply do not care.Bottom line. This movie is terrible. It features way too little subplots and characters that we do not care for. In the end you may ask yourself ""Why did I watch this movie?"" and ""What exactly was this movie even about?"". Trust me. Do not watch this convoluted excuse of a movie. But if you do, be warned for yourself and expect the least."
" Solid Bank Heist Thriller
",0.25,0.9971,2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"Having no expectations but some decent action and entertainment value, Marauders fills up that void. This is another film where Bruce Willis is all over the posters, and appeared to be top billing but plays a very small part. Christopher Meloni is the lead, then with Dave Bautista, Adrian Grenier and Johnathon Schaech.For a relatively small film, this film is quite entertaining though of course with better writing it could have been better overall. The best scenes and part of the film were the bank heist scenes. The attires of the robbers were very fresh as they were completely in gear (in gear from their masks on down), as well as their technique of using voice recordings during their heists. That was clever as it worked.The film could have been better with a better twist and when the ending comes, it feels very rushed and falls short. Some questions don't get fully answered as we thought they would by the end. A halfway decent twist but nothing completely new that we have not seen before. I think the problem many have with the film is the director and writer tried making it more complex of a story adding in little subplots, resulting in a more convoluted plot. A great writer could have written this much better and satisfying. Though for a bank heist thriller, Mauaraders is quite entertaining fun and suspenseful is what we watch for. Recommended, don't overly think about it too much."

Finally we see the title: ""Marauders."" It's a kind of generic title, like ""Guns of Darkness"" or ""Another Dawn."" ""Marauders"" could be a story about nosy landladies instead of bank robbers and murderers.Okay. The credits are over. We open on a scene in an ordinary bank. A perfectly ordinary transaction is taking place. The friendly bank manager escorts a matronly lady to the door, warning her to watch out for the rain that in this movie, as in the atrociously titled ""Se7en,"" never stops. Before the glass door, the manager looks up and from his point of view we see the most horrible Haloween mask imaginable, a kind of death's head, aiming a shotgun at us. The manager is horrified. Does the masked figure shoot the manager through the shattering glass door? Are you kidding? End of the first five minutes. I counted.There's no point in going through the plot because it's so ill written that I couldn't follow it. Lots of shooting and gory deaths. The director is fond of having his victims spit up blood. The prologue has warned us of ""graphic violence"" and ""brief nudity."" Too bad it wasn't ""brief violence"" and ""graphic nudity,"" although now, come to think of it, there was no nudity at all.The casting is pretty good. All the actors are of TV quality. But one of them, a human gorilla with a neck the girth of a utility pole, a partially shaved skull, a two-day stubble, and garments from the Salvation Army, rather stands out from the other, properly clad, FBI agents. What a brutish figure he cuts -- and whose was the hand than slanted back this brow? In the final, action-packed half of the movie, the camera begins to show signs that the director of photography was strung out on something. It's never still. If two people are sitting and conversing, the camera still slides slightly this way and that.I wouldn't bother watching it but others might enjoy it."
" So bad
",-0.5849,-0.8474,2017-05-01 00:00:00,2,"This movie is so bad. The actors are good (Bruce Willies, The FBI agent and the actor from Entourage) but the movie is so predictable you have the feeling through the whole movie that you have seen this already. The script is really bad. Give this a miss and watch something else instead."
" Some of its parts
",0.0,0.9161,2017-04-27 00:00:00,6,"No that is not a typo, I meant to write that. The sum of it all does not amount to what some of it is worth it. And I'm talking as a stand alone. If you've been keeping tabs on Bruce Willis you may have noticed him popping up in the odd movie or two in the recent past. Everybody needs money of course, though some do not look kindly on someone like Bruce giving his name to some of the projects he participated in. This movie can be seen as one of the better ones he chose.Putting that out of the way and the fact, he has a couple of interesting scenes, playing it mostly safe, still being effective, there are quite a few people here. But not many get really taken advantage of as much as it would be possible. And I'm not even talking Torrie Wilson or others who have very short appearances in this. No, I mean people like Bautista, Adrian G. or Jonathan Schaech. Although the latter may have the best of it. After a weak introduction, he gets quite a bit of screen time. And he delivers. Anyway, the movie is suspenseful enough to keep you interested all the way through, but it's not a real highlight. Something it could've been"
" Marauders
",0.0,0.9825,2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"The Hero of the story is a man whose wife was murdered while doing a ""bust"" (she was a cop). His Goal in the story is to find the people who are doing bank jobs, where people have been ""executed"" - It appears, therefore, that the heists are ""personal."" The first pages of the script get off to a rip-roaring start with the genre that audiences have come to see: Thriller/Action/Crime. The Story World is film noir/dark/intense/ sophisticated/tense. What happens after the first 10 pages is a mess of a script for the following reasons: First, the form of the story is branching, as opposed to linear. IE. We are taken to at least 3 or 4 scenes of a cop with a wife who is dying of cancer. For a t.v. serial, we could delve into this sub-plot, but for a thriller, it slows the pace down and takes the audience totally off-track; one scene would have been enough. The F.B.I. Hero goes to visit a man in prison - This is connected to how his wife was murdered. Again, we are taken on another branch that deviates from the Hero's Goal. This scene should have been edited out. The use of flashback to actually ""tell"" the story is a no-no in script writing. We are AGAIN taken off track by going back instead of forward. For this genre, it was a big mistake to show many scenes of military actions to sum up a character's back story. Big problem is also this: The Main Opponent needs to block obsessively whatever the Hero is attempting to achieve. There should be a punch-counter-punch between Hero and Opponent: There is none. As a result, the Opponent seems lethargic; his lines are ridiculous; he is basically in one or two locations just standing around with ""filler dialogue,"" totally unbelievable. WHY is he the Opponent of the Hero?? What is the motivation of this Opponent? What is HIS Goal? Why? None of these questions are answered because of the following reason: The PLOT was heavy with disconnected, disjointed turns and branches. The Opponent was ""inserted"" into the Plot as if he were a toy doll that needed to fulfill a script requirement. The writer did not take the time to give this character a 3D persona. It's a shame that the script didn't deliver for this exciting story idea or High Concept Premise. It got muddled and caught in a web of plot branches that should never have been there. The audience was confused by all the machinations. For a t.v. series, this plot heavy story would have satisfied 24 separate episodes. But for a feature film of Thriller/Action/Crime, the Plot turns took the audience off the Narrative Drive of the story and was confusing as well. Christopher Meloni was superb as the Hero. He's been so typecast for so long - He could be another Robert DE Niro if he'd get the parts with the depth he's capable of playing. Bruce Willis in this story was how it got produced. But unfortunately, his role was weak; dialogue ridiculous; character development written with no real character arc. The actor miscast was the F.B.I. agent, who was a special forces guy- The actor was skinny; kind of runt-like; so not like a guy who has to be in top shape. He did the best he could with the dialogue, but the part was just not for him. The Hero's sidekick ""wrestler"" played his part with some sense of humor - More humor in this type of genre would have been great, had it been written into the script. The Hero could have had a dry sense of cynicism and world-weary, wise-cracking type of personality. It would have made for a much more tense Narrative Drive. Again, the actors did the best they could with a script that lacked key ingredients. Really a shame."
" A pleasant surprise. Very very good

Compared to the drivel out their at the moment it was a refreshing change. Good story, good acting,gritty, very watchable. I can only surmise that there is an army of trolls out there paid to make some movies look good (when they are absolute garbage...Arrival being a case in point OMG) and good movies look bad."
" 'We have a robbery homicide, brutal and very personal'
",-0.6249,-0.9477,2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"For those unfamiliar with the title, 'A marauder is someone who roams around looking for things to steal.' With that concept in mind writers Michael Cody with Chris Sivertson have fashioned a whodunit that is loud, fast moving, crude and entertaining as directed by Steven C. Miller (Arseanl, Submerged, Extraction, Silent Night, etc). The plot is complex not only because of the use of masks hiding the marauders' identities, but also the interplay of corruption both corporate, military and police/FBI, and the high level of noise that covers the little dialogue there is. The story centers around a Cincinnati murder conspiracy and cover-up of an Army Ranger unit killed in a classified mission some years ago. When four armed robbers converge on Hubert National Bank, their motives throw suspicion on the bank's owner, played by Bruce Willis, and the corporate executives, as well as prominent politicians and high ranking members of the US military. The FBI Special Agent in Charge (Christopher Meloni), and his agents (Dave Bautista, Adrian Grenier, Johnathan Schaech, Lydia Hull) must decipher between truth and lies as he leads the investigation and even begins questioning whether members of his own team can be trusted. Each new twist unravels a deeper journey to determine who is truly innocent or guilty and who will ultimately find redemption. It becomes clear that a larger conspiracy is at play. Revenge plays a role, gangs are involved (Chris Hill, Texas Battle, etc), and the murders proceed until the true head of the marauding heisters is identified.Strong presence by Meloni and Grienier and Bautista carry the film and in the end the mystery is solved in fine style. The film is not unlike the multiple television crime dramas flooding the TV screens, so if that is your cup of tea, this is a worthwhile film to watch."

" Moved along fairly well.
",0.2732,0.8473,2017-03-11 00:00:00,6,I agree that some elements did make some of this score less. The robbery scenes were classy and some actions could make you wonder what was underlying in the motives.The 'BAD GUYS' did move about like an organised swat or snatch team so the thinking of rogue was not out of place. True if you then try and put the pieces together it does seem to have overlaying twists. This might not have been a bad tale to tell in a mini series as I am sure some fleshing out might have taken time.The ending perhaps did require wrapping up without satisfaction for the viewer. Luckily our lead FBI had little ambition due to his losses in life and repeated something one of the baddies had said earlier in the tale prior to killing the banker.The ROOKIE FBI agent relates an incident in his service days that is meant to help explain the underlying reason for the robberies but that did not fully come across.We have a sort of conversion by the police detective Sgt in which he dies through a perfectly delivered throat shot. What struck me as wrong is that his beloved? wife will now DIE ALONE.Another question I might have is how powerful could the Banker be in Mexico. His criminal involvement was surely fully known and all the other illegal activities also being listed daily through a federal investigation.My Mini series might have me exposing box by box that extra special rather minor bank of the franchise. Exposed like the Blacklist or Blindspot 'tattoos'. A failed attempt at a supernatural series Alcatraz tried to give us the stories of all the inmates.I was okay with the superficial story and how the action moved along especially the masked crew and feel the rating is a little low. Willis I do like but there was nothing written here that might show the Willis we know. His demise at the end probably did not have any affect on his fan base if watching. Although not portrayed as EVIL he was a bad man. Maybe Willis cannot actually play evil like the antagonists in the die hard tales.I have watched 'action' movies I felt less about get much higher ratings.
" Crime action film with a ridiculously convoluted plot that's impossible to understand
",-0.7096,-0.9982,2017-02-02 00:00:00,1,"When I first saw the poster for this film, I was expecting a rather straightforward action flick about criminals robing banks and policemen trying to stop them. Instead, what I got was a convoluted mess of a film in which some bank robberies do happen, but they are merely a part of an extremely complicated story that involves political conspiracies, dark secrets from the past, assassinations, betrayals, and plenty of other stuff that will almost certainly leave the viewer baffled and confused.Basically, the plot summary is that a group of masked soldiers are robbing banks that all belong to a suspicious businessman called Hubert, who is played by Bruce Willis. However, these robbers don't want just the money, but instead they are performing these robberies in order to steal certain objects that Hubert personally left in his banks as well as kill certain bank employees that were employed by Hubert personally. The reason why they do that is because Hubert did some very bad things in the past, and now they want to exact vengeance upon him. Now, I'm not going to spoil anything, but let's just say that what Hubert did in his past was to organize some kind of political conspiracy in order to remain the owner of his banks, and that conspiracy resulted in the deaths of many innocent people. Therefore, the objects that the robbers steal are some kind of incriminating documents that helped Hubert organize the conspiracy, and the killed employees were involved in that conspiracy. Then a group of FBI agents lead by a frustrated Agent Montgomery, played by Christopher Meloni, starts investigating these robberies, but while doing so they also start uncovering this conspiracy. After reading all this, you may think that I'm explaining the story with too many details and revealing too much, but the thing is that all that is just the most basic starting plot which gets even more elaborate and convoluted through a series of plot twists, subplots and flashbacks. Halfway through the movie, the story becomes pretty much impossible to explain! The worst thing is that many questions do not even get fully explained by the end of the movie, and the most notable one is: How did Hubert manage to organize such a complicated political conspiracy? The movie is made even more convoluted by some needless subplots. The most notable ones are the story about Montgomery's wife, who was also an agent that was killed while undercover, which has no influence on the main plot, as well as a strange subplot about a policeman who is also investigating the robberies and whose wife is suffering from cancer. I don't even know what the point of that character is, but that subplot is concluded in a very bizarre, if not ridiculous, way.Other than the messy story, the movie also has some action scenes, but they're nothing special. I liked the first bank robbery scene, which was actually quite intense and well shot, but everything goes downhill from there. One of the later robberies involves some kind of a lengthy armed standoff between several characters that looks simply ridiculous.As for the acting, Bruce Willis gives a rather routine-like and forgettable performance. Meloni plays the main character and he goes through various emotions throughout the movie, though I personally did not like his performance. There's also WWE superstar Dave Bautista playing Meloni's partner, but he does not do anything memorable in the movie other than spear-tackling a bad guy once. There are also many other supporting characters, if not too many, and it's kind of hard to keep track of all of them.In the end, I kind of wish this had just been some kind of a ""B movie"" about heists that's easy to follow, and not this mess."
