" Cluttered
",0.0,-0.9715,2021-04-07 00:00:00,3,"Everything original, dark, frightening and unsettling from sinister became unfortunately just another mash up in a franchise. Gone is the creepy atmosphere, replaced by random talk and disjointed jump scares. And no, I don't get the obsession with kids in horror movies. It simply doesn't work (with the big exception of 2009' Orphan). Watch & fear sinister 1 and consider it as done."

" It tries to scares us at the end, it didn't work
",-0.34,-0.9393,2021-03-02 00:00:00,1,They suck at scaring. I hate movies that try to scare us and they dont. It makes me want to write a review saying it doesn't scare me.
" I think this was a great sequel
",0.6249,0.6249,2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,"It appears their were a few different schools of thought for what was expected from this sequel 5+years ago. I watched both movies more recently, long after the initial hype, and I think this sequel is a great extension of the first."
" Not a bad sequel
",0.431,0.3087,2021-02-07 00:00:00,8,I'm surprised by the low ratings for this. It has it's own style of horror/thriller and I found it really chilling which is what I wanted. Not a bad effort at all.
" Not as bad as others say
",0.431,0.9105,2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,Honestly I found it just as good as the first one. I love how they continued to develop the story. It's very disturbing and slightly graphic as is the first one which at times I have to remind myself that it's not real cus it's so freaking creepy to me. But I think both sinister movies were highly original with excellent acting and I like the ending of this one more than the first at least it kinda made me feel better at the end
" Misses the point
",-0.2263,-0.8146,2020-11-30 00:00:00,4,"While the movie started promising it quickly went down hill.Gone is all the mystery and the atmosphere of the original, this movie takes the direction of standard ghost/slasher flick with cheap jump scares you see coming from mile away and stupid looking villain character, just standing there in the open most of the time, like an idiot, rather than hiding in the shadows, like he did in the original.Acting is not nearly as good, even campy at times, characters are pretty badly written and dialogue is often cringe worthy.Even killing scenes are not that great - some are ok, but others are pretty absurd, even laughable and seem pretty impossible to set up for a kid - which was the whole point in the original.Overall I'm very disappointed, that this movie took the turn from clever horror to cheap thrills and laughable stereotypical villain. If Sinister 3 will ever be made, my hope is that it will go back to its roots rather than continue going into this direction."
" Honestly not a terrible follow-up to the first movie
",0.6761,0.9382,2020-11-08 00:00:00,5,"If you're going into this movie holding it to the standards of the first one- yeah, you're going to end up disappointed. But on its own, this actually isn't a bad movie. It's not terribly scary, but it has its moments and is entertaining enough."
" I liked it, solid horror
",-0.0772,0.4019,2020-10-31 00:00:00,7,"I liked this one as much as the first, just differently. I dont know why all the bad reviews. The first one was the parents perspective, this one shows it from the childrens perspective. Therefore, it helps give an all around idea of how Bughuul haunts. They showed Bughuul more than they did in the first movie so I liked that."

" Shameful Sequel
",-0.4939,-0.9956,2020-10-20 00:00:00,4,"Yet another pointless horror sequel, Sinister 2 squanders what the first one conjured up, providing less scares, less originality, and less of a coherent plot and direction to go off of. I am a huge fan of the first Sinister film, so believe me when I say that this one is nothing but a grand disappointment. The sad thing is that it did have some things working for it, although the potential it had was often futile in the hands of the writers and director who made this film. There are a few interesting little things in the film. There is some good tension towards the end, some new information that comes to light, and a new point of view. However, none of it feels even with the rest of the film. The biggest mystery of the film is how the first film went from making something so horrifying, to something rather dull and predictable. There are far too many jump scares throughout the film to provide for any real frights, and although it does provide for some intense moments, the family narrative throughout can feel a bit generic and worn down- a situation we have seen far too many times in film, and in horror in general. The performances are okay, but many of the lines justs seem to awkward for any actor to perform, and it becomes its worst when they take them so seriously. Its cinematography is grim and awfully uninspired, and its direction is honestly quite horrible. It goes to show not only how good Scott Derrickson is at directing in the first film, but also how pitiful an film experience can be without a vision to guide it. In the end, Sinister 2 is a misfire, and is rather unforgivable. A few cool moments can never make up for what could have been an outstanding franchise, and it really is a shame the series had to die this way.
My Rating: 4.5/10"
" Thats really little bit nice
",0.4186,-0.9231,2020-10-20 00:00:00,3,Sinister 2 is many roles of a mother hiding out from her abusive ex-husband and her family which implied they using black magic against her will so they can control her via bughuul's spells because her family is likely is a cultist which help ex-husband to find her while male protagonist is ex-deputy who tried to stop the curse and cultist before it's too late.
" The Only Good Thing About This Movie is James Ransone
",0.4404,-0.5386,2020-10-04 00:00:00,3,"This movie wasn't the worst that I've seen but I think it was mostly because there was so much of James Ransone and Shannyn Sossamon in it (I love them). The story starting off was done well, and the abusive husband trope was done tastefully surprisingly (in the sense, there was a reason for him to be there to move the story forward. Abuse is never tasteful no matter what.) I thought the movie was decent and I was interested more in the characters then the horror itself, so I originally planned to give it only five stars. Then the universe breaks it's own rules by having bughuul kill the child Zach and then, presumably, the deputy (James Ransone's character). That was when I just fully lost it. Like the first sinister movie, it's a fun watch for the first time but I don't think I'd ever be interested in watching it again. Well, maybe just for Hames Ransone but that's it."
" Better than you think
",0.4404,0.9336,2020-09-19 00:00:00,7,While it has a lot of jump scares they are effective. The kids in this movie are great. I love the twins in this movie especially. While it's not as good as the first film it is a worthy sequel. Definitely worth a look.Tim Treakle
" Disappointing!!!!
",0.0,-0.9698,2020-09-02 00:00:00,1,"The first Sinister had me with my jaw dropped and I was genuinely scared. This movie does not check 1 box the old did.Let's start with the found footage films in this movie. They are wayyyy to much. The scary part about the videos in the first film is that they were simple and I believed they were things a child could pull off. There's a killing in this one that includes the kid hanging them over the water and an alligator jumps up and eats them. Like WHAT!!! How could a child pull this off before anyone even notices they are missing, so much plays into it.2) the possessed kids in this one suck so much. The reason the mystery behind the children in the first one was so scary was because we did not know anything about them at first or why they were missing. In this movie they just talk with the kids and are friends with them and it's so stupid. Terrible acting by the whole cast except for the deputy. And Jonas wasn't even in this one.The bickering between the kids as to who would be the one to kill the family to earn their spot in this possessed gang is hilariously stupid and the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in a horror movie.I hate to rant like this but this movie really grinds my gears because the first one is a 9/10 and this trash deserves nothing"
" Dissapointing!
",0.0,-0.9693,2020-08-24 00:00:00,5,"Meanwhile ""Sinister"" (2012) was one of the best horror films of the 2010's, a creepy film, this sequel is a great dissapointment, the script was stupid and not scary at all, the cinematography is cheap and the film locations not that good for a horror film. The jump scares are bad, obviously that was the worst mistake of the film, a good point is Shannyn Sossamon's acting. A bad sequel, a real flop!"
" Good movie
",0.4404,0.5256,2020-07-26 00:00:00,7,I really enjoyed the second movie. I thought it was much better than the first one where it takes ages to figure out what's going on. Shame there won't be a third one.
" It's not as good as the first one, but it's still worth it.
",0.1648,0.9855,2020-07-25 00:00:00,5,"As I have already mentioned several times in other reviews, I see film sequels with some caution, knowing that many of them serve only to raise money from the public and do not reach half the quality of the first film. This case is just another one that follows that line. If the first film was very good and worked quite well, this one has turned out to be much weaker.In fact, this film repeats, with some nuances, the same formula that we saw in the first one, without the advantage of the element of surprise that worked very well the first time. Once again, we see a house haunted by Bagul, an evil entity that turns children into murderers of their own families. Again, we see an innocent family being victimized by this entity, while a retired policeman, whom we saw briefly in the first film, tries everything to save them.Ciarán Foy assures the direction whereas Scott Derrickson, who directed and wrote the first film, limited himself to signing the script this time. Maybe that's why the film is never as good as the first. It manages to create a tense atmosphere around the house and the evil that surrounds it, but the fact is that we already know what that evil is and what its capable of, so everything that follows is easy to guess. The film has its good moments, there are some scares that work well and make the film worthwhile, but in general it is much weaker.James Ransone was good enough in his role and is supported by Shannyn Sossamon, with whom he seems to collaborate quite well and create a convincing chemistry. Robert Daniel Sloan, given his age and inexperience, was very good, while Dartanian Sloan was weaker. At a more technical level, the film closely follows its predecessor, with an elegant and well-made cinematography, especially in the footage that reproduce the home movies. The soundtrack is very good, but it seems copied from the initial film, with slight additions."
" Sequence horrible
",-0.5423,-0.7906,2020-06-01 00:00:00,2,This movie sequence horrible. The children are horrible actors
" It was Sinister!...For the last 30 minutes
",0.0,0.9851,2020-05-21 00:00:00,6,"So yeah...I...thought the film was okay. Here is my reason whySo Dylan and Zach(Twin Brothers) and Courtney(Their mother) recently moved into the house that has the curse of the Boogeyman. But for some reason, the film literslly established that Dylan and Zach met the kids the Boogeyman captured. I was thrown off and the plot was confusing to me. So I will give you the positives and Negatives of the film.Positives:
I like they brought back officer So and So. He plays a bigger role in this movie and I appreciate that.
The kids the Boogeyman captured, specifically Milo, was actually somebody that was pretty chill
I thought some of the scares were creative. Some I said
And the last 30 minutes of the film was awesome
So and So and his friend discuss about Bughuugal and his sinister waysNegatives:
The last 30 minutes of the film was awesome! But the entire hour of watching this film, I was uninterested. I kept questioning the decisions that happened in this film, and their were a lot of moments where I went WTF just happened?!
They show too many ""family movies""! In case you don't know, These ""family movies"" are kids videotaping their families before killing them off. I honestly felt like they showed it too much in this film to the point where I said...Stop. Can you blame me? Like, If you kept sawing the video tapes, you would automatically know what would happen. It's so receptiveI originally was going to give it a 5, since a 5 means Meh in my rating system. But the last 30 minutes plus the positives made me boost the rating. So It's a 6.1/10 for me."
" This one wasn't very Sinister
",0.5208,0.5307,2020-05-05 00:00:00,4,"This sequel had a lot to live up to, and it didn't quite get there. The original was a great movie. Sinister II isn't bad, but it's slow at times and it strays from the formula of the first. The 8mm films didn't seem as legit, and bringing the undead kids to the forefront made the film a bit cheesy. The cast and production are decent, but lack depth due to a lackluster script and story. I'll watch a third installment if one is made, but part of me hopes that doesn't happen."
" preferred it to the first , better plot line.
",0.4404,-0.8808,2020-04-10 00:00:00,6,"Although this title is much poorly reviewed than the first i preferred it plot line much more as well as how the story enfolds.
With terrifying violence and an even more carnage Sinister 2 had a better ending than i expected with a much more compelling harsh reality , they cannot escape Bagul."
" It was all there .... then it just wasn't
",0.0,0.9732,2020-02-22 00:00:00,5,This film started out great and then it just fell apart ....... This movie depended itself on the children that have already past and that was a great idea at the beginning !! Then it just ended up like bread with no butter POINTLESS ? Strong actors that were given very little chance to shine it just didn't do it for me. I rate this a 5 Because the potential was there but it just wasn't put together like how the original was . Overall it is another standard film but nothing to great and nothing to awful to be worth of a rating lower then five !
" Solid but didn't live up
",0.0772,-0.5794,2020-02-06 00:00:00,6,Not as good as the original but still an okay horror movie. Maybe if it didn't involve the kids so much the scenes could have been more graphic.
" Actually Not That Bad
",0.431,-0.9924,2020-01-19 00:00:00,7,"A lot of people seem to be disappointed in this movie, and comparing it to the original, it's definitely not a fantastic sequel. Or a great one. Sequels rarely live up to the hype that their predecessor stirred, but that isn't an excuse to make a shoddy part two to a story that didn't need it. Did Sinister need a sequel? No, but I'm still curious by this world that Bughuul can insert himself into. Even with all it's flaws, bad jump scares, and sluggish story telling, I actually did find myself enjoying this movie.What fascinated me the most was that this movie was mostly from the view of the children, twin boys Dylan and Zach, and how they were trying to be influenced by the other kids that Mr Boogie were able to keep a hold of. The ghosts from the first movie are nowhere to be seen, apparently since ex-Deputy So & So has started a string of arsons, burning down any houses owned by previous victims to try and wipe out the cursed line. I really enjoyed seeing Dylan trying to cope and process having all of these dead children in his house and trying to force them to watch the videos they made of them, promising him that he won't have any more nightmares if he watches all of them, but he only manages to watch about one video a night. Zach gets very jealous of the dead kids choosing his brother over him, even going so far as to beat up and belittle his twin to try and convince the ghosts that he is more worthy.The thing with the mom running away with them because of domestic violence IS a sort of interesting little tidbit, but it didn't really add anything to story, other than a way for the ex-Deputy to sort of become a very brief pseudo-father figure. It's easy to see how the mom, Courtney, was charmed by this soft spoken and awkward man after escaping her brute of an husband. It's weird not getting a name for the ex-Deputy, he spends most of the movie correcting people when they call him Deputy with just 'not anymore' or 'I'm a private investigator now', but we didn't get an identity for him. We get Courtney, Zach and Dylan, the abuse husband Clint, Dr Stomberg at the university, the dead children (Milo, Ted, Emma, Peter, Catherine), but no name for one of our main protagonists. It made me struggle a little to connect with him, so near the end when he was beaten up, it was rough, but I couldn't be completely sympathetic about his rough treatment since all we had to call him was ex-Deputy So & So or the PI.It wasn't as scary as the first one, the story wasn't as strong as the first one, the characters weren't as thought through as the previous ones, but I could probably see myself watching it again. The twins interacting with each other and how their relationship soured as Bughuul grew closer to nabbing one of them was a good detail, and actually seeing the dead children affecting the next kid the evil entity wants was really interesting, it was something I was curious about in the first movie. Yes I'd recommend it, but I'd also say take it with a grain of salt, but I would still say a decent watch."
" Same of the first one
",0.0,0.0,2019-12-25 00:00:00,6,"The movie does not bring some new content, new plot or new development that fix or enhance the content. However, it keeps the same theme again and again. Has all pros of first movie but it is the same. 6/10"
" Better than the first
",0.4404,-0.7625,2019-12-19 00:00:00,7,"Sinister 2 is a rare breed - a sequel that I enjoy more than the film that proceeded it. Ciaran Foy directed it from a script that was co-written by the original film's writer and director, Scott Derrickson. James Ransome is the only character that returns as Deputy So & So.The movie starts with one of those Super 8 films from the original, as a family is hung like scarecrows before being burned alive. It's a nightmare in the mind of nine-year-old Dylan, who is on the run from his abusive father, along with his mom (Shannyn Sossamon, A Knight's Tale) and twin brother Zach.Each night, Dylan is visited by a gang of ghostly children led by Milo. They make him watch all manner of horrifying movies where alligators devour families and rats eat their way through parents' stomachs.The deputy is now a private detective on the trail of the murders from the first film, including the Oswalt family. He figures out that an abandoned farmhouse is the first of the homes infected, so he heads out to burn it to the ground, before learning that Dylan and his family are living inside it.The deputy falls for Dylan's mom and also is given a ham radio that once belonged to occult investigator Professor Jonas, who has disappeared. The radio came from a Norweigan family that was killed in 1973. There's a recording of the family where a young girl yells about Bughuul.That boogieman is now targeting Zach, not Dylan, using his jealousy and the abusive nature of his father to destroy the family. When his birth father kidnaps them all, he takes advantage and crucifies them in a cornfield, setting his father ablaze. Only after the deputy destroys the haunted camera does the carnage stop, with Bughuul arriving to destroy the young boy.If only the film ended there. The jump scare at the end where Bughuul appears in the deputy's motel room feels out of character and a cheap way to milk a sequel out of this idea, but hey - what do you expect?That said, this movie has even more haunted Super 8 films - well, these ones are shot on 16mm stock - and some pretty decent attempts at frightening its audience. It's also pretty much a cover version of Children of the Corn. I prefer how the original film was more enigmatic about Bughuul and his motivations, but this movie really amps up the intensity. I saw it at a drive-in, which is quite possibly the best way to see an escapist horror film, right?"
" Sequel is not good (5.4)
",-0.3412,0.0724,2019-12-11 00:00:00,5,"It was a very bad sequel to be honest I didn't like the first film anyway, but the first film it was more scary.Pretty horrible story as a subject really creeps and the first film actually succeeded but the sequel fails so much about it of course, the continuation of each film is a bit worse.The only thing i love in this movie is the first movie with a nice connected other than that it was a simple and unsuccessful film"
" If it had any real feeling to it
",0.128,0.4943,2019-11-20 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed the movie. That being said, there was too much wrong with it not to point out that those involved didn't have a tight narrative before starting.There is the romance between the single mother and the deputy, which is endearing and totally unexplored. There is this new scientist showing up with a radio signal that is a potential for further methods of spreading boogie or buughul, but that too is totally unexplored.Instead the focus is on the child, who must watch all the films. The films that were watched by the child in the first film. A child who is not part of the timeline of children in this iteration because this film was meant to explore a different vein. It gives us a record player, unexplained and unnecessary.Mass communication is so much scarier. CB radio is nearly as antiquated as Super 8. If the radio avenue had been explored, maybe the children could've been into ham radio or it could've been an old CB that there dad had, a dad who is dead or ends up finding them right before the child decides to kill his family, give him room for pause and then room to realize that his father was an abuser.Instead the audience has to root for the death of a cheesy archetype to die, and we're given what they told us we asked for. Instead of an homage to the Shining, we have the vague connection of a single mother who is a creative, but there is little recognizable intertextuality at play here.Don't misunderstand, I found the movie was entertaining, but it wasn't as compelling or as fun as the first. I still really want to see a third movie in the franchise, as I find the potential for more refined lore from the universe exciting."
" Nope!

" A Sort of Shameful Sequel
",-0.4939,-0.9996,2019-10-27 00:00:00,3,"If you have the same expectations for ""Sinister 2"" as the excellent original production you're setting yourself up for disappointment. This film lacks any true terror or strong character development compared the first movie. Half of the time it doesn't seem to really take itself seriously especially in the case of the inept Ex-Deputy No Name (he's never given one). Ex-Deputy No Name starts seeing ghostly figures from the beginning yet he just kind of takes it in stride as he tries to get to know Courtney Collins and her two sons Zach and Dylan. It seems Courtney & sons are on the run from a very abusive husband/father named Clint. Ex-Deputy No-Name runs into their family staying at the property that he was sent to check out as a private investigator for all the mysterious deaths that have occurred there. In the meantime Dylan begins having visitations from ghostly children (no big deal, that's how he reacts) who take him to the basement to watch old films of different families being murdered in different ways. The ghost children tell Dylan this will ""help"" him with his nightmares. Dylan doesn't like it and keeps telling them he wants to quit watching. Later it's revealed that his brother Zach can see the ghost kids too and he's jealous he wasn't chosen by the ghost kids to be part of their activities. They tell Zach he's too weak so Zach beats the Hell out of Dylan in front of them in an effort to prove he's the stronger. At first the ghost kids reject Zach and he threatens to tell his mother about everything. The ghost kids threaten to kill his parents but that doesn't seem to worry Zach but it does Dylan. Out of the blue Clint the abusive father shows up with some state troopers and tells Courtney he wants the boys back. Ex-Deputy No Name tells the head trooper some BS story that sends them away for the moment. Later Ex-Deputy No Name and Courtney hook up, kind of. The next day Ex-Deputy No Name goes to meet a scientist/doctor who in a very cheap, cheesy scene shows how the evil ""Bughuul"" can be traced in patterns on HAM radios. It then talks to them! It's a silly part of the film and they even joke about it. Clint comes back with the sheriff and this time he gets Courtney and both boys. They get a few clothes and he takes them home to his house. Somehow, though it's never shown, the big chest with the old movie camera 🎥 projector from down in the basement that filmed the family murders is brought to Clint's house also. Ex-Deputy No Name figures out that Courtney & sons are gone and at Clint's. He goes over to warn them about the impending danger forecasted by the HAM radio but Clint proceeds to immediately whip Ex-Deputy No-Name's collective ass. After all Ex-Deputy No-Name is no Ethan Hawke from the first movie. After getting pummeled, Ex-Deputy No Name leaves and the ghost kids move to make Dylan watch the final murder home movies. He refuses to watch the last one but unfortunately Zach is doing that. Luckily Dylan did manage to text Ex-Deputy No Name one time before this happened. When Ex-Deputy No Name shows up evil Zach has managed to tie up Dylan, Courtney and Clint like scarecrows in a cornfield. Zach then torches his father Clint and films it. Just then Ex-Deputy No-Name drives in and hits evil Zach with his SUV. Evil Zach somehow gets up??? And then he picks up the camera and a sharp hand sickle. He proceeds to film, chase down and chop off part of poor Ex-Deputy No Name's hand. Somehow Ex-Deputy No Name, Courtney and Dylan escape back inside the house. Now the ghost kids help evil Zach search for them. And just when it appears evil Zach might might get to chop up Courtney and Dylan (but you knew he wouldn't) Ex-Deputy No Name jumps in and saves the day by breaking the camera 🎥 evil Zach was filming with. Evil Zach runs off in despair, like a witch who's melting, and goes to meet the ghost children. They curse him for failing to kill all the family, saying now they can't ""come back"". Bughuul finally shows up (he doesn't do much) and turns evil Zach into what looks like a ghost-like zombie Polaroid picture which burns up because the house has somehow conveniently caught on fire 🔥. This of course leaves no proof or evidence of what really happened. The next scene shows Ex-Deputy No Name apparently with Courtney and Dylan and apparently having left with no explanation for the authorities as to what just occurred. The last scene is just plain idiotic, relegating it to almost a spoof. Ex-Deputy No Name enters a cheap motel room and all of a sudden a HAM radio blares! Then Bughuul's smiling face comes looking at the screen. SMDH, lame."
" A Disappointing Sequel
",-0.4939,-0.987,2019-10-24 00:00:00,3,"Being a big fan of the original Sinister, when this movie was announced, I was excited yet leery (and rightfully so). I put off watching this movie for years because I didn't want it to ruin how I felt about the first movie. Luckily, it didn't. It did, however, disappoint me greatly.Let's start with the actors. They're not good. The main actor (James Ransone) is not right for this role. I have no problem with him as an actor, and actually loved his character in It Chapter Two. However, this role was not the right fit for him. I understand they wanted to link it to the first one somehow, but I don't think this was the way to do it. His acting and lines are delivered awkwardly, and I can't blame him for having to work with poor writing. Other than James Ransone, none of the other actors made me care about them at all. Poor writing and line delivery all around.Somewhat of a spoiler, but the main conflict within the story has to do with an abusive father and it's not believable in the slightest. This abusive father that quite literally sent one of his kids to the emergency room is somehow able to obtain a legal document granting guardianship to the kids he abused. In what reality does this happen?Beyond all that, it's just boring. Nothing happening, nothing scary, etc. Skip it and re-watch the first one."

Take everything good about the concept, drag it through the trash, and bring it to cinemas. There you have Sinister 2. I suppose some of the tapes had a sliver of the original's magic, but the entire rest of the movie was worthless. This was an upsetting movie, but only in the sense that a unique and decent idea was desecrated by a sequel that need not exist at all."

" Sinister 2 was less frightening than Bughuul having a good ol' boogie with ghost children.
",-0.7357,-0.9929,2019-06-20 00:00:00,3,"Derrickson's original horror film was, much to everyone's dismay, an unexpected surprise for me. Sure some of the jump scares were insanely stupid (the laptop screen moving? Gimme a break...), but the grisly plot, Hawke's acting and cinematography were alluring. Naturally, an unnecessary sequel was to be spawned from the depths of Babylonian mythology, and it's a slapdash low-budget effort with no real purpose to it. No scares, no noteworthy performances and certainly no artistic memorability. Yawn! A family on the run from their abusive father, experience ghostly apparitions who were taken by Bughuul at their rural farmhouse. But Deputy, I mean, Private Investigator ""So & So"" is on the case to stop this chain of horrific events.Right, so this is pretty much a lesser re-hash of the original, ""okay?"". Uninspired Super 8 mm films of death, ""okay?"". Bughuul standing there looking all cute, ""okay?"". And a terribly dull performance from Sossamon who says ""okay"" in every frickin' sentence whilst obviously chewing her gum like a cow grazing, ""okay?"". ""Okay."". ""Okay! Okay! Okay!"". The abusive father sub-plot, although heavy handed, had some ground for deeper thematic purpose. But then the third act arrives, which was depicted several times in nightmarish visions so was hardly a surprise, using every horror cliché available to ensure that any literary meaning had been taken by ""Mr. Boogie"" himself. Wait, how did obviously violent father find the farmhouse again? I may had dozed off...!Regardless, problem is this sub-plot takes precedent over the continued storyline from its predecessor. So the scenes involving the Deputy felt like filler just to throw in some obnoxiously loud jump scares, with the same sound effect as the ""lawnmower"" Super 8 footage from the first film. Oh, and it ends on a jump scare with ""Mr. Boogie Wonderland"" peeping his head on screen like an unwanted child. Just leave me alone! Aside from some atmospheric sequences, such as the ominous shadows in the church, this was pointless. Next!"

" Shameless Cash In
",-0.34,-0.9905,2018-11-12 00:00:00,3,"Sinister 2Format: Amazon Prime Language: English Released: 2015Director: Ciaran FoyStarring: James Ransone, Shannyn Sossamon, Robert Daniel SloanLet me start with a question; one that you would have hoped the film studios asked themselves before giving this film the green light; How do you follow up a sleeper hit such as Sinister? Their answer, sadly, seems to be,
""We don't care, just make us some money"".The story revolves around two boys, whose Mother, Courtney Collins (Shannyn Sossamon), is on the run from her violent ex-husband, being made to watch homemade films by what I can only imagine are meant to be ghost children. The boys Dylan Collins (Robert Daniel Sloan) and Zach Collins (Dartanian Sloan) are not only unconvincing as brothers (which is highly amusing as they are real life siblings) they are also so blood boilingly annoying that you end up hoping they fall prey to the demon, Bhughul, as soon as possible. On the subject of Bhughul, the demon responsible for making the children commit such horrific crimes in the first place, he seems to have been reduced to nothing more than a cameo in his own film for reasons unknown.The main triumph of the first film, was, in my opinion, the 8mm films of the killings. This helped, not only build up the atmosphere but created some good off-screen space in terms of the world the characters inhabited and character development. They are a mess in Sinister 2. It was like watching scenes from one of the Final Destination films in 8mm; there was no point to them other than to try to add shock value; but Foy, failed utterly and they were just so bad it wasn't even funny.This film is in no way, shape or form, anything other than mediocre, even the acting from James Ransone as Ex-Deputy So & So and Shannyn Sossamon as Courtney Collins is nothing special. It is sadly like the rest of this film, just about passable.It's hard to put my finger on what Ciaran Foy was thinking when he made this film, a weak story filled with weak performances and at times questionable film-making made this a huge let-down. Where the first film gave you an engagingly creepy and eerier atmosphere, albeit light on plot, this film doesn't even try and I am left asking if Ciaran Foy even watched the first film. Sinister 2 is nothing but a simple cash in on the first and a completely forgettable one at that."

",0.4215,0.2708,2018-10-05 00:00:00,8,"Obviously, there's virtually no mystery left to solve, since Ethan Hawke put in all the legwork in the first movie. So if you're expecting a whole new set of twists and turns and mysteries, you're gonna be let down. For me this was more about being invested enough in the characters to care what happens to them, which I was. Sure, it's not without its flaws and plot holes but frankly neither is the first. I thought this was much faster paced, had more ""scares"" and more richly developed plot lines and characters you actually cared about. It held my attention throughout, and I have seen much worse movies, let alone sequels. I wonder if everyone who had a ""negative"" review of this one would have felt the same way if this was the first film, or a standalone. I avoided this for a year because of the low rating and what I learned is that sometimes you just have to see for yourself. Just make sure you don't watch a copy you found laying around in a canister of 8 or 16mm film."

",-0.296,-0.7727,2018-06-23 00:00:00,5,"Its not as bad as many say, but its definitely not good either. I call it average similar to Transformers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The bad guy is back and is trying to recruit more kids to murder on his behalf. The problem however, is the story throws to much nonsense at you. You have the obligatory violent divorcee dad who owns half the state and has all the cops and judges in his pocket while he beats his wife and kids. You have children pretending to be scary, which falls flat. The ghost kids are just annoying, and no scary at all though i suppose they might be scary to kids. But kids are not watching this movie, adults are. The ending is a major laugh. You literally have a 10 year old running around with a camera in one hand and sickle in the other against 2 adults and another 10 year old... and they ran away from him lol. But wait the comedy is not over yet. The ran away on foot when there was a perfectly functional car 5 feet away from them which the man used to run down the camera kid just 30 second earlier... And it gets better, they get to their home and instead of arming themselves, they run and hide. Really? Can you imagine the Shining with a axe wielding 10 year old kid instead of Jack Nickleson? Thats what you have here and yes, it is as funny as it sounds.But anyway, the 1st half of the film was ok until the wife beating dad shows up conveniently to push the story forward. It became silly from then on."

It's not theologically possible. In any case, if you like the present-day Slasher Horror trend, you'll love this bit of Derrickson schwag. (His best was The Exorcism of Emily Rose.) This one ratchets up pretty high over the first installment, even giving the viewer a handful of unnecessary expletives and misogynistic terms from both psychopathic husband and soon-to-be-psychopathic son. I was raised on magazines like Creepy and Eerie, so there's not too much I didn't see before I reached my teenage years. Somehow, though, live action makes things that much more grittier and terrible than black-n-white, if well-drawn, comic stories. Only watch this one if you like fast-paced, jump-scare-filled, well-acted stories filled with ""people having bad days."""

",-0.5994,-0.8796,2018-05-29 00:00:00,5,"Sinister did not live up to the hype for me and so I had little hope for this, it's sequel. What's with this supposedly scary demon in these films? It's just some guy wearing a rubber Halloween mask, I've seen scarier looking members of Black/Death Metal bands than this!
I liked the idea of young brothers Dylan and Zak being made to watch shocking home movies by their ghostly friends. The developing relationship between their mother and the investigator was interesting. All of the acting was good. And I liked the obvious Children of the Corn homage. 
But the fact that it fails to be a scary horror film let's it down, and I certainly will not be getting excited by the thought of any more sequels."

The movie had a few jolts, but it wasn't as interesting because the family was boring and it was also a custody movie about the abusive father taking the kids away from his ex-wife. It was very weird watching both a heartfelt drama about an abusive father and an evil creature wanting to take a child away and kill the family. I realized it's especially hard to make a sequel to Sinister because he's just going to haunt another family, take children and can't die."

As for the movie, it has a decent plot and certainly very good acting but, it sort of fails to create a horror setting. The woman is oblivious to everything that's happening with her children which sort of kills the mood, and the ghost children are not scary at all. The ending definitely feels rushed, it happens so fast and it doesn't explain how the boy overpowered his entire family and strapped them as scarecrows.

" Spoilers follow ...
",0.0,0.6582,2017-11-24 00:00:00,7,"For a story about a bereaved mother with two young sons, this could have been a lot worse. I have a low tolerance for bratty depictions of troubled youngsters in films like this, and the often dewy-eyed mother's intense efforts in trying to 'understand' them. Luckily, that kind of drippery is in short supply here, with Director Ciaran Foy clearly more concerned with horror atmospherics.For any unacquainted with the original, it is difficult not to notice how little explanation there is for events here. In some ways it is a good thing that we head straight into the thrust of the narrative, but in others it must be frustrating playing 'the long game' in order for newcomers to be enlightened about the ongoing story.The main protagonist is Bughuul from the earlier film, who looks very much like the lead character in Top Cow's 'The Darkness' comics. He makes surprisingly brief appearances here – such restraint is commendable, although it would have been nice to see a little more of him. Perhaps nice is the wrong word.There are several story strands here, but sadly, only the evil ghostly children's growing influence on young Zack (Dartanian Sloan) has any sense of progression. Other interesting elements, like Zack becoming the bully his father Clint (Lea Coco) was, and the father's abusive behaviour towards the likable Courtney - as well as her relationship with the 'Ex-Deputy' - are plot-threads presented more or less in isolation amidst everything else, and they remain severely under-developed and subsequently not as interesting as they deserve to be.Despite the convincing acting, I feel that too much reliance is placed on the young cast members. It is too much to ask that scenes of such horrific 'weight' to them should be adequately conveyed by the juniors.The highlight for me here is Tomandandy's amazing, doom-laden score. Throughout, the music adds an extra layer of intensity and dark foreboding. The soundtrack is available to buy and makes for pretty unsettling listening on its own."

" A mediocre spin-off, this a different breed of movie than the first one
",0.0,-0.9913,2017-05-12 00:00:00,4,"To be brief, I will say that this is a different breed of movie than its prequel. Mediocre at best, while the level of violence seems to have increased, this a terrible horror flick and a bad movie. The drama is centered around a family conflict - a mother who has run away from her violent husband in order to protect her children. The husband is relentless is his pursuit for his children. Meanwhile, the vulnerable mother meets former sheriff deputy ""so and so"", with whom she develops a connection of a sort. This plot is almost independent of the Bughul subplot. It's almost an excuse rather than a genuine plot. Therefore, most of the movie feels artificial; emotions are not genuine. The first movie had the excellent acting of the protagonist (and the movie pretty much centers around him), whereas this one has a goofy former deputy and a troupe of cruel ghost-children. In general, it's not just the acting that has gone down a notch, but the very denouement of such an artificial, extremely clichéd plot made the acting feel much worse than it really was. For me, besides the attempt to create faux emotions, using violence as an instrument to shock, rather than a good story, one of the worst things of this movie was that it was effectively ""dumbed down"". It abused of the characters to communicate the entire mystery of the Bughul entity. With no mystery, there is no horror. This is why they had to recur to more violence, increased apparitions of supernatural figures (remember in the first movie when you hardly ever saw the Bughul?) to create reactions you can't create by doing a good, intelligent movie.There's nothing ""dark"" and disturbing in this movie. The word ""disturbing"" is what comes to my mind when I think of the first movie; not for this one, in spite of the use of some similar resources. I'm horror movie veteran, so I'm not easily shocked by gore. I don't mind the clever use of film-making resources to create an atmosphere, to elicit emotional responses, and so on. But, if that's all there is to it, then there really isn't much at all.The movie is watchable. It's not a good horror movie; it doesn't have any of the attributes of a good horror movie. It's a poor excuse for a sequel. 4/10."

No doubt, the cinema playing the film super loud helped elevate the jump scares though. The creepy depictions of murder in the first film were crazily overdone in this.The screenplay was terrible.

It was a drama with some scary parts--if that much.Buguul is after new prey and he's found them. A mother has ran away from her extremely abusive ex-husband and she has her two sons in tow. One of these two sons is chosen for the deed of offing his family. The majority of the movie is exposition about the mom, her ex, and the one ex machina character that is trying to prevent the next massacre. It is so bogged down with drama and visible ghosts that you wonder if they're even trying for horror. I contend that they were not. I think they figured they wouldn't be able to make a good horror sequel anyway so why try. Let's just use the same title, the same antagonist and somewhat of the same plot, throw in a couple of very unlikeable characters and then people will lap it up. This movie was lazy, over the top and just plain hard to watch. If everyone was killed in this drivel I would have been more inclined to applaud. There was no mystery to uncover, there were no characters that were beloved and there was nothing scary about this movie. It was sinister what they did to the viewers."

All questions of who and why the murders took place were all answered in the first film so in this film we know who the murderers would be and why and, considering we could see the ghost guiding them from the very beginning, this removed all suspense from the film - at every point in the film we knew what was going to happen next and how it was going to end. watching the ""snuff"" films in the first film were, naturally, disturbing - in this film they were just dumb and STILL didn't explain how a young child could tie up every other member of their family before killing them. About as ""sinister"" as the Teletubbies and just as predictable."
