" Underrated action COMEDY!! Great bluray!! Dynamite cast!
",0.8807,0.728,2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I love action comedies when there done right they are the best genre, come on bad boys.... this is a different action comedy featuring Simon pegg as a hit man come on need I say more????? Trust me it's a fun flick its not an oscar contender as its NOT boring. A little predictable but doesn't matter at least it doesn't end and you have to complete the movie on your own!!, I hate that!!"
" Love the direction
",0.6369,0.0,2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,This is how stories should be told. Kept me on the edge throughout!
" This film is unbelievably bad
",-0.5849,0.4125,2021-03-13 00:00:00,1,"I thought this would be OK based on the other reviews, but it's really quite awful.About half of the cast simply cannot act. I can't act myself, so I don't know what they are doing wrong, but it sounds like they are reading lines from a script, rather than actually saying things. All the time. In every scene. It's unbearable.Simon Pegg can act, but his performance is not enough to make this worth watching.The script also has some major plot holes."
" That actually surprised me
",0.2263,0.8348,2021-02-24 00:00:00,7,"I've been put off by this film for ages because all the ratings and reviews are terrible but I completely disagree. The film actually had good structure to it. Had a few nice twists, the acting wasn't bad and it had a nice ending. It even made me chuckle a few times so there's no complaints on my end. If you're debating it, just watch it, it's worth it."
" Just good clean fun!
",0.8478,0.8973,2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"For goodness sake don't take it too seriously, as some reviewers seem to have done. It really is just an hour and a half of cock-ups and erroneous killings, with some very good humour thrown in (especially from Lucy).
In my opinion this is Simon Pegg at his absolute best.
Relax and enjoy it."
" a dreadful bore
",-0.5994,0.3291,2021-02-06 00:00:00,3,"Not only am I unable to see how this is supposed to be a comedy, but it's such a pastiche of the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino style from the 1990ies that its only comedic elements are involuntary. To the point of having Mexican music in the Australian desert.Nevertheless the film is boring, and that's it."
" Kill Me Three Times
",-0.6908,0.5814,2021-01-17 00:00:00,4,"Kill Me Three Times is a bizarre hit-man comedy that takes place in Australia, and for some reason has Simon Pegg in it. However, despite portraying itself as a comedy and putting Pegg as the main character, I can't think of a single moment that actually made me laugh.But it's not just the comedy that falls flat. The whole film, even with everything it tried to do, felt extremely uninspired and soulless. I think I was engaged for the first five minutes, and that was mostly due to me not having any idea about what this movie was about. However, as soon as the plot and direction started to crystallize, I lost every last bit of interest. And the way it was structured certainly didn't help. For some odd reason, the film was split into three different acts. The first act, while often the most engaging, was also by far the most confusing. It left everything without explanation and the first third of the movie gave me the impression that stuff just happened for no particular reason. The second act tried its hardest to make me understand the reasons behind everything that had taken place but at that point, I just didn't care anymore. The second act also felt off due to the constant switching between flashbacks that explained the story and the current situation that moved the story forward towards its conclusion. Thankfully the story is as simple as they come, despite trying to create a wow effect towards the end with the seemingly endless twists. Had the plot been any more complicated, I think I would've really struggled with trying to follow along. And as Kill Me Three Times ultimately reached its third and final act, it became clear that any and all form of entertainment was relying on over-the-top kill scenes and the presumably cool plot twists.However, as dull and simple as the story was, the biggest problem was the lack of comedy. Simon Pegg is, without a doubt, the only saving grace here, as his presence alone was often enough to make the scene better than it had any right to be. Interestingly, though, even he seemed to stay away from any form of comedy. And while this type of film would've been completely fine without any connection to the comedy genre, it's evidently clear that Kill Me Three Times tried to be funny, at least at times. However, as far as my experience with it went, I didn't laugh once. And I do find it quite unfortunate that there was such a clear desire to create a comedy film. Because had that not been the case, I think that a lot of the story would've felt more impactful. But, since it took the direction it took, the resulting product often felt unfocused, and even the more serious scenes felt airy and weirdly impactless. It was almost as if there was an ever-present sense of supposed comedy. No matter the scene, I always assumed that I was supposed to laugh at something, which I rarely did.Now, I do have a theory as to why that might be. I can't help but feel like this entire film was nothing more than a chance for Simon Pegg to realize one of his many character fantasies. Kill Me Three Times tends to revolve around him and setting up scenes that allow him to do 'cool' stuff, be it throwing a cigarette out of a window nonchalantly, or looking pretentiously badass while shooting someone down. In fact, I'm almost convinced that this whole project was made so that Pegg could play a cool, care-free hit-man that lacks any and all sense of moral. And since it was Pegg that was the star of the show, it seems that it was almost mandatory that there should be comedy elements. Unfortunately, for the sake of this film, the odd mix of a little bit of everything makes for a dull, unimpactful, and lackluster experience.If someone were to ask me to describe this film to them, I think that the most accurate way for me to do so would be to compare it to the seemingly endless number of Australian drama tv-series. I'm talking about the ones that have at least ten seasons, and are always on a rerun on at least one channel. Kill Me Three Times often feels exactly like those shows feel, and the only thing that makes it feel different is the inclusion of Simon Pegg. While I didn't fully dislike it, the rare scene or sequence that actually felt worthwhile didn't even come close to making up for everything else. Although I'm sure that Simon Pegg had a great time making this and getting to live his fantasies, the final product doesn't deliver what it was supposed to."
" Bloody brilliant mate
",0.2263,0.296,2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Excellent, smart, funny and ironic. No need for a big dictionary here. Get over yourself pundits. Brilliant story and finally everyone getting what they deserve. No politics, no religion, no alterior motive here just good old fashioned greed, slapstick and wtf. X"
" Simon Pegg goes to Australia and makes this film fun to watch.
",0.5106,0.9554,2020-12-20 00:00:00,7,"Good cast, good story and nice landscapes. There is plenty of humor involved in this film and I enjoyed references in typical characters which you encounter in these style of crime-hitman-comedy movies. I don't think this movie is trying to take itself serious and that is a good thing. The story overall is interesting but nothing new, except for a nice run of continuous twists. Don't get discouraged by the low ratings; this is a fun Aussie film with Simon Pegg delivering once again. 7/10"
" Weird that Simon Pegg and Alice Braga would agree to be in this film.
",0.2023,0.9438,2020-11-19 00:00:00,6,"It makes no sense, they both seem to have been drunk or high off a skunks bum-crack when accepting roles to star in this. I can understand Bryan Brown and Luke Hemsworth being here seeing as it's a very Australian film but, beyond that it's just all a bit 'meh'.Experience: enjoyable for the most part, not as gripping as the script thinks it is and Simon Pegg is laughably soft when playing a ""hard man"".
It had a few interesting plot point that are just enough to keep you watching to see what happens but its very forgettable and pretty predictable once you reach the half way point.Other than that, work have asked me to working the following hours next week-- 7am - 3pm, go home, come back in at 8pm to take and put out a full stock delivery, so I'll go home at '?? O'clock', gogomeagainand then start work the next day at 8am. I'm sorry but I'm just not doing it."
" One of the worst movies of all time
",-0.6249,-0.1513,2020-11-16 00:00:00,1,"Seen it and came to the conclusion that it's just completely waste of time to watch this collection of senseless attached images with sound.
Unfortunately, would have loved to do something else in that time."
" Sergio Leone a la Australia
",0.0,0.1779,2020-11-16 00:00:00,10,"Simon Pegg is a funny Clint Eastwood who starts off by killing a man from afar and then closer. He talks on his cell during thr last shots. It's a fun watch because Pegg is a perfect funny assassin. He has a light touch that makes him invincible. And there's money to be had. A girl survives one killing, two killings, and you will have to watch this film."
" Better than it's rating suggests
",0.4404,0.9705,2020-11-07 00:00:00,7,I think non-American humour is always under rated on IMDB. Lots of my favourite black comedies just seem to miss the mark with US reviewers and this is another example of that. It's a perfectly fun and enjoyable film with a good central role played by Simon Pegg. An entertaining couple of hours for when you don't want anything too taxing.
" Great movie
",0.6249,0.8124,2020-10-24 00:00:00,10,Low budget but very catching and easy to watch. Both my wife and i liked it a lot.
" Worth Persisting With
",0.2263,0.9843,2020-10-10 00:00:00,6,"This movie is a real mixed bag as it combines some excellent ideas with poor execution. I am in two minds whether it is underrated or over rated. I suspect if you do like it on first watching, further watches will increase your appreciation for it.The premise of the story surrounds a husband's hiring of a hitman (played by Simon Pegg) to kill his wife and how that plays out. The story is told three times giving us a slightly different perspective and providing additional layers of story uncovering different plot line and motivations of the different characters with a number of twists.The story told is actually interesting and does gets better and more intriguing as the film progresses, however it suffers from a particular slow and tedious first act (which i would suggest trying to get through). The opening scene is somewhat ridiculous and has a comical chase between the hitman and his victim, but this daft humour for the most part doesn't continue through the first act, so as a watcher you are not entirely sure what type of movie you are watching.Watching this movie i couldn't help thinking that a better director and producer could have put created an excellent movie. The ideas are great, the script is reasonable, but the dialogue in many instances is fairly terrible. The casting is very mixed, whilst Pegg is a star he stands out amongst a very average and limited ability cast, some of the acting is incredibly wooden I'm looking at any scene with Hemsworth, particularly in the garage. That being said Pegg's character does not seem to be consistent from one act to another. The visuals are at odds with themselves. Some good bright cinematography, nice blood work but poor fire effects mixed with a daytime soap vibe in many of the 'talking scenes' inside.And that's where we are, my overriding feeling i get from his movie is that Home and Away tried to make a Pulp Fiction - esque feature. Maybe i'm being unkind here comparing it to a daytime soap, but it very much has that feel in many scenes (not just because it is set in Australia). Likewise it feels like a TV movie rather than a feature, which i guess it very much may be, without knowing the full background.Ultimately I would say this is a reasonable watch, worth persisting with, has some clever and interesting ideas, but lacking in many areas."
" Great movie!
",0.6588,0.8591,2020-10-05 00:00:00,8,Excellent tall round fun crime movie with a perfectly woven plot combined with refreshing Australian scenery and acting. Put it to the top of your must see movies.
" Stale, unoriginal, crime comedy
",-0.25,-0.6587,2020-10-01 00:00:00,4,"First point to make, this film is obviously trying to be a dark comedic crime film. But I'm struggling to think of a time I actually laughed.Writer James McFarland was obviously heavily influenced by Guy Ritchie and similar crime comedies. If you have watched the likes of lock stock, italian job, seven psychopaths etc. this film does nothing new. The big issue however is that it does everything we've seen before but does it worse than the films it's emulating.It's shot out of sequence, but the story isn't compelling enough to make you wonder why and keep you watching. Characters were stereotypical and not fleshed out enough (crooked cop, cheating wife, gambling addict, etc.) and often defined by this one characteristic. Worst of all, none of them were likable. They were all villainous or amoral, even the ones the audience is supposed to be rooting for. And I love Simon Pegg, but he's horribly mis-cast here. Not at all believable in the role.When we finally got to the end, I felt like I was watching what was supposed to be a happy ending, but I didn't care. I didn't like the characters that survived and escaped with the money, and furthermore, I found myself questioning the ending. There was a ton of evidence to link certain characters to certain crime scenes and I couldn't see how they would get away with any of it. And that's usually the case in films such as this, but usually you're able to put aside the logical thinking and enjoy the movie. That wasn't possible here, as there was nothing to really enjoy."
" Typical offbeat Aussie movie.
",0.0,0.7904,2020-09-29 00:00:00,6,"They managed to assemble a really good cast for what I imagine was a small budget flick. Basically the movie is a black comedy centred around a hit-man, played by Simon Pegg. The acting is fine, the script is a bit weak in areas but overall still quite watchable. The Aussies have a great knack for putting out low budget quirky movies that appeal to lots of people. There was a time when the U.K did the same."
" Bad people
",-0.5423,-0.9118,2020-09-24 00:00:00,4,"Who am I supposed to care about in this movie? Everyone is horrible. Lying, cheating, thieving, murdering people."
" Not funny, not gripping, just pointless
",-0.3412,-0.6741,2020-09-11 00:00:00,3,"I'm sorry to say that overall this movie is a complete waste of time. It's really not funny, nor is it anything else. I'm surprised it got made. I think it's supposed to be a dark comedy but it's hard to tell. I thought that with Simon Pegg starring it would be good, alas I was wrong. It's a snooze fest. Skip to the end!"
" Good movie

It's fun to watch, it gets quite dense at times and there's not a single moment of boredom in it. It's time well spent.If you simply hate anything that's not done in Hollywood, if you need selfish stars instead of a well coordinated ensemble, well..."

" I wished it had been enjoyable
",0.4404,0.2477,2020-09-09 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to like this film, I really like Simon Pegg but it's just better when he writes the scripts himself. This film has been done before, it is so predicatable. I realized that I didn't care about any of the characters (not even the ""good ones"" really) beacause they are just empty, either empty psychopaths or just empty. And it's not really that funny. Combining an absurd story with people getting shot does not make a film a dark comedy."
" Loved what the critics hated
",-0.3612,0.8271,2020-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Darkly humorous - a genre that Pegg loves, as well as comic in its delivery of hapless events, the story follows its characters, looping back to moments that add clarity to key plot points as it goes"

",0.0,0.851,2020-09-03 00:00:00,5,"Not much else to say... acting is decent, but the script isn't and don't be fooled by the comedy tag and the fact that Simon Pegg is in it, this is not a comedy in any way."

If only Greg McLean (Wolf Creek) had stayed on as Director, Ben Mendelsohn stayed on as Nathan Webb and they didn't tack a silly happy ending on for the $$$, oh and cast anyone other than Simon Pegg as a killer we could have had visceral, bloody film that could have put Australian Cinema back on the map.
Alas instead we got two dogs - Kill Me 3 times and Wolf Creek 2!"
" Overkill
",0.0,0.4681,2020-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Or not enough kill? It depends on how you see it. We have quite a lot of bad people here. And no one is to be trusted. In a sense this sometimes might try to be more clever than it is. But it is fun to watch. Even Simon Pegg. And I say this, because while he is a fun guy in real life, he plays quite the killer here. And still most probably will sort of root for him.He's not worse than other people here though. The greed, the envy, the bad intentions ... all layed bare. With some time twisting ... still overall predictable but a lot of fun to watch"
" Edge of the seat thriller laced with dark humour
",0.5423,0.9391,2020-05-29 00:00:00,8,"This movie is for you if
you enjoy a gripping story mixed with good acting, nice camera work and tight editingcritical remarks like ""isn't that a derivative of what we have already seen from Tarantino, Guy Ritchie et al"" don't bother youWhat starts as an intriguing sequence of events turns into an edge of the seat affair by the time you are into the 30th minute. A must watch for thriller buffs and if you are a Simon Pegg fan, that's one more reason why you should not miss it."
" Love Conquers All
",0.6369,0.9703,2019-12-12 00:00:00,6,"Fun little flick with a few good laughs and some nice twists. Simon Pegg and the rest of the cast do well, production is good. All in all not as funny as Hot Fuzz, but entertaining enough. Recommended if you like to enjoy such crime action comedies like Hotel Artemis, Hot Fuzz, Snatch, In Bruges, The Big Lebowski etc."
" HE FORCED MY HAND
",0.0516,0.882,2018-11-20 00:00:00,7,"The film starts off with three killings of which we know nothing about. It is told as sequential flashbacks, pardon my oxymoron. Charlie Wolfe of ""Wolfe Superior Solutions"" is a private detective and hitman. He is hired to keep tabs on a cheating wife (Alice Braga) by a successful bar owner (Callan Mulvey). Luke Hemsworth plays her boyfriend. Nathan Webb (Sullivan Stapleton) is a dentist who knows horses less than he thinks which causes some pecuniary issues which needs immediate attention. His wife Lucy (Teresa Palmer) is his receptionist and is aware of the problem.This is a grindhouse film which follows the formula. It has quirky characters, F-bombs, blood squirts, sex, and nudity (Alice Braga). Being filmed in Australia it is light on the sex and nudity. Had I had never seen a grindhouse before, I would think this would be a great film. The problem is that this film falls into the pack. The twisty plot was not predictable, but expected. Acting and dialogue was good for the genre. I was mildly entertained in spite of the positive qualities."
" Some satisfaction arises in its third-act but, sadly, it's short-lived.
",-0.4118,0.024,2018-08-06 00:00:00,5,"'Kill Me Three Times (2015)' actually starts to come together quite nicely in its third act, which is strangely given an eponymous label under the guise of being the flick's final 'story' - despite the picture having a single, and entirely insular, narrative that only varies from a 'standard structure' in the way that its second act takes place chronologically before the first. In this final movement, each disparate element barrels towards one another in a purposefully frustrating and fairly satisfying way. However, it's during this phase that the only real characters come into focus, revealing their true nature as either despicable and ultimately disposable or consistently undeveloped and bizarrely heralded (by the picture) as heroes. It's a shame that their true intentions or personality often prevent you from rooting for or even empathising with any of them, until they all start disappearing from the plot and you're left with the unsatisfying, standard 'good guys' to root for despite the fact they've been absent, and as brutal as the other players, for much of the run-time. 5/10"
" Don't Miss Out on This One
",0.1139,0.9589,2017-11-22 00:00:00,6,"I recommend this one to movie lovers for its clever plot. I have never seen such a clever plot that keeps twisting throughout the whole movie. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much out of this movie, given the British accent. Don't get me wrong! It's just that I'm not familiar with the British movies as much as I am with American movies. I just don't get the British way of rending movies. I salute the writer for this clever plot. It's really gripping. At the beginning, I didn't really get what was going on, but later I realized that something smart was being done on the screen. Some real entertainment. Don't miss out on this one."
" Not blood simple
",0.0,-0.8705,2017-09-11 00:00:00,5,"Kill Me Three Times is a blackly comic crime thriller set in Australia. In the small coastal community Alice Taylor (Alice Braga) is suspicious of her abusive husband Jack Taylor (Callan Mulvey.) Jack has good reason for his suspicions as she is having an affair with mechanic Dylan Smith (Luke Hemsworth) and she also plans to steal from her husband and run away with Dylan.Jack hires hit-man Charlie Wolfe (Simon Pegg) to follow her and then take her out.

As you watch the film more subplots are revealed as there is more backstabbing than a Roman senate meeting.Brazilian actress Braga shines, Pegg plays against type as a nasty hit-man who seems to bounce back more times than the Terminator. The film is derivative but improves as it goes along helped by its Australian setting."
" Entertaining, but not thrilling enough
",-0.3359,0.9966,2017-04-19 00:00:00,7,"Kill Me Three Times is off to a great start even during the opening credits. The music is catchy, the credits look amazing, and they don't take too long. And after the opening credits, the first lines are intriguing. All this ensures the viewer will stay to see what happens.The theme song of the movie that already catches your attention in the opening credits is used throughout the movie. This is also taking a huge risk, because you could overuse that too much. However, in this case, that track is simple enough to use several times. It's exciting and perfect for an action comedy. Reminds me of the theme of Men In Black.The story is funny (though the humour is dark), and it's just complex enough.Most of the complexity comes from non-chronological narrative. That's always risky, but when done right, it works, just like in this movie. The plot isn't just straight-forward and ""as is"", but James McFarland clearly did not try too hard to write some kind of artistic, complicated action thriller. The amount of complexity is just right when it comes to action comedy. You can be clever in other ways when writing a movie like this, mostly by plot twists that the audience cannot see miles away. Kill Me Three Times succeeds in that. However when it comes to the plot twists it feels like maybe this movie won't be as great when you see it the second time. It feels like while the movie is very charming and somewhat unique and funny, it's not as clever as you'd like, or as thrilling. But can I be sure before I actually rewatch it?"
